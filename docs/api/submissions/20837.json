Weird take.", "Yup", "Why is that the correct thing? Like i said, it only negatively affects the kids. From how stupid and shitty the mom sounds i cant imagine they have very good lives.

And he might have been held liable. She put him at risk and she doesn't seem to care about it. Boohoo, poor mom, but like, she knowingly committed fraud and she did it intentionally against him. And she's doubling down by demanding he not get on with his life (and it's been years at this point) and keep a house/not sell/delay sale so her kids, not his, can keep committing fraud.\n\nThis woman isn't doing herself or her kids any favors.

Don't waste time saying something along the lines of we should fund the bad schools more, if that was going to happen it would have already and few towns have funding to throw around like that on their own. What, in this moment, under their control, are towns (rich or otherwise) supposed to do?", "Unfortunately, that is a risk she actively chose to take. What exactly are you expecting OP to do in this situation? They've been separated for years. They're not his children. His house is already on the market and they're already established to move locations. \n\nIt doesn't sound like OP has any intent to report the situation as it currently stands, only to continue with their rightful plan of moving. Its up to her to manage the result of her choices, as unfortunate as that is. What she's demanding is not realistic, even more so with today's housing market and cost of living. \n\nI do hope the children get to stay in their current school, but they not involved at all.

Deny having any knowledge or being involved in any way bc 10/10 chance if that crazy ass woman goes down she will do her very best to drag OP into it and bring him down with her somehow. 7 On top of point#6 even in the best case scenario with the least amount of drama involved, OP gains literally nothing and those children get fucked over for no reason. If he reports this then he is literally just doing it out of spite and malice and potentially risking placing himself right in the middle of it when he can just ignore it and do what he was doing anyways and move out of state", "I meant in the future tense, but I can see by your other comments how you'd have problems inferring probabilities. There's also the likelihood of a family buying that house and having kids and then it would crop up then. You're defending the actions of someone in the wrong with a bunch of what ifisms and 'but he could have'. Sure. He COULD have, but she's an ex, they aren't his kids, and he's not obligated to hold himself in a position of legal liability because she's criminally minded. It's not morally correct to 'do nothing'. Didn't you ever watch Boondock Saints? (that's a tongue in cheek reference, but the reference there is that a good man doesn't stand idly by while evil is happening. Is this evil? No, but she's morally and legally in the wrong and he's trying to do his civil and legal best and 'just do nothing' is a shit way of looking at the world.)\n\nHe's reporting them because he's legally obligated to do once he realizes his address/identity is being used fraudulently.

First off i literally said i wasn\u2019t justifying her actions lmao i was merely offering up my opinion about how to handle the predicament this crazy woman put OP in. Second, You just tried to prove ur point using a what if scenario while ALSO trying to belittle me by assuming i was trying to defend the psycho ex by using what if scenarios\u2026. LOL\u2026. Third, i dunno if you know this but people can live life by different moral codes. what you believe to he moral is not always going to be what i believe to be moral.

I just think your stance of 'do nothing' is bullshit and you're trying to put some kind of onus on the guy who had a dipshit ex who has felonious intent. You're making it seem like it's his fault when he's tried to do the right thing. Like, the TRUE right thing is to just let her get away with it. Your opinion is clearly skewed and not jiving with the majority rule opinion, which is 'screw that noise, call her out'. \n\nThink about perspectives all you want, but the fact is that you're advocating an idea that isn't going over well and there's a reason for it. Because it's screwing an innocent person over when he did nothing wrong. And there's too many vengeful people here, myself included in a petty way, to want her to just get off with having done something so shitty and shady without some kind of payback. She fucked up. He did not. He got his dick all the way out of crazy town and she still drove by to fuck his life up. And now she's trying to tell him to 'hold off on selling the house so my kids can go to school'. That's where people are giving you shit, because 'do nothing' doesn't apply here.", "YTA you re cold hearted.", "NTA. Your ex had no right to use your address like this without even telling you.

That's something at the very minimum that requires the cooperation of the poor dupe who's being used!", "NTA\n\nOk, i dont know how it works where you are. But where i live, you are listed on the electoral register, with your address. This is used for tax purposes along with it being used as evidence as previous adresses and such. \nI suggest if there are any official records like this, you request they be checked, to see if she has listed herself living at your address. It would need removing. You can explain the situation. But this will back you up in terms of issues with tax, fraud accusations, even potential legal ramifications. If shes taken out credit policies against your address it can fall back on you as the owner of the property etc\nYou need to have a good look into records, maybe ask a solicitor to see if they can advise any departments that need to be notified in order to cover your back.
