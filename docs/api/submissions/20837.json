There\u2019s no need to keep your ex in the loop if you didn\u2019t have kids together", "NTA.

Her shitty circumstances are not your problem.", "NTA You went above by telling her you were moving. I wouldn't have done that. Her missing mail is her issue.", "NTA.  The ex was taking advantage of OP, unbeknownst to him.  Not his responsibility to provide an address for the kids, or to prop up the ex when she's out of work.", "NTA. She\u2019s the one committing fraud here (and likely making poor life decisions that got/kept her in the situation she\u2019s in). I feel for her kids, but they\u2019re also not your responsibility.", "I can tell why this woman is your ex.  She's been using your address for her kids for years and never mentioned it once to you?  Did she think you would never move?  Now she thinks you should light yourself on fire to keep her warm.  She seems to think she is entitled to tell you what to do all because it's better for her kids.  Good luck to her, maybe the new owner of your home will forward her mail for her.", "NTA you didn\u00b4t even know she was using your address! No reason you owe her anything.", "NTA- She intentionally lied for years using your address. You were kind to reach out re: her mail and she dumps guilt and blame on you. Shake it off.

My son\u2019s school requires a recent electrical bill showing your name and address of your home to enroll each year. It is for just this reason so people don\u2019t lie to be in a school they aren\u2019t zoned for. NTA but you might reach out to the school and let them know she somehow slipped through. If she is doing it, others might be too", "I can sympathize with her, and find your lack of empathy about it somewhat disturbing, but overall, you have no obligation to help her keep up lies, or risk losing out on the sale of your own home. You can move as you wish without informing every ex. \n\nNTA\n\nBut... I'm very very strongly hoping that none of her kids are yours, because if any of them are, my opinion is going to change very quickly, and dramatically.", "ESH Your ex definitely sucks ass obviously but honestly i feel like there is plenty of better ways for you to go about this as well, you sound like you just dont care about her and her situation but why go out of your way to put a stop to something that only really affects the kids. Honestly inclined to think this is fake considering how little the educational system cares about students and their families\u2026 i doubt theyd care enough to actually be checking up on things like this so as long as you dont go out of your way to say anything i dont see why she cant just not say anything either and its no big deal and the kids stay at that school", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No wonder she\u2019s your ex\u2026.she\u2019s TA for using your address without telling you. The nerve of that woman.", "NTA - like you said 'not your kids'", "NTA. You didn't even KNOW she was using the address for her kids to go to a different district, and there's no way in hell that you should pull your house OFF the market at this point or delay the sale for her. It's unfortunate that she's in this situation, and even sadder still that school districts in this country are not equal. It's a huge problem and it is unfair, but it's not YOUR fault, or your responsibility to correct. \n\nIf she had been upfront with you, you maybe would have helped her out, maybe not, but she would have had more notice. It's too late now, and her situation is her own fault. Did she think it would never catch up with her? It's a shame, but again - it's not your problem. It's your house to sell, and your life, and you should continue doing exactly as you had planned before.  She has been using your address for fraudulent purposes without your knowledge or permission for quite some time.... she has no standing to be mad at you about anything.", "Make sure you document your surprise and disgust at her fraud scheme in your text when you respond to her. She seems like the type that will try and claim \u201cvictim\u201d if she\u2019s caught. She would probably say you convinced her to do it and didn\u2019t tell her you moved.", "NTA. While it\u2019s wrong for her to use your address, I can understand why she did.

I would contact the school district and tell them you found out what she was doing.  Don't know what the laws are, but she sounds like the type to say you allowed her to use your address.", "NTA\n\n>I\u2019m sorry you never found the support system she needed\n\ndoes this mean she never looked for it or she did but never received it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder where the father of the 3rd child is in all this, considering she already had the first two when they met\n\nIt's a difficult situation for her and her children indeed, but you can't be responsible of her bad decisions (I mean the address thing and nothing more)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is fraud, protect youself", "nta she can\u2019t hold you back she is an ex for a reason I would block her because she is being disrespectful just because you are moving that\u2019s not right", "I also wonder about her kids and the school lunch program. If she is that poor, but is lying about the residence, how is she maintaining eligibility for school lunch. In my state, schools with enough eligible kids can give every child breakfast and lunch, but schools in more wealthy areas expect the family to show need.", "If they lived with him at any point at the address she would have proof of residence to register them that school year, but I\u2019ve never heard of schools requiring proof beyond that initial year unless there is a problem. At every school I\u2019ve worked at, he proof of residence goes into a cumulative folder that follows the student. If they move within the district, a new proof is required, but since she\u2019s been using the same one it likely has never been questioned.", "I wondered this. \n\nHave the school never sent a letter?", "How is he going out of his way to stop something?  He contacted the ex to tell her he\u2019s moving and she needs to update her address, as he won\u2019t be in the house to forward it. She\u2019s the one being difficult.", "Here in the states, parents have went to jail for using a fake home address to enroll their kids in schools. It\u2019s sounds ridiculous, but there are places that absolutely do check these things. If OP knowingly let her use his address, he may get in to trouble as well.", "OP *isn\u2019t* going out of their way to do anything aside from moving forward with their move as scheduled. They said that *if* they had known, they\u2019d have put a stop to it, but they didn\u2019t say they\u2019d be contacting the district or anyone; why would they? It\u2019s not their problem since they\u2019re leaving the home. Whatever follows is the kids\u2019 mom\u2019s issue to handle. *She* created the situation and now *she* is responsible for any fallout.", "Bad take", "I think that it is obvious he doesn't care about her or her situation. That in itself doesn't make him an AH, we don't have any information on how the relationship ended.\n\nI agree on the school not checking though, unless the new owners contact the school and inform them those kids do not live there.\n\nNTA", "To have eligibility the parents fill out a form at the beginning of the year that states their income. It has absolutely nothing to do with an address for individual eligibility.", "From the sounds of it (\"she NOW has three kids\") one of the kids wasn't even born when they last were together.", "My son's school only used email.", "\u201cIm sure that\u2019s illegal and if i had know i would have put a stop to it\u201d", "OP doesnt have to \u201cknow\u201d anything regarding this situation. I suggested he did nothing actually. Doing something is the only way for them to find out, and going by your logic OP could already get in trouble, so why not just do nothing and let the crazy ex deal with it? He wont even be in the state anymore soon enough. Plus even if this chick goes to jail over this idk if thats worst case scenario for these kids tbh lmao", "I completely agree. I made multiple points throughout my comments but over all i was just defending the kids lol seems like everyone focused on one thing i said that they don\u2019t agree with and ran wit it", "Wow what a thoughtful response big dawg. Take you all day to think of it?", "Thats fair, she sounds like a problematic annoying prick. And those kids gotta deal with having whatever presumably crappy life someone like her is capable of providing. My point is why would he go out of his way to make the kids have to go to a shitty school? He can literally just do nothing. Its not his problem and doesnt affect him in the slightest. All telling the school does is make those kids shitty lives even shittier. If the school district really truly cared then they could have easily found out by now on their own", "Yes. She\u2019s committing fraud and using him to do so. The correct thing for him to do is to contact the school district and inform them as the property owner that she and her children do not reside there", "So for you it\u2019s better if the ex goes to jail then if the kids just have to go to another school district? Weird take.", "Yup", "Why is that the correct thing? Like i said, it only negatively affects the kids. From how stupid and shitty the mom sounds i cant imagine they have very good lives. Whats the harm in simply doing nothing so they can go to a better school with their friends? Plus if the school cared enough they could figure it out on their own\u2026 its not like the kids have lived there this whole time anyways", "No, I dont wish jail upon her lol In a perfect world the kids get to stay at the nice school with their friends and the ex turns a new leaf and becomes an all around upstanding citizen. In reality, though, crazy people don\u2019t usually just wake up one day and decide to change their life for the better\u2026 maybe some consequences might cause that seemingly much needed change in her. Nothing hits people with a dose of reality quite like some jail time. And just maybe wherever the kids end up might produce better opportunities for them than whatever mindset is being instilled in them being raised by a psycho unemployed mother", "Because she\u2019s committing criminal fraud and once he finds out, if he doesn\u2019t do anything to stop it, he is aiding and abetting. And as Michael Jordan once said, \u201cFuck them kids.\u201d"]}
