NONE of this should be happening over facebook updates.", "Plus she deserves some public shaming.", "The SD is 19 and she already knows the egg donor plays favorites. Now the SD has more evidence her Step Mom is on her side.", "Correct, but now i really want an egg d\u00f6ner (also known as donair or gyro)", "Then why\u2019d you spell it wrong?  Doner isn\u2019t a word", "If a mom explicitly says they have a favorite child, they are by definition an AH. Yes, all parents will have a child they connect with more or like more, but to put a post on Facebook to explicitly say your son is the favorite child and imply it\u2019s the other child\u2019s fault for not buying you an expensive present? \n\nYou think the scapegoat child should just shut up about it when there is clear favoritism? I hope if you become a parent you will be a better one than you\u2019re describing.", "Yeah, no. You\u2019re playing devils advocate here and it\u2019s misplaced. A good mom would never openly admit she\u2019s got a favourite child. There\u2019s clearly favouritism, and sd clearly is aware it\u2019s not in her favour. That\u2019s such an icky thing to do as a parent to your child, I have no sympathy for a mother that openly makes the choice to be a loving mom to one of her children, and a sh\u00eet mom to the other child. I hope she comes to her senses and starts healing her relationship with her daughter.", "Wholeheartedly agree.", "This.", "Lol \"egg donor\" so cringe, obviously they have some form of relationship it's not NC. I assume that the bio mum raised her for most of her life.", "Same...", "Thanks. Now I want a kebab", "Typo at 12:00am", "Doner Kebabs", "Kid started the online battle. Bio mom shouldnt have joined it.", "I didnt say she was a GOOD mom... Normal or even bad moms can get saucy when theyre fed up, though. Doesnt mean the daughter was right to post.", "Not an English word, which I thought was implied, since we\u2019re speaking English.", "Sure doesn\u2019t, but social media is used by everyone basically and almost everyone uses it as a way to display emotions. Even here. A lot of the AITA posts are super personal and shouldn\u2019t be posted looking for a bunch of strangers to weigh in, but here we are weighing in on things that really aren\u2019t our business. It\u2019s all petty somehow, so I don\u2019t really see it as an issue that OP \u201cretaliated\u201d by having her sd back. I\u2019m unsure as to why you\u2019re defending the mom, giving her an out for being \u201cfed up\u201d, but is the daughter also not allowed to be fed up with her mom constantly choosing her brother over her? It goes both ways is what I\u2019m trying to say. Also, maybe you should stop and wonder why a child would CHOOSE to go no contact with their parent. Most children only want acceptance, and love from their parents. It\u2019s a HARD decision to cut your parents out, even when they\u2019re bad parents.", "English folk know wtf a doner kebab is. Try saying you're speaking American instead.", "There's no need to be rude about it.", "It's a very difficult decision to cut out any parent and I don't want to downplay that at all. However in my experience people are a lot judgier about moms. I feel like we have more pop culture touchstones about shitty dads, maybe? I treaded very lightly at sd's age (I usually, if asked, said \"we're not close\") but I got a lot of judgement even for that.", "US American here that knows what Doner Kebab is", "Yeah, I\u2019m also not close with my mom because of things. I\u2019ve always gotten weird looks for saying my mom and I don\u2019t get along, and that I\u2019ve made the choice to go Low contact with her since I was twelve basically. Still to this day that choice hurts my heart, and I yearn for the relationship I never got to have with her. I\u2019m almost 32 now. It\u2019s not easy to cut out parents.", "Oh, so am I (and I just found out there's a doner kebab shop a half hour from where I live!) I've just also heard my English wife bitch about Americans acting high and mighty about \"speaking English\" when it's a nightmare chimera cobbled together from multiple different languages. My apologies for the generalization, though."]}
