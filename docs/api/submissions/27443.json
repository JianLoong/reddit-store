Are they valid? The daughter made low effort for the mom's birthday, which may be becuase she's tired of the mom doing the same to her, or it may be how she usually treats her mother which is why she spends more time with the brother.

In which case, her daughter taking your side, no matter how much time has passed, would be deeply upsetting. This may explain why the brother, who's older and better understands what was going on, spends so much time with bio mom, but the younger daughter has been left confused and hurt.
