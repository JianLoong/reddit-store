Your should be teaching your stepdaughter to move on from those people in her life, not find a way to perpetuate the cycle. \n\nMost importantly you haven't helped your SD in any way and probably in fact made it worse for your SD. \n\nNext time don't stoop down to that level.", "ESH except maybe the kids.
