I\u2019ve never believed in the idea of marriage so my wedding is more sort of a spiritual ceremony to combine two souls. So it\u2019s a very untraditional wedding that is just for me and my partner so I don\u2019t care if someone is upset for not being invited. I only want people who truly love me and my partner to be there for something that is a huge step for me. \n\nI have not lived with my mom since I was 16. We never had a good relationship and she was not a very good mother to me. My partners mother was more involved in my life than my own. She didn\u2019t even come to my high school graduation or call. From 18-21 I had barely any contact with my mom. We didn\u2019t live in the same state and there was no reason to see each other. I didn\u2019t reconnect with my dad until I was 23 and our relationship in this short time is better than mine with my mom. I\u2019ve tried to fix my relationship with my mom in recent years and she has had no interest in me and continues to criticize me. \n\nSo naturally I didn\u2019t invite her to my wedding which is in 2 weeks. My partner respects my decision as he\u2019s seen first hand what our relationship is like. My stepdad called me saying my mom was really upset to find out I was getting married and they weren\u2019t invited. I told him that I\u2019m not changing my decision and if they show up they will not be allowed in. My brother who is a momma\u2019s boy told me I was being a bitch and immature. My father thinks I will regret it later if my mom isn\u2019t at my wedding because i am just \u201cmad\u201d right now. My sister has no opinion on the matter but says if my mom shows up I should allow her in so she doesn\u2019t cause a scene and ruin my day. I told her to tell my mom that she will be escorted out if she comes. So am I the asshole or is my reasoning justified?", "created_utc": 1681038349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ggbt2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mom_to_my_wedding/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have a good, mother-free wedding OP.  Might be time to cut ties with her if you can.

You don't have a relationship with your mother, so it's not like this would be burning any bridges and it is your wedding.

No cake for bad moms.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding and you can invite whomever you want. It doesn't seem like you are being petty or short-sighted.

She cant just play good mom on your wedding after her past.\n\nIn the end, your wedding is your event. My mother didn't invite her mom to her wedding.

Guests at a wedding are there to bear witness and be a supporting factor in the relationship.  If your mother was an abrasive factor in your life, it doesn't meet the qualifications.  It is an honor to be invited to a wedding as you are one of a chosen few that are considered important in the couples life.

What idiotic opinions you hear from people. Why would you regret it? You don't like her, end of story.\n\nAs for letting her in if she shows up, no way.
