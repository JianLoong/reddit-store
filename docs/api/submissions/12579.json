Can you talk with a therapist to help sort through this to decide the best thing to do?", "NTA. \n\nBut it sounds like the boys are teenagers so there is a good chance that the courts would ask them where they want to live and who they want to see. It looks like they are between 14 and 17. Assuming you have a reasonable lawyer who is not overcharging you the fight might not be as tough as you think it is.", "Sorry for your loss. It's probably best for you to go to Illinois for family support. Unfortunately courts usually side with bio parents, you are not abandoning them, only being realistic. This far and away beyond AITA forum.", "Nta.

It\u2019s clear this very tragic situation isn\u2019t going to being solved over night.  Your daughter will always be related to those boys, so you have clout there.

All 3 of them are going to be dramatically affected by this and eventually a lot of regrets and resentments will take place. This isn\u2019t the time to have imposter syndrome. You ARE their dad.

For now forward it to a close (research and planning) support AT MOST (so you know if anything urgent they\u2019d tell you - and you can stop thinking for now) - if you have a friend you trust to read and map your timeline needed if any. If you would like - DM me. I\u2019m great at this type of research. \n\n3/ Look at custody rights for your daughter to stay in her brothers\u2019 lives and vice versa in due time.\n\n4/ For the future I\u2019d imagine you may stay and build a life where you are with visitation for the siblings (and yourself). Or you can move home and the visits be arranged over school holidays - is Illinois travel distance and within budget for you to cover that would be part of the research and planning. Keep in mind when the boys can decide where they\u2019ll live by state/fed laws idk. Maybe eventually they can move to you if things don\u2019t work out with the paternal side. You just need 3 to maintain a relationship meanwhile.\n\nFor now - one step at a time, and no deadline for you - and recognize now is not the time to make major decisions. Take care of yourself first. Wishing you all the best of outcomes and the future", "My heart just broke. I am very sorry for your losses. \nWhat I do not get is, what was child protection service doing? I mean the boys were allready traumatisised by the death of their mother and then they lost their home, their family - the adult they trusted the most. \nIt was not in their interest to be taken out of their home. Where I live, children\u2018s interests are also being eroded, but there\u2018s a law that the interests of the children come before the interests of the adults. Maybe there\u2018s something similar in your state?\nYou need your family too now. I would try to get in contact with the boys, visits should be declared as something that is in the children\u2018s interest. Let them know that you want them. They have rights, they don\u2018t have to be nice and swallow this violation. Being nice is helping the abusers (people who do something cruel like that are abusers).\nSo if they are aware they could try to get other authorities involved, like a school counselor etc. If this people are annoyed and don\u2019t want to work, go a Level higher. Are they on social media? Let them know that you love them. And that they are having a place wherever you are. \nYou need your family too, once you tried to get the boys and it didn\u2019t work out, make sure, that they know where and how to find you and go to your family. Put money aside for a trainticket, something like that. \nIt is a horrible situation, you will need the advice of a good lawyer. Maybe you can get one for the boys? Don\u2018t know if it is possible. What I know is, that being reasonable and trying to find a way of dealing with something like this in a too gentle way is always playing in the hands of the abusers and the people who don\u2018t want to do their jobs.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nPlease stop thinking about this and concentrate on taking care of yourself.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. The best thing I can offer is to keep in contact with them, and like u/SirRabbott said, explain to them exactly who is responsible for them not seeing you. Plant the seeds in their minds about who is looking out for them (you) and who is trying to cause trouble (their grandparents). Hopefully, once they\u2019re 18, they will choose to live with you.", "Please make sure the boys have the means to keep in touch with you - if they don't have phones, get them phones and make sure they have your number.  Tell them, if you can find an opportunity, that you care about them and want them to stay with you, but you don't have a legal way to do that.  Perhaps you can tell the grandparents that you want to say goodbye to the boys, so that they give you the chance to speak to them.  Also, you could write them each a heartfelt letter and make sure they know you still care about them.  They lost their mother, and now they are losing the man who has been their father for all this time.\n\nIf the grandparents are that hostile to you, could you make some kind of arrangement with a neighbour that you will write to the boys via them?  You could give them permission to read the letters, to satisfy themselves that you are not doing anything wrong.  Encourage your daughter to write to them as well.\n\nI don't think it would be wrong of you to leave, and return to your home state, so long as you do everything you can to ensure the boys know you still care about them.\n\nPerhaps when you settle into your new home, you will gain the equilibrium to continue to fight for the boys.  I wish you luck.\n\nYou'd only be TA if you turn your back on the boys.", ">Would I be the asshole if I just say fuck it and leave?\n\nI think NTA. Consult with a lawyer and have a lawyer lay it out for you. I am extremely doubtful that you will be given custody of the kids. It's been five months, this is probably not going to change. Are you in contact with your kids? \n\n>I feel like I would be an asshole taking her away from her brothers.\n\nIs she seeing them now? \n\n>They were grieving and those people took them from their home.\n\nI agree with you but it doesn't change the situation. If they have a lot of resources, even if the kids say they want to live with you, it might not matter. Since he did pay child support and did have them for a little bit, this doesn't fit under abandonment. \n\nHave you spoken with a lawyer? You need to do that first. You also need to talk to your sons and let them know what the lawyer says. The important part is your sons don't feel you abandoned them. I fully understand wanting to sell your house and go back to your family and why they would want you there. \n\nWhat the grandparents did was awful but how do your kids feel? Do they feel you did something wrong? Do they understand what happened? You can leave and leave it open with them that once they are 18, maybe you could open your house to them or ???", "Absolutely NTA.  I'm so sorry for your loss OP.  The only thing I can think of in this case is to go talk to the grandparents.  Lay it out for them.  Do they want to spend their retirement caring for children?  By now they see their son isn't going to help much.  If they tell you they aren't going to budge then go.  Let the kids know that they will be welcome to find you when they turn 18.", "NTA. That sounds like an impossible situation. \n\nPersonally, I would give it until at least November before you decide your next move. There is a reason that it is common advice to not make major life decisions within the first year after a tragedy.

My brother-in-law was in a similar situation, except the children weren't forcibly removed by their bio dad or family. It actually took very little time because the court asked the kids, and they wanted to stay with step dad. Bio dad had to pay child support in the end. The only reason bio dad  wanted them was for the SS benefits. I would bet that is the reason here also. Each child is entitled to a certain amount until they are 18 because of the loss of a parent", "NTA. I'd tell the boys this is not your choice and all your reasonings. Children grow up and they remember. But tight now it doesn't sound like you have any legal recourse over the biological family unfortunately.
