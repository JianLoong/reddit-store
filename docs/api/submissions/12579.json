If you would like - DM me. I\u2019m great at this type of research. \n\n3/ Look at custody rights for your daughter to stay in her brothers\u2019 lives and vice versa in due time.\n\n4/ For the future I\u2019d imagine you may stay and build a life where you are with visitation for the siblings (and yourself). Or you can move home and the visits be arranged over school holidays - is Illinois travel distance and within budget for you to cover that would be part of the research and planning. Keep in mind when the boys can decide where they\u2019ll live by state/fed laws idk. Maybe eventually they can move to you if things don\u2019t work out with the paternal side. You just need 3 to maintain a relationship meanwhile.\n\nFor now - one step at a time, and no deadline for you - and recognize now is not the time to make major decisions. Take care of yourself first. Wishing you all the best of outcomes and the future", "My heart just broke. I am very sorry for your losses. \nWhat I do not get is, what was child protection service doing? I mean the boys were allready traumatisised by the death of their mother and then they lost their home, their family - the adult they trusted the most. \nIt was not in their interest to be taken out of their home. Where I live, children\u2018s interests are also being eroded, but there\u2018s a law that the interests of the children come before the interests of the adults. Maybe there\u2018s something similar in your state?\nYou need your family too now. I would try to get in contact with the boys, visits should be declared as something that is in the children\u2018s interest. Let them know that you want them. They have rights, they don\u2018t have to be nice and swallow this violation. Being nice is helping the abusers (people who do something cruel like that are abusers).\nSo if they are aware they could try to get other authorities involved, like a school counselor etc. If this people are annoyed and don\u2019t want to work, go a Level higher. Are they on social media? Let them know that you love them. And that they are having a place wherever you are. \nYou need your family too, once you tried to get the boys and it didn\u2019t work out, make sure, that they know where and how to find you and go to your family. Put money aside for a trainticket, something like that. \nIt is a horrible situation, you will need the advice of a good lawyer. Maybe you can get one for the boys? Don\u2018t know if it is possible.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. The best thing I can offer is to keep in contact with them, and like u/SirRabbott said, explain to them exactly who is responsible for them not seeing you.

Perhaps you can tell the grandparents that you want to say goodbye to the boys, so that they give you the chance to speak to them.  Also, you could write them each a heartfelt letter and make sure they know you still care about them.  They lost their mother, and now they are losing the man who has been their father for all this time.\n\nIf the grandparents are that hostile to you, could you make some kind of arrangement with a neighbour that you will write to the boys via them?  You could give them permission to read the letters, to satisfy themselves that you are not doing anything wrong.

If they have a lot of resources, even if the kids say they want to live with you, it might not matter. Since he did pay child support and did have them for a little bit, this doesn't fit under abandonment. \n\nHave you spoken with a lawyer? You need to do that first. You also need to talk to your sons and let them know what the lawyer says. The important part is your sons don't feel you abandoned them. I fully understand wanting to sell your house and go back to your family and why they would want you there. \n\nWhat the grandparents did was awful but how do your kids feel? Do they feel you did something wrong? Do they understand what happened? You can leave and leave it open with them that once they are 18, maybe you could open your house to them or ???", "Absolutely NTA.  I'm so sorry for your loss OP.  The only thing I can think of in this case is to go talk to the grandparents.  Lay it out for them.  Do they want to spend their retirement caring for children?

It's a bad idea to make major decisions like that when you're deep in grief anyway, but in this case you also have to consider how the children would perceive it.

He doesn't care about you, he doesn't even want you in his life!\"  Your daughter will be upset that you're moving so far away from her brothers.

They personally blocked you from getting custody before showing you do want to be a parental figure.\n\n If it's too much to fight though and honestly I see how you can be uncertain because there is no right thing in this situation everyone probably thinks they are doing what's best.

Your older son may want to come live with you when he turns 18, and if you move away too quickly, that option is taken away from him as it would be too hard to finish high school in a different state this late in the game.\n\nPlease don\u2019t give up on them.

You love them, just not enough to fight for them, esp if its gonna cost you anything she left behind (which im sure some of it was meant for her kids, if not all of it).

You act all offended & bent out of shape because they didnt want her to move the kids out of state??

You sound like you are bitter that their father & grandparents want to parent them. You want them, but dont want to spend $ fighting for them.

At the first visit, a lawyer (family practice) should be able to give you a good idea of what your chances are, how long it may take, and an estimate of what it will cost you. The fact that they lived with you and are not permitted to see their sister should be very helpful.\n\nPut off moving until you have a better idea of what you can do.

I misread where the kids were dropped off at Dad's house, picked up by granny and he couldn't speak to them.  My mistake.", "College?", "Depending on the jurisdiction, someone who has been \"in loco parentis\" (acting as a parent) for the boys as long as OP has, and given how integrated they were into the family he and his wife had made, he would have a pretty solid case for guardianship - especially if the boys want to stay with him. But it would be a fight, and he doesn't have a lot of fight in him right now, for very valid reasons. Perhaps the best he can do right now is make sure the boys know he will always be there for them, and will welcome them \"home\" when they turn 18.

Because if that's the case he may want to come back to see his family during breaks. This could be a time for family to reconnect.", "I agree but OP needs to do what's best for him. He can fight all he wants but odds are pretty great things will not go his way in court because the grandparents want the kids. Doesn't matter how shitty their dad is which is unfortunate. Now the courts could award him custody if the boys want to go with him. I personally think the bio dad and grandparents are disgusting. They didn't want the kids til mom died and are now using a technicality to get their way.", "You are right, hopefully there will be some way OP can get word to the boys on where he'll be if they need him if they can't go with him.

Since they are close to legal age perhaps you could meet up with them. Explain the situation but let them know you are always there for them and they are welcome to come to Illinois. You need your family and while they are your family you have no legal rights.", "I am so sorry. For all of you but most especially your children. How cold and cruel for those ppl to keep your sons and daughter apart", "This is beyond a simple NTA/YTA, it's about whether the move and letting the boys go would be justified, which I believe is way more important. And I do think you would be justified to make this move. From what you said, the alternative is burning up your life and money for almost certainly no return, while living somewhere without a support system.", "I have to say don't bother all the cost to pay a lawyer, and you may not even get the kids in the end.", "Question, what has the lawyer told you are your chances?

People who make major decisions when they're in deep grief often regret it.\n\nIf he stays there is at least a chance he could have some visitation with the boys.  And he has to consider his daughter.  She's already lost her mom and her brothers.  How harmful would it be for her to lose her home and her friends as well?\n\nI get that he needs his family.  He can plan trips to visit his family and do some fun things with his daughter.  He can invite his family to come spend time with him.
