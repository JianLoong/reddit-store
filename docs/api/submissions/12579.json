They are great kids and we have always gotten along. They treat me with respect and when their sister was born they treated her like a full sibling. \n\nTheir biological father is a piece of work though. He is a perfect example of a Disney dad. He shows up occasionally, showers his sons with gifts and affection and then is gone for months. \n\nTo be exact he has seen his sons exactly 14 days in the last year. \n\nMy wife and I had to kowtow to his whims though. She had a job opportunity in another state. She couldn't take it though because his parents live here and that's where he \"lives\". \n\nI'm still dealing with what I'm about to talk about so please forgive me if I have trouble articulating my feelings. \n\nMy wife passed away in November in a snowmobile accident and within a week his parents had gone to court to get the boys. \n\nI'm not their legal guardian. My wife and I tried but he wouldn't allow it and his parents were happy to help him fuck with us. \n\nIt was fine when she was here but now it's all screwed up. I can't see them. They are staying with their grandparents. I wish my wife's parents were alive to help me but they aren't. \n\nSo my boys are not in their rooms. They are dropped off and picked up from school by their grandmother. I have no rights to them at all. I have a lawyer but I don't want to spend all my money and time on this.

I want to sell the house and move back to the Illinois. My family is all there and I have no one here. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I just say fuck it and leave? My daughter misses her mom and her brothers. I feel like I would be an asshole taking her away from her brothers. \n\nMy parents and siblings want me back home. I just feel like shit leaving the boys with these people. Their father literally stopped paying child support and had his parents take them the week she died. They were grieving and those people took them from their home. \n\nI want to fight for them but not to exhaust my resources on them.", "created_utc": 1679123120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uh3kb/wibta_for_abandoning_my_stepsons_with_their/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

THe fact that you can type its hard tells me your not an asshole.  Go home take your daughter but do what you can to stay in contact. When there older explain why you had to leave.    Honestly the  Asshole is Disney dad and grandparents .", "NTA for leaving but please keep in contact in some way, if you feel like the kids really have bonded with you. I don't know or believe if the father is actually neglectful enough to warrant major action. I am personally biased, as where I live, it is important for children to remain in a relationship with their biological parents. I also don't know the full extent of the children's feelings. I also would like more information. How old are the children? How long have you known them?", "About your boys, try to keep in contact with them ( video calls etc) until they turn 18.  If going back to your family will help provide support for you at this difficult time, you should.", "I'm so very sorry for your loss, OP. I think this one is beyond reddit. Can you talk with a therapist to help sort through this to decide the best thing to do?", "NTA. \n\nBut it sounds like the boys are teenagers so there is a good chance that the courts would ask them where they want to live and who they want to see. It looks like they are between 14 and 17. Assuming you have a reasonable lawyer who is not overcharging you the fight might not be as tough as you think it is.", "Sorry for your loss. It's probably best for you to go to Illinois for family support. Unfortunately courts usually side with bio parents, you are not abandoning them, only being realistic. This far and away beyond AITA forum.", "Nta. Rather than fighting for custody I think your money would be better supporting the boys with a lawyer for amancipation and having a room for them at your new place closer to your family. They have choices that they can exercise better than you can.", "NTA. 1) I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. 2) You can\u2019t get blood from a stone & if you don\u2019t have the finances then it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cnot wanting to deplete them\u201d- having the house paid off doesn\u2019t mean your daughter won\u2019t have ongoing expenses like education etc. \n\nThat said, if you *can*, speak to a lawyer about what your options are as there may be other options to allow the boys to at least see their sister\u2026 Make sure you take care of yourself, too, OP. You can\u2019t fill a cup from an empty vessel, and you can\u2019t give your daughter or the boys what they need emotionally if you\u2019re neglecting yourself.", "Nta. There's nothing you can do right now, especially if the family is all working against you. I would suggest going home with your daughter, and grieve. \n\n\nThen see what you can do about custody for your daughter's siblings. Maybe ask a close family member to look into legal counsel for you. \n\n\nExplain to the boys very clearly what's going on and which adults are responsible for this, they're old enough to have a right to know what's going on with their futures.\n\nI am so, so incredibly sorry for your loss.", "I am so very sorry for the losses you all have experienced.  I am so very sad for your children, dd and sons.  Leaving those boys BEFORE you get to tell them where your head is would be a huge mistake.  I know you have time to talk to them, so take that time.  I KNOW you don't have the words right now to tell them, but FIND them to tell them you aren't leaving them.  You are fighting for them, but have no rights.  Just make sure you let them know they ARE your kids and you will do ALL you can to be in their lives what ever way you are able/", "NTA.  You need to do what\u2019s best for you.  I would think it would be difficult to fight for somebody when you\u2019re emotionally and mentally drained.  You still have a daughter to raise and kids pick up on their parents emotions easily.  It\u2019s clear this very tragic situation isn\u2019t going to being solved over night.  Your daughter will always be related to those boys, so you have clout there.  Maybe time will give more opportunities to be reunited, and you should prepare yourself as if that will happen.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for losing both your wife and the children you've raised as your own for years. \n\nDo your best to keep in touch with them for everyone's sake. Let them know you're there for them, whether that's at your current place, or having a guest room for them when they turn 18.", "Try to stay if you can, if one of them is 17 even if you can't talk to him now he may be waiting for his 18th birthday to come home but if you're gone he'll have no where to go.", "NTA. Go back to Illinois. Start the healing process. You don\u2019t have to abandon them but you can\u2019t start a fight right now when you\u2019re so drained. Think everything through. Don\u2019t lose touch with them though. Their mom died as well.", "NTA\n\nYou probably aren\u2019t winning this", "I'm so sorry for your loss, OP.   \nI don't think you'd be TA because this is an impossible situation you've ended up in and it's beyond unfair that you don't get to just be with your kids and your family at home and grieve together.\n\nI do agree that if they're teens, the courts will give them a choice and if it's viable, it may be worth trying, especially if being with you and their sister is something the boys want.\n\nAlso, if it's something you can do, perhaps it's also worth seeking out therapy for both you and your daughter, so that you can work through your grief over the loss of your wife and the boy's bio dad making things so much harder. \n\nTake care of yourself and do what you feel is best for you and your kids at this time.", "NTA\n\nI think this is a hard one. I can see why you want to give up, but you owe it to your daughter and your step sons to try and keep their relationship alive and close. Their opinions on the situation will matter to lawyers/ judges etc.", "I know it feels like you don\u2019t have the mental energy to deal with them but all the boys knew as a dad is you. And on top of losing their mom now they are losing their dad and sister. Please go to therapy and get as much help as possible but don\u2019t let all of your children lose their family. All 3 of them are going to be dramatically affected by this and eventually a lot of regrets and resentments will take place. This isn\u2019t the time to have imposter syndrome. You ARE their dad. Maybe not biologically but emotionally. So fight for them. If not for you for your wife\u2019s sake and your daughter\u2019s sake. I know you have no mental tokens right now but don\u2019t make major life decisions that completely change your life around while mourning. Stay put until you process things. It\u2019s too much for kids to both lose a parent and their stability.", "Therapist time. Talk with the boys. Talk with the GP. This is so tough. I'm so sorry for what you are going through.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
