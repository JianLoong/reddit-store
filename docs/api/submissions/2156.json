I\u2019ve been told in high school that I would be pretty attractive if I payed more attention to appearance, hit the gym, and dressed fashionably since I\u2019m fairly tall (6\u20190), and have nice facial features and hair and am naturally slim with broad shoulders (this is relevant, I\u2019m not just bragging). I always thought it would be cool to be able to be more attractive but I focused more on school. \n\nWhen I came to college, one of the first friends I made was a guy on my floor. Despite being on the shorter side (I think 5\u20194-5\u20195) and self proclaimedly average looking, he was seen as attractive to a lot of girls. The reason for that seemed to be that since his height and face were out of his control, he made sure everything that was in his control appearance wise was impeccable\u2014 he dressed very well, had really nice long hair, went to the gym religiously, etc. So he was no longer just short with an average face, he was the guy with luscious hair and abs and cool clothes/pretty earrings. This evidently worked as a lot of girls were into him. \n\nI was inspired by this, and I started hitting the gym, letting my hair grow out, buying nicer clothes, and getting my ears pierced/nice pearl stud earrings. It\u2019s only been give or take 3 months, but I do look a lot better with longer hair/nicer clothes, and I\u2019ve been seeing a decent amount of gym gains. Consequently, I\u2019ve been noticing lots more girls being attracted to me than ever before.\n\nThis annoyed my friend, though, and he confronted me. He said he busted his ass for years to get a nice body, perfect his style, and so on because he didn\u2019t have the natural advantages I had, so it was fucked up of me to spend a few months at the gym, buy some decent clothes, etc, and suddenly become more attractive than him. \n\nI see where he\u2019s coming from\u2014 he puts years of effort to overcome natural disadvantages and here comes somebody that has advantages over him he can\u2019t overcome, so if they take their natural advantages and add everything he did to make himself attractive, there\u2019s no way for him to compete. \n\nAt the same time, I don\u2019t think he has a monopoly on going to the gym or dressing nice. Plus, it\u2019s a campus with tens of thousands of people, theres plenty of girls still out there that will find him attractive.", "created_utc": 1668288150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytiquj/aita_for_stealing_everything_that_makes_my_friend/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But he doesn\u2019t own working out or taking care of your hair or buying nice clothes.  A bunch of people do that.\n\nWhat this is coming down to is his insecurity and jealousy.  It sounds like what\u2019s happening is that he\u2019s insecure about his height and looks, and the way he found to cope with that was by taking control of what he could, which, cool.  I\u2019d also wager a guess that he boosted his own ego with some sort of narrative like, \u201cI may not be X and Y like OP, but at least I can pull ladies because I do these things he doesn\u2019t\u201d.  Now you have the attributes he was already insecure about not having, and you\u2019ve added the things he felt set him apart.

I get the frustration with being short and having taller friends as well as the struggles of hearing how women think you're too short since I'm a short guy too. It's a preference people have and people are allowed to have preferences. It's also not something you can change and that's just the way life works. \n\nHe feels envious and insecure since he probably feels like you're showing him up, and that's okay since emotions are irrational and can't be helped.

It would suck to have an innate ceiling on something so societally valued due to factors out of your hands, work hard to maximize what you have, and have somebody show you up with a lot less work just because they happened to get luckier genetically. I just don\u2019t think lashing out at me is fair though, because my genetics are just as random as his", "I think in his case it was more just an outburst of insecurity than something more calculated. Although I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA, I do understand his frustration\u2014 when there\u2019s a ceiling on how good you can be at something, especially something so socially pervasive as attractiveness, and you work the hardest with what you can, seeing somebody that just is more blessed than you are surpass years of work in months can be really frustrating. In his own words, he can\u2019t compete with a \u2018kpop looking mf\u2019 (me) after I put in a few months of work compared to his years. I\u2019d be frustrated i\u2019m his situation too, but I think what makes him TA is that he\u2019s blaming me when I don\u2019t see it as anybody\u2019s fault, just bad luck on his part.", "Yes, nothing he did was particularly unique", "Yeah, I just feel bad for him because I understand his insecurities", "Yeah, I understand his frustration though. Just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for him to have lashed out at me about it", "I do feel bad because it would be very frustrating to have an innate ceiling on how attractive you are due to stuff outside your control (genetics), work hard for years to maximize potential within that ceiling, and have somebody show you up with much less effort. So I will tell him", "From his perspective, I understand his outburst. He was unlucky with genetics and that put an inherent ceiling on how attractive he could be, and instead of being bitter decided to make the best of what he got, only to be blown out of the water by somebody who put in a lot less effort for a lot less time simply because they got lucky. I feel bad but at the end of the day, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault whose genetics are better, the only thing in our control is how we deal with what we have", "yeah. too bad, it was a good friendship while it lasted", "I understand his insecurities so I want to show him a bit more compassion than that", "Thank you", "The way I see him is, he has an innate ceiling on how attractive he could be due to genetics which is totally out of his control. Instead of being bitter, he decided to maximize what he could control to be attractive. Then somebody blows him out of the water with a lot less effort simply because their genetics are luckier. I understand his frustration in feeling his efforts are for nothing. \n\nI do think blaming me is a dick move because my genetics are as random as his are. Plus he\u2019s not even ugly. He\u2019s an average looking guy with cool style that still manages to attract lots of girls.", "What did I do here that\u2019s considered immature?", "I wouldn\u2019t say so. It\u2019s less so I copied his style and more so I was just inspired to start dressing well. By all accounts his style is still a lot better than mine\u2014 I just crib off kpop idols since he said I look like a \u2018kpop mf\u2019 while he has actual unique style", "What did I do that\u2019s immature here?", "how would you know if I am or not without ever having seen me?", "why so?", "Yea, exactly. Everyone has a certain limit to how far they can go with looks. He hit his, but to blame, u is uncalled for. I'd say keep ur distance because u never know how far jealousy will go. Never underestimate another person's jealousy.", "I'm a 5 foot tall dude, shorter than him, and not masculine in the slightest, people think I look like a pretty girl. I also have long hair and a sense of fashion. I can understand wanting luckier genetics, but you have to work with what you have and not pull others down just because they have something you don't. \n\nYour friend needs to get over it. If he's that insecure, I can't see him keeping the women he attracts. Insecurity is one of the biggest disadvantages to have. There are very few traits that are uglier than insecurity and a sense of entitlement to how others are allowed to exist.\n\nYes, being tall is an advantage, but not on its own. Being tall only means something if you're attractive. Muscle is attractive.  \n\nThere is no \"competition\" since women's attention can't be owned, only drawn. If there is a completion, you are competing with a woman's solitude, not with other guys. \n\nAnd if a woman only likes tall attractive guys with long hair? Then he never had a chance anyway. \n\nIt's not like you're stealing his clothing or hair conditioner. You are just refining the traits you already possess. What property did you take from him that rightfully belongs to him? Nothing. You took nothing from him that is property of him.", "He has no reason to be frustrated either. Nothing you\u2019re doing is about him. You\u2019re not trying to be him, you\u2019re making adult decisions to better yourself.", "I think he would really appreciate that. It\u2019s definitely nice to have people recognize how hard you work.", "You sound nice.This happens in many other aspects of life as well WRT peoples innate talents and abilities or positions in life which may cause you to be jealous. Remember learn from this as you can only control yourself, the environment (to a certain extent), and the people around you.  Keep improving yourself and stay humble.", "Well, good luck with that.", "I think it's copying his style. Right now, you just seem like a taller version of him. It's important to develop your own and not just copy someone.", "Okay but try to put yourself in his shoes, especially with growing your hair out, like his, getting earrings, like him. Sounds similar, if not copying him. Maybe just talk to him that you aren\u2019t trying to copy him, but liked his style and was inspired to start paying more attention to your looks.", "That\u2019s true. I do feel he\u2019s truly a good guy, or at least hope he is, whose insecurities got the best of him.", "From his perspective it would suck. He had an innate ceiling on how attractive he can be due to genetics factors out of his control. He worked hard to maximize what he has, and somebody showed him up in a few months simply because their genetics are \u2018better\u2019 than his, and there\u2019s no way he can change that and just has to sit and watch somebody surpass him due to his own bad luck. I truly have sympathy for that. But at the same time I don\u2019t see blaming me as right\u2014 I\u2019m not in control of my genetics any more than he is", "Thank you for your advice", "Thanks", "I didn\u2019t copy his style. I was inspired by the fact he dressed well yo start dressing well myself, but our actual styles are pretty different\u2014 he wears lots of colors, I wear mostly black, he wears more loose fitting silhouettes, etc. His style inspo is more like streetwear type fits while mine is fairly generic preppy ish fits", "That\u2019s fair. My hair is a totally different style than him and really those aren\u2019t too uncommon things to do but I do get that he might feel that way. I\u2019ll talk to him", "Yea. Good luck on everything.", "Then I guess he is truly just frustrated.", "thank you", "Yeah, I feel bad", "It's unfortunate for him, but it is what it is. No one can change that. It hurts but... as people grow up they learn to deal with it", "That\u2019s true.", "Also, different styles attract different people.\n\nI have a friend of mine who will not date anyone over 5'11 and she like a certain style. While others are the opposite. Plenty of fish, just different nets", "Yeah, of course. There are plenty of girls that would like more of a colorful streetwear style like he wears as opposed to the more generic formalwear/preppy stuff I wear", "ESH.\n\nMy friend copied my style for years and it was annoying. I wish people would just find their own personalities. But also, I do understand fashion inspiration. If you do it excessively then it\u2019s more weird than anything though lol.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou could have been inspired by him without copying him. What happens when styles change? Who will you copy then? Maybe you can figure out your own style. That's pretty attractive.", "Just a comment - I think one of the things that makes dressing well and putting effort into your appearance attractive is that it's a signal you're not a slob, and a girlfriend won't have to do your laundry or make sure you're dressed appropriately for different social events etc etc. It's less work to have an independent adult man!"]}
