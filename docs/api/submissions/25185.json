If the parents didn't make the kid stop, then I would address it with them.  Your kid may not understand why she isn't allowed to do something, but you as the parent do understand the concept of boundaries and property.  I'm in agreement with you; kids (or anyone) shouldn't touch someone else's property without their permission", "NTA--- You are teaching your child a boundary which is perfectly normal!!", "NAH. However, this isn\u2019t a behaviour restricted to autism (although I\u2019m sure her autism effects how she engages in it), your wife is right in saying that kids sometimes just want to touch things! It\u2019s absolutely justified to want to teach them not to.\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t want to be sending your daughter mixed messages, so it\u2019s up to you and your wife to come up with a compromise you both agree on (e.g., when possible, taking her to your own vehicle when she wants to do this; providing her with an alternative object for tactile stimulation, etc).\n\nThe two of you responding in a consistent, rather than conflicting, manner may help reduce the severity of the meltdowns as well.", "NTA. Thank you for teaching your daughter to respect other peoples property!", "NTA - You teach kids, any kids, not to touch other people's property no matter what.  And oh BTW you can definitely damage some cars (vintage/show) by just touching them so Mom is wrong here.", "Yikes! I let my toddler touch cars, and this thread is informing me that most people aren\u2019t down with that. Looks like I\u2019ve got an uncomfortable conversation coming up.", "NTA, you're teaching her the appropriate behaviour you would like her to display when she's older just the same as you would if she wasn't autistic.", "NTA - this is. good parenting", "Nta, sure, she isn't damaging anything now, but what happens if she starts banging, hitting, and kicking other people's property? It may slowly progress, and if you tell her it's fine now, it's harder to tell her it isn't later, and eventually, she may start damaging cars. What's her mother's plan then?", "NTA - I think you are doing what is right. Dirt damages the paint when touched, even if we can\u2019t see it with our own eyes. Makes the protection of clear coat down to nothing.", "Nta, the no thing is kinda true tho, just say I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not ours but you can pet my car (or grandmas or whomever)  nice/gentle.it shows her the difference between ours/hers and other peoples. I do this with my toddler and I swear she gets it more if I say do this instead rather than no.", "NTA. Beyond the potential for damaging others property it can be a safety thing. \n\nI had my motorcycle parked out in front of a gas station for 5 minutes when I ran into grab a drink. I came out to a kid trying to clamber onto my motorcycle from the opposite direction of the kick stand and it was wobbling.

As someone who takes pride in their car, I can say the mystery scratches that show up over the years are quite frustrating, and many of these were likely quite innocent, like a child touching car (with a toy, zipper, whatever). That said, I don\u2019t know how healthy a child leash is, only that in some situations (for some folks) they are very practical", "INFO: When your daughter touches a car, is she gentle? or is it typical toddler palm smacking?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Context is important, and you wanna teach your child there isn't something wrong with *her*, just that respecting personal space/property is important.\n\nI imagine that's probably what is bothering her mom, when you spread it all out.

It's become a new development", "NTA - It is important to teach boundaries regarding other people's things.\n\nWith that said, if she is gentle, I can understand mom's pov as a pick your battles. Parenting a toddler is exhausting on its own, before adding in special needs.\n\nI would be curious to try to figure out her attraction to cars.  (is she seeing her reflection? just likes shiny things? likes the feel of the warm/cold metal? etc.)\n\n If you were able to figure out what type of stimulation she's getting out of seeing & touching cars, you may be able to find an alternative for her to fulfil her desire while also respecting boundaries."]}
