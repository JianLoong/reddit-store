If the parents didn't make the kid stop, then I would address it with them.  Your kid may not understand why she isn't allowed to do something, but you as the parent do understand the concept of boundaries and property.  I'm in agreement with you; kids (or anyone) shouldn't touch someone else's property without their permission", "NTA--- You are teaching your child a boundary which is perfectly normal!!", "NAH. However, this isn\u2019t a behaviour restricted to autism (although I\u2019m sure her autism effects how she engages in it), your wife is right in saying that kids sometimes just want to touch things! It\u2019s absolutely justified to want to teach them not to.\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t want to be sending your daughter mixed messages, so it\u2019s up to you and your wife to come up with a compromise you both agree on (e.g., when possible, taking her to your own vehicle when she wants to do this; providing her with an alternative object for tactile stimulation, etc).\n\nThe two of you responding in a consistent, rather than conflicting, manner may help reduce the severity of the meltdowns as well.", "NTA. Thank you for teaching your daughter to respect other peoples property!", "NTA - You teach kids, any kids, not to touch other people's property no matter what.  And oh BTW you can definitely damage some cars (vintage/show) by just touching them so Mom is wrong here.", "Yikes! I let my toddler touch cars, and this thread is informing me that most people aren\u2019t down with that. Looks like I\u2019ve got an uncomfortable conversation coming up.", "NTA, you're teaching her the appropriate behaviour you would like her to display when she's older just the same as you would if she wasn't autistic.", "NTA - this is. good parenting", "Nta, sure, she isn't damaging anything now, but what happens if she starts banging, hitting, and kicking other people's property? It may slowly progress, and if you tell her it's fine now, it's harder to tell her it isn't later, and eventually, she may start damaging cars. What's her mother's plan then?", "NTA - I think you are doing what is right. Dirt damages the paint when touched, even if we can\u2019t see it with our own eyes. Makes the protection of clear coat down to nothing.", "Nta, the no thing is kinda true tho, just say I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not ours but you can pet my car (or grandmas or whomever)  nice/gentle.it shows her the difference between ours/hers and other peoples. I do this with my toddler and I swear she gets it more if I say do this instead rather than no.", "NTA. Beyond the potential for damaging others property it can be a safety thing. \n\nI had my motorcycle parked out in front of a gas station for 5 minutes when I ran into grab a drink. I came out to a kid trying to clamber onto my motorcycle from the opposite direction of the kick stand and it was wobbling.

As someone who takes pride in their car, I can say the mystery scratches that show up over the years are quite frustrating, and many of these were likely quite innocent, like a child touching car (with a toy, zipper, whatever). That said, I don\u2019t know how healthy a child leash is, only that in some situations (for some folks) they are very practical", "INFO: When your daughter touches a car, is she gentle? or is it typical toddler palm smacking?\n\n\nWtf? Can't ask for more info without a downvote army?\n\nI answered NTA like most everyone else, but given the child's age and autism I think fully understanding the behavior is important.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Context is important, and you wanna teach your child there isn't something wrong with *her*, just that respecting personal space/property is important.\n\nI imagine that's probably what is bothering her mom, when you spread it all out. Its a lot of constant pressure for the kid, and she should be able to let it out as long as she's not hurting anyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s still other people\u2019s stuff and allowing it for one thing but not another will just be confusing.", "This!  Here\u2019s an idea.

It's become a new development", "NTA - It is important to teach boundaries regarding other people's things.\n\nWith that said, if she is gentle, I can understand mom's pov as a pick your battles. Parenting a toddler is exhausting on its own, before adding in special needs.\n\nI would be curious to try to figure out her attraction to cars.  (is she seeing her reflection? just likes shiny things? likes the feel of the warm/cold metal? etc.)\n\n If you were able to figure out what type of stimulation she's getting out of seeing & touching cars, you may be able to find an alternative for her to fulfil her desire while also respecting boundaries.", "NTA - I always remind my kids to not touch other people\u2019s cars or property. It\u2019s teaching them respect for other people\u2019s stuff.", "NTA her approach is just lazy parenting. many parents forget that they\u2019re raising future adults. We shouldn\u2019t go around touching people\u2019s things.", "NTA. If your child accidentally broke something off of a car you will be responsible for getting it fixed. Better to teach your child to keep their hands to themselves.", "NTA, I have worked with plenty of children with autism, if you leave it and let her do it whenever she feels like it will a hundred times harder to break the habit and the resulting kick off will be worse than ever.  I would suggest not saying only no, maybe when you get to your car (made up name as you don\u2018t mention one)  \u2018lilah\u2019s car while touching it with her\u2019 and when she goes to touch someone else's block her hand and say \u2018not lilah\u2019s car, no touching\u2019. Could even do this with a family friends car so she begins to understand. Could even do it as an adult, touch your car saying \u2018daddy\u2019s car\u2019 the Pretend to go touch someone else\u2019s car and then act as though remembering pull hand away and say \u2019not daddy\u2019s car, no touching.\u2019", "\"She also says just telling her \"no\" all the time will just make her want to do it more.\u201d She isnt wrong but its not a good thing to do. NTA. If you say yes, she will probably also take other peoples stuff or think its now okay.", "You're NTA, but let me give you a piece of unsolicited advice.\n\nKids that age, including autistic kids, have trouble with \"no\". Not because it's emotionally upsetting, but because in order to comprehend \"Don't touch the car\" they first have to think \"touch the car\", and then they do it because they thought it. \n\nIf you want better results, it's better to tell your child to do something than to tell her *not* to do something. Instead of seeing her go for a car and then saying \"No, don't touch the car, that's not yours\" you're more likely to get through the walk without a fuss if you a. start off by saying \"Okay, now we're going to hold hands while we walk to the store!\" and then b. if she heads towards a car or something saying \"Oh, but we're still holding hands! Gotta keep holding hands!\" and then perhaps occasionally, at the end, saying \"Wow, we did a great job holding hands the whole way!\" with a treat. The key word there is *occasionally* - intermittent reinforcement is always the way to go.\n\nIt doesn't have to be \"holding hands\", it just has to be something your daughter will more-or-less willingly do that she *can't* do if she's going to lean on a car - carrying a big toy in both hands, blowing bubbles if she has that coordination, pushing something in front of her - anything that keeps her occupied.", "I wouldn\u2019t want a strange kid touching my car. She can go from touching to damaging in 0.3 seconds and you can\u2019t control it. It can pay for it. Is that what your wife wants? Or for your daughter to have a heart attack when she touches a car and an alarm starts blaring? NTA, and keep saying no. She needs to learn that she won\u2019t always get an explanation when being told no.", "NTA. When I was a kid, I never climbed on people\u2019s cars. My parents were very clear on what things were expensive and why I shouldn\u2019t be climbing on things that don\u2019t belong to me. Her mother sounds terrible. Just wait for your daughter to break someone\u2019s headlight or something and her mother will be thinking it\u2019s no big deal", "NTA what happens when she gets a finger or a sleeve caught, or knocks something over? What about running up to a car to touch it and the driver doesn\u2019t notice? I\u2019d think these are worst case scenarios, but accidents can happen to even great parents.", "I heard of people getting burned from touching motorbikes, so that's also a big nope.", "NTA. maybe another way of explaining to your daughter to not touch other peoples things is to ask her how she'd feel if someone touched hers. Most people with ASD HATE other people touching their things (myself included)", "NTA. She shouldn't be touching someone else's property. She doesn't own it, y'all don't own it, she can learn to respect boundaries, it just may be harder for her.", "Nta.\n\nShe doesn't need to touch cars. They can be boiling hot. She's still little, so curiosity is natural, but giving her guidelines by saying no or don't touch, is perfectly fine. Give her a sensory toy instead.", "Exhaust pipes are hot yo", "If she were a little older I'd suggest you see if there's a Touch-a-Truck event in your area - but that requires a certain degree of understanding that most two year olds don't have, and they're also *very noisy*, which of course many autistic kids can't handle. (There's a reason I never brought the kids to Touch-a-Truck myself! I am one of those autistic people who really doesn't like loud noises. I found the events and then asked somebody else to bring them, lol!)"]}
