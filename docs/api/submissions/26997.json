It is true, OP's parents may have failed in parenting, but there is no reason to take it out on a child. Autistic people who have melt-downs are not in control. The solution isn't yelling back and saying hurtful things.", "Im not shes an abusive bully", "Yes, I have. I'm not justifying OP's cruelty with her words and lashing out to a child, regardless of the 11 year old being authistic or not, that was uncalled for and should have never happened, but I'm trying to see the bigger picture and judge the entire situation: clearly OP lashed out because she has been dealing with this since she was 13, the parents placing the youngest healthy conditioned child before her, spoiling him and letting him act and treat anyone as he pleases, and this incident was the last straw that broke the chemel's back. She lashed out because she has been dealing with this situation for 11 fricking years and the parents do absolutely nothing to help the child or educate him and support his behaviour.\n\nNo, I'm not supporting OP's actions, the parents DID deserve the screaming, not the kid, but I am not going to pretend like the kid was entirely innocent on this: he screamed at OP demanding her phone despite having one himself, a phone being one of the most private objects we currently have, and when she said no, he screamed further, snatched the phone and broke it on purpose. The kid didn't deserve the screaming he got, but the parents SHOULD have scolded him and not letting him treat his big sister like that, and instead of even trying to educate him, they immediately sided with him, again, after he purposefully stole his sister's phone and broke it. The parents have clearly been tolerating this behaviour and are not improving.", "Ok bozo, come back when you know how life works.", "Not her saying that after 11 years of potential issues the screaming for something the brother already has, breaking of the phone and also narcissistic behaviour.", "Ok have fun supporting child abuse", "Think we found the 11yo.", "Found the child's account."]}
