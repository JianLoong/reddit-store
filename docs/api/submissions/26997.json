If OP can\u2019t handle it, she needs to stay away. Screaming at the kid and saying genuinely awful things to him does nothing but make her look bad.", "Yes, normal. By the literal definition of the word. I\u2019m autistic and definitely see myself as not-normal.\nDo your white-knighting for a group that needs it", "How am I projecting? So what do you suggest we do? The unreliable narrator is the only source of information we have. Again, I'm not supporting OP's behaviour, but I can understand the situation is terrible. The kid has no respect for boundaries or other people and it shows. No 11 year old kid would behave like that with or without autism, meaning this kid has behaved like this before, and for what the narrator told us, he wasn't scolded, meaning they enable this behaviour.", "I HAVE met a child with autism. No, wait, I lied, I met CHILDREN with autism, thank you very much.", "It\u2019s not just a child. It\u2019s her brother! Y\u2019all never been assholes to your own brother or sister?? I mean\u2026 If I broke my brothers phone I would have to run for my life. Being disabled is not a free pass for spoiled behaviour.", "No, they be right, we are normal even tho we're autistic. We are diaabled, not aliens.", "I'm not white knighting, I'm autistic and take issue with the idea that that makes me inherently abnormal. If that's how you want to identify then go for it, but don't be surprised if other autistic people take issue when you impose it on us too.", "Are you the spokesperson of autistic people? Speak for yourself."]}
