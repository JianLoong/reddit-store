Recently they began reaching out to me (38F) offering to assist with my 3 kids and saying they want to pick them up from school, they take the bus currently, and drive them to soccer, dance, and their various other activities to take the load off me.\n\nI have been saying no which is upsetting them, but the problem is I have 38 years of experience with them being extremely late or just forgetting to pick me up. I am an only child and have years of memories of sitting outside of buildings waiting wondering when or if they were gonna show.  If I could find a phone I would call an aunt or uncle and eventually someone would arrive. This happened my entire life I remember being 5 and sitting waiting, teachers or coaches calling them over and over.  I remember being 14 sitting at a friend's house until 2am calling them over and over and them not arriving, they were supposed to be there to get me at 7. And I walked to the friend's house as the building I was in was locked and it was the closest place to get to a phone to call them.\n\nThey were not bad parents and they loved me they were just really really unreliable. Neither of them have a cell phone  so if they are not at home you cannot reach them.\n\nI have allowed them to pick up my oldest kids before and more then once me or my husband had to leave work because  school got out 30 minutes ago and they were no where to be seen after they asked to pick them up from school. \n\nThey are stating now that they're retired they won't forget but I just don't believe them. I don't think working had anything to do with it, I just think they get distracted with other things. They are constantly promising my kids they are going to come see their games and they never show up as it is.\n\n My kids have never had to wait or wonder where I am. My husband is aware of my issues with this and knows why and like me ensures he is always there waiting when they walk out of a building. If they are expecting us to be there we are there. Now my family is upset with me because I won't let them take the kids places. I have been honest with them why, but they claim I am living in the past and need to let it go. They tell people that I don't trust anyone and claim I am overprotective of my kids and trying to restrict their access. They are welcome to come visit but honestly they never do.\nAITA for not giving them another chance to prove they are gonna show up and can be trusted?", "created_utc": 1689543216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151ic0g/aita_for_not_allowing_parents_to_pick_up_my_kids/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have been honest and as polite as possible but they keep pushing and sending me tearful messages about how much they love them and just want to be in their life.

They may have good intentions, but they\u2019ve proven to be untrustworthy", "NTA\n\nIt always blows my mind when people get upset that you have learned to expect certain behaviours from them, because they have proven over, and over again that the majority of the time, that is what they will do.\n\nLike I'm sorry, but no you don't get to be angry that I expect you to do something you have continuously shown me is your standard behaviour. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta. They've had plenty of opportunity to show change and they haven't. If they really want to spend time, they can come visit.", "NTA. Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It's tough when you've had experiences like that with your parents. It's natural to be cautious and want to protect your kids from any potential disappointment or inconvenience. You're just being a responsible parent, making sure your kids are always taken care of. Your parents may say they won't forget now that they're retired, but it's hard to shake those memories. Trust takes time to rebuild. Stick to your gut and keep doing what's best for your kids.", "What is bothering you about this?\n\nYou know you are NTA. You know you are protecting your children. Your husband and your children know that they are not reliable.\n\nAre you bothered because they promise they've changed? Point out they have over 30 years of unreliable behavior backing up your decision to not have this done to your children.\n\nAre you bothered that other people believe them?  Point out to family/friends that their claim of you living in the past only goes back 2 months to the last time they were to pick up your children, that you (or husband) were the one to leave work to get your kids when school/whatever called you.\n\nWhen they weep over the phone that you're keeping your kids away from them, ask them where were they last weekend when they swore they were going to visit.\n\nWhy is this even a concern for you? Tell them to stop sending messages about how awful you are or you will block them. Then block them.\n\nETA: As your children get older, more responsible and more mature, then allow them to make decision about this. After you get them a phone to communicate with grandparents. After a few times of this, your parents will be moaning that their grandchildren don't want to be around them.", "NTA your parents are flakes. And I\u2019m sorry, but the extent to which they did it to you from a young age to adult hood, makes them bad parents. It is scary and hurtful for kids to be treated left wondering if they\u2019ve been abandoned or their parent is hurt or feeling that they matter so little that their own parents don\u2019t even care to think about where they are - at 2 am!!!  It would be pretty messed up for you to put your kids through the same thing when they\u2019ve already shown they haven\u2019t changed.", "NTA\n\nBecause you experienced it personally multiple times and know how it affected you, it is natural to not want your kids to feel the same. They may have good intentions, but are just unable to understand what it was like to be forgotten about.", "NTA. You have learned from your experience. And these are your kids, so you do what's right for you and for them. \n\nTell your parents they're welcome to show up and watch your kids' activities also, but that the children will be arriving and departing with you &/or your husband. If they say they will join you, it'll be interesting to track how many times they show up at all, and how frequently they're on time.", "NTA. They are unreliable and have demonstrated so time and again. You\u2019re not living in the past: they forgot you as a kid and have forgotten the grand kids more than once. At the very least, going forward, they each need to get a mobile phone, and use them. Once they get the hang of them, maybe test the waters.", "NTA.\n\nThere is no excuse for being unreliable, and it's unpardonable to do that to helpless kids.\n\nAnd I promise you that if they were fined significantly every time they were late, they would immediately become very punctual.\n\nAnd why would they suddenly become reliable now? Why do they even want to do this in the first place? It's as chore, not an entertainment.", "But they were bad parents. NTA", "NTA and I would never let them take them unless they had cell phones and knew how to use them.", "Oof. Honey, these are NOT good parents. They took away your sense of security your whole life! Don\u2019t let them be alone with your kids, and don\u2019t let them bully you into forgetting the past just like they forgot you. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA - I was the last one picked up from camp in 1979 (age 8) and it still annoys me. It's a horrible feeling as a kid to be sitting there waiting and getting stressed. I make it a point to never let my kids feel that untethered. \n\nDo not agree to this. Ugh.", "NTA. They wouldn't be doing you a favor since you would be (justifiably) worried the whole time that they forgot and wouldn't be free to do something else.", "NTA. They\u2019re unreliable. It\u2019s up to them to prove otherwise.", "NTA.  If they really wanted to gain your trust, they could easily start by showing up to those events themselves, on time, that they say they want to take your kids to.  On their own initiative.", "NTA. My mum wasn\u2019t able to pick me up just once when I was 7 (because of work) and I cried so hard I still remember it decades later. I once also had to walk 3 miles home next to the highway barefoot because the daycare forgot to pick me up and my shoes broke. Stuff like this can give kids trust issues and you\u2019re right to stand your ground.", "NTA.  Your first priority is your children.  No one has the right to unfettered access to your children.  But you\u2019re not even restricting access.  They\u2019re obviously welcome to come see them. They\u2019re simply too scatterbrained to remember to do that.  \n\nI\u2019m sure your children are aware of how unreliable your parents are.  Even if you were inclined to give them another chance (and you are totally justified in not wanting to), I would first discuss this with your children.  Giving them an opportunity to have a say in this is completely reasonable.  They probably do not want to risk being late to their activities.  If they say no, then it\u2019s no.  I\u2019d take the heat for my children if they didn\u2019t want to change the status quo.  \n\nIf you did consider it, I\u2019d make them prove their reliability by consistently showing up for games, recitals, etc. before I\u2019d even consider entrusting them with picking your kids up to get them somewhere on time.  \n\nBut you are not required to allow them to prove themselves by risking a negative impact on your children\u2019s lives by forgetting.  Trust has to be earned and they haven\u2019t demonstrated they can be trusted to follow through. \n\nTell the family that you have given them chances to show up.  They don\u2019t. And you\u2019re not required to constantly subject your children to broken promises.  This is not overprotective micromanagement.  This is choosing to not be a part of inflicting any more hurt.  \n\nThe nice thing about smart phones? Most allow you to delete voice messages without listening to them. The minute you hear what is sure to be a tearful recrimination\u2026delete.  The return text\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve already made clear what their activity dates are.  You are welcome to attend.\u201d", "NTA at all.its really horrible that you had to experience that growing up..\n\nHowever, in the effort of peace, could you offer an olive branch in the form of, 'if you come to watch child's activity consistently for X amount of time, and you get mobile phones, I would consider allowing you to pick them up'.\nIf they follow through with that (which from your post sounds unlikely but might happen) then you could set a time for them to pick up your child that is X minutes before the bus they'd usually get, would come. That way if they don't show, your child won't miss out as they'd still have time to get the bus and if they ever don't show, you can just go back to the first thing about them consistently turning up to watch but increase the length of time they have to prove it for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
