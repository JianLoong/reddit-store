Just staying one night. We invited our fianc\u00e9\u2018s (both m27)\n\nThe agreement was that my friend Jill would book the Airbnb and all of that, and at the end of the trip my fianc\u00e9 and I will send her all of the money involved in our portion of the trip. My fianc\u00e9 and myself didn\u2019t mind this, since we both know she is very particular about planning\n\nThe first day of the trip we were all going to drive directly to the beach, then head to the Airbnb later on to check in\n\nFor some context Jill has some sort of mental disorder. We don\u2019t know what it is, but the second she is upset about anything she will throw a giant tantrum until she gets her way. So imagine my surprise when I\u2019m enjoying the day at the beach, turn around, and there is Jill shouting at her fianc\u00e9\u2019s face\n\nAfter calming her down she finally told us what made her react that way. She saw him looking at another woman\n\nAfter all talking it out we decided it would be best if they talked things out privately. They went back to the AirBnB while my fianc\u00e9 and I stayed at the beach waiting for them to text or call to come join them(which was our agreement). We waited until about 7pm(4hours after they left)before calling them ourselves. Jill picked up and said \u201cWHAT?\u201d we asked if we could come back to the airBnB and she hung up on me. We called her fianc\u00e9, he picked up after a few minutes of calling and apologized, letting us know he didn\u2019t think heading back there would be the best idea\n\nWe got a hotel for the night. We called back in the morning to ask if we were still on for our other activities, they needed up going back home\n\nMy friend sent me a zelle request for half of the AirBnB price this morning. I reminded her my fianc\u00e9 and I never even got to step foot into it. Her argument was since we agreed to pay half of it before hand it doesn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t stay in it, because she only agree on the basis she would pay half it it, not all. I disagree, I\u2019m not paying a few hundred for something I didn\u2019t even get to use! On top of what we payed for our own hotel? No\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 agrees with me that we don\u2019t owe her anything, but he thinks we should just pay the money to get over it. I would normally agree, but I don\u2019t want this to be a gateway.
