I (20f) & my mom have moved in with my cousin (25f) about 6 months ago here in Georgia. We initially decided to move to the state due to all the hardship me & my mom faced in last. My family gracefully let us stay with them rent free while my mom & I saved to buy own place. My mom lives in their RV & my cousin allowed me to stay in her room. We share her bed & she lets me use her stuff. I truly do appreciate all that\u2019s she done for me but here\u2019s the problem. When she gets up in the morning she always turns off the fan & when I brought up the topic & asked her to leave the fan on she told me she was sorry but had to turn it off because the cold keeps her tired but turns it back on when she leaves. The second problem is that she gets ready for work/school in the room & she\u2019s really loud, while I am trying to sleep. & by loud I mean I can hear all the drawers she opens, she\u2019s always putting on dry shampoo & just makes a lot of noise. (Luckily she keeps the lights off) if your wondering what I do for work , I work 1-4 days a week babysitting for locals. anyways I couldn\u2019t handle the ruckus & last night I asked her if she can start getting ready in the bathroom or maybe start sleeping in the living room the days she works since she takes up half the bed. I told her how loud she was & was tired of waking up from her. She also always leaves her room such a mess & doesn\u2019t clean it until a couple of days later. After I told her about the noise she apologized but said she needed her room & will attempt to quiet. I tried coming up with solutions with her but she called me an A-hole for telling her what to do. She started complaining how her life has changed to since I\u2019ve moved in but I had to remind her at least she had a room, I am homeless. I do not feel like an A-hole for wanting to sleep in the mornings but AITAH??", "created_utc": 1684072700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hcyfw/aitah_for_telling_my_cousin_to_start_getting/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't you sleep in the living room?", "Yta. It seems like you're sharing her bed too? And you actually suggested SHE sleep in the living room!!! Invest in ear plugs so she wont wake you.", "YTA - she is letting you live with her to stop you from being homeless.

You\u2019re already *in her bed* and using her things. \n\nIf *you* have a problem you should be the one sleeping on the couch.", "Yta, she is letting you stay and use her things for free so you should be a gracious guest. I'm sure you could sleep on the floor or in the RV too if her getting ready in her room is such a big deal to you.", "YTA You're not paying the rent/mortgage, and you have the audacity to think that you can tell your cousin what she can and can't do in her own home? How entitled are you?

This is the most ungrateful post I\u2019ve seen in a long theme. If you were my cousin you\u2019d be out on your ass before your entitled words left your mouth. \n\n>but I had to remind her at least she had a room, I am homeless\n\nThats 100% your problem.

Don\u2019t burn bridges.", "How do you have such little self awareness to think you might possibly be justified in your unreasonable demands?

Why don't you go sleep in the living room?\nEntitled much?", "YTA. It's her place, she can get ready for work where she chooses to. It seems like she was intentionally doing things to make sure you don't have peace. Also if the living room was an option to sleep, why wouldn't you sleep there instead of sharing a bed?", "So according to your other post you also skipped out on another cousin's graduation with the promise of getting them an amazing gift instead. And you did that because you went to see a band/concert.\n\nSo why is this all going on when you're \"homeless\"? Are you struggling for money or not?

Let me get this right .. You want your older Cousin to move out of her space which she graciously shares with you, so you can get more sleep ? Maybe the solution would be for you to go to sleep earlier or share the RV, if you need the rest.", "YTA. \nYou sound really entitled by asking her to move off her bed and on to the sofa. Why can\u2019t you do that?  Although I do know it\u2019s hard because you are homeless, but it is not your house, you cannot dictate what goes on there, you are a guest.

It sounds like she\u2019s been more than accommodating\u2014I cannot believe you had the audacity to suggest she sleep on the couch. Why don\u2019t you sleep on the couch?

If her living her life in her own room is such an issue, then you either sleep on the couch or go share the RV with your mum, simple.\n\nSorry it is her room and she's being accommodating enough letting you share her space and bed, do t make her and her family regret it because I've a feeling her parents will choose her or if its her place then she can kick you out.\n\nDon't bite the hand that feeds you or in this case provides a roof over your head.", "YTA Very entitled and ungrateful, why don't you sleep in the living room?", "INFO: Why don\u2019t you use the bathroom to get ready for work in the mornings? How are you saving for your own place when all you do is babysit a couple times a week? How did you possibly sit there and type all that out without realizing how entitled you sound?", "YTA \n\nHer room, her house- she does as it works for her.\nYou sit quiet and maybe help with cleaning if you appreciate at least a bit not being homeless", "This is so unreasonable and entitled that I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. For the off chance people as entitled as OP do exist\u2026 YTA The solution is very simple. Move out and see whether people in a shelter will be as understanding as your cousin.", "YTA. \n\nShe opened up her home, her bedroom and all her stuff for you and you can't suck up a bit of noise in appreciation?\n\nIf you don't like this, you know what the solution is. Get a full time job, or at least a job that requires you to work more often, and you move out.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nI get that your situation is shitty, but it's the one you've got right now. Your cousin is being extremely gracious sharing her space and her bed with you. She is trying to stick to her routine (given that it's her room) and making accommodations where she can -- she keeps the lights off, she tries not to make extra noise, she turns the fan back on. She's already accommodating you, and to ask for more is entitled. To ask her to sleep in the living room is over the top. Why don't you just sleep in the living room then?", "YTA\n\n>I asked her if she can start getting ready in the bathroom or maybe start sleeping in the living room\n\nWhy can't **you** sleep in the living room? It's her house and her room that she's graciously letting you stay in *rent free*.\n\n>I am homeless\n\nStop being so dramatic. Your cousin is letting you live with her. You have a stable place to live and sleep.", "YTA, get a sleep mask and some ear plugs.", "You\u2019re twenty years old. Get a steady job that pays well enough to move out-factory, etc. Or get a second job. She\u2019s letting you live with her AND share her bed. You need to be grateful and not so entitled. Go sleep on the couch yourself. Better yet, get up and help clean and take care of the house you are living in RENT FREE. Grow up. YTA", "Girl WHAT. This is HER home that you\u2019ve essentially invaded. She does not need to alter her routine for your comfort, you need to find a way to deal. \n\nAnd you were insanely out of line suggesting she sleep in the living room holy smokes.", "Wow, the audacity of living somewhere rent free and then asking your host to rearrange their whole life for you instead of being appreciative.  If I were your cousin, you'd be living in a tent in the back yard.", "Neither of you are assholes. You\u2019re dealing with a stressful situation and so is she and you\u2019re both trying to make the best of it. It looks like this blow up could have been avoided if you both had communicated open and honestly in gentle ways leading up to this. Compromise on some things- she certainly has!! She\u2019s already doing a lot for you: sharing her space, her things, her time. \n\nI think the fact she\u2019s willing to turn the fan back on and get dressed and ready in the dark for you says a lot. If I were you would sit and reflect on the things they are already doing for you and changes they have made to their routines for you, and then reflect on the things you are doing for them in return for their kindness.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be an asshole. There can be a happy ending.\n\nEdited to add clarifying text that OP needs to do better and do some self reflecting.", "NTA. She\u2019s being inconsiderate by getting ready in the room while you are sleeping. It would be so much easier if she just moved her things to the bathroom - which likely has better lighting anyway. I suggest you help her do this and offer to do the same when she\u2019s sleeping\n\nHowever asking her to sleep on the couch is too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
