We have made some progress and had some setbacks but nothing I don't believe we can't work through. Couples counseling I feel like has recently started to work. She tells me today that she wants a divorce. I am not too surprised because I have thought about it as well  but it's not what I want. We had an extremely long conversation today and I begged and pleaded for her to reconsider and she said she would think about it. We own 2 homes and the other one is vacant right now. She wants to separate for a while and asked me to go stay there. I told her it was not happening. That if she wanted the divorce and to separate that she could go and stay in the other home. I don't want my kids to feel like their dad left them and blame me for the separation and possible divorce when I am the one fighting to make it work.

Because you're right about the message that sends. The comments asking \"but who is the primary caregiver?\" have a point. But you should not feel pressured *right at this moment* to leave just because today is the day your wife makes her big decision. \n\nThere's time enough tomorrow (etc) to discuss where the children should live. \n\nAnd I'm sorry for your troubles.", "NTA She wants the separation but doesn't want to be inconvienced with moving houses?

Simple as that.", "NTA you should not have to leave your home. It\u2019s her decision, there is a new house she can move out", "NTA.  The person who wants the divorce leaves the house (unless there are extenuating circumstances like abuse).  She wants the change, she needs to make the change.", "NTA - First off, sorry you are going thru this - it's difficult no matter how you look at it, especially when kids are involved.  Whoever is the primary caregiver with the kids should stay in the home they are used to - and maybe consider swapping occasionally for the other parent to get some quality time/bedtimes.  Yet above all else - PLEASE, while it is difficult - don't go down the blame game road with the kids.  You are a couple, and yes, you want to keep trying and she wants space - but there is no magic ball saying that your way is the right way...plus who knows how it will play out.  Speak to your therapists and get key words and phrases to use with the kids to keep it as healthy as possible--FOR THE KIDS", "NTA\n\nShe asked for the divorce and you two co-own another home she can use.  That would be her choice. BUT, furnishings would need to be addressed.\n\n(This assumes you equally co-own the house you live in.)", "NTA- if she wants to leave you, then let her. You didn't ask for the divorce, she did.", "NTA, since you actually perform more of the basic day to day needs of the children per your comments, and she is the one who wants the divorce, she can relocate. I will tell you though you need to see an attorney asap, if to only draw up a separation and custody agreement to have in place. I'm not saying this to be vindictive, I'm saying this to protect both you and your wife as well as your children during this time, don't for a moment think this is an unreasonable step.", "INFO: What size are the two houses? Are they both in the same school district? What's most important is what's best for the children. If you anticipate a 50/50 custody situation and both houses can accommodate that, then there's nothing wrong with having her move to the other house if she wants to separate or divorce, unless the other house is in a state of disrepair.\n\nETA: NTA. Don't frame it to the children as anyone \"leaving\" anybody, but there's no apparent reason you should be the one to move.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants the divorce then she should leave the house.", "NTA.

When I found out my ex-wife was having an affair and she said she wanted a divorce, I told her she can handle all of that from her own house, not the one that we share.

Because you leaving she might try to make you a deadbeat to a court.", "NTA you are not the one \"leaving\" the relationship", "NTA. From comments it seems her habits are a big factor in the pending divorce/separation and you split child duties evenly. She wants a divorce instead of working on the issues she can move to the second home. That shouldn't be put on you to leave because you're the male.", "NTA. Her choice, she may leave. Also, she may be asking you to leave because in divorce proceedings she\u2019s may be advised to file a bs restraining order and all that would play into her getting that particular house in the end.", "NTA\nSmart decision not to leave. Bring this up in future counseling sessions.\n\nAlso prepare yourself in case she decides to go through with leaving the home. Set clear boundaries on how often you will see the kids and them sleeping over. Also get your P's and Q's together. Talk to a divorce lawyer and consider what things you want out of the divorce (incase she files for it).", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why it has to be you.

You both have tried to save the marriage, but it isn't working. \n\nIt's OK that you don't want a divorce, but you can't force someone to stay married to you. \n\nYou better get used to compromising, because a lot of negotiating is in your future if you two divorce. \n\nWhat is your compromise about the living situation? \n\nYou better start reading books and watching YouTubes on how to Coparent after divorce in a healthy way, since the odds are that you two won't stay together. \n\nThe kids are most important.", "NAH. Your positions are equivalent. She probably doesn\u2019t want them to feel like their mother left them either.  How about if the kids stay in the house where they are now and you & your wife take turns living in each house & moving back & forth.", "INFO: Who is the primary caregiver for the children (gets them up in the morning, to school, helps with homework, packs their lunches etc)?  \n\n\nIf she wants to separate and you have a second home then that seems perfectly reasonable that she is the one who leaves to go and live there. \n\nHowever: presumably the other house is in a different area, and you'd be expecting her not to take the children with her. A mother is unlikely to be willing to leave her children and you know it, that's quite manipulative. Taking them with her would be more disruptive to them. Not having the person around who normally deals with their daily routine would also be disruptive, and probably make things very difficult for them. This could be a cause of trauma to them, and make them resent your wife for leaving, which could, by a skilled lawyer be made out to be parental alienation.", "nah\n\nbut it might be best for the children if they stay in the main house and parents switch every week or 2 weeks. Asuming it is a no fault divorce, that might be doable. with both parents exaly responsable for childcare, no partner has rights over the main house over the other.

Neither one of you gets to just declare that the other moves out.", "I think that really depends on who cares for the children primarily.

The kids stay put and the parents rotate staying at the house. Made easier with already having a second house.", "The arrangements for the kids will have to be agreed on from scratch. Even if she was the primary caregiver, that doesn't mean it should necessarily continue after separation.", "If it's not in the same school district, then the person who should move is the one who is NOT going to be the primary caretaker for the kids. Why disrupt their lives more than necessary? Let them stay where they are. So, if you're the primary caretaker, she moves.

One week on and off for both of you in the kids\u2019 home?  \n\nBecause if this separation is permanent, eventually you both are going to have to divide up custody. Would you prefer the kids shuttle between houses each week or is keeping in their\nchildhood home more important?

She also is constantly changing jobs or is unemployed because doesn't know what she wants to do but has me as a financial safety net.", "Ok, then NAH.  Y'all will just have to hash out asset separation, custody, etc. as best as you can.  A bit of advice though - you might want to start taking a long-term view of this.  The two of you will have joint custody, so the kids will be living in two houses, and who's \"left\" whom is about the marriage, not the parenting - she's divorcing you, not the kids.  Plan for the peaceful future you want, not the painful present you have.", "I\u2019m sorry this sounds so much like my parents relationship that it\u2019s actually kinda scary lol.", "Excellent advice"]}
