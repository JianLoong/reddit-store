Your husband is deep in the fog of grief, but reading to a grave for hours every day is not a healthy coping mechanism, especially when it is at the expense of his own living children and wife.\n\n You're right to try to get him back into therapy because he's not coping. I won't call him an AH because this grief must still be pretty raw. But do keep trying to get him help. Can his family or friends talk to him? Is there anyone else who is worried about this behaviour? \n\nSorry you're going through this on top of your own grief for your SIL and helping your children through a tough time. I hope you all get the help you need.", "I\u2019ve read the responses here and folks are focusing on a poor choice of words on your part. I\u2019m reading it as several conversations, pleadings, and escalating pitch of now arguments that got you here.\n\nFirst, please know - No, this isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d to not be able to resume some semblance of normalcy months later. No, it isn\u2019t okay to put your wife and children on hold, as it were, to sit for hours every day grave side. He needs some help.\n\nI feel for you both. I understand your need for your partner. And I understand the need to grieve, I\u2019ve lost family. \n\nBut he needs to grasp that life moves on, and he has some responsibilities that just don\u2019t wait - his children and wife being top of that list. If he can drag his behind out of bed and continue to work, but not be at all attentive at home, he\u2019s taken for granted you\u2019ll just hold the fort and he can check out. And that isn\u2019t okay, not for this long and this frequency.\n\nNTA", " NTA\u2026.I lost my dad, and I didn\u2019t stop taking care of my kids. Nor would my dad have wanted me to.", "NTA.   I\u2019m widowed with children. My spouse passed away when my kids were quite young.  While I understand and truly empathize with the depth of pain that happens with losing your loved one, children need their parents, both parents whenever possible.  I am certain his sister, like my spouse, wouldn\u2019t want your husband to get so stuck in his grief that he winds up ignoring his kids.  Someone\u2019s death should not result in you in disregarding the living.  If your husband is not present for your children, he probably is not present for his mom either, who must be grieving as well.  Your husband needs help navigating his grief.  My suggestion is that you talk to him and maybe reach a compromise.  Suggest that you backoff for now if he seeks help, at least one day a week.  It doesn\u2019t have to a therapist.  It can be a grief support group or seeking help from a trusted person at your church or faith institution.  He can go alone, with you or maybe even go with his mom.\n\nedit:  I would also suggest that you look for forums/chats more specific to help people grieving the loss of the loved one.", "NTA. Can you try to work with him on starting to wind down his time at the grave? Like start with 3 days a week and then cut down to 2 next month and so on. Are his parents still living? Are they concerned about his behavior at all? Perhaps they could help.", "NTA\nIt's not a healthy thing to do, grieving is fine but not to the extent when he's not present anymore in his family's and his own life. Therapy sounds like the best option, maybe try to figure out why he is against it? Maybe some way he can agree to that if you explain how you haven't had have any support caring for your kids for three months.", "NAH\n\nHe needs grieve however he needs to, but if that grieving process is becoming detrimental to his family, then it is not healthy. You\u2019ve tried to communicate this for months and encourage therapy which is why you are not the AH.", "I know what books he is reading, [https://sevenseasdanmei.com/#releases](https://sevenseasdanmei.com/#releases)\n\nNTA  spending all your time at a grave isn't healthy. On a side note, if he is reading all of them its gonna get into the 40s. Lots of series that the company is translating to english", "NTA\n\nYes he is grieving, but he is actively harming his family in the process", "NAH. \n\nHe\u2019s grieving in the only way he knows how to still be close to his sister. You need help with the children after school/work. \n\nY\u2019all need to work together in finding a resolution. Maybe an every other day scenario for right now. Something can be worked out. You both will need to be prepared to give & take.", "NTA there are healthy and unhealthy ways to grieve. Dissociating from his family for hours every day to read to his dead sister is an unhealthy coping mechanism. I would say the same if he was locking himself in a man cave and gaming. The idea behind the reading is sweet but not the execution. If he wanted to read to her from 7-8 every day or from whenever dinner ended for an hour that would be fine. Not being home at all for his wife or children during the entire evening is wrong. You need to tell your MIL what he has been doing and why you have a problem with it. The world doesn\u2019t stop for death and he has other obligations.", "NTA he has kids. He doesn\u2019t get to grieve to their detriment. You might have to do something drastic but he doesn\u2019t get to abandon his kids", "NTA. He may be grieving,  but he's doing it at the expense of his family. He needs to find another way to cope.", "NAH, he's got a particularly intense bout of grief, but he also has you and the kids.\n\nHe's quite unlikely to stop, and you asking him to do so was just setting yourself up for a \"no.\"\n\nIt sounds like he still goes to work, so you may wish to talk to him about treating being with you and the kids as a job right now. Talk with him and both of you assign him specific tasks that he thinks he can handle together. He may end up going to the graveyard later and staying later, but this way he doesn't lose time with his sister and you and the kids get to see him.\n\nTo echo some other participants, this isn't average-intensity grief. A therapist would do him some good if he decides to see someone, but journaling/writing letters to his sister is also a strong option. But I want to confirm that, of other people try to minimize your and your husband's experiences, that they're likely referring to a different pattern of grief response.", "NAH He needs grief therapy. Reading these books to her, at her grave, has become an extreme coping mechanism. You\u2019re not the asshole, he isn\u2019t either. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with these books, are they suitable for your kids? If so, maybe you could ask him to read to them. If not, he could read books his sister loved when she was the age of your kids. His sister will still hear him reading, but even better, he will be sharing something she loved with your kids. \n\nBUT, he should still get some grief counseling. In the last six years I have lost my husband, my middle daughter, and four of my animal companions. I had to move from our house to a smaller house closer to my older kids. I started with a grief counselor after my husband died. Talking with her has helped so much. \n\nYour husband is caught up in grief. I hope you can find a way to get him help. Sometimes it feels like losing the grief means you don\u2019t care that your loved one is gone. Banning him totally from going to her grave and reading may not be the best. If he could go once a week, that might make it easier for both of you, and your kids. Maybe reading a bit of her favorite books a few times a week to your kids. I read to mine before they went to sleep. \n\nI hope you and he can find a way through this.", "It's only been 3 months. His grief is super fresh. Of course he isn't going to be back to normal right now. Your family has to grow to make room for his grief. This is an unfortunate aspect of grieving/losing someone. \n\nHowever, he does need to be in therapy and he does need to be home for his children. Perhaps he can visit his sister once a week or only for 20 minutes after work. You guys need to find a balance.\n\nNAH", "This is tough. It's really recent, so I get that he still needs to grieve, but at the same time he is neglecting time with his kids. I'm going NAH. You both need to sit down and have a conversation about this. I agree that he should probably be talking to someone. Be compassionate when you approach him.", "NTA. Yes, he's grieving but that doesn't make it okay to abandon you and the kids. I agree he should see a grief counselor.", "I don't think anyone is the asshole here.\n\nYou are concerned about him, about your children, and you are worried about your kids never seeing him. That's being a great mother and a great wife. No asshole move here at all.\n\nHe is grieving his sister who passed away recently (3 months is really recent) by reading him books she liked. Maybe she loved white cats as well. Even if he overreacted a bit, I really can't call him an asshole as well.\n\nMy verdict is NAH.", "NAH. Grief takes time and from what I\u2019m reading, you\u2019re not expecting him to be over his grief, you\u2019re concerned about his process. What seemed like a sweet, healthy way to honor her now is taking away from his relationship with his kids and you. I hope he can find support so he can engage with his family while he grieves.", "NTA He's grieving in his own way. Give it a little more time. I see bith sudes here, there's no asshole in this situation. \n\nIn a month or two, tell him you want to do couples counseling.", "NTA.  He is allowed to grieve, but what he is doing is not right, he is literally abandoning his family.  The way he is acting is beyond grief, he needs help.", "Info why don\u2019t you ask him to take you and the kids with you to read the stories it\u2019s supporting him and the kids will probably enjoy the stories maybe pick out their favourite to read to their aunt", "Hmmm this is tricky because I think the verdict comes down to how you approached it. Was it a calm, caring convo expressing how you know he is grieving but are concerned this might not be a long term healthy coping mechanism? Or was it a blunt \u201cyou need to stop\u201d\n\nIt seems like he does need therapy. He need to figure out a different way to grieve and honor his sister while still participating in his own life. \n\nUltimately, I say NAH as long as you approach it the right way.", "NTA\nWhile there is nothing wrong with occasionally reading at her grave, he is doing it so much that he is neglecting his surviving family.", "It\u2019s only been 3 months that isn\u2019t enough time for anyone to grieve. I understand you need him to help with the kids but it\u2019s going to take alot of time. Maybe talk to his parents or get support from your own family to help with the kids. I saw someone said about including the kids to go read I think that would be a great idea. Maybe you all can go together", "NTA three months of this is not fair to you. He needs therapy.

One, you don\u2019t have the right to \u201cban\u201d him from anything. Two, he\u2019s clearly grieving and to approach him this way is a major AH move. Guy\u2019s sister passed away and he gets relief by reading to her grave. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve tried to talk to him about it (I assume unsuccessfully), but telling him he just isn\u2019t allowed to go anymore was crappy. \n\nMaybe try to limit his time, maybe an hour a day. Maybe just certain days of the week. Talk to his family, see how they\u2019re doing, see if they can join you in talking to him. Tell him that the kids are missing him.
