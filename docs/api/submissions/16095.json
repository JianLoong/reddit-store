I [22F] have a sister who 19. My sister is dating a guy, Matthew. She met him sometime earlier in the school year at her university. He\u2019s a couple years older than her. He seems like a nice friendly boy and I have no issues with him. I do however have issues with my sister. \nMe and my sister best friends until we were teenager. I being the older one stopped hanging out with her. She became popular in her own right and it was all good. We weren\u2019t too close after that. \n\nSo onto the main issue at hand. Sometime last year my sister met this guy. He\u2019s in his early 30\u2019s and met when my sister was 18. That summer he took her around the world (exaggerating, he took her to Spain, Italy, Greece, Mexico and to Disney world) all in one summer. I was ended up looking him up and that when I found out his age, and that he owns a couple of businesses, one being pretty successful. He\u2019s the typical, attractive, successful, rich dude. Still the idea of my sister hanging out with some creep in his 30\u2019s made me sick. My parents weren\u2019t a fan either but because my sister was 18 they couldn\u2019t stop it. \n\nSo fast forward to after summer and shes back in university. Idk what happened between them but she met Matthew and started dating him. \n\nMy sister told me she went to Cancun for spring break. When I asked her with who she told me the rich guy. I was shocked. I asked what about Matthew and she told me she told him she just came home for spring break and that me and her went to visit our grandma. Lol wtf. \n\nAnyways the other night Matthew and my sister were at my parents house, and I was also there. During dinner Matthew asked me how I\u2019m doing and all that. I said fine. For some reason unknown to my my sister butted in and just started saying my life was boring and miserable. Idk why. But I got upset and said I\u2019d rather be boring than hang out with men almost twice my age and low to my boyfriend about it.\n\nIt caused a scene in which Matthew left. My sister called me a bitch and my mom called me a brat? My dad was fine with it but did say I made things awkward.

However, your sister chose to include you in her lie by telling her BF that she is with you while cheating on him. By doing this, she made you an accomplice to her lie and you were within your right to tell the truth.", "NTA - she lied to her boyfriend and got caught. Hooray!", "NTA\n\nYour sister used you as a cover excuse to lie to M without your permission -- which means you have zero obligation to keep her secret now.

Cheating isn't just an emotional betrayal; it puts the cheater's primary partner at risk of catching STDs because most people use non-barrier methods in monogamous relationships.

Quite the boulder that you rolled through the house eh?", "Why ask a question for which you already know the answer?
