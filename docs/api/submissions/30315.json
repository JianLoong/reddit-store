This is a second attempt to post this. \n\nI (34F) have a friend (33F) we\u2019ll call her Stacey by who has been going through some tough times (trouble with her students at school, can\u2019t find a house to buy, minor health issues.) She also tends to overthink and spiral into very \u201cwoe is me, I\u2019m a terrible teacher, friend, daughter, etc.\u201d A mutual friend, Jane, asked Stacey to stop talking about Jane\u2019s future wedding (Jane wasn\u2019t even engaged yet) and Stacey didn\u2019t talk to Jane for three very long weeks. \n\nLast Friday, I got done with work around 4:30 and texted both Stacey and Jane to see if they wanted to go to dinner. Jane had plans, but Stacey said she had a few things to do but could meet me later. I\u2019m trying to watch how much I eat, so I wasn\u2019t going to eat before dinner. I texted at 5:30 to confirm she was thinking about dinner and only got minimal responses (<1/hr) until she called at 7:30 then she didn\u2019t really want to decide on a place to eat, so we decided not to eat together. \n\nYesterday, exactly one week later, Stacey texted our group chat again and said she\u2019d be free \u201cat 8ish\u201d if we wanted to get food. It was 5:45. I said it sounded great and suggested a favorite spot. I got no reply from Stacey. When I still hadn\u2019t heard from her at 8:10 I called her. No answer. I texted her any told her I was just going to eat leftovers at home. She responded at 8:20 with \u201cI thought I told you I had the play until 8, Sorry.\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the AH. I waited until I had eaten something and then wrote: \u201cI think my master\u2019s class from last semester would say that this is a difference of expectations. When you said you\u2019d be free at 8ish I expected to have plans to meet you somewhere at 8 or shortly after, not to be tracking you down at 8:15 to make plans to meet somewhere which could take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to get to and an additional 30 minutes to get food.\u201d Stacey didn\u2019t respond. \n\nAbout an hour later, Jane called and said that my text message sent Stacey into a panic attack. She felt like I needed to apologize. My mother feels the same way. I can see both sides, and I made sure to sleep on it, but I still feel very hurt by how she\u2019s treated me and I don\u2019t feel like the AH. \n\nTLDR: My friend doesn\u2019t respond to make plans with me  but expects me to wait for her.

It\u2019s somewhat a difference in expectations but honestly i think she sounds like a difficult friend to have and maybe you should take a step back for now. I would not apologize because there is nothing wrong with that text.", "NTA, but your friend is probably too fragile to be much of a friend. I get that some people are just oblivious to the needs of others, as Stacey is, but when that same person expects to be treated with kid gloves at all times, and if they do get called out they withdraw for three weeks, as she did with Jane, or have a panic attack, as she with you\u2014that's a hard no in a friendship to me. And after she got the silent treatment for making a simple objection to Stacey herself, Jane should know better than to circle the wagons because your text \"sent\" Stacey into a panic attack. Ya'll are too old for this ridiculousness.", "NTA\n\nI think she could have some kind of personality issue.\nI would stop counting on her.\n\nAnd certainly don't apologize.", "NTA but you all need to plan and communicate better WAY BEFORE the meeting time.\n\nNext time, propose a time and location and ask people to RSVP within 15 minutes or you\u2019ll plan to do something else.", "Nta. \nI can also see both sides. However if you make plans and the persons doesn\u2019t show me up, you have the right to get annoyed and call her out for her behaviour.", "NAH \n\nIt's not your fault she had a panic attack. You're right this is just a difference in expectations.", "NTA-ish. I have a couple of friends like this and the only way to deal with them is to be very, very specific when you want to make plans.\n\nWhen Stacey said she'd be free at 8-ish, respond with 'great, I've booked XYZ for 8:15, see you there'. When she said she had a few things to do but would meet you later, again 'great, I was thinking Italian would be good, so let's meet at ABC at 7:30-please let me know if you'll be later than that'. If she doesn't respond, another message 30 minutes beforehand to say 'Hey, didn't hear back from you so I've made other plans'-and nothing more. Do not explain, apologise or offer to meet later.\n\nYou say you're trying to watch what you eat, so don't put yourself in a position where you're starving and waiting around on someone. She may not mean to be so vague or careless with plans, but that doesn't help when you're ready to start gnawing on a stranger's arm because you're hungry.", "NTA - She has repeatedly let you down. You are allowed to respond. You didn\u2019t speak to her unkindly but she doesn\u2019t get to repeatedly disrespect you and waste your time like that.", "Nta. I would not want to be friends with someone like Stacey.  She's rude, irresponsible, and not much of a friend.  Why are you friends ?", "NTA. If I waited to eat that long just for her to not respond and/or cancel, I would\u2019ve handled that significantly worse than you did. The \u201changry-ness\u201d is strong with this one. I think you did fine, OP.", "NTA and honestly I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t say something sooner.\n\nHaving mental health issues isn\u2019t an excuse. She did something that hurt your feelings, and you didn\u2019t even tell her that she hurt your feelings (which you\u2019d have been justified in doing so)\u2014 you just told her that there was some miscommunication between the two of you and that you\u2019d expected different things.\n\nShe needs professional help if a message like that sends her into a panic attack. \n\nYou would be very justified if you severed the friendship.", "NTA. Stacey sounds exhausting. Does she have a panick attack every time you call her out on her shitty behavior?", "Stacey needs medication. And a more organized life. You're not to blame and you're NTA. You can apologize if you want to, to smooth things over, but I don't see that you owe it.", "None you AH...you all just seem passive af and need to learn to communicate better and set those expectations right out on the table.", "\u201cI think my master\u2019s class from last semester\u201d lmao YTA just for that comment.
