You know your daughter, and the fact that your other kids are divided - meaning that some of them agree with not inviting her - I'd say you are justified in it. If a sibling also thinks their sister shouldn't be there, that's pretty damning.

Honestly why chance it.", "NTA, it's your wedding.  I can see where she is hurt, but she needs to realize you aren't at a point where her past misdeeds have been fully forgiven or she has regained your trust.  That's life; you have to deal with the consequences of your actions.  If you were a drama starter than expect not to be invited to events where people want to be happy and drama free.  If you have \"changed\" expect it will take time for people to regain trust in you.  The thing is she is being excluded so just know she is feeling that.  It doesn't make you a jerk because you chose not to invite her, but she is lashing out because of that feeling of exclusion.  She may even be saying mean things to you and lashing out because she is upset with herself (if she has fully changed that is).", "NTA.

That is one of my favourite quotes. She's allowed to be angry but she needs to understand that she hurt you & you will heal in your own time.

It got back to her and she is pissed. \n\nis she an addict?  this is very typical addict behavior.  They spend years violating your trust, then when they decide in THEIR mind that they've changed, you're the bad guy for not trusting them.", "Let me set this up for you.\nIf someone who is a total stranger robs a house, gets caught and sent away for a few years, would you invite them back to your home after they get out? Back to her daughter, who has committed several offenses to her mom or family, because she is family they sounded like they gave her second chances, when the second chances gets old, there is just so much you can stand. Sometimes tough love is needed and not subjecting her daughter to the family in case of an incident. Even if people have been rehabilitated, something can set them off.", "NTA\n\nIf Noelle has reconciled with her past and has made changes, but can\u2019t understand why the people she has hurt may not be ready to pull out all the stops, she still has a way to go.\n\nIf the trust isn\u2019t there, not inviting her was something you needed to do. It\u2019s okay not to accept someone\u2019s polished persona sooner than you are prepared to do at the expense of your peace of mind. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding!", "NTA, Trust is something that is very valuable in a relationship and when it is broken, it can cause a tear or even a break in that relationship. I see trust as a vulnerable thing. You allow someone to someone up close and personal in your life and when they ruin it, it is hard to trust them again because it\u2019s like \u201cwhat if something else happens?\u201d It takes time and if you are not ready for that relationship to move forward, then that is okay.", "NTA OP.", "NTA, I wouldn't trust that girl with a $5 bill. She dug herself into that hole and it isn't your problem that she did. She should feel lucky you even talk to her after a stunt like that to be bluntly honest", "INFO: you said she got better, did she have an addiction or gambling problem that led to her stealing money from you?", "NTA at all. I have a relative who I loved, but his actions caused fallout. I get where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nEdit: from what I\u2019m reading from your comments, she never really face her consequences.", "NTA. I too had to go low contact with my first born because a lot of manipulation and activity that was hurtful became too overwhelming. If I am asked to be at events I try my best to make it but I no longer reach out. \n\nI\u2019m glad OPs child has improved but that doesn\u2019t mean OP should start involving them to the degree a family member who hasn\u2019t broken your heart/trust is involved.", "NTA\n\nWhile she could have perplexing feelings about this decision, it isn't her choice to make. If she didn't want to be in your life before, why invite her now?\n\nWhile I understand a family is a very precious relationship, being within that relationship means commanding  a great deal of trust and understanding, yet she clearly doesn't feel that trust and understanding. She seems to be leading an independent life herself, so she doesn't need to linger in yours and create problems.\n\nI think you did the right things. Congrats on your wedding!", "Esh. I get it, i do, im going through something similar w my step (drugs). But your daughter is doing well & making progress. While i understand she broke your trust & hurt you, 3yrs is a lot of time to prove that shes changed. Kinda feels like its more of a punishment. Which is your right but if shes been putting in effort & doing good for 3yrs, kinda harsh for a parent to not forgive (at least enough to have their own child at their wedding)", "NAH \n\nThough what is more important to you? Your relationship with your daughter or $400?", "I dont believe so because Noelle stole her grandmothers jewelry that was gifted by her dead husband and sold it, she also kept advancing on her sisters boyfriend so much so that the cops had to be called because she showed up at the dudes house and wouldnt respect his boundaries. The serious relationship between he and her sister ended because of her sexually harassing this poor dude. She has apparently gotten drunk and fought with people before among other things. The only people there she would have a relationship with is the one brother. She cut and burnt ties with everyone else. It is fair to assume she knows shes not invited.", "And I though I had was bad for asking my mom for a 5K loan.", "She was deff on pills or coke or smthn, you don't do all that for pot", "Caffeine is literally a drug. That's meaningless. \n\n30 years ago, when I was a teenager, I used weed to mitigate my depression. I was a good kid. I wasn't violent, didn't steal, didn't get in trouble. I certainly never acted in a \"scary way\".. I just chilled alone.\n\nBut my parents prejudice against weed put me through hell. They yelled at me, punished me, kicked me out. Just because society told them that weed was bad.\n\nThat prejudice was way more harmful to my life than pot ever was.", "Here's the crazy thing about having kids: occasionally, they'll do something radically different from what you taught them.\n\nI have taught my kids respect, kindness, have stressed the importance of communication. Their teachers adore them, they got great friends.\n\nEven *I* can't say with certainty \"they'd never steal x amount of money\", because, at the end of the day, they're their own person. I can't know every single path in life they'll take. I can't know what events that'll take place that may steer them in a direction that leads to behaviours I didn't teach or instill in them.\n\nKids become teenagers, then adults. A lot of life happens in between. As a parent, I just have to trust that they'll do the right thing.\n\nIt's delusional to think they'll never do wrong."]}
