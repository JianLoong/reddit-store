She broke your trust and has to work to rebuild your trust before you can fully invite her back into your life.", "NTA. You know your daughter, and the fact that your other kids are divided - meaning that some of them agree with not inviting her - I'd say you are justified in it. If a sibling also thinks their sister shouldn't be there, that's pretty damning. Rebuilding trust takes time, and if you aren't ready to have her at a high-stakes event like a wedding then you have every right to not invite her.", "NTA It's good you're talking again but you're right to have doubts. It's your day and you don't need to invite anyone you're not comfortable with being there.", "NTA you have 4000 reasons not to invite her. She is better now but how much better? Honestly why chance it.", "NTA, it's your wedding.  I can see where she is hurt, but she needs to realize you aren't at a point where her past misdeeds have been fully forgiven or she has regained your trust.  That's life; you have to deal with the consequences of your actions.  If you were a drama starter than expect not to be invited to events where people want to be happy and drama free.  If you have \"changed\" expect it will take time for people to regain trust in you.  The thing is she is being excluded so just know she is feeling that.  It doesn't make you a jerk because you chose not to invite her, but she is lashing out because of that feeling of exclusion.  She may even be saying mean things to you and lashing out because she is upset with herself (if she has fully changed that is).", "NTA.    You had to pay that credit card bill  when she racked it up", "NTA, but it's complicated. It's harsh to exclude someone who is trying to get better.

It sounds as though you still need to rebuild the trust in your relationship with your Daughter before you involve her in your new family and I don't blame you based on your post.\n\nIn the meantime, only You and your OH get to decide who you invite to your wedding, so if your relationship with her isn't quite there yet, try not to feel pressured to invite her.", "\"You don't get to hurt me & tell me how or when to heal\". That is one of my favourite quotes. She's allowed to be angry but she needs to understand that she hurt you & you will heal in your own time. If she can't accept that, she's not as far along as you think she is in her own healing. \n\nAll these people talking about how she WILL interpret it & talking about their own totally unrelated wedding stories need to stop projecting. She may interpret it any number of ways over time & truthfully, none of that is your problem. Also, the people saying 'she won't feel welcome in your new family' if y'all have been together 10 years, thats not a fucking thing & again, people need to stop projecting. \n\nPersonally, as someone that has had to go low contact with many of my family members, I would say: \"I love you very much & I'm proud of how far you have come. I am still healing myself, though. I need you to give me that space, time & respect for our relationship to move forward.\" Good luck & congrats on your marriage op!", "NAH here. At least not now.\n\nDo understand though that not inviting her to your wedding *will* be taken as a decision not to have a relationship with her.

But actions have consequences.  and while you may be completely justified in not inviting her you may want to reconsider. or be ok with her choosing to go NC permanently.  Often times weddings and funerals are time when family puts their stuff aside and come together.  Any chance this might happen here?  could she just come to the reception?", "NTA....But....this is probably one of those moves that undoes any of the relationship mending you had over the last while.", "NTA but she won\u2019t be your daughter after this. If you have an issue with her going NC, rethink your strategy.", "NTA\n\nThis is not the event to throw the dice and see how she is doing.

Any backsliding that happens in your relationship with her will be your fault.
