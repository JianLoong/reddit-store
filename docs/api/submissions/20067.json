You know your daughter, and the fact that your other kids are divided - meaning that some of them agree with not inviting her - I'd say you are justified in it. If a sibling also thinks their sister shouldn't be there, that's pretty damning.

Honestly why chance it.", "NTA, it's your wedding.  I can see where she is hurt, but she needs to realize you aren't at a point where her past misdeeds have been fully forgiven or she has regained your trust.  That's life; you have to deal with the consequences of your actions.  If you were a drama starter than expect not to be invited to events where people want to be happy and drama free.  If you have \"changed\" expect it will take time for people to regain trust in you.  The thing is she is being excluded so just know she is feeling that.  It doesn't make you a jerk because you chose not to invite her, but she is lashing out because of that feeling of exclusion.  She may even be saying mean things to you and lashing out because she is upset with herself (if she has fully changed that is).", "NTA.
