The current plan is for there not to be a funeral but a memorial in a few weeks' time. My wife had tendon surgery 2 1/2 weeks ago and still can't do much around the house so I have been doing all of it when I am home. Pretty much all of my emotional and mental energy has been going into caring for her, the house, work, and supporting her. She gets some help during the day while I'm at work from her sister who comes to sit with her since she can work from anywhere with her work laptop. I've been happy to do this for my wife. It's just that when I got the news the other day not even an hour after my wife was asking what I was making for dinner and started talking about her surgery again and I did my best to be there for her, and take care of her and me. She knows I was close to this aunt and uncle so I took a couple of bereavement days and she kept saying stuff like \"I really need you right now.\" and \"It's so hard seeing you sad like this I don't like it.\" \n\nI told her we really need to support each other right now and asked for support and patience. Her sister came over and asked why I was so mopey. I informed her about my aunt and uncle and she told me to pull it together for my wife who is still recovering from surgery. I packed a bag and told my wife if she isn't going to give me some support and let her sister talk like that to me, then I'd be going to a hotel for a few days to give myself space to grieve as I need. That was last night, I'm still at the hotel but my wife and her sister are calling me constantly and leaving messages that I'm being selfish, and that I can grieve during the memorial with my family.

You cannot box it to a particular time period, the memorial will just be part of the process.\n\nBe straight with her. Tell her that you need this time and if her sister is that bothered about you \"bring negligent\" then she can step up and look after her. \n\nI hope you find the peace you are looking for, but remember that you could be going back to a hostile environment that will only hinder your grieving process", "Strong NTA; I understand and empathize with the both of you.

It sounds like you and your wife both need each other.
