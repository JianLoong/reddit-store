NTA. \nNot sure if they are burnt out, but the age difference is for sure a reason for some of your problems.\nI can understand your parents might need help in the house, but this is no excuse to have you socially ostracized. In addition, if they are too old or sick to need additional care, one of your older siblings should be stepping up. Not you. You should be enjoying your teens. \nMy suggestion is to talk to them. Try to understand such a difference in treatment and explain how this is affecting you. No screams, no accusations. And try to find a common ground with them for getting more free time with some compromise from you. \nOnce you do it, you gave a fair try and should not feel guilty to move ahead. As much as is painful for a parent to see the kids go, children should be brought up to the world. Meaning that at one point, you will go have your life, like them or not. Better to try and have it in good terms. If this doesn\u2019t work, call your brother and ask if he can take you in.", "NTA. In one if your responses you said your parents rely on you.

Why can they cook for themselves?", "Fuck em. leave.", "You think your parents rely on you - that's what they want you to think. They are not being reasonable or fair using you as a servant. You are a child and what you want to do is is not unreasonable. You are burned out and the brother sounds like a good option. NTA.", "Your parents should not be relying on you. Should you help....yes \n I'm a 63 yr old woman who lives alone and I rely on one but myself. It's ridiculous that they rely on you that much but do zero for you .", "Your parents are NOT your responsibility at all.  You are the child.  It is the other way around.  If your brother is making this offer and you would be moving into a good situation, please take advantage of it.  Your parents need to learn to take care of themselves.  They are not old, but by your description of their behavior they act as if they are 90.  If poor lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, etc.) are contributing to this perpetual \"tiredness\" and lack of action, then you moving out and forcing them to take care of themselves is probably the medicine they need to make changes in their own life.  \n\nI speak these things as a parent of teenagers that do have household chores, but are free to have social lives too.\n\nYou sound like a wonderfully compassionate and thoughtful person.  Best of luck to you.", "Gee, I wonder why\u2026Quite a track record for your parents.", "Call your brother and have him come pick you up asap before your parents ground you again.", "I\u2019m 55 and my wife is 60. I\u2019m also disabled and chronically ill. We both have full time jobs and hobbies we enjoy. Our 20 yr old daughter has some chores but we mostly expect her to live her life as she navigates school, work, and the transition to adulthood. She doesn\u2019t owe us anything other than honesty, respect, kindness, and basic hygiene. Unless your parents are *much* more disabled than me (which is obviously possible), they are feeding you a load of bs. \n\nMy guess is that you were an oops baby and that your parents are burned out and taking it out on you. I\u2019m really sorry about that. You absolutely deserve to be able to see your friends  and otherwise do the things that teenagers do.\n\nI hope you take your brother up on his offer. It sounds like he has a sense of what you\u2019re going through and wants to give you a better life. You are not responsible for your parents. You\u2019re just not. \n\nOh\u2014and obligatory Reddit caution\u2014if you do decide to move in with your brother (and I hope you do), ask him to help you find your essential documents (birth certificate and social security card) and keep them safe.", "This is absolutely insane and abusive. They are treating you like their servant. Their behavior is inexcusable, imo. You are NTA.", "They are not being reasonable or fair using you as a servant.", "Yes lots. Things that I thought was normal before like laundry, dishes and stuff like that.", " Their laziness is not your burden to bear. Take your brother up on his offer.", "Yep I was. They are not disabled or ill. I\u2019ve emailed my brother as I don\u2019t have my phone and he has given me a list of documents to get. I\u2019m going to try and find it all when they are out this afternoon. Thank you for your advice", "It can be normal to have some chores growing up. If you're doing everything while they do nothing, you're their servant.\n\nYou have options, use them and don't feel guilty about it.", "My mom is close to 70 and still insists on cooking food me when I visit. my dad is almost 60 and is running ultra marathons. Your parents are just lazy.", "I\u2019m 63 and my health isn\u2019t great but I still take care of my house and cook my own meals. Maybe if you leave it will force them to get off their butts. Maybe they need some mental health care as they might be depressed.", "Hi op just another person throwing perspective you probably have too much of but here goes anyway. My parents are your parents age but I\u2019m older than you (25). I still live at home and have to actively fight for my independence. My mom would still make all my meals and do my laundry if I let her and my dad would take care of my car or anything else if I didn\u2019t and basically they are awesome parents, normal probably. Point being, your parents should be taking care of you and wanting you to have an active social life.  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not getting to live like a normal teen, I hope you can go live with your brother soon.", "Your brother is completely right. You feeling like you do about moving out is EXACTLY what the parents are aiming for. There is a very real reason ALL of your siblings moved out and stayed out, you OP, are learning that reason first hand. Please take your brothers offer, and focus on you.", "Your brother is correct. They are using you instead of taking care of themselves or hiring someone to help them. People make a lot of money being a caretaker for old people. Move out now.", "They ARE using you. 58 and 60 isn't old enough to not be able to take care of themselves, and in any case it isn't your job to take care of them anyway. You are the minor and they are the parents.\n\nMy folks are in their early 60s and my dad works a full day job while my mom tends to her garden and the house. And they do it with gusto. Your parents are just lazy and using their age as an excuse to basically have you as their slave.\n\nLive with your brother. He is knows their true nature, which is why he is on bad terms with them.", "They are using you, please get out and message your brother!", "My dad is 61 and he loaded a 650 pound HVAC system into a van by himself, (using like cinder blocks and levers of course, not like lifting the whole thing up) i think they can heat up some rice-a-roni themselves.", "Your dad's a beast. I wanna be like him when I grow up \ud83d\ude02"]}
