Op.\n\nGo live with your brother and calmly tell them you are not responsible for their choice to have you at an older age. Your siblings were allowed freedoms I assume? Point that out. And leave. They are nor so old that they should be incapable of caring for themselves. They've just seen you as too convenient and gotten used to using you. And that's what they're doing. Being complacent and using you. Because you are a minor and they're your parents so, in their mind, they Crack the whip and you do what you're told.\n\nNope. Go to your brothers.", "NTA. Your homework is important, but your schedule shouldn't be constrained by being expected to cook the family dinner every night.\n\nIf you cook once a week, and they told you you couldn't go out on Thursdays, because that was your cooking night, then that would be reasonable (although even then, cooking a different night so you could go out on Thursday would seem OK). But it sounds like you're always expected to stay home and cook for them.\n\nThey don't \"need your help at home\" - they don't have anything they need your help with. They are two adults, and you're the only kid.", "NTA. Your other family members want you to be ballast, Google \"rock the boat Reddit\" and you'll read a post that will make sense of this. Your mom is a total AH, as are the rest of the family. Get out as soon as you can and harden your heart to any attempts at manipulation. You don't owe anyone anything.", "NTA. I'd move out as soon as possible too.", "NTA, honestly if I was you I\u2019d be asking my siblings if I could live with one of them.", "NTA\n\n\nThat is abusive.", "NTA but honestly, I wouldn't warn them much, start planning, get any documents you may need (birth certificate, passport, etc.) and have it ready to go if needed.  Can one of your siblings that are on your side take you in?\n\nThe rest of the family as AH especially if they do not listen to your side of the story.  It's not your responsibility to take care of the house and your parents except to help out where you can, do chores etc.  You have a right to enjoy your school years, see your friends, go the games etc. (you might want to line up a ride if they are not going to help you).", "NTA. Save every cent you can. Keep it safe, and when you\u2019re ready, leave. It won\u2019t be easy, but it is doable. If you\u2019re going to make this work, you\u2019re going to need money, friends, and transportation. Also a job. \n\nGoing out on your own is terrifying and freeing. You\u2019ll screw up a bunch, and you\u2019ll learn a lot. But I\u2019ve got friends who are total morons, and they make it work. You can do this OP.", "NTA. You were honest. \n\nThey keep you from socializing once in a while. You still offer to cook for them and you still do your homework so personally I don't see the problem.\n\nI Think you need to talk to your parents and ask them why they are so hellbent on you being home to cook and not allowing you out at all.

You\u2019re shouldering an unfair burden at your age IMO It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a 16 yo to help with chores around the house, but it\u2019s another thing to deny them social time with friends or family AND to ignore parental responsibility (picking you up from practice). \n\nIf a sibling is willing able to help you, look into it. \n\nBest of luck to you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nBut let this be a lesson to you\n\nYour manipulative mother is going to do whatever she can do to keep you at home as her personal butler\n\nSo if you plan on moving out, start making plans now\n\nBust your ass in school so you can apply for scholarships.\n\nResearch student loans\n\nPick the brain of your guidance counselor\n\nAnd if you can find a way to make some money on the side, do so\n\nHave a plan and be ready so that when the time comes, you can move out and go to college and move on with your life", "NTA\nThey're sort of in the grandparents age group. Were you a surprise baby? Looks like they've burnt themselves out and are now neglectful of you.", "I\u2019m sorry that you were the last one after so long. However, this is not your fault. NTA. \nNot sure if they are burnt out, but the age difference is for sure a reason for some of your problems.\nI can understand your parents might need help in the house, but this is no excuse to have you socially ostracized. In addition, if they are too old or sick to need additional care, one of your older siblings should be stepping up. Not you. You should be enjoying your teens. \nMy suggestion is to talk to them. Try to understand such a difference in treatment and explain how this is affecting you. No screams, no accusations. And try to find a common ground with them for getting more free time with some compromise from you. \nOnce you do it, you gave a fair try and should not feel guilty to move ahead. As much as is painful for a parent to see the kids go, children should be brought up to the world. Meaning that at one point, you will go have your life, like them or not. Better to try and have it in good terms. If this doesn\u2019t work, call your brother and ask if he can take you in.", "NTA. In one if your responses you said your parents rely on you. I don\u2019t think they actually need you, I think since all your other siblings left as soon as they could, your parents are trying to hold you back, keep you from gaining any independence so that you don\u2019t leave. If your brother is willing to let you live with him, go for it. And don\u2019t feel guilty at all, because your parents feel no guilt for the way they\u2019re treating you.", "I think mom and dad are scared to be empty nesters.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents sounds like they resent you so badly that they're changing the rules they expect you to live by so they can just punish you for what appears to be arbitrary reasons.  It really seems that they're trying to isolate you as much as they legally can so you HAVE to (in their warped perspective) stay with them once you graduate school and be a live-in caretaker for your parents.

They punish you for being late when you can't help it and refuse to let you go out and have friends - that's abusive.  That's not normal.  That's not what good parents do.  Why do you think all your siblings moved out at 18?  It's obvious that they treated them like shit and couldn't handle your parents anymore and left.  Why would you feel guilty over stopping yourself from being abused?  You shouldn't.  Move in with your brother and watch how your mental health improves.  Your parents aren't good to you so they aren't good for you - don't feel bad because of that.  They are at fault, not you.", "NTA. Congrats OP you're their retirement plan!

If I was one minute late getting home I would get a month restriction to my bedroom, but my brother (half brother by step dad) could get away with anything and often blamed his mis-deeds on me and I got punished without thought.\n\nJust make sure your of legal age and have things lined up to where you can take care of yourself. It won't last forever.\n\nI had a friend that lived down the street whose brother was about 35 and he was 12. Parents were in the same age range as yours and he wasn't allowed to come out and play with any of the neighborhood kids. Maybe old fashioned thought or fear of somethoing happening to you, hard to say.\n\nBut hang in there it won't last forever and you will be an adult (legally).

You should be at least able to express your frustration without fear of punishment... or mom crying. At this point, I would definitely explore living with your brother. \n\nAlso, you are not responsible for your parents they should NOT be relying on you. You are supposed to be able to rely on them, but they continue to let you down. The fact that they are older is NOT an excuse.
