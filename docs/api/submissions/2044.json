NTA. \nNot sure if they are burnt out, but the age difference is for sure a reason for some of your problems.\nI can understand your parents might need help in the house, but this is no excuse to have you socially ostracized. In addition, if they are too old or sick to need additional care, one of your older siblings should be stepping up. Not you. You should be enjoying your teens. \nMy suggestion is to talk to them. Try to understand such a difference in treatment and explain how this is affecting you. No screams, no accusations. And try to find a common ground with them for getting more free time with some compromise from you. \nOnce you do it, you gave a fair try and should not feel guilty to move ahead. As much as is painful for a parent to see the kids go, children should be brought up to the world. Meaning that at one point, you will go have your life, like them or not. Better to try and have it in good terms. If this doesn\u2019t work, call your brother and ask if he can take you in.", "NTA. In one if your responses you said your parents rely on you.

Anything you leave behind, your parents can potentially use it to screw you over like opening bank accounts or debts under your name.", "NTA...at their age, why have another another child if they're just gonna treat you like a burden? You have every right to move out as soon as you can. You have no freedom and no support currently it seems like", "NTA. First off, your games are important, and an important part of your life! They should be there!! My kids used to get upset if I even considered even missing a practice! And you need a life outside of the home! For their peace of mind as well as yours. They laid the ground work for you when you were a little child, and you won't know how to succeed if you can't test your wings!!!", "NTA\nGet out of there quickly OP. This is neglect, it\u2019s not healthy and I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be putting it past the line to say that this is abuse. The fact that almost all your family members are calling you the AH makes me feel like this is a really weird sort of generational curse, since your siblings are the only ones defending you. It\u2019s a trap to make you feel like you\u2019re the problem when in reality, your parents are the problem.", "Definitely move out. NTA.\n\nYour parents are being unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nLive with a sibling immediately if you can.", "NTA, whoever calls you an AH ask them if they were cooking for their parents every night and never going out, or if they make their kids do this? No, then STFU and mind your own business. Stay out of my life since you aren't raising me. \nTell your mom if she wants you to stick around then she needs to ease up and give you some freedom, if not, as soon as you graduate from HS, will be out.", "Fly! Be free!", "NTA, for being as old as they are, it seems like they're trying to make you the one who takes care of them in their even older age. I'd tell them with their behavior towards you, they better talk to the other siblings about elderly care or find a good retirement home...\n\nEdit for autocorrect\n\nReddit 2- I hope to see this on r/BestOfRedditors to find out that you were able to GTFO. Good luck op.", "NTA, but better to plan to move out and be ready to do it before you tell them.", "NTA.  I think you\u2019re showing an admirable amount of restraint; had my parents pulled this kind of crap, I would have been on the phone with an attorney to find out my options with regards to emancipation.", "Either there is more to this story, or your parents are overbearing and insufferable. Either way, at 16 you are old enough to be emancipated and live on your own or with a family member.", "NTA. Your parents are abusing you. THEY are the parents. They shouldn\u2019t be making you cook every night. Some chores are normal but sounds like they make you do nearly everything. Move to your brothers. Who care if it \u201ccauses them issues\u201d. They can learn to cook and clean up after themselves.", "I agree they are burnt out but that\u2019s something you think about before having three kids. And then four kids. And then five kids. And then six kids. Geez, they\u2019re not birthing slaves.\n\nNTA and you should leave these manipulative users as soon as you can.", "As a parent, please move out- you\u2019ve been parentified", "That's not your problem, and it never should have been. Even if they really \"need\" you, then they shouldn't be treating you like a servant or an afterthought. They're robbing you of your teenhood and life to make their own lives easier. End that now. Take your brother's offer and run like the wind. You deserve way better than this.", "Say it with me OP. Your parents are not your responsibility and they should not be relying on their 16 year old daughter. Parents should not be dependent on their children. For your mental health I suggest getting into therapy and moving with your brother. You\u2019re 16 so there shouldn\u2019t be a big issue but I\u2019d have your brother look into things legally and make sure that your parents couldn\u2019t prevent you from leaving. \n\nIt honestly sounds like they had you to be their caregiver as they aged.", "You're not their caregiver, yet they've given you that unofficial role. Get out while you can!", "They have other adult children to rely on. Move in with your brother, live your life.", "Please move in with your brother. Your parents are robbing you of your childhood. They should be worrying about you and your needs not the other way around. If they need help they can hire a home health aid or get meal delivery services", "OP is a dude.\n\nThat aside, yeah. It's absolutely ridiculous that OP got punished for walking home in the dark because his parents forgot to pick him up.", "Hell I'm 74, live on a small farm and I can still carry 50# feedbags and take care of my barn by myself.", "seems to me that you're your parents retirement plan. They had you to care for them in their old age most likely.", "All of those things *are* normal. But so is being able to hang out with your friends. Your parents may be burnt out, but that\u2019s something they need to work on, not something you should have to fix.", "my dad's over 70 and is more help around the house than I am. your parents are taking advantage of you. please move in with your brother and live your own life.", "Your parents are lazy as shit, my dad is almost 10 years older than them and him and his wife live on the other side of the country taking care of themselves just fine and biking hiking and travelling constantly.", "NTA. Why do they need so much help? Are they unhealthy? They're certainly not that old.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re their retirement plan. Get out of there as quick as you can! And good luck!!", "NTA and grounded only solidified your decision. Move out.", "NTA, move in with your brother, maybe get emancipated.", "NTA. Why isn\u2019t your mom worried about upsetting you? Also, of course you\u2019re going to move out. That\u2019s what kids do.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve your own life", "NTA", "Go live with your brother. At 16, ok, it\u2019s fine if you cook once a week, maybe twice. But for the most part, YOU should be the dependent in that house. You definitely should not be missing out on a social life because you have to do things at home that your parents should do most of the time. You are a teenager. You should be the one who can rely on them for the most part, not vice versa. Your mom is manipulating you with the waterworks. Go live with your brother. Definitely, absolutely, NTA.", "NTA Leave. They're the ones wanting you yet they're not giving you the freedom a 16 year old needs, instead they're being entitled, authoritarian assholes. Leave now and let them learn how to adult by themselves.", "This sounds like them trying to guilt you into staying and becoming their permanent caretaker/maid/servant. \n\nAlso gives the vibe of \"well none of our retirement plans(your older siblings) work out, let's try 1 more time\" the fact none of them are on speaking terms with them should tell you it's a them problem.\n\nNTA", "They're not even old, both younger than I am, and I'm still working a highly physical job.", "Do your parents work? Are their other mental health issues with them? It doesn\u2019t sound healthy at all and I\u2019m sorry.  You should be allowed to be a teenager and do things.  Can you go live with your brother?", "Hope things go well for you, OP. It\u2019ll probably take time not to feel doubt or guilt, but don\u2019t hesitate to be selfish and put yourself first. You deserve it and you\u2019ve more than earned it.", "NTA   If you want your family on your side, make plans with them and then let your mom cancel them.", "NTA, but you also didn't gain anything by telling her of your plans.\n\nTalk to your siblings about helping you when you hit 18 to get out of your parent's house. Your parents are getting much too comfortable with a live-in maid and cook.", "They're 58 and 60, not 90 and 95.  They should be able to cook, clean, and do all the things their lives require.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the 12 year difference between you and your closest in age sibling, I wonder if you were either a surprise, or if they had you with intent of making you their servant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, and enjoy your freedom when you get it.", "NTA if they want a caretaker they can hire one, NOT birth one. It seems that is their intention with you. They want you to be their caretaker for their end of life care. They do not expect you to ever leave them, at least while they\u2019re alive. I\u2019d move in with a sibling and tell them to find caretaker because you are not giving up your life and your future to be built in hospice care for them.", "NTA \n\nIt is not your job to take care of your parents.  Agree with other posters it is their job to take care of you. \n\nIn your posts you aren\u2019t asking for anything unreasonable that a kid your age should be doing. \n\nAnd while helping around the house is good and also part of becoming independent it doesn\u2019t mean you do everything for everyone all the time.  Your parents are not that old (I\u2019m a fossil myself) and even if you were a late in life baby that is no reason IMO for them to be acting like they need to be cared for. And if they have serious health problems having their 16 year old child being their care giver is not the answer. \n\nPlease call your brother who offered to have you live with him and see if that is still possible. If so my suggestion is you take him up on the offer, let him know what the status of things are and ask him to please come get you.", "OP, please go live with your brother. I know it is extremely easy for me to just say this on the internet, but it will benefit you long term. You need to focus on yourself and your future. \n\nYour parents have literally parentified you and infantilized themselves. Get away and refuse to engage with the bs", "You are 16 they are 58 and 60. Fully grown adults. They were fine taking care of themselves before they had kids and will be fine after you go. You are not their caretaker and you are being drained, I would be unsurprised if this is why your brother doesn\u2019t like your parents.", "I\u2019m 70 - your parents are young.  There is no reason they can\u2019t take of themselves.  I bowl a couple times a week.  Husband is older than me and has many health issues - he still takes care of our property.  Get out, they don\u2019t need you - they want you as personal houseboy! Run run run to your brother.", "Well said.", "I\u2019m sorry but living on a chill farm sounds like a dream", "NTA\nCan you go live with one of your siblings? That might be your best bet. Your parents are apparently done parenting and instead want to treat you like a maid. If you have to stay, start saving for the day you turn 18. Maybe talk to your siblings about staying with them then. Make plans. And then you can never speak to your parents again.", "NTA your a older teen and social stuff is important to your mental growth. You moving out as soon as you can is what you are supposed to do. I wonder if since they are elderly they expected you to never move out and just take care of them and everything around the house until they pass? I dunno. They seem off tho.", "NTA you\u2019re a child not a maid or chef. Move in with your brother. They can fend for themselves they aren\u2019t old. They just want you to do it all for them which sounds lazy in my opinion.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey shouldn't be relying on you, they're the parents, it's their responsibility\n\nGo stay with your brother and live your life", "Info:  are your parents physically disabled or is there some other condition or situation that means they rely on you for help?\n\n(not that they should, but I am wondering what's going on here)", "NTA, OP, but they are not your responsibility, and it\u2019ll never be easier feeling like you let your mom down (I\u2019m over 30 and still feel bad not going along with my mom\u2019s plan for my life).  If living with bro helps you, do it.", "They will actually cope just fine without you.  Once the imaginary weight of being responsible for a child is lifted, they will get a second wind of energy as all empty nesters get, and they will be easily able to cope alone.\n\nIn the long run it will probably do you and them good if you live with your brother  You can do it without too much long term drama.", "Nta and judging by the age gap it either a oops baby or a planned so they have help in the house as they was rotten to all other siblings", "go live with your brother , they are exploiting you", "NTA, your parents are abusive, neglectful, and very controlling. They are able to just skate by with this because they are still providing for. However, forcing you to stay home to take care of them is abusive, as well as child labor laws. What you are being forced to do is beyond the realm of chores. I am sure it has been ingrained in you that you will take care of parents the rest of thir lives, and you better obey mother and father above all or else. You sound like a responsible, dependable, and intelligent young man. If you are in the US bare in mind that in a lot of states you are old enough to tell a judge who you would like to live with. Your parents are being incredibly unreasonable with their demands of you. Yes they are your parents and you love them but you shouldt be expected to take care of 2 grown adults because they are to lazy and checked out. Sometimes you have love your self more than your love is not reciprocated, they can't even be bothered to pick you up from school. The fact that your parents expected and demand their 16 your old child to do more for their parents than the parents are willing to do for themselves or for their own child is disgusting. Your brother sounds like real support system for you lean on him. And the family is who siding with parents are just as disgusting for condoning and gaslighting you can go suck an egg. I caution you to be very secretive as to what your plans or moving forward. Also and saddens me to say but your parents are probably going to get worse. In my eperience working with families in similar situations, things tend to get way worse before it gets better. I hope and pray this is not what happens in case. They now know your plans do not align with their plans for you. Some behaviors you might see but I hope your parents wise up first; are parents are going to try to manipulate you, isolate you even more from the outside world. They are along with other members of your family are going to do all the toxic tactics on you. They are already trying make you more dependent on them so you won't try to leave. They will try to make you think you are nothing without them and they will most likely sabotage any attempts at independence. see if you can get a hold of your personal documents like your ID, birth certificate, passport etc. If they refuse order your documents to be mailed to your brothers house. Maybe see if your brother will assist you in opening a checking account. I know it seems like a lot and your hiding info from your parents, but think of it as you a getting a jump start with your independent living skills. I hope your parents see past themselves and starting treating you better before they wonder why they have no relationship with you. I wish you the very best and I pray your situation gets better ASAP.", "NTA\n\nOP, your parents sound like bad parents, being \"too tired\" is understandable, but it is not your fault. also, what kind of parent does not attend at least one game for their children? \n\nAlso, they should not be relying on you, you're a 16 year old, I agree, you should move out and live your own life.", "NTA at all, your parents are treating you like shit. Maybe they\u2019ve got their own issues going on, who knows. But that doesn\u2019t excuse what they\u2019re saying and doing to you. Make a plan for what your route out is - maybe ask your older siblings for help?", "NTA. I wonder, is the brother offering a home by chance the oldest? Who wasn't allowed a social life because the parents needed his \"help\" with the younger siblings.", "NTA and since I saw your comments go and live with your brother", "NTA. It's not your fault your parents are narcissists", "No nothing that I know of. Think there\u2019s definitely something wrong with them but not medical", "They won\u2019t go because my brother is the coach. They say the sport ruined him. Think it\u2019s because he had to move away because he got a scholarship. They are quite bitter about it. My sister has told me they never let her play any type of sports after my brother got good at hockey", "Yes it is my oldest brother. I\u2019ve always been closest to him. I think he has a lot of issues with our parents but he doesn\u2019t discuss them with me. My sister says that there is a lot they could tell me but it\u2019s not right to influence me in any way but I don\u2019t really understand what she means by that.", "They don't want to influence your relationship with your parents. They have obviously had horrible abusive experiences like you but they don't want you to hate your parents because they were treated badly. They don't want to be the reason you dislike your parents, that has to be your own decision based on your own experience and not their influence. It's very good of them, that alone shows how much better people they are than your asshole parents. They put you and your well-being first, your selfish asshole parents put themselves first. I hope you go live with your siblings and never let those assholes you got stuck with for parents guilt you into anything. One day you will realize they stole your childhood and nothing can make up for that."]}
