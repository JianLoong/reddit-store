Your SIL made terrible accusations during a time when her mental health was questionable. I\u2019m just not sure how an ED and being bipolar are related to her accusations.

If SIL is normally managing her disorder with medications, she may have had to stop after getting pregnant depending on the meds because some can cause birth defects. Also, hormones from pregnancy can cause wild mood swings in neurotypical women, so you can imagine how it might impact someone who already has a mood disorder. Also \u201cchose to get pregnant again\u201d maybe she feels pressure from her husband to have another child, maybe she feels having a family is worth sacrificing her mental health for 9 months, maybe she doesn\u2019t take hormonal birth control because it exacerbates her bipolar and she got pregnant on accident but couldn\u2019t bring herself to abort. Is it a decision I would make? nope. But you can\u2019t just say that she \u201cchose\u201d to get pregnant again when you don\u2019t know the circumstances.", "Eating disorder", "I'm bipolar and while I've (thankfully) never reached the psychosis side of mania, it's still a miserable experience in any form/severity. \n\nMy latest episode resulted in my impulse control going completely out the window I spent myself into a pit while mentally fighting myself to stop and at one point I called my mom crying at 3am because I'd been up for 2 days and just wanted to feel stable again. It was triggered by forgetting to take my meds for a week after 2 difficult medical procedures and my dog almost dying. I'm just now starting to stabilize after about a month of being back on my meds. I've never accused anyone of anything but I have had an ex-friend who was also bipolar get straight up venomous with me for trying to help her, then she called several people and laughed about it right in front of me, later claiming it was due to mania. \n\nI can attest to it feeling like being trapped in your mind while your body is forcing you to roll with whatever impulsive shit is running through your head, but people can also just be assholes who happen to be bipolar.", "That did not even cross my mind.. Lol", "NTA.  Sounds like she made up a story of how you caused her to stop eating as a cover for her eating disorder.  It's fully understandable why you wouldn't want to be around two people you clearly can't trust with your safety.", "He's got some nerve throwing the word \"monster\" around, sin ce he's married to one..\n\nThe question is how he could believe what SIL was saying, as he knew you both.\n\nYou were not like the picture SIL made of you. And SIL can't have been a joy forever, if she's capable of these lies out of nowhere..\n\nNever forgive them. Let there be a rift in this family forever because of her and of him.\n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nConsidering she HAS apologized and she was legitimately have a very real psychotic break at the time.....you unfortunately come across as the asshole here. \n\nI was all set to side with you and rage that how dare they try to gloss this over! ....but then you said she has apologized to you directly multiple times, felt genuine remorse, gotten a handle on the cause of the mental break by getting a diagnosis and help, made up with others harmed (your parents), and has suffered consequences. \n\nAt this point, you are being an asshole. And yes, you are heading towards monster territory if the stress you are *purposely making* over this causes the thread of her mental health to snap again. \n\nIf you can't get back to positive, which anyone would understand, you at least need to aim for neutral civility. You should be able to attend the same holiday dinner without drama, for example or be in the same room without waterworks and cussing. \n\nYou've been given a pass and a lot of leeway in the past because of your bad experience with your ex, but you might find that expiring if you cause the mentally fragile pregnant lady, or by association, her baby, harm. So knock it off, declare an armistice, and be socially polite.", "ESH. Your brother believed his wife, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. She didn\u2019t have her diagnosis yet so I feel like you really can\u2019t be upset at him for the anger or believing her. I would hope my husband would defend me if something like that was truly happening, so defending his wife and removing her from the situation, even though it was fabricated, was not a bad move. Threatening to call your ex was an AH move though. After the diagnosis and presumed treatment, and also her attempting to make amends, you still treating her like crap makes you the AH. While mental illness does not give anyone the right to treat anyone else poorly, it explains the situation. It sounds like it was one incident with you, and then a ton of apologies. Was it a major incident? Yes. But continuing to be hateful over something that she may not of had control over feels petty. I\u2019m not saying you need to be her friend, but treating her poorly or intentionally making her uncomfortable is shitty.", "NTA and it doesn't sound like your brother even apologized to you. And he doesn't have mental health issues.", "NTA. You do not have to put up with her or her BS.", "NTA. Just because someone has apologized does not automatically mean u have to forgive them. Issue here seems to b, we feel guilty and can't stand that we feel guilty. But on the other hand, I don't c that ur brother in particular has changed much. Im all for supporting ur SO/spouse, but im also all for being objective and questioning if something seems off, like what ur SIL claimed u said/did vs the person ur brother should know u r. So until they make a real effort to deal with their shit, an apology is gonna feel pretty empty and hollow for u.", "Agree.\nOP, declining to forgive two people who treated you horribly during your *and your children\u2019s* darkest hour is not abuse. Its consequences.\nThey literally put you *and your children* on the street. I mean, yeah, your parents took you right in off the street, but how terrifying was that?\nI\u2019m loath to throw stones at your SIL because mental illness sucks. I\u2019m not an expert; maybe she really didn\u2019t know what she was doing was wrong. But it still hurt you and your kids dreadfully. And *you* don\u2019t have to have anything to do with her.", "I also worry for their kids", "SIL has apologized a \"hundred\" times to the OP. She has also made up with her inlaws, and her now having a diagnosis implies she's gotten professional help. So yes, she has been making an effort with positive results and has also apologized.", "It's clearly YTA, and a swear 2 years ago the responses would have been all YTA, but I don't know what the heck demographic uses this group any more.  You shoulda seen that one a few days ago where several thousand people were telling a boy he has to let a girl touch him if she wants to!\n\nAnyway just thought I'd support you for being voice of reason :)", "Sil used OP as a scapegoat to hide her ED and brother tried to retraumatize her after evicting her from the house. Op has plenty of reason to never ever forgive. Especially if they keep trying to get back in her good graces with lip service. If they wanted to get back into her good graces, they\u2019d not push for reconciliation until OP decides she wants to reconcile.\n\nYou can\u2019t be upset for brother\u2019s anger or believing his wife, but you* can* for being threatened with being returned to an abusive household and sudden homelessness for both you *and your children*. Just because the parents stepped up and believed op doesn\u2019t mean they always would have and that could have gone very sour for her very quickly. \n\nI have a narc parent who would happily have thrown me under the bus for a lark without even thinking about it and he for sure poisoned the well with his family involving my mother with him saying how horribly and dangerously abusive she was. Though, to be fair, she did end up being mildly abusive, but at least she only hit me across the face and yelled about how incompetent she believed me to be. He was much worse.", "Not really. Apologetic words mean nothing. They are words. Yet look at the actions. They don\u2019t match the words. \n\nOP no longer trusts SIL (for good reason) yet SIL keeps trying to force herself back into OPs life. So SIL is **still** violating boundaries, just in a new way. So much for restoring trust!\n\nIn short, neither brother or SIL have made efforts to restore what happened. \n\nIf they want to make things right then they first need to honor the time out that OP gave them. Maybe then there will be enough trust to begin talking again."]}
