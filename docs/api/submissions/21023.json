I'm just now starting to stabilize after about a month of being back on my meds.

Threatening to call your ex was an AH move though. After the diagnosis and presumed treatment, and also her attempting to make amends, you still treating her like crap makes you the AH. While mental illness does not give anyone the right to treat anyone else poorly, it explains the situation. It sounds like it was one incident with you, and then a ton of apologies.

I think he's malicious. He tried to ruin OP's life based on a confrontation he didn't witness, and if not for others being aware enough to realize OP would never do anything like what she was accused of, OP would probably be back in an abusive situation or worse. \n\nLet's say for a moment, OP actually did what she was accused of. How is it worse than what SIL is doing? I mean, if it's ok in brother's mind for SIL to make up lies about everyone to the point she burned her whole life down because she has mental health issues, why is it wrong in his mind for OP to say horrible things because she's dealing with trauma? At worst, those two situations should be on equal footing. SIL is treated with such kid gloves that he thinks it's abusive to not forgive her. Yet, when he believed OP said that stuff, he tried to destroy her life. The only conclusion I think to draw is that he's going to defend his wife at all costs in all ways, and if anyone stands in the way of that he's going to ruin them, whether his wife is right or wrong.", "I\u2019m worried for the innocent kids.

Even if we gave SIL a pass for the mental health aspect, what's his excuse?", "Exactly, even if hypothetically they made good points that mean OP should forgive SIL (and I'm in no way saying that's true), brother had no mental illness and threatened horrible things to OP based on false accusations. He has no excuse, and he's acting like the whole thing should be forgiven because he was mistaken. It's like, it doesn't change the fact that he tried to ruin OP's life.

I'm surprised you are still talking to your brother. An apology doesn't mean SIL gets to be anywhere in your orbit, mental illness or not. I'm glad you and your kids are safe now.", "NTA.   \nI've being battling depression for decades which brings on moods swings and I'm telling you I don't expect people to forgive me if I have a go at them.  \n(Similar though, if they made my life even worse they're dead to me and I digress a little).  \nBut thats the point. Damage done, You don't owe her jack especially the way they BOTH acted in your hour of need.  \nIf You CHOOSE to forgive, just be aware you're dealing with a gaslighting so and so cause I know one when I see one.", "No you are not doing to her mentally what your ex did to you. You were the victim of your ex's behaviour. You will not engage with a woman who lied about you and kicked you out when you were vulnerable.  You were also the victim of your SIL. And now you have decided to stand up to people who mentally abuse you.\n\nWhat I would say is that your SIL's behaviour appears to have been the result of mental illness. Perhaps you can find it in you if that is the case and she is genuinely sorry, if not to forgive her (which is your choice) but to make a peace with how badly she behaved. \n\nNTA", "I agree that the brother is the real problem  at this point. OP isn't the asshole to refuse to forgive people who treated her cruelly when she was in a vulnerable position; she isn't a very kind person either, if she is still treating her sister-in-law, who was ill and has apparently apologized repeatedly, with such contempt. You can refuse to wholly forgive someone, while acknowledging their struggles and being civil to them. The brother who threatened to turn OP over to their abuser, tried to turn their family against them and is acting entitled and accusatory now is definitely an asshole.", "your brother needs to look in the mirror. nta.", "Raise gremlins or traumatise innocent kids", "But where is the brother\u2019s apology? OP says SIL apologized but doesn\u2019t mention brother apologizing or even acknowledging the harm done. In fact, it sounds like the brother was dismissive of the hurt HE caused (he focuses on forgiving SIL but nothing about his own rage and threats to call OP\u2019s ex). \n\nIf the brother is dismissing what happened and hasn\u2019t apologized for his role, then I can see how OP doesn\u2019t take the apologies from SIL seriously- after all, the real hurt here was from the brother\u2019s words/actions, even if SIL instigated it with her mental illness.\n\nAnd if this dismissiveness has been going on for THREE years, I can see why OP snapped at SIL and cursed. \n\nAlso again with the brother- I find it hypocritical to be concerned about SIL + SIL\u2019s unborn child\u2019s welfare when the brother put OP + OP\u2019s two children\u2019s welfare at risk by 1) throwing them out and 2) threatening to call OP\u2019s ex.", "Exactly. Even if the OP really had said those things, you don't threaten to get someone's abuser to come along and mete out justice to them like some sort of hired goon. What the hell.", "They should have learned about birth control before this new pregnancy, considering the fallout from the last one. As you say, they aren't going to make great parents.", "Wait until the kids are old enough, he'll be tearing apart his own children based on his wife's word. I was this child. This has me all messed up.\n\nHey OP, if you can do me a solid, you don't have to forgive either of these adults, but don't frost the kids out. They will need family support to survive enough mentally. Growing up, I always had one adult who showed me kindness and compassion. Wasn't the same adult, because the toxicity pushed everyone away eventually", "All this and also just to note psychosis is not just limited to mania. You can also experience psychotic depression in bipolar disorder (and anyone can also have this at any time). People often equate bipolar psychosis with an elevated mood, thinking it therefore \u2018doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019 for her to throw out negative accusations due to her bipolar. But mania can also make you very paranoid, or you could have psychotic depression which is psychosis and deflated mood, meaning you are more likely to be both negatively perceiving the world and psychotic (so disconnected from reality).\n\nAlso yes, saying she \u2018chose to get pregnant again\u2019 as if she shouldn\u2019t because she knows she has a mental health disorder is very ignorant and stigmatising. You can be medicated for bipolar disorder through pregnancy - for example, lithium can be taken if it is monitored during pregnancy. She could simply have made the decision for herself to have another baby, and she shouldn\u2019t be judged for that. Of course her mental health is taking another dip but without being privy to her treatment plan or anything else, none of us can judge whether that is a good or bad decision for her.\n\nI personally have severe mental health disorders and still want to have a baby. I can be medicated throughout my pregnancy but yes, it probably will impact my mood terribly. I am high risk for issues due to my history of severe mental illness and also the fact my maternal grandmother had postpartum psychosis. This does not mean I should not make the choice to have a baby. I am well informed of my treatment options and will be monitored closely by my GP, CPN and psychiatric team as soon as I get pregnant.\n\nOP/this commenter do not know the details of her treatment or agreement with her mental health providers whilst she is pregnant. To throw out shitty comments like this just adds to the stigma of people struggling with mental health disorders. Mental illness can strike at any time, pregnant or not, and for some people it\u2019s a lifelong disability. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make choices about our lives and doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the \u2018wrong decision\u2019, even if uninformed judgemental people would look at it so. Again, without knowing her treatment plan and her safeguarding, none of us here (including OP) can judge her for having another baby.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP experienced this from their SIL. OP does not have to forgive or move on. SIL has to live with the consequences of their actions, mental illness or not, just like we all do who struggle. But the idea that she is a bad person because she\u2019s choosing to have a second child or that her bipolar disorder \u2018didn\u2019t cause\u2019 her original actions is just fucking ignorant and adds to stigma.", "Link?"]}
