How is it worse than what SIL is doing? I mean, if it's ok in brother's mind for SIL to make up lies about everyone to the point she burned her whole life down because she has mental health issues, why is it wrong in his mind for OP to say horrible things because she's dealing with trauma? At worst, those two situations should be on equal footing. SIL is treated with such kid gloves that he thinks it's abusive to not forgive her. Yet, when he believed OP said that stuff, he tried to destroy her life. The only conclusion I think to draw is that he's going to defend his wife at all costs in all ways, and if anyone stands in the way of that he's going to ruin them, whether his wife is right or wrong.", "I\u2019m worried for the innocent kids.

He has no excuse, and he's acting like the whole thing should be forgiven because he was mistaken. It's like, it doesn't change the fact that he tried to ruin OP's life.

You can also experience psychotic depression in bipolar disorder (and anyone can also have this at any time). People often equate bipolar psychosis with an elevated mood, thinking it therefore \u2018doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019 for her to throw out negative accusations due to her bipolar. But mania can also make you very paranoid, or you could have psychotic depression which is psychosis and deflated mood, meaning you are more likely to be both negatively perceiving the world and psychotic (so disconnected from reality).\n\nAlso yes, saying she \u2018chose to get pregnant again\u2019 as if she shouldn\u2019t because she knows she has a mental health disorder is very ignorant and stigmatising. You can be medicated for bipolar disorder through pregnancy - for example, lithium can be taken if it is monitored during pregnancy. She could simply have made the decision for herself to have another baby, and she shouldn\u2019t be judged for that. Of course her mental health is taking another dip but without being privy to her treatment plan or anything else, none of us can judge whether that is a good or bad decision for her.\n\nI personally have severe mental health disorders and still want to have a baby. I can be medicated throughout my pregnancy but yes, it probably will impact my mood terribly. I am high risk for issues due to my history of severe mental illness and also the fact my maternal grandmother had postpartum psychosis. This does not mean I should not make the choice to have a baby. I am well informed of my treatment options and will be monitored closely by my GP, CPN and psychiatric team as soon as I get pregnant.\n\nOP/this commenter do not know the details of her treatment or agreement with her mental health providers whilst she is pregnant. To throw out shitty comments like this just adds to the stigma of people struggling with mental health disorders. Mental illness can strike at any time, pregnant or not, and for some people it\u2019s a lifelong disability.

Again, without knowing her treatment plan and her safeguarding, none of us here (including OP) can judge her for having another baby.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP experienced this from their SIL. OP does not have to forgive or move on. SIL has to live with the consequences of their actions, mental illness or not, just like we all do who struggle.

She lied and made up shit\u2026 pregnant or not she is TA in this story.", "They threw you out of the house with no warning during a time of great vulnerability for you and your kids. Those are aggravating circumstances. How disruptive for your poor kids. This cannot be fixed with a simple apology. NTA", "He\u2019s using the best underhanded jab he can think of to try and guilt you into doing what he wants. Don\u2019t give in, you are NTA here. Comparing you to your abusive ex was fucking low. I\u2019d continue with low contact with the bro and none with that SIL if I were you.", "NTA, you SIL is clearly a massive problem. Mental illness does not excuse the damage that she\u2019s caused. Your brother is another major problem. He\u2019s an enabler and an A H for threatening to call your ex. \n\nI would stay NC with both of them after what they put you and your children through.", "NTA\n\nShe apologized, which is lovely, but an apology doesn't mean you have to forgive anything. \n\nAll I recommend you do is be minimally polite whenever you find yourself in the same place as your brother and sil. In other words, speak only when you can't avoid it and don't let them draw you into conversations you don't want or arguments that will interfere with other people's peace. They will not be comfortable with this, but that's their problem, not yours. \n\nI'm not going to lie, it's not easy. It took a lot of practice for me to get to the \"cold polite\" stage with my ex, but our drama can't be allowed to take over the rest of the family.", "NTA\n\nTbh I would lean towards extending some grace to your SIL and be try to be civil to her if not forgiving re her actions during a MH breakdown since has acknowledged the problem and apologised. But your brother can fuck off indeed and is not the person to be preaching about forgiveness when he is going around threating you with your abuser and drawing comparisons between the two.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHaving mental issues doesn't require forgiveness.\n\nFrom, a mentally ill woman who has had to accept she pushed away many friends.", "NTA. She literally kicked you out of her house on false pretences and she is the one feeling 'unwelcome'. You are not doing anything to her. They are the ones coming after you again. You are just trying to keep distance between them. Despite the fact she is his wife, your brother should show some respect for you too. He is the one treating you the same way your ex treated you. Putting blame at you that is not yours and trying to tear you down.", "Fuck him. He's got some fucking nerve to try to equate you distancing yourself from his lying shit of a wife to the abuse you suffered.\nNTA.", "Actually, forgiveness is a gift.", "Yes, and it can get worse with each pregnancy.\n\nI wonder if anyone remembers Andrea Yates.", "Right I think we are missing some details\u2026.", "Totally inexcusable", "And for this they can keep on fucking off. He threatened her with her abusive ex. His own sister!!! and now he can and should fuck all the way off. Keep on fucking off assholes.", "an apology means nothing on its own, and people don\u2019t have to accept apologies just because they\u2019re offered. the fact that the sil kept trying to apologize a hundred times means that she is still trying to make the situation about herself and her feelings rather than respecting that op doesn\u2019t want to rebuild ties with her.", "None of the things you mention cause a person to lie though. Even very bad depression,.mood swings, psychosis even do not cause a person to lie intentionally, which is what happened. Lying is caused by a character flaw, and is exacerbated by mental illnesses, which in her Sail's case is most likely borderline personality disorder which I'm guessing due to the attention seeking behaviour, eating disorder (very common among BPD sufferers) and unpredictability.", "What reason? That you have to forgive people simply for apologizing?", "Some things are relationship killers.", "It's also not contagious.  Brother has no excuse for his behavior", "My partner has suffered from a bipolar induced psychosis. I actually believe it is likely SIL 100% believed what she said to be true. Of course it didn\u2019t happen but in the midst of psychosis she couldn\u2019t tell the difference. \n\nOPs brother though, is just an asshole. Getting someone who suffered from psychosis while pregnant, pregnant again is just not okay. It is honestly raising red flags galore to me.", "Do not feel for thr brother. He is an abuser.", "I'd say she's already there with the mental illness. Less obviously so because OP is actually not forgiving her SIL, as opposed to the made up insults of the last incident. But SIL is already having a breakdown. She's blaming OPs lack of forgiveness on her feelings of alienation from her in-laws. I doubt that they'd all be fine with SIL and brother if OP says she forgives them. \n\n\n\nIt doesn't sound like SILs mental health has ever gotten better. Which is on OPs brother for a large part, but it's also a bit on her.", "Ok. Do he kicks her out and cuts off contract\u2026 \n\nBut removes the support system from his niblings?  \n\nThreatens to call her ABUSER and tell him where they are and that they are homeless??\n\nStill, years later, compares her to an ABUSER\u2026 even when he knows him and his wife were in the wrong???\n\nNo. That\u2019s not \u201cThe truth as he knew it\u201d That\u2019s vindictive, cruel, scorched earth.", "There's no way the brother didn't notice any behavior changes in his wife living day in and day out with her.  There were definite signs leading up to that incident that brother didn't catch. Whether he chalked it up to pregnancy hormones that i cant say.", "I had mild post-partum psychosis with my recent baby. By the time she was a week and a half old, i wouldn\u2019t let anyone near her, i didn\u2019t sleep, i didn\u2019t eat, i just guarded my baby from the hallucinations that i thought were coming to take her from me. She had an appointment for her jaundice and i screamed \u201cplease give her back i\u2019m so sorry im trying so hard, please don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d and the nurse was like \u201cthis isn\u2019t good\u201d\n\nlong story longer they called my doctor who sent in a two week course of antidepressants and lorazepam and told my husband i WOULD be sleeping whenever he was home if he wanted the hallucinations and erratic behaviour to stop.", "I had mild post-partum psychosis with my recent baby.

I would fear for the safety of that child. And then to impregnate her again while knowing how extreme her behavior was before. Brother seems to be having some issues himself.", "Why is SIL pregnant again? Well, maybe to corner OP into forgiving her because she's pregnant and so vulnerable. And then after reconciliation she will wait a week, like always, and then Start round two of accusations.\n\n/ s", "Exactly what I said. Her husband takes every word his wife says literally and escalates the situation, even after he's aware of her pregnancy induced mental health issues. The first pregnancy he kicked OP out and threatened to contact her ex. This pregnancy wife's obsessing over OP's forgiveness and her husband is telling OP she's turned into her ex to pressure OP into pleasing his wife.\n\nThe brother is way more the issue here. I don't know if it's hatred for his sister or denial over his wife's condition. But he's always escalating or enabling her to escalate a situation.", "Brother certainly sounds as if he's a bully to OP. Who knows what goes on behind closed doors. I think that might be a Country and Western song, sorry.", "That sounds horrendous. It sounds like it was diagnosed promptly and got sorted. It's a fraught time, post partum.", "After SIL insisted (!) she should come and not go to her parents. I know mental health is real, but honestly that sounds like a trap to me.", "If the shoe fits, he seems like a jackass at the very least.", "It's an odd thing for someone struggling with mental health. But the husband sounds quite controlling so might have engineered that.", ">If the shoe fits\n\nBuy a pair in every colour?", "Jackals and/or bully. Probably and.", "! Jackass! Autocorrect went mad."]}
