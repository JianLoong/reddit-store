How is it worse than what SIL is doing? I mean, if it's ok in brother's mind for SIL to make up lies about everyone to the point she burned her whole life down because she has mental health issues, why is it wrong in his mind for OP to say horrible things because she's dealing with trauma? At worst, those two situations should be on equal footing. SIL is treated with such kid gloves that he thinks it's abusive to not forgive her. Yet, when he believed OP said that stuff, he tried to destroy her life. The only conclusion I think to draw is that he's going to defend his wife at all costs in all ways, and if anyone stands in the way of that he's going to ruin them, whether his wife is right or wrong.", "I\u2019m worried for the innocent kids.

He has no excuse, and he's acting like the whole thing should be forgiven because he was mistaken. It's like, it doesn't change the fact that he tried to ruin OP's life.

You can also experience psychotic depression in bipolar disorder (and anyone can also have this at any time). People often equate bipolar psychosis with an elevated mood, thinking it therefore \u2018doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019 for her to throw out negative accusations due to her bipolar. But mania can also make you very paranoid, or you could have psychotic depression which is psychosis and deflated mood, meaning you are more likely to be both negatively perceiving the world and psychotic (so disconnected from reality).\n\nAlso yes, saying she \u2018chose to get pregnant again\u2019 as if she shouldn\u2019t because she knows she has a mental health disorder is very ignorant and stigmatising. You can be medicated for bipolar disorder through pregnancy - for example, lithium can be taken if it is monitored during pregnancy. She could simply have made the decision for herself to have another baby, and she shouldn\u2019t be judged for that. Of course her mental health is taking another dip but without being privy to her treatment plan or anything else, none of us can judge whether that is a good or bad decision for her.\n\nI personally have severe mental health disorders and still want to have a baby. I can be medicated throughout my pregnancy but yes, it probably will impact my mood terribly. I am high risk for issues due to my history of severe mental illness and also the fact my maternal grandmother had postpartum psychosis. This does not mean I should not make the choice to have a baby. I am well informed of my treatment options and will be monitored closely by my GP, CPN and psychiatric team as soon as I get pregnant.\n\nOP/this commenter do not know the details of her treatment or agreement with her mental health providers whilst she is pregnant. To throw out shitty comments like this just adds to the stigma of people struggling with mental health disorders. Mental illness can strike at any time, pregnant or not, and for some people it\u2019s a lifelong disability.

Again, without knowing her treatment plan and her safeguarding, none of us here (including OP) can judge her for having another baby.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP experienced this from their SIL. OP does not have to forgive or move on. SIL has to live with the consequences of their actions, mental illness or not, just like we all do who struggle.

Your SIL owes you an actual apology, and no more of the self victimization. Her lies caused you harm, and you have every right to be angry and avoid her without her guilt tripping water works. Your brothers just a straight up dick who should feel ashamed of himself.", "A core tenet of being worthy of forgiveness is *not expecting it*. Holding yourself accountable with no expectation of anything from the person you harmed. If you can\u2019t do that, you haven\u2019t learned. I say this as a deeply neurodivergent person who did things I regret before I was properly medicated. \n\nThey aren\u2019t sorry in a way that\u2019s meaningful, they don\u2019t get it. Threatening to call your ex whether he meant it or not was a *horrifying* betrayal. And us mentally ill folks still are responsible for the things we do during episodes once we are present again. SIL needs to grapple with that and come to terms with it. What was done to you was horrid and you have every right to feel the way you do.

This guy is toxic and doesn't give a sh*t about you.\n\nYou grows up together, share half of your life and this is how he treats you? Not taking the time to let you explain? Threatening you with your abusive ex? Dissmiss your feemings? Emotionally manipulate you with your toxic ex? F*ck him.\n\n>she accused multiple people of saying cruel which even cost her job and a lot of friends\n\nIs this before or after the event? Did your \"brother\" knew? Because that destroys the potential explanation \"he was so angry he couldn't think\". If he knew his wife did that regularly in the past, then he's even more an AH.\n\nNTA and cut contact with him.", "NTA, let\u2019s recap\nOP brother listened to his wife\u2019s complaints that made no sense because it was not like you and just went ahead and believed her. Did not ask you questions.\nThen gathers all your stuff and tosses it out\nThreatens to call the ABUSIVE ex and cause trouble for you. This right here is go NC worthy! \nTried to turn the family against you, thank goodness you have a good family. \nFinds out his wife has psychological issues and just wants to sweep everything under the rug. Then continues to attack you!\nIn my opinion you should forgive SIL, it\u2019s your brother who owes you a MASSIVE apology, on his knees! He really did you wrong. No apology then I would go no contact with him.", "NTA, and apology means absolutely nothing without a change in behavior, and as best I can tell you haven't asked for an apology.\n         \nBut if she does it again, it would be great if you could restrain the eye roll, and tell her: \"you don't need to keep apologizing. I am not ever getting over what you did no matter what words come out of your mouth because it's not about what you 'say,' it's about what you do.\"", "Recently diagnosed bipolar and agree that she isn't owed acceptance of the apology for what she's done but the comments calling her a monster and what kind of mother she'll be are why I'm so afraid of this diagnosis. I'm a mother and while I've never reached psychosis I couldn't imagine people feeling I'm undeserving of my children because I am mentally unwell (although medicated now that I know WHY I am the way I am)", ">she isn't a very kind person either, if she is still treating her sister-in-law, who was ill and has apparently apologized repeatedly, with such contempt. You can refuse to wholly forgive someone, while acknowledging their struggles and being civil to them.\n\nThat's a bit naive... Sometimes, the damages are so big that you will never be able to fix them. The relationship will always be tense and cold no matter. And pressing the apology just destroy even more.", "I agree she\u2019s not a monster, she\u2019s mentally Ill. And I agree she isn\u2019t undeserving of her child.", "Who cares what SIL believed though?\n\nEven *if* you believe that it was due to mental illness -- and I'm skeptical, since pregnancy is claimed to be a trigger for some pretty awful things and oh wait, she's preggers again, so hmmmmm -- OP is being perfectly reasonable to never want a single thing to do with her again.", "I understand why they're defensive. We can't say whether they're fit to be a parent, but it's a touchy subject for sure. My mother was severely mentally ill, and that's exactly why I developed my own very bad borderline. I think I'm getting better, but I would never trust myself raising a child. Some people aren't able to make that call.", "Are you saying that like you think I don\u2019t realise that? Lmao because I do. Obviously. Having lived with severe mental illness since I was 15. However, as stated, unless you know somebody else\u2019s treatment plan, support network and safeguarding, you can make absolutely 0 judgement on their decision to have a baby.\n\nEdit - as if this is being downvoted. You all think someone who is bipolar should not have children? Or don\u2019t understand that medications can be changed and effective treatment plans be put into place between pregnancies? You really think you can judge someone\u2019s \u2018acceptability\u2019 of having children based on a diagnosis when you aren\u2019t privy to their current medications, treatment or stability?\n\nYou are all ignorant af people. Who are probably too dumb to even realise their own ignorance.", "It doesn't matter if she believed what she said or what the intent of her actions were.\n\nShe acted.\n\nShe made the accusations, threw her SIL out, and now here are the consequences of those actions. Period.\n\nHer husband went along with everything and here are the consequences of his actions. Period.\n\nUndiagnosed mental illness, untreated mental illness, treated mental illness, pregnancy, asking for forgiveness, none of those things entitles those two to forgiveness.\n\nThey abused OP, and now they are reaping the repercussions of their treatment of her. \n\nThey can both go to therapy to work out their feelings on the matter from this point out.  They need to leave OP the fuck alone like she has told them to.", "My thoughts exactly. I have diagnosed PTSD/depression/generalized anxiety due to being a survivor of violent crime. That being said, if I screw up, it's on me to make it right. It sounds like SIL tried and it's completely understandable why OP doesn't wish to accept her apology.\n\nHowever, what the brother said about contacting the abusive ex is completely inexcusable and I'd have an easier time forgiving SIL and not the brother. \n\nThis whole dynamic sounds toxic AF.", "I have bipolar and I was only diagnosed after having a psychotic episode with extreme paranoia. She could have had the same issue.", "Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't people with bipolar disorder typically have to go off medication when pregnant and possibly while breastfeeding? That could be a reason for why her episodes have lasted so long. If I were the husband, I would be incredibly cautious about having another pregnancy with her for that reason alone....If going off her meds messes with her that bad, I don't think having more biological children is a good idea.", "Where did I say OP needs to forgive her? Pregnancy hormones can and do cause psychosis. This is documented and real. It can explain her behavior. \n\nReproductive coercion is a thing. OPs brother has a lot of red flags surrounding his behavior. The way he threatened to call OPs abuser is disgusting and he is the real problem here. Should SIL go through with the pregnancy, definitely not. Most psychs and gynos would advise against it, mainly because if she already experienced psychosis it is likely to happen again. I would hope that her husband would have taken all of the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy. She is in for a rough ride. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to invalidate someone\u2019s mental illness just because you\u2019re ignorant.", "I didn't say anything about any of that. The person I replied to made a specific incorrect claim and I said why it was wrong, nothing about consequences or forgiveness", "There really is no justification for that, even being angry he could simply have said that OP needed to go to their parents or elsewhere, but the threats and blinding anger were over the top. Bother SiL and Brother both need to get into counseling for their mental health. \n\nNTA - SiL needs to be seeking help and if being pregnant unbalances her to the point of basically alienating everyone and lying perhaps she needs to find alternative ways of expanding their family (surrogates, adoption) \nMy ex-wife was bipolar (undiagnosed until I made her go to counseling) she would refuse to take her meds, (because she enjoyed the up end of her spectrum) and drop off the deep end quickly, even when I begged her to please take them. I know some of the meds can't be taken while pregnant so that presents a real problem.", "Even if I just took SIL\u2019s behavior, of course just saying sorry isn\u2019t going to cut it. Notice I talked about making amends. Part of that is doing things to not only make up for what happened but also ensure it doesn\u2019t happen in the future. Both of them seem to think a quick sorry and acting like it never happened is ok and even without the threat of the abuser that\u2019s bullshit.", "Some real acrobatics to imagine the brother is coercing her instead of the far more likely story: the claimed mental health issue triggered by pregnancy doesn't exist and is just an excuse.  Which is why she's pregnant again.", "NTA, but to be the devil's advocate here, you could possibly try to make some sort of amends here. I don't think holding firm on your hatred is going to be the healthiest option for you and your family in the long term, although I do admit you don't owe them anything. \n\nIt takes a lot more energy to be hateful or hard towards someone than it does to try and let them show you through their actions that they can change. While her actions were completely disgusting and wrong, I do believe everyone has the right to prove they can change. This doesn't mean you have to forgive her for what she did and you don't owe her that, but it could mean that you allow her the space she needs to show you that she's learning and is capable of being a better person. \n\nBe honest with her and your brother about how her actions affected you. Explain that while you're not ready to forgive them for what happened and you're not willing to sacrifice your peace to make them feel like everything is just fine again, you will take their actions into consideration if you can see that they're genuinely trying to do better. \n\nSome things I think that would be really important for sil to consider is therapy, possible medications, and maybe working to build up a group of friends who've dealt with her same struggles that could help her through these feelings she's having. If she's actively doing some of these things and is getting the help she needs, then maybe she could try to volunteer her assistance with your family more (parents, other family, maybe even yours if you become comfortable with it), anything. Do you have similar hobbies? That could also be a great way to maybe form some sort of connection. \n\nThere's likely a plethora of things that could work. Personally, I've always been one to try and remove the hate from my life as much as possible. I'd much rather have a kind-of-better relationship with certain family members than allow myself to feel that annoyance and hate each time I have to be around someone. \n\nObviously, you need to be very clear with boundaries and not let up on them until you decide you're ready to. If they can respect those, then I think things could turn around. If not, then you'll know it wasn't as genuine as they'd have you think, and you can go low or no-contact to best suit your comfort. \n\nI just see these things and say, \"man, I wish my family had willingly offered to apologize for all of the trauma and bullshit they put me through throughout all stages of my life.\" I've only ever gotten one if I've tried approaching first to admit my own faults. Only then would they say, \"yeah, we should've done better.\" It's never felt sincere for me, and it would be really nice if they'd even try like your Sil seems to be doing. \n\nOverall, you're not in the wrong and owe them nothing. At the end of the day, if you choose to continue your stance, then that's totally your right, and you aren't wrong for doing so. I do hope, however, that some sort of amicable truce can be made when you're ready to start that path. If you don't, she also has to learn to accept that and learn to be ok with it. That alone could be the truce you never expected. If she's working with a therapist, then I'm sure that will be a point of conversation they will end up having. \n\nBest of luck to you!", "HAHHAH NTA, You NEVER have to forgive an abuser. It doesn\u2019t matter what mental health problem they\u2019re going through. \n\nThe fact your brother didn\u2019t even want to consider your side and take hers 100% they\u2019re perfect for each other.
