If SIL is normally managing her disorder with medications, she may have had to stop after getting pregnant depending on the meds because some can cause birth defects. Also, hormones from pregnancy can cause wild mood swings in neurotypical women, so you can imagine how it might impact someone who already has a mood disorder. Also \u201cchose to get pregnant again\u201d maybe she feels pressure from her husband to have another child, maybe she feels having a family is worth sacrificing her mental health for 9 months, maybe she doesn\u2019t take hormonal birth control because it exacerbates her bipolar and she got pregnant on accident but couldn\u2019t bring herself to abort. Is it a decision I would make? nope.

It was triggered by forgetting to take my meds for a week after 2 difficult medical procedures and my dog almost dying. I'm just now starting to stabilize after about a month of being back on my meds. I've never accused anyone of anything but I have had an ex-friend who was also bipolar get straight up venomous with me for trying to help her, then she called several people and laughed about it right in front of me, later claiming it was due to mania. \n\nI can attest to it feeling like being trapped in your mind while your body is forcing you to roll with whatever impulsive shit is running through your head, but people can also just be assholes who happen to be bipolar.", "That did not even cross my mind..
