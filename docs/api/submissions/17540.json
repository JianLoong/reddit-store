However we bred them into having so many life altering health issues just so they could be more visually appealing to us. \n\nIt's really sad to see firsthand how it affects their quality of life. Considering how easy it is to research dog breeds nowadays I cannot believe your ex-wife could be ignorant in regards to potential health issues. \n\nBasically she should have known what she was getting into. Breeds like that can be quite expensive to purchase and quite expensive as far as upkeep is concerned too. Not even vet bills just high quality food because they tend to have allergies.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of breed it is, it doesn't even matter if you never brought up anything to your wife in regards to potential health issues. It's not your responsibility. \n\nIf I were in your position this issue would weigh heavily on my heart. Because I love animals more than most people. Also it's easy for your friends to say just give her the money when they're not in the position to have to fork it out themselves. \n\nI also feel like giving her the money for this medical issue now just sets you up for future problems because frequent and expensive veterinary visits can be par for the course with those breeds.\n\nNTA OP.\n\nAlso to all the people who are reading this and say I own a healthy English bulldog or Pekingese or Boston terrier or pug or French bulldog (the list goes on) and they've never seen the vet except for shots.\n\nThis only is my personal opinion based on my own experiences owning an English bulldog growing up  and working in the pet care industry for quite some time. \n\nEven when you have one of the healthiest versions of those breeds. There is still so many potential health issues it's crazy. Like if you think this post is long already be glad I didn't start going off on specific health issues \n\n\nIf you buy one of those breeds from a not great breeder you might as well buy a boat too because you seem to enjoy throwing your money at things that break in expensive ways.\n\nNTA OP, stand your ground. You are divorced so her problems are not yours to share anymore. Period.\n\nETA: If she's so concerned about the dog she can take out a loan for its care.  Also she should heavily consider getting pet insurance after this.", "NTA. All those friends could pitch in for the poor dog instead of hounding you. If she can't pay for the surgery, she can surrender the dog to a breed-specific rescue. They do all they can to help the dogs, and find them good homes after their surgeries.\n\nJust to mention, it's not so black-and-white with purebreds vs. mutts. Mutts have vider gene pools, but when bred willy-nilly it's basically up to luck if the dog will be healthy or not. Whereas responsible, registered breeders get all kinds of different medical tests done to their dogs before breeding, while also following the animal protection laws about what age the dog needs to be to get pregnant, how much you have to wait for the next litter and how many times the dog can be bred altogether.\n\nFor the mention, I personally don't think that breeders who breed sick breeds are responsible. They're more like animal abusers to me; they know that their dogs suffer, and they know that the puppies will suffer as well. Not a fan.\n\nI'm also not a fan of irresponsible backyard breeders or puppy millers. They don't care for the dog's health, don't care about genetics. Backyard breeders might not all be bad, but they are irresponsible. Puppy millers are just plain animal abusers.\n\nIf you want a mixed breed dog, go to a reputable shelter or a rescue. Make sure they actually take good care of the dogs, and that they truly want the dogs to go to a good home that fits their temperament and energy levels. There are bad rescues there as well, who will just give the dog to the first person who asks to get rid of the dog.\n\nAnd if you want a purebred, do a shit-ton of research to find a breed that is as healthy as they can be, that fits your lifestyle. Then another round of research to find a good breeder who has the animal's good health and temperament as priority.\n\nIdiots getting dogs without any research (or who simply don't care *because I want it*) are the reason there are so many homeless dogs.\n\nNow I do wish you would have put your foot down and not gotten her the puppy. She is the biggest asshole here, but you are also a bit at fault for buying the sick puppy in the first place. But it's her dog, you already contributed to it.

Also, you are saving a life at a shelter since there are too many puppies in the world. \n\nUnfortunately, purebred dogs now have so many health problems since people are too vain about a dog\u2019s appearance than the actual wellbeing/health of the dog, which both breaks my heart and makes me pissed off to the nth degree. \n\nI assume the (now) ex wanted a pug or some type bulldog?", "NTA. \n\nI feel awful for the dog, but your ex-wife can't have things both ways here - she's fine going no contact with you when things are good, but when things aren't so good and she needs money, suddenly she's back in touch trying to guilt you about your responsibilitie$? That's not how it works. \n\nShe can look into Care Credit to finance the surgeries - my husband and I used this years ago when we had some unexpectedly expensive vet bills.

Or have you confused ps, Post Script with Estimated Time of Arrival?", "Okay so I want to clarify this a little bit. \n\nThere completely are breeds that have such a small gene pool that they have some known genetic issues (looking at you, cavaliers). \n\nThere are also breeders that pump out \"pure bred\" dogs for profit; they are very good at hiding and appearing as though they are ethical breeders but you can spot them by asking for their k9data (if a retriever) or OFA clearances, etc. You get more genetically sick dogs from these breeders. \n\nSome mutts are very healthy. Some mutts are mixed with breeds that are generally fairly healthy. Some mutts are mixed with breeds that aren't. The main issue with a mutt is, unless you do genetic testing, you don't know what possible issues may arise that you could prevent with proper diet or care. \n\nWith a purebred dog from an ethical breeder, I know -everything- that could possibly go wrong with them. She carries the gene for dandruff, most likely not expressed. She's at a higher risk for uveitis, so I know to get yearly screenings done. I know when to spay her, I know what cancers are more likely, so I know what to watch for. Because I know what to watch for, I can do proper preventative care. \n\nWith a mutt, you do not have that info. Sure, they could be super healthy! Many are. Many pure bred dogs are too! I've had pure bred dogs that lived incredibly long, healthy lives and mutts that needed to be put down early because they got some awful form of incurable, untreatable cancer.", "It is worth noting that while mutts aren't prone to inbreeding, they often do inherit their parents' health issues, especially if their parents were purebred. It's one of the big problems \"designer\" mutts face: all the worst aspects of a lab or golden and a poodle mixed into one big pain in the ass. \n\nI love my rescue mutt, she costs me $80/month in meds alone, to say nothing of her special food & regular vetting (& her sweater budget because she's functionally bald & we live in NY). To say nothing of two torn ACL surgeries & two tooth extractions that had everything to do with the fact that she's an idiot and nothing to do with genetics. \n\nBut hey, she was free from an asshole's junkyard & she's cute, so I guess it's worth it.

The Frenchy at least in the U.S. is famous for the conformity more or less being a physically malformed breed.   \n\n\nThis is starting to become a probem across a lot of breeds, for example the German Shepherds starting to develop a confromity where the rear end of the dog is curved lower and lower.
