However we bred them into having so many life altering health issues just so they could be more visually appealing to us. \n\nIt's really sad to see firsthand how it affects their quality of life. Considering how easy it is to research dog breeds nowadays I cannot believe your ex-wife could be ignorant in regards to potential health issues. \n\nBasically she should have known what she was getting into. Breeds like that can be quite expensive to purchase and quite expensive as far as upkeep is concerned too. Not even vet bills just high quality food because they tend to have allergies.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of breed it is, it doesn't even matter if you never brought up anything to your wife in regards to potential health issues. It's not your responsibility. \n\nIf I were in your position this issue would weigh heavily on my heart. Because I love animals more than most people. Also it's easy for your friends to say just give her the money when they're not in the position to have to fork it out themselves. \n\nI also feel like giving her the money for this medical issue now just sets you up for future problems because frequent and expensive veterinary visits can be par for the course with those breeds.\n\nNTA OP.\n\nAlso to all the people who are reading this and say I own a healthy English bulldog or Pekingese or Boston terrier or pug or French bulldog (the list goes on) and they've never seen the vet except for shots.\n\nThis only is my personal opinion based on my own experiences owning an English bulldog growing up  and working in the pet care industry for quite some time. \n\nEven when you have one of the healthiest versions of those breeds. There is still so many potential health issues it's crazy. Like if you think this post is long already be glad I didn't start going off on specific health issues \n\n\nIf you buy one of those breeds from a not great breeder you might as well buy a boat too because you seem to enjoy throwing your money at things that break in expensive ways.\n\nNTA OP, stand your ground. You are divorced so her problems are not yours to share anymore. Period.\n\nETA: If she's so concerned about the dog she can take out a loan for its care.  Also she should heavily consider getting pet insurance after this.", "NTA. All those friends could pitch in for the poor dog instead of hounding you. If she can't pay for the surgery, she can surrender the dog to a breed-specific rescue. They do all they can to help the dogs, and find them good homes after their surgeries.\n\nJust to mention, it's not so black-and-white with purebreds vs. mutts. Mutts have vider gene pools, but when bred willy-nilly it's basically up to luck if the dog will be healthy or not. Whereas responsible, registered breeders get all kinds of different medical tests done to their dogs before breeding, while also following the animal protection laws about what age the dog needs to be to get pregnant, how much you have to wait for the next litter and how many times the dog can be bred altogether.\n\nFor the mention, I personally don't think that breeders who breed sick breeds are responsible. They're more like animal abusers to me; they know that their dogs suffer, and they know that the puppies will suffer as well. Not a fan.\n\nI'm also not a fan of irresponsible backyard breeders or puppy millers. They don't care for the dog's health, don't care about genetics. Backyard breeders might not all be bad, but they are irresponsible. Puppy millers are just plain animal abusers.\n\nIf you want a mixed breed dog, go to a reputable shelter or a rescue. Make sure they actually take good care of the dogs, and that they truly want the dogs to go to a good home that fits their temperament and energy levels. There are bad rescues there as well, who will just give the dog to the first person who asks to get rid of the dog.\n\nAnd if you want a purebred, do a shit-ton of research to find a breed that is as healthy as they can be, that fits your lifestyle. Then another round of research to find a good breeder who has the animal's good health and temperament as priority.\n\nIdiots getting dogs without any research (or who simply don't care *because I want it*) are the reason there are so many homeless dogs.\n\nNow I do wish you would have put your foot down and not gotten her the puppy.

Also, you are saving a life at a shelter since there are too many puppies in the world. \n\nUnfortunately, purebred dogs now have so many health problems since people are too vain about a dog\u2019s appearance than the actual wellbeing/health of the dog, which both breaks my heart and makes me pissed off to the nth degree. \n\nI assume the (now) ex wanted a pug or some type bulldog?", "NTA. \n\nI feel awful for the dog, but your ex-wife can't have things both ways here - she's fine going no contact with you when things are good, but when things aren't so good and she needs money, suddenly she's back in touch trying to guilt you about your responsibilitie$? That's not how it works. \n\nShe can look into Care Credit to finance the surgeries - my husband and I used this years ago when we had some unexpectedly expensive vet bills.

It becomes a genetic arms race of source, trying to exaggerate that single feature at the expense of overall health and soundness. \n\nIt\u2019s painfully obvious in the show Labs. They\u2019re big, blocky, heavy and are *not* really as athletic as they should be. Contrast and compare the breed Labs to the *working* Labs that are bred for talent, instinct and ability. Those dogs are leaner, slightly longer, have narrower heads and can run all day and half the night with just a short nap in there at some point. A friend of mine loves the look of show labs but mourns how they\u2019re not fast enough for Masters agility. Meanwhile, my working Lab was out there working at over 6 yards per second, hitting near Border Collie speeds as she raced around, always ready for more.", "Just like the German shepherd with its slanted back and hip problems. Back in the old times it was a normal shaped dog, a shepherd dog, then the slant appeared as a genetic problem and was introduced in the breed standard because it looked cool. I know someone who breeds GS with normal backs and cannot register them as GS. He doesn't care because the dogs won't end up with a painful and debilitating back and hips problem.", "There is a huge problem with English bulldogs too. They were bred to thenpiubt they cannot breathe and walk properly. Thankfully there seems to be a movement nt to make them healthier", "Sounds like their issue with back breeding French Bull dogs to bring them back to where they were a century ago. They are much healthier than modern French bulldogs, but the purebred community has backlashes it to a point where they have put rules in place that won\u2019t allow these dogs to compete as \u201cpurebred\u201d.", "I never understand these people who profess to \"love\" their breed who also refuse to outcross to weed out harmful genes or push back against garbage conformation rules.\n\n\nIt's like people get so caught up with conformation that they forget that, historically, conformation can and has changed, even today! For example, some Rottweilers are starting to get that upturned smooshy face you see in boxers and some Great Dane lines are turning into a droopy mess. To a degree I understand *why* breeders want to stick with conformation, but not to the point where it's harmful to the animals.\n\n\nThen you look into the world of working dogs where people are a lot less finicky. This is mainly bitework and herding dogs. There's attention to conformation, but the main draw is: can the dog do what it's bred to do? Can this other dog do the same job at least just as well? Great, maybe we should get puppies out of 'em. Obviously it's more complex than that, but I've already talked too much.\n\n\nSorry for the rant. Kind of a pet subject at times. \ud83d\ude05", "Yes, dalmatians in the UK are allowed to have black/patched ears, in the US that's a fault.  \n\nThe dalmatians in the US have horrible Urinary and deafness issues, in the UK it's better because they allow for more generic diversity", "There are definitely two very different types of German shepherd, too. Those that are bred for the qualities that make them good working dogs look completely different from show lines, especially with regards to their hips and the slope of their back.", "Some kennel clubs are working on this. \n\nLook at the differences between the British and US standards for German Shepherds. The breed had become so overbred in the sloping back that they could no longer be used as working dogs. In Britain, the standard changed to no longer allow that exaggerated slope in the back. The Crufts best in breed this year looked like a perfectly normal dog.\n\nHopefully the short nosed breeds will become the next targets.", "Those breeders trying to give pugs and such their snouts back are absolute legends imo. They clearly put the dogs wellbeing ahead of everything else and it's awesome.\n\nNo need to apologize, and your aunt sounds pretty amazing!", "As an indoor cats owner, you have no idea how much money goes to the vet every year. Having a pet insurance is a must.", "The retro pugs are so much cuter, too. Thanks for informing me they exist! I might actually want a pug now \ud83d\udc9b", "They are adorable!! Be sure to find a reputable breeder of course if you do look into them \ud83d\udc95", "it clearly shows they didn't learn anything from the DNA/genes section of biology 101 in high school. mixing two breeds of dogs is not the same as mixing chocolate and vanilla frozen yogurt. a great example of this is the \"doodle\" scheme", "little shit (affectionate)"]}
