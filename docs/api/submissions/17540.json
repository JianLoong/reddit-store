I wanna say Y TA because of the poor pup but in all honesty I gotta end up with a NTA. She made her decision to leave and cut off contact. Ex wife ex life not your problems.", "NTA and I LOVE dogs. Could you compromise by offering a very small amount towards the vet bills? So if it's $1600 for the bill, offet $200?", "NTA. \n\nNot your dog. It\u2019s as simple as. \n\nIf you care for the animal, and want to pay, then you can. But you\u2019re under no obligation to. \n\nThose friends that are saying you could/should pay, can also pay if they wish.", "Easily NTA.", "NTA, she obviously insisted on a brachyocephalic breed, which makes her the issue as she hasn't insured for its predictable health issues. \nAlso, if it has health issues now, it was purchased from a breeder who isn't breeding for health in the breed, which does make you also slightly at fault. As you are divorced, don't have shared ownership, then she is responsible for the vet bills. \n\nTell her that's what credit cards can be used for NTA.", "NTA. But I get the feeling that your friends are not getting the whole picture. Whilst I realise that some redditors think pets = children, that's really not how it works. I think you need to correct the narrative that's being spun and anyone who's still on her side, well ..., you know what to do.", "Save the pug!", "Her dog is not your problem. She is no longer your problem. Yeah for divorce.", "NTA if this was a thing, she would have contacted her lawyer. Cut off all contact! Even proxy contacts!", "NTA. I don't see how anyone who was truly your friend would think this debt is yours. If you absorbed some of her friendships it's probably easier to cut bait with false friends then be made to feel guilty about something that isn't remotely your concern.", "There's no obligation here.  Any assistance you might provide is for the dog ... not her.  If you decide to pay, pay directly to the veterinarian, not to her.  Is it possible to share the cost?  Your call, dude.", "NTA at all. Not your dog. Not your girlfriend/wife. Not your problem. Id let her know if she contacts any more friends and/or family, you will file for harrassment. Tell her and her shitty dog to fuck off.", "NTA. I would be so pissed if I were you. That's so crap that some people are taking her side. Some people get so dumb about this stuff. Not your wife anymore, not your dog either.", "NTA. \n\nAsk her for joint custody of the dog. She cant have it both ways", "NTA. It really does suck that her dog is sick, but it\u2019s truly not your responsibility. I get pets are like children because mine are, but people carry the fur baby thing too far\u2026you don\u2019t owe her \u201cdog support\u201d payments", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust block her number. And refuse to discuss it.", "NTA- you\u2019re divorced and the dog is in her full custody. You can help if you choose, but are not obligated in any way.", "NTA, tell her to start a GoFundMe, or tell her if you continue to pay the vet bills then it's your dog and you're going to keep it.", "NTA. \n\nUnless you have custody of the dog, it ain't your problem", "NTA.  It's her dog.", "NTA\nTell her to kick rocks.", "NTA: Not your circus, not your monkeys.. or dog. Let her get figure it out. It's called personal responsibility.

The only obligation you really have here is to the dog, and if you consider it better for the dog if your ex is forced to give it up, then you are acting responsibly. The thing is, you did buy the dog, so despite pressure you are responsible for it living with your ex.

If she wants them to pay, they should get to see the pup", "only I don't think OP wants the dog.", "Probably for the best.", "I dunno man.. some people get real fkn weird about dogs. Like if ex is saying dog's life is in the balance, dog people will be feeling some type of way.", "The point of the statement isn't to get the dog, it's to point out that if OP pays for the dog then it's OPs dog, so maybe the ex will stop asking. And if she's willing to surrender the dog to OP then she could do the same to the ASPCA or another organization that can pay the vet bills and re-home the dog with a family that can actually afford it.", "Sure, and I'm that way about my cat. But if the ex was that worried about the dog, she should have thought of that before the divorce was final.", "Yeah I definitely agree. I am just aware not everyone would."]}
