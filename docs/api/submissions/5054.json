Did a really difficult chemo regime, had surgery, and got the best news possible last month- it\u2019s called no evidence detected (NED) - it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m cancer free, Cancer cells could be dormant or hiding somewhere else. So I\u2019m currently in radiation and have another treatment for a year.\n\nI lost my hair from chemo but it\u2019s growing back - frankly, it looks like a cool, cute buzz cut so I didn\u2019t wear a wig or scarf when I went out with my friend M (32f). Another woman complemented my hair, mentioned she wanted to shave her head but wasn\u2019t brave enough (yet). I lightheartedly replied \u201cI\u2019m not brave, I just have cancer\u201d and encouraged her to do it. Honestly, super pleasant exchange, not awkward (I promise).\n\nLater, M told me I was an AH for saying I HAVE cancer when technically I got an NED. My thing is I\u2019m still in active treatment (radiation), and\u2026 I mean\u2026 I don\u2019t have any fingernails or feeling in my toes (I lost both from chemo), as cute as my hair is losing it was traumatic, and I basically spent the last year in hell. Also, I still could have cancer, again I\u2019m not \u201ccancer free.\u201d All my family, friends, and work colleagues know ab my NED - not trying to mislead people - but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve been an AH to other cancer patients who didn\u2019t get that result / there is definitely evidence of cancer. FWIW in my mind I planned on saying I HAD cancer once I\u2019m don\u2019t w/ radiation and in retrospect I should have just said thanks, but it comes up in other contexts too.\n\nEdit: I should have explained that M\u2019s mom died of cancer last year. I\u2019ve been very sensitive to this  and routinely check in to see if seeing me or hearing ab stuff is too much for her.  That background to M\u2019s reaction is also what made me think saying that I have cancer is misleading / disrespectful to those who have had it far worse or died", "created_utc": 1671380839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp2bx6/aita_for_telling_people_i_have_cancer_when/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not feel guilty for speaking about your experiences in the way that you feel comfortable with.", "NTA. It\u2019s still not officially over for you. Hopefully, you won\u2019t have to continue cancer treatment after your radiation. The distinction your friend is making is pointless.", "NTA. You didn't say it for pity or attention. You did it as short hand to explain why you look the way you do. Total strangers have no right (and likely no interest) in the full details.

And congrats on your successful treatment.\n\nWhy is your boyfriend making  an issue of this?  If I were to guess, I would say that he's most likely scared of someone he loves having cancer and by making this distinction, he feels more secure that you will be around for some time to come.

The fact that you lost your hair to chemo was relevant to the conversation. A stranger doesn't need to hear the details of your treatment. You could maybe just say it's going very well. You're still being treated for cancer. Radiation treatment isn't easy! Even after your treatment ends, you'll be recovering from it for a long time. Honestly, I'd re-evaluate your friendship with M.

I know.  I'm fighting tnbc for the second time.\n\nYou need positive people around you who will continue encouraging you even when it is done.

You're good.", "Mine's put of maintenance already, but I was thinking the same thing.\nMy kid was MRD negative 2 months in to 24 months of chemo. MRD is where they literally check a million bone marrow cells looking for cancer and she had 0 cancer cells. There was absolutely no cancer cells to be found in her body, but without continuing the following 22 months of chemo, she would be dead rather than sleeping in the next room. MRD negative or NED and in treatment is not the same as not having cancer.", "NTA - you\u2019re still in treatment and I\u2019m sure it was a long road and a hell of a fight to get this far.
