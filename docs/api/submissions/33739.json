{"id": 33739, "submission_id": "18r2c52", "title": "AITA For doing too much for the holidays?", "selftext": "Every holiday usually ends in a fight. I (44F) and my husband (45M) have three kids (20F, 18F & 11M). We don't live in the US. My eldest kids don't live at home. We don't celebrate Thanksgiving together because it isn't a holiday where we live, so I try to do Thanksgiving for Christmas, in terms of the menu. The responsibility of cooking, cleaning and shopping essentially is mine. There are a few things that my family will do. My eldest makes gingerbread cookies with her other siblings. They usually just decorate. It is pulling teeth to get them to clean up the mess afterwards. My husband makes the eggnog, which he started as a small tradition, although he just said it was my idea (It was not.) and he also makes the mashed potatoes. My kids say Dad makes the best potatoes, so I make him make them since his potatoes are the best according to the kids and it is one less thing I have to make, if I can get him to make them... He usually insists that I peel and boil them. My son does the least, but he will run to the corner store if I need something, extra eggs, butter. It is a 2 minute ride on his electric scooter to the store and he usually will do it if I give him extra money for a treat. I asked him to crack me a cup of walnuts for the apple pie. He cracked about a 1/4 cup and gave up because there were too many rotten ones.  \nWe celebrate two cultures, so Christmas Eve dinner is for my husband's family and his mother does the cooking, but my kids don't like it because it is essentially vegan, so I make lunch of stuff they like. This year it was pulled pork and a burrito bar. My eldest made the rice. But because we don't live in the US, some of our favorite foods are not able to be purchased in a grocery store, so I have to make everything from scratch. Everyone has their favorites... I try to accommodate everyone's needs. My youngest daughter also had a friend joining us, so I wanted to make good food for him too.  \nTo be clear our menu isn't that complicated, but if I say I want to skip something, for example this year I wanted to skip making spinach dip, which is my husband's favorite. He complained and said he would make the eggnog, if I didn't make the spinach dip. In the end, I made it, but he never made the eggnog, at all... When I woke up on the morning of the 26th, no one put any of the food away\u2026 The turkey was still on the counter. The dishes were everywhere. No one ran the dishwasher... which is why I am writing this. I am angry that I am trying to give everyone the holiday they want. Making the holiday magic of their childhoods and my Christmas, my holiday is a week of cooking, cleaning, prepping and shopping.  \nMy eldest daughter said next year that her boyfriend might not join us for Christmas because he hates seeing her treated like a slave. I don\u2019t see chores and shared responsibility as slavery. I really am starting to hate the holidays.", "created_utc": 1703574127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r2c52/aita_for_doing_too_much_for_the_holidays/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
