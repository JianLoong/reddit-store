Ok, sure. I was looking forward to a relaxing weekend, but family is family, and my cousin is asking to visit.\nWe went to the grocery and a few other shops when they were here, and I asked if there was anything they wanted. My cousin grabbed a bag of chips at the grocery, and said that was all they wanted, they had bought their own food. (They took these chips home with them without opening them.)\nWhen I was loading the car to take my cousin home I noticed some food from my pantry in their bag.\nWhen my cousin went upstairs to grab their stuff, I unpacked the things from my pantry and put them back. I didn't say anything to my cousin because I really didn't know how to approach it. \nThis is my cousin's kid, and I see them a few times a year. I didn't mind hosting an overnight stay, and I didn't mind buying snacks they would want while they visited. What bothered me was the entitlement of taking food from my pantry without asking or being offered. To me that is more of an immediate family thing (parent/sibling/child) not an extended family perk. I am more than happy to share while you are visiting, but taking food to go without being offered first offended me. Am I being selfish? My cousin's parents ensure that my cousin has everything they need, so food insecurity is not an issue.\nEdit- the food items were snacks... chips and such. They are from a local business.

He stole from you.", "Just throwing this out there....\n\n1) Are you absolutely sure those were your food and not the food they said they brought with them? It could be similar. \n\n2) Do you have a partner/spouse that could have packed those pantry foods without them knowing?  I do that with our guests, I pack stuff for them to take with them.", "NTA. My aunt and uncle in AZ have an open pantry/drink policy if it\u2019s available and you ask them, they will offer you a grocery bag to take it! She sent me home from thanksgiving with a large $20 container of macadamia nuts and a huge Costco bag of beef jerky, a few drinks and said her pantry is always mine. I was literally so grateful I was in tears. As a student I can\u2019t afford my fav snacks. Your cousin should\u2019ve asked not stolen", "INFO\n\nWhat were the food items, and how do you know they're from your pantry?", "NTA\n\nShe was wrong. It is the principle of the issue and you should probably call her out on it if it happens again.\n\nThat or ban them. They should have asked first. You had a right to take your food back.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who goes shopping in my parents house on a regular basis. I ask first before I take stuff out of the house.", "NTA.

This may be OK with other family members, but I am a self built/sufficient person, and perfer to choose where my charity/money goes.", "I am very friendly with their parent, who is my direct cousin, and they will be visiting soon. Will have a conversation with them about what happened, and won't have this specific person back for a bit.", "If it was real food type items, I might wonder, but this is chips and snacky things. I know they get a stipend from the Uni, money from their parents, and have 3 roommates that would step in if food insecurity was really an issue", "We went to a boutique shop that sold said snacks. While there I asked if cousin wanted anything and they said No. So I am sure that cousin did not bring these snacks. I live by myself and am certain of what food I have in my pantry/cupboard.", "They food they took was chips and snacks. The only food they brought was in a casserole dish.", "My husband comes from wealthy educated parents and no one would believe how much housing insecurity he\u2019s faced.", "Was this an amount of food it was unreasonable for the two of you to eat over the drive?", "How could that possibly be relevant? They still took it without permission", "I'm wondering if they grabbed a snack for the car and it was a simple misunderstanding.", "Yeah, I could see grabbing a snack or two for the car for them to share. That would be different. But OP would know that because on the trip they would have been like what happened to my snacks?", "But it's still theft if you don't ask?

You took cousin shopping, asking if they wanted anything, gave no reason to think (as far as one can tell from your post) that if they had asked you or expressed an interest or need you would have said no.  Cousin can use their words and ask for something if they want it.  Taking it and stuffing it in their bag is a strange move.  Is there any chance cousin has klepto issues?  Or an eating disorder that makes them hide food they want?  Anyway its funny to think of cousin unpacking that bag and finding the things gone.  Wonder if you'll ever hear anything about that.", "This is really weird! I\u2019ve grabbed a pack of gummies or a can of pop to take with me for a car ride from families house, but I\u2019ve never heard of cleaning out the pantry when I go. That\u2019s definitely a new one! NTA", "It's not normal behavior though, unless a cousin was raised with another family and was used to acting that way.  If I go to my sister, I might eat something from the cabinets while I'm there, but she will always have said \"take whatever you want\" first and I'd never grab something to take home unless I had a really long trip on my own and needed it for emergency snacking or if she'd bought it specifically for me.   I doubt your cousins family would think it's normal.  I don't know if you should ask the cousin about it or their parents.  It might be the sign of something deeper - I mentioned kleptomania and eating disorders in another reply to your original post.  But not sure it's worth violating cousin's privacy and asking a parent."]}
