She showed it to me yesterday and thought it was super cool, however my mom is super SUPER against tattoos, like she\u2019s told me she would kick me out of the house for a tattoo. I\u2019m not trying to be a tattle tail but I\u2019m genuinely worried about how much trouble she could get in. My generation is not the same as hers and my mom lets her have a lot more freedom than I did as a kid so I didn\u2019t get into the kinds of things she does, but she\u2019s also told me about how she\u2019s been hanging out with her friend (13f) and apparently they got in a car with other teen boys (16m) (15m) and were running around the woods, for context this is the same day she also got the tattoo so she just went wild on that day I guess. I\u2019m honestly terrified if my mom does not wrangle her in now, it will get way worse. I love my little sister too death and I\u2019m so conflicted because she confided this in me but I\u2019m wanting to do some type of prevention because I know it will only get worse if she is only 13 and already getting into this stuff. I could care less about the tattoo itself, my concern is her getting some kind of disease from it or getting into worse trouble way outside of this tattoo. I think it\u2019s a small thing, but an indication for more trouble to come. I did try to talk to her about it and let her understand the risks but she had absolute ZERO care and thought it was funny.

One of them may have a blood borne disease.  The risk may not be 'that' high but it's there none the less.  So at minimum your sister needs a set of blood test now and then again in 3 months time.\n\nShe's going to regret that tattoo as she gets older as it will be visible.\n\nIronically a friend of mine - her daughter did exactly the same thing with her friends at about the same age... yes she did get blood tests because as soon as the risk of blood borne diseases was brought up... the penny dropped for her and it was a real, 'Oh shit!' moment for her.\n\nNow that she's a couple or so years older... she really regrets what she did.  It's visible and she really hates it.  Now she's going to have to pay to get laser done to remove as much of it as possible.. hopefully all of it.  That's going to be painful and expensive.", "nta\n\ni would normally say not to\n\nbut this is dangerous\n\nshe is putting herself at risk of catching blood born pathogens cross condemnations\n\ni am a tattoo artist please get her checked, she needs full blood work up if needles were shared, a round of antibiotic's for infections \n\nalso is putting herself at risk of peer pressure", "This sounds dangerous either way. If you keep secret, the tattoo could get infected, or your mom may notice it eventually on her own when you might not be there to mitigate.\n\nIf you do tell, you may have to protect your sister from your mom's rage. If she gets abusive or throws your sister out, please call CPS. Even better if you could talk to your sister first and come up with a strategy for what to do if that happens. Good luck.", "NTA for being concerned. \n\nAnd, unfortunately, you do need to say something because I don\u2019t know how it is where you live, but here you have to be 18 to get a tattoo without parental consent. So, the real concern here is that some adult signed off as your sisters legal guardian for her to get that tattoo. Unless it\u2019s a junk tattoo by someone not in a studio? You weren\u2019t clear. \n\nBut that adult needs to be straightened out, and that can\u2019t happen until your sister is called to task for the tattoo.", "NTA. You should tell your mom about the tattoo. It's not about being a tattle tale, it's about protecting your sister. If she's already hanging out with older boys and getting tattoos, who knows what else she'll get into. Your mom needs to know and set boundaries.", "YWNBTA.\n\nAs a lot of dumb teens do, I pierced my own ear and it got horribly infected. Stick and pokes can be even worse with the potential for needle sharing and other unhygienic activities. \n\nYour sister is 13, she needs to have these discussions with your mum for **safety** reasons that she's not thinking about. But I think you need to have a really clear conversation with your mum that she needs to be careful in her approach because you need to remain a trusted adult to your sister. \n\nThe other option is say nothing to your mum but read your sister the riot act yourself. It's on her finger, your mum will likely spot it pretty quick.", "NTA - tell your mom before your sister contracts HIV", "NTA and my biggest concern wouldn\u2019t be the tattoo itself but what else is a 13 yo getting into that isn\u2019t allowed, and who she\u2019s hanging out with.", "It's on her finger, mom is going to notice it sooner or later. It's inevitable. Honestly, I would be more concerned about riding around with older teenage boys and getting into who knows what else. I would tell mom that if she does not reign in little sis then she better start getting ready to be a grandma in a couple years", "It\u2019s on her finger \ud83d\ude12 exactly how unobservant is your mother? It\u2019s not exactly an easy place to hide and frankly your sister deserves any consequences coming her way for being so stupid and provocative towards your mother \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGets told not to tattoo herself or there will be dire consequences so she tattoos her hand at 13? HAAAA \n\nFAFO.", "[deleted]", "YWBTA. A lot of people here naming  it\u2019s unsafe for her to get a tattoo as the reason you\u2019re NTA, but you can take her to a doctor or minute clinic to get it checked out and treated if she\u2019s sick. You wouldn\u2019t have to involve your mom. \n\nYou\u2019re already telling us that there could be monumental consequences for what\u2019s essentially a teenager doing something stupid, which all teens do. So why risk creating such a massive problem between your sister and mom.\n\nObviously she deeply values your opinions. You can talk with her and explain why her behavior is dangerous and how it can impact her future. You have a unique perspective of being an adult who lived through what she\u2019s going through not long ago. \n\nBut the biggest issue here is trust. Telling on her to your mom will make her never trust you again. The underlying problems won\u2019t get solved, and now she won\u2019t come to you when she does other, possibly worse things. She needs you as a sister and mentor now, not a police officer. \n\nTake her to the doctor to get checked for infection, give her a good talking to explaining what she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t funny or cool - it\u2019s reckless - and ensure her that you\u2019ll keep this between you two so long as she changes her behavior. (So long as no one else is getting hurt or anything seriously illegal is happening)", "YTA if you tell her about the tattoo. That would be the wrong way to go about it imo. You\u2019re an adult, talk to you sister. You\u2019ll probably have a better ability to influence her than your mom, as she told you. You can give your mom some info, but betraying your sister by telling on her could make you someone she\u2019ll never trust again.", "YTA\n\n\nWhy can't you talk with her? I feel like you ratting her out, will just make her double down and not telling you things anymore", "Yta", "Yta leave your sister alone everyone gets tattoos nowadays it is really no big deal at all", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't know where the needle she tattooed herself with has been, and I'll bet neither do she or her friends. Get her into a doctor now before she starts showing symptoms of illness.", "NTA. You need to take her to an urgent care or ER as soon as humanly possible. All it takes is one unvaccinated friend who has latent hepatitis and doesn't know it to make your sister very sick. \n\nAlso, the doctor may or may not recommend this based on her risk factors, but you should ask if PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV is still an option. Lots of people don't know that after an exposure or likely exposure, you can ask for a 28-day course of medicine that can prevent the virus from taking hold in your body. You have to start it within three days and every hour counts, so the sooner you get your sister medical attention, the better.", "A tattoo a 13 yo and running in the woods with 16 yo?

Informing your mother could do potentially irreparable damage to your relationship. The best way to go about this is to express your concern with safety (separate from your mothers dislike) perhaps say you\u2019d be interested in a tattoo also and look up safety tips and stuff like that together (only with people you trust in a safe and clean environment with a design you\u2019ve wanted for a while when you\u2019re over 18). Obviously kids do dumb stuff and she will too, you have, your mum has, but quietly expressing your concerns for safety while not breaching her trust is best. You knowing about these things is safer for her than not.", "Nta. Here's the thing- your mom is going to find out. She's either going to see it herself (like is your sister going to wear gloves permanently) or a teacher or parent will make a reference to the tattoo right in front of her. Tell your sister hey this is going to come out anyways, let's tell mom together and I'll try to support/ mediate the discussion. Its just not worth keeping the secret. Your sister wants to pretend she's an adult, she can be an adult and take her lumps now. Point out opening Christmas presents, painting her nails, doing dishes etc are all things that will draw her mom's eyes to her hands. This won't stay a secret. Deal with the drama now not later.", "NTA\nShe got a stick n poke from another 13yo? Yeah, you are 100% right to be worried. Get her blood checked.

She went and did something unbelievably stupid and potentially dangerous (homemade tattoos often lead to serious infections, especially when they\u2019re done by CHILDREN).\n\nOP\u2019s parents need to be told about this immediately. Her little sister has done something stupid and unsafe, her parents need to be told about it.\n\nBesides, they\u2019ll find out about the tattoo eventually.

Us parents are pretty sneaky when we need to be.", "OP, you need to tell your parents about this immediately.\n\nNot only because they have a right to know what their minor child has done, but also because of the potentially life-threatening health issues that could result from this.\n\nShe needs to see a doctor ASAP, to ensure that she doesn\u2019t develop an infection and hasn\u2019t contracted any diseases via the sharing of needles. She won\u2019t be laughing if she winds up with hepatitis or HIV from this dumb decision.\n\nI highly doubt she and her friends used ink designed for tattooing. They likely used pen ink, which can be toxic (depending on the type of ink used).\n\nDon\u2019t keep this from your parents. Your sister will be mad at first, but that\u2019s a lot better than her potentially losing a finger or even her life."]}
