This is cliche but kids are going to be kids and do what they think is \u201ccool,\u201d and I always want my sister to give me a call when she needs me, and to know I won\u2019t judge her or rat on her. I have her location and there have been several instances where she was lying to my dad about her whereabouts, and he demanded I tell him, and I always say no. No one was GPS tracking me at that age and I want her to know I have her back. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t get concerned; I\u2019ll text her just asking if she\u2019s safe and she says yes, love you too, and I feel better. If I were to tell my dad where she was, it would cause a huge rift between us and she wouldn\u2019t want to actually be close to me. She\u2019s gonna do all that shit no matter what, the difference is whether I\u2019m a phone call away if something really bad happens. I know it\u2019s scary and you feel responsible.

Are you prepared to give your sister a home if your mom kicks her out, or becomes abusive? Your concerns are valid, but I worry about the consequences of your approach. Doubling down on strict parenting typically pushes kids into more wild behavior, and if you tell on your sister now then she will see it as a betrayal and will not trust you anymore. She likely won't confide in you the next time she runs wild.\n\nRight now, she trusts you. If she gets into trouble or gets hurt, you're a safe person she can call or go to.

There's no unringing that bell. \n\nFor now, I'd advise trying to continue to talk to your sister, tell her you're coming from a place of concern, you don't want her getting sick or hurt. Ask about what aftercare she's doing for the tattoo, make sure it gets cleaned and let her know you'll take her to the doctor if it starts to hurt. Chances are, since it's on as visible a place as her finger, your mom will find out anyway without you having to tell her, and then you can keep your sister's trust. \n\nTry to find out what the root of this behavior is.

Some people are saying that your mom might kick her out but the way you worded things makes it sound like that would have been a consequence for you, but not your sister; it sounds like mom is a lot less strict with her, so I imagine she wouldn't get thrown out. But some others brought up the point that she won't trust you anymore, and they're probably right. If you go to mom but don't get through to her now and she's in worse trouble somewhere down the line, chances are she's way less likely to come to you for help and will instead suffer for it.
