This is cliche but kids are going to be kids and do what they think is \u201ccool,\u201d and I always want my sister to give me a call when she needs me, and to know I won\u2019t judge her or rat on her.

No one was GPS tracking me at that age and I want her to know I have her back. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t get concerned; I\u2019ll text her just asking if she\u2019s safe and she says yes, love you too, and I feel better. If I were to tell my dad where she was, it would cause a huge rift between us and she wouldn\u2019t want to actually be close to me. She\u2019s gonna do all that shit no matter what, the difference is whether I\u2019m a phone call away if something really bad happens. I know it\u2019s scary and you feel responsible.

Are you prepared to give your sister a home if your mom kicks her out, or becomes abusive? Your concerns are valid, but I worry about the consequences of your approach. Doubling down on strict parenting typically pushes kids into more wild behavior, and if you tell on your sister now then she will see it as a betrayal and will not trust you anymore. She likely won't confide in you the next time she runs wild.\n\nRight now, she trusts you. If she gets into trouble or gets hurt, you're a safe person she can call or go to.

There's no unringing that bell. \n\nFor now, I'd advise trying to continue to talk to your sister, tell her you're coming from a place of concern, you don't want her getting sick or hurt. Ask about what aftercare she's doing for the tattoo, make sure it gets cleaned and let her know you'll take her to the doctor if it starts to hurt. Chances are, since it's on as visible a place as her finger, your mom will find out anyway without you having to tell her, and then you can keep your sister's trust. \n\nTry to find out what the root of this behavior is.

Some people are saying that your mom might kick her out but the way you worded things makes it sound like that would have been a consequence for you, but not your sister; it sounds like mom is a lot less strict with her, so I imagine she wouldn't get thrown out.

If you go to mom but don't get through to her now and she's in worse trouble somewhere down the line, chances are she's way less likely to come to you for help and will instead suffer for it.

The only reason the sister knows about the tattoo and the boys and everything else is because her sister told her. Not because she uncovered it herself. \n\nSo if the sister no longer trusts OP, she\u2019ll have no idea what\u2019s going on in her sisters life. To me, especially since she clearly hangs around a not-so-great crowd, having that trust is essential in the event she ends up getting involved in something worse. That will be the time to go to your parent.", "Could you let her school know anonymously?", "What????", "In the US there are many regulations such as signed forms from the legal guardian or custodial parent. Everyone must give a form of ID and sign multiple documents that state that there is permission to have it done. The guardian/ custodial parent also has to be present and most shops will not tattoo anyone under the age of 16. I know that your argument is that they shouldn\u2019t but I know this because I got matching ones with my mom at a proper tattoo shop when I was 17 and maybe this will give some insight. Have a wonderful day.", "It wouldn't surprise me either way, I've seen loads of videos on tiktok of tattoo artists talking about teenagers buying tattoo kits easily on amazon and warning them against it\n\nBut it also wouldn't surprise me if they are just using shitty pen ink", "I think of it less as every guy is bad and more that you don\u2019t know who is unless you know them real well or they do something, in which case it\u2019s too late.", "Well I feel like long term, the hobby of trying to manage other people\u2019s lives won\u2019t work out so well. And since OP is asking for feedback, that\u2019s what I have to say about it.", "Long term, they shouldn\u2019t try and manage other people\u2019s lives. If the 13 year old doesn\u2019t understand shared needles - she\u2019ll win a Darwin Award for something else soon enough. Op should find something more sustainable to do.", "I have hated my brother ever since he ratted me out to my dad immediately when he got home from work. He was making a lot of noise, so I knocked on the wall. He knocked back. I kicked the wall. Put a hole in the drywall, tried hiding it with a pillow. My dad was abusive so I knew he'd yell at me when he came in... needed to work him up to knowing about it. Comes home from work to his kids, immediately my brother rats, I get yelled at. \n\nHated him ever since.", "I would do 12 because 12 apostles one for each of them", "I'm amazed that they did the tattoo. It's illegal at that age without parental consent, and some parlours won't do it even with consent at that age because of the liability risks", "None of that means they were ethical.\n\nYou don't perform any kind of body alterations on a minor without clear consent from their adult.", "There's no tattoo shop that isn't shady that lets a 14yo get a tattoo, sorry. 16 with parental consent is still probably sketchy but I can be persuaded on a case by case basis but 14 absolutely not", "Nah I think there\u2019s a difference between having an adult there that gives consent, and a 14 year old just rocking up on their own and being able to be tattooed. Anywhere not going down the proper avenues, isn\u2019t reputable because they\u2019re cutting corners clearly.", "I think you may be dealing with a warped perception dude to the emotions and excitement surrounding the experience of the memory. It happens man, especially when you\u2019re remembering things from a long time ago, the details aren\u2019t as easy to remember as the emotions are. \n\nThat being said, as someone with tattoos, and who has a lot of acquaintances with tattoos, there is absolutely no tattoo shop that tattoos on minors without consent that isn\u2019t a bit trashy in some way. Just the fact of the matter alone, tattooing minors without their parents consent, makes it a trashy studio.", "This is the only part I'd say YTA regarding.\n\nOP can help her sister out in ways that would mitigate her sister's risk, though, without telling their mom, I'd think. But that'll require finding and utilizing outside resources. I have no idea what might be available where they are.", "Good point\u2026 definitely better to be safer than sorry\u2026 also *SALT N BURN* \ud83e\uddc2\ud83d\udd25", "Well\u2026 I mean\u2026 there was this guy who thought 7 was a good number to rest after \ud83e\udd14\u2026", "18 is the minimum age in the UK.", "My state a parent can\u2019t even consent to a minor getting one. Some dumbass allowed their child to, had regrets so sued the tattoo artist so my state just so no more!", "I know tattoo shops today that would tattoo any age of paid enough. They show you how to take care of it and it\u2019s y\u2019all little secret. They won\u2019t do it with every random tho. It\u2019s like an invite only club. Found that out earlier last month", "Sure, but that is different concern then cleaning and hygiene one.\n\nWorld is nit neatly separated between bad and good shops where good ones do everything right and bad ones do everything bad.\n\nFairly often, you get combinations - like reputable hygienic shop that does not care about age. Especially in places where tattoos are normalized and there is no risk of government sanctioning them.", "We let our kid get a tattoo at 16 because they graduated high school early and the school wouldn\u2019t let them walk. We wanted to give them SOME kind of reward. We took them to the shop we usually went to and had no problems. They sat like a champ.", "No no. I completely understand. I just thought that the info of how a real tattoo shop(in the US)would do things might be able to give some insight. Not discrediting anything. Just wanted to give some info.", "I think she can be the 21 year old adult she claims she is and **help** her sister through a hard time, without destroying all trust with her sister, ruining their relationship, and possibly making her homeless.", "Yet the younger sister does not care when OP tried to mentor her as stated on the last sentence of the post. If she doesn't care about the risks then what? You can't teach a wall.", "A 13 year old should trust her 21 yr old sibling to watch out for her. Sometimes that means letting the parent know what is going on. This is not a 13 and 15 year old. This is a child and an adult, and being safe is the most important thing right now. A \"mentor\" would have a responsibility to tell the parent if their underaged child was behaving dangerously.", "The finger?", "We're talking old Lord Voldy, right? Lol", "Naw, he *rested* on the 7th....so do 6, take a nap, drink a beer, have a little snackie snack (but NOT an apple), then do 6 more.  Then you're done, cuz we wouldn't want to accidentally tack a 3rd 6 on there....", "My mom was the same way. She always looked *years* older than what she was so she was able to essentially do whatever she wanted. She was able to go into liquor stores and purchase and not get carded as a teenager. Yet, here I am, over 21 and sometimes get carded to get into an R rated movie.", "Good!", "Wait. what? We\u2019re not all murcans? Checks passport. You\u2019re RIGHT! I\u2019m not a yank. Whew. Safe.", "I did a stick and poke tattoo of the cool S on my chest when I was 38 but I used a mirror so it's a backwards cool S but I like it when I see it in the mirror still. I wish it didn't cover my entire chest though.", "I mean there's two ways there could go 1st, the mom kicks her out and OP takes her in, 2nd it was just a mom saying shitty things and both OP and her help the girl. Either way there she ain't gonna be homeless bc, if OP cares about her sister it she knows one of the two will happen and she won't be homeless. And if OP lives with their mom and the mom tries to kick her out then i'd imagine OP goes with her sister.\n\nAlso now that I think about it, if OP and her sister exist then there's a dad in the mix which if he's in their life then the sis definitely ain't homeless.", "And you can\u2019t punish one either then lol. Kids are odd. They don\u2019t always react the way adults do or might expect. She might have laughed in the moment as a knee jerk reaction, but I guarantee OP got through to her a bit. \n\nShe never would have showed OP in the first place if she didn\u2019t care about her opinion.", "*EVERYTHING*", "\ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd10", "Spoilers!", "Tattoo studios were a lot shadier then than they are now as well. \n\nBack in the day when meemaw called it a \"tattoo parlour\"", "Yes,I was the same \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 but luckily I pretty much seemed to stop ageing ( for now ) when I turned 25-ish.

I do however have a very rigorous and expensive skin care routine I didn't have in my teens \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019ve been on r/stickandpoke so long I genuinely believe this while my whole heart", "this isn't really a situation where we can be definite that little sister wouldn't be homeless. it's a risk and because it's a risk it's worth taking into consideration when trying to figure out how to go about the situation. being optimistic is good, but being realistic about the negative possibilities is important too", "i mean, she very well could end up homeless (or both of them), since the 21 year old is most likely just beginning a job career and not earning enough to support her and her sister.\n\nthe housing market (depending on where they live) could be terrible, and make it impossible to get a place to stay.\n\nand lastly the 21 year old might not simply want to parent.\n\nthe only way I see this resolved is if she was able to get her sister checked out at the doctor's, without the mother knowing\n\n\nEDIT: forgot to add that the father could be dead, a deadbeat, worse than the mom, sick (physically or mentally)", "If OP really got to her, she wouldn't be making this post, so you can't really say that just to affirm your point since you don't have future sight along with knowing the sister.. \n\nEither the sister showed her just to show off (which is typical teen behavior) or wanted to get her opinion. The fact that she doesn't care about the risks more points to the former. \n\nI'm not saying to punish whomever, but eventually push comes to shove due to narcissistic stupidity (since teenagers in this grown stage are proven to be developmentally wired to be more focused about themselves, in which we have all been there to some degree) to where now the consequences are REALLY dire. What then? Where is it that you draw line and what makes someone a \"good sibling\" as you say, both objectively and subjectively?", "Lol right. Glad I grew up in the late 90s ti early 2000s. I'm 40 and I know I'm an 80s baby but definitely a 98/01 teen", "I hope I get that luck! Good skincare goes a long way!", "I\u2019ve had the police find a fake ID in two separate occasions a few years ago and they just took them and didn\u2019t get charged with anything. One of the times I also had alcohol and they just took it still sealed no problems I\u2019m guessing they took it home for themselves haha", "They said they aren\u2019t English - not that they\u2019re not from the UK so it\u2019s right to assume they are, in fact, from UK.
