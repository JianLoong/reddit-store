Your cat is your family member.", "NTA\n\nPets aren't disposable items they are members of the family.\n\nMy cat followed me home when I was 16 ; and when I was 28 he had to have an eye taken out for medical reasons. My boyfriend at the time had already protested Skitty sleeping on the bed at all (he doesn't even like being under the blankets) but when he was recovering from his surgery Pete was upset that I had him sleeping up with me as my little injured spoon. Pete went off his nut, yelling thay he wasn't going to sleep in the same bed as an animal that could possibly bleed, pee or poo during the night...\n\nI asked him then where he would like to sleep then .?\n\nBecause that's how it works. The cat was there first. Eff your boyfriend off. You're definitely not the asshole for continuing to choose your pet over any other person on earth who doesn't understand .\n\nP.S. Check my post history for pics of the cutest pirate cat ever !", "Personally I don\u2019t think any relationship stands a chance when one person gives an ultimatum to another to give up a loving member of their family. But perhaps rephrasing it may help: Does my boyfriend\u2019s semi-nonexistent asthma outweigh my anxiety, depression, and ptsd? NTA", "NTA\n\nLove me, love my cat.", "NTA. You don't need to justify your desire to keep your pet. It's valid. It seems like you're very happy with your cat and your life is better for it. I have a cat too, and she's gotten me through a lot (recently, the sudden death of my husband). I would live with her in my car before I'd let her go. All to say, please contrast that level of understanding & unconditional love to the behavior from your BF. Is it he or your cat who has your best interest at heart? I don't want to sound harsh, but it seems like a red flag - especially because kitty is an emotional supporter. I would hate for you to feel isolated without your cat and have it negatively impact your health. It seems controlling, and I'd definitely think twice (or more) before moving in. Best of luck to you, friend. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA you aren't compatible. Better to get out now", "NTA\n\nYou will most likely lose the boyfriend over this. Why did he randomly get upset about it now? \n\n>today he got really upset and started saying he refuses to be in a house with animals because of his asthma\n\nI would seriously question a relationship if he is unable or unwilling to talk about his concerns with you.", "NTA. Your cat comes first, and if he can't accept that, then he needs to leave.", "NTA. I once rehomed cats to appease a bf I was moving in with. I regret it to this very day and feel ashamed. Worse yet, him telling me to get rid of them was just a precursor to his abusive and controlling behaviour later on. Bottom line is that cat is family and we don't give family members away like that.", "Cats>men", "I had asthma growing up and I was allergic to cats. Never had a problem with cats and asthma. \n\nKeep the fur ditch the man. NTA.\n\nDon\u2019t you dare consider abandoning furrball.", "NTA. \n\nYour cat was your responsibility long before your boyfriend came into your life. Your boyfriend knew you came with the cat. He agreed this would be okay... until he didn't anymore. \n\nWhat else is he going to promise you... until he doesn't anymore? Honestly, I would break off the relationship as much for the breach of trust as for anything else.

Has there been a dip in the hygiene or cleaning routine at your home at all? If not, he picked a weird time to complain.\n\nThe reality is this - these animals are intelligent and have emotions of their own. If you got rid of the cat, it won\u2019t understand why suddenly you decided to leave him at a shelter or with strangers. The cat has also provided positive emotional support to you in this timeframe. What would it do to him to be sent to somewhere foreign to him, or to you and your mental state without him? Your boyfriend sounds selfish not considering these possibilities.\n\nI\u2019d say have an honest conversation with him about what is really the issue here. There\u2019s allergy treatment solutions, being more proactive about cleaning, and a host of other middle grounds you both can consider. If he\u2019s still adamant that it\u2019s him or the cat, then he\u2019s made your choice for you and it\u2019s time for you and your cat to find someone more compatible. From experience, that kind of ultimatum or control won\u2019t stop there. NTA", "NTA.\n\nMy two fluffs would always win 10000000%. Anyone that makes me choose between them and my cats is getting yeeted out of my life SO damn fast.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend really isn\u2019t showing a great deal of regard for your feelings here.  It\u2019s also exposed that you potentially have quite different value systems- I would have very little respect for someone who needlessly rehomed a pet and couldn\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who was fine with it.  I\u2019d just know our values and empathy levels were too far apart.\n\nAnother poster suggested offering to do extra cleaning etc to reassure him.  I\u2019m all for compromise in a relationship, but trying to placate someone who has issued you a hurtful ultimatum is not good boundaries.  If you do this, pay close attention to his reaction: I\u2019d be concerned he\u2019d use this as a bit of a stick to beat you with and you\u2019d wind up doing all the cleaning. \n\nRandom hunch but I reckon he\u2019s actually jealous of the cat!", "NTA\n\nAt the end of the day, it sounds like you already know what you want to do, and it\u2019s not giving up your cat. You\u2019re not the asshole for breaking up with someone when they want different things from you, even if it\u2019s an old relationship.

My bf is super allergic to my cat but I have had my cat for 8 years and the bf for 2. I know exactly who I would pick if ever thrown an ultimatum like that. \n\nMy cat is my saviour.

It wont end with a cat.", "NTA, I have asthma and the fact you haven't seen the cats trigger it means it's not a factor for his asthma, this honestly sounds like a narcissist, he's using the cat as the first small step to exert control now that he believes you 2 will live together, next he'll be claiming you should cut friends out because they're \"toxic\" then family until your entirely isolated from any sort of support be it emotional, physical or financial, except for him, my suggestion is run don't walk away, the fact that he's trying to use your sympathy for him via his asthma when you know the cat doesn't cause it, is the biggest tell, he wants you to connect getting rid of the cat to being sympathetic to him, a tactic used to try and trick you into giving more importance in your mind to him and your relationship with him", "NTA. All of a sudden his has issues with the cat?", "NTA. I used to play the \u201cwhose pain is more valid\u201d game with my terrible ex. You wouldn\u2019t have ever thought of asking him to do that.

Get rid of the boyfriend, keep the cat.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m allergic to cats and dogs, I got allergy shots for two years for cats and dogs because I love animals and my asthma was so bad, I couldn\u2019t visit other people\u2019s homes. If he actually had asthma, you would know. If if he cared, he would have done something about it in the past 2.5 years. \n\nI have a cat now, and I can visit my friend\u2019s homes with pets. Allergy shots have changed my life!", "NTA... But I'd maybe talk about some compromises.

Agree that you won't let the cat on tables, counters or specific furniture.\n\nUsually anytime people have issues it has to deal with cleanliness. Personally I have had a cat and I had a GF with a cat. She let her cat go all over, their place smelled like cat litter and everything just felt gross.

I had left with him, but was in a terrible situation and made the best choice I could have at the time. I've always regretted it. Should have stuck with the cat. He was my baby and while I knew the people and I knew he was in good hands, I never saw him again.

Maybe cold feet about moving in together? I wouldn't break off the relationship. Just tell him there is no way you will be giving up the cat and see what happens. He may cave in and you guys keep the cat or want to continue living separately.

He's amazing amd has helped me through so much and I love him dearly.\n\nRecently me and boyfriend have been looking for an apartment together, and at first he was ok with the fact that kitty would be coming with us. But today he got really upset and started saying he refuses to be in a house with animals because of his asthma, which I understand...HOWEVER, he's been around my cat at my house for days on end and I've never ever seen his asthma triggered by my cat. \n\nI personally can't imagine myself living in a home without an animal, and I DEFINITELY can't see myself abandoning or giving up my cat for anyone. I also don't want to lose my relationship over this, but I'm not sure what a better solution is.

So long as I don't have to clean it or deal with it that's fine by me(I don't own a cat for this reason).", "No I'm pretty good about keeping everything clean.", "Just in time, before getting serious with moving in together.", "Thank youuuuuu", "She should not make him chose between his health and her. -is equally valid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a \"failed to discuss it earlier\"  .. BEFORE getting the cat ... situation.", "That\u2019s a different argument than \u201cthe cat comes first.\u201c", "Spinsterhood awaits.", "^ this. \n\nCat (pet) > bf (partner)", "Yes, I made the wrong choice on this one once and it has caused me heaps and heaps of pain and misery. 0/10 would not recommend second option.", "The fact that he doesn\u2019t want a cat make him a controlling asshole? That\u2019s pretty extreme\ud83d\ude00", "No. It is for people who don\u2019t know how to get along in relationships and who can\u2019t manage their own ego and learn how to compromise.", "I almost shit myself reading that", "It took about 5 years for my controlling abuser to show all his true colours, and you are spot-on here.", "Ahhh okay thank you. I\u2019m moving in with my bf soon and he says he\u2019ll be the bad guy who sprays them, but in my own apartment now it\u2019s not a problem for me", "Still a  completely valid reason to break up, and invalid reason to give up a pet you love and who is part of your family.", ">HOWEVER, he's been around my cat at my house for days on end and I've never ever seen his asthma triggered by my cat.", "Look, he's within his rights to not want to live in a home with a cat, but OP is also within their rights to not want to be forced to rehome an animal that they've come to love.", "Yea but sometimes reality sets in", "Pretty sure he's just being controlling. It sounds unhealthy.", "Ofc!", "Actually I consulted him before adopting kitty because of his asthma", "So dramatic haha. As if everyone who has a cat has to be single.", "I'm so sorry this happened to you. I hope life is kinder & happier for you now. \ud83d\udc9c", "OP writes that her cat never caused bf atshma, yet he had been around the cat for days. So it sounds like an excuse.", "Well, I am pretty extreme. \ud83d\ude06  No, I understand some people don't want a cat. I don't want a dog. But I would never expect someone to give up their pet for me. If I was moving in with someone who had a dog, I'd learn to live with a dog. It seems controlling to suddenly force someone to choose between their relationship & their pet.", ">The fact that he doesn\u2019t want a cat make him a controlling asshole? That\u2019s pretty extreme\ud83d\ude00\n\nThe fact that he okayed the original adoption, been around her and the cat for two years, and then suddenly without any warning pulled a 180 and started demanding she rehome her cat absolutely makes him controlling.  Maybe offering a discussion on this is acceptable as he has a legitimate concern, however demanding it and being upset out of the blue makes him TA", "No, it's for people who are happy with themselves. Weird take you have there.", "People will hate on it but let's be real, you need to make the places like counters not fun for your cat to be. But also give treats to them when they go on the ground.", "And he was fine w it", "So youi discussed getting a cat while NOT living together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut did you discuss what would happen when you wanted to move together at some point? And: did you know about his allergies?", "He was dating her three years before she got the cat. That should count for something.  if she already had the cat when she met him, completely different story.", "Yes I clearly said in the post that he was completely fine w my cat coming w us and also yes", "Do you think it changed the love she feels for the cat, and the amount of help the cat gives her, just because she knew the boyfriend longer?", "This seems to be the bit that some people are missing; he was totally onboard until he just suddenly wasn't. It's concerning behaviour.", "Thank youuu"]}
