{"id": 9164, "submission_id": "10tvob4", "title": "AITA for not sitting with my fiancee during a transatlantic flight?", "selftext": "So. My fiancee has a bad fear of flying. Whenever we fly together she takes one of two options: \n\n1. She drinks before the flight so she's tipsy and less scared\n2. She takes the local equivalent of a Xanax which basically means she sleeps most of the flight\n\nAs we are going on a transatlantic flight (14H) she went for option 2 with the hope of sleeping all the time. We normally always sit together and she holds my hand - I distract her with stories and we watch movies together... but here's the kicker: I have a business class ticket from work and she booked an economy ticket to join me on the trip. Her perspective is that I should give up the business class ticket and we should just sit together in economy, where my perspective is that it would be a huge waste of money and comfort to do so. Especially since she will likely be sleeping most of the flight I think it wouldn't make sense for both of us to sit in economy. Her perspective is that it's more important for me to sit next to her when she's afraid.\n\nOn the outgoing flight, I checked in using business class, sat with her in economy during take off and then gave my business class seat to her so she could sleep comfortably during the full flight. I sat in economy throughout the flight. \n\nWe are now about to go on the return flight and as I have an important meeting on Monday I need to be rested and suggested that I use the business class seat this time, checking in on her every hour and using the in-flight wifi so she can reach me if there's any emergency. \n\nAITA here for not just giving up the seat? Curious what other people would do in this situation.\n\nEDIT to clarify some stuff:\n1. Yes this a business trip for me. We thought we could upgrade my fiancee before the flight at a reduced fare but the prices went through the roof. We took a holiday after the business trip.\n2. My fiancee would be ok to sit in economy together - she's not \"just trying to get the business class ticket\". My thinking on the outgoing flight was that she would be able to sleep all the time in the business class seat, where in economy that's harder with the lack of recline etc.\n3. It's easy to move back and forth between business and economy. On the outgoing flight we sat next to each other whenever we weren't sleeping and my plan is to do the same now regardless of who sits where. My fiancee would just prefer to sit next to each other all the time.", "created_utc": 1675555990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tvob4/aita_for_not_sitting_with_my_fiancee_during_a/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it\u2019s perfectly fair to share the business tickets and you to take your turn in business on the way back.", "So is her fear of flying worse in Economy? In that case she does have a fear of something else I think? Anyway, NTA for not giving up your seat. You already did once, so now it's yours. Tbh I would not have given up that seat on the way to your destination either. She chose to come along and I assume she knew you were going BC. You are going there for work, and BC means a lot more rest for the work you're supposed to do there!?", "This is fair - she handled it once without you, it\u2019s reasonable for you to have a turn being comfortable now. NTA.", "NTA- she had the business seat on the way there and only fair you have it on the way back. Sounds like she has a good plan to sleep the whole time and has a way to contact you if something goes wrong", "NTA\n\nShe chose to tag along and she chose which seat class she purchased, knowing which you would be in. And then you were thoughtful enough to give up your more expensive seat on the way to destination. She can most certainly air in the seat she paid for on the way home.", "NTA\n\nYou did the nice thing on the way out, I think she can give you the seat in the way home. Just let the crew know that she\u2019s a nervous flyer and they\u2019ll keep an eye on her.", "NTA and your company paid for business class so you would be rested and able to perform your job well, not for the comfort of your partner. You should be in business class as per their intentions.", "NTA", "Info:  you said your business class ticket is through work.  Is this a business trip for you?  If it is a business trip, and she\u2019s that scared of flying, why did she tag along?", "NTA. I think you allowing her to sleep on the flight there in business class was very kind considering it was a 14hr flight. I think your compromise was reasonable in checking in on her and for you to want the business class seat on the way back. And everyone saying business class isn't great, on a transatlantic flight, it absolutely is. You have privacy and can lie flat.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave her the seat for the outgoing flight and now want to use it for the return flight. She proved on the outgoing flight that she was fully capable of handling being separated when she had the upgraded seat so her claims of being afraid to fly alone ring hollow.\n\nEnd of the day, this was a business trip and your SO needs to understand and respect that. Your employer paid for the business class ticket so that you would be well rested and able to perform your job duties.", "I wonder what her attitude would be if you gave her business class both times, since she seemed to manage alright when she had business class on the way out. \n\nNTA because she seems to just want business class, or you would have been making this post on the way out instead of on the way in.", "INFO:  is she concerned about being by herself while impaired?  Is this a safety issue for her?", "NTA if you're going to be separated anyway and she's going to sleep. But why can't you both fly economy, if you were going to take a turn there anyway and she's much more comfortable with you beside her?", "NTA , except maybe to your employer,  because where they totally cool with your finance tagging along? If I paid for a business class ticket for an employee and their fianc\u00e9 tagged along giving them grief, I would not be happy.", "NTA\n\nSo... she was fine with sitting separately from you when she got the business class seat?\n\nShe got the comfy seat one way; you get it coming home.  That's called fair.", "NAH\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at play here and I think this is a no win scenario. \n\nYou admit that it\u2019s easier to sleep in business (and it 100% is!) So if she\u2019s in economy she likely won\u2019t sleep through the plane\u2026which is why she wants you with her. If she\u2019s in economy, she won\u2019t sleep. If she can\u2019t sleep through it, she doesn\u2019t want to be without you. \n\nIt is easy to move between business and economy\u2026if you\u2019re the one with the business class ticket. If she has an economy ticket and is feeling nervous she might not be able to go up to your seat. Also if you\u2019re checking on her every hour, how will you be more rested? \n\nExplain the situation to the flight attendant and hopefully they will let her move up to business class with you. \n\nGood luck", "ESH. Feel like there's two separate problems here. \n\nOne is her fear of flying. You should have just sat in economy with her man.\n\nThe other is sharing this business class seat. If the issue is the fear of flying and she's going to be flying alone either way, why does she care if she does it in economy or business?", "YTA. We'd both fly business or economy.", "INFO. Was this a business trip? Why different tickets?", "I really don\u2019t think being drugged and unconscious and alone during a fourteen hour flight is a good idea\u2026 sounds like she is making herself kinda vulnerable and you do hear stories\u2026\n\nOP, it sounds like you *could* sit with her-if you wanted to. You are being a bad BF. YTA", "YTA\nDue respect, this post smells fake. Here\u2019s why:\nA 14hour flight suggests Los Angeles to Dubai or New York to Tokyo. Those types of flights? Sold out. You don\u2019t get to move to economy to sit with her for takeoff and then waltz back up the aisle to business class. Also, for a transoceanic flight, the Berlin Wall drops between economy and the front part of the plane. \n\nI\u2019m more inclined to think this is a pre-trip justification for buying the GF and economy seat rather than a business class one.\nAn empty seat conveniently next to the GF in economy? Hahaha.", "Imo YTA. Economy isn't that bad, holy shit. Picking the business class ticket and having your wife be in coach is almost exactly the plot to that Seinfeld episode where Elaine and Jerry take a flight (the Airport). Spoiler alert, Jerry does NOT come off well in that episode! You can either sleep in Economy (the horror! the horror!) or shell out for a business class ticket. \n\nI would definitely feel resentful of being in coach while my husband was in business class, *especially* if I had a terrible time flying. \n\nIf I had a phobia and thought the plane was going to crash in a horrific wreck at any moment, I'd want my husband next to me so we'd at least die horrifically together.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t need business class seat to be rested. I know wayyyyyyyy too many business men making long flights to fall for that. You know how your wife gets and should do whatever you can to make her more comfortable. Don\u2019t be selfish. And in the future, I\u2019d recommend y\u2019all plan better to avoid this.", "YTA if you can afford to give up the seat, \n\nYour wife needs you dude, she cant handle flying, a fear a lot of people have, sheesh, trade your seat with someone sitting next to her, shes going to be unconcious for 12 hours next to strangers? you should really really be there", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
