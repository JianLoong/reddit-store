At the beginning of the month I texted the group chat I have with all my friends to ask if they\u2019d all be free on the last saturday of the month (yesterday). I explained that I was asking early to do that everyone would keep in mind to keep that day free. Everyone said yes. \n\nThroughout the past couple weeks i\u2019ve mentioned the plan here and there to get an opinion on what everyone wanted to do. Last week I texted everyone again to confirm they were all coming and to finalize things. My friend (20s f) doesn\u2019t respond for a couple days and then texts me privately saying that she made plans with one of her uni friends and if i could push it back to sunday. this annoyed me because she\u2019s done this before and we\u2019ve already talked abt it. plus considering that it\u2019s my bday and i asked weeks in advance, i was a little hurt. still, i decided to just get over it and see if everyone would be available for sunday instead. I kinda realized then that it was a little inconvenient because we wouldn\u2019t be able to stay out as long as I initially wanted to. I was able to work around it and planned to just leave earlier. \n\nMy friend wanted us to get ready together so on friday I asked her what time she wanted to come over but got no response. I had also planned to go to my boyfriends to help him get ready. We all planned to meet at his house so I was just going to get ready with her first then we\u2019d both go to his place. This morning i texted her again to confirm she was coming over and reminded her we\u2019d be going to my bfs place an hour before we all meet up and leave. She then tells me that she\u2019s working till an hour before we\u2019re supposed to leave and asks if we\u2019re still going to get ready. I told her she can come to his place but other than that idk what to do. she said she didn\u2019t want to do that and that i should\u2019ve told her earlier because now i\u2019m ditching her for my bf. AITA?\n\nEDIT: she was also supposed to borrow some of my clothes for her costume and I bought her some accessories for it but I figured since we\u2019re all meeting at my bfs place anyways she could just change real quick there and leave her stuff in his car", "created_utc": 1667146483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhi7ii/aita_for_not_being_flexible_with_my_birthday_plans/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told everyone a month beforehand and even changed the day to accommodate her even though it\u2019s your birthday. You also tried to get in contact with her to confirm these plans but she didn\u2019t answer, that\u2019s on her. She can\u2019t expect everyone to work around her schedule when she won\u2019t even communicate with you.", "NTA. She couldn't keep her plans with you and didn't tell you, and then expected you to move everything just for her. Your world doesn't revolve around her. She needs to get her act together.", "NAH, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nScheduling things with a group of people can be a nightmare.  You gave them plenty of notice, but what you should do next time is not ask for a group consensus (always an exercise in frustration), but, this being your b-day, choose something you want to do.\n\nSo, if you want to plan an event, plan the event and tell everyone when and where.  At most maybe give people a couple of dates to choose from, if you haven't been able to give proper notice.", "i suppose it is rude though. that\u2019s another reason why i won\u2019t be doing something like that in the future", "a couple other friends that I forgot to ask in advance weren\u2019t able to make it on the saturday either so I figured asking if sunday would work for everyone wouldn\u2019t hurt. it ended up working out for everyone but if it conflicted with anyone else i would\u2019ve stuck to the original date.

I had 3 Halloween party invites for last night that have been in place since August. So these other people may have turned down other fun plans as they had committed to your bday. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to beat you up on this. Just pointing out that one person being a flake can have some trickle down impacts on everyone else if you cater to them. And it doesn\u2019t really teach friend that the world does not in fact revolve around them.", "It was nice of you and everyone else to be able to change their plans but you\u2019re NTA if she can\u2019t get her life together for an event.  Not your problem.", "yes i agree with you. i\u2019ve done this too many times for her so i think she expects it of me now"]}
