Me and my boyfriend have known each other since we were 9 and went through high school together. We only confessed our feelings to each other in the middle of senior year.\n\nHis mother used to like me when I was a devout kid, though now thinks I\u2019m too sacrilegious and provocative. She thinks I\u2019m corrupting her \u201clittle boy\u201d even though he was never devout to begin with. She puts on the facade of loving me in front of my mother and him at times. Though behind their back she would tell me her opinions or be outlandish.\n\nI love baking in my free time or when I\u2019m stressed, so I would bake for hours at a time. A couple of days back, I just wanted to bake a cake for my boyfriend as he has been feeling quite overwhelmed recently with studies and prospects. So, I spent the night baking when he was at his studying as I hoped to cheer him up. I made a \u201cpassion\u201d cake that was everything fire as he has been talking about what his passion is and if he really has what it takes.\n\nI put a surprise in the middle of the cake, which was an edible remake of our first letter that we wrote each other at 12 for our homework (this took me so long to find and make).\n\nAfter around six hours, I took a nap and went to school. I came back to find my boyfriend (who has a key) and his mother who came with him once a week.\n\nI unpack and go to the refrigerator to check how the cake turned out and to give it to him. Though, I found a couple of slices cut out, with the letter gone & cake pieces all over. I was really upset to say the least and couldn\u2019t believe it, but I knew it was his mother as she always went straight to my fridge to try my leftovers.\n\nIt may sound like an overreaction, but I felt like I was on the verge of crying as I really wanted to give it to him and thought I executed it well. His mother came to the kitchen and saw the cake i placed on the table. Started to overly apologise when she realised what she had done, even though I knew it in my gut that she did it on purpose.\n\nI just ignored her and my boyfriend was in the living room so he didn\u2019t really hear much nor cared to listen in as we always talked. My boyfriend asked me if it would be alright if his mother could stayed over in the guest room as it was late and she couldn\u2019t drive at night (eyesight problems). I tell him no and that I would much prefer if she didn\u2019t. He asked me why I was upset and I couldn\u2019t be asked to go back and forth, I told him to just let her leave my apartment. Meanwhile, I knew she was listening in as she loves to hear us go back & forth.\n\nHe told me that i was being unreasonable and that his mother has been nothing, but sweet. I just kept on being dismissive and he left to go drive her to his apartment and stay there, even though he was supposed to stay at mine that night. He has been quite dismissive as he was already in immense stress.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670797871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjcgn5/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_his_mother/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she left cake pieces around for you to clean up?!? Oh, hell no! \n\nDemand your key back from her.

Better yet, see if you can get the locks changed in your place, and don't give her a key.", "\"Your mother stole from me. Yes, she said words that sounded like an apology, but it was clear that she was not truly repentant of her sin. And if she's not truly repentant, it is impossible for me to offer forgiveness. When she truly repents of her sin, she can demonstrate it by offering a true apology (which includes a detailed explanation of why she intentionally chose to destroy the replica of the letter, since that obviously was gratuitous and unrelated to any desire for food), offering restitution to make it up to me, and offer me some kind of assurance that she understands the depth of what she did wrong and is so horrified by her behavior that she will never repeat it. Then, when I'm confident that she can be trusted in my apartment, I will allow her to come back.\"\n\nNTA.

It sounds like no one will ever be good enough for her \"little boy\" who is a grown ass 20 year old man. Your real problem isn't his mom, though, it's him because he doesn't see her behavior as a problem.\n\nWhy on earth is she even there at your apartment?! If my boyfriend came over on a regular basis WITH HIS MOTHER AND without even telling me in advance, AND expecting her to be able to SPEND THE NIGHT (gross!!) all kinds of alarm bells would be going off. Actually, I would've broken up with him by now.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

He sounds like a mamas boy, and those boys don\u2019t easily change.", "NTA, but you should really have communicated with your boyfriend.  From his perspective, it has to seem like you have irrationally attacked his mother.  You've given him no reason or ability to understand the situation, so you've added to his apparently already stressed condition.  \n\nYou have also assumed motivations and feelings from your boyfriend's mother.  Perhaps you have good reason to know what here \"true motives\" are, but you didn't provide any other than innuendo and assumptions.  It's POSSIBLE she didn't do it for the reasons you think she did.  However, she was certainly in the wrong for cutting into your cake - no one should cut into an uncut cake without understanding its purpose - that's just common sense.  \n\nIn short, you were justified in being upset about the situation, but you gave your boyfriend no opportunity to understand the situation.  Based on what you outlined, he has to be absolutely bewildered by this situation, which will certainly translate into more friction.", "NTA. However, you can't expect your boyfriend to support your decision to kick his mother out if you didn't bother to explain what she did. Is he supposed to be a mind-reader? Tell him, see how he reacts then make your decision about whether your relationship with him is worth pursuing, given his mother's attitude towards you, which, by the way, is extremely hypocritical.", "NTA, although I am curious why you didn't just tell him what his mother did so he had a reason for kicking her out. You maybe have to ask yourself is the relationship with the boyfriend worth the hassle of having to put up with his mother.", "NTA - it\u2019s your place and it\u2019s absolutely okay to set a boundary that she doesn\u2019t come around without asking you and doesn\u2019t help herself to food from your fridge. She\u2019s not your mom, and you\u2019re an adult - it\u2019s very disrespectful of her to treat your home as hers to walk into.\n\nBut your boyfriend needs to understand that a welcome for him does not equal a welcome for her. He can meet his mother at his own place or at hers, there isn\u2019t any need for her to make your home her business - so if he won\u2019t help you to insist she respect you then you need to think hard about whether you can live with that; it might be you need to take his key back if he doesn\u2019t get the point.", "NTA\n\nTell him what she did.  Take back his key so he can only be in your place when you're home.  And tell him that his mother isn't allowed in your home without you any longer.\n\nPay attention to how he reacts.  If he tries to blame you or make excuses for his mother or argue with you, just dump him and change your locks.  \n\nNeither he nor his mother respect you.  And if he does anything other than apologize and hand you your key, it's a sign that he's not ever going to have your back.  In that case, get out.\n\nI highly suspect that you've been in this relationship for so long that there's other mistreatment that's going on that you just think of as being normal.  (Hint:. Your BF's Momma coming with him to spend the night at your place once a week is definitely not normal.)", "NTA, but you do need to tell him why you were upset. To him you were being unreasonable because he had no added information to work from, had you explained the situation and why you were upset and wanted her gone, he probably would\u2019ve reacted differently and not left in a huff.", "If you want to be petty, take her \"apology\" at face value and use it as ammunition. \"She couldn't tell the difference between a special custom cake and 'leftovers', so I'm worried for her safety. What if she accidentally eats dish detergent or bleach? No, no, it's better that she not be here.\"\n\nNTA but tell your boyfriend what she did, if you haven't already.", "Stop letting his mom in your apt. Don't know why you'd do that in the first place.
