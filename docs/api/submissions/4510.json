When she truly repents of her sin, she can demonstrate it by offering a true apology (which includes a detailed explanation of why she intentionally chose to destroy the replica of the letter, since that obviously was gratuitous and unrelated to any desire for food), offering restitution to make it up to me, and offer me some kind of assurance that she understands the depth of what she did wrong and is so horrified by her behavior that she will never repeat it.

Perhaps you have good reason to know what her \"true motives\" are, but you didn't provide any other than innuendo and assumptions.  It's POSSIBLE she didn't do it for the reasons you think she did.  However, she was certainly in the wrong for cutting into your cake - no one should cut into an uncut cake without understanding its purpose - that's just common sense.  \n\nIn short, you were justified in being upset about the situation, but you gave your boyfriend no opportunity to understand the situation.

He can meet his mother at his own place or at hers, there isn\u2019t any need for her to make your home her business - so if he won\u2019t help you to insist she respect you then you need to think hard about whether you can live with that; it might be you need to take his key back if he doesn\u2019t get the point.", "NTA\n\nTell him what she did.

In that case, get out.\n\nI highly suspect that you've been in this relationship for so long that there's other mistreatment that's going on that you just think of as being normal.  (Hint:. Your BF's Momma coming with him to spend the night at your place once a week is definitely not normal.)", "NTA, but you do need to tell him why you were upset.
