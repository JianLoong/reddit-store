It's not unusual for a 19 year old to be oblivious to the feelings of others.  She will outgrow it eventually.  Your parents are really the bad ones for enabling that.  You are not doing anything wrong.\n\nYou mention her going after your prized possessions but didn't elaborate.  Did she steal from you?", "Wrong forum you want personal advice\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/", "There's no real conflict here. You're looking for an advice sub, and this isn't it.", "I don't understand why you are spending any time around her at all.  She's never going to be the sister you want.  Find people who appreciate you for who you are.  And if you are still living in the same house, do whatever it takes to get out of there.", "Your little sister sounds horrible. Now there\u2019s two sides to every story but from this POV - you\u2019re NTA. Sisters shouldn\u2019t call each other names, ruin each other\u2019s possessions. That\u2019s hateful behavior. Anyone with basic human decency could understand that. I\u2019m sorry you are going through it.", "NTA. But some suggestions:\n\n-don\u2019t loan her things \n-don\u2019t buy her things \n-just generally avoid her \n-definitely don\u2019t have her over to your place \n\nIn other words, distance. Not necessarily no contact/block, just ignore her.", "If you can't move out, don't \"keep trying\" with her. I would act like she doesn't exist. Don't let her rope you into her nonsense.\n\nGet a trunk or some other similar box to lock your things in so she doesn't have access to them. Maybe even a storage unit so they're not even in the house."]}
