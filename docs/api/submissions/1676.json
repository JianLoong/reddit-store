I should clarify, we arent forcing her but we are offering her resources and opportunities. She refuses to go to therapy for anything and refuses to go to any doctors at all what soever. We have tried for years to just understand what she needs but she doesn't tell anyone anything. I can see why if it's because of us trying to get her help but I'm the first one to actually say anything about her self diagnosing. I understand she does feel pain and she has painful/irregular periods. I just don't like her self diagnosing and saying it's worse than mine when there is a good chance it's not. I've always done everything I can for her when she says she's in pain  including taking her kids to and from school and helping out when her hubs can't. I just don't like my pain being undermined.\n\nAlso, thank you for the words of encouragement. I'm going on my 4th incision surgery soon. We've pretty much run out different meds and combinations. The only left is arm implant BC and have meds thst make you go into menopause but I have had really bad reactions to every type of bc and I really don't want to go into menopause. I have a long time before I hit that age. I don't want to go early."]}
