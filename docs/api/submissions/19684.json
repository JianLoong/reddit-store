While I get it's not a great thing, bisexual women are constantly played down due to the fact they are attracted to both and are seen in a more sexualized image than most. These kinds of rumors can be really damaging, especially if there is someone she likes and they're a woman. \n\nIt's not the \\*preferred\\* way to go about it, at all, and it can be damaging to both her life and yours, since you yourself are a lesbian.

You're not telling her she can't use the label lesbian if she really was. She's falsely claiming to be one for the sole reason of dispelling rumors. If she really did find out she was a lesbian, then we would have an issue with you gatekeeping the label. But that's not what's going on here.
