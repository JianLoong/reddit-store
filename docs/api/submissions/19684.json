While I get it's not a great thing, bisexual women are constantly played down due to the fact they are attracted to both and are seen in a more sexualized image than most. These kinds of rumors can be really damaging, especially if there is someone she likes and they're a woman. \n\nIt's not the \\*preferred\\* way to go about it, at all, and it can be damaging to both her life and yours, since you yourself are a lesbian. So, I'd suggest sitting her down and talking to her about how doing this would make you feel, and that you're open to figuring out a plan that respects your sexuality while also helps her. \n\nDoes that make sense?", "> as a lesbian i was quite offended that she thinks she can toss our community's label around just to protect her social standings, it's hurtful and also feeds into the stigma that lesbians can be \"changed\" to like men  \n\nYour feelings are valid... but gate keepers are rarely a net positive.  \n\n> i'm very close to talking to her and saying that it's not right, but i don't know if it's too harsh.
