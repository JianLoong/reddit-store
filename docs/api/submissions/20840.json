As many have suggested, it may be because they want something, or there's something do to with the will, but it might also be that his father is grappling with his mortality for the first time in the wake of his own dad's death and has some regrets.  Whatever the reason, you are all old enough to decide for yourselves whether you want to have a relationship with them, and if so, what kind.\n\nIt might be helpful for you to sit down together as a family and discuss their sudden change of heart and your individual feelings about it.  If some of you want a relationship where others don't, it would be helpful going forward if you know each other's boundaries.

Didn\u2019t think of the morality aspect of things until you guy\u2019s mentioned it & it clicked. It makes perfect sense! I was \u201cblinded\u201d by my own feelings to not have seen the obvious. I\u2019m thinking that is exactly what it is - his father is getting older, his kids are all adults, he lost his dad & maybe just maybe he took a good hard look. Great advice on sitting everyone down & all just talking about how they feel & making sure everyone knows that the door is open & they can choose whether to shut it or walk through or a little bit of both!", "If that\u2019s the reason for his turnaround, then I am so golden with that!!! I will make sure I tell him again that he absolutely should explore the rekindling if that\u2019s what he wants.

Could be totally wrong though, the reality is we only see what they show which sadly is very little!", "Why are you guys still keeping in contact with them again??", "I wouldn't rush into a relationship.

Let's do this again!\" when they see you but never reach out.", "You \u201cthink\u201d but it\u2019s actually worth \u201cknowing\u201d. Maybe they should give him the money but keep for themselves? And now try to at least get him involved so DH would feel guilty when it finally blow up in their faces.  \nCheck it op. Just to be sure. And your kids are old enough to decide for themselves.

They sound awful, I\u2019m sorry.", "I don\u2019t understand why you are entertaining this at all.

But I would want to read a copy of the will... just in case.", "It's simple: have you heard an apology from them? If not, scrap that. But even if they did apologize it sounds like a sure recipe for more heartache for your husband so either way I'd give it a pass. It doesn't seem like that branch of the family was missed all these years by him or you.", "NTA. If your husband wanted a relationship with this folks, he could say so. The fact that its \"If I did it, he would go along but wouldn't go without me\" (paraphrasing) I understand to mean he doesn't care enough about these people to put in effort for a relationship.", "NTA.  If they really wanted to make amends, they'd be addressing the past and, you know, apologizing.\n\nThey can't just pick it up now and pretend that the last 22 years didn't happen.  It would be a different matter if they had invited you and told you that they'd been wrong in the past and wanted to start over and try again.  They didn't.  They're hoping for instalove without repercussions for any past actions.", "NTA and OP, most of us are as suspicious as you are and really need you to check with the probate court to find out what was in that will. Something very strange about 22 years of silence and now you are the prodigals returning? It is just too far off.", "NTA\u2026 these people showed you exactly who they are.

Nobody goes from excluding you utterly to suddenly wanting you in their life without reason. Until you know what that reason is, keep your emotional distance", "NTA. But just a thought, could it be that the grandpa had an issue with OP or didn't approve? Now he's gone and they want to reconnect.

If so, why would you make an effort to include all that drama and any that may come in the future because they want it? Why do they want it? Why should you trust them? They had every single day for 22 years to change their mind and contact you and... crickets. They owe you a ***massive*** apology before anything should move forward and then a huge and very convincing explanation of why they have oh so suddenly changed their minds.", "NTA\n\nBut I would ask them point blank what changed?  Why do they want to start getting together after 22 years?  \n\nYour behavior won\u2019t change, but it\u2019ll be interesting to see what they say.", "NTA, what are they looking for, help as the age? Money?  What is the excuse for what they did to you and your family.", "NTA", "NTA", "My thought as well. Did grandpa leave moat of his estate to husband, so now \"Dad\" wants a relationship? Money and greed often create these massive shifts.", "If you reject them, be sure to tell the wife how ludicrous it is to cut family off just because one of them swore once. You see, I think FIL told a very different story to his wife. One of the dangers of communicating through a single hostile person is that they have full control over what everybody else gets to know. Honestly, the whole going NC over swearing sounds like a pretext to cut contact. He never intended to have a relationship with his son's family. He was looking for something, anything to justify cutting you off. If not swearing, it would have been something else, something just as ridiculously minor. I suspect he always viewed your husband as a threat to his reputation and marriage, somebody who might reveal unpleasant truths.", "Is it possible the will did leave something to your husband and he just hasn\u2019t been informed about it?", "If you\u2019re in the US just know that wills are public record & once it has been filed you could get a copy for yourself to see what was in it.", "FWIW it was just my gut but I got this immediate impression of like, you were a single mom and your partner stepped up to be a parent with you..\n meanwhile partner's dad was a deadbeat who was present off and on.\n\nI think your relationship to his son might have been for him to process in part because his son was a reminder of the kind of man he should have been, and you were a reminder of the kind of pain he caused. Combine that with misogyny and stubbornness and you get decades of unfair resentment. But in that time and especially with his dad's death, maybe he wishes he had done better instead. I certainly hope his motivation is remorse as he should definitely feel remorseful.\n\nThat said, he hurt your partner, you, and your kids. His reasons, if he ever shares them, might help you understand whether his intentions have shifted but don't excuse his past. It's unrealistic to expect that he ever becomes truly like family to you or your kids, after this long. Honestly I think it's a long shot with his son. But you could probably all be cordial and something good might come out of that, like closure for your partner. Personally I would be very guarded in case the inlaws are trying to get something out of your husband or you. Personally I'm really not big on bio family with mine having been abusive or absent a lot, so if it were me i would probably just focus on what kind of support my husband told me he needed.or if I were your husband I would process grief about grandpa with him if I felt any, and tbh just kinda wish him a nice life and move on\n\noh BTW you're NTA", "I would get in touch with the estate lawyer if you can. It could be an enlightening read.", "Exactly, how would they know what the Will contained until it was actually read. That information is confidential until the deceased's lawyer reveals it. It sounds like they may have had a rude awakening at the 'reading'.", "The lawyer would have contacted her husband if he was mentioned in the will - it's a responsibility in legal terms. (I found out my grandmother had passed and left me money from an ad in my local paper. That's how far the lawyers need to go to confirm that legatees are not swindled.)", "Maybe the lawyer has been trying to do so via the dad because of outdated contact info and dad and stepmom have been deliberately keeping them away? OP, I\u2019d have your hubby follow up directly with the lawyers about the will. Even if you all don\u2019t even want any part of a potential inheritance, the reconnecting business is suuuper fishy and the timing of it points to will issues. You should investigate if only to see if that\u2019s what\u2019s behind this sudden attempt at a relationship.", "Yes, but not while the family is still going through the process of burial/cremation. The lawyer would have contacted the people listed in the Will when the estate is being finalized. The whole gathering to spread ashes and have the Will read sounds like something the family arranged assuming they knew who was in it. It would not be the lawyer's responsibility to ensure everyone affected would be in attendance."]}
