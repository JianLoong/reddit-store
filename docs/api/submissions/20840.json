I reconnected with an old friend & as they say \u201cthat\u2019s a wrap\u201d \u2013 we started dating & he immediately connected with my daughter & has raised her as his own for the past 22 years. (He\u2019s an incredible man!) We also had a son together, got married but instead of a wedding, we bought a house & decided to wait until we were more financially secure for the wedding.\n \nMy husbands father was absent from his life starting around the age of 12. His father re-married & had a new family. My husband was always an afterthought to them & naturally, it has hurt him all these years. \n\nHis father made it clear he didn\u2019t like me the 1st time I met him because in conversation with my husband, away from his sisters, I swore in a joking manner. His father overheard it. After we left, his father called my husband & told him how bad it was for me to have sworn & how offensive it is. To be clear, his father swears & that is okay because he is a man, apparently women shouldn\u2019t swear? The invitations from them never came again & it was more or less like we just didn\u2019t exist with the exception of Christmas gifts \u2013 only for our son, nothing for our daughter.\n \nWe invited them to every birthday party & they never once showed up. I threw my husband a BIG 30th birthday party & they declined coming. We had that delayed wedding (it was amazing & beautiful!) & they declined the invite 9 months in advance. They\u2019ve only \u201cmet\u201d our children 2 times when they were little & they are now 22 & 18. (This a the very short abridged version of the slights through the years)\n \nMy husbands grandfather passed away & his father planned a dinner & invited us & I would never allow my husband to miss that. I felt like I was in the twilight zone \u2013 the 2 people who previously treated me & my children like pond scum & my husband as a stranger magically loved spending time with us. They wanted us to go back to their house, want to make plans to do \u201cthings\u201d together, dinner this, plans that.  \n\nAfter wearing a \u201cScarlet Letter\u201d for over 22 years now, I can\u2019t even fathom starting a relationship with them. My husband & kids are welcomed to have a relationship with them but Momma Bear will NEVER forget the hurt feelings of her little girl & her husband as they continuously slighted us as a family not to mention my son who couldn\u2019t pick them out of a crowd. \n\nAITA for not wanting anything to do with them knowing that my husband won\u2019t in turn? (If I made a point of having the relationship, he would be on board but because I\u2019m not, he won\u2019t be) basically, am I being selfish & putting my feelings of disappointment before his?", "created_utc": 1687982145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ljc0b/aita_i_dont_want_to_start_having_a_relationship/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is something \"off\" about this whole thing.  Like they're being nice all of a sudden because they want something.  I'd be keeping my guard up all the time.  The last thing I'm sure you'd want is for your husband to open up and then end up being hurt even more.", "nta.  they were extremely rude and excluded you and your family and made it clear they didn\u2019t want to be around you.  your husband\u2019s father also has some awful misogynistic views and double standards, which is reason enough to not want him around you and your family.", "NTA\n\nHe's free to build that relationship if he wants. But it's insanely unreasonable to expect you to want anything to do with them. Personally, I'd have just acted as if they had already passed, and thought nothing beyond that.", "NTA, you're already entitled to ask where is your medal because you didn't RSVP with a curse.\n\nBUT: your hb seems a pretty supportive person and someone who cares for your feelings. On the other hand, his dad's family is horrible. Hence supporting him for a single dinner would probably suffice either for him to realize it definitively (just think the different treatment they'll surely give to your son and your daughter) or for them to decide they don't really want a relationship/doing something that would reveal their true colors even more.\n\nLong story short: by accepting the invitation you would probably get a happy and never resentful/what if husband AND never seeing them again.\nAlso: hope you're still on the sworing side and same for your daughter :)", "NTA you\u2019re not responsible for creating a relationship for your husband either. If he wants it he can have it, but if it hinges on your efforts, then it doesn\u2019t seem very important to him.", "NTA - I\u2019d stay away too", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to reconnect to a AH father-in-law. Stand your grounds and stay away, there\u2019s no law you have to forgive him.", "NTA. And as your kids are now adults, you can be honest about why. Let them know, if they ask, that you are fine with whatever decisions they make regarding a relationship with this side of the family but you will not put in the effort and explain why.", "NTA and maybe I've spent too much time on Reddit but did the grandfather leave your husband (or your children) anything? Or tie some assets into your husband having a  relationship with his father? I understand why you are torn- your husband sounds like a great guy and probably wants some sort of relationship with them but... A complete turn around after this many years is really suss.  Extreme caution from everyone interacting with them and look into the grandfather's situation.", "INFO: do you think those hurt feelings your husband has carried with him for years over feeling unimportant to his dad, could be repaired by having a relationship with him now?", "My first thought is that there is something in the grandfather's will that mom and dad are conniving to get. Be careful", "Very fishy. So does someone need a transplant? Or has misogynistic Daddy Dearest been affected by a clause in the Grandfather's  will and wants to get at it?\n\nWe have nothing to do with my husband's side of the family for pretty much all of the same shit here.  I'd be on guard the minute they rock up at my door for the same reasons.", "People don\u2019t just change like that, especially people like your FIL. I smell something fishy. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf it was important to your husband to spend time with them, he\u2019d do it regardless of your decision, especially since you\u2019ve clearly stated he and the kids are welcome to.\n\nIf he follows your lead, it\u2019s a choice he\u2019s actively making. Do not feel you have to fake a relationship with them so your husband can have a (no doubt equally fake) relationship with them.", "NTA. As you said your husband can if he wants to. Show him and make it 1000% clear that he and your son can reform a bond with his dad guilt free. I can only assume that your father inlaw heart has soften after the loss of his dad. He wants to be closer to the family he has left.", "NTA for not wanting anything to do with them.\n\nBUT, I would suggest, for your husband's sake and only because your kids are older, be civil and try.  If the kids were younger, I'd be saying h to the ell no.  But since they're older, do this for your husband, at least a little bit, just to see where it leads.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
