He basically asked for your permission to date her. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be out.", "This is not normal behavior.

You're both new in the city, and don't have many friends, and this 37-year-old married man is choosing to hang out with a teen with a fake ID rather than his wife?

Most guys in that age range won\u2019t have anything in common with a teen and nothing good will come of this.
