They\u2019re kind of mean to me and I don\u2019t think they treat me well. But they also think I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nFor context I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m on the autism spectrum. One of the things I\u2019m not good at are social cues. For example I think greeting someone when you\u2019re in a space with them feels awkward when you\u2019re both doing your own separate things. I don\u2019t feel a need to greet people unless I want to engage in a conversation. My step mom got really mad at me because I didn\u2019t greet her enough. \n\nI\u2019m too blunt or impolite when I don\u2019t mean to be. I\u2019m getting better at this now but like god the pandemic really impacted my ability to read social cues. My Dad and step mom don\u2019t believe I\u2019m autistic. But my Brother is diagnosed so I come to him with a lot of my issues because I know he can relate in some way. \n\nThey get mad at me whenever I talk to my brother and my mom cause then they get mad at my dad. Cause I\u2019ll go to my brother for comfort after something bad happens and then he\u2019ll confront my dad. (My mom does the same thing but she stopped after seeing it did no good for me) My Dad and my Step Mom say I\u2019m betraying them by doing this. I don\u2019t know if im the asshole or not cause whenever I say I feel hurt my dad says \u201clook at how upset your step mom is she\u2019s just as hurt as you are\u201d \n\nI apologize and try to fix whatever mistakes I made but it never feels like enough. My Dad and Step mom always bring up the past and old issues. I feel like no matter what I do it\u2019s never enough and I fuck up in one way or another. I really just want an unbiased opinion cause I can\u2019t tell and my dad tells me I have a victim complex. \n\nTLDR: My step mom thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I don\u2019t understand social cues, I ask my adult autistic brother for advice and he yells at my dad and then my dad and step mom yell at me saying I\u2019m betraying them", "created_utc": 1682488887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12z87pt/aita_for_talking_to_my_mom_and_brother_about_my/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This caused my step family to not like me and they get upset at me often. I will talk to my brother and mom about this and they\u2019ll get upset at my dad.

They deserve to be called out for their behaviour, and they\u2019re only reinforcing their asshole status by taking it out on you. Can you move in with your mother or brother full time?", "NTA\nfor the record, being autistic isn't wrong. And the neurotypical way isn't the \"right\" or only way.", "NTA. And i suggest you make arrangements to live with your mother because these people are incredibly strange.", "If they don\u2019t want you talking about their behavior to others it is because they know it would make them look bad. \n\nIt\u2019s as simple as that. They should treat you better and then they would have nothing to worry about.", "NTA. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019m not autistic and I have trouble with social cues. I think it came from growing up with a manipulative and abusive mother (my dad was killed by a drunk driver when I was 15. He was in the process of trying to get custody of me). Now, I\u2019m not saying you are or aren\u2019t autistic. I don\u2019t know. What I am trying to say is that you\u2019re getting screwed up, mixed and convoluted messages from your dad and stepmom. Add the pandemic and the ways it messed up life, especially for young people like you. So no wonder you\u2019re feeling like you don\u2019t get social cues!\n\nIt took me a long time to realize what went on in my house growing up wasn\u2019t normal and to learn better habits. My mother gave me the \u201cvictim complex\u201d bullsh*t too. I still struggle but at least now I know it wasn\u2019t my fault. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault either. \n\nYour father is minimizing your feelings by saying your stepmom is just as hurt. He\u2019s trying to make it about her and, in doing so, he\u2019s putting all the blame on you for upsetting her rather than addressing the issues like a real father. Your feelings don\u2019t seem to matter. My guess is no matter what you do or how many times you apologize it will never be enough. \n\nI think you are right to talk to your mom and brother. I hope they can help you. Is it possible to move in with them? I think you would also be right to seek out a guidance counselor at school or the trusted parents of a friend. Maybe they can give you suggestions, comfort or support. \n\nI hope this answer helps. Best wishes!!", "NTA. You are allowed to talk to other family for support. And \"your step mom is just as hurt as you are\" is no excuse because your step mom is an adult charged with the responsibility of you and looking to your well-being (just as your dad is). They are not being responsible parental figures by expecting you to take care of their feelings. \n\nAnd if your step mother realizes that you don't understand social cues, it is up to her to help you and to be more direct, not get angry about it. They are both doing you wrong.", "NTA, they are treating you very badly and are angry at you that they've been exposed. Ask your mum if she can go to court to change the custody agreement. I would also consider just not going to your dads. Not like they can force you at your age especially with how you are treated.", "NTA - you have to speak about your problems, if what you are telling them is not true then that makes you an asshole but speaking your truth does not. Your father is trying to gaslight you by saying it upsets your stepmom. Keep yourself to yourself as much as possible when at your dads and work hard to make sure your adult life is will be fulfilling", "NTA at all here. If possible, try to find a way to live with your mother and brother full time. Your dad genuinely seems to be harming your self-image (dismissing your emotions by telling you that you have a victim complex, and deflecting & blaming you whenever you bring up the ways you feel hurt). The environment he (and potentially your step-mom) have created where you are unable to advocate for your own needs and your own emotions without second-guessing their validity is detrimental to your wellbeing.", "\"don\u2019t feel a need to greet people unless I want to engage in a conversation.\"\n\nOkay, well - welcome to society.  You complain about not being able to read social cues.  You've self-diagnosed as autistic.  Congratulations!  You apparently no longer have to engage in the rest of society.  \n\nWould it kill you to say hello when someone comes into the room?  You've identified what the trouble is.  You're not autistic enough to not understand what the simple solution could be.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
