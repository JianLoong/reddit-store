While shocking and tragic, the initial stage of debilitating grief will pass after a month or two and where will you be once that happens? \n\nI am not at all trying to minimize the importance of the loss. My family has sadly experienced something similar and I understand how terrible what your family is going through is.\n\nThe dream educational opportunity will allow you to be more helpful to your family in the long term. Your family will eventually understand this, especially if it turns out you don't quickly receive any comparable offers from east coast schools. \n\nJust do your best to do as much as you can while you're home. If as the oldest you're looked at to lead, then lead. Come up with a plan to do what must be done and delegate the things that must be done locally to the people best able to handle them in your absence. You can do many things remotely and keep in close contact with your family by phone or FaceTime.

You cannot bring your uncle back, and I am sure he would not want you to give up a chance of you fulfilling your dreams and goals of becoming a doctor.
