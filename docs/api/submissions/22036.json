My family has sadly experienced something similar and I understand how terrible what your family is going through is.\n\nThe dream educational opportunity will allow you to be more helpful to your family in the long term. Your family will eventually understand this, especially if it turns out you don't quickly receive any comparable offers from east coast schools. \n\nJust do your best to do as much as you can while you're home. If as the oldest you're looked at to lead, then lead. Come up with a plan to do what must be done and delegate the things that must be done locally to the people best able to handle them in your absence.

Be with them now, comfort them as much as you can, but please don\u2019t sacrifice your dreams and your future over a situation where you can\u2019t really change anything. i actually am in the same boat, i just lost my great grandmother a week and a half ago, and i won\u2019t be able to go to the funeral because my son has an appointment with an asthma specialist he\u2019s been waiting for since april.. an unfortunate part of loss is that life still goes on and sometimes you just have to keep going on too.", "Dude, what?

With my parents, we talked about different scenarios and if I would want to come back (I'd probably miss the funeral as I'd have to wait until the ship docked) or if they should even let me know so that my time wouldn't be shadowed by that. Ultimately, we decided that I probably wouldn't want to come home early, but that I would prefer to know at least.\n\nIn the end, my grandma lived 10 more years!! Unfortunately, this conversation did come in handy when my cousin died suddenly just a couple years later in an accident when I was in an intensive course at uni, on the other side of the country. I was so glad I'd talked about this kind of thing beforehand, because it made it so I didn't really have to choose. I ended up attending over Skype (this was 2012, so I darkly joke that I've been attending funerals over zoom since long before it was \"cool\"), and didn't even have to miss class because of the time zones. \n\nI get that it's really hard, even if I don't entirely understand the familial pressure.

You can't control when your courses begin, you can't control which school accepts you. This is something you have to do and your entire family will understand.\n\nStay in touch with them while you're gone. Check in with your mom often.
