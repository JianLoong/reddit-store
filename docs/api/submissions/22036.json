Medical school takes priority. \n\nFWIW, My mother died August 18th and the first week of September I was at college for my junior year. It was stressful and I was sad, but sometimes you just have to step up and get things done.\n\nMy condolences to you and your family on your loss.\n\nNTA", "NTA as so many people here have explained better than I could. So I will say \u201cCongratulations!\u201d \ud83c\udf89", "Apologies, I meant it as in an unexpected passing. He passed at the age of 48.", "A few years ago I had an aunt die. It was tough for the entire family. Once it was all said and done, all the family members kinda went their own way for a few weeks. A couple went on vacation while some went back to work. \n\nHonestly going to your school and building your life is the best thing you could possibly do. It's also August, so a few weeks in between, it's not like you're leaving out the day after the funeral. \n\nAnd something in me says your uncle would want the same thing for you.", "I\u2019m south Asian and i get it! It\u2019s hard leaving family when something bad happens. But they wants what\u2019s best for us and they will not hold us back", "I don\u2019t think you would be the asshole, but would you be able to defer enrollment for a year and would you be okay with that if possible?", "NTA at all. Sad about your uncle, but this is an opportunity.\n\nI'm moving up to the PNW at the end of the month as well! Don't let me move alone!", "NTA\n\nGiving up your future won't do anything to bring your uncle back, OP.", "Your uncle died. Your future didn\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA. Congratulations!", "I hope you go on to graduate in his honor!", "NTA- I\u2019m from Seattle- if you\u2019re talking about UW then don\u2019t let the opportunity go by! It\u2019s an amazing university and the social connections you\u2019ll make will be well worth it. Seattle is a medical hub and an amazing place to start your career. Don\u2019t be an AH to yourself, you\u2019ve been working towards this goal and it\u2019s finally happening. You\u2019ve earned it. May your uncle rest in peace.", "So sorry for yours and your families loss, but I am sure that your uncle would not have wanted you to risk your own future because his was cut short. Good luck with everything, NTA", "YWNBTA- the timing isn\u2019t great but that can\u2019t be helped. It might be tough without you but that education will be as important to them as it is to you. It\u2019s sad that his life ended but you need to live yours.", "NTA\n\n\nWhile I understand that some people process grief differently than others, waiting 'only' a month instead of 2 months after his passing to get on with your education and your dreams seems perfectly reasonable in this instance.  Honestly, the decision about your further education was known before your uncle died, and I see no reason why you shouldn't carry on with it.  Heck, for all you know, this would have been what your uncle wanted you to do, rather than putting your life on hold.\n\nGo to school, and honor his memory by being a great doctor.", "You would definitely be NTA for this decision. \n\nI am assuming off your phrasing that your family will also think of you  \" not being there for the family \" if you go.  I would advise you to counter this with while you understand the current feelings of the family you are focusing on the future financial well-being of the family. Make it about them and the benefits everyone will receive by you taking this opportunity, and it may be a bit easier on everyone . Sorry for your loss, i hope your family can grieve healthily.", "NTA. Pay your respects when you get back though. Your uncle would want you to pursue your dreams.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure if your uncle was alive, he\u2019d tell you to go chase your dreams.", "I read it the same and it hit home. Last week my grandma had a heart attack and is now in palliative care. Today I\u2019m on a flight to the other side of the world on a long planned holiday. I live about 7hrs drive away from my parents and grandparents so I didn\u2019t know if I should cancel and go home instead. Both my mum and grandma said life is for the living when I spoke to them on the phone. Still feel a bit guilty but my family support and understand. As I\u2019m sure the OP\u2019s family will", "*Emotional Damage!!*"]}
