There was a rehearsal dinner Friday night and the wedding ceremony/ reception Saturday night. \n\nWe have three young kids and so we never get to spend time together.  I had arranged for family to watch all the kids so we could have 2 nights of sleep and, just, a nice break. I was really looking forward to it.\n\nMy wife had started a new job a few months earlier and was really stressed out about it. She had been feeling like there was no time to get anything done.\n\nFriday rolls along and she's stressed out. We're supposed to drop the kids off with my parents and drive up right when she gets off of work. I asked if it would be less stressful for her if I got a ride with a friend so she could skip the rehearsal dinner and not be in a rush. That way she could just drop the kids off and drive up whenever she wanted later that night. (I had to pick up a tux so I had to be there.) She seemed relieved at the offer and accepted it, so I got a ride with a friend. \n\nFriday night she ends up staying for dinner at my parents' place and helping put our littlest to bed there and tells me it's too late for her to drive up that night.\n\nSaturday around noon I get a panicked call angry with me because she didn't know what time the wedding was. (The ceremony was at 4pm.) On one hand, I get the panic, but on the other, I thought she'd already be there, or at least leave after breakfast, etc.\n\nMy wife had arranged for one of her friends to come over and watch our dog while we were gone. On Saturday the friend came over. It was the anniversary of her divorce. During the course of the day I get text messages about how hard it is to leave for the wedding culminating in hearing that she couldn't leave her friend alone. She ends up missing the ceremony and showed up about an hour into the reception. \n\nI was happy to see her and reassure her that it's okay in the moment. A few days later I told her I realized I was pretty angry that she missed so much of it. For one, because I was looking forward to a few nights alone with her away from the kids. For two because it was my best friend's wedding. \n\nShe's upset both because I reassured her on the day that it was okay, and also because she doesn't think she did anything wrong, but rather adhered to her moral code to be there for her friend. I don't think I ever even got an apology. Mostly I hear how unreasonable it is for me to be angry about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672403008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyzaj1/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_come_to_my_best/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knew this was important to you, but put her priorities first repeatedly. She honestly should have come up Friday night--there was no reason for her not to, right? She just stayed late, then used the excuse that it was late.\n\nOf course you didn't make an issue of it during the reception; you were happy she was there and wanted to enjoy the time.\n\nIt's something to discuss. She put your feelings last, and that's not acceptable in a partnership.", "NTA.  It sounds to me like she did  not want to attend the wedding for some reason. Is there something between her and these friends who were getting married?", "NTA. Your wife put everyone before you and your need for quality time alone with your partner. \nI\u2019m someone that feels once kids enter the chat, they come first. They just do. But I\u2019d be a bit hurt at this TBH. The kids were with family and the dog was being cared for. Needing to travel separately to accommodate schedules, sure. But why not follow the \u201cI\u2019ll drop the kids and head up\u201d plan? \n\nAnd the friend thing, it\u2019s the anniversary of a divorce. Yeah, come on. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think she wanted to attend this wedding and found any excuse not to go.", "NTA, if she didn't want to come to the wedding \u2013 which it seems like she didn't \u2013 she should have told you. There's no way 'friend's divorce anniversary' trumps 'spouse's best friend's wedding that you said you'd be at.' Clearly she didn't make an effort to be there.\n\nI wouldn't be *too* upset because it seems like she's stressed out and struggling a bit, but you're right to be annoyed and she definitely did not adhere to basic social norms. I think the friend was just a convenient excuse to not go, which would have been fine if she'd just said so.", "NTA, it was not a high bar for your wife, but she needs help managing her life atm, don't miss that", "NTA. Your wife didn\u2019t come through because she wasn\u2019t on the same page as you for whatever reason.

I\u2019m sure your parents are more than capable of watching the kids for a night or two, so there really wasn\u2019t a need for her to stay. \n\nNext, she\u2019s the one who arranged for her friend to dogsit. What a coincidence that it\u2019s the anniversary of her friend\u2019s divorce. Her friend had known it was the anniversary and still said yes to dogsitting. But honestly it makes me wonder if she had known about the anniversary beforehand and picked that friend so she\u2019d have an excuse to not go. \n\nI could be wrong, but those are the vibes I\u2019m getting.", "NTA. I understand her wanting to comfort a friend. But I don't understand her putting her friends needs in front of yours. You two have (from what you say) little alone time.

You were disappointed, she should understand that.", "Time for a sit down. First tell her when you\u2019re disappointed. And she deprioritized you.

She's not a mind reader, and you said it was fine. So she went with that. Now, had you told her immediately how hurt you'd be and had she chose the friend instead, you'd be way more in the right. Hurt feelings are never fair. If you manage it, tell her how much you wanted some time alone, try to get a weekend away the two of you together. Good luck and happy New year!", "Still deciding on  my my judgement but\n\n\"Friday rolls along and she's stressed out.

I asked if it would be less stressful for her if I got a ride with a friend so she could skip the rehearsal dinner and not be in a rush.

Any reason YOU could not drop off YOUR kids at YOUR parents to save her having to rush around?\n\n\"She seemed relieved at the offer and accepted it, so I got a ride with a friend.\"  I bet she was extremely relieved at the offer as it meant she would have time to breathe - you know after a stressful day at a new job, packing up kids, transporting them etc with presumably little or no help from their father.  \n\"Saturday around noon I get a panicked call angry with me because she didn't know what time the wedding was.\" So you didn't ring her Saturday morning to see how she was, if she had got some sleep, felt less stressed?\n\n\" A few days later I told her I realized I was pretty angry that she missed so much of it. For one, because I was looking forward to a few nights alone with her away from the kids.\"  So plan a few days away with her just for the two of you - without one night being a dinner with lots of people, the next day being a wedding with lots of friends - you know, something planned for the two of you, not an incidental booty call while attending someone else's event.", "NAH\n\nYou are absolutely entitled to feel angry about it.  Your feelings are your own, after all.  And your wife is being completely unreasonable to insist you not feel angry about it.\n\nHowever, if your wife has always put close friends above social engagements, she was not wrong in sticking to her own moral code.   \n\nAnd you should absolutely have told her you felt angry about it, up front, rather than lie and say it's OK.  \n\nThat's why I'm saying NAH.  Both of you did things that upset the other and wronged the other.  No, you will never get an apology, but you are not wrong for feeling angry.  Nor is she wrong for being supportive of her best friend over being late for a wedding.\n\nHowever, if you are **holding onto** that anger, I advise you get therapy, because that anger will, over time, destroy your marriage.", "Very very light ESH \n\nI think you both could have been more honest with each other and communicated better. \n\nYour wife- she should have told you she was too stressed to go to the wedding\u2026it appears she had been making excuses since dropping the kids off. She should have just told you upfront that she wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. Also, a friends divorce anniversary doesn\u2019t trump an important weekend for your husband. Again I think she was just making excuses because she was too stressed to deal with it. \n\nYou- you should have mentioned you were angry when she first got there. Nothing is worse than someone telling you days later, especially if you reassured her you were fine. Retroactive anger is the worst! \n\nIt was very nice of you to plan a weekend away and I\u2019m sure it was very disappointing that it didn\u2019t go as planned. Next time, tell your wife how you are feeling in the moment.", "NAH. You\u2019re entitled to your emotions. No one gets to tell you you \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d feel something. If there\u2019s any assholeyness here it\u2019s that, but even that is just her feeling misled by the change between \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m angry\u201d. I\u2019d bet money that parts upsetting her more than the actual frustration you\u2019re expressing. \n\nI think this was just a stressful situation where maybe you didn\u2019t express as clearly as you could have how important this was, and she didn\u2019t listen to the parts you were expressing. Not an asshole situation, perhaps just a slight breakdown on communication.\n\nHonestly, weddings are stressful even as a guest because there are other peoples timelines to work off of, so it may just not have been a great idea to pin your stress relief on a wedding trip. Maybe y\u2019all should plan something where there isn\u2019t a schedule or itinerary that needs to be followed. May be much more enjoyable, and be clear that it\u2019s all about you two having a good time", "NAH. You each spent the weekend supporting the people you love. It's just that you got to have fun (albeit while missing your wife), while she spent it taking care of others. \n\nAre you really angry at her choice? Or are you disappointed that you didn't get the weekend with her you were anticipating? \n\nIs she happy with her choice? Or did she feel she had no other option but to stay with her friend?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"because I reassured her on the day that it was okay\" .. **You told her it was ok.** So stop harassing her., Why would she apologize?", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. And this isn\u2019t only about you. Your wife snubbed her hosts. First, she missed the rehearsal dinner. If it was held at a restaurant, her hosts probably paid for her dinner in advance. I\u2019m sorry about her friend, but your wife had a social obligation and an obligation to you to attend the wedding itself. \n\nBut I feel for your wife. It sounds like she\u2019s under enormous pressure. I\u2019m not sure if she was unable to tell her friend she had to go or if her friend was a convenient excuse to stay home a little longer. But not going to the wedding sounds like a byproduct of her anxiety. Is there anything that can be done to make your day-to-day living easier? Can you hire a cleaning service, or a dog walker? Is there a reliable teenager your neighborhood who can babysit for a few hours while you go to dinner? Or maybe you could hire a babysitter come in so the two of you can run errands and have lunch. Finding ways to remove some of the tasks on her list may remove some of her stress.\n\nLittle children bring joy, but they also create stress because they are so needy. But they will grow out of this stage. Keep reminding yourself of that. One day, sooner than you can possibly imagine, the two of you will be able to take weekend trips again.", "YTA. It was only a couple of hours that she missed of the wedding. She was being a good friend who was having a rough time, whereas your friend was having the happiest time.\n\nAlso can't comprehend how people complicate their lives to much. Two kids and a dog? That's a lot of logistics making it all more time consuming. So you're both on that same boat of juggling too many plates at once.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now it's about the wife's disregard for her husband. Forget bailing on the wedding weekend with him, now he's not even allowed to be upset with her that she bailed.

Both people here had legitimate concerns.\n\nI just hope OP gets therapy if he's holding into the anger.", "I disagree with this because it's very reasonable and mature to tell your spouse that something bothered/hurt you more than you thought it would. I think the bigger issue is the wife refusing to engage with her husband after he told her that. Telling your partner their feelings are invalid is rarely the good path to go. Emotions do not follow any code of law or honor, you are allowed to say youre ok with something then later realize youre not. It'd be so much easier if the wife went \"I'm sorry this happened, let me make it up to you, do you want to plan another weekend get away just the 2 of us?\" Or something like that.", "OP said in a comment that they only have one car, and the person picking him up had to get him before the kids were out of school so that\u2019s why she had to drop them off", "I feel that OP- YTA.", "Eh her husband should be above close friends.
