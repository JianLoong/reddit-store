There was a rehearsal dinner Friday night and the wedding ceremony/ reception Saturday night. \n\nWe have three young kids and so we never get to spend time together.  I had arranged for family to watch all the kids so we could have 2 nights of sleep and, just, a nice break. I was really looking forward to it.\n\nMy wife had started a new job a few months earlier and was really stressed out about it. She had been feeling like there was no time to get anything done.\n\nFriday rolls along and she's stressed out. We're supposed to drop the kids off with my parents and drive up right when she gets off of work. I asked if it would be less stressful for her if I got a ride with a friend so she could skip the rehearsal dinner and not be in a rush. That way she could just drop the kids off and drive up whenever she wanted later that night. (I had to pick up a tux so I had to be there.) She seemed relieved at the offer and accepted it, so I got a ride with a friend. \n\nFriday night she ends up staying for dinner at my parents' place and helping put our littlest to bed there and tells me it's too late for her to drive up that night.\n\nSaturday around noon I get a panicked call angry with me because she didn't know what time the wedding was. (The ceremony was at 4pm.) On one hand, I get the panic, but on the other, I thought she'd already be there, or at least leave after breakfast, etc.\n\nMy wife had arranged for one of her friends to come over and watch our dog while we were gone. On Saturday the friend came over. It was the anniversary of her divorce. During the course of the day I get text messages about how hard it is to leave for the wedding culminating in hearing that she couldn't leave her friend alone. She ends up missing the ceremony and showed up about an hour into the reception. \n\nI was happy to see her and reassure her that it's okay in the moment. A few days later I told her I realized I was pretty angry that she missed so much of it. For one, because I was looking forward to a few nights alone with her away from the kids. For two because it was my best friend's wedding. \n\nShe's upset both because I reassured her on the day that it was okay, and also because she doesn't think she did anything wrong, but rather adhered to her moral code to be there for her friend. I don't think I ever even got an apology. Mostly I hear how unreasonable it is for me to be angry about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672403008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyzaj1/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_come_to_my_best/", "score": 1063, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both of you did things that upset the other and wronged the other.  No, you will never get an apology, but you are not wrong for feeling angry.

She should have just told you upfront that she wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. Also, a friends divorce anniversary doesn\u2019t trump an important weekend for your husband. Again I think she was just making excuses because she was too stressed to deal with it. \n\nYou- you should have mentioned you were angry when she first got there. Nothing is worse than someone telling you days later, especially if you reassured her you were fine. Retroactive anger is the worst! \n\nIt was very nice of you to plan a weekend away and I\u2019m sure it was very disappointing that it didn\u2019t go as planned.

I\u2019d bet money that parts upsetting her more than the actual frustration you\u2019re expressing. \n\nI think this was just a stressful situation where maybe you didn\u2019t express as clearly as you could have how important this was, and she didn\u2019t listen to the parts you were expressing. Not an asshole situation, perhaps just a slight breakdown on communication.\n\nHonestly, weddings are stressful even as a guest because there are other peoples timelines to work off of, so it may just not have been a great idea to pin your stress relief on a wedding trip.

Your feelings are valid. And this isn\u2019t only about you. Your wife snubbed her hosts. First, she missed the rehearsal dinner. If it was held at a restaurant, her hosts probably paid for her dinner in advance. I\u2019m sorry about her friend, but your wife had a social obligation and an obligation to you to attend the wedding itself. \n\nBut I feel for your wife. It sounds like she\u2019s under enormous pressure. I\u2019m not sure if she was unable to tell her friend she had to go or if her friend was a convenient excuse to stay home a little longer. But not going to the wedding sounds like a byproduct of her anxiety. Is there anything that can be done to make your day-to-day living easier? Can you hire a cleaning service, or a dog walker? Is there a reliable teenager your neighborhood who can babysit for a few hours while you go to dinner? Or maybe you could hire a babysitter come in so the two of you can run errands and have lunch. Finding ways to remove some of the tasks on her list may remove some of her stress.\n\nLittle children bring joy, but they also create stress because they are so needy. But they will grow out of this stage. Keep reminding yourself of that. One day, sooner than you can possibly imagine, the two of you will be able to take weekend trips again.", "YTA. It was only a couple of hours that she missed of the wedding. She was being a good friend who was having a rough time, whereas your friend was having the happiest time.\n\nAlso can't comprehend how people complicate their lives to much. Two kids and a dog?

I think the bigger issue is the wife refusing to engage with her husband after he told her that. Telling your partner their feelings are invalid is rarely the good path to go. Emotions do not follow any code of law or honor, you are allowed to say youre ok with something then later realize youre not.

If someone is extremely stressed out and feels overwhelmed all the time it could be a sign of mental problems like burnout. Right before I had mine, I made the weirdest decisions because I couldn\u2019t think straight anymore, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it. I also had problems prioritising and dealing with emotions. I really wasn\u2019t functioning properly anymore and was totally blind to it. I was walking around like a chicken without a head for months until I crashed.\n\nAnd I wonder, did you communicate to your wife that this wedding trip was very important to you and that you were really looking forward to it? It doesn\u2019t seem like you and your wife were on the same page. The way your wife acted feels like it was just another task on her (never ending) to do list.\n\nI also think it\u2019s a bit weird that you only assumed your wife would leave after breakfast and be there around noon. Why don\u2019t you two communicate about these things? I think that\u2019s a very normal thing to do in a relationship. You two talked the night before, so why didn\u2019t you talk about the time she was going to be there the next day? Why didn\u2019t your wife know about the time of the wedding ceremony? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong for expressing your disappointment/anger a few days later, but I wonder why you didn\u2019t communicate that you wanted her to be there for you when she texted you about the friend. Something like, I\u2019m sorry for your friend, but it\u2019s important for me, your husband, to have you at my best friends wedding (*). (I also think this friend is a bit weird and selfish, because she knew she was dog sitting that day and OP wasn\u2019t available for moral support because of the wedding. If her divorce anniversary is a difficult day for her, she should\u2019ve said no to the dog sitting.)\n\nFor now I cannot make a judgment. Your wife\u2019s behaviour seems off, but there could be a serious reason behind it. And I think there\u2019s a big lack in communication. I only read about your feelings and thoughts and assumptions, but I don\u2019t know what was actually communicated upfront. I also don\u2019t know about the relationship between your wife and your best friend, e.g. do you normally visit him as a couple?\n\n(*) My partner\u2019s friends aren\u2019t my friends and vice versa. When there\u2019s an event, like a birthday, we don\u2019t always go together (but I did attend all weddings he was invited to). The thing is, we always communicate about it and I will always ask if he wants me to be there. If it\u2019s important for him, I will go. If it\u2019s not and he doesn\u2019t care (and his friends don\u2019t care), I have some extra me time.", "NAH. Your disappointment is understandable, but it seems your wife is severely overextended and is currently reacting to others' needs rather than her own needs or plans.\n\n>My wife had started a new job a few months earlier and was really stressed out about it.

You were perfectly right to be excited to spend some quality time with your wife and being disappointed that she didn\u2019t commit they way you thought you had agreed and didn\u2019t communicate properly when things changed. \n\nAs a fellow overworked women, I feel I understand where your wife was coming from. She\u2019s stressed and tired from putting other\u2019s needs ahead of her own. \n\nFor example: she went from work to pick the kids up on her own (you were originally going to help) and then drop them off (possibly at various family houses). The way it sounds was she was planning on heading up straight after but didn\u2019t. Why? I wonder if she really wanted to stay for supper at the in-laws or did she feel obligated? Could she really say no to her youngest when they asked her to put them to bed or did she feel mommy guilt? Did she really want to stay with her distraught friend or did she feel that she couldn\u2019t just leave them when they were so upset without feeling like a failure? And, if I am guessing, with you in the wedding party, how much time would you be spending with her that weekend and how much would she be in her own or having to make small talk and draining her emotional bucket even further? Culminating in having to then prioritize your needs (being at a wedding she doesn\u2019t sound to enthusiastic about) over hers. \n\nGive your wife a break.
