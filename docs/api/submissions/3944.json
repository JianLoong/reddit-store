That's a LOT of work. He could have asked people to bring side dishes, or could have bought food, but no. He could have asked people to help him in the kitchen, as many families do, but he didn't do that either . . . he let people relax and enjoy themselves for hours while he did all the cooking. \n\n>My dad had asked if both me and my sister could serve up dinner, my sister got up and started walking towards the kitchen. my dad said he had asked a question to which I replied I know, but you and mom have hosted this dinner you should be the ones serving it. \n\nWow. Just . . . wow. Rude much? You don't give your age, but I kind of have to hope that you're . . . nope, I can't think of an age when it wouldn't be rude to speak to your parents that way. Even as a teenager, if my parents asked me politely to serve at a holiday dinner, the response was either, \"Sure!\" or (because I am literally chronically ill and disabled), \"I'm really sorry, I'm in a lot of pain and I'm not sure I can carry things.\" I cannot IMAGINE looking my mother in the eye after she had prepared an entire holiday meal, if she asked nicely for some assistance, and saying, \"Uh, I'm not the host. You or dad should be doing this.\" Yikes.\n\nYou DO know that asking someone politely for some help serving out the food - including guests - is totally normal and socially acceptable, right? Hell, I can't think of a single one of my mum's friends who hasn't VOLUNTEERED at a dinner party to get up and carry something from the kitchen into the dining room.\n\n>The whole dinner was silent, any conversation made quickly went quiet.\n\nWell yes. Because after putting out a huge, lovely effort to make a holiday meal for all of you, your dad asked nicely for a bit of help serving so he could finally sit down, and you were rude AF. That does tend to put a damper on the conversation.\n\n>\r  \nHe pulled me aside and sarcastically thanked me for ruining the Christmas meal and that I should of just served it. i told him no, if YOU HOST A MEAL YOU SERVE IT,\n\n\"Should have\". And wow, you just have no self-awareness at all, do you? Like, words just come out of your mouth and you have NO IDEA how rude they sound. I hope that your Christmas gift was a book on manners, because you clearly have none. YTA, and an appalling guest.", "OP, in this case you are not just a \"guest\" you are also a family member. You admit that your dad cooked by himself while you all enjoyed games and even opening presents. Your dad wanted to enjoy some of the time with his guests, and simply asked you to help serve. In this case refusing was in fact rude. If you also left without helping to clean up, or at least offering to do so, that's also rude. Your dad was trying to enjoy the dinner as well, and your attitude likley did ruin it for him. He did all that work for his own child to be ungrateful and unhelpful. So yes, in this case, YTA and you do owe him an apology.", "YTA. You are a member of the family who arrived before he started cooking. You then did many things but didn't help him in the kitchen. Serving the food would have been a nice way to say thank you for him cooking it.\n\nYour sister rolled her eyes because you were being selfish.", "YTA\n\nIf you are concerned about etiquette, you missed the mark.\n\nIf the host asks for assistance, you provide it. You displayed terribly poor manners by embarrassing them in front of everyone. You behaved like a child who thinks only in terms of \"fairness and not my turn to do the chore\".\n\nYour father worked hard, it was the least you could do.", "YTA. From the info given, your dad prepared everything himself. Perhaps he was a bit tired after all that?", "YTA after working all morning in the kitchen your dad asks the ONE FAVOR of allowing him to sit down, relax, and have someone else plate the dishes and carry them around\u2026.but you couldn\u2019t because in your mind the hosts must properly do it?  This is all family, your family, and you\u2019re an asshole", "YTA. You are so totally the asshole. We all pitch in at family dinners.", "Info. What do you mean by serve? Like do you have to just bring the food to the table or did they want you to plate each persons food individually?", "YTA, its family dinner, everyone helps", "Yta, what a hill to die on", "YTA. A lazy one, without a doubt. Who made up the hard fast rule that if you host a family meal you must serve that meal too. Just because you follow that imaginary rule in your house, doesn't mean others have to follow it in their home. Shame on you.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t like that your brother wasn\u2019t also asked to help out. However, this is your dad, he cooked all morning.  Expect as they get older, they will do less. When with family we help bring food out, clean  up , etc.  Also when with friends we ask if there is something we can do to help or just help", "YTA. You couldn't be bothered to help? He's your dad.", "I've been to dinners where you go buffet style through the kitchen counter, island and plop everything on your plate. Been to lots where food is put on the table and you take a scoop, pass the plate on bowl. I've plated food for hundreds of people but that is working in a restaurant. \n\nI'd say many hands make light work. 6 plates between 2 people doesn't sound incredibly burdensome and perhaps your dad needed a break after cooking for 3 hours. More if you take into account the prep work. Running around getting things. I know with my parents they always did distinct duties at family dinner but as my dad got on, I'd do it. I'd carve the meat, plate the main dishes, even cook. Family doesn't really follow the norms of host protocol, or at least mine doesn't.", "YTA.  He spent all morning cooking so the least you could do was to help out and serve it.", "Seriously? Definitely YTA.\n\nYou were at a family dinner, not a \"family restaurant\". Get off your backside and help your Dad since he spent the time and effort preparing it.\n\nDon't be surprised if you're not invited next year.", "You know, maybe your father was tired. Have you thought of that? Maybe he needed help. Maybe he would have enjoyed resting his feet for a minute and relaxing and enjoying dinner with his guests after spending HOURS cooking it. For you all. Your reaction was incredibly selfish. YTA", "YTA\n\nDid you make your own plate or let your sister do all the work \u2014even plating your dinner?", "YTA and your reasoning is completely ridiculous.\n\nUnless you are eating at a catered affair with servants, it is entirely normal for guests to help with serving and clearing after the meal. Most \\*normal\\* guests offer and ask how they can help.\n\nIt is doubly outrageous that you are taking this position at a family dinner where your father has been cooking all day. I have never been to a dinner with my family in which the parents were expected to act like servants as most functional family members pitch in as standard operating procedure.\n\nDid you help set the table? \n\nAnd even if your father likes to cook, it doesn't mean that it isn't hard tiring work. Many people split the food chores - someone cooks (either the same person because they like to cook or they alternate) and whoever doesn't cook the cleans up the kitchen.", "YTA, But OP why did you include that part about going to the bathroom, and being the last person to use the bathroom? What does that have to do with hosting versus serving?", "YTA. So instead of being caring, considerate and helpful; you behaved like a selfish child. What he asked wasn't difficult, not physically taxing nor mentally above your paygrade. It was literally an easy ask, and the right thing to do would be to just do it and discuss the hosting etiquette later on. Instead you made a childish scene at a holiday gathering and refuse to take ownership of your bad behavior. I suspect you have a long history of selfish reactions.", "YTA.  You seem to have a slightly weird idea about defining roles at what should be a fun informal gathering.  It's like you think the role of Host comes with a job description but only you know what the duties are.  That's not how it works in normal families (including yours it seems since everyone was angry with you).  Could you not have just served the food that your dad worked so hard on?  It seems a small price to pay to show your appreciation...I assume you did appreciate it?", "YTA This a family dinner. You can do your part and help out. Everyone should help out. Expecting your parent to cook all day and then serve you is uncalled for.\n\nEdit: why did you ask if you refuse to listen to what anyone says?", "YTA. Completely and utterly. What a completely rude and disrespectful thing to do.", "Ya, YTA I'm 45 and still help out with family meals when asked. Usually before being asked actually. Offering to help is part of being a guest in someone else's home. Not to mention your Dad had been cooking all day and was probably exhausted.", "Man, that's the hill you're gonna die on!?  You didn't mention your gender, so if it was \"women serve,\" that'd be frustrating, although your dad cooked the whole meal, so hopefully there's nothing like that going on there.\n\nI agree that I'd kind of expect the host to take that on, but spending five minutes dishing up the meal doesn't seem like a huge imposition, especially at a family meal.\n\nAlas, it kind of sounds like YTA.  I can't believe that the whole family got that exercised over it, though -- why didn't your brother or his wife hop up to help out?  This really doesn't sound like a big deal.", "YTA. Your dad cooked all day while everyone else had fun and you're offended because he asked you to put the food on the table?", "YTA\nFor the \"logic\" of your stance\n\nYour parents worked their As off preparing.   You could have doubled down against the sexism of only you and your sister being asked to serve. Or  against the idea that adults cant plate their own food and escaped such judgment .\n But your hill is that they should have continued doing all the work?  \nNah.", "YTA. Gosh, you would have broken your wrist carrying the immense number of heavy dishes to serve seven people. I hope you can recover from your father's totally disrespectful attitude that he would request his child's assistance in serving dinner.\n\nI sincerely wonder if you will be invited next year. Maybe, by then, you will have lost your \"superior\" attitude and apologize to all of the other guests for your obnoxious behavior.", "YTA. My brother suggested we do dinner buffet style so we didn't even have to bring things to the table this year, and I wash the dishes (china and pots/pans) every year because my mother cooks the meal and should be able to relax after.", "YTA - your dad asked for help doing something simple. He did the hard part. If you're going to behave like this, don't go to family gatherings.", "Op what do you lose by doing what was asked? \n\nI know you have your rule about the hosts also serve the food. \n\nI also want to know if you went over to catch-up, and you\u2019re asked to get the milk from the fridge, is that also an issue?\n\nYTA. These are your parents. Not randoms or friends. You\u2019ve stated that your dad doesn\u2019t like anyone helping him yet he asked for your help, surely that would\u2019ve clued you in? \n\nYou\u2019re likely to not get invited again. I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to spend Christmas with you.\n\n(My sister done this in Christmas 2020 with her then 1m, she didn\u2019t lift a finger and acted like a rude entitled guest all day. Last year she wasn\u2019t there, and we had a great time, this year should be the same).", "YTA, your dad just spent literal hours cooking while you all relaxed and enjoyed the holidays. You can shuffle around food and plates for a few minutes to make his job a little easier.", "YTA\n\nHow does it feel arguing with everyone in the replies?", "Wow you suck. YTA.", "YTA and don't be surprised if your rude a$$ isn't invited to any more family meals.", "Info: because I don\u2019t fully understand this.  Is \u201cserving\u201d dinner a thing?  In my family, we just put the food on the table or on an island and we all serve ourselves buffet style.  Do some families literally have people going around putting food on people\u2019s plates?  Is this a cultural thing?  Any insight would be helpful.", "Was your brother also told to serve?", "I really don\u2019t understand why you refused. What an odd hill to die on. Even if I\u2019m a guest at a friend\u2019s house, I\u2019m offering to help. \n\nIs this some kind of feminist thing for you? Like\u2026he didn\u2019t ask your brother just you and your sister and that pissed you off?\n\nWhat other things will you refuse to do if asked just because you\u2019re not hosting? Like\u2026will you help clear the table? Take out trash?", "Why were only you and your sister asked to serve if your brother was there as well?", "ESH except for your dad and your sister.
