I don\u2019t want to do it every week nor do I want a stranger randomly coming into my h8me.\n\nBut the big reason I declined was she let it slip that the rent was actually less, and because she had paid a broker to find the apartment, she was asking $100 a month more than what half of the rent would have been. Not my problem, so the next day I very nicely told her that I had decided that I was going to wait a bit and would not be taking the apartment with her. But really?

I am sorry if anyone agrees to these terms, he/she will suffer greatly on this.", "NTA - he was asked to sign because his daughter didn\u2019t have enough rental history, which has nothing to do with you. His request for you to pay $100 was ridiculous, and his response was childish thank all that is good and natural in the world that you avoided these people.", "NTA - so he wants to make money off you, and when you kindly and politely back out of their controlling and manipulatively ways - they judge your character?  \n\nYou are soooo lucky you got out of that situation.  That dad sounds like a nut job - and would definitely interfere long term.  Text back, \"Blocking you now.

Her dad probably would have stolen the money from you, so it's good you didn't throw it away like that.", "Jesus, bullet dodged. Her dad sounds like a con artist, nice little earner to get paid $100 a month for your daughter's accommodation.\n\nNTA", "Nta they are both ridiculous.", "Loony tunes", "Thanks heavens you dodged that situation. Well done! NTA", "They sound extremely toxic! Good thing you dipped out.", "NTA - you dodged a bullet.  Your parents would be PROUD of your behavior.", "NTA, obviously.

Dang, you dodged a bullet as they say.", "Absolutely NTA you made the right decision, that deal was absurd and it is not at all 'just the way it is'.

So your exfriend lied to you when she said \u2018this is just the way things are\u2019.

At least she found out relatively early and before any contracts were signed.", "I can see the dad telling the daughter, the person that he's helping and needs his help, to front him money, but OP wasn't even the issue, the roommate was", "^ this \u00d7 \ud83d\udcaf", "Exactly right.

They aren't going to get a rise out of me, I'm just going to laugh at how ridiculous they're being and it usually pisses them off more which makes me happy.", "Likely they will threaten OP with violence or lawsuit.

That\u2019s about right. I think the boomer slander stands", "I feel seen.", "But OP can go rent anywhere else, with anyone else, she doesn't need to rent with this friend. She gains absolutely nothing from having to pay an extra 100 bucks a month.", "That\u2019s the truth.", "NTA. By \u201ctest your character\u201d Dad meant \u201clet me see if you\u2019ll let me manipulate and abuse you.\u201d Bullet dodged.

She should be paying him the 100.00 dollars a month.  \n\nAs for him dissing you, he needs to look in the mirror trying to extort money from her future roommate because he doesn't want to sign for her.

It really means a lot to me. After the phone call with her, I was reeling because it felt like an out-of-body experience. \n\n**In the phone call**, I tried multiple times to calm her down. One thing I said was \"Things are this stressful now and we haven't lived together.\" To which she responded, \"That's just the way things are. It's stressful right now, but now everything is fine, why don't you get that\". The multiple questions directed toward my ability to reason and make sound judgement threw me for a loop. There were multiple times where I just wanted to say \"Do you hear yourself right now\" \n\n**For some of the comments,** I do not have any health problems. I though the death reasoning was quite bizarre. Upon further reflection and thanks to everyone's comments, it seems like they were trying to throw every reason in the book to \"test me\".\n\n**About the text,** t, I tried multiple times to calm her down. One thing I said was \"Things are this stressful now and we haven't lived together.\" To which she responded, \"That's just the way things are.

You don't know him, how would he prove he will return the money after you move out? He wouldn't. And what kind of bullshit reason is \"you might die\"? That sounds more like a threat, considering his message. What a creepy man. It's best you aren't stuck far from your family near this guy. I am reaching? Maybe. Is he giving me the ammo for it? Definitely.\n\nNTA. You'll do way better not having him or his daughter in your life.", "NTA. Email him back with only a link to this thread. Copy his daughter. Then block them both on everything.
