These people are bonkers and you dodged two massive bullets", "Nta , what he was demanding is CRAZY & who\u2019s not to say they would fk you over? You saved yourself from that craziness.

Dad had to be the guarantor because of his daughter and your supposed to pay him $100 a month in case you die?! You're lucky you found out about your exfriend and her dad before you got in any deeper. You would've been neck deep in a nightmare.", "NTA. These people have issues, especially the dad. Good for you getting out of this situation before signing a lease together.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you were being set up and used. Especially with her reaction. \n\nGood riddence to bad rubbish.", "NTA The dad was really trying to profit off of you. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like it. That was crazy, and his email underscores that he\u2019s unbalanced.", "NTA. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA lol. I'd print out that dad's message and post it up on my fridge and SM. It's hilarious.", "NTA\n\nRun far. Run fast. Stay off off that crazy train \ud83d\ude02\n\nSounds like daughter comes by her crazy naturally.", "NTA. The father saw this as an opportunity to make money and probably convinced his daughter that it\u2019s a normal business transaction. I\u2019ve never heard of someone trying this bullshit of charging someone to be a guarantor.", "NTA. OP that dad is clearly insane. you did the right thing by pulling out of it. make sure to block both of their numbers and if they show up at your new residence call the police and have them tresspassed", "You also got a very good measure of your former friend's father's character.  He's a scammer who tried to extort $100/month from his daughter's roommate.  He was unwilling to be guarantor for his DAUGHTER and her roommate.  He is a special kind of sleazy, and your former friend is a very poor excuse for a friend (and as for what she'd be like as a roommate... you really dodged a bullet there.)\n\nNTA\n\nNeither daughter nor father have any character to speak of.", "NTA. You don't need such ridiculous people in your life.", "NTA. She's the one that needed her father as a Co-signer, because she lacks rental history.
