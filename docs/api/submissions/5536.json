Throwaway account for reasons.\n\nI have been lucky to have a group of about ten friends that get together on a somewhat regular basis. As often as adults can get together when they are in their 30's anyway. We all met in college. Every year for the past ten years, we have had a Christmas celebration either before or after the holidays, depending on everyone's schedule. People take turns hosting.\n\nI recently bought a larger house, so it was suggested that I host at mine. I said I didn't think that would be a good idea and have been getting flack for it, and a few people have told me I'm being an asshole. \n\nMy reason is my dog. I have a large younger dog who cannot stand kids. About half the friend group have had kids in the past few years and there are 6 kids under the age of five in the group. I do not see that going well at all. \n\nA couple people have suggested that I kennel or put my dog up but I'm not going to lock a member of my family in my room for hours or pay to have him boarded. I have tried to find a compromise and said we could have our party later in January and make it an adult only affair if they really wanted it at my house but that was met with even more push back. Even though we have had adult only gatherings at my previous place because of my dog, but apparently Christmas is different. \n\nAm I really being an asshole here? I just want everyone to be safe.\n\nEdit - \nI do want to add a couple things because I've mentioned them a few times.\n\n1) My dog was severely mistreated by the children of his first family. He is terrified of children. We have put in a lot of training, and he is a very, very well trained dog (including crate trained), but there is only so much training can helped. We have gotten to the point that he will ignore kids that aren't in his space, or aren't actively approaching him, but that's where he has gotten stuck. \n\n2) I have hosted multiple other times at my house. My friend's have had no problem with adult only gatherings until this time. Our holiday gathering is a pot luck.

It is a problem.", "Your dog just isn\u2019t good around kids?\nI don\u2019t think you should be expected to host people with their kids if you\u2019re willing to host other times.\nEven without the consider of the dog I think it\u2019s good enough to host an adult event", "So...why can't you kennel him for a few hours? You had a Halloween party with kids without raising a stick about it so why change your mind now? Seems like you're just done hosting and trying to find excuses", "My dog is actually create trained. He doesn't mind his crate and is quite happy there. But he was severely mistreated by children in his first family and I know that having kids in his home and having to hear them for hours would severely upset him. I have worked so hard on making this a safe place for him and working on making sure he just ignores kids and I am just afraid that having kids running through the house yelling would undo all that.", "It's not an antisocial space, it's an anti-child space. \n\nOP has commented, repeatedly that they've hosted adult only events with no issues at all. So the dog is not anti social or causing OP to be anti social.", "What kind of party only lasts two hours?", "That seems a bit excessive. \n\nSome people don't have child friendly homes, for a variety of reasons. Not just a pet that is upset by children. \n\nIf OP is not avoiding the children completely by skipping events at houses that are child friendly, and hosting adult only events in their home, why is there an implication that they may not be a welcome member of the group anymore?", "I think you're right. One kid can decide to open the bedroom door or crate and let the dog out. Then everyone's at risk through no fault of OP.", "she said her dog is kennel trained, but maybe it\u2019s more on her side she feels it\u2019s unfair for him to be cooped up for her friends kids to have fun", "Now there's an idea!", "Why not put the small children in the smaller safe space for 4 hours so that they don't disturb the dog that lives there?", "Okay but that only gets so far. I have worked with him for two years. He's to the point he will ignore kids that aren't in his bubble and not actively approaching him but he has been stuck in this mode for a while. I am okay with that. I took this dog in knowing he probably would never be able to be around children and that's fine. He was severely abused. We manage.", "Thank you for reading through my comments. My poor boy was severely mistreated by children at one point in his life and he is terrified of them. We have been working on it but I will never be comfortable having him around kids. He is also a large dog and I don't trust baby gates enough to contain him. I know having kids in his space will upset him horribly.", "They've actually been fine not visiting with their kids for years. My house, even pre-dog, was always the \"adult\" hang out. This is the first time they've ever push back on it because they've all been more than happy to have adult only nights.", "I scrolled further down and saw that, but what was going to make me scroll back up is when I saw a comment that some of your friends' kids are severely loud and uncontrolled.\n\nI was gonna obviously stick with NTA. It sounds like you're doing fine, and your friends need to learn that they need to also train their kids.", "So you put him in his crate in a room with a white noise machine in it or the TV on or whatnot. Lock that room. Done.", "Soul destroying? Are you kidding me?", "A good dog owner can choose to take their dog out two hours into a party, as I do. For a walk, to be social, to pee. Owner here says their party lasts 4.", "It seems like you attend events with the friends children. Why are you so opposed to hosting one. Getting a vibe you don\u2019t want kids at your house. If so be upfront with your friends and let the chips fall where they may.", "Good for you for actually standing up for your dogs well-being!!", "Thank you for clarifying you're a woman. I just use they until someone tells me otherwise so as not to offend. \n\nI totally respect your view, like I said ultimately it's your home.\n\nI know the stress and frustration of this kind of situation, and I just feel like the more time that passes the more pushback and passive aggressive comments from friends will come...\n\nI am just saying we have found several solutions over the years through trial and error. \n\nOur oldest pup was severely abused by children, so much so that we only walk her at odd hours so as to avoid kids in parks and whatnot. She freaks out with kids, loses it.\n\nDogs find comfort in a burrow set up. Noise from a party can be drowned out by a radio, tv, or smart phone.\n\nWhere I am coming from is not a place of judgment really. More just a different view now that I have found several solutions to ease my fur babies and realize that it's not so traumatic to them if you are able to create a space for them.\n\nI just know that kids are a big part of some peoples lives. (Most inevitably)\n\nIt's hard to navigate friendship with different central priorities. \n\nFor you it's your fur baby, like it is for us. For your friends, it's their kids and they don't wanna go to another holiday party without them it seems.\n\nI don't think your friends should bully you into doing something you're not comfortable with, I just think that this is doable is all.\n\nGirl, do what you want. I would be your friend too btw, wasn't trying to insult you in a response or anything. Just was confused why the dude replying was so interested in my thoughts...", "It\u2019s not reasonable to expect you to crate your dog except for a short visit. A Christmas party is probably going to be longer than that.\n\nIt\u2019s like demanding the kids each stay inside of a pack and play the whole time.", "Makes sense. I realllllly want to try Dr. Amy Cook\u2019s play way course. I might bite the bullet in the new year - I just don\u2019t want to give money to Denise Fenzi (whose online platform hosts the course) - good luck with your pup though :)", "Sure thing! I have no idea why my comment migrated down here from top level. I have 2 rescue dogs and I understand and appreciate not wanting to risk anything - I think it would be a great goal if you could work up to a situation where friends with kids could visit over time (with management and barriers) - but good luck OP :)", "I'm confused as to what they are planning on doing with their children at your home. If you're anything like me, the only  toys in my home are balls, kongs and squeaky toys. Do kids use snuffle mats? I could maybe clean out one of the puzzle toys and put Espresso beans in it for the kids?", "Not every dog is the same and your point about friendships has been made thrice now; give up dude", "Again, because it's not safe to have kids around my dog. My dog is in my house. So they cannot bring their kids, to my house. Because my dog is there.", "It's not a \"vibe\", he was very clear that he doesn't want kids at his house.\n\nAnd you can totally attend events with kids without wanting them in your own space.", "You can\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s house & tell them they should get rid of their kids\u2026.it\u2019s almost like guests demanding you remove your dog from your own home\u2026it\u2019s fucking rude.", "Dog crating is abhorrent, and practically unheard of outside of the US.", "It's not their turn, they were voluntold they should host because they have a new home. A new home that likely isn't childproofed, due to the owners not having children.", "Haha no I get it. That's why my poor boy is like he is too. His first family was not kind to him at all. It's so sad. I have been around my friend's kids though and they are all very loud; I just don't think I can drown out all their noise, even though he is properly crate trained and loves his crate. I'm willing to work around to find a solution but unfortunately that solution won't be me locking my dog in another room.", "Hahaha Yeah that's a pretty good point. My husband and I are pretty minimalist. We really don't have much for kids to do. Even our Christmas movie selection is pretty abysmal. Do kids like Silent Night, Deadly night?", "Having kids myself, it really doesn\u2019t take too much keeping them occupied for a few hours. A few toys from home and other kids helps too.", "My dog howls at the door to whatever room he's left in. Not all dogs enjoy being locked in a room.", "Not all dogs take to crates\u2026 my dogs would lose their mind. I was worried they\u2019d harm themselves in their desperation to get out.", "I crate train but my dogs would be very distressed if they were crated for hours with people home, especially a party that would be noisy. It sounds like OP\u2019s house just invent isn\u2019t kid compatible, not that his dog means he can never have anyone over.", "He isnt taking his dog to their house though??", "Op has been attending these things for years without hosting. It IS their turn.", "Have you talked with the parents about the kids not running around like maniacs and screaming? I mean I understand kids will be kids, but often times parents forget these are young people that can understand inside voices and parking it in front of a tv for a holiday movie with snacks?\n\nJust because they are kids doesn't mean they get to run around your house.\n\nDo you have a room large enough to support the kiddos for a movie extravaganza so your pup could roam a bit?\n\nIf not then tell your friends to find a different party spot. \n\nYou sound like you've made up your mind, just a solution focused brain this morning I guess.", "My child is an adult. My home is mostly puppy proofed, but is in no way child proofed. My dog doesn't have opposable thumbs and a death wish like most young children do.", "My dog is so ecstatic about his crate that he won't sleep anywhere else. If he wants a nap he grabs his favorite plushie and comes up and hits me with it over and over til I take him to his crate and put him in. He loves that damn crate, its his personal bed.", "We have a large dog (bull arab, around 60kgs) and while he is very sqeet and friendly, he is a BIG boy! it boggles my mind constantly how people will watch you get him off to the side of the pathway so there's distance between you and them, and then try and get his attention or walk over while you'e trying to keep them still and calm.  \n\n\nLeave my dog alone, for real!", "They didn't say they've never hosted, they said that they haven't hosted in their new home with their new dog. It was suggested they host because their new home is bigger. They said they would host adults. At the very least, they should crate or lock away the kids if they're bringing them to OP's home.", "They've said multiple times they do host. The hosted a Halloween party recently.", "read her comments before saying stuff like this", "Most people naturally care more about the pets they choose than the ones their friends choose to keep.", "You just keep human children as pets?", "Im so glad it was just water I was drinking when I read this", "You seem like an awesome dog parent! I would watch TikToks of you and your dog!", "Hope you never have a pet ever. I'm sure you would severely abuse and beat them."]}
