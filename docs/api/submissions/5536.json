Vet med worker, shelter worker, owned animals for my whole life (border collies are the family go to dog) and some animals just don\u2019t like men, women, kids, people with hats, etc. like you said sometimes training helps and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I would always cross the street with our dogs if I saw someone coming towards us, especially kids. They are fast and loud and the border collies never react well to that. I\u2019ve had kids run into the street, without looking, to cross to come towards us even when I\u2019m yelling \u201cmy dog isn\u2019t friendly\u201d and the parents are like \u201coh it\u2019s ok animals love my kid\u201d like I don\u2019t know my dog best? I\u2019ve had to take off sprinting to get away, and our dogs are always well trained so I can get their attention back because a running screaming kid sets them off and they\u2019re ready to \u201cdefend\u201d me from the \u201cattacker\u201d.", "He is properly crate trained. It's more the principle. I think it's bat shit that people are demanding that I lock my dog up, who is a member of my family, so they can bring their kids over. That's really entitled to me.", "Maybe your own dumb dog and friendships, leave other people's bonds with their pets alone", "You actually don\u2019t. You can think your opinion has value (even if it doesn\u2019t) but that doesn\u2019t fundamentally change OPs mind. So no, you don\u2019t get to decide.", "\u201cYou who have pets have control issues. But I, who feel it\u2019s my place to decide what strangers have a bond with, do not.\u201d You sound like a peach.", "I wasn\u2019t going to open the door to that in this conversation. Dogs like and naturally want dens. There is a reason that my 8 year old snuggledoof seeks out the dark corner in the closet on our pile of clothes for his good naps, and I really only properly crate trained him as a little puppy so people could come and go from our place (maintenance in an apartment) without undo stress to him and those people. He travels well, chills well, and most importantly feels safe because he has security in his own home and the spaces designated for him. When dog averse, nervous, or unpredictable people are in his home, it\u2019s good protection that he can be by himself and rest and chew on a stuffy or whatever.\n\n(And fuck yeah noise machine, I only just realized this year that the thing we use as a family every night would give him extra peace if someone had to come in to fix something when we were out!)\n\nThere is no unkindness from separating your dog from chaos and giving space to relax while unpredictable people are over. There\u2019s also nothing rational to me about alienating human friends when pets are safely away for a while.", "I have seen dogs that just are better off in child free situations. I have a breed of dog that is fantastic BUT I would never recommend them for children. I don\u2019t blame you for protecting all involved as far as the kids and your dog. Better safe, than sorry is a cliche that is applicable here!", "Australian Cattle Dog owner here. Spot on. I will NEVER understand people insisting their kids are going to be ok with a known dog, let alone a completely random one! For that matter, there are adults who want to pet my dogs( All dogs like me), while my dogs clearly don\u2019t want attention from them. Very weird flex, IMHO. I will admire a dog from afar, but never will I be pushy. I don\u2019t get it. Sadly, I have seen dogs PTS or given up because of \u201ckids and dogs\u201d stereotype. Not all dogs like all people. And THAT is ok!", "Maybe I'm outside the norm here, but I grew up in the suburbs where everyone had a dog. 99% of gatherings, they were closed in another room or in their crate to prevent disrupting the event. It's not rare, cruel, or impractical. You don't have to like it, but you should recognize that what they're asking for is common and reasonable.", "I don't keep animals as pets I'm not a weirdo with control, domination, and misanthropic issues", "Now his friends think he's a selfish prick that cares more about a stupid dog", "Yeah, it\u2019d be awful if somebody is crating 16 hours a day for months, but 4 hours for a party?  Piece of cake.", "100% that is my biggest fear. Is my dog having to be put down for being \u201caggressive\u201d when it\u2019s not my fault someone can\u2019t control their kid. I\u2019ve had to assist with many \u201cbehavior\u201d euthanasias at the shelter for dogs that honestly we all feel could have been safely adopted out, but because of their bite history we didn\u2019t have a choice. Like a stiff body, hard stare and tail held completely still is not a friendly sign, train your kids!!", "It sounds like you have some personal issues to work out.", "People who are mean about animals are the worst kind of human.", "One hundred percent. I don\u2019t crate my dog on the regular; when we\u2019re out, he has run of the bedroom where he has every cozy spot + two beds available. But he knows his travel carrier means he is safe and coming with us, his crate means he\u2019s safe and nobody is going to bother him, and the whole bedroom with door closed means it is time to chill and sleep. None of these things are punishment or cruel, and each situation is typically two hours max. If I have to fly from California back East, it means 4 hours with lots of mom scratchies of reassurance (and tbh he\u2019s always asleep when I check on him in his travel carrier).\n\nMore often than not if I put him away when people are over, it\u2019s for his own peace.", "I choose humans over dogs, sorry weirdo", "Lol", "I doubt any human chooses you."]}
