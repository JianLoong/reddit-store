Throwaway account for reasons.\n\nI have been lucky to have a group of about ten friends that get together on a somewhat regular basis. As often as adults can get together when they are in their 30's anyway. We all met in college. Every year for the past ten years, we have had a Christmas celebration either before or after the holidays, depending on everyone's schedule. People take turns hosting.\n\nI recently bought a larger house, so it was suggested that I host at mine. I said I didn't think that would be a good idea and have been getting flack for it, and a few people have told me I'm being an asshole. \n\nMy reason is my dog. I have a large younger dog who cannot stand kids. About half the friend group have had kids in the past few years and there are 6 kids under the age of five in the group. I do not see that going well at all. \n\nA couple people have suggested that I kennel or put my dog up but I'm not going to lock a member of my family in my room for hours or pay to have him boarded. I have tried to find a compromise and said we could have our party later in January and make it an adult only affair if they really wanted it at my house but that was met with even more push back. Even though we have had adult only gatherings at my previous place because of my dog, but apparently Christmas is different. \n\nAm I really being an asshole here? I just want everyone to be safe.\n\nEdit - \nI do want to add a couple things because I've mentioned them a few times.\n\n1) My dog was severely mistreated by the children of his first family. He is terrified of children. We have put in a lot of training, and he is a very, very well trained dog (including crate trained), but there is only so much training can helped. We have gotten to the point that he will ignore kids that aren't in his space, or aren't actively approaching him, but that's where he has gotten stuck. \n\n2) I have hosted multiple other times at my house. My friend's have had no problem with adult only gatherings until this time. Our holiday gathering is a pot luck.

Since we love dogs, we don't want to make dogs scared.  So in order to make this pup feel safe, we need to not go near this pup.    \nThis **only** works if the parents are on board with making this a teachable moment for their child, and the child has been raised to listen and respect boundaries.

Could you explain that they could be helping the pup if they gave him space so he could learn that kids can be safe?

Maybe with a TV or radio playing if they're worried about child sounds upsetting the dog. OP can even go in occasionally and check on the dog to give it some attention. \n\nIt's weird.

Awhile back it showed me this very popular \"letter to reactive dog owners\" post about how heroic people are who adopt dogs that are so unstable they can never leave their house for more than an hour or so, can never go on vacation, and can never, ever have anyone visit them at their home. It sounded like a hostage situation.", "Actually they're right. I'm an animal behaviourist and isolation becomes torture for dogs remarkably quickly. They're pack animals.

Not all anxious or destructive dogs have bad owners, especially when it comes to puppies. There's all sorts of temperaments and trauma that could be involved. Many pups have separation anxiety at that age and will cry or bark if locked up for hours. \n\nOP knows their own pet, it's still young, and THEY are saying this isn't a good idea. Trust them, don't project judgements that they're not a good enough owner.", "I think that it's a bit natural to not want children in a childfree and non-childproof house.

If a child gets hurt then OP is liable. \n\nAlso, not all dogs are going to handle being kenneled, when there's a party at the house, well. Some dogs are going to be vocal the whole time and anxious about the situation. Kennel trained doesn't always mean that they will be quiet when they hear a bunch of people. \n\nIn the end I think that it would be better/safer for everyone if they chose a different location. It might have just been easier to rent a hall/party rooms at this point. If someone was worried about all of the work they could've offered with the condition of OP helping them. OP could also section off his house so that children have certain areas that they are allowed in.

OP has stated multiple times that they were told to host Christmas, not asked, simply because they have a big house. It wasn\u2019t even really \u201ctheir turn,\u201d as they had hosted an adults-only Halloween party recently. That was the holiday before the last, so only one event in between (thanksgiving), and they demand they host again so soon? Assuming that they only host holidays and don\u2019t celebrate other December holidays, since they\u2019re celebrating Christmas, and don\u2019t do big get-togethers not on holidays (but considering the timing, not a lot of time in between to have many get-togethers not on holidays). They have also hosted many other events that were adults-only, even before the dog. Even if the dog wasn\u2019t there, the friends have no right to DEMAND OP host children in their home, especially children that are so young (in a home that is not child-proofed or even supplied with things that would entertain kids) especially after they have already hosted an event recently (and even suggested hosting a different holiday that\u2019s adults-only as a compromise).\nNow onto the dog reasoning, which only further solidifies the friends as entitled assholes. The dog is terrified of kids after being abused by kids previously. They are trained and well-behaved and can ignore kids if they are not approached, but they are still terrified, so having children in the house will still terrify them, even if the dog cannot see them. The dog can definitely still hear them, and as OP mentioned previously, their friends\u2019 kids are loud and rowdy and all under the age of 5 (which is fine, just not in OPs home, both before and after the dog was there, and they stated they never complained about them in others\u2019 homes). \n\nAgain, the kids are also under 5 and rowdy, and their parents will likely be drinking a little, playing games, etc, so their full attention will not be on their kids, so even if OP relented and locked the dog in a crate in a separate room (which they shouldn\u2019t and sounds like they won\u2019t), the kids will run around and explore the house, as they do, and may find the dog. Even if the door is locked, because the dog is scared, hearing them so close, probably banging on and shaking the door, will possibly cause them to bark or whine (even trained this can happen because they\u2019re scared and in this case the kids are approaching, not just nearby), which will cause the kids to become excited and scream for the dog. The parents, who have no grasp of the dogs fear, despite being told multiple times, will demand OP to let their kids play with the dog. Obviously OP won\u2019t relent in this, but all of this is a very likely scenario, as it has happened many many many times before (I have seen kids behave this way once finding out there\u2019s a dog in the house).", "Do not be bullied into changing your decision.
