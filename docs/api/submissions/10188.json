That's how we became friends. He obviously has his own life, but he sometimes asks my mother for advice. We're both part of the same very tiny diaspora in the country we live in and because everyone knows everyone, everyone is either an aunty, uncle, or cousin.\n\nBesides all of that, we became friends because of mutual friends. The relationship has always been platonic.\n\nEven though we knew him in passing, he's been a part of our lives since April 2020.\n\nNot inviting him was not my decision. My parents wanted a trip with just them and their kids. Inviting him wasn't ever even considered.\n\nAs for who's funding the trip, my parents would have paid for everything, and he would pay them back on a later date.\n\n\nOriginal post:\n\nMy friend (35 m) and i (28 f) became friends about 3 yrs, and he's become a part of the family. \n\nMy dad retired a few months ago, and to celebrate we're going on a family vacation. It's only me, my parents, my brother and his wife. It's the first vacation we'll be taking together in almost a decade. \n\nBut my friend is now extraordinarily mad at me because i didn't invite him. We've travelled together before, but it's been with other friends, and i didn't really wanna include him in something that was exclusively just immediate family, regardless of the relationship my parents have with him. He told me if my sister in law was invited, it wouldn't really be a problem of he was invited too, because she's technically not related to us either, and our vacation spot was on his bucket list. \n\nHe's also started to cause problems in our friend circle because of this, and at this point i feel like he doesn't want me to have fun unless it includes him.", "created_utc": 1676638615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114jp0s/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_on_a_family/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is either a Nice Guy who thinks he\u2019s in a close relationship with you or a moocher who thinks you owe him.  If he went on the trip who would be paying?  Your parents?

Unless your father, whose trip this is, has asked him or told you that he really wants this guy there, which you didn't mention, I cannot see any reason for the guy's entitlement. What exactly does \"become a part of the family\" (in just 3 years) mean here?\n\nHe's complaining to friends about this? On what basis, that he \"wouldn't be a problem?\" That he somehow is family (again, in what way exactly)?\n\nYou SIL is, in fact, family. He is not, and if he thinks he is, you need to disabuse him of that notion.\n\nHe can go on his \"bucket list\" vacation some other way.

Family only is pretty clear.", "Does dude think you 2 are in a full on serious relationship? To compare himself to the WIFE of your brother is concerning.  So many red flags can come from this.

Like are your parents saying that to him directly or is it just a situation where he is invited to events with family members. I'm not sure what his own relationship with his family is like so is he using yours as a pseudo one and that illusion just broke?", "NTA...I should stop being surprised at the level of some people's entitlement.  So the only \"logical reason\" he has forwarded is that a person with non-shared DNA is coming... and that person is your sister-in-law.

I was essentially \"adopted\" into my best friends family when i was young. Went on vacations with them and stayed at their house many times. I also understood that there may be times his mom and dad just wanted family time with their blood born children. They also got all the latest electronics that were coming out (we are talking early to mid 90s). Not once did i ever make them feel shitty about getting anything or being able to go anywhere without me. He seriously needs to understand his position with everyone. Yes, he's as close to being blood relative as he can get, but he will never be at that point as he simply isn't.", "Than what\u2019s his logic to be included on the trip?! End your friendship and tell him it\u2019s due to his demands.", "I think that might be the crux of this reaction than. He sees you and your family as his own 'immediate' family even though you don't see it the same way. I might be wrong and this just could be him being selfish and wanting to go on a vacation because it is on his bucket list but from what was in your post, despite his delusions of comparing himself to your sister in law, he is starting to realise that he sees this familial relationship different than others do and is a bit bitter. At least that makes a lot more sense than those jumping to \"DOES HE LOVE YOU?!\". \n\nIf he isn't willing to have a calm discussion about the situation then there isn't really anything you can do. Especially when he is attempting to die on this hill by causing problems in your friend circle. Just go and enjoy your family vacation and leave him to reflect or fester.", "That's it, he's a pseudo cousin.", "So my kids had a lot of pseudo aunt's and uncles.  In fact, we referred to them as Uncle John, Uncle Nick, Aunt Del...\n\nBut they weren't invited to family dinners, or family birthday parties, or the kids' school events.\n\nAnd they certainly weren't invited to family vacations.  Nor did they try to invite themselves.\n\nYou are NTA.  Your friend is TA.\n\nETA to add: The person who plans the trip and fronts the costs gets to decide who they invite and want to spend time with.  Anyone not invited (EVEN IF ACTUALLY A FAMILY MEMBER) gets to find other things to do.", "He is wrong. You are correct.", "NTA he isn\u2019t a significant other.", "NTA! Wow, the audacity made my jaw drop!", "This is very, very strange behavior, OP. I actually think it is a red flag for you. Something is going on with your friend\u2026 either he is just plain entitled as others have mentioned, or he is codependent and has somehow enmeshed himself into your life and your family, or there is another issue related to his mental health. But this is not normal. Please safeguard your boundaries fiercely. NTA and I hope you enjoy your trip.", "Nta. If your sister in law is married into the family then yes, she is part of the Family in a way that your friend isn't. In a legally binding way. \nHe needs to not be so clingy.", "Def NTA but that said if you can rule out creep tendencies it's possible he's more attached to your family than you lot are to him and he's totally unaware of that imbalance. If he doesn't have a proper family of his own, latching onto yours seems likely (I'd know from personal experience). Still, you or your family are not under any obligation to invite him let alone front/pay for him at all. So this perceived slight from you might actually turn out to be for the good so he can ground his relationship and realize what he's assuming need's a bit of a reality check.", "Im gonna go against the grain and it\u2019s NaH he probably felt like fmaily after his aunt passed and likely now had none of his own and this reminded thata smith as you love him he isn\u2019t fmaily .

It\u2019s more sad than anything really", "Your criticism is fair, and i don't expect you to change your opinion, but i think this needs a bit of cultural context.

You made it seem like he was only connected to your family via you. Instead, he is claimed as part of your extended family and that\u2019s how you know him.

He really thinks at you all as his family, you all treated him like family and he wasn't going to come as a free-loader.\n\nI will change it to nobody is an A. Because he really isn't.\n\nAnd you aren't for not inviting him because it's not your vacation, it's your father's, but i didn't like the way you presented him.", "NTA.  Damn, I can't believe how entitled some people are out there in this world.", "Your edit was unnecessary because there\u2019s nothing to explain.  It\u2019s a family vacation.  He\u2019s not family.  SIL is family, so his argument about that doesn\u2019t stand up.  He\u2019s completely in the wrong.\n\nLet him be mad.  You\u2019re not responsible for his feelings.  Go enjoy your vacation.

NTA.", "NTA, your SIL IS technically part of the family, that's what happens when you get married, what?", "NTA, knows yo mama he can call her and ask the fact that he didnt means he knows he isnt invited. he just wants someone to blame and that unfortunately is you OP.", "It seems he wants more than a platonic friendship.", "NTA. Your SIL is family by marriage. He is just a friend of the family and a very entitled greedy one.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Of course your brothers wife is going. She\u2019s married to your brother. He\u2019s being ridiculous.", "Since his aunt raised him, he may see her as a mother figure despite their aunt-nephew relationship. Since your mother has taken over the role of aunt, he may now see her as a mother figure to the point where he sees you as a sibling.\n\nMajor digression here. \n\nMy father married a woman with a son a year younger than my sister. Then my father adopted him, so he is both my stepbrother and my half brother.\n\nHad this happened when I was a kid, we would have grown up together, even if my sister and I only spent about a quarter of our time at their house. As an adult, I might now have had feelings of closeness to him the same as I have with my sister.\n\nBut I was 17 when they got together, and I moved out of my mother's house and across the country at 18. When I lived in the dorms, I came home during winter and spring break, but I spent my summer break in summer housing. My sister, who is two years younger, and we're still in high school, spent a lot of her summers with them, and she went to college one state over, which made coming home for breaks easier. She had a much closer relationship with her stepbrother.\n\nMy father's parents accepted my stepbrother as a grandchild. More distant relatives treated him like a close family friend of ours. My aunt and uncle didn't really see him as a nephew, my cousins didn't see him as a cousin. We didn't have the long shared history of our childhoods together.\n\nMy sister and I have a relationship outside of our parents. When our parents die, we will still be sisters. I haven't seen my stepbrother since my father died.\n\nAll of this is to say that he may feel like he is your brother and your mother has stepped into the role of his parent figure. And your family doesn't see him the same way.\n\nI am not sure if there's a way to explain this it doesn't make him feel like he's no longer a part of your family now. You could say that this is like trying to re-create the experience of a family vacation from your childhood. Except that your sister-in-law is coming along. Which I think is totally appropriate, but it does change the vibe, and I'm not sure how to explain all of this to him without damaging the relationship.\n\nI suppose it's about how close your mother feels to him, and how important it is to her that he feel like he has a maternal figure in her.\n\nAnd I wish I knew how old all of you are. Obviously you and your brother are adults. I think it would be easier for him to not feel like this adds to his abandonment if all of you were in your 30s instead of in your 20s.", " Yes, your SIL is a part of the family because she married into it.", "unexpected Wimpy", "This is a bad post.\n\nYou're declaring OP to be an AH for not including info that doesn't even change anything about whether he should be invited on the trip.", "I'm 28, my brother is 25 and my friend is currently 35 and entered our lives when he was 32/33. \nHis mother got ill when he was about 8, and ultimately passed when he was 14. His aunt moved in with them after that to take care of the kids. His father passed when he was 17, and he left the house at 18. My mother and his aunt were in the same community social club but since there was a 30+ year age difference between them, I don't think they became friendly until my mum was older.", "NTA.  SIL is part of the family.  He dies not get to invite himself because it is on his bucket list.  That is not the purpose of this trip.", "NTA. Your parents planned the trip and SIL counts as family. He's quite entitled", "a) NTA  \nb) ex-friend  \nc) he probably wanted more than friends, but he's shit that bed.", "Then he can go on his own vacation he pays for himself.  He\u2019s not a member of your family.  Your SIL is.  So either he thinks he\u2019s your BF and should go (although a BF is not a member of the family yet either) or he feels he ought to be invited and is fine having a tantrum when he isn\u2019t invited.  Either way - WAY too much entitlement on his end. I\u2019d back way off this \u201cfriendship\u201d because this is veering into creepy territory."]}
