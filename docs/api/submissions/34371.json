But when you open the back door so the dog can have a shit you don't expect to have to be replacing neighbours toys that have been flown into your garden", "Not if it\u2019s in his yard", "So if you have a dog and I then break into your own property and your dog bits me, can I then rightfully and morally so sue you that your dog bit me. Even though it was me who was trespassing.", "I tend to agree with ESH in this scenario. \nThe kids because they should have been honest.  And no you should not have to pay.   It may have broken on impact.   And there is a risk with those types of toys if you dont know how to use them.\n\nYou however seem overly annoyed by your neighbors kids.    You said this happens twice per week.  So it does not sound like these are little hellions purposefully tossing items into your yard to bother you.    Balls fly over fences.   Learning to control remote control planes takes time...it was an accident.   You reap what you sow.   You have a kid.   Someday it may be their toy accidently going over that fence . Think about how you would want your neighbors to treat your kid, and don't be a dick.\n\nAlso, be honest you were annoyed not busy.\n You said you were in middle of giving a toddler a bath.. but kept answering the door?  And if you knew it was airplane you would have went out?   Nah you were annoyed and wanted to teach them a lesson and now feel bad.", "Yea, let's:\n\n1. Let kids into our house unsupervised by their parents\n2. Send the kids out the back, with a dog, with no supervision. \n3. And have to wait to let them out again; negating the lack of time.\n\nDo people think anything through anymore?", "Disagree. NTA because OP has no obligation to drop what they\u2019re doing regardless of how important you think what they\u2019re doing is.", "As someone who works from home I can't disagree with this thought processes enough. OPs dog was in their fenced in back yard, which is entirely their property. Just because they work from home or even if they were just enjoying a day off they should not be under any obligation to stop what they are doing to retrieve a toy that someone else had fall into their back yard, nor should they be responsible for damages to said item because their dog was confined to their property. \n\nJust because someone works from home doesn't mean their day is all feet up on the couch watching Netflix. We work, no different than if we worked in a corporate office building. You wouldn't expect someone to leave their regular job for a few minutes to retrieve something, so why should a remote employee be expected to? Especially if they are in meetings or calls, those fancy headsets we use are still limited in range which ties us to our workspace.", "You have NO idea why they couldn't go outside earlier and for that matter,  it's NO ONE'S business. A crisis on your part DOES NOT necessarily equate to an emergency on mine. The dog is INNOCENT.  He was in HIS own yard.", "Ok maybe we could have got out a bit sooner but my wife was in a work meeting and I was with our 3 year old son in the bath, I thought \"busy\" would have covered it in the post but obviously not.", "No? OP has no obligation to drop everything* he's doing to go look especially when the kid lied about the situation (understandably, he's a kid who likely felt shame) and OP made decisions based on the info he was told. \n\n*Especially during a work day.", "thing is the dog could also be severely hurt if it swallowed any pieces. in that case would the neighbours be responsible for the vet bill?", "So just because someone knocks, we are required to answer?", "knock knock", "Had OP had all the necessary information, the situation may have had a better outcome, but when they\u2019re the one being inconvenienced, they should be able to take action at a time when it\u2019s convenient for them (not the person who is inconveniencing them).\n\nI\u2019ve known people who have binned anything that comes over their fence. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that myself, but I guess it means it\u2019s the first and last time that particular object is going to land in their yard.", "The horror that a dog gets to play in the yard for an hour and 10 minutes.  How do the wolves and foxes and coyotes survive?", "So what if it was? I have 2 big indoor dogs who like to lay in the sun a couple hours every day. What are you trying to imply?", "INFO\n\nwhat is your social security number", "Lmao we're talking about a remote-control plane. Literally controlled via remote (as it says in the name). Just don't fly it over someone else's property and you don't have to worry about a dog eating it.\n\nMoreover, no one is paying OP to retrieve those toys and balls; it is not their responsibility. What if everyone went out to eat in the 10 minutes between the knocks and there was no one there to even answer the door?", "No...you should never let children that aren't yours just have free reign to run in the back yard. What if they trip on a dog bone and get hurt? OP would be liable. What if they let the dog out by accident? At 10 years old they are old enough to not let their shit fly into the neighbors yard every week, but clearly have a responsibility problem, OP should absolutely not let them into his back yard ever.", "I'm also really hoping they located and examined the battery to make sure the dog didn't eat it or break it.", "Except pet insurance won't cover anything and tell you that you haven't yet met your deductible.", "You\u2019re killin\u2019 me, Smalls!", "That movie is 30 years old. That realization was like a punch in the stomach. One of my favorite movies as well.", "I doubt it. If you\u2019ve got outdoor kids playing football (soccer) against the fence, or tennis or anything really, the ball can go over a lot. Doesn\u2019t equate to deliberately harassing the dog. Just being careless.", "I guess it depends on the density of the neighborhood, but I highly doubt it. My neighbor kid\u2019s balls and toys end up in my trees, on top of my pergola, you name it just in the course of playing. They aren\u2019t antagonizing me and I don\u2019t have a dog. Kids just don\u2019t have much control over these things/accidents happen. There is currently a toy plane in one of my trees.", "Why did they lie that it was a ball?", "A 10 year old is more than capable of being responsible for their own belongings.", "I get the plane since it's a new toy, but it doesn't explain why these kids keep throwing their ball on OP's property, few times a week at that.\n\nThey're being irresponsible, it keeps happening so often and it doesn't seem like the kids or their parents are trying to do anything about it.", "It takes a lot of practice for an adult to learn how to fly those things, to simply give one to a 7 year old...", "Situation was easily managed- went to the park to play cricket and football \ud83d\udc4d \nSoccer has a goal so that wasn\u2019t an issue \n\nI never expected my neighbours to drop everything to return a ball/frisbee though", "Ask the burglar who fell on the knife and then sued the homeowner. \ud83d\ude02", "Bad analogy... America has entered the chat", "Dog bites are a pretty strict liability which means the owner is always responsible for a dog attack. In a lot of places you could rightfully sue someone. In the case of a home invasion you would likely lose the suit as you were breaking the law which contributed to the attack.\n\nIf the child had gone in to the backyard to retrieve the toy without the homeowner\u2019s knowledge and been bit they could sue and quite likely win. Whether or not it\u2019s morally right to sue in that situation is up for debate.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the next part is true, I\u2019m not a lawyer. I have heard though that a \u201cbeware of dog\u201d sign can actually hurt the owner\u2019s chances of winning. Apparently having such a sign is seen as an acknowledgment that you know your dog is a risk.", "Top comment IMO", "They are obligated for destruction of property cause by their dog though\u2026", "You are still responsible for damaged caused to another\u2019s property even if it\u2019s within your own yard.", "But you are still responsible.  You do not gain ownership just by it landing in your yard.", "Just so you know, this subreddit is full of actual children. I mean literally kids under 13, kids who aren't even old enough to legally be on Reddit. \n\nAs far as they are concerned, you're the bad guy simply for being a grown up. They think you should have left your baby in the tub to drown so that a fellow child didn't have to wait an extra 10 seconds for their toy.", "It takes you over an hour to wash a 3yo?   My kids were pretty much capable of not drowning themselves in the bath.  Yours was as well since you left them to get the door.", "OP did answer 3 times", "In backyards? Idk. I've never seen one in my backyard. Did see a coyote cowering in the vestibule of a business downtown years ago. It wasn't doing well at all, probably a BCS of 1.5/5. But it was picked up and taken to the local wildlife rehab.", "By asking if the dog was outside the entire 70 minutes, I'm trying to imply that it would be helpful to me to know if the dog was outside for the entire 70 minutes.\n\nCool story about your dogs.", "I don't have a social security number, sorry. Wish I could help you", "That\u2019s BS. I have Nationwide Pet Insurance and we have been using it for cancer treatments. Last year they covered over $7500 towards chemotherapy only had to pay $500 yearly premium and a $250 annual deductible. We only had one bill not reimbursed. We hit the annual cap a week before the yearly policy roll over. Just got a $500 check from them to cover last week\u2019s chemotherapy.", "yeah, pretty much what I was gonna say - it's because they're kids that don't know what they're doing and should be supervised with a toy like that. I also wonder if OP has ever mentioned any of this to the parents?", "FWIW, there's literally Air Hog brand planes sold in the toy aisle at walmart, made for this age.  Super easy to fly, basically can ascend, descend, fly level, and turn.  Some do this all through two motors and speed adjustment (sort of like flying a tank but instead of going faster or slower, that makes it climb and descend.)\n\nBut it is a plane and it's easy to get away from a kid.", "Oh def I still feel bad for getting my brothers RC helicopter that he just got when he was 8 stuck in a tree when I was 12. Like he only had it for a month before it happened.  Even my stepdad at the time nearly got it stuck on the apartment complex roof", "What from my post gave away I'm American?", "Where I am from however if someone comes into my house without permission and dog bites, it is the trespassers own fault.", "A hundred times this! Other adults just need the word \"busy\" and they can fill in the rest with regular grown up stuff. My kids, on the other hand, can actually sit there watching me doing something and will still ask me, what do you mean by busy?!!", ">legally\n\nDid they finally pass that into law? Thank the Tsar Fish, time to start calling the cops.", "I mean are you? I was making a joke that a homeowner could some how be held responsible for a dog attack on a trespasser", "You gave no indication of where you\u2019re from and I made no assumption. I merely stated that depending on where someone resides the owner could possibly be liable. It would be bad advice to make a blanket statement on an international Internet forum that the owner wouldn\u2019t be liable.\n\nWhere I live (also not America) the owner is not liable if the intruder was committing, or intended to commit, illegal activity. However they may be liable if the person was not committing illegal activity, such as trying to retrieve a toy. This depends on the measures the dog owner has taken to control the animal. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve looked it up apparently where I live a warning sign is seen as something that can be used to control the risk.", "I don't understand you attempt at the joke sorry. I am not american.", "The where I am from is completely my bad, you and another person saying I was american had same profile pic and I incorrectly thought it was the same person. The point I initially was trying to make is that they had stuff in OP's yard. It is not ops fault the dog bit it or destroyed it whatever. It is the kids responsibility that stuff don't go over. My point on the dog biting a tresspasser is more of an extreme example. Basically stating its the trespassers responsibility not to be tresspassing, just like its the kids responsibility not to have their stuff constantly going over.", "I agree that it\u2019s not the owner\u2019s fault the dog destroyed stuff in their own yard. OP is definitely NTA in my opinion. \n\nMy first comment was solely a response to you putting forward the idea of whether or not someone could be sued for a dog bite on their own property."]}
