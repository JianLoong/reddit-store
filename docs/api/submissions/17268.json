Seriously GO TO THE HOSPITAL", "NTA: Your husband\u2019s family didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to ask if you were okay after searching for your dog in the woods while pregnant!

That being said.. they\u2019re huge AHs and your transgression in understandable given you\u2019re pregnant\u2026 the hormones and they let you go all that time in such stress and you fell?

Finally, you left your party early.\n\nWhat defense was your husband supposed to present?

I get that you were stressed, but you don't harass kids about the deaths of their pets. If the kid were old enough to be sensitive about what they say, it would be a different call, but an 8 year old doesn't understand what they're not supposed to say. This kid saw a parallel situation (dog ran off) and just parroted what others told him.\n\nYour sister is 36, she should understand that an 8 year old is just running at the mouth, and has no idea what they are saying. You don't need to correct a child on her behalf.", "Are you and the baby okay? Did you go to the doctor?", "NTA- You both need marital counseling. Your husband needs to learn how to be a husband.

You brought a dog to a strange place and didn't take care of him. You went alone into the woods like a crazy person and even fell on your stomach, which no caring pregnant woman would do. You need to be grateful your husband puts up with you", "My husband was looking for him, too\u2026 and a friend of his. That\u2019s it.

If I was getting yelled at, I would leave ealry too. What could her husband do? Help look for the dog, ask how she was once she got back instead of being more concerned about the cake, taken his pregnant wife to the hospital since she fell.

You telling me you cut off your OWN mother for this man. Fell on your stomach while pregnant HEAVILY at that and he didn\u2019t take your side. \n\nGay man to gay man. What the hell do you see in him to ignore all these GLARING red flags.", "I'm changing to NTA. Yeah it sounds like they all treat you like crap. In which case the kid outburst is not ideal, but understandable.\n\nSomeone needs to stand up to the family. Either you or your partner.", "Ok. I'm going to say YTA then. You took your anger out on the kid who didn't wrong you at all. And you didn't apologize to him. He may not have even known anything about your dog, he probably heard \"dog\" and remembered what his parents told him about his.", "OP speculated that he was told that his dog died after his own pet ran off a year previously. \n\nSo it sounds like he saw a similar situation, and repeated what he was told. Totally normal behavior for an 8 year old. \n\nAnd OP's sister is 36! She should know that an 8 year old is not the font of wisdom whose advice must be followed. There's no reason to get angry at the nephew or anybody.", "Agreed. Lots of parents of badly behaved 8 year olds under here don\u2019t agree.", "I\u2019ll take it.

NTA OP but please get out of this.", "1) all kids say stupid things that literally how they learn not to say them.\n2) maybe train you\u2019re dog not to run away to begin with.\n3) you hit my child for saying something based on his own experience then you\u2019d be digging a while for your damn dog", "First Time Mom", "Thas a nah from me ngl. It\u2019s supposed to be a celebration of you two and your unborn child.\n\nBut clearly that family doesn\u2019t see you as important if they can\u2019t understand the literal definition of a gender reveal party.  Hell your not only did you run in the woods searching for your dog even fell that sounds stressful and adding pregnancy on top of that\u2026. \n\nIdk why he would even say that about your dog too. \n\nI suggest you focus on yourself and your unborn child for now because if your willing to literally cut off the person that gave you life because of logical reasons and he can\u2019t even defend you\u2026\n\nHas his family always treated you with such disregard?", "And you\u2019d be digging for your brat for a while if you little as laid a hand on my baby.

Did you marry this man. \n\nYour telling me you\u2019ve been his ride or die for YEARS and he doesn\u2019t defend you when your not only carrying his fucking child but ALSO when his family being disrespectful Infront of you.", "NTA \n\nwhy is the sister yelling at you for a fabricated story her son made up? Her son told you the dog went into the river when he didn't and she believed him but goes to you to tell at you? \n\nThen when you tell the child that although you are sorry for him losing his dog it's not okay for him to lie about yours and you get in trouble for correcting the kid? \n\nThen people ignore you and prioritize themselves??? They make you the villain of the story and the husband just sits there and lets his family abuse you and this has not been the first time? \n\nHis family sounds AWFUL. he sounds like he was brewed from the bowels of hell and it also sounds like he has effectively isolated you from family and the ONE family you do have (sister) sounds like an enabler. \n\nWhat a nightmare! \n\nYou deserve SOOOO much more than what you're getting from this man and his flipping armpit stank of a family. \n\nYou have a full and beautiful life to live with your new upcoming baby! You have value and worth regardless of these people! Leave this man and I hope you can pursue a better more fulfilling life with your baby. And I hope.yiu can reconnect with family that are able to support you. \n\nNTA", "Yes, we\u2019re fine. We had an hour long scan thingy on my belly where they detect the heart and I press to say she moved.", "Good! I'm happy to hear that. I'm sorry everyone is so mean to you. I hope you get out of this situation soon.", "Either that or they meant first time mom. I'm honestly not quite sure which in this case.", "Is it a racial thing? Does his family resent you because you're Moroccan? What is their problem? And if your husband can't stand up for you he is honestly a lousy guy.
