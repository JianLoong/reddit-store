They were both in college and didn't think they could take care of me so I moved in with my paternal grandparents when I was born. My dad transferred to a school an hour away so even tho I didn't live with him I saw him every weekend and on school breaks. Bio mom just kinda fucked off. When I was almost 2 I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend, now wife. I'll be calling her my mom for the rest of the story. I think I finally met bio mom when I was like 5 or 6, she visits maybe once a year, and we talk like once a month. \n\nNow that I'm older, the way my bio mom's visits go is she gives me a few weeks notice that she's coming to visit, she gets a hotel, someone drops me off to go out to eat or shopping or something with her, picks me up a few hours later, and we do that like 2 or 3 times and call it a day (or year). \n\nSpring break is coming up and my school has 2 weeks off so my mom's gonna take me on a girls trip for the first week and a half. My brothers (8 and 10) have one week so my dad's gonna take them for a guy's thing for the first couple days then they're gonna meet up with me and my mom for a family vacation. I'm really excited for it. \n\nThe problem is my bio mom texted me a few days ago that she, her husband, and their kids are going to be here for the 1st week of my break. I made the mistake of telling her my mom and I will be going on vacation that week. She asked if I can have her move it to the 2nd week and I said no because we'll be on a family vacation then. She said something along the lines of \"great! You can have your stepmom (she refuses to call her my mom) cancel the first week and spend the week with us then you can go on your family vacation\". I told her I'm not going to have my mom cancel our trip and she got upset because her visiting with her husband and kids is a really big deal, I haven't seen them in 4 years and haven't met the younger 2, and she already booked the flights and hotel. I told her my mom also booked the flights and hotel and it's not fair to ask her to cancel it because she couldn't give me more than 2 weeks notice. \n\nShe got my dad involved and he's kinda pushing me to see my bio mom. He keeps saying my mom will understand if I skip the first week and meeting my half siblings is a big deal but I don't really care about them or my bio mom and really want to go on this vacation.", "created_utc": 1680317467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1288y8t/aita_for_not_skipping_or_shortening_a_vacation/", "score": 672, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like bio mom did not call to confirm that you would be available before she booked the trip. Your 15 and life is getting busier for you. You have a trip planned with your mom.

Your bio mom should have checked with your parents before making her plans.

She sounds like a great mom and will probably be understanding.", "NTA -  tell your biomom you're spending time with the mom who DIDN'T abandon you, and wants to be around you all the time. The one who doesn't occasionally deign to grace you with her presence, but was there all the time.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your bio mom's behavior in this situation is both childish and self-centered (i.e., giving you only 2 weeks notice, assuming you and your mom would just cancel your pre-planned trip, acting like meeting up with her and your half-siblings is more important than going on a vacation you're excited about). Ultimately, you should do what feels right and what YOU want to do. I think you'd be totally valid for choosing to go on vacation with your mom. I hope you do and I hope you have a wonderful time", "Leaning towards NTA. You're 15, you want to go on a vacation with your mom. I understand that your bio mom really wants to spend time with you but she can't force you into doing something while you already have plans.\n\nWhile I understand your bio mom might be upset, the reason I'm saying it's not N.A.H. is that she should have checked with you way beforehand to see if this was okay with you and communicated with your dad and mom.\n\nI think maybe try and find a common ground with your dad and mom to see maybe if you can free up some other time in the year to meet up with your bio mom but you are under no obligation to change your plans on such short notice", "NTA - Your bio mom should have given way more than just 2 weeks notice. It\u2019s very disrespectful of everyone involved. You\u2019ve already made plans with your mom for a girls trip that you are both excited about. It\u2019s important for girls especially around your age to spend quality time with their mom (btw blood doesn\u2019t make you a mom, being there Does\u2026which it sounds like your mom is there for you) it would be very rude and inconsiderate to cancel those plans even IF she was understanding. I\u2019m very close w/ my mom & stepmom. I hope that you can grow your relationship with your bio mom (& have a strong relationship w/ both) but it shouldn\u2019t be forced on you like this.

You don\u2019t - go have fun on vacation and they will just have to deal with it.", "Nta", "NTA\n\n\"I'm sorry you're disappointed but you really should have checked with my schedule before booking everything. I do want to see you so I hope next time we can work out our schedules together.\"", "nta - enjoy your girl\u2019s trip with the mom that loves & cares for you.", "NTA - you don't owe your bio mom your time and she certainly doesn't respect yours. Sometimes chosen family is the real family.", "NTA - Incredibly stupid of her not to check your availability before making plans. And pretty lame of your dad not to have your back.", "NTA. Your parents, your bio mom and you need to have a discussion about how she schedules time with you going forward. She should give more than two weeks notice because you\u2019re at an age where you have plans with family and/or friends. She cannot just come in and make you cancel your plans. She has to be more respectful to your time. She wants to feel like she\u2019s important to you and likes to think that you want to drop everything for her but that\u2019s her fantasy, not your reality.", "It should be your choice.", "NTA and you need to tell your dad how you feel about your bio-mom, her lack of effort, her sense of entitlement and lack of understanding your boundaries.", "NTA- Go on vacation. Maybe your bio mom will learn to ask first or give more notice.", "NTA. Ask your dad why his ex\u2019s feelings are more important than his wife\u2019s\u2014not to mention his own child\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t be a mom to you\u2014fine. But she doesn\u2019t get to demand you drop everything with your mom for her new family when she didn\u2019t even raise you. \n\nI hope you and your mom have a great time on your trip!!!! xx", "NTA \n\nIt's bio mom's fault for not checking sooner. If she wants to spend time with you she could call, videochat, or even ask you to come over some other holiday to their place if it's so important for her that you spend time with her family. \n\nYour mom is there for you. Your mom planned that vacation for you two. I say do that, tell bio mom she has to plan better and especially earlier because you won't just run in her arms whenever she decided to show up!", "NTA. They might be your bio parents but you have a mom and dad and can prioritize them since they loved you enough to adopt you and raise you.\n\nContact with the Bio family is up to you and according to YOUR schedule.\n\nTell bio mom that no means no.", "She does not have time for her. She is doing it for her \u201cnew family\u201d clearly!!!", "Edit- she didn\u2019t care about you for a number of years , so why\u2026", "Don\u2019t miss out on the vacation with your mom to spend time with someone who doesn\u2019t respect you or care enough about you to make sure you\u2019re available and willing to visit.", "NTA Obviously I cannot comment on the reasons why your bio mum gave you up and has had minimal contact since. It would be unfair to speculate.\n\nHowever, her nonchalance and fleeting interest in your life now, as well as her high expectations of your availability and criticism of your loyalty is so narcissistic and disrespectful.\n\nYou\u2019ve made plans, you\u2019re excited for them. Please keep them. And don\u2019t feel guilty for doing so xx", "NTA\n\nNnnnope", "NTA\n\nShe asked, you declined.\n\nEnd of the matter.", "NTA, and good for you for knowing what\u2019s right. Your bio mom is disrespectful of your mom, which is a lot of nerve for someone who still treats you as an inconvenience. Go enjoy your planned vacation with your mom - she may \u201cunderstand\u201d if you wanted to change plans, but she would be hurt. Stick with the one who has proven her love - and tell bio mom not to ever call her your step mom ever again.", "NTA.  Go on your trip with your Mom.  How old are you?  I have to admit that I am curious as to you bio mom\u2019s motives here - it seems a little strange that she is all of a sudden deciding to do more than a fly-by visit, and now wants some full-blown second family vacation.", "Tell your bio mom you'd go if she reimburses the money your mom is losing by not going to a vacation she has already paid for. \n\nNTA btw, but yeah, I'd be like your father and tell you to meet your half brothers.", "op=NTA\n\nThose are BIG plans to make without checking with you first.\n\nI think your wishes need to be respected here.", "Go and enjoy. NTA.", "The problem is your bio mum has done insufficient to build a relationship with you. And you are old enough to decide if you are prepared to go running when your bio snaps her fingers. You and your mum have plans. The bio mother expecting you to drop everything  is not reasonable when you have a transient relationship, as evidenced by the fact you have never even met two of your half siblings. NTA Do what you want with the family you want.", "I told my mom last night to tell my dad I don't want to see my bio mom and to stop bringing it up.", "She already has. When OP was 2 years old"]}
