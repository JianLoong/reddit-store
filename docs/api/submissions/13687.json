They were both in college and didn't think they could take care of me so I moved in with my paternal grandparents when I was born. My dad transferred to a school an hour away so even tho I didn't live with him I saw him every weekend and on school breaks. Bio mom just kinda fucked off. When I was almost 2 I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend, now wife. I'll be calling her my mom for the rest of the story. I think I finally met bio mom when I was like 5 or 6, she visits maybe once a year, and we talk like once a month. \n\nNow that I'm older, the way my bio mom's visits go is she gives me a few weeks notice that she's coming to visit, she gets a hotel, someone drops me off to go out to eat or shopping or something with her, picks me up a few hours later, and we do that like 2 or 3 times and call it a day (or year). \n\nSpring break is coming up and my school has 2 weeks off so my mom's gonna take me on a girls trip for the first week and a half. My brothers (8 and 10) have one week so my dad's gonna take them for a guy's thing for the first couple days then they're gonna meet up with me and my mom for a family vacation. I'm really excited for it. \n\nThe problem is my bio mom texted me a few days ago that she, her husband, and their kids are going to be here for the 1st week of my break. I made the mistake of telling her my mom and I will be going on vacation that week. She asked if I can have her move it to the 2nd week and I said no because we'll be on a family vacation then. She said something along the lines of \"great! You can have your stepmom (she refuses to call her my mom) cancel the first week and spend the week with us then you can go on your family vacation\". I told her I'm not going to have my mom cancel our trip and she got upset because her visiting with her husband and kids is a really big deal, I haven't seen them in 4 years and haven't met the younger 2, and she already booked the flights and hotel. I told her my mom also booked the flights and hotel and it's not fair to ask her to cancel it because she couldn't give me more than 2 weeks notice. \n\nShe got my dad involved and he's kinda pushing me to see my bio mom. He keeps saying my mom will understand if I skip the first week and meeting my half siblings is a big deal but I don't really care about them or my bio mom and really want to go on this vacation.", "created_utc": 1680317467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1288y8t/aita_for_not_skipping_or_shortening_a_vacation/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like bio mom did not call to confirm that you would be available before she booked the trip. Your 15 and life is getting busier for you. You have a trip planned with your mom.

Your bio mom should have checked with your parents before making her plans.

The one who doesn't occasionally deign to grace you with her presence, but was there all the time.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your bio mom's behavior in this situation is both childish and self-centered (i.e., giving you only 2 weeks notice, assuming you and your mom would just cancel your pre-planned trip, acting like meeting up with her and your half-siblings is more important than going on a vacation you're excited about). Ultimately, you should do what feels right and what YOU want to do. I think you'd be totally valid for choosing to go on vacation with your mom. I hope you do and I hope you have a wonderful time", "Leaning towards NTA. You're 15, you want to go on a vacation with your mom. I understand that your bio mom really wants to spend time with you but she can't force you into doing something while you already have plans.\n\nWhile I understand your bio mom might be upset, the reason I'm saying it's not N.A.H. is that she should have checked with you way beforehand to see if this was okay with you and communicated with your dad and mom.\n\nI think maybe try and find a common ground with your dad and mom to see maybe if you can free up some other time in the year to meet up with your bio mom but you are under no obligation to change your plans on such short notice", "NTA - Your bio mom should have given way more than just 2 weeks notice. It\u2019s very disrespectful of everyone involved. You\u2019ve already made plans with your mom for a girls trip that you are both excited about. It\u2019s important for girls especially around your age to spend quality time with their mom (btw blood doesn\u2019t make you a mom, being there Does\u2026which it sounds like your mom is there for you) it would be very rude and inconsiderate to cancel those plans even IF she was understanding. I\u2019m very close w/ my mom & stepmom. I hope that you can grow your relationship with your bio mom (& have a strong relationship w/ both) but it shouldn\u2019t be forced on you like this.
