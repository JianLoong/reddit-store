{"id": 13687, "submission_id": "1288y8t", "title": "AITA for not skipping or shortening a vacation with my mom because my bio mom will be in town", "selftext": "So, some background: My bio parents were 19 and 21 when they had me (15f). They were both in college and didn't think they could take care of me so I moved in with my paternal grandparents when I was born. My dad transferred to a school an hour away so even tho I didn't live with him I saw him every weekend and on school breaks. Bio mom just kinda fucked off. When I was almost 2 I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend, now wife. I'll be calling her my mom for the rest of the story. I think I finally met bio mom when I was like 5 or 6, she visits maybe once a year, and we talk like once a month. \n\nNow that I'm older, the way my bio mom's visits go is she gives me a few weeks notice that she's coming to visit, she gets a hotel, someone drops me off to go out to eat or shopping or something with her, picks me up a few hours later, and we do that like 2 or 3 times and call it a day (or year). \n\nSpring break is coming up and my school has 2 weeks off so my mom's gonna take me on a girls trip for the first week and a half. My brothers (8 and 10) have one week so my dad's gonna take them for a guy's thing for the first couple days then they're gonna meet up with me and my mom for a family vacation. I'm really excited for it. \n\nThe problem is my bio mom texted me a few days ago that she, her husband, and their kids are going to be here for the 1st week of my break. I made the mistake of telling her my mom and I will be going on vacation that week. She asked if I can have her move it to the 2nd week and I said no because we'll be on a family vacation then. She said something along the lines of \"great! You can have your stepmom (she refuses to call her my mom) cancel the first week and spend the week with us then you can go on your family vacation\". I told her I'm not going to have my mom cancel our trip and she got upset because her visiting with her husband and kids is a really big deal, I haven't seen them in 4 years and haven't met the younger 2, and she already booked the flights and hotel. I told her my mom also booked the flights and hotel and it's not fair to ask her to cancel it because she couldn't give me more than 2 weeks notice. \n\nShe got my dad involved and he's kinda pushing me to see my bio mom. He keeps saying my mom will understand if I skip the first week and meeting my half siblings is a big deal but I don't really care about them or my bio mom and really want to go on this vacation.", "created_utc": 1680317467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1288y8t/aita_for_not_skipping_or_shortening_a_vacation/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your bio moms poor planning and communication should not fall on you. It\u2019s not your fault she only gave you two weeks notice. And obviously she doesn\u2019t care too much since she hasn\u2019t seen you in 4 years if I understand correctly. She doesn\u2019t get to be in and out of your life at her convenience. Your MOM has been consistent and I don\u2019t care what your father says, I think although she would understand, she would be hurt. I say tell your bio mom it is your decision and she should have given you more notice and asked if you were busy. If you cancel with your mom, your bio mom will think you\u2019re gonna drop everything in the future bc she says so. Please trust me on this.", "NTA, spend time with the people who mean the most to you.", "NTA A lack of planning on your bio mothers part doesn't constitute as an emergency for you. \n\nShe was the one who chose to walk away and not make you a priority now she needs to accept that her actions have consequences and your going on your already booked and much wanted vacation with your mum so bio can either look into rescheduling her vacation or she can Skype you instead, because demanding people cancel their vacation to accommodate her with only 2 weeks notice is extremely disrespectful.\n\nIt's not your fault that you haven't met your younger half siblings your a child and its your bio mothers role to make appropriate arrangement for you to meet them.", "NTA \n\nSpeaking from a situation similar to yours - your bio mom made the choice long ago to be *from the sounds of it* pretty uninvolved in your life outside of when it\u2019s been convenient for her. I\u2019m sure she loves you, and that\u2019s your bio mom, but you aren\u2019t obligated to revolve your life around when she decides to make the effort. \n\n\nMy advice would be (if you haven\u2019t already) to sit down with your dad and tell him that you consider your step-mom to be your real mom and that you want to be with the people you consider close family. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on something you were looking forward to. I hope everything works out how YOU want it to!", "NTA and if I was your mom I\u2019d be hurt if you did that. Bio mom needs to understand the situation. She wasn\u2019t there for you growing up, Mom was. While you can have a relationship and forgive to the extent that forgiving needs to be done, she\u2019s an adult and needs to learn that her feelings need to take a back seat to the situation that was her doing for the sake your comfort and the comfort of your family. Im not saying people should be shamed for their youthful actions their whole lives but fuck all if you\u2019re the one responsible to make her feel good.", "Your whole family has vacation fully planned and booked.  Then bio mom expects you to drop everything on 2 weeks' notice.\r  \n\r  \nEven worse, bio mom is so presumptuous that she has already booked everything before even contacting you.  The entitlement is strong with this one.\r  \n\r  \nShe's crazy to think you'll drop everything else if she decides to visit.  It just doesn't work that way.  You are NTA for not making your life revolve around last-minute bio mom plans.", "NTA she's just your egg donor, not your mom. A mother is someone who raises a child with love and care.", "NTA.\nShe should have spoken with you before she bought the tickets. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate what you do or what plans you have to cancel so she can see you. It\u2019s not your fault for her lack of planning and communication.", "nta\n\ndo what you want", "NTA. Spend the time having a great time with your mom who doesn't just fuck off and skip seeing you for years at a time. If bio mom wants to see you, she needs to plan ahead better. The older you get, the more difficult last minute anything will become and you deserve to have a great time with people who don't treat you like an afterthought.", "NTA. It sounds like bio mom did not call to confirm that you would be available before she booked the trip. Your 15 and life is getting busier for you. You have a trip planned with your mom. The mom who chose you and you chose her. Tell your dad you want to go on the trip with your mom to make memories. You hope to get together with your bio mom and her family in the future, but need your bio mom to plan in advance.", "NTA. Go on your trip! Enjoy it. Maybe next time she will give you a better notice. Don\u2019t let anyone guilt trip you bc of bio mom\u2019s behaviors. Nothing wrong with not wanting to go even if she did ask you earlier. You\u2019re not obligated to see her if you don\u2019t want to.", "I am sorry your parents are putting you in the middle of this situation. Your bio mom should have checked with your parents before making her plans. You are NTA for not wanting to change your plans, but I recommend you talk with your mom and dad together and let them know how you are feeling and see what they think instead of guessing what your mom will think. She sounds like a great mom and will probably be understanding.", "NTA -  tell your biomom you're spending time with the mom who DIDN'T abandon you, and wants to be around you all the time. The one who doesn't occasionally deign to grace you with her presence, but was there all the time.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your bio mom's behavior in this situation is both childish and self-centered (i.e., giving you only 2 weeks notice, assuming you and your mom would just cancel your pre-planned trip, acting like meeting up with her and your half-siblings is more important than going on a vacation you're excited about). Ultimately, you should do what feels right and what YOU want to do. I think you'd be totally valid for choosing to go on vacation with your mom. I hope you do and I hope you have a wonderful time", "Leaning towards NTA. You're 15, you want to go on a vacation with your mom. I understand that your bio mom really wants to spend time with you but she can't force you into doing something while you already have plans.\n\nWhile I understand your bio mom might be upset, the reason I'm saying it's not N.A.H. is that she should have checked with you way beforehand to see if this was okay with you and communicated with your dad and mom.\n\nI think maybe try and find a common ground with your dad and mom to see maybe if you can free up some other time in the year to meet up with your bio mom but you are under no obligation to change your plans on such short notice", "NTA - Your bio mom should have given way more than just 2 weeks notice. It\u2019s very disrespectful of everyone involved. You\u2019ve already made plans with your mom for a girls trip that you are both excited about. It\u2019s important for girls especially around your age to spend quality time with their mom (btw blood doesn\u2019t make you a mom, being there Does\u2026which it sounds like your mom is there for you) it would be very rude and inconsiderate to cancel those plans even IF she was understanding. I\u2019m very close w/ my mom & stepmom. I hope that you can grow your relationship with your bio mom (& have a strong relationship w/ both) but it shouldn\u2019t be forced on you like this. Nor should a child ever be asked to choose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I don\u2019t want to be rude to you or invalidate your maturity but, at 15, you\u2019re too young to be the point of contact for your biological mother to arrange visits. Your biological mother needs to contact your dad (with plenty of notice!) and he and your mom can discuss if that works for you and your family.\n\nI am a parent and I\u2019m sure if you sat your mom and dad down, explained that you feel uncomfortable and pressured by the way things are being organised and ask for your dad to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d and let your biological mother know that HE wants things to be arranged differently going forward then he will.\n\nIt is not unreasonable for your family to request a months notice (or more if it\u2019s going to be during holidays and people are booking flights etc) and that your dad, as your parent, is the point of contact rather than you. \nEnjoy your vacation and please don\u2019t feel guilty \ud83d\ude0a", "I saw her last year.

And even if you were closer which it seems you aren\u2019t and don\u2019t want to cancel; you shouldn\u2019t have to cancel something you are excited for. Then she would be upset you\u2019re not excited to be hanging out with her. She should have given you more notice and ASKED if you were available. The fact that she didn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t punish you and result in you cancelling something you\u2019re excited for not to mention, your mom also paid for tickets and hotels and it would not be fair to her to cancel those things and potentially lose money due to your bio moms poor planning and communication.
