She's in the 6-8 year old ballet class. Last week a little 6 year old joined, Let's call her Abby. Abby is incontinent. Her mom is very vague about it but she said it is due to an illness. \n\nOn Abby's first day, the teacher brought her up in front of the class and explained that their bodies tell them when they have to go to the bathroom but Abby's doesn't so she has to wear a diaper. She told them if Abby has an accident, they are not allowed to laugh at her and they don't need to say anything to her about it. She will go change and join class like normal. \n\nAbby had an accident and apparently my daughter laughed at her when she was leaving the class. Then when they had a water break, the teacher said that my daughter loudly told Abby not to drink anything so she doesn't pee again. \n\nMy daughter was kicked out of class and I was later told by the director of the dance school that bullying is not tolerated and that my options are to have my daughter apologize to Abby in front of the class or we leave and don't get a refund. \n\nI told them my daughter will not be apologizing in front of the class and that she is not a bully but they said if that's the case, we will not be welcome to take classes with them anymore. The other moms in the class side with the studio director and my husband is thinking we should reach out and see if she could rejoin the class if she apologizes because she liked the class. I think making her apologize in front of the class is just to humiliate her and don't want to let her do it but everyone is against me on this one.

Your daughter chose to ignore this warning, and you're refusing to allow her to face those consequences.

Saying your daughter is not a bully is exactly what parents of bullies say. \n\nI'm glad the dance school is taking this seriously. No one deserves to get laughed at for something they can't control. \n\nYour daughter needs to apologize to the class, if she says she's embarrassed, tell her to think about how she made Abby feel about something she had no control over.

So the kids were asked not to bully, laugh and make comments about this girl's incontinence. Your daughter did and was kicked out for it. She can come back if she apologizes.

If you both find it more important to teach your daughter the lesson that it is okay to bully a child with a disability and that it is certainly not a reason to apologize, then you should both face the consequences.\n\nI always made a point of not making apologizing a big deal to my children. If I did anything not nice, either on purpose or without realizing, I would apologize to them. And they also do. Without being asked.

Other parents will not include her in parties & sleepovers.Even family will dread being around her. As an adult, she will get the same. Coworkers, neighbors etc will avoid interacting with her. She will have few friends, if any. She will have no place in society. \n\nIs that the kind of life you want for her?\nDo you want another child to end their life because your daughter bullied them to the point they couldn't take it any more?

Did you get workers comp?", "Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear while writing, it\u2019s 2 am.", "Sounds like a you problem", "Definitely don't read anything on r/Teachers because you actually might die", "My kids' current experience in school with bullying is definitely less shitty than mine was in the 80s and 90s. But I bet it's regional.", "I think it\u2019s both better & worse. A lot of parents remember being bullied or watching others being bullied & how bad it made them feel. Most of them would make their child apologize. But too many parents are a**holes now & are raising their children to be a**holes. I think it began with kids born around the early to mid-1970\u2019s. Too many parents thought that not suppressing their children also meant letting them act however they wanted & that included a lack of civility. Being mean to other kids (& even adults) was just kids expressing themselves.", "Compared to when? One generation ago? Maybe (but I doubt it. Kid peed their pants regardless of reason and more than one kid would be laughing when I was in elementary school. I hate admitting it, but it's true.). 100 years ago? Absolutely not. Victorian area? Not a chance.", "I dare you to tell that to an LGBT person with a straight face", "If the authority figure, in this case the teacher, refuses to interfere and stop the bullying on the victim's behalf, the victim is definitely in their right to beat the shit out of that kid.\n\nDon't like the violence? Then you should have protected the victim. Period.", "If someone is bullying my kid, my kid has EVERY RIGHT to wreck that little fuckers face. I mean, just go ham and make that shit eat his teeth....these bullies want to engage in verbal violence they better be able to back it up. \n\n\"Don't let your mouth write checks your ass can't cash\"", "This is why I\u2019ve told my kids violence and laying hands on another kid is not the answer, unless it\u2019s in self defense. Bc then they are getting themselves in trouble and not the bully.", "Such a dangerous trend. Certain developmental milestones absolutely need to be hit at the time they need to be hit and if you miss.. might never get made.", "That was the issue. The parent expected his kindergarten teacher to do it because he still didn\u2019t know how. Now I won\u2019t criticize the boy for still needing help, I guess everyone learns at their own pace. But the teachers aren\u2019t allowed to do this.", "If I see something I act. Make phone calls home, separate kids in class, etc. But we\u2019re not superheroes and don\u2019t see everything especially outside of class.", "Agreed that it's 100% clear. Ironic that people with low reading comprehension aren't understanding a first grade teacher's post, lol. *braces for downvotes*", "It was 100% clear, lol. I think this person just doesn't understand modern internet phrasing and felt the need to be rude in defense. You see it all the time on here. \ud83e\udee0 Also, you sound like a great teacher!", "I understood it and have cognitive issues because of medication. I read it one time.", "In school you can easily get in trouble even when it's clearly self defense, thanks to \"zero tolerance\" rules", "Thanks! I was combing it over trying to figure out what I could make clearer lol", "And here I thought she was saying she has aneurism because her mind was blown that another parent would be like that  \ud83d\ude02", "What is modern internet phrasing?", "It\u2019s definitely not clear. You have to make assumptions for it to make sense.\n\nAlso, how do you know they are a great teacher?", "Yeah, me too (have read it one time and understood it, not having the cognitive issues. I thought I better clarify that for those who have difficulty with reading comprehension). It\u2019s ridiculous what some people choose to pick up on, smh.", "You were fine.  The only part I had to re-read was this:  \n\n\n> staff tells me so not s\n\nYou're just missing some punctuation there.  \"... staff tells me.   \n So, not sure...\"", "Still have no idea if the boy crying was the fat kid or the bully...,.."]}
