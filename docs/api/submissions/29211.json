She's in the 6-8 year old ballet class. Last week a little 6 year old joined, Let's call her Abby. Abby is incontinent. Her mom is very vague about it but she said it is due to an illness. \n\nOn Abby's first day, the teacher brought her up in front of the class and explained that their bodies tell them when they have to go to the bathroom but Abby's doesn't so she has to wear a diaper. She told them if Abby has an accident, they are not allowed to laugh at her and they don't need to say anything to her about it. She will go change and join class like normal. \n\nAbby had an accident and apparently my daughter laughed at her when she was leaving the class. Then when they had a water break, the teacher said that my daughter loudly told Abby not to drink anything so she doesn't pee again. \n\nMy daughter was kicked out of class and I was later told by the director of the dance school that bullying is not tolerated and that my options are to have my daughter apologize to Abby in front of the class or we leave and don't get a refund. \n\nI told them my daughter will not be apologizing in front of the class and that she is not a bully but they said if that's the case, we will not be welcome to take classes with them anymore. The other moms in the class side with the studio director and my husband is thinking we should reach out and see if she could rejoin the class if she apologizes because she liked the class. I think making her apologize in front of the class is just to humiliate her and don't want to let her do it but everyone is against me on this one.

It was explained to the class along with behavioral expectations. Your daughter ignored the expectations and did exactly what she was told not to do.  I\u2019m glad that they disciplined her swiftly.

Clearly you do not fully understand it or you would not be trying to defend your daughter\u2019s actions.", "YTA, and gosh, I wonder where your daughter has learned to be a bully? (No quotes required around bully, because that\u2019s exactly what she is).", "YTA. Why, exactly, would it be so humiliating to apologize, even if it\u2019s in front of the class? Your daughter embarrassed the girl in front of the class, did she not?", "Your daughter laughed and made mean comments about another child's medical condition after being told not to.

Abby has a disability for Pete sakes, I\u2019m in shock you think it\u2019s ok for your daughter to bully a young girl with a disability.", "YTA. your daughter should apologize in front of people because she needs to learn consequences for bullying and that what she did was hurtful and wrong. she made fun of her in front of everyone, so she can apologize in front of everyone. that seems fair to me. she needs to learn somehow, and laughing at the girl in the first place is much more humiliating than apologizing after the fact imo.", "YTA.  The apple didn't fall far from the tree.", "OP the director is not doing it to humiliate her.  It is to teach her consequences, which you are refusing to do.  She, like the rest of the class, was warned not to humiliate this young girl, Abby, who apparently has a physical illness that she will likely will have a lifetime of issues.  Your daughter chose to ignore this warning, and you're refusing to allow her to face those consequences.  Should she do something worse again, or if someone does something similar to her, then your answer is just to ignore the consequences.  You're not being protective of her, you're just being a coward because you don't want her to possibly hate you for having her face her actions.", "YTA.  Your daughter humiliated a new student, who is 2 years younger, even thought the dance instructor advised everyone what not to do.

Even in this surely watered-down version of events, your daughter was an asshole to a girl with a medical condition, and you are enabling that behavior by failing to hold her accountable. She shouldn't be humiliated for apologizing. She should be humiliated for behaving that way in the first place. I have no doubt where she learned it from, though, so my hopes for her are not that high.", "Guarantee if the roles were reversed you'd be on the warpath lol.

Are you for real? The mental gymnastics required to view your daughter as a victim is unbelievable. She\u2019s 8, not 4. \n\nYou\u2019re not doing either her or you any favors by letting this slide. It will do her good and make her more empathetic.", ">I think making her apologize in front of the class is just to humiliate her and don't want to let her do it but everyone is against me on this one.

As a new mom I\u2019m so scared to send my kid to school because she\u2019ll have to deal with kids like yours. She was told the expectations and decided to do whatever she pleased. That\u2019s not an innocent mistake. YTA.", "YTA - this is how mean girls are made, with parents like you that enable their shitty behaviour. Your daughter was a bully. She humiliated Abby in front of everyone. You refuse to let her be held accountable. You are failing and your daughter will suffer for it.", "Yta.\n\nImagine how Abby's mom feels. She was probably already worried that something lint this would happen. All she wanted was for her daughter to have a good, safe time at dance class and YOUR daughter ruined it for her the first day. She was probably worried the other girls would make fun of her and your daughter proved her right. \n\nYou not holding your daughter accountable for stuff like this is how she becomes a bully later. Saying your daughter is not a bully is exactly what parents of bullies say. \n\nI'm glad the dance school is taking this seriously. No one deserves to get laughed at for something they can't control. \n\nYour daughter needs to apologize to the class, if she says she's embarrassed, tell her to think about how she made Abby feel about something she had no control over. Talk to her about why what she did was wrong. You do think what she did was wrong right? You see that her making fun of another girl for a medical condition she has no control over is mean right?", "Maybe an apology in person would be enough. But i ll go with YTA because at no point you mentioned that this was as option and that you actually tell your daughter that she was in the wrong.", "YTA.   What\u2019s wrong with you?  It\u2019s not humiliating to apologize to the class.  It\u2019s to teach her a life lesson on how to behave and be held accountable.

Your daughter bullied a younger child with a medical condition and you are worried about making her apologise because that would be \u201chumiliating\u201d.

It's not a big deal and letting her off won't help her in life", "YTA. Your daughter should know not to act like that in the first place, but on top of that there was a group discussion about it. Your daughter is a little bully. Why she needed to be told to apologize is beyond me. Why you needed to be told it was necessary and why you think it isn't needed is just ridiculous. Your daughter is going to have a hard life and make other people's lives hard too if you don't figure your shit out.", "Well done for passing on your values to your 8 year-old so completely. Expect her to be chucked out of a lot of extra-curricular activities throughout her childhood. YTA.", "YTA- it\u2019s not humiliating to apologize in front of the class. It\u2019s showing humility for being a little shit gremlin when the teacher literally told them to behave.", "YTA Your daughter may not realize she was being a bully, but she was. As a parent, you need to sit her down and explain why what she did was wrong, and that she should apologize to Abby and never laugh at her again.", "Sorry, I really don't get it. So the kids were asked not to bully, laugh and make comments about this girl's incontinence. Your daughter did and was kicked out for it. She can come back if she apologizes. Why on earth are you against this? And how does your daughter feel about this? If you both find it more important to teach your daughter the lesson that it is okay to bully a child with a disability and that it is certainly not a reason to apologize, then you should both face the consequences.\n\nI always made a point of not making apologizing a big deal to my children. If I did anything not nice, either on purpose or without realizing, I would apologize to them. And they also do. Without being asked. Perhaps your daughter didn't realize that what she said had a certain impact. Perhaps she didn't mean to cause this impact. How difficult is it to just say that she apologizes for causing this impact, that she has talked to people about it and that she now realizes it was very wrong and she apologizes for it?\n\nGrowth is what it is.

Other parents will not include her in parties & sleepovers.Even family will dread being around her. As an adult, she will get the same. Coworkers, neighbors etc will avoid interacting with her. She will have few friends, if any. She will have no place in society. \n\nIs that the kind of life you want for her?\nDo you want another child to end their life because your daughter bullied them to the point they couldn't take it any more?
