We've been friends for like 6 months now. We work together and hang out outside of work every couple weeks with a few mutual friends also from work.\n\nA couple months ago he told me that he started to feel like he rushed into this marriage and that he was still young and not really ready to \"settle down.\" It's tricky because they have a kid together and they each still plan to move to her home country which is also the place that I have been planning to live since before I met him. He broke up with her and has explicitly stated that he is not interested in getting back together with her romantically but they are still close and try to stay friends. To my knowledge she still hopes to stay married to him. The whole situation seems messy because he also has told me that they have slept together since the separation, that she wants another kid, and that she suggests they get marriage counseling. He does not want that.\n\nThe other day I finally met her at a party and it was a lot of fun. We got to speak in her language, which both of us rarely get to do. She was kind, funny, charming, and I just want to know her more, at least as a friend. I'm really terrible at reading signs so I don't know if she was interested in me because I reminded her of her home or if she was into me. I really care to keep my friendship with my boy, so I want to ask him what he would be comfortable with before any feelings might develop.\n\nFrom reading online most people seem to be very touchy about friends and exes but the main concern seems to be that your friend would still have feelings for their ex, which he has made it clear he doesn't. To me it seems kosher if she liked me and he doesn't like her. Why should he interfere in her romantic life if he has moved on? WIBTA if I asked him how he feels about this?

Just because he confirmed that he doesn't want her anymore does not mean you're in the green light. You're convincing yourself. If you pursue this woman or even show ur boy the intention of doing so, your relationship with your friend will never be the same, it will be finished sooner or later.

She is emotionally unavailible and you've only met her once. You pointing out that you both want to move to the same country after talking to her for an eveing is honestly weirding me out a bit. \n\nA lot of comments explain that its a bad idea and an unspoken rule to not date your friends exes, but its also the added logistics here of them having a kid and having to co-parent. Even if you guys did date, there is no way for you to separate your relationship with her and with your friend, because they will be linked for the next 18 years. Say you ask your friend, he says go for it, she is interested, you start to date, everything is fine for a bit.

He wouldn't be giving false information, misdirecting him, or going back on a promise. He just wants to ask the friend, upfront and directly if he can pursue her, which is *incredibly* honest.\n\nPeople keep throwing out words like \"Betrayal, deception, trust.\" But these all imply the existence of something that can't possibly be assumed. It's not a \"betrayal\" unless he previously promised not to pursue her. It's not a \"deception\" if he's not purposefully lying about anything.\n\nI'm starting to think people are just really, *really* insecure about anything that even *encroaches* on traditional monogamy, and for lack of a way to actually justify that feeling, just start throwing out other words with negative connotations regardless of how well they actually apply.", "I don't want to deceive him.

It has nothing to do with ownership or any other absurd buzzwords polyamorous people love to use. For most of us, the love and connection is deep and real enough that we prefer to commit to a single person and pour all of our love and romance there. Over time this love settles, it changes, it deepens, it becomes hard, and then easy again... We still get crushes, we still might fall in lust, but that commitment holds strong. That commitment means everything. Why on earth would I want to split my love and romance between several people? All of my romance goes to my wife and all of my love and energy is for her and my children. Bringing someone else into this picture would be doing my wife and family a disservice. Not to mention it sounds fucking exhausting.\n\nOh and OP - YTA", "\u201cEthically you\u2019re completely fine\u201d hahaha what a clown.

A couple of months ago (2 or 3 months into said friendship) he finds out his friend is having relationship problems. Instead of just being a friend he immediately starts making plans to fuck his wife. \n\nIf you can't understand how that is deceitful and a betrayal, I feel very sorry for anyone in your life that thinks you are a \"friend\". This is not the way friends behave.\n\nIt has nothing to do with monogamy. It has everything to do with being loyal to your friends.", "YTA there are boundaries\u2026. This is one of them wait till you are 30 then you can decide to ask", "You know him for half a year and you\u2019re already trying to fuck his wife. \n\nBuddy what is wrong with you.", "Are you asking why a friend shouldn't bang his friends ex-wife and play step-dad to his kid? Jfc man.", "Fine, do you not realise how destructive and deceitful this is? All you have of any real value in life are the relationships you build, and they're all built on trust.\n\nYou said \"People are touchy about friends and ex's\" and rightfully so, betraying your friend like that is probably one of the worst things you can do to the man; and the fact you don't realise that iinstinctively is alarming.\n\nWithout sounding self-righteous i think you need to work on your moral compass a little.", "hey, I get it. You thought \"what harm would there be in asking?\"the internet said \"prolly lots, bruh\" and then you pulled back.You're a good dude for that. Kudos.  \n\n\nedit  \ngolly gee wilikers, woah those were some brutal comments they sent at you.  \nlike, I get it, I wouldn't have recommended going for it, but hot damn. \"you're disgusting\"? what? that felt way outta line. you didn't know, so you asked. sheeeesh. people suck. I hope this thread didn't get you too down, dude.", "And in the context of dating ex-partners specifically, how is \"commitment\" relevant at all?\n\nThis is why I don't buy the whole romanticized notion of \"commitment.\" Because most people are still jealous and insecure even *after* breaking up with their partner. Even when they've consciously decided to break the commitment by all official channels, they still get uncomfortable seeing their ex with someone else. Because it's all fueled by ego. It's your caveman brain being upset at the idea that a competitor can enjoy something that once belonged to you.\n\nCommitment does exist and is something to value, but I actually see it a lot more in poly relationships. They have to commit to their partners because they aren't forced to stay in line by traditional roles. Monogamy isn't commitment, it's entrapment. You're putting yourself in a position where you have no other options. I wouldn't call a drug addict \"committed\" to sobriety because he's locked in rehab where no drugs are available. Once he's freed and he has access to drugs, but still chooses not to relapse, only then would I say he's \"committed.\" \n\n>Bringing someone else into this picture would be doing my wife and family a disservice.\n\nSo monogamy is good because \"all\" your love goes to your wife. Which, by that logic, means all your familial love has to be split evenly between your children. So if you have only one child, you can love them 100%. But if you have two children, you can only love them each 50%. So it's better to have fewer kids so you maximize the love per child ratio. And by the same token, better to have fewer friends so you can be better friends with each of them. \n\nAs if romantic love is a finite resource to be consciously distributed, but all other emotions aren't. Yeah, I don't buy it for a second. The only difference I see between romantic love and friendship, is that our caveman instincts tell us it's easier to protect one breeding partner from competitors than a whole harem. Which is a line of thinking about 10,000 years out of date.", "That... literally means nothing. You just said two exclusionary statements which, when taken in tandem, is a definition so broad as to literally encompass the entire human experience.", "Nah I only date seriously. I don't bang people. I've only ever been with my husband, and if we broke up I would never care who he slept with after. I would not want to stand in the way of his happiness.\n\nI can't say I'd usually date a friend's ex, but then again, I never even liked one. I've also never been close friends with someone who is insane enough to have breakup sex with the mother of their child, so idk about all that extra nonsense.", "If you can't *explain* how it's deceitful and a betrayal, then I'm starting to think it's because you don't actually have an answer.", "Idk if OP is asking, but I am asking. Is the ex not allowed to date anymore? Is she only allowed to date people the ex doesn't value? How is this supposed to go, according to the careless chump who dumped the mother of his children? Come TF on right now?\n\nOk actually, yeah. Thanks for your comment. I thought about it, and I realized. The new guy, if there ever is one, should not be friends with the ex. Because ex wife doesn't deserve another man who would associate himself with that sort of human. She should grow and leave that old dude behind, at least as much as possible. You right.", "This perspective is just alien to me.\n\nIn what sense is this a \"betrayal?\" That implies an agreement made knowingly. Did I miss a clause in the universal social contract that apparently exists? When did we agree that friends partners are off limits? Why is this just assumed?\n\nI simply can't wrap my head this in a way that doesn't come across as inherently misogynistic. It puts the women in the position of something more akin to a possession. As if by marrying her, she is his property, which makes her \"off limits.\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but if there's another way to interpret it I'm really not seeing it. The whole attitude is so slimy at its core. \"Even though I can't have her, I still don't want other people to have her.\" Like a child calling dibs on his favorite toy, except with a real human being.\n\nFuck that. If you really valued your friendship, you would want your friend to be happy. And if that means he gets with your partner, then you should get over yourself, put aside your ego and admit that she's not yours to claim anymore.", "Dude, honestly, I don't give rats ass if you want to be polyamorous. It doesn't affect me. I was just annoyed by your dumbass \"all monogamous people are stooopid\" remarks, so I decided to be snarky back. You do you, I'll do me,  you do your partner, I'll do my wife, you do a different partner, I'll do my wife, you do yet another partner, and I'll do my fucking wife because that's how I want to live my life. That's how I want to love my wife. And that kind of commitment means something to me. \n\nYou might want to try digging your head out of your ass long enough to understand that your view on how relationships should work isn't some kind of universal truth, no matter how badly your air of superiority reeks.", "Exclusionary statements?  I can\u2019t see how my statement was vague, if that is what you meant. \n\nEthics are defined as a set of moral principles that govern a person\u2019s behaviour. Your suggestion that two consenting adults can do whatever they want contradicts the literal definition of ethics. Ethics govern our behaviour, and therefore, limit us from making decisions deemed to be morally wrong. \n\nMoral principles are defined by a society as a whole and not by a single individual.", "You don't care if your husband sleeps with your best friend weeks after you break up? \n\nYou feel like that friend respects you? \n\nCalling bullshit. It is clear you don't know what you are on about but that isn't surprising because you have only been with one person so you don't actually understand the emotions", "What is wrong with you and OP? Go outside and touch grass", "If you've gone you're entire life up until this point unable to comprehend the idea of basic decency and  respect I doubt very much a random internet stranger is going to help you understand. \n\nI'm starting to think you're just a selfish AH \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well, he's still committed to raising their kid and he was young and made a mistake of getting married. I think \"dumped\" is strong. I agree though that he needs to come to a better understanding as to what their relationship should be and consider how sleeping with her when he knows how she feels might affect that. I think there is no fault in their separation, they just have different goals in life ATM.", "It's not my job the fight off all of the rats that scurry out when it's time to take out the trash.\n\nIf you can't fathom why chasing after your close friends' partners is despicable then I'm not going to spell it out for you.\n\nAlso, you're arguing points that were never even made, and using buzzwords like \"misogyny\" doesn't validate your point either; it has nothing to do with the woman, she's on the market, but friends don't go shopping.\n\nNoone is claiming possession, the issue lies around solidarity, integrity and respect amongst friends. You are right there are no rules, it's just common decency that most people respect.", "It's also worth noting that I talk to my dear friends about more things than sex and relationships. We wouldn't have to talk about a guy all the time just because she starts seeing him, if I didn't want to talk about it.\n\nFurthermore, you don't know my husband at all. Trust me, if I move on, move on. There are no emotions about the past that I could hold onto with him. It's all in or all out. Why do you think I went to the extreme of marrying him?!\n\nNow I will say that, in order to be all out, I'd have to say that it would have to be a monumental fuck up. I almost certainly wouldn't recommend him to a friend after that. But the guy in OP did his own fuck up. I'm sure that comes with its own set of emotions, but that's all on him. He can't expect the people around him to build their lives around his own feelings about his own vow-breaking dick-centered fuck up.", "In your OP you stated this guy basically wants to sleep around, not that he has any issue with his ex wife or anything else going on that she doesn't support fully. Sure sleeping around is a different goal, but it's also a different goal that he vowed not to take on when he got married no matter how young. It's also really not that much of an ask to only sleep with someone who you craved, pursued, slept with, and impregnated. Their shared goal is allegedly raising their son. I'm sorry, but respectfully, the issue here is your friend's dick. Ironically, even as an ex, this woman did a fine job handling said dick! What a wacky situation. Honestly, thank you for sharing. Maybe she's just much too nice. I can't blame her for that as obviously she is also young and they are coparents and she cares for him. But he doesn't deserve it, and it won't last.", "The problem is the rule here doesn't scale.\n\nSmall town everyone knows the husband, suddenly this seemingly reasonable boundary means she can't date anyone in town. What is she supposed to do move? Does her ex now own the entire town?\n\nMaybe you say but that doesn't apply in larger areas but when you narrow the age range to an acceptable band, socio economic status, places they go to meet people, etc for some people even in the biggest towns in the world a high percentage of the people she might want to date are off-limits or already taken.\n\nIn the abstract this seems reasonable enough but when it comes to the specific situations it is quite likely to have significant unforeseen impacts.", "Ew.", "YTA and this ain\u2019t your boy Fr bro", "Stop thinking with your dick.\n\nYwbta, and you should seriously reflect on yourself and how you could possibly think this is okay. Check your morals", "YTA other people exist. Who needs enemies with friends like you", "YTA. Are you on the spectrum?", "YTA\n\nAre you insane?", "YWBTA.  Leave her alone and look for love when you move to the undisclosed country.", "YTA - this was a doozy. Horribly idea my dude. Your close friend\u2019s ex wives should always be off limits", "YTA, you call this guy your friend and you want to hook up with his ex wife that he's probably still divorcing? Not to mention frim what you've written she's still hung up on him. Why would you even..", "I want to encourage you to find a nice lady that isn\u2019t in the huge mess this wonderful woman is in through no fault of her own. You having a connection to the man she still wants to have children with makes her not date material even if you didn\u2019t know her ex. \n\nSave yourself a mountain of pain. \n\nYwbta to yourself.", "It's like he is asking his friend to lend him a toy. Women = property to this guy. It seems not to have entered his mind that she is the one who gets to decide who she wants to sex up.", "He just doesnt get this, though! Its baffling but good the internet can teach him before he blows things up!", "You are going to ask his permission to use her body? Does she have a choice in this, or have you decided women are objects to be lent?", "Everyone going \u201cohhh he won\u2019t be your friend anymore\u201d\n\nInstead of \u201che can\u2019t give permission! She isn\u2019t a cow\u201d", "Honestly what? No one knows how they'd really react to to a situation until they're in it. Also it's not about \"standing in the way of happiness\" or if you're truly over an ex, it's a respect thing. If your friend gets with your ex it's weird and disrespectful regardless of how the relationship ends."]}
