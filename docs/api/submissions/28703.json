In turn, she would handle the household 100%. This is how it\u2019s traditionally handled in her culture. He got upset because he wanted her to pay for 50% of the bills but still handle 100% of the household chores. \n\nThese dudes are living in a fantasy land where they marry a docile bang-maid/nanny who also works full time. \n\nAnyway, NTA.
