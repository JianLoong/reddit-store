Last year, Ken had an idea for a couple\u2019s membership to the gym. I was a bit reluctant at first but now I love it! We go 3-4 times a week while the kids are at preschool/playgroup.

When I was about to leave the house, the twins\u2019 preschool teacher called me and said Ben wasn\u2019t feeling well and someone needed to pick him up. I went to the school. By the time I had taken the twins home and given them snacks & medicine (Jen was feeling ill as well but she never said anything to the teacher), it was time to pick up Ren. When I got home that time, Ken was at home and he looked angry. He waited until after I put the kids for naps and then he said I was dumb and selfish for leaving him waiting at the gym for 20 minutes without calls or other explanation. I do feel bad. He was always excited to go to the gym with me and he didn\u2019t have friends who went at the same time as him, so he must have waited by himself for me to just leave him alone. I could have sent my mom to pick up the kids instead, as she doesn\u2019t work and said she\u2019d babysit whenever. Plus, even if I didn\u2019t do that, I should have let him know I wasn\u2019t coming. But at the same time, the twins were ill and it was all I thought about.

Your 4th child (woops, I mean husband) is very immature to be calling you dumb and selfish for doing your job. If he belittles you like that often, and you believe it, then you might need therapy to figure out that it's wrong.

Is that right?!? \n\nNTA\n\n\nKids come first and taking care of them can be stressful. Yes, ideally you would have called or sent him a text. I also wonder why he was incapable of checking in with his pregnant wife who didn\u2019t show up to their standing date. Are his thumbs broken? He had no reception? No phone and there was not one way he could have checked in with you? He\u2019s a jerk.

What an ah.", "NTA. \n\nI was on the fence til I read:\n\n> He called me dumb and selfish. \n\nNo. Stuff happens when you have small kids. You weren't being selfish (you were taking care of your kids, ffs), or dumb. You were distracted and it was *20 minutes.*\n\nA reasonable response to your (pregnant) wife (and mother / caretaker of your sick kids) would be, *hey, that was a bummer, can you try to text me next time? Oh, and thanks for taking care of them, I know it's stressful*... not name calling.", "Meh-she got busy and he got his feelings hurt. He needs to grow up.", "NTA. You were focused on taking care of the kids. Also, this was a gym workout - not a dinner with reservations and babysitter scheduled, not a movie with a set time. Your husband and other people on this thread need to cut you some slack.", "ESH... But your husband is absolutely an AH. Yes, you should've texted/called. But calling you \"dumb and selfish\" is inexcusable, regardless of the circumstances. However, you did leave him unattended for a whole 20 minutes without his blankie and pacifier. He must've been very frightened.", "NTA\n\nI had 4 under 4 (now 25,25,27,29) any day everything goes according to plan is a really friggin great day. Those are not typical days when you have little kids. Obviously, a quick text would have helped but move on & try again tomorrow!

If he wants to start pointing fingers about someone doing something dumb & selfish he needs to look in a mirror.", "NTA because I liked your fake names.", "ESH - You acknowledge your failure to communicate that you weren't going to make it, but calling your spouse dumb and selfish over a missed gym date? That's an overreaction imho.", "YTA. it's not the working out alone. It's the lack of communication.", "Esh. You should have contacted him.

Was it the first thing on your mind? No probably not, the sick kiddos were. On the contrary you\u2019re husband didn\u2019t care that the kids were sick he called you selfish\u2026 because you were at the spa. You know that germ spa that ends up with kids and parents needing amoxicillin. ( it\u2019s that time of year) That is selfish. If anything he\u2019s the AH not you.

It's 20 minutes and you didn't purposely blow him off.\n\nAlso you're pregnant and have 3 children you're caring for.

Oh dear, how did he survive that?\n\nHe wasn't worried that something had happened to you? He was upset because he had to wait, and then called you names. You aren't upset by the name calling? \n\nYour mom is not responsible for these kids. You and hubby are. It's not her job to go get and take care of sick kids so you can work out. Hubby's needs for companionship at the gym do not come before sick children. \n\nIf he had been super concerned for you, and worried that something had happened to you or your baby, I wouldn't be coming down so hard on him. He wasn't, though. That doesn't alarm you at all??", "NTA.  A good husband does not call his pregnant wife \u201cdumb and selfish\u201d for taking care of their three kids in a minor emergency.

But I refuse to judge you the ass when you husband attacks you with insults rather than a simple conversation. He called you dumb and selfish? That is simply not an acceptable way to talk to someone you love, ever, and certainly not because of a simple miscommunication. NTA.", "NTA, why couldn\u2019t he reach out? You need to decide if you are ok with him talking to you like this", "NTA what was wrong with his phone, does it only receive calls but can\u2019t make any outgoing calls???\n\nYou, his pregnant stay at home wife, was MIA and he never thought to check whether anything happened to you????\n\nHonestly the bar is so low for grown ass men that it might take a deep sea diving robot to locate it because it seems to be in the depths of Mariana trench", "NTA. \n\nThis was a simple mistake, you could have texted him, but these things happen, no big deal.\n\n> then he said I was dumb and selfish for leaving him waiting at the gym for 20 minutes\n\nNo, that's not OK. He's insulting you just because he had to wait 20 minutes while you took care of his kids?!\n\nNope, nope, nope. Ken is an asshole.", "NTA. You were picking up your kids who were sick and couldn\u2019t be left unattended. Yes maybe you should have texted him, but did he ever call or text you? What would have happened if you had gotten hurt and couldn\u2019t text him? I would be more worried if someone said that they\u2019d be there and didn\u2019t turn up after twenty minutes of being late without communication. \n\nYour young kids were sick and I get not having time to text, and I\u2019m not a parent.", "YTA, you couldn\u2019t shoot him a quick text?", "Soft YTA.  I don't think you were \"dumb and selfish\" as he said... more like distracted and inconsiderate.  Yes, you should've called or texted him to let him know what's up but it seems like he's overreacting a bit.", "YTA for not at least sending him \u00e0 text.", "YTA. You were not taking the kids to the ER. You can spare ten seconds of your day to type in a text that says \"Kids are sick, can't come to gym, love you!\"", "Little bit YTA for not calling or texting\n\nHubby's a definite A for getting upset over 20 minutes given the situation", "YTA, not for choosing to pick up your sick children, but for not even sending a quick text to your husband to let him know you wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.", "So you didn't let him know you wouldn't be coming because the kids were sick? Yeah, YTA. If you had plans, and something came up, you let the person you have plans with know. Now, maybe you were just caught up in the chaos of  having to drop everything to go get your kids and it simply didn't occur to you (i know how hard that is with kids), but that doesn't make it right.", "ESH. You definitely should have called. However, I've been pregnant before and also understand how exhausting kids are too. I'd chalk it up to just having a lot going on and forgetting. \n\nYour husband can be a bit annoyed, but it's not really something beyond just saying \"hey, you forgot to call\" and you saying \"oops sorry\". He could have just gone ahead and worked out.", "NTA for being worried about your kids and dealing with that, I would apologize for not calling or texting though and letting him know whats up. Ken should understand that the kids are not well and that was your focus. Most kids want their mommy when unwell and saying your mother should have gone to get them is a little incentive.", "NTA did he text you why you were running late ?", "YTA but only mildly. This is a normal marriage fight. You should have called him while you were on the way to grab the kids. Nobody likes being stood up without a call, even if it's for a good reason.", "ESH-it happens. You made a mistake. You know that. He got mad (which he shouldn\u2019t have). You\u2019re both the AH as far as I\u2019m concerned. He shouldn\u2019t be this self-centered.", "NTA. When your child's well being is on the line it is perfectly valid to foget many things. Its not like you're a bad human. Mama bear took over and thats just a natural instinct. The fact that you still want to be there for EVERYBODY means you have a heart and your husband will understand if he hasn't already.", "YTA", "NTA-\n\nYou've already doing all the primary child duties for three children.  There's no need for you to be babysitting a fourth.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "YTA, sure it wasn\u2019t intentional, but you forgot about your partner.  That\u2019s hurtful, and it would have only taken a second to send a text.  Sick kids are stressful, and if you\u2019re pregnant it doesn\u2019t help with memory.  However, he is still right to feel hurt that you couldn\u2019t spare a second to let him know.  Having kids puts a strain on the best relationships, and it\u2019s important not to neglect your partner (Not that this is what you\u2019re doing, but it creeps up on you).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
