Yeah, YTA. If you had plans, and something came up, you let the person you have plans with know.

You definitely should have called. However, I've been pregnant before and also understand how exhausting kids are too.

He could have just gone ahead and worked out.", "NTA for being worried about your kids and dealing with that, I would apologize for not calling or texting though and letting him know whats up. Ken should understand that the kids are not well and that was your focus.

When your child's well being is on the line it is perfectly valid to foget many things. Its not like you're a bad human. Mama bear took over and thats just a natural instinct. The fact that you still want to be there for EVERYBODY means you have a heart and your husband will understand if he hasn't already.", "YTA", "NTA-\n\nYou've already doing all the primary child duties for three children.  There's no need for you to be babysitting a fourth.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "YTA, sure it wasn\u2019t intentional, but you forgot about your partner.  That\u2019s hurtful, and it would have only taken a second to send a text.  Sick kids are stressful, and if you\u2019re pregnant it doesn\u2019t help with memory.  However, he is still right to feel hurt that you couldn\u2019t spare a second to let him know.  Having kids puts a strain on the best relationships, and it\u2019s important not to neglect your partner (Not that this is what you\u2019re doing, but it creeps up on you).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he can\u2019t be at a gym for 20 minutes on his own, hire a babysitter (for him). He\u2019s the only one that was out of line and I\u2019m sure his poor reaction will make sure you never forget again. \nNTA", "NTA at all. 20 minutes is a pittance of time, it really is that simple. You're a SAHM, and he's working - he perceives his time as more precious than yours perhaps, and that you will be there for him when he wants.

You got distracted.\n\nHe was disappointed and understandably so, but this falls into shit happens and he needs to deal.\n\nBe adults.  Communicate.

I'm dumbfounded by the people in this thread. They're ignoring the fact that OP is taking care of three very young kids. *Perhaps* she had bigger things going on and made a mistake?

In fact, even when I was the only one working we shared childcare responsibilities as well because that's a massive job.\n\nIf you're running around after the kids you might lose track of the time. You might forget to text.\n\nCalling your partner \"selfish\" when they're literally looking after your kids is unacceptable.", "Umm calling your partner dumb and selfish for picking up your sick kids is absolutely AH behavior. Stuff happens, she was 20 minutes late. He's almost a 40 yr old man and can work out by himself.  Not the end of the world.", "Its because people are always taking sides. If someone is more of an AH then the other party be wrong at all. Which is dumb and childlish.", "Its not that hard to send a text when you know that you arent gonna make it.\n\nIts pointless to say that communication goes both ways when she was the one whos cancelling on appointments, shes then supposed to let him know.", "Then ESH \n\nYeah maybe you should\u2019ve called or texted but the same could be said for him. \n\nUnless he didn\u2019t have his phone I don\u2019t see why he didn\u2019t take the initiative to call or text you to see what was going on.\n\nYou two should work on communicating", "It better be chicken nuggies", "Yes, definitely true, she could have just forgot it. Then she should have just said \"sorry, i forgot to let you know that im not coming cause i was busy with kids\".\n\nAnd i did say that he is a major AH for lashing out, im not supporting it for abit. All im saying is that she is also in the wrong while he is more in the wrong here.\n\nIm not getting why people are so black and white here. \"If he is in the wrong then she couldnt be wrong\". Thats not the case, they can be both wrong and good communication means that you should acknowledge when you are also in the wrong and apologise for that.", "Did you actually read what I wrote?\n\nI said he is an asshole. I also said that doesn't negate the fact that she is one also", "She's also taking care of three very young kid. Her forgetting an unimportant event isn't AH worthy. She's a human being capable of mistakes.", "So if your husband is 5 minutes late driving to where you are, you text him, while you think he\u2019s driving, to ask him why he\u2019s 5 minutes late?  I wouldn\u2019t do that to anyone.   I would wait until they were 15 minutes late.  That\u2019s my personal line of when to inquire.  Apparently he waited until she was 20 minutes late.  Similar.  By not texting earlier he\u2019s only guilty of giving her trust that if she said she\u2019s coming she\u2019ll be there and if she isn\u2019t coming she\u2019d let him know and then common courtesy (that she should have given him) to not pester her while she\u2019s trying to get there.\n\nMaybe he loves her and doesn\u2019t want her to text while driving for being a few minutes late.  You must text people all the time as soon as they\u2019re a minute late.  I\u2019m sure they appreciate that.\n\n\u201cAre you still coming??  It\u2019s 8:02.

Yeah I don't see it.", "Well, yes. Texting only takes like 10 seconds, if you arent gonna make it to your planned appointment you should let them know. In what world its just ok to let people wait on you when you can perfectly well just take a second and let them know that you arent coming?", "Yeah, it's called communication and it takes less than one minute. He was waiting for her; she should have sent a quick update about her status and the illness\n\nThat's what couples that can communicate properly do", "Isnt it firstly her job to communicate when she is the one who is changing their appointments?

It happening once because kids are sick doesn't make someone an asshole.\n\nThe asshole part is him calling her dumb and selfish for not communicating when he also didn't communicate.", "Yes, both lack good communication skills and should work on it.", "It most definitely is, he is more of an AH here. Im not saying that.\n\nBut that doesnt take away her responsibility to communicate also.\n\nThey are both wrong.", "Everything you said is why I said ESH is a fair judgement on this post", "Fair enough, but I don't agree that everyone sucks.
