By the time I had taken the twins home and given them snacks & medicine (Jen was feeling ill as well but she never said anything to the teacher), it was time to pick up Ren. When I got home that time, Ken was at home and he looked angry. He waited until after I put the kids for naps and then he said I was dumb and selfish for leaving him waiting at the gym for 20 minutes without calls or other explanation. I do feel bad. He was always excited to go to the gym with me and he didn\u2019t have friends who went at the same time as him, so he must have waited by himself for me to just leave him alone. I could have sent my mom to pick up the kids instead, as she doesn\u2019t work and said she\u2019d babysit whenever.

When your child's well being is on the line it is perfectly valid to foget many things. Its not like you're a bad human. Mama bear took over and thats just a natural instinct.

That\u2019s hurtful, and it would have only taken a second to send a text.  Sick kids are stressful, and if you\u2019re pregnant it doesn\u2019t help with memory.  However, he is still right to feel hurt that you couldn\u2019t spare a second to let him know.

Nobody's perfect, we all make mistakes, you had a lot on your mind, and his reaction was excessive.\n\nYour husband for several reasons. First, for assuming you just stood him up. Apparently his concern wasn't that something might have happened to you, and that maybe he should have called/texted to see if you were ok. Second, for being a grown ass adult who apparently can't work out by himself at the gym. Third, for calling you stupid and selfish for prioritizing your sick children over a workout and the *unpardonable sin* of forgetting to text him.\n\nYou need to have a very serious talk about his attitude and brittle ego.", "So he wasn't worried about you, he was mad? Looks like the age difference tell told the same old story again. NTA", "nta, in a moment like that you won't think to message him cuz your worried about your kids. he should've been more worried that you didn't call (for safety reasons) instead of being upset you didn't meet him at the gym.", "Was he concerned about you? Did he try to call or text you? \n\nIf not then NTA.", "Wait. Why couldn\u2019t OP text or call her husband to tell him what\u2019s up? Why is everyone piling on the husband? OP should have just told him first. YTA.", "NTA. Yes, you should have texted your husband about what was going on and why you wouldn\u2019t be coming to the gym, but it\u2019s understandable how with 2 sick children it would slip your mind. \n\nAlso, he only waited for 20 minutes. (Before what - he called you or decided to go home instead?) It\u2019s not that big of a deal. Unless this is a constant issue of you running late or forgetting to keep him updated on changes in plans, it sounds like he\u2019s blowing things way out of proportion.", "NTA - you both own cell phones capable of sending text messages.  You were actually on a mission.  He was standing in the gym lobby with his thumb up his ass.  If you're dumb and selfish, what does that make him?", "Do you guys normally communicate via passive aggressive comments and post problem discussions? I definitely understand why husband would be annoyed. If my wife was meant to show up somewhere to meet me and I hadn\u2019t heard from her for half an hour I would be frantically calling her to make sure she\u2019s ok because my shitty anxiety always has my head jump to the worst conclusion. My wife knows this though because I\u2019ve communicated my needs with her. That being said, calling you dumb and selfish for being overwhelmed is childish too. Everyone makes mistakes, in this case both of you were in the wrong. But not for your feelings, for your reactions.\nEsh", "YTA - you could have called or texted him. You didn't even apologize when you saw him the second time you came home. Not cool\n\nEdit: he should not name call though.", "Dumb and selfish? Your husband\u2019s an asshole for this alone.\n\nNTA.", "Phones work both ways. If he was waiting on you with the expectation that you would be arriving soon, did he not have even a sliver of worry, and think to call or text you to check in on you when you didn\u2019t arrive?\n\nNTA", "NTA op but your husband is, I strongly recommend therapy for the guy cause something is seriously wrong when a grown ass adult insults their pregnant spouse without even checking on them first. Especially when you have 3 other kids.", "YTA.  All it required was a call or text to let hubs know what was going on. Basic common courtesy", "I was going to go with YTA until I read how he called you dumb and selfish for not calling\u2026 I hope he doesn\u2019t talk to you like that in front of the kids, idk why you\u2019d stay with him when he says such negative crap", "Surprise, you already have a fourth child and it\u2019s your husband. NTA.", "yeah you should have let him know you weren't coming but he shouldn't make THAT big a deal of it", "And he certainly could have called you to make sure that everyone was ok. He\u2019s a self centered man.  Should there be a free moment in the day for mother of three, I would suggest marriage counseling.", "ESH. \n\nYou could have shot him a text, as you said. Things with kids happen, sure, but just sending a text isn\u2019t that time consuming. \n\nHe sucks because he called you names. Being upset about it I understand, but calling some one \u201cdumb and selfish\u201d is just way too much. He might have been worried about you when you didn\u2019t show up and exploded because of that, but that\u2019s no excuse.", "Esh\n\nYou could have sent a text at least. And once he learned why you left he should have immediately been understanding. Plus he could have sent you a text for a heads up. What ever the case - 20 minutes is not long to wait.", "NTA\n\nIf he was worried he could have called you. It sounds like you had your hands full with the logistics of 2 sick children, 1 healthy kid and the one you're pregnant with.\n\nCalling you names instead of calling your phone and asking what's up (and if you need help maybe) is seriously inexcusable...", "INFO: Does his phone not dial out?", "Phones work in both directions.\nHis first thought should have been for your well being. Had he called and found out what was happening then his first thought should be about the kids.\n\nInstead, even with all the info, his first thought is about ... himself.\n\nNTA.", "Very soft YTA. You really should have sent him a text to let him know what was going on. Everyone forgets something at some time, so he really should just chalk it up to \"a moment\" and let it go.", "You literally could have spared thirty seconds to text your husband, but his response was way over the top.", "Didn't he have a phone that he could have used to call her to ask what's up? He wasn't concerned for her, just angry and stewing for 20 whole minutes.", "Her not texting was rude and thoughtless, and yeah she's in the wrong and should basically say \"omg, I totally blew it, I'm sorry you sat around waiting for me\" and then be done with it.  It doesn't make her an asshole, it means she made a mistake that caused someone else a minor inconvenience and she needs to apologize.\n\nHis reaction, though, sounds over the top.  I'm voting NTA.", "For some people there kinda isn\u2019t. The progression can go:\n\n1. Where are you I\u2019m worried about you?\n2. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m worried about you\n3. Feeling scared makes me feel weak\n4. I hate feeling weak\n5. I feel weak because of your actions (ignoring that it\u2019s a childish reaction to those actions and not an inevitable consequence of them)\n6. Why did you make me feel weak? You\u2019re selfish to not consider how this makes me hate how I feel\n\nAs I said multiple times this is childish and unhealthy behavior. But it does happen for some people and can explain how \u201cwhere were you I was worried about you\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re dumb and selfish\u201d can coexist for some (immature and assholey) people.", "I think it's reasonable to have gotten distracted by one of your kids being ill, too. Like, that's a high priority concern that can knock other things out of your head, you know?", "No.. \n\n\nI mean he sounds like an asshole and I personally wouldn't like namecalling in a fight; But to call that verbally abusive is a bit much. \n\n\n\nAlso, going from \"He's verbally abusive\" to \"He forces her to be pregnant\" is a pretty big leap.", "NTA- your husband is being childish.", "NTA. If it would have been another reason but kids you worry", "NTA. when your kids are sick you are not prioritizing calling hubby at the gym. You could have called Mom, but didn\u2019t - you likely would want yo watch the sick child yourself. \n\nIs your Husband older that your toddlers? Because his selfish  meltdown is very toddler-ish.", "NTA - yes, you should've texted your husband, but jiminy, he's such a huge AH for name-calling. Is he 12? If not, he needs to grow up.", "YTA, for not bothering to let him know that plans had changed!", "NTA, he is for not trying to contact you though. I would have been very worried about my wife and would of called or texted.\n\nTime to have a heart to heart and let him know under no circumstances will you put up with being blamed for being selfish when your taking care of the sick kids.", "ESH\n\nYou should have told him. He overreacted.\n\nApologise to each other and enjoy your next trip to the gym.", "NTA OP! You\u2019re pregnant with kid #4 and taking care of 3 kids who are sick. Could you have sent a call or text to your husband about the situation? Yes. My question is why didn\u2019t your husband call or text you asking if everything is okay after waiting 20 minutes. Communication is a two way street, and he\u2019s at fault for not trying to get in touch with you. I am also a little concerned about his seemingly lack of care about the health and well being of his children. Most sane parents (because that\u2019s what he is) would understand the situation and would do what they can to help out. Is the caring and raising of the children left solely on your shoulders?", "NTA.\n\nYou went to pick up two sick kids... and he's upset that you forgot to call him right away? JFC he's an AH. His concern seems to be only about him - and not about the children you have together who are currently ill.", "So when kids get sick and you have to pick them up from school, it\u2019s kinda an unplanned emergency right? Tell him to chill the F out. Things come up with kids. Should you have been texting and driving? Of course yes you could have called him. But you say hey I\u2019m so sorry the kids got sick and I was busy with them and you both move on your merry way. NTA but in this situation your husband is totally being an AH.", "ESH because while you should never stand anybody up, how immature and codependent is your husband that he has to call you names over something so silly? Calling someone dumb over something so stupid is next level. Codependent because he can\u2019t enjoy an hour or two at the gym by himself, he HAS to have friends or you by his side? \n\nAlso, irrelevant, but how did Ren(!?) make the cut of fake baby names lol", "NTA\nThings happen and the kids come first. \nYour husband was way put of line calling you dumb and selfish. What is his deal ? Can he not workout without holding your hand ?\n\nHe should've been more concerned that you didn't turn up, I know I would be if my partner just didn't show with no explanation. \nI get it I've been there I have 3 kids I forget or get sooo distracted. Did he try contact you ?\nLack of communication happens, no need for him to be such a enormous dick about it though.", "ESH\n\nThey're his kids, too, you didn't think to tell their father what was happening? Especially since you'd arranged to meet him?\n\nThis said, why didn't he - a grown man who has had 3 kids with you - not call when you didn't show? \n\nThere's so much wrong on all accounts, here.", "Exactly! \nHow was he not concerned. Who's really the selfish one here", "I mean, if his cell phone plan only allows for incoming calls and texts it makes perfect sense why he\u2019d be super pissed\u2026 \ud83e\udd23", "How was your husband at the gym alone? My gym requires all children to be supervised.", "It literally takes 2 seconds to text and you can do it while you're walking LMAO. Also letting the husband know would give her help with the kids.

I finally realized .... I didn\u2019t text my husband when our kids were little. My husband & I are old. Our youngest are 25 (twins). I think our oldest was like 9 before I regularly carried a phone. I had a cell phone for years that sat in my kitchen drawer. Occasionally, when my husband reminded me, I took it with me. Otherwise, we used a real landline phone to call each other. So I wasn\u2019t calling anyone until I got home & I certainly wasn\u2019t calling a gym to find my husband. He was on his own at the gym. He\u2019s fine.\n\nETA \u2014 and not for nothing the phones we had then would\u2019ve taken 15 minutes to text anyone. Had to press every number like 5 times to get a letter. Lol.
