Stay safe and hope your brother is feeling safer and is calming down.\n\nBiggest thing I would do is look up jurisdiction law in your state or county (if you are in the US) for minors choosing to move out of the parental home and into a different family members home.", "Okay. I work in child protection. This type of situation varies from state to state and even county to county in the US. Not sure if this is where you and your brother are, but if so, here\u2019s some general advice. \n\nAs others have said, document the injuries immediately. After 2 days things should already be healing. Get clear documentation, photographs with some kind of measuring instrument to show the size of any marks. Write out each mark/injury and be as descriptive as possible with what it is, where it is, the size and shape it is, etc. You\u2019re going to have to get the authorities involved. At 16, you can\u2019t obtain medical care for him or enroll him in school. You have to obtain guardianship or custody of him. \n\nI would go to the courthouse with your brother and file for an emergency order of protection against your parents. You, as the adult, have to get it on behalf of your brother, the minor. But he will have to describe to the judge what happened and he will need to specifically say he is afraid of them. Hopefully the judge will grant it. There should be domestic violence advocates at the courthouse who can assist with the process. \n\nAfter that, go directly to the police station that has jurisdiction for your parents home and make a police report. Give them whatever evidence you have, show them photographs you took, any text messages, etc. Ask them if they are going to make a report to CPS. If so, just be sure they have your contact info and wait for someone to show up. If not, you might consider making a report yourself to see if they can assist you with the legal process. In my state we can help family members with obtaining legal guardianship of kids. However, there are some states that will not even accept reports on teens so I don\u2019t know what you should expect. \n\nGood luck to you both. You\u2019re a good brother; he\u2019s lucky to have you.", "The best solution would be for him to have someplace else to stay so that you could say that you know where his is and he is fine.  That way even if they show up at your door, he is safe.\n\nOtherwise this takes some mediation to get them back together.\n\nNTA for a couple days then you need to tell them he is fine.", "NTA. They weren't concerned while they kicked him out.\n\nI agree with the comments about checking laws in the area, possibly lawyer up to become your brothers legal guardian if needed.", "NTA, but you should talk to your brother about it. If he says it's OK to tell them, then you can do so with a clear conscience. \n\nI agree with others about finding out what the legal issues might be. If your parents physically hurt him, and since they kicked him out, maybe he can get emancipated? In the U.S. there are usually resources to help young people in his situation.", "ESH, you a tiny bit.  The parents a great deal.\n\nYes, I would tell the parents I have heard from him and know he is safe.  When he next reaches out to me, is there a message you would like me to send?  I wouldn\u2019t disclose locations and I would speak with your brother before doing that.\n\nEDIT:  Subsequent post from OP indicated the brother was physically harmed.  That changed my answer to NTA.  But, document all injuries and immediately consult an attorney.", "I\u2019m not going to call you TA, but you could have at least told them \u201cYes I do, and he\u2019s safe\u2026and maybe thrown in\u2026shame on both of you for kicking him out!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a good Sister.", "I\u2019m not going to say Y T A,  but you really should tell them he is safe.

OP mentioned in a comment that physical harm occurred. That changes everything.\n\nBut dayum, I'm getting tired of rendering a comment based on the original post, only to have to come back and clean things up when OP returns later and says, \"Oh, yeah, I forgot to say ...\" and then makes my original verdict ridiculously insane.", "YTA but let\u2019s me explain. What you\u2019re doing is illegal but I understand why and I have a huge heart for you supporting him. You need to at least tell your parents that you know he\u2019s safe.

You could be in legal trouble, and what he needs to be protected\u2026..FAST.", "NTA but encourage your little brother to let them know he is safe and to not call the police.  Your parents were A Hs and really f\u2019d up, but it is true they are probably panicking.\n\nEdit:  New information was revealed by OP that parents had harmed little brother.  I added a second comment encouraging OP to document the injuries and learn the pros and cons of filing a police report.", "ESH. Your parents suck for obvious reasons, but I do think you need to tell them he\u2019s with you and that he\u2019s safe. Let them know that your brother is going to be staying with you for a while but he is safe. If they don\u2019t know where he is, they may show up at the Boyfriends house, which could potentially out the boy friend or cause the boyfriend/his family a great deal of stress.

Sparing the obvious that you're not homophobic, you lied to your parents on instinct for your brother's safety. \n\nHowever, as many people have pointed out you should look up the laws in your area. If your brother is a minor like you said then you should look up on how you should go about fighting your parents in court for their cruel actions and for custody of your brother. Since your brother is not a runaway you should be in the clear for concealing his whereabouts to your parents but I'd double check that.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to reevaluate her thinking here. I don't wanna jump the gun and say she's enabling your parents but perhaps scared that you're teetering with the law (honestly I doubt you are.) Remind her that your parents kicked him out. They aren't worried about his safety. They must've realized how badly they've screwed themselves up over kicking out a minor and want to know where he is so they can get him before the cops find out.

And you provided that for him.\n\nWhy not call your parents and just ask what it is they're so worried  about? Tell them he is safe with you. They must be worried sick, thinking all sort of things, including him somewhere in a hospital or something.\n\nNothing indicates that they love him less after this revelation, so please call them ok?", "You are in TA.

I don't understand how parents can be this way.", "strongly agreed \n\ncontacting police in your town and the town of origin would probably be a good place to start.\n\nedit: I stand corrected. I hadn't considered the fact that your brother is a minor and police would return him to your parents. I was thinking it saves them potential hassle as a missing person", "The r/legaladvice subreddit is actually pretty horrible for giving any semblance of actual law advice from what I've heard. Get a real lawyer, don't waste time on that subreddit", "I also suggest the It Gets Better Project. Both of those orgs may help.", "OP said in a comment that his brother was physically hurt by the parents when he showed up.", "They were willing to kick out their child in the middle of Winter.  If all they ever have to do is question whether he's okay for the rest of their lives, they're getting off _easy_.", "Do not call the cops! What you need is a lawyer. There are often lgbt organizations in cities that might be able to offer support and may have legal resources to help. I really want to emphasize that in the situation the police will likely just return the child to bigoted parents or get child protective services involved (something else you don\u2019t want without council, your brother could be placed in another unsafe environment). Once you already have council they can contact the police with you and advocate for your brother.", "Definitely not, talk to a lawyer OP if you can.", "Runaway/kicked out...it doesn't matter. It's whoever they believe, the parents or their son", "Yeah go ahead and turn your lil brother in,  then your parents can send your little brother to conversion therapy camp and turn him into a straight person.\n\nBe the big brother he needs and keep your mouth shut.", "That's just not realistic, unfortunately. Coming forward and saying \"They kicked my brother out for bigoted reasons and he would like to stay here until he is of age as he feels unsafe.\" keeps OP from legal problems so he can be the brother his brother really needs- one not in prison.", "The cops are going to go straight to his house if parents do a missing persons report and theres possible liability depending where op lives", "It could be that dad hurt him and kicked him out and mom is looking for him, I don\u2019t know, but maybe"]}
