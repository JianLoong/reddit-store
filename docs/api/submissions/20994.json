I say gaslighted because at no point do you express shock that she would have that opinion. \n\n25/22 is an age difference not even worthy of comment.

Why would your sister say he's too old?  Weird.\n\nSecond, you are spot on to select your best friend as your MoH, theoretically.

I utterly adore him and feel incredibly lucky. We found each other on tinder and to my surprise, it worked- by that I mean it wasn\u2019t just a one night stand.

But I do think your sister is jealous because she has lost \"your sisterly bond\" \u2014 you're closer to your BF than to her.  (For good reason, it would seem).   You see him most days, you do lots together, you have similar interests, he knows you better than she does & gently pushes you as a result.  (He sounds wonderful, BTW.)   \n\nBut she sounds as if she might not currently have a partner & also that she minds about that.  Perhaps you provided all the emotional intimacy she needed\u2014and now, you don't.\n\nFor sure she is silly and saying stupid things, but if you have the time and inclination, maybe see if you can carve out a night every so often that's just you and her.  A sisterly bond's a great thing if you're both on the same page.", "NTA \nIf you're both above 20, a 3 year age gap isn't a big deal.", "NTA.  Does your sister not have a boyfriend?  This might be a bit of jealousy since you got someone close to her age and therefore dipped into her dating pool.  It might not be a matter of not liking him, but actually *liking* him.   As for the wedding musings, it'll be your wedding and the MOH will be whoever actually stands with you, fully backing your happiness.  Right now, sis is not doing that.", "nta", "NTA. Your sister is jealous.", "She says it because his brain has fully developed and mine hasn\u2019t. She also just\u2026 doesn\u2019t like him. Still trying to figure that out though", "Completely agree. If OP was 15 or if BF was 55 then the sister would have point, but 22 & 25 is nothing. \n\nAlso, mom & sister are both sh*tbags based on the MOH conversation. OP should pick whomever they want as their MOH.", "I cant see any way to argue that its not fine. The 'omg age difference' posts dont usually pan out like this.", "Not my first serious bf but I\u2019ve made questionable decisions in the past. Two of my past bf have been physically, emotionally and sexually abusive. I\u2019ve been in therapy and feel much better about everything but she thinks my judgement is flawed because of my past", "This is my friends theory- however my sister is a lesbian so it\u2019s quite a slim possibility", "I used to argue back and give her examples of how she was wrong. But sadly that gave her more ammo to hate him. When she said he didn\u2019t do enough for me I told her that he started cooking more for me because he makes amazing food but she turned it going to, he\u2019s stopping you doing something you love (I enjoy cooking and we share the task). I stopped arguing because I realised there was no point. But I always defend my partner when she says things to him", "Initially in our relationship she didn\u2019t have a partner but now she does- I keep hoping this intimacy will help our relationship.

I\u2019d love a healthy sisterly bond with her", "She has gf but I don\u2019t know if she is jealous that I had a serious relationship before her", "Fuck that stupid bullshit. Even assuming that appalling cliche is true, which is at best debatable and at worst, insultingly simplistic nonsense, then it is entirely possible that your brain is 'fully developed' and his isnt. 25 is an average, as it must be. And it is worth pointing out that the brain does not stop developing.\n\nDoes she think the brain gets a memo on the day of your 25th birthday to say 'you can turn on executive function now'. What utter bullshit.\n\nConsider this: Your bfs birthday is on 2/2 and he was born at midday. Does his brain get 'fully developed' when the date rolls over to 2/2 on his 25th birthday at midnight, or at midday?\n\nBut really the issue is not when the brain is 'fully developed', but rather what the consequences of this are. Is every 18 year old less able to make such decisions than a 25 year old without exception?\n\nShe is apparently hating him based on something she read on the back of a cereal packet or something she overheard the grown-ups say.\n\nAsk her if she has actually read the research on this. I have. There is a grain of truth in it, but no more. Call her out.\n\nTbh it sounds more like there is some kind of jealousy going on here.", "sounds like her brain hasn't fully developed", "That whole \u201c18 year olds don\u2019t have working brains\u201d is a highly politicised interpretation of pop science, mostly being pushed by left-Puritans and conservatives looking for excuses to raise the voting age. It\u2019s junk. \n\nYour sister is cloaking a need to control your life under concern for you. NTA", "Look, your BF sounds ok based on what you've written.\n\nHowever, your sister and parents are off. They smell like 9 day old fish.\n\nShe's making a mountain out of a molehill on a small age difference (the difference between 25 and 22 is very different than 19 and 16, for example). She deliberately lies and tries to cause your family to not like your BF. You admit that she can be cruel. Your sister does not sound like a good person.\n\nYour parents are dismissing your wants and putting your sister's feelings over yours in a hypothetical wedding. Is your parents already convinced by your sister that your BF is bad news?", "(Sorry, this is a bit of a long one)\n\nLook, it sounds like your sister wants to baby you forever and \"\"protect\"\" you. But you're going to therapy and you're working on your choices. How will you get better at making good choices if you aren't allowed to make the choices yourself? Isn't that part of the point of the therapy? Not only to build healthy coping mechanisms for and dealing with the trauma you went through, but to learn/relearn how to trust yourself and make better choices moving forward? Your judgement may have been flawed at one point, but you're working on it! You've probably built up the skills and are making great choices! What does your sister expect you to do? Never trust yourself again and just default to her? Your sister can't decide everything for you, and also what's best for her won't be best for you. So how can she just suddenly decide she's the all knowing decider of good choices?? Sorry, the idea that someone else is better of making choices for you really grinds my gears, even if you made mistakes in the past.\n\nAlso, NTA. \n\nAs others have pointed out, the 22/25 age gap isn't a problem. It would be concerning if you were 16 or say fresh 18 and he was 25, but at 22 and 25 I really don't think it's concerning. Especially since you would both be, hypothetically, in the same life stage. Idk your life, but typically, most people are done with university and working full time by 22 (in an ideal world ofc). As such, a 22 year old and 25 year old would be on a similar life path, both working full time and supporting themselves (again, in an ideal world of course, shit happens). But it's not like one of you is in high school and the other is pushing 50??\n\nIdk, just seems like your sister has a twisted sense of what's counts as being protective, or there is something else going on and she's using this as a cover up.", "Another theory \u2014 she is incredibly jealous that you are well-partnered first?", "Did you had another boyfriend before?did she act the same?", "INFO: Did you sister like any of your past partners? I don\u2019t want to stereotype (my lesbian friends will hate me), but my theory is just your sister was going to dislike any man who\u2019s with her sister. Because 22/25 is trivial age difference; to frame a guy as a predator for that borders on misandry.", "She\u2019s jealous that you\u2019re in a happy healthy relationship while all she has is her shit talking to keep her company.", "Yep that confirmed it for me completely. There is no way you could be even a asshole. You support your guy the same way he supports you. This was a losing battle and she is just going to turn everything against him. I know Reddit is super quick to saying go no contact, but that\u2019s so hard since it\u2019s family. I\u2019d try to have an honest talk and let her know that her comments are not only abusive to your bf, but also you. If she doesn\u2019t respect that it might be time to consider if she\u2019s someone who deserves to be in your life. \n\nI hope that you and your bf stay healthy and happy together.", "My bad for the assumption about who she may be dating gender-wise.  Yeah, being more serious might be the issue considering the age between you two.  It's not a big difference, but usually, the older sibling experiences things first, and if you've already found someone who you are serious about she could be worried you are not getting enough experience or a tad jealous that you may already have found someone of marriage material.  Hopefully, she comes around.", "Thank you so much! I really needed some reassurance that I wasn\u2019t mad for thinking she was wrong. Probably is just an excuse she\u2019s rolling with but thank you!!!", "That is super interesting to me. Is that where this comes from? Because it makes as much sense as the story of the nativity on the face of it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for that. It makes a little more sense to me now. I looked into the so called 'science' but not where it came from.\n\nRegardless, I shall start looking into where this obvious bullshit actually came from.\n\nThanks again.", "Luckily not fully. My mum isn\u2019t overly keen because she does trust my sister but my dad really likes him and is super supportive", "Thank you! I have been putting the work in although I still have a long way to go! I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come but I think you\u2019re right. My sister will always see me as a baby. \nIn fact, my mum uses that as a reason why I should forgive her because \u201cI\u2019m her little sister\u201d\nI just wish there was a kinder way of setting boundaries, or at least keeping a positive relationship", "Or could she have known him in high school or something and have leftover resentment from a feud from back then she doesn\u2019t want to share, because he is closer to her age than yours?", "No she\u2019s never acted this way- she is justifying the change saying I\u2019ve made bad past decisions but she\u2019s never been so openly vocal. It\u2019s to the point where she is even rude to my partners face", "So she loved one of them- a high school bf, one year older. She still goes on about how lovely he was and tbh he was a sweetheart, just not right for me. The rest of them she was indifferent to. \nHowever, she has said to me before that I should just date women (I am queer so this could have happened) so it might be that she feels I\u2019ve chosen wrong? But my attraction is massively based on personality so it\u2019s nothing to do with gender identity", "She's probably jealous.", "I am totally buying into the excuse theory. I wonder what her real problem is? It all sounds rather odd.\n\nAnyway, I hope you can find a way to resolve this and wish you all the best.", "My parents are four years apart. I honestly don\u2019t even really see that as like that much of a gap. My first serious relationship was with an 11 year ago gap.", "She wouldn\u2019t have known him in high school as we grew up on different sides of the country. But it\u2019s possible she was upset I found someone at my age that I\u2019m so happy with", "Well, the point stands that you arent the asshole. Protect yours and your bf mental health and dont tell her anything about him and you", "OP THIS IS HUGE. It honestly might be homophobia/biphobia?? I know you said you\u2019re queer but I know with my friends that are bisexual and see their friends who are queer/bi, dating men.. they get really upset and demeaning to their relationship and partner. Maybe try exploring that possibility? I\u2019m pan and some people in the community (hate to stereotype but gay/lesbian) can be homophobic to people who are open to dating different genders and such!! NTA. I\u2019m sorry this is happening :(", "Ah.  Now I get it because the calling him old thing when there is only a 3 year age difference, AND you're both in your 20s so adults, had me completely baffled.  It's not the age that's the problem, it's the gender, but she won't admit that be ause than she will be seen for what she is, biphobic (I think is the right term) which is, in my opinion just as bad as homophobia.  From the sound of it you are pansexual which is attraction to personality instead of gender.  Ignore your sister, and her phobia.  Be happy.", "Tbh thats what Im thinking too. But what of is unclear.", "I hadn\u2019t thought of this! This might actually be a way to approach the conversation with her, about her expectations from my relationships. Thank you!", "Yes of course. Obviously I hope that\u2019s not the case but if it is, at least you can both come (hopefully) to a consensus and understanding. Good luck!! :)"]}
