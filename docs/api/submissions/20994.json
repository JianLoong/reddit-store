You see him most days, you do lots together, you have similar interests, he knows you better than she does & gently pushes you as a result.

Even assuming that appalling cliche is true, which is at best debatable and at worst, insultingly simplistic nonsense, then it is entirely possible that your brain is 'fully developed' and his isnt. 25 is an average, as it must be. And it is worth pointing out that the brain does not stop developing.\n\nDoes she think the brain gets a memo on the day of your 25th birthday to say 'you can turn on executive function now'. What utter bullshit.\n\nConsider this: Your bfs birthday is on 2/2 and he was born at midday. Does his brain get 'fully developed' when the date rolls over to 2/2 on his 25th birthday at midnight, or at midday?\n\nBut really the issue is not when the brain is 'fully developed', but rather what the consequences of this are. Is every 18 year old less able to make such decisions than a 25 year old without exception?\n\nShe is apparently hating him based on something she read on the back of a cereal packet or something she overheard the grown-ups say.\n\nAsk her if she has actually read the research on this. I have. There is a grain of truth in it, but no more.

NTA", "Look, your BF sounds ok based on what you've written.\n\nHowever, your sister and parents are off. They smell like 9 day old fish.\n\nShe's making a mountain out of a molehill on a small age difference (the difference between 25 and 22 is very different than 19 and 16, for example). She deliberately lies and tries to cause your family to not like your BF. You admit that she can be cruel. Your sister does not sound like a good person.\n\nYour parents are dismissing your wants and putting your sister's feelings over yours in a hypothetical wedding. Is your parents already convinced by your sister that your BF is bad news?", "(Sorry, this is a bit of a long one)\n\nLook, it sounds like your sister wants to baby you forever and \"\"protect\"\" you. But you're going to therapy and you're working on your choices. How will you get better at making good choices if you aren't allowed to make the choices yourself? Isn't that part of the point of the therapy? Not only to build healthy coping mechanisms for and dealing with the trauma you went through, but to learn/relearn how to trust yourself and make better choices moving forward? Your judgement may have been flawed at one point, but you're working on it! You've probably built up the skills and are making great choices! What does your sister expect you to do? Never trust yourself again and just default to her? Your sister can't decide everything for you, and also what's best for her won't be best for you. So how can she just suddenly decide she's the all knowing decider of good choices?? Sorry, the idea that someone else is better of making choices for you really grinds my gears, even if you made mistakes in the past.\n\nAlso, NTA. \n\nAs others have pointed out, the 22/25 age gap isn't a problem. It would be concerning if you were 16 or say fresh 18 and he was 25, but at 22 and 25 I really don't think it's concerning. Especially since you would both be, hypothetically, in the same life stage. Idk your life, but typically, most people are done with university and working full time by 22 (in an ideal world ofc). As such, a 22 year old and 25 year old would be on a similar life path, both working full time and supporting themselves (again, in an ideal world of course, shit happens). But it's not like one of you is in high school and the other is pushing 50??\n\nIdk, just seems like your sister has a twisted sense of what's counts as being protective, or there is something else going on and she's using this as a cover up.", "Another theory \u2014 she is incredibly jealous that you are well-partnered first?", "Did you had another boyfriend before?did she act the same?", "INFO: Did you sister like any of your past partners? I don\u2019t want to stereotype (my lesbian friends will hate me), but my theory is just your sister was going to dislike any man who\u2019s with her sister. Because 22/25 is trivial age difference; to frame a guy as a predator for that borders on misandry.", "She\u2019s jealous that you\u2019re in a happy healthy relationship while all she has is her shit talking to keep her company.", "Yep that confirmed it for me completely. There is no way you could be even a asshole. You support your guy the same way he supports you. This was a losing battle and she is just going to turn everything against him. I know Reddit is super quick to saying go no contact, but that\u2019s so hard since it\u2019s family. I\u2019d try to have an honest talk and let her know that her comments are not only abusive to your bf, but also you. If she doesn\u2019t respect that it might be time to consider if she\u2019s someone who deserves to be in your life. \n\nI hope that you and your bf stay healthy and happy together.", "My bad for the assumption about who she may be dating gender-wise.  Yeah, being more serious might be the issue considering the age between you two.  It's not a big difference, but usually, the older sibling experiences things first, and if you've already found someone who you are serious about she could be worried you are not getting enough experience or a tad jealous that you may already have found someone of marriage material.  Hopefully, she comes around.", "Thank you so much! I really needed some reassurance that I wasn\u2019t mad for thinking she was wrong. Probably is just an excuse she\u2019s rolling with but thank you!!!", "That is super interesting to me. Is that where this comes from? Because it makes as much sense as the story of the nativity on the face of it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for that. It makes a little more sense to me now. I looked into the so called 'science' but not where it came from.\n\nRegardless, I shall start looking into where this obvious bullshit actually came from.\n\nThanks again.", "Luckily not fully. My mum isn\u2019t overly keen because she does trust my sister but my dad really likes him and is super supportive", "Thank you! I have been putting the work in although I still have a long way to go! I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come but I think you\u2019re right. My sister will always see me as a baby. \nIn fact, my mum uses that as a reason why I should forgive her because \u201cI\u2019m her little sister\u201d\nI just wish there was a kinder way of setting boundaries, or at least keeping a positive relationship", "Or could she have known him in high school or something and have leftover resentment from a feud from back then she doesn\u2019t want to share, because he is closer to her age than yours?", "No she\u2019s never acted this way- she is justifying the change saying I\u2019ve made bad past decisions but she\u2019s never been so openly vocal. It\u2019s to the point where she is even rude to my partners face", "So she loved one of them- a high school bf, one year older. She still goes on about how lovely he was and tbh he was a sweetheart, just not right for me. The rest of them she was indifferent to. \nHowever, she has said to me before that I should just date women (I am queer so this could have happened) so it might be that she feels I\u2019ve chosen wrong? But my attraction is massively based on personality so it\u2019s nothing to do with gender identity", "She's probably jealous.", "I am totally buying into the excuse theory. I wonder what her real problem is? It all sounds rather odd.\n\nAnyway, I hope you can find a way to resolve this and wish you all the best.", "My parents are four years apart. I honestly don\u2019t even really see that as like that much of a gap. My first serious relationship was with an 11 year ago gap.", "She wouldn\u2019t have known him in high school as we grew up on different sides of the country. But it\u2019s possible she was upset I found someone at my age that I\u2019m so happy with", "Well, the point stands that you arent the asshole. Protect yours and your bf mental health and dont tell her anything about him and you", "OP THIS IS HUGE. It honestly might be homophobia/biphobia?? I know you said you\u2019re queer but I know with my friends that are bisexual and see their friends who are queer/bi, dating men.. they get really upset and demeaning to their relationship and partner. Maybe try exploring that possibility? I\u2019m pan and some people in the community (hate to stereotype but gay/lesbian) can be homophobic to people who are open to dating different genders and such!! NTA. I\u2019m sorry this is happening :(", "Ah.  Now I get it because the calling him old thing when there is only a 3 year age difference, AND you're both in your 20s so adults, had me completely baffled.  It's not the age that's the problem, it's the gender, but she won't admit that be ause than she will be seen for what she is, biphobic (I think is the right term) which is, in my opinion just as bad as homophobia.

He was very against generalisations like \"left brain, right brain personalities\" (most brain functions are distributed across both hemispheres to some extent, and those that aren't can usually adapt in cases where people have a brain injury on one side), as they're not helpful.\n\nThis 25 year old thing isn't quite as bad, it's based on proper research, but it's just based on observations of the brain from the \"outside\" so to speak, so it's hard to make a judgement about what effect the structural changes are having on the person's mind and personality. It could be very little, if what they're measuring actually amounts to perfecting and strengthening pathways that already exist. It's impossible to know from looking at gross rates of cell change across the prefrontal cortex what exactly that means.\n\nWe used to think there were no new neurons being made in the adult brain at all, but that has been shown to not be true. Neurogenesis happens in several areas of the brain all the way through life.\n\nAnyway, your sister (doctor or not) shouldn't be using a neuroscience study to infantilize you and make it seem like you don't know what you're doing. There was a lot of hoo-ha about that study in courtroom law, where they shut down very quickly any idea that it might mean under 25s were less responsible for crimes. The world has decided you're an adult, so you deserve to be treated as one for better (having your decisions respected) and for worse (not being able to excuse crimes lol).", "She\u2019s had very bad experiences with men. So her fear is understandable even if not fully okay. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s been this way with female friends", "My only other thought is that if she's older, she might feel guilty for the not being able to protect you from your past bad relationship so she's trying to protect you now.\n\nDepending on what queer circles she runs in, there are groups that straight up hate men, consider them disgusting, and even to the extreme of wanting them dead. There's also \"gold star\" lesbians who won't sleep with a woman who has ever slept with a man (some go more extreme to things like never kissed a man or won't sleep with a woman if she's ever been penetrated by anything phallic shaped - but that's the more extreme end). So she might consider it \"disgusting\" that you're in a relationship with a man.\n\nAnd then there's biphobia/panphobia towards queer girls who date guys because they are \"straight\" and therefore don't face adversity because they \"aren't really queer\". If your sister is in these circles, she might resent you for not facing discrimination even though you have the label \"queer\" (which sounds bizarre but it's not unknown). (For the record, I'm not saying you haven't ever been discriminated against, I'm just saying that the discrimination bi people face tends to be minimised by the Ls and Gs in the community). \n\nShe might also resent you for \"choosing the wrong side\" or because the lesbians are \"losing a queer girl to a man\".  I've seen this stance be taken sometimes, and I've heard bi people (women in particular) internalise this and express their own frustrations at not dating another women and coming across as disappointed in themselves for falling in love with a man. \n\nIf she's in circles that are reinforcing the toxic \"all men are trash\" narrative, or resents you for \"no longer being gay\" or \"not facing discrimination\", this could reinforce any internalised feelings of guilt from not being able to protect you from a man, and so she wants to get you away from men. It creates a sort of feedback loop of \"I feel guilty I couldn't protect my sister from a man\" to \"I don't trust the man she's with because I don't want her hurt again\" to \"all I hear are bad things about men\" to \"there are no good things about men\" to \"men will lie, cheat, hurt and steal to get what they want\" to \"I must protect my sister from all men.\"\n\nNow this definitely might not be the case, but if she already had concerns about you dating a man after the last relationship(s) you had, biphobia might have made it worse and exacerbated her desire to protect you.\n\nBut you know her better than us, and you know her friends better than we do too. Just wanted to share some thoughts since the biphobia I've experienced has made me feel shamed for being attracted to men in the past. Maybe she's trying to shame you?", "Wow so this was a classic case of biphobia???? Wow. Your sister is a piece of work.", "NTA. The problem with someone who is overprotective is that sometimes they start to like the \"knight in shining armor\" feeling sooo much...they keep trying to knock the damsel back down to being in distress. If she acknowledged that you are a full adult in a happy healthy relationship, she would also have to acknowledge that your relationship is changing to one of equal peers, and that you won't need to rely on her as much anymore. But if she can push the comfortable old script of you being a poor naive victim and him being an evil seducer, then she gets to be the champion riding valiantly to your rescue.", "NTA. \n\nIs your sister chronically online? There's a sliver of social media obsessed with the idea that age gaps are inherently abusive, and their idea of what constitutes an age gap can be pretty ridiculous.\n\nIn any case, you didn't cut her out of your life - you cut off her ammunition.

You explained it much better- just super familiar!!", "Well actually there are studies saying it\u2019s true humans are still growing until 24. However usually at least physically before twenty most have their adult body. For the brain it means you are at supposed to be at your top performance at 24, as the fastest to treat information, which many confusing it for the level of maturity. So learning will take longer, not that you are done. \n\nAs your age difference, your sister is unfairly stretching it for what it\u2019s not, as he seems the opposite of trying to coerce or control you, in the contrary you are describing him as giving you the strength to thrive. Which is lovely. \n\nOn the other hand your sister sounds jealous. Either that you found someone making you happy, even more than her, or any other reasons who are a she problem.

I feel like there is an underlying reason you dislike (bf), if you ever want to tell me why, I'm here. 2. You say I've cut you off, but what I've done is set the boundaries I'm comfortable keeping. 3. My boyfriend is not a creep, and if you continue to speak about him like he is, I will be forced to go low or no contact.
