If your wife has no issue with it, why should it bother you?", "YTA. You realize you are basically accusing your wife of sexualizing your 11 year old son, right? Why is this different than when she saw him naked as an infant? Do you really think so little of your wife?! Of course she is insulted- you are insinuating something disgusting. You are also teaching your child to be ashamed of his body and suspicious of his mother. \n\nSo many problems.\n\nETA: because there are people on the world who unfortunately do deal with a problem in this area- if you are *legitimately, actively, and truly* concerned about your wife\u2019s actual behavior, you should be seeking help from the appropriate authorities. If your wife is displaying predatory or inappropriate behavior, Reddit is not the place to come for help. If this is *not* the case, and your wife is behaving exactly as a trustworthy mother should, then you need to wake up and understand that you are finding problems where none exist, and creating issues where they don\u2019t need to be. You are putting ideas in your child\u2019s head about the person he should be able to trust more than anyone in the world, and that could cause absolutely irreparable damage to many relationships. If your son hasn\u2019t asked for more privacy, then he should be free to trust his family as he chooses, and lock his door only if he chooses.", "YTA. YOU think he's too old for his mom to see him like that? He's not uncomfortable; your wife wasn't either before you sexualized their perfectly normal interactions.

The implication is always the same - you think someone here is a perv.\n\nLook,  if the kid *wants* privacy, ya'll need to start knocking on closed doors like the rest of the civilized world but it really just sounds like you think your wife is trying to sleep with her own son in which case you need a divorce and a police report, not a locked door.", "YTA.

You sound very controlling. \n\nIt is not a big deal for a mom to walk in on their son while changing. Your overwhelming need to sexualize their relationship is very weird to me. You could have easily had a conversation with her that just said - \"maybe its time WE start knocking before WE wander in since he takes forever to get dressed.\" And then just have a conversation with your son to stop calling either of you when he is naked unless it is truly urgent. \n\nTelling him to lock the door is a bad idea. That just leads to hiding all kinds of things as he grows into being a teen.

If you openly communicate with your kids and your spouse, they\u2019ll express to you when they\u2019re uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s also not about females vs males\u2026 It\u2019d be a whole lot better (far earlier than 11) to teach your kids to be aware of their feelings and to speak up if anyone (male or female of any age) is making them feel uncomfortable and also to recognize when they may be making someone else uncomfortable.

It wasn't like the most fun I've ever had but it wasn't exactly a big deal.", "Why does he have to announce his presence if it\u2019s no big deal that he sees you naked? It\u2019s because it\u2019ll make him uncomfortable. \nAll you people talking about him probably traumatizing his son have no clue. You know what\u2019ll traumatize him?

It\u2019s a social norm for people of the same gender to be naked around each other. Like in dressings rooms and what not.  I am a woman and I change around my mom all the time but it would be kind of weird if I got naked in front of my dad. Not even in a sexual way, it\u2019s just not really socially acceptable. I feel like 11 is an appropriate age to teach a boy that he should put his private parts away when women are around.", "Ur reading into this way more. He's teaching his son that there are boundaries between genders and family doesn't matter. I don't want my son walking balls out in front of his mom. And I wouldn't want my daughter tits out I'm front of me. Only times people should see u is. Showering after sports or gym or in the military. And should be kept to the same gender. At no point should opposite gender be able to freely watch. Idc if it's his mom or grandmother. Once puberty starts boundaries start. You act like he told his son it's okay for men to play with him like that when clearly that wasn't said. Boundaries exist especially with family. Idk about yall but incest is not good. Yall need to stop this keep it in the family shit", "I had a therapist friend argue with me SO HARD that they\u2019re not a little while ago. I was very confused because even my basic research showed it was pretty easily found to be nonsense", "Oh bb", "Mom can definitely be a safe place but people are acting like the dad was wrong to stop the son from being naked in front of his mom. Why is anyone supporting a pre teen being naked in front of his mother. That's not normal. Now if he had a question or concern then yeah come talk to his mom. But please don't tell me ur fine with ur sons being balls out in front on u thru out the day. Cause that's what people here are asking for. Boundaries doesn't equal sexualizing", "U clearly haven't had the luxury of a growing up around people. Men see men naked in the showers at a gym or school after sports. What they don't do is leave that shower area naked for the females to see. It's one thing to be okay with your gender seeing u. But the opposite gender is different. And for the love of God let's not turn this into a gender debate please. There's a reason why there are separate bathroom and showers for genders. Also he's 11. He's not a tiny child. He's entering or has entered puberty. His dad said it's one thing if ur not fully dressed around me or ur brothers but u need to cover up in front of ur mom.

Great parenting. \n\nThe poor kid is just trying to exist in his own home. He\u2019s not luring your wife there in the hopes she, what, sees a boner??? You\u2019re being absolutely disgusting. \n\nYour child is comfortable in that level of clothing \u2014 and there is NOTHING inherently sexual about someone being in their own home & in pajamas, even just undies. \n\nYou\u2019re the one associating *your own child\u2019s body* with sex.

Something is mentally not right with you.  He's a child.  My husband who's 27 , if we go to his parents to stay the night he has walked around in a t-shirt and boxers because it's just his parents and I there . For you to say you wouldn't let your daughters if you had them walk around that way either , they are children!!!! You are taking his innocence way too soon and trying to make sexualize him. Its disgusting and disturbing.  Your wife should be concerned.", "My now 80 year old mom had covid a couple of years ago, and I had to help her with bodily functions.

It should be about his boundaries and not yours forced upon him.", "My mom did this when I was 12. The tool drawer was in the only bathroom with a tub. Using locks was not allowed, her rule, mom threw a fit about him seeing me naked. Up until then nobody cared. It messed up my relationship with my dad who was innocent. She was probably right but wow  how weird.", "If it was about boundaries, you and his brothers shouldn\u2019t see him naked either.  When the time comes that he is uncomfortable with other people seeing him naked, you AND YOUR WIFE should tell him that everyone will knock before entering his room, you and his brothers included. \n\nYou act like his mother is a sexual predator.   The fact that you have these thoughts makes me wonder about you. Normal people aren\u2019t thinking anything sexual about a mother seeing her son naked, even at 11.\n\nOr are you afraid your son is going to be attracted to his mother?  Exactly what thoughts were going through your mind when you were 11 years old?

You've just created an alternate scenario instead of dealing with the issue at hand.", "What?? Why would it not be okay if the child needs help? I honestly believe you need some serious therapy.", "First off I don't believe in keeping it in the family. Mine sure did and that's why I'm a survivor of child SA. If the convo went how he wrote in this post then he needs to go back and do some clarification. I was that 11 year old. I don't think anyone should be watching this child change. Boundaries are great. I was just told cover up. Problem is It wasn't actually explained why. And I spent years in a very bad situation. I advocate for education so that less children are victims. He needs to explain to this child that no one not even himself has a right to see him naked unless he chooses that. Quite frankly it should have been hey dude you're getting up there in age and it's time to talk about boundaries and what is okay and not okay for someone to do. Education can save a child. Ignorance can leave them with scars they will wear for the rest of their lives.", "The only person in this thread with some sense Jesus fuck", "It\u2019s not the dad\u2019s decision to make, whether or not his wife and son should have a boundary in place. Nudity isn\u2019t inherently sexual, and teaching their so through an action like this that it is, is the only thing wrong in this situation.", "I thought it was just him not being fully dressed when the mom walked in. 11 is still a kid, but I do think that a kid deserves privacy and the mom should knock. I do wish the father would have made it a privacy issue rather than trying to drive it home that his mother should not see him naked. I feel like that could cause him to not talk to his mom about things concerning bodies etc. I had a kid in my class who was being SA but wouldn\u2019t talk to his father, because he felt that it wasn\u2019t a manly thing/awkward and wouldn\u2019t talk to his mother because he felt like he was too old. He was 12 and I only know because he tried to commit suicide. So I guess I focus on making sure that there is open communication, not over sexualizing things, and stressing the fact that 11 year olds have the right to privacy and mom should never walk in without knocking first. Mom should be told that. I knock on my 6 year olds door. Boundaries are important.

I get u have ur own situation and struggles but none of this is SA. Odds are he shares a room with his brothers and probably uses a gym locker room with his dad. Thus the reason why it's okay if they are around when changing or moving thru those areas. Either way I feel u have taken a convo between a father and son and implied ur own story to it. Which is half the problem with people here. This isn't about u or have anything to do with ur situation. I again don't see anywhere in there that made it seem like SA is even on the table. And everyone saying he is the asshole is doing so because u talked about setting boundaries. Saying that he's worried about his wife and son together which is again made up in their own minds.
