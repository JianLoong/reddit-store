In what messed up world are you not allowed to *share that you dislike raisins* without offering two essentially unrelated 'complimentary' preambles? This is so freaking odd. Maybe well-intentioned, to form more positive exchanges, but this feels really extreme and counterproductive to me. \n\nNTA. Your wife failed to uphold her part of the agreement you'd made - whereas its intended to allow someone to voice a complaint or request, she has repurposed it into a new thing in which the complaint/issue is not heard at all IF accompanied by positive sentiments...which a complaint must always be. Facepalm. \n\nDepending on your dynamic here, you're both kind of dumb or she's manipulative. Think about it this way - you're not allowed to voice a complaint unless it is prefaced by two compliments, BUT if you preface a complaint with two compliments she then assumes the complaint doesn't apply? Magic! No complaints are ever made!\n\nI suggest you get to therapy to get some intense guidance for how to actually communicate in a partnership.", "What.................... did I just read?\n\nSounds like a great way to cheapen compliments and to set up the listener to always expect something negative after a compliment.  If my wife says something nice to me I don't want to then start wondering when the other shoe is going to drop.\n\nShe's also an idiot for her reasoning about the cookies and the 2/3 thing.

A clear, unambiguous request.\n\n> Eve replied that since I had given her two compliments on the cookies but only one complaint, she thought I enjoyed her raisin cookies more than I disliked them, so she continued with the original recipe. She said they couldn\u2019t be that bad if 2/3 of my comments about them were positive.\n\nWhat in the name of Charly and Algernon is this 'logic?'\n\n> But before I could continue, Eve interrupted in a warning tone: \u201cCareful Pete, remember our agreement.\u201d\n\nShouldn't she have prefaced that with two compliements?\n\n> I couldn\u2019t pretend anymore and that the eating the raisin cookies like this was unbearable \n\n'Unbearable?'

This \"rule\" seems like some bullshit from TikTok or something. You can't have a clear conversation if everything has to be sugarcoated. \n\nIf you like cookies without raisins, just buy or make your own cookies so you don't have to keep up this charade. There are ready to back cookies in the freezer section at every grocery store on the planet.", "so you and your wife always have passive/aggressive conversations, and you think this is healthy.  Why can't two grown ass adults just say what they really mean without having a fight about it.  You both are asses.", "NTA.  No offense, but your agreement isn\u2019t practical because it obviously impedes clear communication.  I get what you two are attempting with this, and it\u2019s great in theory but how do you have a constructive conversation that way?  The situation you just described is a perfect example.   Anything negative you have to say must be prefaced with 2 compliments; that just sounds like an impediment to a clear, constructive conversation.  \n\nAnd FWIW - I bake all the time.  It\u2019s insanely easy to NOT add raisins to a portion of the dough because the raisins are put in at the end; take part of the dough out, then add the raisins to the rest.  You deserve raisin-free oatmeal cookies, OP!  \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. While your wife does not have to make you cookies, it was a simple request and your wife used the agreement against you.

I rarely made anything with nuts, because I enjoyed the cookies almost the same with or without nuts.", "Is this something you guys came up with after therapy?

How hard would that have been? She offers you a cookie and you say \"Oh no thanks, I don't like raisins! Thanks for offering though!\"\n\nDon't let stuff fester, dude.", "ESH.  \"I have even strongly implied my dislike for them\"  Look, if your agreement means you can't come out and say something, that's bad.  If you haven't come out and just said it before, well that's on you.  You can't get upset if someone doesn't read between the lines.  However, once you finally did say something, she should have listened.", "This sounds exhausting. ESH", "While the agreement is 'sweet', it's also crap. So, you have to compliment in order to speak your mind, but it doesn't actually matter in the end because of the compliments. \n\nESH because this agreement is a load of shit and was bound to backfire at some point. Both of you are weaponizing this 'trend' against one another. Just friggin communicate like adults.", "This sounds infuriating. ESH, you are two grown adults in a relationship, not 2 employees at your annual review. OY VEY", "ESH- this is no way to have clear communications.  And sorry but that might work on kids but adults should be able to handle someone saying \"Hey I'm no fan of raisins, could you make a few without them please\" .   You aren't saying anything mean about her cooking you are just a request.", "NTA - By her logic, anything she has ever complained about can be glossed over with this 2 to 1 thing.  I understand valuing the importance, but sometimes you have to be able to discuss uncomfortable stuff without having the blows softened. You present it calmly and without attacking, but it has to be addressed.  \nI get the sense that the cookie thing is just the trigger of issues surrounding this 2 to 1 system of discussions, and you need to think about why this does not work for every situation.", "I would say NTA. \n\nShe should've understood that by you saying you hate raisins, you, y'know, hate raisins. The agreement you have with her to give two compliments seems odd to me, but whatever works for you. I don't think you're an AH for breaking that agreement because she was being willfully obtuse.", "both are AH's that sounds like a stupid loop hole she figured out before you did. Like others have said you cant take any complement serious cause you are waiting for be insulted or criticized. Sounds very 2nd grade to me on handling any communication.", "NTA.  If this agreement is affecting clear communication, it doesn\u2019t make sense.  If you truly told her that you don\u2019t like raisins in a clear manner, she\u2019s either not very bright, or she doesn\u2019t give a darn about what you think.", "ESH. Your wife totally disregarded your feelings and used your agreement against you. As for you...bro, it's cookies. Just don't have any if you don't like them.", "ESH\n\nI can't imagine having to give my husband two compliments before saying anything. You had to follow this rule to tell her you don't like raisins and would like a few without? This is no way to live, and it's being weaponized. I'm exhausted just thinking about it.", "ESH. Both of you gor making that stupid agreement, her for not caring whether you like the cookies and you for yelling at her", "NTA - her logic makes no sense\n\nYou straight if asked for some cookies with no raisins, so how does your two compliments mean you are okay eating them?\n\nAnd of course you gave two compliments, that\u2019s was the agreement, those two don\u2019t take away from the complaint\n\nAlso you don\u2019t have to be grateful for things you don\u2019t like\n\nI hate raisins, if my fianc\u00e9e made me cookies with raisins I wouldn\u2019t be grateful because she made me something I can\u2019t eat when she knows I don\u2019t like them", "ESH\n\nHow long do you estimate it will take for both of you to graduate kindergarten and start acting like two functioning adults?", "ESH. I\u2019m tired just reading this.", "I can see how you were attracted to your \"agreement,\" perhaps feeling encouraged it may help you both de-escalate conversations. \n\nBut the \"agreement\" is failing you (both) for a number of reasons.  First, the \"complements\" cloud whatever phenomenon at hand you feel poorly about.  Second, it doesn't require you to say how you feel.  Third, it doesn't require you to state a need.  4th, it doesn't require you to ask the other to meet your need.\n\nFinally, your wife has weaponized the agreement by twisting it to shut down conversations she doesn't want to have.  Which, it's okay to ask for postponement of a conversation, if one feels burnt out or whatever; but she is not being clear about that.  And let's be fair, you didn't ask her to unraisin a part of the cookies, so you can't complain too much.\n\n\nI think until you change your agreement to become actual, usable nonviolent communication (per the Rosenberg book, *Nonviolent Communication*), you both will labor on being obtuse to each other.\n\nYour agreement was a good first step though, so you are on the right path being open to positive changes.\n\nThis is NAH to me for the attempts.", "ESH for signing up for this agreement. This sounds like two immature people who can\u2019t handle any kind of criticism thought they had invented a clever workaround. \n\nBased on her 2/3 reasoning - does that mean she has never changed anything, ever? Because the 2:1 compliment to criticism ratio doesn\u2019t change. If I\u2019m reading this right, she has never, ever taken any of your negative thoughts seriously because the good has always outweighed the bad.", "ESH - this is a technique used by teachers, which doesn't make it bad, and she is talking to you like a child.\n\n>\u201cCareful Pete, remember our agreement.\u201d \n\nYou are mad because she didn't know that you didn't like raisins when you never told her. You also could just make your own cookies, it's a box mix. And also, cookies are so easy to make, how lazy are you?\n\nShe is using the agreement in two different, inconstent ways so that she can \"win\".", "ESH- one thing to add, the number of commenters who think giving compliments is not clear communication is pretty depressing. \n\nI disagree with how OP's wife is using this, but at the base this is very simple, when you have an issue with someone you always remind them of the things you appreciate about them first.\n\nIt is a really effective technique. It is much easier to take criticism from someone that also recognises your strengths.", "ESH This agreement is ridiculous and your experience shows why it actually impedes clear communication. You are both AHs to make such a stupid way of talking to each other. Also your wife is one to ignore your telling what you prefer and weaponizing this agreement. And you are an AH for writing \u201cmy wife and I\u2019s agreement\u201d instead of \u201cmy wife and my agreement.\u201d \n\nThe two of you sound a bit exhausting. Just tell her that you don\u2019t like raisins. It sounds like she already knows that and is just being obnoxious about making them her way.", "if you told her time and time again she just doesn't care to leave out the raisins. NTA that's a weird agreement to make when somone is upset they don't care to compliment first.", "Nta.\nWhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.\nWhy would you agree to something like that? It sounds like a form of torture. It's almost abusive because it removes clear communication.", "NTA and that is the weirdest rule I have ever heard.   She doesn't owe you cookies but she cannot expect you to like them or say you do when you don't.  I would weaponize her use of the rule against her too.  Seems she uses it just to get her way.  I mean every problem 2/3 will be good so there should never be any problems or issues by her way of thinking.  I highly suggest therapy so you can communicate like adults.", "First off, NTA.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, your wife and you have an agreement that anything negative you say has to be prefaced by two compliments. You give your wife negative feedback, prefaced by two positive comments per the agreement. Then she ignores the negative feedback because 2/3rds of the feedback was positive? You literally can't give less than 2/3rds positive feedback without breaking the agreement. It seems like the agreement only exists so your wife can ignore all negative feedback from you.\n\nSecond, the way she warns you to about the agreement before speaking makes her seem controlling. Obviously she can tell that you're upset about something and she's pre-empting you so you don't accidentally speak directly and tell her how you actually feel. In a marriage both partners need to be able to express themselves freely and know that their partners will listen and try to understand where they're coming from. OP's wife has created a system of communicating where either partner is free to ignore all critical or negative feedback. That's not healthy.\n\nLast, I want to add that all the people saying that the OP can make his own cookies are missing the point. The wife wasn't making cookies only for herself. The OP told the wife, as clearly as he could, that he didn't like raisins in his cookies. She ignored him and put raisins in all the cookies. In doing so she was telling OP that his preference doesn't matter to her. That's not healthy in a marriage.\n\nI feel like some marriage counseling would help the two of you to come up with an effective means of communicating and giving feedback without hurting each others feelings. It will also help identify if there are other issues at play that make communicating normally difficult.", "NTA, but this is one of the dumbest things I've ever read. We try to make sure we remind one another that we love and value one another when we have to bring up something potentially hurtful too, and there is nothing wrong with saying \"oh sweet, thanks for making cookies!\" before mentioning that you don't care for raisins, but the neurotic attachment to 2 compliments for anything even remotely not positive is just dumb. The sane version of this would be saying \"thank you for making cookies, I appreciate it, but would you mind not putting raisins in mine? I don't like raisins\". Not liking raisins isn't an emotionally traumatizing topic, your wife is being an asshole, and the fact you two have this agreement makes me suspect one or both of you is chronically an asshole enough to need it.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt sounds like you stated clearly that you don't like raisins. It isn't an obscene request to ask for a few cookies without raisins. My husband bakes all the time, and if he makes something I don't care for I just ask him if he would mind doing xyz differently. He never takes it as an insult.", "NTA. \n\nI do agree with your friends that you aren't owed cookies, so if your wife wants to bake them with raisins, then that's her choice and you can make your own cookies. BUT, I think it is okay to ask for something to be done differently- I want feedback on the food I make for my partner- and your wife is using the rule about compliments differently than it was intended. \n\nThis compliment thing in general isn't going to work out. It just because a chore to do and isn't genuine, to get to the complaint. At some point it is super disingenuous and I wouldn't even believe the compliments my partner gave me cause I know he was just pulling shit out of his ass to then tell me I was annoying. \n\nSecond, now your wife is saying that if you compliment the same thing you are complaining about, now she can weigh the complaint against the compliment? That makes no sense. \n\nThird, you didn't \"renege\" on the agreement, because you weren't complaining, you were disagreeing with her. So now, if she says \"it is hot in here\" and you want to say \"actually, I'm chilly\" you have to compliment her twice before that? No sir, that's no way to live. You followed the rules, then she used the rules to not bake raisin free cookies, and you wanted to disagree with her logic. That's not a complaint, that's a conversation. \n\nNo wonder you lost it. You are living in The Good Place where you have to feign joy and happiness at all times, and when you break from that your wife scolded you like a cat about to push a glass off a table, and then your friends add in you aren't entitled to cookies...you need all new things in your life- wife and friends- but start by buying yourself a chocolate chip cookie.", "YTA.
