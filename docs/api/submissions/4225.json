I wasn't sure how much you were able to talk to her before she passed, but knowing you did get to gave a conversation like this... it only reinforces that you're not am AH in anyway. \n\nLegally that money is yours. Your mother decided that. Husband trying to change it after her passing and claim it was her \"wishes\" is sad and inappropriate.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. And I'm sorry that her husband put you in a position where you're left questioning if you're an AH to keep the money or not, despite it being your mothers decision. Whether he is purposefully lying or not, it's just really sad and awful.", "You say mom updated her will and policy way back, in 2019. I\u2019m sure she absolutely knew what she was doing and the fact that she didn\u2019t discuss it during your conversations later only strengthens that supposition. Rest assured you don\u2019t have to explain to anyone why you won\u2019t give up any portion of your policy payout. NTA and so sorry for your loss!", "Well there you go she wanted that money to come to you, again please don't give him anything. He is only looking after himself and his daughters.", "NTA. OP, listen. Changing a beneficiary on a life insurance policy is CAKE. It's a form. There is nothing to \"straighten out\". At all. One form, a signature, and it's done. DO not give him anything. I'm so sorry for your loss. My point being it's not some long drawn out legal thing to be done.", "Keep it. And don\u2019t feel guilty about it either.", "Step father, yeah. Our father passed as well several years ago. I really don\u2019t think he would lie to me, so I wonder if I\u2019m the asshole for wanting to keep it if those were my moms wishes.", "I cant speak on her behalf, but I find that giving a large portion to her husband & step children and you splitting the remainder to be a little suspect. I still say NTA and you keep the inheritance aside from funeral costs. If those were your mother's wishes I truly believe she'd have had her will adjusted accordingly. Just my 2c!", ">I really don\u2019t think he would lie to me\n\nEveryone lies. No exceptions. even if it's just a little one here and there, like saying \"Fine\" when someone asks how you are and you're really miserable. Maybe that was your step dad. Maybe now that money is on the table he's upped his game. Maybe your mom lied to him about including his kids to shut them up.", "Mom often said things for effect and this is also possible. Its such a nice notion to leave him the most and include his kids. But If she was there with pen and paper in hand I wonder if she really would have signed to cut that person out and clawed back our share."]}
