We'd known each other for nearly a decade at that point. We were 25 and we depended on each other for emotional support.\n\nWe then started a Youtube channel with a mutual friend, Ray. John\u2019s a fashionable person. He's quite sociable and was sensitive about how he looks in those videos.

Arranging a day to shoot is a lot of work and stressful. But we talked about it. Agreed with the notion that the person hosting gets to make the final decision but does need to discuss it in the group chat first before acting on the decision.\n\nThen the first incident happened, he looked at the 2nd edit of a video and deleted the raw footage. Then, he shot the whole video and then ask Ray to edit it again. Ray was upset. And I agreed with Ray as the raw footage was reviewed by him and approved before even the 1st edit was done. Later, we find out that he didn't watch but approved it because he was busy. When I did not take his side, he blew up at me. And I wasn't perfect. I blew up at him back. It was ugly. We took some days to cool off. Then we agreed not to 1)Pass approval without actually reviewing. And 2)Communicate before making a decision so that others can provide alternatives. \n\n3 months later, we were doing a review of an important board game and he volunteered to host. The video went through 3 edits before posting. It was two weeks of hard work. Ray and I were happy and had high expectations. The next morning, Ray called to tell me that the video was gone. It was John who deleted the video. We all got on a group call and his reason was that he looked terrible in the video and he doesn't want millions of people to see his face. We had 2K followers. I'm not proud of what I did. I got angry and shouted at him that he has no right to do so. A screaming match ensues. After the call, Ray and I decided that it was not working\n\nThe next day, we met to tell him that our working relationship is over. We will remove him from the team and if he likes, would remove the videos that feature him. We weren't monetized back then so there was no money involved except equipment and I immediately refunded his share then and there. It was cold. I know. It wasn't even an ultimatum. It was just a clean-cut. That's why I feel guilty. I did explicitly make it clear that this doesn't mean our friendship has ended, just our partnership. But that was the last conversation I had with him since then. He immediately unfriended Ray and me on all social media and avoided every friend gathering that I'll be at.\n\nI was angry too. I didn't make any effort to reconnect after. But now, many years later, it all looks silly. But I don't know whether I should start with an apology.
