Monday evening comes. We have some snacks and the Muslims go to pray. According to my other friends, Emily said she was going to the loo (which is next to the prayer room). What I know is that suddenly the prayer room door opened, there was loud music and she started dancing in front of the room.\n\nI left my prayer, called her a cab and admittedly yelled at her calling her disrespectful and to leave my house and get out.

She knew exactly how offensive she was being.\n\nMocking a solemn religious service isn't a funny prank. It's just mocking a solemn religious service. Not a prank nor funny. She's probably not being honest about what happened because most people have the ability to understand that you shouldn't mock people during a serious moment.", "NTA. You don\u2019t play pranks when people are praying your friend is the AH.  Would she go into a church with a boombox?", "NTA at all.
