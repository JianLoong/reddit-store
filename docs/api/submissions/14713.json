She knew exactly how offensive she was being.\n\nMocking a solemn religious service isn't a funny prank. It's just mocking a solemn religious service. Not a prank nor funny. She's probably not being honest about what happened because most people have the ability to understand that you shouldn't mock people during a serious moment.", "NTA. You don\u2019t play pranks when people are praying your friend is the AH.  Would she go into a church with a boombox?", "NTA at all.

If it's at your expense then it has another name: bullying. She clearly knows you didn't take it well. But obviously she's trying to save face by trying to twist the story.

If I am in someone's home and they say grace before eating, same thing. \n\nYou and your family were in a completely separate room from your guests, with a closed door. Before you even went through to pray, you were very clear with the one thing that would be highly disrespectful to you, your family, and your religion. You should not have even had to say this, as it should be common sense. \n\nYour friend absolutely knew without a doubt that this would not be seen as a prank by you or your family. She intended to be disrespectful and play it off as a prank. If she really intended it to be a prank, she would have tried to get some of your other friends in on it. She lied to them and said she needed the bathroom as she knew if she told them her plans, they would have stopped her. \n\nHer behaviour was abhorrent, and then she had to cheek to go whining to her parents, for them to berate you, also during a very religious time for you. \n\nShe is no longer a friend, I'm afraid. I know it hurts immensely, but she has no respect for you, your family, or your religion. \n\nHopefully, your parents will come to realise it is not your fault once they have had the chance to process what happened.", "Ramadan Kerim to you and your family (and your observant friends as well). I think your mum should absolutely get involved because I'm sure that Emily didn't tell anyone (or at least not her parents) what that \"silly prank\" was. Her parents might not be willing to listen to you, but they might be willing to listen to your mom. Although maybe see if it's possible to talk to them after iftar. Difficult discussions are better to have when you are not hangry. Surely giving the facts in a calm an factual tone would not impact on the fast?", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re well surrounded! Don\u2019t mind whatever others who sided with her say!", "Worse for them. Best for us. And humanity.", "Killing Piggy was just a prank, man!", "Fair enough. Makes Emily an even bigger asshole.", "Rumours spread.  \n\nI don\u2019t work in a violent school, but I\u2019ve seen 6 on one for the RUMOUR a child insulted Allah. \n\nThe rumour of someone saying the N word was 10 on one.", "Even if not exactly on your team, they should definitely be staying out of it at a minimum.  They weren\u2019t there, they should shut their mouths.  \n\nThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things.  Some of my favorite shared experiences have been outside of my own culture and I hope this doesn\u2019t ruin the joy of sharing your traditions, faith, and life with others who truly care for you and respect you.", ">.  And any friends that are okay with what she did, maybe let them go, too.\n\nOP needs to make sure he sets the narrative straight with them since it seems like Emily is not being completely truthful with their friends about what she did", "Correction: she did dumb and immensely disrespectful thing. OP prepped her guests ahead of time about the need to respect those in prayer at the event.", "Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m not religious anymore, but my family is. I bow my head silently while they pray. That\u2019s just\u2026 decency.", "Yeeesss exactly what I was thinking. No matter the religion you just don't do this. She knew EXACTLY whawas doing. doing.", "Recently attended various Buddhist temples in Thailand, I\u2019m an atheist but made sure to ask questions about what was acceptable and tried to be as modest as possible while there. I considered it an honor to be invited to see these places even if I\u2019m not interested in joining the religion.", "Exactly - I don't know jack about most religions outside of Christianity.\n\nIf someone told me they were a \"Hooka-Booka\" and they were going to do a moment of silence to pray to the Great Spaghetti God, I would have the basic understanding that interrupting them would be a deeply moral offense, even if I didn't understand their religion.\n\nThis is basic human decency.", "Yes. My sister's ex-wife is an atheist and for the 10 years they were together she bowed her head and was silent any time my family said grace at a meal. That is just decency.", "Actively opposed to all organised religion here and also agree you don't interrupt someone while they're praying unless its supremely important. \n\nThat prank was disgusting.", "I'm betting she thought it was 'funny' because she perceives Islam as a 'bad' or 'fake' religion and therefore not worthy of any sort of respect :-(", ">I\u2019m a huge prankster. I relish making people feel uncomfortable.\n\nAH. What could possibly posses you to declare this about yourself like it's not something to be deeply ashamed of?\n\n\"Yeah, I just love making people upset because I think it's funny and my ability to get a laugh is more important than the feelings of others\"", "Too many shows + youTube channels has somehow gotten the idea that \"rude=funny\".\n\nThis episode is akin to the whole \"bucket on head challenge\"... simply offending someone doesn't make it funny.", "Same here, would never occur to me to be so disrespectful to anyone and definitely not someone I'd been friends with so long.", "Oh, I totally agree. Emily was horrific in this situation and OP couldn\u2019t have done anything to prevent this, she was a class act.\n\n\nHowever, I thought it best to provide cultural context on general British attitudes to prayer and why I very much doubt Emily would have respected Christian prayer practices.", "I went to a multi-ethnic school and no one in my year, or the year either side was Muslim. Several Hindus, the odd Protestant here and there who practiced, a few Moonies (lol), a couple of non-practicing Jews, a single non-practicing Sikh, and someone who followed Inuit-belief. \n\n\nI left prior to sixth form in 2010 and I\u2019m from the North East, which likely impacts the demographics. Not quite sure what\u2019s going on these days.", "Jammy git. At primary school level, I remember a Hindu mate getting bollocked for not singing along with hymns in our non-denomination state school. I\u2019ve heard from a lot of other friends that they were also forced to sing hymns at their state schools.", "Nope, I simply wouldn\u2019t be found at any religious event- I was more responding to the idea of the girl disrespecting Muslims but she wouldn\u2019t disrespect Christians\u2014 pretty bold assumption as most Christians wouldn\u2019t befriend a Muslim anyway. Pretty sure she\u2019s just a jackass not partial to one religious group or another.", "Ooh, I know this one! The three Abrahamic faiths - Rastafariansim, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, and Samaritanism.", "The abrahamic ones and some of the others too.", "We go to a grammar school. I\u2019ve never even heard of anything remotely aggressive let alone actually violent", "I am British and big difference between rebelling at forced religion in assembly and disrespecting prayer before meal when guesting with someone. You might think it odd but you still respect your hosts, whatever religion.", "British people aren\u2019t determined to mock religious people. You\u2019re reading far to much in to 1 opinion you heard about", "North east has one of the lowest Muslim populations in the UK. there\u2019s like only c1000 in County Durham for example. \n\nTbh, I\u2019m not sure any north east school is multi ethnic.  They\u2019ll be white Christian or culturally Christian with the odd one who isn\u2019t. \n\nMidlands\u2026 40% Muslim in a catholic school.", "Maybe I was! I wouldn\u2019t bother with some hymns at the school where we sang them. I have to say, your school teachers/admin were twats for that\n\nThe only people I know who had that throughout were those who went to religion-affiliated schools, but even then there were accommodations made for those of other religions\n\nOne of the state schools I went to had a room for multi religious prayer", "I don\u2019t know a lot of Christians who would refuse to be friends with a Muslim.  \n\nI can believe that this happens but I\u2019m really glad those people are not around me.", "jimmy bimmy and stimmy lmao \nu were close tho....", "Oh. It\u2019s gone up to nearly 3000\n\nhttps://www.varbes.com/demographics/county-durham-demographics"]}
