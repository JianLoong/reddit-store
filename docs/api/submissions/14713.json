Every year I\u2019m allowed to invite some of my friends over for iftar (the meal at sunset) and we always have fun. I usually mostly invite my other Muslim friends.\n\nThis year I decided to invite everyone on Monday evening.

I told them that it\u2019s disrespectful to walk in front of someone praying and to disturb us and that it can even \u201cbreak\u201d our prayer and we would have to start again.\n\nOkay so. Monday evening comes. We have some snacks and the Muslims go to pray. According to my other friends, Emily said she was going to the loo (which is next to the prayer room). What I know is that suddenly the prayer room door opened, there was loud music and she started dancing in front of the room.\n\nI left my prayer, called her a cab and admittedly yelled at her calling her disrespectful and to leave my house and get out. My parents are furious at me because of her actions.\n\nEmily thinks I\u2019ve overreacted to a prank, she even had her parents call me and berate me and she\u2019s telling all the people that weren\u2019t at the iftar that I threw her out of my house over a joke.

I'm guessing your religion is important to you, so do you really want to be friends who has such a disregard for your religion?", "Would she suddenly blast music and dance if she was in a group of people with their heads bowed in a Christian prayer? She knew exactly how offensive she was being.\n\nMocking a solemn religious service isn't a funny prank. It's just mocking a solemn religious service. Not a prank nor funny. She's probably not being honest about what happened because most people have the ability to understand that you shouldn't mock people during a serious moment.", "NTA. You don\u2019t play pranks when people are praying your friend is the AH.  Would she go into a church with a boombox?", "NTA at all. Emily is not a friend and her \u201cprank\u201d was in extremely poor taste. Ignore her parents, they\u2019re a large part of the reason why she is the way she is.", "NTA I'm a freaking atheist and think all religions are nut but I would never show such disrespect to a friend.", "NTA. Woooow. There's no excusing a \"prank\" of this sort. That's a seriously high level of disrespect. She can't have been friends with you for long enough to get invited to this to NOT know that it's something she should respect. It was NOT a \"joke\" - it was almost literally shoving her middle finger in your face.", "Jokes are meant to be funny. \n\nWhat she did was extremely rude and disrespectful.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Pranks are silly goofs where everyone laughs later, they're not bigoted jokes where an entire religious group is mocked. Emily is not a friend.", "I would make certain everyone knew the full details of what she did.\n\n\u201cYes, she pulled a prank. My entire family was in the middle of prayer and she burst into the room, blasting music and dancing.

You specifically mentioned what is offensive to you and your religion, and she purposely did it.", "NTA. I'm not religious at all, but damn that is disrespectful.", "NTA I feel mortified for you and she should be ashamed of herself. You invited her to a special occasion for your religion and she absolutely disrespected not just you but your entire household. She owes you a massive apology", "NTA\n\nThis person is clearly not a friend.", "NTA. I have some Muslim friends and from what I understand, Ramadan is a very solemn event of very high importance and must be observed correctly. What she did was very short sighted in mocking other's beliefs.", "NTA, you explained what she could expect and she was incredibly disrespectful of your religion. it's a privilege for someone to invite a non-religious friend to something like iftar and she's disrespected you and your religion in the name of a 'prank' which isn't remotely funny", "NTA, Emily fucked around and found out.", " NTA\n\nThere is a time and place for joking around.  Right in the middle of someone's religious ceremony is not it. Especially when you've explained the situation.  She is not your friend.", "NTA. What is wrong with this girl?", "NTA - That's not the time or place for pranks.", "Nta! But Emily is. And I hope your mum doesn't blame you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t care who you are. She has shown that she cannot be respectful toward you or your family. She also has zero respect for you if she thought this was a good prank to pull.", "NTA. It's only a joke if you found it funny. If it's at your expense then it has another name: bullying. She clearly knows you didn't take it well. But obviously she's trying to save face by trying to twist the story. She doesn't sound like a respectful friend. You might consider examining your past relationship with her and see if there are any patterns of disrespect. It might very well be the case that she's not someone you will stay friends with after this. And it could be for the best. It depends on if she sincerely apologizes I think.", "NTA- Your house, your rules. Not to mention that the gathering was for the iftar and she manages to do the one thing you told her not to do during that time. This was a prank played in poor taste and it sounds like you'd be better off without Emily's \"friendship.\" Would she find it acceptable to interrupt a church service in the same way?\n\nI'm sure your parents would have some choice words for Emily and her parents.", " NTA.\nWhat kind of prank was that? \n\nIt was incredibly disrespectful and rude. \n\nIt looks like the trash (Emily + those siding with her) are taking itself out", "NTA. You explained the traditional and she thought it would be funny to disrespect you. You were totally right to kick her out.", "NTA at the very least, Emily and the friends who have believed her story have a lot of growing up to do. Don't bother yourself about them.", "You are absolutely NTA. I\u2019m not sure what kind of \u201cprank\u201d includes disrupting and disrespecting a religious practice, but it\u2019s not a funny one. You were kind enough to call her a cab home (which is more than I would\u2019ve done), and if all you truly said to her before she left is what you posted, then you did absolutely nothing wrong. She is TA and you should end that friendship. Her parents are also TA for allowing/perpetuating her behavior.", "NTA. Emily is an ass & not a true friend", "Nta. You told her it was offensive", "NTA - that is so disrespectful on your friend's part.", "NTA, she disrespected you and your religious beliefs at your own home. She owes you and your parents an apology! And she needs to grow up.", "NTA", "NTA. I am absolutely flummoxed as to how anyone could side with Emily in this. What she did was incredibly disrespectful and rude. I rate her 0/10 as a friend.", "NTA and I doubt her parents would be having the same reaction if she did something similar during a christian easter pre-meal prayer and was kicked out for it.", "NTA - Damn, that's a prank in a sense that \"It's just a prank, bro? Why are you upset?\"\n\nPranks are harmless.\nThis was pretty offensive and she WAS given ample information that it's a solemn event. Given my understanding of Iftar. \n\nEmily - YTA", "NTA    I'm trying to think of something to say, but am absolutely flabbergasted by the ignorance, disrespect, and audacity of this person. It's appalling behavior, and if she can't figure that out, it's time to ditch this person as a friend. \n\nWhat should you apologize for? You were far more kind than I would have been.", "NTA\nshe didn\u2019t respect your beliefs and was extremely offensive ,you had every right", "NTA she sounds awful, ignorant and just plain bad mannered.", "NTA.  That's not your friend.", "NTA: OP, Emily's behavior was hideous, grossly immature and disrespectful.  She has also shamed her friends. Avoid her in the future; she does not respect anyone and her behavior is unpredictable when she wants attention. She is trouble.", "NTA, and I say that as a devout atheist.\n\nEven putting religious belief aside for a moment, interrupting you like that when you explicitly asked her not to is incredibly disrespectful. \n\nIf I\u2019m at someone\u2019s home and they say \u201cI have this tradition I follow before we get to the partying. You don\u2019t need to take part in it, just please don\u2019t interrupt me,\u201d I\u2019m absolutely NOT going to interrupt them for what I assume is a Tik Tok video.", "NTA- time for new friends. And those that side with her even tho they weren't there are followers. You know what happened and your friends saw what she did. If it were the other way and you interrupted her prayer time she would be livid. People always wanna talk about your reaction bit never about what they did. Bet if she went into detail it wouldn't be so okay to everyone", "Hey i get offended, did you mean \u201cEmily\u201d me? \ud83d\ude21 /s", "I have zero respect for religion, so my attitude towards \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d is \u201cSo fucking what?\u201d That said, your house, your rules: you can kick out whomever you like for whatever reason you like.
