And what kind of monster cuts off their own sister for being afraid to go to a funeral? Nobody in that family is going to hate her for having that fear. They might think it's odd, but they aren't going to hate her. Obviously your mom won't hate her. I doubt anyone else in your family is going to hate her, but you run the risk of alienating a lot of people for being so uncaring about your sister. I'm thinking it's you that has to get over it.", "YTA\n\nYou can't judge her beliefs and fears like that, she has no obligation to go to the funeral. Honestly, as someone who recently lost two grandparents, no one in the family pays attention to who is or isn't attending the funeral. Another thing, she can show how much she cared about Kat to Kat's family in other ways than going to the funeral.\n\nBut the worst part was what you said about her blowing up relationships, you put psychological pressure on her to make her feel guilty and anguished for not doing something you think is right.", "NAH - She is free to go/not to go.\n\nChoices have consequences.\n\nYou are just telling her what are the likely consequences of her actions.", "YTA for assuming family means you can force behavior. Would you have said that to someone you weren\u2019t related to? Are you going to shun other people who don\u2019t come, or only the person you can get away with this behavior with?", "You are being a jerk.  Your sister has a fear. Even if you don't understand it, you should empathize with her. It's a funeral. In the big scheme of things, this is not a big deal(at least where I live). Was she there for your friend when she was alive? If yes, then that's all that matters. I know a few people who don't attend funerals because being around dead people is not something they can do. No one I know holds it against them. \n\nYTA", "YTA-  Wild that you think someone is going to take attendance, notice your sister isn't there and blow up the relationship because she couldn't attend. A grieving family is very unlikely to lash out at a family friend who didn't make it to a veiwing- because that's not how healthy people with resonable boundaries behave. \n\nInvitations are not summons. It's perfectly okay to respectfully decline an invitation, even if it is to a funeral or viewing. \n\nThe fact that you will blow up your relationship with your sister for not complying with tour demands indicates she is better off without you in her life. You sound manipulative, controlling, and unkind. \n\nIf", "YTA, everyone has their own way of coping with death. And you being upset toward her doesn\u2019t help the situation. People need comfort in a time like this.", "Yeah, YTA. I can't relate to the fear of ghosts, and I think that's a bit troublesome for an adult - but people grieve in different ways. Forcing someone to grieve in the way you want her too, and then not forgiving her for it, is an AH move. Some would rather remember the person for who they were alive vs dead laying in a coffin. She could show her respect to Kats family by sending flowers or donating in her own, and talking to friends and family after/before the funeral to continue to help with the grieving process. Missing the funeral because of a fear she has seems forgivable, although she should probably deal with that fear somehow", "I think she's not an asshole, but needs therapy or something. That's an irrational fear there.\n\nYou... I'm not sure. I think the fact that you said \"including me\" is the one that makes me want to go with YTA rather than n.ah.

Just because you are vindictive and petty, doesn\u2019t mean everyone is a cruel as you are. \n\nIt\u2019s her decision to attend or not. You don\u2019t get to decide anything about her attendance. \n\nYou can pay your respects to a deceased friend without going to a funeral. \n\nYTA, again."]}
