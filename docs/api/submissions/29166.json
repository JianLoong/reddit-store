I can't relate to the fear of ghosts, and I think that's a bit troublesome for an adult - but people grieve in different ways. Forcing someone to grieve in the way you want her too, and then not forgiving her for it, is an AH move. Some would rather remember the person for who they were alive vs dead laying in a coffin.

What do you think Kat would say if she knew you were trying to bully Sammy into going to a thing that would be scary and traumatic? \n\nI'm going to guess that this is just your grief coming out. That you know Sammy will love you no matter what so you feel like it's okay to lash out her with the anger you can't lash out at Kat for. It's okay to be mad that Kat is gone.

If you don\u2019t wanna accept the basic premise of reality that ghosts don\u2019t exist, then I am not sure you really want to solve the issue.", "Came to say this. If a person believes that God and Satan are real, angels and demons are real, and heaven/hell are real, then souls, ghosts and spirits are just as real. Are we at the point of ridiculing true believers? Religion and the supernatural are inextricable. People in these comments act like church doesn't propagate these beliefs, when IMO this is the source of a lot of fears like OP's sister. I grew up in Ohio and saw the first Mormon Temple east of the Mississippi being built and my area had a large Mormon demographic as a result. One time at a sleepover someone brought out a Ouija Board to play. Our Mormon friend saw it and before the box was even opened, started hysterically crying and screaming and ran outside, yelling that we needed to get away, the house was unclean now, etc. She refused to come back inside, made us call her mom, we stayed in the yard with her until her mom came to get her, and she never came to any other sleepovers. OP is saying we should have dragged her back inside and played anyway because none of the rest of us felt that way about the game. What kind of friends would that make us? Over the years I've met other people who left their respective churches as adults, specifically because as kids, SCARY supernatural things were told would happen to them, as a deterrent for bad behavior. \"Satan is always watching\", things like that...

I personally don\u2019t believe in ghosts or the defined concept of energy in crystals, but I do find great peace with crystals and I believe in the idea that, as our atoms are constantly changing, we are utterly entwined with the universe, which means it can be a swallowable idea that someone feels comfort and familiarity with an object like a crystal. I understand the grave importance of science but I don\u2019t think you need to throw away a method of finding connection with your life and the universe and (for some) embracing the history of their culture as \u201chokey woo-woo\u201d.\n\nI say this with respect, as I also agree that therapy and rational treatment are required long term, but as someone who enjoys embracing the history of witchcraft and crystals, I think we should provide more space for non-patriarchal, non-organized religions focused on honoring nature and kindness. Many people would likely feel more at peace with death if they didn\u2019t fear hell and instead honored the magic of the journey.\n\nOkay sorry for that last sentence I literally just smoked a bowl not deleting it though cuz accountability i guess.", "But, from OPs description she's afraid of the \"ghost\" not the body? Or perhaps it's both. I don't mean that her fears are childish or irrational or anything,  but I do feel that if it's keeping her from doing things - like attending a long time friends funeral - it's worth doing something (Or two) to help her be able to do these things. If she wants to, of course.\n\nEdit to add: if my saying using crystals etc was a good idea is what made you think I was treating her childishly,  not at all. Whether I agree with their beliefs or not, many people genuinely believe in the healing properties of items such as stones.", "[removed]", "but if her fear is affecting her ability to live life generally, that is something warranting at least therapy. They mention she even has trouble with meat, which might be because she's worried about the ghosts of animals haunting her from the rest of the context? or maybe she just doesn't like the idea of eating dead animals, which, fair. Either way, it sounds like her fear does prevent her from doing certain things, which does affect her life depending on the degree of severity \n\nIf some placebo crystals or sage can help her in the short team, it's a great low-weight solution to remove some disruption in her life, but therapy is really ultimately going to be needed, less she risk her fears following her and even getting more severe\n\nOP, I think YTA for threatening your sister with your relationship and no trying to approach the issue from her angle.

Which is true enough - ***a crippling phobia is a mental health issue,*** *which your sister would probably benefit from therapy for.*   \n\\- You and your mom should agree to repeat your sister's apology to the friend's family at the appropriate point, and leave it at that - do not go into details about \"why\"..

I don't believe in ghosts, the afterlife, the spirit, etc. And that's part of the problem.

I don't know if/when I'll ever attend one.\n\nMy family only recently learned about this issue but years before I was put into an uncomfortable situation when visiting my parents. It was late and someone called the house. I heard my mom crying shortly after answering the phone. She then told my dad that a close friend of theirs had died suddenly. I wasn't close with the man, but I considered him a friend, and several years prior he had been a bit of a mentor to me in my career. I was definitely upset, but not as much as my father. I never want to hear the sound he made again. It was devastating.\n\nBecause I was the most composed I insisted on driving them to the hospital. Knowing full well I was going to be extremely uncomfortable/possibly have a panic attack. I waited outside his room as my parents were inside grieving. I met his girlfriend (another family friend) when she arrived and comforted her. I met his youngest son and kept him company. I never went in the room.\n\nI didn't want to see him like that. I didn't need to see his body. I didn't need to be in there to provide assistance and comfort to my parents or his family.\n\nAnd you know what people said about my not going in there? \n\n# Not a goddamn thing. \n\nEven without knowing my hang-ups with death, nobody said anything about me not going in that room to see his lifeless body. Because even as shitty and oblivious as my parents can be in other areas of life they understand that grieving is an entirely personal experience, and everyone does it in their own way. My mom asked me just one time, \"Do you want to see him?\" before he was to be taken to the morgue. That was it. I said I wasn't comfortable, and she accepted it.\n\nHow dare you emotionally blackmail your sister over something like this. You are absolutely the asshole, and a selfish one.", "100% YTA.

I understand it would be easier for you if your sister went with you but if she really cannot go then you shouldn't force her. My sister, especially when we were younger, did not handle death at all well (I mean even worse than most people). She was never \"expected\" to do anything.  Many times there were compromises, she would go but stay in the parking lot or reception area. Due to your sister's fear she may not even be able to do that.  I am sure your sister's phobia is not a deep dark family secret and other people must know about it.  Have any of you even thought of a compromises? If there is a get-together after that is not at the funeral home your sister could go there or even go there while the wake/funeral (not sure which) is happening and help get everything set up and be there to greet the initial guests.  Even if they are not doing a get-together/coffee hour there is no reason why your sister cannot bring the family a dinner, platter of food, etc. before or after the funeral at their house where she can provide her sympathies.  Many people cannot handle funerals and, I am not sure what anyone believes, but I cannot imagine one of your dear friends wanting to put your sister in such a difficult and emotionally charged atmosphere with her phobia on top of it - not if the person was a real friend (let alone her sister!!!).", "YTA\n\nDad died and two of my siblings didn't attend, guess what, that's okay.

For the people I've gone to a funeral for, the image of them in their coffin dominates my memory of the person. I don't want that image to be the final one I remember them by. I missed both grandparents and my aunt's funeral earlier this year. Yes, my grandma understood my reasoning for avoiding funerals and she was fine with it. I also have crippling social anxiety around other family members. I'm sure she wouldn't want me to have a panic attack in the middle of the service. As for your sister's fear, others may think it's irrational, but it's very real to her. Trying to guilt trip and lessen her fear is an A-Hole move.

To be blunt, Kat isn't around to miss your sister's presence at her funeral so you shouldn't either. A funeral is for people to get closure, not for you to judge how others react to a loss.

Of course, you shouldn't say she's afraid of Kat's ghost.  A migraine of just vague panic attack will do.

Hungary, Greece, Canada, all over the US - Mum was there with us. She had a kidney disease and I gave her one of my kidneys. My dad and I held her in our arms as she drew her very last breath. I will never stop aching for her.\n\nI didn't go to her funeral. Why? Nothing about it would make me feel better. It wouldn't make her any less dead. I devoted as much of my time and life and literal body to her as possible while she was alive, and I loved every single second of it.\n\nWas there fallout from me not going to her funeral? You bet there was. Do I give a tiny rat's ass? Nope. I couldn't possibly care less the opinion of others about this (and most other things). \n\nIt's nobody's business how another person grieves. Attempting to insert yourself into another person's grief and grieving process is a massive, gaping, prolapsed, asshole thing to do. \n\nStay in your lane. Mind your business. Quit it with the threats. You worry by yourself about appearances and protocol and the societal expectations you think matter and let her do what she needs to do in the manner that works for her.

No one has the right to tell someone else how they grieve. Full stop. \n\nYou might be right- her decision may completely torpedo her relationships. But you pointing that out or making her feel bad for not being able to overcome her clearly deep-seated anxieties (you thought a girl who won\u2019t even eat meat would attend the viewing/funeral of a friend? Come on\u2026) is an asshole move.", "YTA. A funeral is a public mourning of grief, not a necessity.

I took care of my MIL for 2,5 years before she died and I just couldn't look at her when she was dead. My husband went to see her one last time, I just couldn't do it.

The person is gone, deal with the pain and loss in whatever way you can most easily tolerate.\n\nGrieving is a personal thing in my opinion. We should be allowed to do it in the fashion that works for one's self. I think many people benefit from having a big sad party. That's fine if it comforts you, but I'd be a trainwreck and don't want to participate.\n\nLost my best friend and all my grandparents in the last few years. I've never been to a funeral.

My reasoning was, I don't want to see my mother laying on some morgue table dead. I just don't want that visual in my head at all. I wanted whatever memories I have of her to be when she was living and laughing and having a good time. My family respected my decision and I respected theirs.

Totally agree, YTA! \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating when people pressure you into things like this. I had a traumatic incident that happened when I was younger and it makes funerals and hospitals very difficult for me. I lost what I thought was a good friend because I didn\u2019t go to her grandmothers funeral. I\u2019d never met her grandmother but I knew they were incredibly close. I tried to compromise by saying I would meet her at the reception after the services, but she wasn\u2019t having it and called me every name in the book about my selfishness. It\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to work past, but unless you\u2019ve experienced it, you won\u2019t understand. I also suffered for years with panic attacks, and they were triggered by driving for some reason. It makes zero sense to other people, and it makes even less sense to me. I\u2019m fully aware of hot irrational it is, and I honestly miss driving very much. But when one hits, a quarter of a mile can seem like an eternity and I feel like I\u2019m going to die before I get there. What doesn\u2019t help any of this is people putting pressure and ultimatums on me, because I\u2019m already beating myself up about how irrational it is. How much it interferes with not just my life, but others as well. Anything someone says, I\u2019ve said to myself more times and in a much crueler way. I\u2019d give anything to not have to deal with it and when you pressure me, it only sets me back farther. \n\nEase up on your sister and try to have some empathy.

Even if it's a loved one who knows my fears I still would be afraid of them coming back as a ghost.\n\nAs I've grown older, I've gotten used to it; especially after my mother died of cancer and I sat with the body until the hospice nurse confirmed death.

What kind of grown adult is afraid of ghosts? Ffs. I get having a phobia but if it\u2019s affecting you this deeply, then you need to work on it so you can function in society. That is every adult person\u2019s responsibility towards themselves.

I'm not scared/disturbed by dead bodies, but my personal beliefs make it so I feel no sentimentality for the body left behind, and something like a viewing gives me no personal comfort/emotion.

I have to take prescribed meds. And they only help in the moment; it\u2019s not a cure. It\u2019s literally an adrenaline blocker so that I don\u2019t feel my fight or flight so hard. They make me feel kind of numb which isn\u2019t a nice feeling either but at least I can function better.  \nThis person has, as described by OP, a quite debilitating, irrational fear that is likely being exasperated by grief.   \nThreatening her isn\u2019t going to snap her out of it. That kind of reaction doesn\u2019t work for mental illness. Nothing will snap her out of it. Therapy could help her work out ways to cope and maybe come to terms with it, but snap out isn\u2019t going to work.  \nThat being said, I can see where you\u2019re coming from with the frustration. Mental illness doesn\u2019t just affect the person dealing with it but also the people around them. It\u2019s a tough position to be in and can lead to some resentment I\u2019m sure. The key to that is putting the resentment on the fear and not the person feeling it.  \nI don\u2019t know the sister so I don\u2019t know if they are over exaggerating for attention or whatever, so I can\u2019t comment on that.

Knowing it\u2019s illogical and knowing there\u2019s no reason to be afraid of something doesn\u2019t magically fucking cure your brain. Phobias aren\u2019t just a mild anxiety, they are a physiological reaction. I have a severe phobia of insects. Not \u201cOh, insects are gross! Ew! I don\u2019t like them!\u201d I break out in a cold sweat, I get fever-like symptoms, I have both puked AND fainted at insects. I start getting lightheaded when people mention them.

I\u2019m not willingly going into a butterfly garden, ever, even if it\u2019s for my best friend\u2019s wedding. Sammy going to the funeral, *especially* an open casket one, is the psychological equivalent of pointing a loaded gun at someone\u2019s head and expecting them to stay calm so everyone can have a nice time.\n\nSammy doesn\u2019t need to justify their phobia. Even if other people would take offense at their absence, OP screaming at them and verbally berating them because they don\u2019t think their phobia makes sense immediately makes them an asshole. Everyone grieves in their own way. OP and Sammy knew how Kat felt about them. I doubt Kat would want OP bullying their sister into attending an extremely intense emotional experience just to keep up appearances. Worse comes to worst, if people inquire into their absence, the family can just tell them it was too much for Sammy to be there. I had to stay home from my best friend\u2019s mom\u2019s funeral because I was suicidal and couldn\u2019t take on the emotional weight of everyone else\u2019s grief.

I think in this situation, the sister is clearly terrified, and it's emotional blackmail to try and make her go. She clearly needs therapy, but she can't get it and have it work before the coming funeral. So, rather than being a complete sick, the OP should show some compassion for her sister by letting this go and encouraging her sister to get therapy.", "I don't think she owes anyone an explanation. I do agree that other people might take offense, but that's because they assume other people should grieve in the exact same way they do. If the other people are going to let something like this affect their relationship with the sister, then they don't really care about the sister, either. \n\nMy brother has been to exactly 2 funerals since he was about 10 and could ask not to go: Mom's & Dad's. He didn't go when either grandmother died, not our beloved uncle, no one's but Mom & Dad. He just can't do funerals. We understand that and don't think less of him for it.", "I think it also depends on if the family plans to have a gathering after the funeral. If they are, then I see no reason why the sister skipping the funeral part would matter. But even if they don't, forcing her to go would be a great disservice to everyone, including the memory of the friend who passed. There are plenty of other ways to let the family know you care. Expressing condolences outside of the funeral, checking in on them or helping out/bringing food after, etc. So many people go to the funeral and that's it. The hard part of a loved one dying isn't the process of burying them; it's afterwards when everyone goes back to their daily lives and you're left alone with your grief.", "Sorry to be this person and ask nosy/personal questions, but also let me thank you for being so open and vulnerable. I had a camper with a similar fear but of kayaks, other boats she was fine with and could swim in the lake but the covered kayaks got to her. It wasn\u2019t as strong of an irrational fear I think as it could be, or maybe she just handled it even better than I saw. Only had her for like, 10 or 12 days I think, so didn\u2019t get crazy progress but got her in an open face kayak and tandem kayak, she did get in one for a tip test but had to sit out for a while after (note: challenge by choice and it was 100% her decision, she could\u2019ve done it in another boat). I was and am so proud of her, it was five years ago but she still stands out to me as so brace and strong, especially for a 13 (?ish?) yo! But, question is does it matter with a canoe if it is on land or in water?\n You don\u2019t have to answer of course, and thank you for bringing up the points you have, I think you make a really solid, reasonable argument for something that is by nature not seemingly reasonable for most. It can\u2019t be explained or argued or blackmailed away, and it is more than being a little scared, it is an overwhelming feeling that takes your body and mind over. OP, absolutely YTA and there\u2019s no question about it. You can\u2019t yell a fear away, and grief is hard enough as it is and YOU are being the irrational one here. So much for looking to family for help and support.", "I am so glad your cousin was there to help you, I know making a scene would\u2019ve likely only worsened things. You\u2019re so brave to have gone anyway. I am sorry for your loss, even as the years go by the grief is still there and you can still feel the absence of your loved ones. I think the possibility of a panic attack is something OP should consider (along with so much more, their behavior is clearly that of an AH and YTA for sure OP), and how much more distracting, impactful, embarrassing, distracting, and overwhelming that would be for OP\u2019s sister, the family, and all others in attendance. \n\nThe sister should and I\u2019m certain will reach out to Kat\u2019s family, and that\u2019s okay for it to be enough. Her friendship with her isn\u2019t any less because she want to be able to grieve in her own way and she has fears. I can\u2019t imagine if Kat knew about the fear that she would want your sister to put herself in such a painful position. Not for same reasons as the sister, and it\u2019s different for me in funerals, but with pets and animals death is terrifying, even if we would have something dead outside the front or back door (cat presents-yuck) when I was a kids I would cry and not go out that door for weeks. I used to think that if I didn\u2019t want to be near a pet that had died or been put to sleep it meant I didn\u2019t love them enough or I was bad, but as I\u2019ve aged I know it doesn\u2019t. They aren\u2019t there anymore in the same way and it\u2019s a shell of the personality I loved. It\u2019s okay to be freaked out or scared. OP, you\u2019re basically telling your sister everyone else\u2019s emotions and feelings are worth more than her own and her own mental health, that is sickening.", "Are these two button phobias the same? Like, is it buttons on a coat or buttons on a remote?\n\nu/Jingsley", "She can bring a baked good or even a meal to their house after the funeral. That will show that she cares.", "There are plenty of ways to honor the deceased that do not involve  attending a funeral.  Sister could perform a kindness for the immediate family, send a meaningful memorial gift or a nice meal, donate to one of the friend\u2019s favorite causes, or perform a community service in her honor.  Plenty of people cannot attend funerals for reasons as prosaic as having to work or not having a babysitter available at the time.  Anyone who burns bridges for this is simply not thinking clearly.  It would be far more empowering to the sister if OP encouraged her to find a way to express her grief in a way that she is capable of, in some sort of positive action, rather than focusing on the one thing she can\u2019t participate in as the be-all end-all of proper condolences.  I agree that the sister might benefit from therapy to reduce her fear, but that is a different issue from her being bullied into attending a specific event through threats of widespread ostracism.", "Ugh, never to a funeral, but I've had to be the one who showed up when other family flaked and it's the worst having to explain over and over why so and so isn't there. Definitely causes resentment.", "I completely agree. I have lost a lot of friends, the first being my bff, at age 20 & while I was a wreck, being there for her family was important to me. Especially for her sister that found her. \n\nWhen I lost my ex gf (25), my main concern was her father because he had just lost his only child. I reached out to him around the anniversary for the first 2 years but shortly before the 3rd one, he crawled into her bed & blew his brains out. That's what I had been so afraid of & why I consciously made such an effort. I can't say I was surprised when I got the news but I still felt so terrible & while I don't believe in God, I had never hoped for a heaven so badly.\n\nI honestly can't count how many parents I've consoled. How many funerals I've been to, how many late night phone calls I've taken to trade happy memories with a grieving mom or dad. It breaks my heart & I know I will never feel that pain but I can listen & be present.\n\nIDK I kind of went off on a tangent but I said all that just to say that it's truly about being there for the family. It's much bigger than you can understand, unless you've been through it, yourself & I don't wish that upon anyone.", "After seeing it on Unsolved Mysteries as a child it was a fear I had for years lol\n\nSo speak for yourself ;)\n\n(/s if not obvious)", "Attending funerals is a pretty ubiquitous social expectation, though.", "We're all going to die, mate.\n\nAnd everyone we know is going to die.\n\nNot through spontaneous combustion, I grant you, but it's going to happen.", "I wasn't alone. My ex, my childhood neighbor (who my mom babysat) and my high school best friend were with me. I don't regret it at all. In all my memories of her, she's healthy and alive.", "It's beginning to sound to me more and more like a Catholic thing...", "I\u2019m fairly certain I would go to the funeral and scare everyone there for not believing my friend who is now afraid of me being dead.  That would be much more fun to make my body sit up and see how many people I can bring to the other side with me \ud83e\udd23", "Not going isn't the problem and she doesn't need to go into details about her irrational fear of ghosts imo, but if you don't even bother to reach out to the family to give condolences or anything and just \"ghost them\" (no pun intended) you look like an uncaring ah and it's understandable that the relationships would suffer.", "I have an uncle who doesn't do funerals. The closest he will get is the funeral home parking lot during the wake. He grieves in his own way, and nobody has ever given him a hard time for that. I can't remember if he was at my grandfather's funeral - it was 34 years ago - but I'm pretty sure he wasn't at my grandmother's or either of his brothers'. And everybody is fine with that.", "No worries on the question! I actually really love kayaking, and I've been fine with rowboats and paddleboats in the past! It's been very odd to me that it's canoe specific. \n\nThe effect starts on land and usually keeps me from actually getting the canoe out onto the water! I've gone a few times despite that, and it's been possible but feels like I'm in a constant anxiety attack. \n\nI used to think it was fear of the water, but kayaking proved that false. Only thing I could maybe see is that you'd sit higher in a canoe than a kayak or paddleboat, making my sense of balance cause the fear of heights, but rowboats seem at odds with that.\n\nJust weird!", "Or send flowers to be displayed at the funeral. It's what I have always done when I haven't been able to attend a funeral.", "Which is why it is important for people who can\u2019t/won\u2019t be attending to reach out to express their condolences themselves, so they aren\u2019t putting this burden on others.", "Scientists would forever debate if it was actually spontaneous combustion or if I exploded due to irony.", "It's still possible that the sister reached out to the family, regardless of whether or not she can go to the funeral"]}
