I can't relate to the fear of ghosts, and I think that's a bit troublesome for an adult - but people grieve in different ways. Forcing someone to grieve in the way you want her too, and then not forgiving her for it, is an AH move. Some would rather remember the person for who they were alive vs dead laying in a coffin.

What do you think Kat would say if she knew you were trying to bully Sammy into going to a thing that would be scary and traumatic? \n\nI'm going to guess that this is just your grief coming out. That you know Sammy will love you no matter what so you feel like it's okay to lash out her with the anger you can't lash out at Kat for. It's okay to be mad that Kat is gone.

If you don\u2019t wanna accept the basic premise of reality that ghosts don\u2019t exist, then I am not sure you really want to solve the issue.", "Came to say this. If a person believes that God and Satan are real, angels and demons are real, and heaven/hell are real, then souls, ghosts and spirits are just as real. Are we at the point of ridiculing true believers? Religion and the supernatural are inextricable. People in these comments act like church doesn't propagate these beliefs, when IMO this is the source of a lot of fears like OP's sister. I grew up in Ohio and saw the first Mormon Temple east of the Mississippi being built and my area had a large Mormon demographic as a result. One time at a sleepover someone brought out a Ouija Board to play. Our Mormon friend saw it and before the box was even opened, started hysterically crying and screaming and ran outside, yelling that we needed to get away, the house was unclean now, etc. She refused to come back inside, made us call her mom, we stayed in the yard with her until her mom came to get her, and she never came to any other sleepovers. OP is saying we should have dragged her back inside and played anyway because none of the rest of us felt that way about the game. What kind of friends would that make us? Over the years I've met other people who left their respective churches as adults, specifically because as kids, SCARY supernatural things were told would happen to them, as a deterrent for bad behavior. \"Satan is always watching\", things like that...

I personally don\u2019t believe in ghosts or the defined concept of energy in crystals, but I do find great peace with crystals and I believe in the idea that, as our atoms are constantly changing, we are utterly entwined with the universe, which means it can be a swallowable idea that someone feels comfort and familiarity with an object like a crystal. I understand the grave importance of science but I don\u2019t think you need to throw away a method of finding connection with your life and the universe and (for some) embracing the history of their culture as \u201chokey woo-woo\u201d.\n\nI say this with respect, as I also agree that therapy and rational treatment are required long term, but as someone who enjoys embracing the history of witchcraft and crystals, I think we should provide more space for non-patriarchal, non-organized religions focused on honoring nature and kindness. Many people would likely feel more at peace with death if they didn\u2019t fear hell and instead honored the magic of the journey.\n\nOkay sorry for that last sentence I literally just smoked a bowl not deleting it though cuz accountability i guess.", "But, from OPs description she's afraid of the \"ghost\" not the body? Or perhaps it's both. I don't mean that her fears are childish or irrational or anything,  but I do feel that if it's keeping her from doing things - like attending a long time friends funeral - it's worth doing something (Or two) to help her be able to do these things. If she wants to, of course.\n\nEdit to add: if my saying using crystals etc was a good idea is what made you think I was treating her childishly,  not at all. Whether I agree with their beliefs or not, many people genuinely believe in the healing properties of items such as stones.", "[removed]", "but if her fear is affecting her ability to live life generally, that is something warranting at least therapy. They mention she even has trouble with meat, which might be because she's worried about the ghosts of animals haunting her from the rest of the context? or maybe she just doesn't like the idea of eating dead animals, which, fair. Either way, it sounds like her fear does prevent her from doing certain things, which does affect her life depending on the degree of severity \n\nIf some placebo crystals or sage can help her in the short team, it's a great low-weight solution to remove some disruption in her life, but therapy is really ultimately going to be needed, less she risk her fears following her and even getting more severe\n\nOP, I think YTA for threatening your sister with your relationship and no trying to approach the issue from her angle.

I'm not aware of and medical benefits of dog poop bags lmao but here we are.

I enjoy the tactile sensation of the stones as a fidget, the sounds they make clinking in my hand is soothing to me. Tarot cards for me serve the same purpose as Rorschach blots. I can \"listen\" to my subconscious thoughts this way, by drawing a card and then letting the first thing that comes to mind bubble up and then examining those thoughts or feelings.
