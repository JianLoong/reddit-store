Before going any further, I feel like I need to mention that we are both really close and pretty touchy with each other. For example, they let me play with their hair, and I let them play with my hair too. We have a weird kind of bond where we don't mind saying that we \"love\" each other. But we are not together, we are just really close friends who trust each other a lot.\n\nWe went to a halloween party and had our arms around each other. I thought it would be funny if I grabbed their leg and lifted it up to make a funny pose, so I grabbed their leg and tried to lift it up. But they freaked out and screamed really loudly before pushing me away. They seemed really really scared. I expected them to be okay with it, and I didn't think I had to ask to do it. Most of the time when we are touching each other we don't ask each other for consent and we're both totally okay with it.\n\nI apologized a ton, and they said it was okay. They also apologized for freaking out so much. We were both really embarrassed and what was a good time suddenly turned really awkward. They told me they have a problem with people touching their legs, and that it makes them feel really uncomfortable.\n\nEver since then, they've treated me normally. It seems like they've gotten over it and don't see me differently, but I still feel really guilty and gross thinking about the fact that I touched my friend in a way that made them uncomfortable and afraid.

Touching my friend without verbal consent\n2. Because I did not explicitly receive consent to touch them, and the only way of being 100% sure they were okay with it would be to ask. Not asking means risking making them feel uncomfortable.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not odd in the \"i don't believe you\" way, more like odd in the \"there's some trauma or something they haven't confided in you about\". But it seems like they aren't upset and have moved on, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.", "Going with NAH. If your relationship is how you describe, and you\u2019ve never had this issue in the past and had no reason to believe something was wrong with touching their leg up to this point, then there\u2019s no way you could have known this would be their reaction. If they\u2019re over it, then all is well; just make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again :)", "Hard to judge but it\u2019s in the past now. If they\u2019ve moved on then you should, too.", "NAH.  You had no reason to suspect it would make them uncomfortable.  You both handled the situation about as well as you could.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. They stated a boundary and you immediately stopped and apologized. Now you know and respect the boundary", "NAH. Nothing intentional, apologies made and accepted.", "NAH. You crossed a boundary you didn\u2019t know about. It\u2019s valid they have this boundary, but also your action was valid given your overall relationship. Now that you know you won\u2019t do it again. Put it in the past. You\u2019re ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Apologize to your friend for betraying their trust. One thing to be intimate and close in private, but they also may not have been comfortable with the open display in public.", "They did tell me that leg touching makes them uncomfortable before, but I forgot because it was a long time ago and a one-off detail.
