It's a classic, really: he does something that upsets you, and when you do get upset, he gets angry at you and claims that you are overreacting. He never has any actual important reason to do that action, he just deliberately does it to upset you. He is training you, to make sure that you will always question your own boundaries and emotional responses, and if given long enough time, he can disrespect and mistreat you left, right and center, and in the end it will always be you who will question your own behaviour.\n\nAt least he is showing his real side early on, and you can ditch his ass before you get stuck too deep. This is why it's important to speak to other women, especially outsiders, so that they can point out the insanity.", "This is red flag behaviour.\n\nBeing startled is not something you can control and he absolutely knows that.

However, she loves to pull pranks and to spook me occasionally - and I like it too. We communicated early on in our relationship about what BOUNDARIES we need to feel comfortable. One of mine was 'hey while I don't mind you doing this sometimes, definitely not all the time and only in this context'. Lol I would have fled if they never listened!", "NTA! I also startle easily and my partner has responded by deliberately making more noise so I can hear him coming.", "Oversimplified brain functioning explanation. The hippocampus takes in signals and directs the input to wherever it needs to go. He touches you, the hippocampus sends the input to the amygdala (threat-processing center) and the prefrontal cortex (logic/reasoning center). The amygdala triggers the fight or flight response before the message even gets to the PFC, so you get a quick shot of adrenaline in case you need to run or fight off the threat. Then the PFC gets the message and you realize it\u2019s your boyfriend, but you still have the adrenaline running around and are ready to fight.\n\nSince fight or flight is triggered before the logic center even gets the message, you literally canNOT know what the threat is yet. The brain is wired to survive first, think later. \n\nHe\u2019s TA, you are NTA.", "I startle very very easily(thanks childhood trauma). I\u2019ve quit friendships because they don\u2019t respect my boundaries or continue to try to provoke a reaction out of me because screaming and dropping to the floor in a panic is \u201cfunny\u201d. Fear of attack, especially from being grabbed from behind with no warning, is ingrained in us as humans and not something to be played with or deliberately fucked with. He\u2019s deliberately scaring you and trying to make you uncomfortable and paranoid in your own home and personal space and then turning it around to make himself the victim when you are upset and scared. \n\nOP, I strongly suggest you think on whether you want to stay with someone who can\u2019t respect your boundaries and is actively trying to create a atmosphere of fear and stress. Your partner should not be the person who is a cause of stress or fear in your life. Very much NTA", "NTA! He sees that you don't like that and he continues. That is not ok! Some people don't like being scared when they are not expecting it and I totally get it! My bf know not to do that to me. If he tries to scare our daughter (she loves it) and scares me instead, I yell at him, curse, cry and he usually gets a slap on the belly to go with it. But he knows I don't like that, he doesn't do it on purpose and he apologizes. Your bf should respect you enough to stop doing that.", "Being startled is a normal reaction.I do this to my wife to get her attention, sometimes as a joke, sometimes just because I need her attention. She does it to me as well. How else are you supposed to get someone\u2019s attention when they have made themselves blind and deaf to the world? If I do it just to startle her, ( which I do sometimes), I could deal with, and expect a little anger, it is a little unreasonable to get angry over someone trying to get your attention. \n\nIf he\u2019s doing it only to startle you, he\u2019s the AH for being upset, at your anger.\nIf he is doing it to get the attention of someone who has made themselves blind and deaf, you\u2019re kind of an AH by getting angry.", "NTA. Everyone's level of nervous sensitivity is different; I know that I'm very easily startled by things that wouldn't necessarily cause other people to jump and squeak and feel their hearts thudding like they just sprinted round the block. And if your bf can't recognise and respect that about you, and be kinder and more thoughtful about how he interacts with you while you're absorbed in another activity, then he deserves to be an ex-bf for sure.", "NTA. I remember a post about a boyfriend who was dumped due to pranks he played on his girlfriend", "Yes, this reminds me of my friend's abusive boyfriend who would, whenever his hands were cold, press them to a sensitive part of her body to startle her. She hated it, asked him to stop, and he never would. He would get mad at her for not finding it funny. Eventually she started having anxiety attacks whenever someone touched her. Little things like these add up.", "Exactly. My ex used to pull shit like this. He would do something that he knew would upset me, I\u2019d get upset (shocker) and tell him what he did was wrong, he would play victim and say that I shouldn\u2019t be mad at him and I\u2019m the one in the wrong and would rile me up until I lost my composure and cried, and then he would try to \u201cconsole\u201d me and say that me being upset \u201cneeded to happen\u201d. I hope OP can see his behaviour for what it is, gaslighting and complete disrespect. He does not give a rats ass about OP\u2019s boundaries.", "People overuse gaslighting but I think this might be the real deal. He's scaring you on purpose and then trying to make you feel crazy for being afraid when that's obviously his objective bc he keeps doing it knowing what's going to happen", "Holy shit. I\u2019m glad you made it out of there safe. <3", "Yeah, that's what I'm wondering too.\n\nIf OP's computer is positioned against a wall, he can't just get into her sightline so she notices him. And she can't hear him. So...that leaves physical contact as a reasonable alternative. \n\nWhat *does* OP want him to do instead?\n\nMind you, if the screen/desk is positioned in a way where he can be in OP's sightline first, that's definitely preferable. But if that isn't possible then I can't blame the guy for going with the next available option.", "If he continues doing things he knows trigger your ptsd, then he is not safe. Simple as that.", "Where does it say the BF is doing it to get her attention on an important matter? It doesn't appear that he's getting her attention for any reasons other than to make her jump.\n\nEdit : in a later comment, OP has told him to wave at her from peripherals and BF refuses to do that. So she set up a perfectly good solution that he won't compromise with. OP is NTA", "Exactly this. Growing up I'd have my dad startle and jump by walking into his room while hes on the PC without even headphones. And his desk was on the pc wall where even his peripheral vision could normally see. \n\nWhen people get that 'blinded' by what they are doing ANYTHING to get their attention will startle them.", "Yeah \"put your desk in a direction where your boyfriend cannot startle and gaslight you\"\nSure\nAre you telling your boyfriend as well, he should do something against getting starled?", "This is absolutely wrong. (Or at least only could apply to the very first time, before she asked him to STOP.)\n\nAre you the boyfriend?\n\nThe alternative is fairly obvious: he waves a hand, calls loudly but pleasantly (yes, you can hear these things through noise-cancelling headphones), and at the very least doesn't *go off* on her for telling him not to touch her unexpectedly. He LISTENS to her and respects her feelings.\n\nIt's not about 'feeling safe' with the boyfriend, it's about suddenly being touched and startled! And, of course, also about the boyfriend being a sadistic jerk in response to a natural response (like ticklers).\n\nOP is NTA.", "I've seen this mentioned another time as well, and I'm sure it's bound to come up again \u2014 sorry, this wasn't something I thought to include. When he waves a hand in my peripherals, I can see him just fine and it doesn't spook me. He knows this, and I've recommended in the past that he just stand next to my desk instead of behind it before he went in to touch me or hug me. I joked it was like approaching a horse, y'know, never from the back and always from the sides. He did it a couple times with success, of course, but then... I don't know, forgot? I don't understand myself.\n\nI agree that how I respond may be too much, I guess. It's not how I *want* to respond; I'd love to be the cutesy girlfriend that giggles and goes \"oh no, you scared meee!\" but I'm not, sadly. And as far as the issue of trust, that's a strange thing to suggest. I've never once feared this man in our whole relationship. I'm just scared because someone is suddenly touching me when the second before that I didn't know someone else was even in the room.", "And rightfully so.", "Yep. And he\u2019s just getting warmed up. This will get a lot worse. OP, please leave this guy. This is truly disturbing behavior.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc9c\n\nI know the term Narcissist is thrown around a lot but I genuinely believe he has NPD, I'm just glad I never have to see him again in all honesty.", "Yeah, and to be fair, the main thing that frustrates him is if I'm having a bad day and I look scared & flinch and shit.\n\n\nI know it's his way of expressing that he's pissed off with my mother having done this to me, so I intellectually process it as protective and clumsy.\n\n\nHe's quite lucky, NGL! I am actually not scared of confrontation, but I WILL get triggered by being shouted at, so in person, I speak like I was raised in a therapy cult or something! Idk I guess my autism makes me take \"be considerate & respectful\" too literally or something! There's no reason for me to escalate something if the emotion behind it is actually something I would like - someone being devastated that I've got fucking PTSD. I know part of my \"Olympic Level Emotional Labour\" shit is conditioning/fear but fuck it, I'd rather not work myself up, have a meltdown and get punched by a policeman for crying again. (And that was in the years before http://stopsim.co.uk)\n\n\nUs fucking \"Borderlines\" are often misdiagnosed autistic women. I have multiple letters from the Personality Disorder specialist team stating I don't meet the criteria but the NHS will do anything to cling to the guidance of withdrawing care, even referring someone three times to a Personality Disorder team while they're begging for autism and ADHD assessments.\n\n\nI went private & got both. I spent 25 years being told \"you're just looking for excuses not to change\"\n\n\n\nETA: I meet three criteria. The letters from the NHS Personality Disorder Network in Nottingham a few years ago stated that in order to be considered for their dept, I would need:\n\n- Self harm bad enough to be hospitalised \n- Repeated suicide attempts\n- unstable relationships (I'd been in one for 7 years then, 12 now)\n\n\n\nLiterally the only 3 I met were impulsivity (Borderline/EUPD tends to only be self destructive/sabotaging impulses, whereas I am a living embodiment of YOLO), strong affect/emotions (yeah, ADHD will make me blurt that I LOVE things!!) and issues with interpersonal skills (duh autism)\n\n\nI am not a \"crazy lady\", I was suicidal because I'd coped with too much for too long. Meltdowns look like super distress and craziness because that's literally how the world feels to me and I panic and I haven't had a full blown one in several years. I can usually ground, remove and recover. Chronic pain means I cannot remove and recover, so I had them more often, but they wouldn't consider referring for autism and ADHD.", "The original post never mentioned anything about the BF doing it on purpose. That changes things and I would agree OP is NTA. \n\nTo explain my rationale - as the post reads originally, it\u2019s still unreasonable for the OP to close themselves off from vision and audio and then get upset. It\u2019s unreasonable to think from the first post that it was done deliberately to scare the op. Which is why I initially said ESH.", "OP and anyone really in this situation could see if moving the position of the desk (facing the door for instance).

It wasn't a big deal and works for us.", "Well that definitely changes things, he's a major AH for still touching you if you found a solution. Your reaction isn't over the top then, NTA.\n\nSorry if the trust thing seems strange, I guess it's a really personal thing and everyone feels it differently.\n\nEdit: sorry forgot he's of course also a massive AH for getting angry at you about your reaction, not just that he's startling you in the first place.", "It also didn't mention him ever having a concrete reason for getting her attention. It's not that OP is purposely upset, she gets scared like a reasonable person would, and then told she shouldn't react like that. Knowing someone gets scared when they're touched suddenly means I personally would avoid doing that.

The first time you say someone's name the brain goes \"oi, I heard something familiar, let's go on alert for more audio ques.\" And then sometimes a second time is necessary to go to high alert.

It doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with him, it\u2019s not like you\u2019d act the same way if you could see and hear him in particular approach, it\u2019s a pure fight/flight response that most people would have to some extent. Of course, there can be situations (like me) where someone is overly sensitive, but what you\u2019ve described does not sound excessive at all. \n\nI think a serious conversation should be had (not immediately reactive to an event) where you explain that this behaviour is not ok. He needs to understand the horror many people feel when suddenly being touched while they think they are alone, and the very real consequences repeated scares can have on a person\u2019s mental well-being.

It's hard to judge when there's not more information about the relationship.\n\nIf he's trying to be considerate and let you do your own thing and still wants to be physically affectionate here and there it probably does hurt him to then have the repeated response from you.

Again I know to you it's being scared suddenly but to him it might be that you are not responding to being startled but you are responding to his affection in a negative way. I think this is about more than some boundary but compromise for both of you.

You figure out a compromise and move on\n\nREPEATEDLY after someone has explicitly asked you to get their attention another way and you refuse to is not ok.

Someone who's partially blinded by their monitor does not pick up on cues in their peripheral vision.", "To be clear I wasn\u2019t disagreeing that a new method could be introduced as a solution. And there does need to be an option for him for when he needs to make contact with her. I used your comment to reply to because it is what sparked my thought. It was an additional comment not a counter point to what you said. This SHOULD be a minor issue with a quick fix but she\u2019s dealing with someone that not only makes it a big deal but that also knowingly creates a situation for him to play the victim. Her response is inherent, his behaviors are a choice.", "Per comment from 9 hours ago, she's offered alternatives. The boyfriend has even used those alternatives before and they don't cause her to startle. But then he went back to doing the thing she's asked him not to do", "Lol so his behaviour is completely excused by her wearing headphones sometimes? Interesting.", "She doesn't have trauma haha, she's an ass about being interrupted while she's engrossed in a video and instead of being an adult and getting over the fact she jumped, she got angry at him.", "I disagree, I think that's the \"partially\" in \"partially blinded\", i.e. \"there are some things I can't see, but not completely blind\".

OP shouldn\u2019t have to keep explaining that when they\u2019re at the computer, they don\u2019t want to be disturbed.

Who should apparently keep an inflatable bat or a pitcher of ice water or something by their chair to reinforce the repeated verbal warning they gave their bf that grabbing them from behind is not at all ever an acceptable way to get their attention.", "She's told him to stop.  Continuing to do something *after you've been told to stop* cannot be anything except intentional.  Are you the BF or something?  If I tell you \"don't do this thing, I don't like it,\" and you keep doing it anyway, you're an AH.  If you feel like you have some legitimate need to sometimes get my attention, then you can use your big boy words and ask me how I would prefer you to behave instead.  Someone who offers me even the tiniest courtesy would work something out with me instead of continuing an action for which I have expressed active loathing.\n\nI wanted my cat to feel safe in her own freaking home.  If I can do this for a cat, BF can do it for OP.  He's choosing not to be a kind person.  That's a choice he's making.", "Because of the obvious autonomous startle reflex.

If a man was at his desk with his headphones on and his wife/gf came and tapped him on the shoulder or gave him a light squeeze, as these are what op said he did. And the man exploded with anger in the same way she did, at his gf wife for startling him, all of the comments here would reverse to her side.", "NTA. My best friend/old roomate is very jumpy, super easily startled.

Just don't.", "Info: do you live together? Are you aware he\u2019s home? How much time do you spend w/ headphones staring at your screen? Have you had any conversations about how you would like for him to get your attention if he needs to speak with you when you have your headset on?

The same thing happens to me all the time, I like noise and my husband walks like a cat.  Neither one of us gets angry about it.", "I feel like there's an extreme amount of information missing here. You have headphones on and apparently can't see or hear anything. A shoulder tap is a pretty normal thing to do to get someone's attention in that situation. If he waved his hand in front of your screen I think it would likely be just as startling. How do you want him to get your attention? Have you discussed that with him and told him your preferred way would be, or have you just told him you hate it and you expect him to just not try to get your attention? \n\nIt just feels like there's a lot more to this that you're not giving us.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Split up", "NTA.

You definitely are NOT the ah", "Get a small mirror to put up on the corner of your screen. People who work in cubicles do this all the time. But, hey, he is treating you with contempt. Are you a masochist?", "NTA", "Get an air horn. Do with it what you will. NTA", "NTA I'm a jumpy person and you know what my BF does?

He's just letting you do all the work of telling him so that you're exhausted and you'll just give in or not hold him accountable. \n\nWhat you're displaying is a reflex. And he's damn lucky that you haven't hauled off and smacked the shit out of him. My startle reflex is extremely touchy, and it's a rule in my house and among my friends that I do not tolerate being scared/snuck up on/surprised for shits and giggles.  It makes me feel scared and vulnerable, and nothing feels safe anymore, including the person who does it. Now, if it's accidental, that's fine and it's my job to process and make changes so that I can work through that feeling that I am not safe, and work through fear. \nBut if you decide \"that's silly, and I think you're overreacting\", there's the door. \n\nHe's allowed to say he didn't know once. After that, he's pretending and idk about you, pretending to be stupid so you can avoid accountability isn't that hot.", "NTA- this does not bode well. My ex used to reach out and touch my neck, pretending it was the beginning of a sexy bid for attention even tho I told him one million times I hated it.

I had to use a wheelchair for some of it.", "NTA. The mob has spoken. He is a sadistic, gaslighting abuser, and all communication with him must cease.", "This was my feeling. OP, my husband startled me like an hour ago and immediately apologizes.

Think about your relationship a little.", "Just putting it out there, he may not be startling op on purpose? There is a woman I work with who startles super easy every time I walk into the room, then she gets all pissed off. She drops it but you can feel it for a while afterwards.

Maybe bf is just touching her to get her attention?", "Headphones on so loud you can't hear someone approaching, so focused on the screen that you're \"blind\" to everything around you.

OMG, my shoulder would ache if people just brushed it after days of poke, poke, poke. It is shocking how the little sands of annoyance build up in time.", "I actually had the same issue, painting in bed at night with headphones on, face down in the canvas. I eventually trained my bf to lightly flicker with the ceiling lights carefully so it does not make a clicking noise, since that made me jump too (it does not get dark since I also have aimed lights on the painting). That signals a presence without the jump scare and he can enter the room when I kiss in the air to show him that I saw it.", "my old office configuration made it so my back was to the door and i got jumpscared by every coworker who came in. couldn\u2019t change the layout, so i put a mirror on my desk so i could see people waving at me to get my attention.", "The person being touched and startled gets to say if that not wanted.  All the BF has to do is walk in front of her computer to be noticed.\n\nHe doesn't care what this does to her.  He just likes to startle her.

Wait, no, I have a pretty good idea\u2026.", "The question is has she told him what she would prefer, or has she just basically told him not to bother her even if he needs her attention.\n\nThere's definitely missing info, and that's usually on purpose.", "I mean, I was 5.

He doesn't enjoy it and I certainly don't want any accidents\" so I stopped. \n\nThat's the solution. If you don't like it he has to stop. No questions", "NTA.

But I'm still absolutely blown away by your stance. You think that listening to something with headphones when someone else is around is the *selfish* thing to do?

Or should no one use *any* audio entertainment when someone else is in the house? \n\nAnd as far as a \"give and take\" goes, I feel like \"Please wave your hand in my peripheral vision to get my attention when I'm wearing headphones instead of touching me\" is an extremely reasonable one for her to ask of him.", "Your opinion and your entitled to it but not really the grounds for a long term loving relationship is it\n\nBut maybe that doesn\u2019t matter to you or her or maybe he could book an appointment", "You have insinuated it by blaming her.", "People have different reflexes, some are more sensitive than others.
