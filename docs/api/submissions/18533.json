If he doesnt like how you react then he shouldn\u2019t keep making you jump. You should sit him down and tell him that you hate being startled but what you hate more is his reaction to it because it clearly upsets him and sets the mood for the next few hours.

ANYONE would jump. Anyone. And like you, I'd get mad. I don't like being startled. It takes ZERO EFFORT for him to actually do something to draw your attention before he touches you and frightens you. Instead, he prefers to reverse victim blame and make it your fault that you reacted in a perfectly natural way. \n\n\"Do you get some kind of kick out of making me afraid? Does this get you off? Or do you just like getting in fights? Because I can't understand why you'd get mad at me for a response to stimuli, which is you startling me.\" Might want to look at other behaviors.

I try to avoid it at all costs, writing a message before and ask if I can enter, waiting until he leaves the room etc.\n\nHis behavior here sounds that he doesnt take you serious at all...of course your body's defense mechanism activates before your brain could process a \"well has to be my boyfriend\"", "Welcome to basic gaslighting. It's a classic, really: he does something that upsets you, and when you do get upset, he gets angry at you and claims that you are overreacting. He never has any actual important reason to do that action, he just deliberately does it to upset you. He is training you, to make sure that you will always question your own boundaries and emotional responses, and if given long enough time, he can disrespect and mistreat you left, right and center, and in the end it will always be you who will question your own behaviour.\n\nAt least he is showing his real side early on, and you can ditch his ass before you get stuck too deep. This is why it's important to speak to other women, especially outsiders, so that they can point out the insanity.", "This is red flag behaviour.\n\nBeing startled is not something you can control and he absolutely knows that. But doing it allows him to frighten you and then control you with undeserved guilt.\n\nYou are NTA but he\u2019s a budding abuser. Please get out.", "NTA and he is lucky.

Stopped myself in time, but stormed off. He\u2019s never done it again, and now as hubby makes sure he makes noise so I don\u2019t jump. You are NTA, but your bf is.", "NTA and here's why I think - my partner and I are both survivors of abuse so neither of us do well with being startled. However, she loves to pull pranks and to spook me occasionally - and I like it too. We communicated early on in our relationship about what BOUNDARIES we need to feel comfortable. One of mine was 'hey while I don't mind you doing this sometimes, definitely not all the time and only in this context'. Lol I would have fled if they never listened!", "NTA! I also startle easily and my partner has responded by deliberately making more noise so I can hear him coming.", "Oversimplified brain functioning explanation. The hippocampus takes in signals and directs the input to wherever it needs to go. He touches you, the hippocampus sends the input to the amygdala (threat-processing center) and the prefrontal cortex (logic/reasoning center). The amygdala triggers the fight or flight response before the message even gets to the PFC, so you get a quick shot of adrenaline in case you need to run or fight off the threat. Then the PFC gets the message and you realize it\u2019s your boyfriend, but you still have the adrenaline running around and are ready to fight.\n\nSince fight or flight is triggered before the logic center even gets the message, you literally canNOT know what the threat is yet. The brain is wired to survive first, think later. \n\nHe\u2019s TA, you are NTA.", "I startle very very easily(thanks childhood trauma). I\u2019ve quit friendships because they don\u2019t respect my boundaries or continue to try to provoke a reaction out of me because screaming and dropping to the floor in a panic is \u201cfunny\u201d. Fear of attack, especially from being grabbed from behind with no warning, is ingrained in us as humans and not something to be played with or deliberately fucked with. He\u2019s deliberately scaring you and trying to make you uncomfortable and paranoid in your own home and personal space and then turning it around to make himself the victim when you are upset and scared. \n\nOP, I strongly suggest you think on whether you want to stay with someone who can\u2019t respect your boundaries and is actively trying to create a atmosphere of fear and stress. Your partner should not be the person who is a cause of stress or fear in your life. Very much NTA", "NTA! He sees that you don't like that and he continues. That is not ok! Some people don't like being scared when they are not expecting it and I totally get it! My bf know not to do that to me. If he tries to scare our daughter (she loves it) and scares me instead, I yell at him, curse, cry and he usually gets a slap on the belly to go with it. But he knows I don't like that, he doesn't do it on purpose and he apologizes. Your bf should respect you enough to stop doing that.", "Being startled is a normal reaction.I do this to my wife to get her attention, sometimes as a joke, sometimes just because I need her attention. She does it to me as well. How else are you supposed to get someone\u2019s attention when they have made themselves blind and deaf to the world? If I do it just to startle her, ( which I do sometimes), I could deal with, and expect a little anger, it is a little unreasonable to get angry over someone trying to get your attention. \n\nIf he\u2019s doing it only to startle you, he\u2019s the AH for being upset, at your anger.\nIf he is doing it to get the attention of someone who has made themselves blind and deaf, you\u2019re kind of an AH by getting angry.", "NTA. Everyone's level of nervous sensitivity is different; I know that I'm very easily startled by things that wouldn't necessarily cause other people to jump and squeak and feel their hearts thudding like they just sprinted round the block. And if your bf can't recognise and respect that about you, and be kinder and more thoughtful about how he interacts with you while you're absorbed in another activity, then he deserves to be an ex-bf for sure.", "NTA. I remember a post about a boyfriend who was dumped due to pranks he played on his girlfriend", "Yes, this reminds me of my friend's abusive boyfriend who would, whenever his hands were cold, press them to a sensitive part of her body to startle her. She hated it, asked him to stop, and he never would. He would get mad at her for not finding it funny. Eventually she started having anxiety attacks whenever someone touched her. Little things like these add up.", "Exactly. My ex used to pull shit like this. He would do something that he knew would upset me, I\u2019d get upset (shocker) and tell him what he did was wrong, he would play victim and say that I shouldn\u2019t be mad at him and I\u2019m the one in the wrong and would rile me up until I lost my composure and cried, and then he would try to \u201cconsole\u201d me and say that me being upset \u201cneeded to happen\u201d. I hope OP can see his behaviour for what it is, gaslighting and complete disrespect. He does not give a rats ass about OP\u2019s boundaries.", "People overuse gaslighting but I think this might be the real deal. He's scaring you on purpose and then trying to make you feel crazy for being afraid when that's obviously his objective bc he keeps doing it knowing what's going to happen", "Holy shit. I\u2019m glad you made it out of there safe. <3", "Yeah, that's what I'm wondering too.\n\nIf OP's computer is positioned against a wall, he can't just get into her sightline so she notices him. And she can't hear him. So...that leaves physical contact as a reasonable alternative. \n\nWhat *does* OP want him to do instead?\n\nMind you, if the screen/desk is positioned in a way where he can be in OP's sightline first, that's definitely preferable. But if that isn't possible then I can't blame the guy for going with the next available option.", "If he continues doing things he knows trigger your ptsd, then he is not safe. Simple as that.", "Where does it say the BF is doing it to get her attention on an important matter? It doesn't appear that he's getting her attention for any reasons other than to make her jump.\n\nEdit : in a later comment, OP has told him to wave at her from peripherals and BF refuses to do that. So she set up a perfectly good solution that he won't compromise with. OP is NTA", "Exactly this. Growing up I'd have my dad startle and jump by walking into his room while hes on the PC without even headphones. And his desk was on the pc wall where even his peripheral vision could normally see. \n\nWhen people get that 'blinded' by what they are doing ANYTHING to get their attention will startle them.", "Yeah \"put your desk in a direction where your boyfriend cannot startle and gaslight you\"\nSure\nAre you telling your boyfriend as well, he should do something against getting starled?", "This is absolutely wrong. (Or at least only could apply to the very first time, before she asked him to STOP.)\n\nAre you the boyfriend?\n\nThe alternative is fairly obvious: he waves a hand, calls loudly but pleasantly (yes, you can hear these things through noise-cancelling headphones), and at the very least doesn't *go off* on her for telling him not to touch her unexpectedly. He LISTENS to her and respects her feelings.\n\nIt's not about 'feeling safe' with the boyfriend, it's about suddenly being touched and startled! And, of course, also about the boyfriend being a sadistic jerk in response to a natural response (like ticklers).\n\nOP is NTA.", "I've seen this mentioned another time as well, and I'm sure it's bound to come up again \u2014 sorry, this wasn't something I thought to include. When he waves a hand in my peripherals, I can see him just fine and it doesn't spook me. He knows this, and I've recommended in the past that he just stand next to my desk instead of behind it before he went in to touch me or hug me. I joked it was like approaching a horse, y'know, never from the back and always from the sides. He did it a couple times with success, of course, but then... I don't know, forgot? I don't understand myself.\n\nI agree that how I respond may be too much, I guess. It's not how I *want* to respond; I'd love to be the cutesy girlfriend that giggles and goes \"oh no, you scared meee!\" but I'm not, sadly. And as far as the issue of trust, that's a strange thing to suggest. I've never once feared this man in our whole relationship. I'm just scared because someone is suddenly touching me when the second before that I didn't know someone else was even in the room.", "And rightfully so.", "Yep. And he\u2019s just getting warmed up. This will get a lot worse. OP, please leave this guy. This is truly disturbing behavior.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc9c\n\nI know the term Narcissist is thrown around a lot but I genuinely believe he has NPD, I'm just glad I never have to see him again in all honesty.", "Yeah, and to be fair, the main thing that frustrates him is if I'm having a bad day and I look scared & flinch and shit.\n\n\nI know it's his way of expressing that he's pissed off with my mother having done this to me, so I intellectually process it as protective and clumsy.\n\n\nHe's quite lucky, NGL! I am actually not scared of confrontation, but I WILL get triggered by being shouted at, so in person, I speak like I was raised in a therapy cult or something! Idk I guess my autism makes me take \"be considerate & respectful\" too literally or something! There's no reason for me to escalate something if the emotion behind it is actually something I would like - someone being devastated that I've got fucking PTSD. I know part of my \"Olympic Level Emotional Labour\" shit is conditioning/fear but fuck it, I'd rather not work myself up, have a meltdown and get punched by a policeman for crying again. (And that was in the years before http://stopsim.co.uk)\n\n\nUs fucking \"Borderlines\" are often misdiagnosed autistic women. I have multiple letters from the Personality Disorder specialist team stating I don't meet the criteria but the NHS will do anything to cling to the guidance of withdrawing care, even referring someone three times to a Personality Disorder team while they're begging for autism and ADHD assessments.\n\n\nI went private & got both. I spent 25 years being told \"you're just looking for excuses not to change\"", "The original post never mentioned anything about the BF doing it on purpose. That changes things and I would agree OP is NTA. \n\nTo explain my rationale - as the post reads originally, it\u2019s still unreasonable for the OP to close themselves off from vision and audio and then get upset. It\u2019s unreasonable to think from the first post that it was done deliberately to scare the op. Which is why I initially said ESH.", "OP and anyone really in this situation could see if moving the position of the desk (facing the door for instance). They need to work something out together to find a solution, neither side needs to 'win'.\n\nMy bf and I worked out a system for when I need him, and he's got his headphones on. It wasn't a big deal and works for us.", "Well that definitely changes things, he's a major AH for still touching you if you found a solution. Your reaction isn't over the top then, NTA.\n\nSorry if the trust thing seems strange, I guess it's a really personal thing and everyone feels it differently.\n\nEdit: sorry forgot he's of course also a massive AH for getting angry at you about your reaction, not just that he's startling you in the first place.", "It also didn't mention him ever having a concrete reason for getting her attention. It's not that OP is purposely upset, she gets scared like a reasonable person would, and then told she shouldn't react like that. Knowing someone gets scared when they're touched suddenly means I personally would avoid doing that. If I continued to scare someone knowing there's another option, it makes me an AH 100% of the time."]}
