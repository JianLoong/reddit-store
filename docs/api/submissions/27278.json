Second, not your cousin's birthday, so as a guest, she should sit back and watch the birthday girl, YOU, blow out your own candles.  If pictures aren't being taken of you, then no pictures need to be taken.  It's your party.  You weren't rude.  You were setting boundaries your 42-year-old aunt can't seem to comprehend.
