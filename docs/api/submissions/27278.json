Your aunt sucks lol and so is your family for defending the 42 year old over the 15 year old. I'm a germaphobe so some disgusting 7 year old blowing her spit on my birthday cake would make me go ballistic.. this is your bday not your cousins. Regardless of age - people are allowed to express how they want their birthdays to play out and it should be all about you. She is 7 so her attention from the family is at its peak right now unfortunately.", "The cousin might get heartbroken since her mother is setting up some very unrealistic expectations for her. \n\nShe is just a kid and should be explained how she is not entitled to someone else's birthday cake and encouraged to ask you beforehand if you or any other bday person is ok with the cousin blowing the cake.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for the parent to teach the kids how to manage their emotions when they receive a \"no\" without painting the one who said \"no\" as an evil person.\n\nIt would also be a great opportunity for you to learn to say no in a calm and kind manner.\n\nI'd go with NTA on this one", "Seriously NTA\n\nYour aunt is out of line and being entitled and rude AF trying to push her daughter into the center of YOUR birthday\n\nThey should both be uninvited if that's their behavior", "NTA\n\nYour aunt needs a reality check. She's raising her daughter to be an entitled brat and setting her up for failure. \n\nI recall reading a story on entitled parents once about how OP's younger sibling was absolutely spoiled to the point they'd throw MASSIVE tantrums if they didn't get to blow out candles at another person's party. Like, they could not comprehend or understand that things did not revolve around them.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is being unfair to you, by trying to make your birthday party about your cousin.", "NTA. Happy birthday (and keep aunt and daughter away from your cake, just in case!)", "NTA. She is for hijacking your birthday for her daughter, and to make something that you are allergic to is awful. I would point that to your family that your aunt is more than willing to bring something to the party that you actively can not eat which is beyond rude and going into harmful area.\n\nBut your 15, and the family is pulling the *respect your elders* card. I hope you get the birthday you want.", "Ugh. Pretty sure your aunt is actually 7 years old. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - It's your birthday, she's spoiling her daughter", "Question.. why the hell do you need to ask If YOUR the ah ? The real Question my dear is: how much of an ah is my aunt?", "NTA. \n\nyour birthday, your candles. you don't have to put up with any relative who is trying to undermine your birthday. as for your relatives and cousin, let them know if they think what the aunt was planning is alright, then you will take the liberty to blow our their candles for them.", "NTA and well done for walking away when you got angry rather than letting your weirdo aunt escalate things any further", "NTA: I would have lost my temper too.

It's your birthday and it should be about you. But what makes it ESH is the way you reacted. You're 16th birthday is special because it's the start of adulthood.

Your aunt is and I feel sorry for you.

It's absolutely not necessary for you to share your birthday. Especially not a milestone birthday, and especially not with items around that you're allergic to. Your family is being incredibly rude by even trying to criticize you for walking out.", "NTA, like you said, it's your birthday! I really can't deal with those parents who think everything in the world revolves around their sweet little angels! (A lot of the time they're the only ones who view their kids that way!)", "NTA.  So many things wrong on so many levels.  First, let's start with you are allergic to oranges.  There would be absolutely NO oranges in my house.  Second, not your cousin's birthday, so as a guest, she should sit back and watch the birthday girl, YOU, blow out your own candles.  If pictures aren't being taken of you, then no pictures need to be taken.  It's your party.  You weren't rude.  You were setting boundaries your 42-year-old aunt can't seem to comprehend.  I'd uninvite her and her daughter.", "NTA - what an overreaching and grasping mother - planning on bringing food the birthday girl is allergic to as well as letting her brat of a daughter try to take center stage at Someone Else's Birthday!\n\nJust wow.", "INFO\n\n> She said how she was going to make a bunch of fall related treats such as a bunch of orange flavoured food\n\nWhat the hell do **oranges** have to do with *fall*?", "NTA. Don't invite Aunt & her kid. Your birthday party is about YOU, not entitled people (Aunt is entitled; the kid is innocent, but already being enabled). 16 is a milestone, so you're allowed to enjoy it, & having them & others who side with them will suck the joy out of it.", "NTA, and yes, updates pleases.", "NTA. At this point it may be best to uninvite  them because they will probably just give in", "Also, ITS HER 16TH. Sweet sixteen is a milestone and her family sucks for trying to force her 7 year old cousin into it. And NO WAY, should she have to contend with her food allergies ON HER 16TH BDAY. NTA but everyone else is", "my parents don't bother w me just think im an attention seeker and that its my problem. I am currently working on controlling my anger atm but my aunt especially just pushes me over the edge a lot."]}
