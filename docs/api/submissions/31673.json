{"id": 31673, "submission_id": "1839atn", "title": "AITA for insisting on a hotel next Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (55M) and I (48F) have been together for 2 years. His family always does a huge Thanksgiving.  3 to 4 days of family time with family coming in from around the country.  His family is wonderful and are very happy to welcome my son (8) and I into their traditions. We agreed since Thanksgiving is their big holiday,  we'd spend it with his family out of state and then spend Christmas with my family. Here is where the problem comes in. He ALWAYS stays at his cousins house for the entire weekend. Some family stay at his uncles house and some stay at a hotel. This is my first year joining him out of state and I asked if we could please stay at a hotel as I have social anxiety and I'm allergic to dogs (his cousin has 2). He was not happy and insinuated that I might be an AH for even asking. He says he never asks for anything, and that this is the one thing he won't compromise on. So, I'm here now at his cousins house for night 2. They are very sweet and gracious hosts however, this has been extremely difficult for my anxiety to be tested 24/7.  Also, the dogs are adorable but I can't breath even with my inhaler and Allegra. I asked if next year we could PLEASE compromise and stay at a hotel and it started another fight.  He says I'm being an AH for asking him to give up this tradition.  I even said we could take separate cars and I could go home after 1 day and he can stay for the rest of the weekend but he thinks that would be disrespectful of his family because they want to see me and my son. I think giving up my own family Thanksgiving is enough and a hotel would be a good compromise.

Him not taking that seriously is very upsetting.", "NTA. You're not asking him to spend less time with his family. All you are asking for is a place you can sleep at where you can actually breathe and recover from the social interactions. If you need to head back to the hotel early or for a break, that's very reasonable. He can hang back while you chill for a bit.\n\nHeck, if he wants to sleep at his cousins, go for it.

Why won't he? Because he's getting drunk with his cousin? He can take an Uber back to the hotel nightly if that's an issue and he really wanted to. \n\nPlease look at this and see if he deprioritizes you in other ways.", "I had to tell someone they couldn't ride with me because they wear perfume and I'm allergic. She was incredibly kind about it. Just like your man should have been.", "NTA. It\u2019s not reasonable to ask you to stay in a house with dogs if you are severely allergic. Could you and your son stay in a hotel while he stays with the cousin, so he doesn\u2019t have to \u201cgive up the tradition\u201d? Also, it seems like his family would understand if you explain the situation - they seem like good people, and you said that some other family members stay at hotels, so I don\u2019t see why they would be upset about you doing the same.", "NTA, you gave him a very reasonable option to still partake in this tradition w/o having to suffer through an allergy and anxiety filled with weekend.", "NTA Your boyfriend is being ridiculous. He can go alone next year.", "You are NTA. He is, for expecting you to have asthma attacks as proof of your \"respect\" for his family. If this family expects you to endure this as a sign of respect for them then none of them deserve your respect!\n\nAlso, please don't end up in the hospital. If your inhaler isn't working then you probably should go to a hotel, even if he disapproves.", "NTA. MY spouse was overwhelmed by my large closely knit Catholic family. Had he asked to stay at a hotel I would have been offended but the allergies make a difference.", "NTA Your bf isn\u2019t being reasonable or taking your allergies and social anxiety seriously.

He's not taking your health seriously at all, is he. Does he always disregard your needs?  Or is this just a one-time incident? I'd be concerned if it were me. As in very concerned. \n\nNTA, but your BF certainly is.", "NTA... you are making yourself sick to please your bf? Nope. But suggest he go on his own and start your own Thanksgiving tradition.  Or go and stay in a hotel and enjoy a good nights sleep and less commotion.", "NTA explain to the cousins and stay at the hotel.  You don\u2019t need his permission to book a hotel.", "NTA.\n\nYou want to be there, they want you to be there.  But you have conditions that make it extremely difficult.

Lovely hosts don't make allergies go away.

There is no reason for you to suffer unnecessarily with anxiety and allergies. \n\nYour boyfriend is free to stay with you or stay at his cousins'. His choice. You aren't asking him to spend less time with his family.  You just aren't and shouldn't have to suffer for it.", "So, you are in a group of people, you have trouble breathing even while taking medicine and using an inhaler, and nobody asks what is going on?

Not everyone can just DEAL with their allergies, from personal experience it's hard!! I'm allergic to cats and I have 4, I deal with it cause I love them but even I need a break sometimes", "NTA. What else is he rigidly inflexible about? Money?  Take your son and go to a hotel while he stays with his cousin. Explain why to his family - you are having trouble breathing because of your dog allergy. His reaction will tell you whether you should continue in the relationship or not.", "I have similar allergies to dogs and cats and the symptoms are no joke. I'm sorry to say it, but this is a really big red flag. Please rethink your commitment to this person who takes your health so lightly.", "Thank you. I have told him this. I am fine with him sleeping at his cousins,  especially if they've been drinking, I just don't want to sleep there.", ">Why does he get to decide where you sleep?\n\nOP, you are a grown-ass adult and a parent. You go right on and sleep where you are most comfortable. If/when bf calms down, try to figure out the root cause of his stand. I don\u2019t think it's for the reasons he's giving you, because the host would not care, as you've said. It's a little bizarre he is dismissing your comfort and health for... what? Control? NTA.", "Right!? His family is so nice, they definitely wouldn't judge.", "This is me. You cant escape it if it's in the car. I'm always trying to find the kindest way to explain.", "Exactly! I have suggested this, but he wants us all together.  I definitely don't want him to miss out on his family time,  I just need a place to escape for a while.", "Seriously. Sounds like it\u2019s either hotel or hospital and hotels are much less expensive and generally more pleasant.", "If he has a problem with this very reasonable solution, then he has a problem. NTA", "Why don't you and your son just move to a hotel for the rest of the trip? Politely explain to the cousin that, while you very much appreciate the hospitality, your allergy to the dogs is simply making it too hard for you to breathe. If your bf gets upset, let him. If he stays upset, please reconsider if you want to be with someone who doesn't care if you can breathe.", "Then there you go", "But hubby isn\u2019t allergic to dogs, so it\u2019s tough titties what he wants. If he wants the family to all be together, then you can all be together at a hotel. \nOr you and your son can stay at a hotel and he can stay with family and not be a baby about it. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about your health at all", "So what if he wants that?  Can you do it anyway?", "Looks like this issue needs to be handled before planning the trip itself (next year on)\u2026. Call the cousins to confirm they still have dogs in the house, make reservations at a hotel for you & your son. Just like he insists his tradition won\u2019t change, you can put your foot down too because your allergies don\u2019t change either!

A lot of them read like, \"AITA for asking my partner to put my health first?\" \"AITA for telling someone no and putting my health/safety/needs first?\" \"AITA for setting boundaries?\" \"AITA for asking my partner to be supportive of a need I have.\" I am so glad this sub exists so people can be validated that it's OK to put their health, safety, emotional well being, children, and boundaries first in their lives!  \n\n\nNTA - your health matters! Your comfort matters! And you should be with a partner that can get behind that. I hope that your BF comes around.", "How could it possibly be construed as disrespectful for a person who is allergic to dogs not to stay in a home with dogs?\n\nI think your BF is not only extremely inconsiderate of your needs, but he's bullshitting you on the disrespect of family issue.  You have social anxiety & you're allergic to dogs; that's not disrespectful.\n\nThe fact is, he wants what he wants and your health and well-being be damned.\n\nYou aren't being an A; he is. \n\nYou don't compromise on your beloved's health and well being; you graciously take care of their completely legitimate needs. \n\nRefuse to stay in a house with dogs.  No compromise with your health. And maybe take this man to a couples' counselor ASAP to explore his very unreasonable demands and irrational anger.  It isn't pretty and it's not something you should have to live with.\n\nNTA", "Your mental and physical health should not be compromised, NTA.  I suggest taking some time to think, is this the man you want to so pens your life with?", "NTA Presumably you have asthma since you have an inhaler and the dogs set it off.  I have asthma and unless you turn blue and wheeze people assume you're fine.  But I can be struggling and my oxygen level way below normal and look just fine.\nEvery time you have an asthma attack your lungs are damaged a little.  Don't put up with this BS from your boyfriend or anyone else who doesn't care that you CAN'T FUCKING BREATHE properly. \nOn a separate note I am allergic to every inhalent there is: grasses, molds, cockroaches, cats, dogs, trees, weeds etc.  I have moderate/severe asthma.  Getting allergy shots helped me a lot, but it took at least 6 months to really notice.  So if you have insurance that's something to think about.  We tend to become less triggered by pets we're around more so I have cats and I am ok with them but when I go to the vet's office I'm miserable (mask does help a lot though).", "Prolonged exposure to the dogs = can\u2019t breathe.

That's a red flag so big you can use it as a tent.", "NTA\n\nOnce the holiday stress is over talk to him about the anxiety and allergies and tell him that you'd be okay if he went to the cousins but you will be with your son in a nearby hotel if he chooses not to join you. Your health is just so much more important than a tradition. Also maybe talk to his family about it while you're there so they can help him see your side of it???", "You can either stay at a hotel while he stays at his cousin's, or you can not go at all. If neither of these options are good enough for your BF when this is clearly a mental and physical health issue for you, then Thanksgiving seems to me to not be the problem.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - he does not get to inflict harm in you for his own benefit / preference  - that\u2019s simply  not how healthy relationships work. You have proposed a workable alternative now stick to it. If after proper discussion he insists his family tradition and you being by his side rather than in a hotel to sleep is more important than your mental and physical health- well then, you\u2019ve seen who he really is and you can almost certainly do better.", "Believe me, OP, your hosts would be totally happy to have one fewer house guest to worry about and feed!\n\nNow seriously, the fact that you're allergic to dogs gave you a medical excuse to get a hotel room for yourself. That's one of the things I love about the modern era, the fact that anyone can reserve a hotel room on the phone they carry everywhere, and believe me your hosts would SO not be offended if you'd gotten yourself a room, given apologies for changing arrangements and explained the situation, and spent the night elsewhere. Because believe me, no matter what your BF says, your hosts are happy to have one less breakfast to cook, and no worries about a guest having a medical emergency.", "Why are you asking him?  Tell him you are getting a hotel and it\u2019s his decision whether he stays there with you or at the house, you are fine either way.", "My wife and I were in a very similar predicament some years ago except it was me with the social anxiety.  I stayed in a local hotel while she stayed with the parents, siblings, and in-laws.  I'd come by mid morning everyday and enjoy the day with them and then 'retreat' to my hotel room for peace an quiet.  Were their questions?  Of course but my wife eventually conceded it was better for my own mental health.", "NTA but I have to ask what kind of a person did you marry who disregards your health issues? Does he just view you as a possession/accessory?", "NTA for wanting a hotel, but for heavens sake, you\u2019re 48 years old and you have to ask if you\u2019re being an a-hole for not wanting to spend two days unable to breathe?", "NTA. Or better yet, next year get yourself a new boyfriend actually respects your boundaries.", "The reason I feel guilty is because he really is great and kind and considerate for the rest of the year. I can't figure out why this weekend he acts differently.", "No, that's why this is so confusing.  I can't figure out why this seemingly simple request is causing such a hard time for him.", "I am definitely considering couples therapy.", "Question. \n\nHow has his family reacted to you not being able to breathe and need meds and inhaler for days? \n\nHave they ever shown some concern?", "My question is, if a friend were having the same exact issue: Significant other does not respect their discomfort and potentially FATAL allergies to the point of arguments and yelling, what would you tell them to do? \n\nEven if he's great the rest of the year, he doesn't respect you enough to allow you to sleep in a space you can BREATHE in. Please look back on your relationship with as if it was one of your friend's relationship.", "*is* a problem"]}
