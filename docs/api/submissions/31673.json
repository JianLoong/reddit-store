{"id": 31673, "submission_id": "1839atn", "title": "AITA for insisting on a hotel next Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (55M) and I (48F) have been together for 2 years. His family always does a huge Thanksgiving.  3 to 4 days of family time with family coming in from around the country.  His family is wonderful and are very happy to welcome my son (8) and I into their traditions. We agreed since Thanksgiving is their big holiday,  we'd spend it with his family out of state and then spend Christmas with my family. Here is where the problem comes in. He ALWAYS stays at his cousins house for the entire weekend. Some family stay at his uncles house and some stay at a hotel. This is my first year joining him out of state and I asked if we could please stay at a hotel as I have social anxiety and I'm allergic to dogs (his cousin has 2). He was not happy and insinuated that I might be an AH for even asking. He says he never asks for anything, and that this is the one thing he won't compromise on. So, I'm here now at his cousins house for night 2. They are very sweet and gracious hosts however, this has been extremely difficult for my anxiety to be tested 24/7.  Also, the dogs are adorable but I can't breath even with my inhaler and Allegra. I asked if next year we could PLEASE compromise and stay at a hotel and it started another fight.  He says I'm being an AH for asking him to give up this tradition.  I even said we could take separate cars and I could go home after 1 day and he can stay for the rest of the weekend but he thinks that would be disrespectful of his family because they want to see me and my son. I think giving up my own family Thanksgiving is enough and a hotel would be a good compromise.

Him not taking that seriously is very upsetting.", "NTA. You're not asking him to spend less time with his family. All you are asking for is a place you can sleep at where you can actually breathe and recover from the social interactions. If you need to head back to the hotel early or for a break, that's very reasonable. He can hang back while you chill for a bit.\n\nHeck, if he wants to sleep at his cousins, go for it. Why does he get to decide where you sleep?", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is. It\u2019s absurd that he wants to you struggle to breathe when half of the family is staying at a hotel anyway?! It wouldn\u2019t even be weird or unusual for you to do!", "NTA\n\nFrankly, I'm of the opinion that \"crash at your cousin's for the holidays\" is shit you should only be getting away with when you're in your 20s or something.\n\nBut that **doesn't even matter** here:\n\n> I'm allergic to dogs (his cousin has 2)\n\n**Open** and **shut**.", "Definitely NTA, let him stay at the relatives, you and your son get a hotel room at the same place as the other relatives for your health.", "NTA. This is a health issue (mental and physical). If your boyfriend cannot understand that, and is not open to any kind of compromise, then there are deeper problems here.", "NTA\nYou're expecting a grown man to compromise on a very reasonable thing because of a serious health issue and he won't. Why won't he? Because he's getting drunk with his cousin? He can take an Uber back to the hotel nightly if that's an issue and he really wanted to. \n\nPlease look at this and see if he deprioritizes you in other ways.", "I had to tell someone they couldn't ride with me because they wear perfume and I'm allergic. She was incredibly kind about it. Just like your man should have been.", "NTA. It\u2019s not reasonable to ask you to stay in a house with dogs if you are severely allergic. Could you and your son stay in a hotel while he stays with the cousin, so he doesn\u2019t have to \u201cgive up the tradition\u201d? Also, it seems like his family would understand if you explain the situation - they seem like good people, and you said that some other family members stay at hotels, so I don\u2019t see why they would be upset about you doing the same.", "NTA, you gave him a very reasonable option to still partake in this tradition w/o having to suffer through an allergy and anxiety filled with weekend.", "NTA Your boyfriend is being ridiculous. He can go alone next year.", "You are NTA. He is, for expecting you to have asthma attacks as proof of your \"respect\" for his family. If this family expects you to endure this as a sign of respect for them then none of them deserve your respect!\n\nAlso, please don't end up in the hospital. If your inhaler isn't working then you probably should go to a hotel, even if he disapproves.", "NTA. MY spouse was overwhelmed by my large closely knit Catholic family. Had he asked to stay at a hotel I would have been offended but the allergies make a difference.", "NTA Your bf isn\u2019t being reasonable or taking your allergies and social anxiety seriously. I hate that he\u2019s selfishly discounting your feelings. You\u2019ve given him very reasonable options. If he\u2019s not willing to compromise and work with you, I don\u2019t know.", "Wow! He's not taking your health seriously at all, is he. Does he always disregard your needs?  Or is this just a one-time incident? I'd be concerned if it were me. As in very concerned. \n\nNTA, but your BF certainly is.", "NTA... you are making yourself sick to please your bf? Nope. But suggest he go on his own and start your own Thanksgiving tradition.  Or go and stay in a hotel and enjoy a good nights sleep and less commotion.", "NTA explain to the cousins and stay at the hotel.  You don\u2019t need his permission to book a hotel.", "NTA.\n\nYou want to be there, they want you to be there.  But you have conditions that make it extremely difficult.  You aren\u2019t asking him to skip, just allow you to handle what you can.  Your husband should be supporting you.", "You. Are. Miserable. What part of allergies doesn't he get?! Lovely hosts don't make allergies go away. NTA.", "nta - but your boyfriend is,\n\nhuge red flag, are there others?", "NTA. \n\nSince your boyfriend isn't willing to compromise, *you* stay at a hotel next year. There is no reason for you to suffer unnecessarily with anxiety and allergies. \n\nYour boyfriend is free to stay with you or stay at his cousins'. His choice. You aren't asking him to spend less time with his family.  You just aren't and shouldn't have to suffer for it.", "So, you are in a group of people, you have trouble breathing even while taking medicine and using an inhaler, and nobody asks what is going on? And this is even without the social anxiety...\n\nSince it isn't just him anymore, it is time for him to accept new traditions, you wouldn't even be the only ones in a hotel.\n\nGuess what would happen if your inhaler doesn't work at all, the first thing any healthcare provider would scold you for staying at a place with dogs and to get the F away from them.\n\nYou may be his Girlfriend, but it doesn't sound like he loves you that much. and think about your son, what would he do if you had to spend the night in a hospital...\n\nWhere health is concerned, you take care or #1, He apparently doesn't care too much.", "NTA\n\n**\"I'm allergic to dogs (his cousin has 2\"**\n\nYeah, your boyfriend has the audacity to call you an A H for not wanting to stay multiple days at a house where are dogs and you're allergic.

Not everyone can just DEAL with their allergies, from personal experience it's hard!! I'm allergic to cats and I have 4, I deal with it cause I love them but even I need a break sometimes", "NTA. What else is he rigidly inflexible about? Money?  Take your son and go to a hotel while he stays with his cousin. Explain why to his family - you are having trouble breathing because of your dog allergy. His reaction will tell you whether you should continue in the relationship or not.", "I have similar allergies to dogs and cats and the symptoms are no joke. I'm sorry to say it, but this is a really big red flag. Please rethink your commitment to this person who takes your health so lightly.", "Thank you. I have told him this. I am fine with him sleeping at his cousins,  especially if they've been drinking, I just don't want to sleep there.", ">Why does he get to decide where you sleep?\n\nOP, you are a grown-ass adult and a parent. You go right on and sleep where you are most comfortable. If/when bf calms down, try to figure out the root cause of his stand. I don\u2019t think it's for the reasons he's giving you, because the host would not care, as you've said. It's a little bizarre he is dismissing your comfort and health for... what? Control? NTA.", "Right!? His family is so nice, they definitely wouldn't judge.", "This is me. You cant escape it if it's in the car. I'm always trying to find the kindest way to explain.", "Exactly! I have suggested this, but he wants us all together.  I definitely don't want him to miss out on his family time,  I just need a place to escape for a while.", "Seriously. Sounds like it\u2019s either hotel or hospital and hotels are much less expensive and generally more pleasant.", "If he has a problem with this very reasonable solution, then he has a problem. NTA", "Why don't you and your son just move to a hotel for the rest of the trip? Politely explain to the cousin that, while you very much appreciate the hospitality, your allergy to the dogs is simply making it too hard for you to breathe. If your bf gets upset, let him. If he stays upset, please reconsider if you want to be with someone who doesn't care if you can breathe.", "Then there you go", "But hubby isn\u2019t allergic to dogs, so it\u2019s tough titties what he wants. If he wants the family to all be together, then you can all be together at a hotel. \nOr you and your son can stay at a hotel and he can stay with family and not be a baby about it. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about your health at all", "So what if he wants that?  Can you do it anyway?", "Looks like this issue needs to be handled before planning the trip itself (next year on)\u2026. Call the cousins to confirm they still have dogs in the house, make reservations at a hotel for you & your son. Just like he insists his tradition won\u2019t change, you can put your foot down too because your allergies don\u2019t change either! NTA", "I'm always so amazed at some of the AITA questions that I see on here. A lot of them read like, \"AITA for asking my partner to put my health first?\" \"AITA for telling someone no and putting my health/safety/needs first?\" \"AITA for setting boundaries?\" \"AITA for asking my partner to be supportive of a need I have.\" I am so glad this sub exists so people can be validated that it's OK to put their health, safety, emotional well being, children, and boundaries first in their lives!  \n\n\nNTA - your health matters! Your comfort matters! And you should be with a partner that can get behind that. I hope that your BF comes around."]}
