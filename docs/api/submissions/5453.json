The first time i told him i don\u2019t eat pork he was understandable.

My MIL decided she was going to make a juicy roasted pork dish and proudly presented it to the family. She started cutting the meat and placing it on everyone\u2019s plate. I told her, When she came up to my plate , that i don\u2019t eat pork and she insisted that i try some and it\u2019ll change my whole opinion on the meat. I told her again that i don\u2019t eat pork and the reaction it\u2019ll have on me might cause me to throw up as my body won\u2019t react to it properly. I know she felt irritated as she grabbed my cutlery and tried to force feed me the pork. My husband had to step in and my MIL accused me of stealing her son and ruining his birthday by \nbeing selfish.\n\nSince then she\u2019s been around my house 24/7 cooking dishes that all have pork in them and afraid that i\u2019m not going to look at my plate properly and eat pork. So far i\u2019ve been giving my husband all portions of my mil dinner but the scent itself makes me feel nauseous that i\u2019ve thrown up once but my MIL is saying it\u2019s a positive sign.\n\ni know i could\u2019ve settled this by eating the meat but i\u2019ve lasted 24 years without eating pork and i don\u2019t want to stop it because my MIL insists that it\u2019s good for me.\nYesterday i overheard my MIL saying that each dish for christmas should only contain pork so i told my husband and suggested we go to my family for christmas and he agreed but my MIL said i was stealing her son from her and she only wants the best for me.\nTruly, AITA?\nSorry this post is so long just want to get my point across.", "created_utc": 1671791923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztc9qp/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_my_mil_pork_dish/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your MIL sounds like a nightmare and you have a husband problem.  He needs to step in NOW and let his mother know that if this continues there will be very low to no contact for the foreseeable future.", "NTA\n\n\nTime to get your husband on board with this.\n\n\nYour MIL is no longer welcome in your house if she's going to bring pork with her.\n\n\nI'm a carnivore and love all the meats. However, I would never make someone eat anything they don't want to, no matter what it was. \n\n\nYou're an adult and are more than capable of making your own decisions. Relating to food and to who is welcome in your house.\n\n\nIt's such a weird hill for your MIL to want to die on. Is she actually a pig farmer, is that the bit your missing out?! Why would she CARE!! There are other things she can eat if she wants to cook stuff for her son. So many other things. Weird.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. it's not about the pork or food, it's about MIL wanting to control over their lives. she wants submissiveness. today it's pork that OP is being forced to eat, tomorrow OP will be subjected to another demand armed with the phrase \"stealing her son away\" along with the crocodile tears.", "NTA but how long are you going to put up with this from her? In many instances It's YOUR house that she's coming around and cooking pork in. She's doing it deliberately. There  is zero reason to even open the door to your house for her at this point and if your husband doesn't back you up on going low or no contact with his mom over this, you also have a husband problem. Set boundaries. Stick to them. \n\nWhen you go to her house (if you do) bring your own food every single time.", "From your story I understand that your MIL is now staying in your house. That she cooks pork there every day and tries to force you to eat it. Anyway NTA for not eating pork.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition, if it is indeed your house, you can simply impose rules on MIL such as: no pork in the house.", "Reading all these Reddit post I can't believe how lucky I am with my in laws. My biggest issue with my MIL is that she bakes so many cakes we're gaining weight. \nOf course you're NTA. Force feeding you?????!!! I don't think I could've kept any semblance of civility at that point. Verbally pushing to make me eat it - ok, rude, but I can take it for family piece. But anyone coming at my grown a** self with a darn fork, trying to force food into my mouth?! They'd be out of my house with some broken fingers in a moment. \nAlso, why is she at your house, cooking after this incident? Why is she let in? Why is your husband taking all this?\nI suspect there are some cultural differences here that are very different from what's common in my neck of the woods, but around here if my MIL was showing any amount of this behavior and my husband was not throwing her out, I'd be kicking both of them out. This is just apalling. It doesn't matter why you don't eat pork, whether you get sick from it or simply don't want to, you're an adult. You can decide what you want to eat. NOBODY should ever tell you what to eat, especially demanding.\nPlease don't eat absolutely anything with her around, it's 100 percent sure that she will put pork into something you don't suspect. She's disrespectful, rude, controlling and just plain disgusting. You must set boundaries now, or she'll do the same with kids you might have later.", "NTA. Please don't let this woman guilt you into eating something you don't like. I don't eat meat and I have had people do this to me countless times.

It's a good thing your husband is on your side.\n\nedited:- to fix typos :)", "NTA ~ You told her you don\u2019t eat pork and she should respect that. Everyone has different dietary preferences and it sounds like you were very respectful when you told her you didn\u2019t eat it. \n         I would hope that your husband sticks up for you when it comes to your MIL but it may be hard for him to do that since it is his mom. \n       Ultimately if I were you I would just sit down and maybe explain to him how you\u2019re feeling or if you\u2019re up for it maybe even explain to your MIL why you don\u2019t eat pork and how it makes you feel when she try\u2019s and forces it on you.", "NTA. Your MIL is stubborn. If you don\u2019t want to eat pork it\u2019s that simple I have no idea why she won\u2019t respect your decision.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, you set a boundary and your MIL is trying to force her way passed it, props on your husband though for sticking by your side", "NTA\n\nYour MIL need to respect your diet, whatever it is, for whatever reason. She should not be attempting to change your diet. It's none of her concern.\n\nHer reactions are telling. She is blaming you for the rift she is creating by trying to force you to eat pork. Sounds like so many red flags. What is important is that your husband sounds like he is supportive, not buying into her bs, which is great. But don't let her make you feel like you are the one being the asshole for not doing whatever she wants.\n\nShe is TA", "NTA.  But it's kind of sad that your husband isn't sticking up for you.  This is not really your conflict.  Your husband should be telling his mom to knock it off.", "NTA, your mother in law sounds toxic as hell,  constantly accusing you of straggling her son is messed up.  Your husband needs to put his big boy pants on and tell her to stop!", "NTA I don't eat pork often for health reasons, it's very common for people who have had their gall bladder removed or have gall bladder attacks.  There are probably other health reasons.  Your mil is out of line", "NTA. Why are you allowing her to overstep your boundaries ? She is abusive and harassing you, why don\u2019t you see it ? And, in your own home, that too !", "NTA\n\nNobody has the right to decide what you eat. \n\nShame on her for trying to force you to try something you don\u2019t want to indulge in. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ask, another altogether to try and force feed and manipulate and that\u2019s what your MIL is doing. \n\nGood of your husband to stand by you.", "NTA. She has control issues and mommy issues. Your husband needs to stop this immediately. He needs to tell her if she doesn\u2019t stop harassing you and trying to change you or police what you eat she needs to leave immediately. 100% do not spend Christmas with this woman. Get her all the way out of your home.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds really controlling and can't seem to bare her son being married. Really messed up that she even cooks pork at your house, so disrespectful.\n\nThink your husband needs to tell her to stop being an idiot and get over herself.", "Absolutely NTA. Your MIL bullies you and tries to force you into eating something that you don't want, that's abuse plain and simple. Why doesn't your husband stand up for you? Why does she decide what is cooked in your household? Leave that place with or without him.", "NTA but you did post this a while back, and you\u2019ve twice been kind of offensive with the \u201cI\u2019m not Muslim where it\u2019s haram\u201d line\u2014you can just state your religion or leave it out entirely.\n\nAlso what kind of MIL revenge cooks pork every single day? Throw her out of your house, yeesh.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nWhether it's for health, ethical, religious, cultural, traditional reasons... it doesn't matter. You have chosen not to eat pork, and **your choice must be respected**. Your MIL is being extremely disrespectful to you, and she is trying to manipulate you and your husband by crying. She has started a battle against you and will not be satisfied until she sees you capitulate, stating that she's still the most important person in her son's life.\r  \n\r  \nMy advice is to step aside and let your husband handle the relationship with his mother. He's the one who has to set boundaries and demand that MIL respect his wife.", "She's vindictive and spiteful.", "nta but she sure is...you have every right to decide what you do and do not consume and nobody should force you to try pork of you don't want it...stand your ground and let her know if she can't respect your decisions she isn't welcomed at your home anymore.", "NTA. She is a bully. Hubby should ban her from your house and make it clear she is not welcome until she drops this. I fear one day she will sneek pork into a meal. She is the selfish one.", "i have never understood why anyone cares about what someone else does or doesn't want to eat.\n\ni've gone out to dinner with people and only ordered cole slaw & bread because that's what i was in the mood for and you would have thought i spit in their food then slapped them across the face.\n\nwhy do people care about shit like this?!?!\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nI don't understand why your MIL is Soo obsessed with pork at the point of making your life a living hell just because you choosed not to eat that. I am glad your husband is on board and supporting you tho", "NTA but maybe you wanna take a look into r/JUSTNOMIL there are many people that experience similar troubles with their MIL and maybe it helps you a bit to talk to people in similar situations :) \n\nBut you are definitely NTA. I wish your MIL would accept, that this is the way you were raised and it is nothing wrong about it. It would be the same if you were vegan by choice and she would repeatedly disrespect your bodily autonomy.\n\nBut why is she still at your house? tell her to leave your house or accept and respect your food choices. And maybe talk w your hubby about consequences for her like LC or VLC. \n\nI wish you all the best and hope you have a wonderful christmas where you can eat what you want without having to fear if there is pork :)", "NTA\n\nI would be livid.  I was vegetarian for years.  People always tried to sneak meat in my fucking food and it pissed me off to no end.  Why do people think it's okay to force food on others???  Some assholes actually get off on doing it.  They're fucking sick.\n\nIf I were you, I'd flat out tell her to stop putting pork in your dishes or you're actually going to steal her son away, by making him go no contact with her.  You can't trust her and you and your husband are a team.  If you don't trust her, he doesn't either.  Which does she actually want to keep in her son's good graces or feed you pork.  Those are her only options.  She can choose whichever makes her happy, but if she chooses her son and still tries to sneak pork into your food, she's still losing her son.", "NTA Your MIL is. How dare she try to force feed you AND pretty much move into your house and keep cooking food you don\u2019t eat and the smell makes you sick ? She\u2019s abusive and I\u2019d either go N/C or find a food that offends her and repeatedly do the same to her.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a MIL problem. You have a SO problem. He needs to stand up to his mother and set some boundaries. His mother, his responsibility to handle this situation as well as her irrational desire to be the main woman in his life. She doesn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for you. She wants to exert control. Do not let her gaslight you. If your SO can\u2019t grow a backbone then you need to decide if this relationship is worth it in the long run. MIL like her can make life a living hell when they are allowed to trample all over everything and everyone.", "The funny thing is, that the not eating pork rule some religons have are just \"normal\" rules from a time where it was easier to tell the crowd \"and xy said you shall not eat pork\" than trying to explain them why some meat is more likely to be / get bad. There could have been a virus involved at some point or it could just have been harder hygienewise and pork was declared as unsafe and to avoid ppl dying from it they embedded it in the religion. As far as i know pork is really dangerous when bad.", "NTA", "NTA. While you are in my opinion missing out on a lot of delicious food by not eating pork, it's still your choice.
