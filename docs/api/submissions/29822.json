One boy(4) and one girl(2). Wife has been at home since my oldest was born. We have my one income which has been stressful but we manage.\n\nWife has battled depression and anxiety even before the kids were born but she takes medication to help. It gets hard some days because it effects our marriage and the kids but I\u2019ll get into that more soon. Before kids my wife loved to sleep. Sometimes 10-12 hours a day on a normal day. As much  as I tried to tell her she could thrive on 7-8 it went on deaf ears.\n\nFast forward to having kids. We all know having kids is tough. Most nights and days it was broken. It was also an adjustment to her staying home with no job and I leaving to go to work myself. She no longer got the extra sleep she was used to. I went above and beyond to help her get sleep outside of my work schedule. Let her sleep on the weekends or sleep when I got home etc.\n\nWe then just started to co exist. Sleeping separately. No physical what so ever. Rarely had meaningful talks. It\u2019s just became treading water until the next sleep. Not to mention her immune system hasnt always been great and she would take a lot of sick leave when she worked. She lost touch with me, her friends(she doesn\u2019t like going out much since kids). Shes become a homebody. She is also a master of mirroring my emotions. It\u2019s her defense mechanism. If I\u2019m angry she\u2019s angry. If I\u2019m quiet she\u2019s quiet. It is a very tough thing to navigate on top of everything else.\n\nI started to refuse to take off days to help her with stuff at home(sick kids with no fever/when she wouldn\u2019t get sleep herself). She will even ask me to play hookie but that leads to me watching kids and her sleeping. I come home to a dirty house every night. She hasn\u2019t cooked in a long time. I rarely get any appreciation and it\u2019s become more expected. Her sleep now is 12-14 hours a day with night and day sleep.\n\nLuckily for her, my kids sleep through the night and take great naps during the day. But unlucky for me I have to pick up the slack. She stopped taking our kids out in public so I do that when I get home. I take them to parks and my moms to help. But I\u2019m Exausted. I work from 730-430. Come home. Take kids out, feed them, clean the house up and go to sleep myself. Rinse and repeat the next day. The hardest part is she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m doing enough. If I dont drop my work to come help her she gets upset.\n\nI absolutely love my wife. I put up boundaries this year and it\u2019s been incredibly tough. I don\u2019t take days off anymore unless it\u2019s serious. I\u2019m Overworked and extremely tired of holding the entire burden of my family and I get absolute grief for it.

Your wife needs mental health support and she should also see her PCP to see if there's any physical issues that are making things worse. It's not sustainable or fair to you (or the kids) if you have to carry the entire family.", "NTA but I think your wife needs professional help. Sleeping 14 hours a day is not sustainable with two young children.", "NAH. \n\nYou are extremely overburdened and are just expecting your partner to share the load. However, from the way that you've explained her situation, sleeping for 10-12 hours and having bad immune system sounds like medical concerns rather than psychological or mindset issues. So I won't comment on her behaviour.   \n\n\nBut to answer your question, no, you aren't the asshole to expect those things from your partner. The load should be shared equally. That's how relationships and marriages work.   \n\n\nP.S. From personal experience, my wife was having similar symptoms (extremely sleepy, feeling tired and fatigued all the time, borderline depression and anxiety - basically all that you mentioned) and was later diagnosed with pernicious anaemia, caused by deficiency of Vitamin B12. Perhaps get her checked?", "NTA she needs to get her thyroid levels checked. When mine decided to stop working all I wanted to do was sleep. Had absolutely no energy", "NAH. If your wife has depression and anxiety, chances are she doesn't \"love to sleep\" - it's very common for people with mental health problems to massively over or under sleep. When I was at my lowest, sleeping was the only thing I could motivate myself to do. I just wanted the days to waste away. It sounds like your wife is struggling a great deal mentally. Having a baby can make this even worse, she might have post partum on top of the issues she was already dealing with. The two of you need support - you can't skip work to take care of the kids all the time and she can't sleep the days away and leave them to fend for themselves until you get home. Can you afford a nanny, even to help out once or twice a week while your wife gets support for her mental health?", "NAH.  This is such a tough situation and I feel like the two of you need a \"re-set\".  You guys might want to sit down and really talk about all of this, not to resolve, but just to get it all out there.  Who is mad at what, so to speak.  Make a list.  And then start at the beginning.  Your wife needs a full physical that you should attend, just to ensure the doctor is getting the full picture.  Then she needs a therapist of her own in addition to your couples sessions.  It really sounds like she has some physical and mental health things going on at the same time and it's all contributing.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. It sounds like your wife's medication needs to be adjusted. That's a lot of sleep and sounds like depression is still gripping her.", "NTA. You're doing your best in a very difficult and unstable time. I feel your wife feels that she is also doing her best but may be slightly selfish when it comes to stating that you don't do enough. \n\nI'm a desperate sleeper myself but you learn to live with not sleeping when you have kids and SAH responsibilities. It seems like she doesnt want to adjust her schedule to make it easier for the both of you. A small but serious talk about that should work a little to kinda get her head where your heads at. \n\nBut all in all, NTA. Your feelings are valid. Not to talk smack about your wife, but she's gotta grow up a little and learn to appreciate all that you do and what she should do to help your family out more.", "NTA - I have been experiencing fatigue for almost 20 years as a result of chronic pain, medication and a mind that goes a million miles an hour. \n\nYour wife needs help. \n\nI have a hobby-based business and have just taken up 2 hours of sports coaching a week.\n\nDuring the day my schedule looks like this:\n8am - wake\n8:45 - kids are at school\n9:30-11:30 sleep\n11:30 - 3:20 cleaning, meal prep, shopping\n3:30 school pickup\n4:00pm extra-curricular activities \n5:30 dinner prep\n6-6:30 dinner\n7 dishes sorted, kitchen clean\n7:30 TV time\n12:00pm bed\n\nAs you can see I still get 10 hours, sometimes 11 either with a morning nap or an afternoon nap.\n\nMy husband\u2019s duties on top of FT work are walking the dog daily, mowing the lawns fortnightly and dinner once per week. \n\nYour wife owes it to herself, her children and to you to get on top of this.", "This sounds like a thyroid issue to be honest. I've been through the same. Medication was life changing", "NTA but she needs more professional help. This is not safe or healthy for the kids. I would consider in patient therapy and maybe a physical evaluation to make sure she\u2019s physically healthy as well.", "She obviously has depression and needs help to get out of it, you seem to be helping as much as possible but only therepy can really get her out of this slump.", "Nta. I agree with others that she needs a medical evaluation.  Also you both have a job while your at your place of employment. Yours is to keep that employer happy, hers is to provide childcare, however you both choose to define that.  I don't necessarily have an issue with her not cleaning the house during the day,  because he job is simply childcare. But when you get home,  the work left to be done should be split between you.  It's not fair for 1 spouse to work 24/7 and the other 10 hour days.", "NTA. She needs to get help.  Her meds adjusted, hormone testing, and a large dose of suck it up because yall are in the fast runnings to divorce. ALOT of parents have anxiety,  depression, ptsd, etc, but those kids didn't ask to be brought into this world, and it took two to make them. You're basically doing the single dad routine while she naps and your not getting any play? You're a better man than most.", "NTA\n\nBut you've been enabling your wife's laziness for a long time. When one's ill, they go to the doctor. But she sees nothing wrong in sleeping all day and doing nothing.", "NTA, you're being taken for a ride, she needs a wake up call, give her an ultimatum, seek help or you're done!!! \nIt may sound callous, but sometimes tough love wakes a person up, when they realise things as they know it, are at stake of being lost, you can't do much more by the sounds OP, so you now need to start looking after your well being for your kids sake, if it means separation then so be it. I wish you all best fella, and hopefully your wife gets the help she needs .", "NAH\n\nYou should be more concerned that your wife needs 14 hours of sleep a day? That's indicative of a medical issue and doesn't make her an asshole.", "Nta- your poor wife needs some help, she seems to be struggling. I\u2019m very sad for her mental state. I hope she makes it.", "why are you living with a deadbeat?", "ESH but only for one reason and that\u2019s for expecting your wife\u2019s personality to change once she gave birth \n\nGiving birth doesn\u2019t alter a person\u2019s personality.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that you would expect her behavior to change and when it didn\u2019t, you had another kid?\n\nSetting boundaries is important but setting a boundary that is clearly going to fail?  \n\nYou are drowning with no life preserver is coming.

Certainly to work with a therapist ASAP, and look into postpartum depression (especially since she had signs of depression and anxiety before). Also, and I'm not a doctor, but personally I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression years ago only to find out within the past couple years it's actually mild ADHD- ADHD/ADD in women presents completely differently than in men (from the studies I've read, primarily due to societal conditioning from an early age but there are other factors too). This field of research really has only started to be studied in the past decade or so, so most folks don't even know about it. I have half a dozen girlfriends (all in our late 20's-late 30's) with stories similar to mine. \n\nOn the topic of the house being a mess- I don't know your financial situation, but if there's room in the budget (even if it means cutting back on some non-necessities for a few months) I would look into a cleaning service coming through, at least once. While it's not cheap, it's  easy to schedule and I think would do wonders for both of y'all's mental health.", "Antidepressants can have a sedative effect which can cause you to sleep more.

He said that a lot of his patients and colleagues patients have noticed that the name brand works better for SOME people. Others have no problem with generic. I guess it depends on the person using it. No study done or anything. Just what he and his colleagues have dealt with over the years. I also have a friend who has to have name brand for her depression or it doesn\u2019t work. Generic worked great for her anxiety though. I just hoped the info would be helpful to OP. \ud83d\ude42"]}
