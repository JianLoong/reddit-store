{"id": 27271, "submission_id": "16nqrjm", "title": "AITA for refusing to take part in sibling moments during my dad's wedding?", "selftext": "Title sounds weird? I'll explain. So my dad is engaged to a woman, Ruth. Ruth has an almost 5 year old daughter Laci. Their wedding is planned for January and ever since Ruth and Laci moved in with us (dad and me) and Laci and I have been forced to share a room because it's a two bedroom house, Laci has become obsessed with me. She thinks I'm the coolest person and she always wants to be around me. So Ruth came up with this idea of having sibling moments during the wedding where we embrace each other as true sisters for the first time. She mentioned it to Laci before either her or my dad mentioned it to me. So Laci was really excited and happy.\n\nBut I'm not comfortable with the idea. I don't want to hold her during a family unity ceremony is performed, I don't want to do a special sister dance where the spotlight is on us, and I don't want to make promises that I'm not sure I would keep. The promises were already printed out by Ruth and she showed me what I would need to say. It's basically I will always answer her calls, always call her my sister from that day forward, that I will be there for her and chase away the bullies and show her how to do things. It's not that I'm opposed to us being closer at all. But I won't be going out of my way to come home from college just to be there more with Laci. I might not even stay at my dad's when I do because I don't want to share with Laci. I already hate doing it now.\n\nI expressed that I didn't want to do those things during the wedding and Ruth was furious. My dad was like it would be so sweet and would be super cute to look back on when watching the wedding videos. Ruth was saying how excited Laci now is and how I would crush her heart and soul and stomp on them if I refuse to do it. She even claimed Laci was saying how excited she was to have me as a sister forever and that she wants me to be her protector. Not sure I buy a 4 year old saying all that.\n\nEver since I said I didn't want to do those things I have been under a lot of pressure to give in and Ruth has been accusing me of rejecting Laci and refusing to have anything to do with her. That's not what this is but I don't love Laci right now and I don't know that I will be playing the big sister role. It might be more like cousins because honestly I will be moving out as soon as I'm 18 to get a little more space.

Laci should not have been told about this unless OP had previously agreed to it.\n2. Forcing a relationship is a bad idea.\n3. Making a public spectacle of a forced relationship is an even worse idea.\n4. Ruth needs to stop weaponizing Laci to try to convince OP to go along.\n\nRuth needs to back off and let any relationship develop naturally.  Laci is acting age appropriately in being a nuisance to OP.  Hopefully, she will outgrow that.  But OP should not be forced to undertake these wedding activities.\n\nIt is not OP's wedding so this arrangement wasn't OP's choice and Ruth (and dad) should stop acting as if this is a major union by OP and Laci.  It's not.  It's Ruth and dad's union.  Laci & OP are just affected by it but don't have a say in it.\n\nETA:  I'm guessing Ruth wants the vows she wrote for OP said at the wedding cuz it will likely be videotaped and then she can throw it in OP's face when Ruth thinks that OP isn't \"honoring her vows to Laci.\"  Yuck!", "NTA\n\nRuth is a massive AH, and honestly, it's heartbreaking because her disingenuous nonsense and the imaginary idealised but entirely false picture she's created in her head and tried to force on you and Laci is not only weird and more about herself than about either of the kids actually involved in the \"sibling\" relationship at hand . . . it's also ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY.\n\nThis might be a different situation if you were reluctant to have any relationship with Laci and she was trying to encourage one. But that's not what's happening here. \n\nInstead, she has lucked into an older teenaged stepdaughter who actually embraces being a big sister to a preschool-aged new little stepsister, which is a real rarity! You've indicated that you're happy to created a genuine relationship of some sort with Laci, to spend some time with her and get to know her, and even be something of a big sister to her, which is really lovely. And of course you don't have to spend ALL your time with her or be \"her protector\", LOL. My oldest nieces absolutely adore their little siblings to bits, but they have lives of their own, which is not only appropriate but healthy with an age difference that large, and they certainly don't see themselves as \"protectors\" - that's a parent's job, not a sibling's. \n\nThose weird vows that Ruth wrote don't reflect any kind of real, meaningful, naturally-developing relationship. They're some sort of imaginary fairytale ideal, and they aren't healthy. And while some commenters are arguing that they're meant to be figurative, that's not really the point. The point is that she's made you uncomfortable and actually created a wedge in the REAL, THOUGHTFUL, HEARTFELT relationship that you have been creating with her child . . . all in favour of some made-up nonsense in her head. \n\nNot to mention that she started this whole thing by breaking the cardinal rule of parenting: you don't get a small child's hopes up or tell them things well in advance of when they might happen or have been agreed to. It only leads to heartbreak and disaster.\n\nRuth is the only AH here. She seems deeply manipulative, self-centred, and like she doesn't actually have Laci's OR your best interests at heart, just her own selfish view of things. I'm sad both for Laci (having a mother who plays with her emotions and sets her up for disappointment) and for you, having to deal with someone who seems so manipulative. You are NTA. Be honest. Tell them that you care about Laci, but you will build a relationship with her in your own time, and through GENUINE connection, not based on Ruth's words and performative nonsense.", "*Hey, why don't you lie to a child and make promises you won't keep, just for the sake of us having a cute moment at our wedding day ? You can't say no, we already told your sister you would do it and we don't want to have to do some parenting !*\n\nNTA, obviously. You shouldn't be force to do something you don't feel comfortable doing.", "NTA.  Your future stepmother is pushing way too hard.  Tell her \"I won't be bullied into your idea of a sibling relationship\" and repeat that phrase every time.  Go grey rock on her and hopefully she'll get the message.", "\u201cDad, understand right now that if I am made to do this I will be 100% silent. Laci may only be 5 yo, and I get that her mom is excited for this wedding, but I am not responsible for either issue. Not only do I have zero privacy in what used to be my room, now you\u2019re asking me to promise to always answer her calls etc. Seriously? No.\u201d\n\nNTA. \n\nDo you have grandparents or an aunt or uncle you can tell, get their help?", "NTA. I think it was rude of them to not ask you first if this was something you'd be comfortable doing.  I would talk to your dad and let him know that you didn't appreciate how this was all planned out without asking if you were comfortable with it which was hurtful. Tell him that maybe if he and Ruth had *included* you in the planning of it, you could have come up with something that you would be willing to do.", "NTA. People never seem to understand that you can't force someone to love a child, whether it is a sister, a cousin or a step. Forcing always makes it worse. You have the right to have your distance and space.", "NTA\n\nThey are trying to force a bonding relationship that you're not comfortable with. You are allowed to your feelings", "NTA. You aren't rejecting Laci. You are rejecting the contrived performance piece that *Ruth is scripting*. What Ruth is doing isn't cute; it's bizarre and creepy. If you aren't comfortable, then stand your ground on this. No means No; the anger, weaponizing of Laci's feelings and bully tactics are just wrong, and I would call your them both out for this toxic drama.", "NTA, and that fact that Ruth told her daughter 1st, was deliberate.  \n\"You can't say no now, you'll break her heart\" <insert triumphant evil smile>  \nYou are putting up a very real boundary, Ruth will obviously trample all over that.  \nHave a one on one with your dad, if he refuses to support your boundary, well then unfortunately, he won't likely support any boundary moving forward.", "NTA. That's an absurd and uncomfortable thing. Cringy AF, even if both of you are willing, beyond awkward to be forced into it. Just stand your ground. Your feelings here matter", "Nta talk to your bio mother about this", "NTA. A 5 year old attaching to someone is not unheard of. To make you make those promises to a small child, is wrong. I don't even answer my little bio brother's phone calls every time he calls (and we have a good relationship, sometimes I am busy/in meetings/etc). \n\nYou need to talk to your dad to shut this down. It will set Laci up for heartbreak. Just because you don't want to do these things does not mean you don't care for Laci.", "They should have asked you first, and gained your consent to participate in this smarmy show. Ruth and your dad are getting married, not \"you and your dad and Laci and Ruth.\". It affects you because he's your dad and you'll interact with Laci as a matter of course. Outside of that, any relationship between you and Laci will develop or it won't. But it can't be forced, and the whole sibling moment sounds like them trying to contract your services as a big sister.\n\nAdd in the fact that you're moving out soon so there's not likely to be much of a relationship between you and Laci anyway.\n\nNTA", "Her list of rules is bat shit crazy and your dad is failing you. I wish you could show him this because he needs a reality check.", "NTA! Ruth and your dad should have okayed this with you before it was ever mentioned to Laci! So the one responsible for crushing poor little Laci is her own mom! Ruth is trying to manipulate into doing something that you don't want to do for your own very good reasons.\n\nIs there a way you could talk with your dad alone about how this is impacting you?", "NTA. Several ways of handling this. 1 - during the wedding ceremony when they ask if anyone objects stand up and say you do as you do not want someone who is manipulating as a step mother.  2 - when it gets to the sister vows thing just go off script and state that you are being forced to say this against your wishes by your new step mother.", "NTA- next time Ruth brings it up, tell your father that you will no longer be attending the wedding {and possibly going no contact depend on there response} because BOTH he and Ruth are assholes who refuse to listen to you.", "NTA . You don\u2019t have to be in a forced relationship. And to address the \u201cfamily union\u201d \u2026 if you decided that you did not consent to this marriage, would it not happen? Of course it would happen. You are not a wedding prop and a 17 year old should not be sharing a room with an unrelated 4 year old. This whole thing is odd and very toxic", "NTA. Get out as soon as you can and limit your visits back.", "NTA, Ruth needs to get back in her box", "NTA. What the hell is wrong with adults forcing kids into doing this stupid shit.", "NTA Tell your dad to stop this crap now and get his future wife under control since she is not going to force you to lie in front of people so she can throw it in your face later saying she has it on video.

Tell him that it is wonderful that he has found someone that makes him happy and that he is going to vow to love her forever (how'd that work out with your mom?).  But, he needs to understand that it is his decision, you were not part of forming this new \"family\".  You didn't fall in love with Ruth and her pushiness and her jamming Laci down your throat is making you very uncomfortable.  **You did not choose Ruth, you did not choose Laci**.  To DEMAND that you make these vows to Laci (which were dreamed up by Ruth, you had no part in them) is ridiculous - ask Dad why no one has asked how you feel Laci?   You didn't fall in love with Ruth and Laci - just because Dad loves them, doesn't mean you automatically have the same feelings actually, their behavior is making you dislike them.  \n\nNo one is considering your feelings in this.  He is your Dad and he needs to start thinking about how all of this impacts you.  Ask him why he doesn't care about your feelings, how come Laci's supposed feelings (which are really Ruth's) are the ones that matter?

He should have moved to bigger home first... NTA ruth is typical step -monster", "NTA, and it's wrong that at 17, you have to share a room with a 5-year-old. Your dad's fiance and her daughter shouldn't have moved in until your dad had a house big enough that you don't need to share. Or the 5-year-old should be sharing a room with her mum and your dad.\n\nIt's almost like they are waiting for you to move out for college and have no place to return home during the holidays, etc.  Ask them about where you are supposed to stay during the holidays from college.

And your father needs to step up and put an end to this nonsense. Yes, it would be cute and all IF YOU ACTUALLY WERE WILLINGLY DOING IT AND ENJOYING IT. There's nothing cute in putting up an act in front of everyone just because someone wants to make a show out of both of you.", "NTA - If you make those promises you WILL be expected to hold them, and Ruth WILL use them against you.\n\nStay firm, she wants to make you a scapegoat and babysitter, don\u2019t let her.", "Nta. Honestly ew. That whole thing sounds so cringy and awkward. I would get it if you were both 5, that would be cute. Refuse to do it. It is important to have hard boundaries established or Ruth will walk all over you.", "NTA, Ruth is though! She has not right to demand you have a relationship with her five yr old kid!

If you don't feel comfortable doing it, don't do it, simple!", "You are quite right not to want to make promises you may not be able to keep. If you do make those promises then there is no doubt in my mind that you will be held to them even when you are both adults. There may, of course, be an element of you not being able to refuse to childmind your little \"sister\" if you do this as well because it was a \"promise\".\n\nI very strongly suggest that you make it clear that you will not be doing this far too cutesy \"siblings moments\" when you are not, actually, siblings. Laci willl be disappointed because her mother has made such a thing of it without consulting you but she will have to get used to disappointments, they happen often. This sibling moment thing will do nothing to promote a bond but will possibly end up with you having guilt feelings if you don't keep to it.\n\nYou should only do what you are comfortable with. Suddenly having a big sister role thrust on you is difficult. Sisters don't always get along; they can have big disagreements as you probably know from your friends. It's not exactly an idyllic relationshhip (no relationships are by the way). Obviously NTA.\n\nAnd remember: NO is a complete sentence.", "NTA.

Ruth did an end-run around both you and your dad, who is currently more anxious to please his bride-to-be than he is about the comfort of his almost-adult daughter. This problem with Laci is of Ruth's making and therefore it is her problem to solve.\n\nHopefully you have some other family that actually care enough about you to back you on this.", "NTA\n\nI would play nice and play along and then move out and go lower contact as i get older.", "NTA, but maybe you can find a compromise by writing your own \u201cvows,\u201d so to speak.

She handed them to me and asked if I was going to be her big sister because she always wanted one. I ended up being an only child who is also the oldest of more than 10. We technically share no blood relationship, at all, and I can honestly say I'm just as close to her as I am to all the others. You are making a big decision when you agree.

So Ruth and your dad have already put their desires above your needs and that\u2019s a bad sign for the future.\n\n\u201cLaci was saying how excited she was to have me as a sister forever and that she wants me to be her protector. Not sure I buy a 4 year old saying all that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t buy it either, it sounds like Ruth has been asking Laci a lot of leading questions and while her four-year-old might have said yes, it got reported back to you a little bit differently.\n\nIf Ruth wanted you to do some unusual things at her wedding, she should have asked you first, not used a four-year-old to emotionally blackmail you into it. u/Music_withRocks_In is right, you need to talk to your dad privately and let him know this is counter-productive. It\u2019s his job as your dad to put a stop to this. I also agree with the multiple people who think Ruth\u2019s manipulation won\u2019t stop here. Any day now she\u2019s going to promise Laci you\u2019re going to have a special girls holiday while she goes away on a honeymoon trip with your dad\u2026\n\nTell your dad it\u2019s a no and any further manipulation will result in a no as well. He ought to back you, but even if he doesn\u2019t, nobody can force you to do this stuff. If there is a compromise you could live with then it might be smart to offer it, e.g. \u201cI\u2019ll dance with Laci but only if lots of other people are on the dancefloor too. We can tell her that\u2019s her sister dance. What I\u2019m not going to do is say vows or dance while everyone watches, and if Ruth tries to manipulate me into it on the day, I WILL refuse.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m pissed for you that they made you share a room with a small kid which means you are ultimately a full time babysitter when you are around. \n\nThe wedding thing is laughable. Sit with your dad without Ruth and talk to him. Shut down the idea and say this marriage is a union with him and this Ruth, not you and your step sister. Remind him, none of this is your choice. All that nonsense load of promises she wrote down, is to make you feel bad and guilt you into taking care of laci even when you don\u2019t want to. Hell no. If she was stupid enough to promise this to laci without asking you first, it only means she\u2019s trampling on your opinions and did it so you would be trapped into agreeing.\n\nRemind him again and again you are his child. If he isn\u2019t going to put his foot down and let you do what you are comfortable with, you will only start disliking laci and Ruth. Is that what he wants? When the dislike grows bigger, you will go LC or NC with them. Is that his goal?", "I swear I've read this post before", "Honestly, that sounds weird. If I was at a wedding and that happened I would probably tell people stories about the super bizzaro wedding I went to.", "NTA. Ruth\u2019s plans for the wedding ceremony make me cringe for you. Just make sure you have or are working on your college finances, scholarships, grants, etc.", "Ewww I\u2019ve got the ick. This is making my skin crawl. \nNTA", "NTA. This is weird. It\u2019s their wedding; it shouldn\u2019t be focused on their kids. And who asks a little kid about something like that before checking with the other person?! Maybe Ruth should take this time to focus on her own vows & wedding. Good luck!", "Yes! Good grief", "YES", "Yeah I\u2019d say \u201cit\u2019s not so much that I don\u2019t wanna do this particular thing - although I super do not want to. It\u2019s more that this sets Ruth up to think she can manipulate me by promising things to laci I never agreed to. That\u2019s not good for laci or for me.\u201d", "Yeah I\u2019m with you. I have 5 siblings and 3 kids of my own. It is totally worth trying play the hero with the younger siblings. Pour into them when they young and they will remember it for the rest of their life. Forget about MIL and just focus on saying something from the heart that will build the new step sister up, she will remember it forever.", "How?", "Why? Because she isn\u2019t lying and public declarations of fake love??  People should be honest. Have some self respect.", "A small thing? Promising to be a devoted sister to a random kid is not a small thing. And if it is a small thing, why is op being bullied into doing it?", "Yep. Lie and not mean it. That\u2019s the adult way. Lol", ">YTA\n\nGiven your comment why is OP the AH?", "OP is not \u201cbad\u201d even if she decides she doesn\u2019t want a sister. Adults make things happen to kids. Kids do not get to choose their lives. Obviously we don\u2019t know the whole story here but it is obvious the parents are pushing an image that does not exist. Sounds like recipe for success\u2026 let\u2019s force everyone in to acting like we are the most loving and perfect new blended family. It\u2019s bullshit. Not that the girls won\u2019t ever be friends but they are not sisters. Just two girls forced together because their parents made decisions ( good or bad).", "The situations men find themselves in when they are only interested in a warm hole. Too bad they can\u2019t be focused on their child who is uncomfortable with this situation. Too bad OP has to be more of an adult than her dad.", "Old enough to know she doesn't want an instant little sister glued to her side and in her room just because dad decided to remarry.", "Other than your integrity. Sure, lie and go against your morals to make your step mom happy. The same step mom who doesn\u2019t care or ask you about what you want, only what he daughter wants.", "Have you had to babysit?", "You are an adult. You don\u2019t even have to attend this wedding - no one can force you. Tell Ruth she has two choices - you attend or not attend, but you aren\u2019t going to put on a show for her.", "I feel for you, you\u2019re a young girl and this is a lot of pressure. I suggest you really tell your dad that you\u2019re not comfortable with it, tell him you\u2019re okay with being like a \u201cbig sister\u201d to laci but you\u2019re not comfortable with the spotlight on you or the wedding event stuff. Hopefully he can explain that to Ruth", "> Why is \u201cLaci will be hurt\u201d\n\nNeed to respond to that with, \"I'm already hurt!\"", "He's marrying a cook/housekeeper and his future caretaker. He'll never say a word. Happens all the time.", "I disagree. This is Ruth\u2019s responsibility to fix with those words, not OP\u2019s. It\u2019s sad that Laci is the pawn, but it is not on OP to fix Ruth\u2019s cruel manipulation. NTA", "Exactly! Junior is happy so daughter will just have to sacrifice her future to keep Junior happy.", "I meant NTA. Typo \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Exactly! What makes one daughter\u2019s feelings more important than the others", "yes this horrified me, unless you're in a poorer country where multiple siblings, cousins even grandparents share a room it is outrageous to force a 17 year old to share with a random 4 year old they just met. Wow.", "I wondered that too. Is Ruth trying to jam this down OP\u2019s throat to get dad to adopt her daughter? Is she promising -in any real and legally binding way - to support OP as a parent (college tuition coming up!)", "Not that I am aware of. But I think there are some challenges that would prevent that. He might in the future.", "Almost a few times but I already had stuff on so I just went and did it and left Ruth and my dad to figure it out.", "I like \u201cproviding wisdom\u201d.   Ruth can interpret that in any way she likes.", "Ruth can make her wedding a big deal. What she can\u2019t do is force a sisterly relationship between OP and he daughter. I understand that it will make her look good in front of all their friends at the wedding but OP has stated she is not comfortable with that type of declaration about their relationship. Maybe Ruth should focus on her wedding and not focus on forcing a relationship with her daughter.", "Oh but the parents are definitely going to remember it when they want someone to babysit.", "Or, a relationship will not grow at all. This seems like some adults trying to force a \u201cperfect blended family \u201c picture for their wedding. Maybe they will have a good sister relationship and maybe they won\u2019t. It\u2019s not fair for a \u201cnew\u201d mom/wife to force this on OP.", "Or, she can keep her integrity, and not lie. She doesn\u2019t have any of these relationships with the child and probably won\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand why she would need to pretend that she did. Obviously there is an extreme age difference and they are not required to be family just because the parents got married. Maybe they will be friends later and maybe they won\u2019t. Maybe the marriage will last long enough for that and maybe it won\u2019t. Parents shouldn\u2019t push their kids into lying so that they can look good. What are you teaching the kids if you are asking them to lie, publicly, possibly in front of a lot of people and more than likely recorded for future viewing.", "I would add to check the definition of 'puppet' in the dictionary and that you aren't one - hence the autonomy of decisions and surprise! Your own feelings that aren't their freaking fantasy. NTA", "It might make a dent with Dad about how awful this whole thing is if OP prints this out and hands it to him with a \"the interwebs think Ruth is a nasty piece of work just like I do Dad. Make her back off because she is manipulating both of us and I'm sick of it.\"", "Actually the nuclear option would be to stand up and say \u201cI came here and Ruth has demanded that I say vows she wrote for me to say to her daughter. Instead I came to say if Dad continues with this relationship I will be going no contact with him as I see Ruth as an abuser and him as an enabler. Screw you demanding that I act like a trained monkey at your wedding, I already told you no I wasn\u2019t doing this.\u201d", "You are certainly old enough to talk like an adult to your dad and step mother. You\u2019re a year away from college. You aren\u2019t a child. It\u2019s ridiculous to promise things to anyone you have no intention or ability to follow through. You won\u2019t be around to show laci how to do things nor protect her from idiots. That\u2019s her parents\u2019 job. \n\nI would get some real promises about the shit that matters, happening. Things like where you\u2019re going to college and how that\u2019s gonna get paid for. Those promises are the ones that matter - coming from them, the responsible adults, to you, the kid. \n\nIf they are agreeing to do what parents are supposed to do, being at all helpful to you, you could compromise a wee bit and maybe say something nice to welcome Ruth and laci into your family at the wedding, it\u2019s no skin off your nose. If they\u2019re assholes who have no intention of promising YOU anything REAL, then that is something I\u2019d rather you found out sooner rather than later.  Is this family thing a one way street? \n\nStart looking at scholarships, grants and small private colleges that offer full ride first year so you can get into a good school, with work/study program, and ignore the wedding drama as much as possible. It\u2019s small stuff in the grand scheme of things. I would do that anyway - it can\u2019t hurt. \n\nYour final year of HS is what is important, your SAT scores, your essay if you have to write one, your extra curriculars.   following your little sister around the preschool as her bodyguard won\u2019t cut it. Go read to kids in the hospital or whatever floats your boat. I\u2019d get a part time job too in case Flakey McStepmom didn\u2019t have \u201csend stepdaughter to college, because faaaamily doesn\u2019t work if we\u2019re not all in it\u201d on her bingo card. \n\nFind out how much of this is real and how much is editorial because to put it bluntly, money talks and bullshit walks.

Have you graduated- will you be able to get to school easily from your new place?   Will you still be able to balance studying and working?\n\nIt sounds like your in the US - what about health insurance if your dad kicks you off?", "This is hilarious because I also just accepted Sergeant Mom as a real thing and never questioned it. Like yeah, chain of command!", "I'd be tempted to actually do that. Call her into the room. \"Hey, Laci! Come here, your mom just promised me she'd get you a three whole puppies and let you buy all the toys and candy you want when you go to the store to get the puppies. Ooh, also she wants you to pick out the colors for your new room because she says we're moving into a mansion because we both deserve our own space.\"\n\n  \nIt'd be incredibly cruel, so I'd never do it, but it'd get the point across.", "I mean, you shouldn't cohabitate when you have more kids than rooms. OP doesn't say how old they are but from how verbose they are I'm guessing at least three time's laci's age- so at least fifteen.\n\nHaving her share a room with a five year old is cruel to both of them.", "Not much of a gap actually. I think it's less than five years.", "I know where I will stay and I have already talked about this with the person I would be living with.
