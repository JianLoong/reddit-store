{"id": 27271, "submission_id": "16nqrjm", "title": "AITA for refusing to take part in sibling moments during my dad's wedding?", "selftext": "Title sounds weird? I'll explain. So my dad is engaged to a woman, Ruth. Ruth has an almost 5 year old daughter Laci. Their wedding is planned for January and ever since Ruth and Laci moved in with us (dad and me) and Laci and I have been forced to share a room because it's a two bedroom house, Laci has become obsessed with me. She thinks I'm the coolest person and she always wants to be around me. So Ruth came up with this idea of having sibling moments during the wedding where we embrace each other as true sisters for the first time. She mentioned it to Laci before either her or my dad mentioned it to me. So Laci was really excited and happy.\n\nBut I'm not comfortable with the idea. I don't want to hold her during a family unity ceremony is performed, I don't want to do a special sister dance where the spotlight is on us, and I don't want to make promises that I'm not sure I would keep. The promises were already printed out by Ruth and she showed me what I would need to say. It's basically I will always answer her calls, always call her my sister from that day forward, that I will be there for her and chase away the bullies and show her how to do things. It's not that I'm opposed to us being closer at all. But I won't be going out of my way to come home from college just to be there more with Laci. I might not even stay at my dad's when I do because I don't want to share with Laci. I already hate doing it now.\n\nI expressed that I didn't want to do those things during the wedding and Ruth was furious. My dad was like it would be so sweet and would be super cute to look back on when watching the wedding videos. Ruth was saying how excited Laci now is and how I would crush her heart and soul and stomp on them if I refuse to do it. She even claimed Laci was saying how excited she was to have me as a sister forever and that she wants me to be her protector. Not sure I buy a 4 year old saying all that.\n\nEver since I said I didn't want to do those things I have been under a lot of pressure to give in and Ruth has been accusing me of rejecting Laci and refusing to have anything to do with her. That's not what this is but I don't love Laci right now and I don't know that I will be playing the big sister role. It might be more like cousins because honestly I will be moving out as soon as I'm 18 to get a little more space.

It's not.  It's Ruth and dad's union.  Laci & OP are just affected by it but don't have a say in it.", "NTA\n\nRuth is a massive AH, and honestly, it's heartbreaking because her disingenuous nonsense and the imaginary idealised but entirely false picture she's created in her head and tried to force on you and Laci is not only weird and more about herself than about either of the kids actually involved in the \"sibling\" relationship at hand . . . it's also ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY.\n\nThis might be a different situation if you were reluctant to have any relationship with Laci and she was trying to encourage one. But that's not what's happening here. \n\nInstead, she has lucked into an older teenaged stepdaughter who actually embraces being a big sister to a preschool-aged new little stepsister, which is a real rarity! You've indicated that you're happy to created a genuine relationship of some sort with Laci, to spend some time with her and get to know her, and even be something of a big sister to her, which is really lovely. And of course you don't have to spend ALL your time with her or be \"her protector\", LOL. My oldest nieces absolutely adore their little siblings to bits, but they have lives of their own, which is not only appropriate but healthy with an age difference that large, and they certainly don't see themselves as \"protectors\" - that's a parent's job, not a sibling's. \n\nThose weird vows that Ruth wrote don't reflect any kind of real, meaningful, naturally-developing relationship. They're some sort of imaginary fairytale ideal, and they aren't healthy. And while some commenters are arguing that they're meant to be figurative, that's not really the point. The point is that she's made you uncomfortable and actually created a wedge in the REAL, THOUGHTFUL, HEARTFELT relationship that you have been creating with her child . . . all in favour of some made-up nonsense in her head. \n\nNot to mention that she started this whole thing by breaking the cardinal rule of parenting: you don't get a small child's hopes up or tell them things well in advance of when they might happen or have been agreed to. It only leads to heartbreak and disaster.\n\nRuth is the only AH here. She seems deeply manipulative, self-centred, and like she doesn't actually have Laci's OR your best interests at heart, just her own selfish view of things. I'm sad both for Laci (having a mother who plays with her emotions and sets her up for disappointment) and for you, having to deal with someone who seems so manipulative. You are NTA. Be honest. Tell them that you care about Laci, but you will build a relationship with her in your own time, and through GENUINE connection, not based on Ruth's words and performative nonsense.", "*Hey, why don't you lie to a child and make promises you won't keep, just for the sake of us having a cute moment at our wedding day ? You can't say no, we already told your sister you would do it and we don't want to have to do some parenting !*\n\nNTA, obviously. You shouldn't be force to do something you don't feel comfortable doing.", "NTA.  Your future stepmother is pushing way too hard.

Go grey rock on her and hopefully she'll get the message.", "\u201cDad, understand right now that if I am made to do this I will be 100% silent. Laci may only be 5 yo, and I get that her mom is excited for this wedding, but I am not responsible for either issue.

No.\u201d\n\nNTA. \n\nDo you have grandparents or an aunt or uncle you can tell, get their help?", "NTA. I think it was rude of them to not ask you first if this was something you'd be comfortable doing.  I would talk to your dad and let him know that you didn't appreciate how this was all planned out without asking if you were comfortable with it which was hurtful. Tell him that maybe if he and Ruth had *included* you in the planning of it, you could have come up with something that you would be willing to do.", "NTA. People never seem to understand that you can't force someone to love a child, whether it is a sister, a cousin or a step. Forcing always makes it worse. You have the right to have your distance and space.", "NTA\n\nThey are trying to force a bonding relationship that you're not comfortable with. You are allowed to your feelings", "NTA. You aren't rejecting Laci. You are rejecting the contrived performance piece that *Ruth is scripting*. What Ruth is doing isn't cute; it's bizarre and creepy. If you aren't comfortable, then stand your ground on this.

That's an absurd and uncomfortable thing. Cringy AF, even if both of you are willing, beyond awkward to be forced into it. Just stand your ground. Your feelings here matter", "Nta talk to your bio mother about this", "NTA. A 5 year old attaching to someone is not unheard of. To make you make those promises to a small child, is wrong. I don't even answer my little bio brother's phone calls every time he calls (and we have a good relationship, sometimes I am busy/in meetings/etc). \n\nYou need to talk to your dad to shut this down. It will set Laci up for heartbreak. Just because you don't want to do these things does not mean you don't care for Laci.", "They should have asked you first, and gained your consent to participate in this smarmy show. Ruth and your dad are getting married, not \"you and your dad and Laci and Ruth.\". It affects you because he's your dad and you'll interact with Laci as a matter of course. Outside of that, any relationship between you and Laci will develop or it won't. But it can't be forced, and the whole sibling moment sounds like them trying to contract your services as a big sister.\n\nAdd in the fact that you're moving out soon so there's not likely to be much of a relationship between you and Laci anyway.\n\nNTA", "Her list of rules is bat shit crazy and your dad is failing you. I wish you could show him this because he needs a reality check.", "NTA! Ruth and your dad should have okayed this with you before it was ever mentioned to Laci! So the one responsible for crushing poor little Laci is her own mom! Ruth is trying to manipulate into doing something that you don't want to do for your own very good reasons.\n\nIs there a way you could talk with your dad alone about how this is impacting you?", "NTA. Several ways of handling this. 1 - during the wedding ceremony when they ask if anyone objects stand up and say you do as you do not want someone who is manipulating as a step mother.  2 - when it gets to the sister vows thing just go off script and state that you are being forced to say this against your wishes by your new step mother.", "NTA- next time Ruth brings it up, tell your father that you will no longer be attending the wedding {and possibly going no contact depend on there response} because BOTH he and Ruth are assholes who refuse to listen to you.", "NTA . You don\u2019t have to be in a forced relationship. And to address the \u201cfamily union\u201d \u2026 if you decided that you did not consent to this marriage, would it not happen? Of course it would happen. You are not a wedding prop and a 17 year old should not be sharing a room with an unrelated 4 year old. This whole thing is odd and very toxic", "NTA.

Tell him that it is wonderful that he has found someone that makes him happy and that he is going to vow to love her forever (how'd that work out with your mom?).  But, he needs to understand that it is his decision, you were not part of forming this new \"family\".  You didn't fall in love with Ruth and her pushiness and her jamming Laci down your throat is making you very uncomfortable.  **You did not choose Ruth, you did not choose Laci**.  To DEMAND that you make these vows to Laci (which were dreamed up by Ruth, you had no part in them) is ridiculous - ask Dad why no one has asked how you feel Laci?   You didn't fall in love with Ruth and Laci - just because Dad loves them, doesn't mean you automatically have the same feelings actually, their behavior is making you dislike them.  \n\nNo one is considering your feelings in this.  He is your Dad and he needs to start thinking about how all of this impacts you.  Ask him why he doesn't care about your feelings, how come Laci's supposed feelings (which are really Ruth's) are the ones that matter?

Your dad's fiance and her daughter shouldn't have moved in until your dad had a house big enough that you don't need to share.

There may, of course, be an element of you not being able to refuse to childmind your little \"sister\" if you do this as well because it was a \"promise\".\n\nI very strongly suggest that you make it clear that you will not be doing this far too cutesy \"siblings moments\" when you are not, actually, siblings. Laci willl be disappointed because her mother has made such a thing of it without consulting you but she will have to get used to disappointments, they happen often. This sibling moment thing will do nothing to promote a bond but will possibly end up with you having guilt feelings if you don't keep to it.\n\nYou should only do what you are comfortable with.

This problem with Laci is of Ruth's making and therefore it is her problem to solve.\n\nHopefully you have some other family that actually care enough about you to back you on this.", "NTA\n\nI would play nice and play along and then move out and go lower contact as i get older.", "NTA, but maybe you can find a compromise by writing your own \u201cvows,\u201d so to speak.

Once you're out of the house, they want you to promise to take time away from your college and preparing for your adult life to deal with a 5 year-old. \n\nTry this, \"Dad, I'm happy for you, and I do want to have a positive relationship with Ruth and Laci, but right now, everything that's happening is prioritizing Laci at my expense. I know that I'm older, but that doesn't mean that I don't also need support and understanding.\" Then list specific ways that what they're doing and the things they're asking are negatively impacting you. Leave off the ways it's impacting your wants (fun, extra stuff, etc) because they'll use them as excuses to call you selfish and immature. Instead, focus on how this has negatively impacted your concrete needs (sleep, time/space to study, school work, privacy to do normal 17 year-old things, ability to fully be present in college in order to perform your best, etc.)\n\nBring it back to Laci with \"I'm happy to [things you are willing to do with/for Laci], but I don't have the capacity to both do what I need build a life for myself as an adult and do everything you're imagining I might for Laci. When you layout an unrealistic vision for a relationship without considering what's healthy for *both of us*, you're setting Laci and I up to fail at having a positive relationship at all. That's not fair to either of us\"", "Double down on any prep you're doing in order to make yourself self-sufficient by the time you're 18. It sucks that your dad is putting you in the position where you're going to have to do so, but in the long run it will be better for your mental health to put as much distance between you and Ruth as possible.\n\nLacy is obviously just being a kid. Be civil but don't give of yourself any more than you're willing to do so.", "Can you tell your dad that Ruth needs to back off or you will not participate in wedding. Ruth can\u2019t force you into a ceremony you don\u2019t believe in and you aren\u2019t making promises ( wish are important to keep) just so there is HAPPY FAMILY moment at the wedding. Point out your presence is not required if Ruth keeps pushing you may not attend.  In Ruth head this is her precious baby and everyone should want to indulge this child. It also will makes it look like the family is so special no fighting in this blended family.  You are so close to being able to walk away but don\u2019t be forced to compromise your principles", "Are you going to college soon?", "I\u2019m so sorry. Your dad is really failing you here. He needs to be on your side, this is a really bad position for him to be forcing you into and will backfire. You can\u2019t build a relationship on someone else\u2019s terms. They are trying to force you into something which will just result in you not engaging with them. Do you have other support people? Grandparents, aunts, uncles, trusted adults?", "OP said they are 17 going on 18 and laci is 4 going on 5", "I'll be going next year but I can move out technically before the wedding since I'll be turning 18 not long before the wedding."]}
