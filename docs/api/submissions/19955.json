You warned them not to buy you anymore. You could have refused to accept anymore, but they probably would be equally disappointed if you rejected their gift.", "nta... it is what it is. Cant turn into a hoarder just to appease your friends. Just dont keep it a secret, the more vocal you are about selling them to create morw space, the less wierd and awkward itll feel for selling a gift.\n\nSend a text blast asking if your friends want to adopt some of them, if not youll sell them to find them a good home and so your remaining marshmellows or whatever have more elbow room.", "NTA. Squishmallows are fun, but when it turns into a squishpocalypse, no so much.", "I just don't know, and I'm in a similar situation to yours. I wanted *one* specific Britney Spears Funko Pop. As I type, I'm staring at *every* BS Funko to date, plus several other non-Britney Funkos.

You do not want these. Anyone that repeatedly breaks your boundary is not doing so to be nice, and I dare say, is not really a friend. \n\nThink of any other situation where you tell someone to \"stop doing this\", and they continue to do this, then get mad at *you* for not being happy about it.\n\nI think it's time to reevaluate that relationship and think about whether it actually serves you well.\n\nBtw: any actual gift is yours once it is received, and you are free to do what you want with your belongings, even sell them.", "NTA for several reasons. A. If you tell someone that you don\u2019t want something and they give it to you anyway, it makes sense that you\u2019d get rid of it. B. A gift is yours to do with as you choose.", "Info, can you just say no thank you when you are handed the gift?", "NTA. Tell the friend that got mad that you TOLD them you didn't have any more room for them and to stop buying them yet they continued. Tell this to any of the other friends that complain as well. Also, reiterate bluntly that YOU HAVE NO MORE ROOM. They need to STOP buying the squishmallows as you're now being forced to get rid of a lot of them since YOU HAVE NO ROOM. Also remind them that once gifted, it is yours to do with as you please. If you want to use them to make a bonfire for a homemade rain dance ritual, then that is your right. It sounds like you and your friends and bf are just at that age where true maturity hasn't set in, but you SHOULD be mature enough to understand the word stop and honor that word. Going forward, maybe don't use the word \"collecting\" around them. In fact it may behoove you to say something along the lines of \"I don't care for \\[fan product\\] as a whole, but this one is cute so I think I'll get it.\" Once you've reached the limit you can handle or all the ones you think are cute and want, then say \"got the ones I like! Don't want or need anymore!\". Side note: \"fan product\" means anything that would have a following like beanie babies, squish mallows, funko pop, etc.", "NTA when I was around 8? my mom told all our relatives and friends that I loooove cats so the only gifts I received for the next 10 years were cat figurines/cat stuffies all cats everywhere\u2026 I donated the whole collection the minute I moved out at 18 and never looked back\u2026 a gift is a gift & yours to do with what you want - my mom still says when you give a gift you give it to the recipient to do as they please with it\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou were upfront about not wanting them yet they ignored you. Her fault for wasting her money getting you several a week of something you told her not to give you.  Ideally you should have just stood up to them and not accepted them but now they are yours to do with as you want.", "NTA\n\nGivers do next to dictate what happens to the gifts they give to people.  You can do what you want with them.\n\nYou have told them to stop giving you them.  You have no where to store them.  Ask your friends to store them for you - or pay for storage.  If they say no, ask them what you are supposed to do with them.\n\nYou can always just give them away.  Maybe the children's ward at your local hospital.", "Give them away on your local Facebook, Pay it Forward page.", "ESH \n\nI would have asked the gifter if they would take custody of any new ones and keep them at their place, and insisted that I don't have room.", ">  every BS Funko to date\n\nHo.. how many *are* there?!?", "Now I want a squishmellow pit too. That sounds amazing...", "I made the mistake of telling people I liked owls. It seemed like that just became the default gift idea for me. It didn't matter what it was as long as it looked like an owl or had one on it. There was a LOT of ugly owl crap around that time period (70s), unfortunately.", "They already told them to not get them any more. Why does op have to cater to this \"friend\" that keeps doing something after they have been asked to stop?", "Eleven, to date."]}
