You could do that twice in one year without breaking the bank. I can't see either of your weddings over shadowing the other. Heck, I could imagine your family being overjoyed to go to two ceremonies.\n\nI think your sister made poor decisions and is watching you make calculated ones and is trying to figure out how to squeeze in some sparkle for herself on your dime. Lots of people have managed to figure out how to have a jazzed up wedding day on low income, I've seen it. There's lots of saving, waiting, renting, and thrifting involved, and maybe lowering some expectations a bit, but it's doable.\n\nYou don't have to share your moment with anyone except for your special person.

Do not give in. You have been saving up and planning this day for a while now and you and your fianc\u00e9 absolutely deserve to have it dedicated to yourselves. This is not a small thing like borrowing your necklace for a night out. She wants your wedding. The wedding you\u2019ve been planning and saving for. She wants to replace you and your fianc\u00e9 in your wedding. Seriously, what do you think will happen if she walks down the aisle in a bridal gown? For her and her husband to say \u201cwelp, that was nice\u201d and leave the room? Do not let her do this. Block her and her husband if you must, but hold your ground.

You should have a friend on standby to wrangle her into another non bridal dress afterwards so you don't even have to worry about it.\n\nAgain, this is not an endorsement of letting her do this.

If you learn to recognize why you are enabling your sister in life, you will ultimately be better placed to feel in control of your decisions and feelings about her requests, regardless of what you do about any of them.

I\u2019ve seen several beautiful events ruined by petty speeches, drunken fights, or individuals like your sis who decide they\u2019re going to commandeer the day. Don\u2019t get your years of planning and $19k go to waste. If she doesn\u2019t get over it then she was never a true sister to you to begin with.", "I\u2019m so sorry your father and grandmother aren\u2019t here to protect you.", "OP, the biggest problem with being a doormat to keep the peace is that everyone walks all over you. Your sister in particular got some shit on her shoes and is making a dash to clean them off on you, instead of any other options available, and you are trying to convince yourself that it\u2019s not a problem because if you complain at all, suddenly they\u2019re unhappy it\u2019s your fault.\n\nYou are all adults now. It might be different when you\u2019re still at your parents\u2019 mercy, but I assume that\u2019s not the case anymore. You are never going to be respected by your sister and parents, especially not when you let them do whatever they please and you\u2019re just not supposed to make a fuss about it. Their \u201ccare\u201d of you only extends to you giving up anything you care about to please them.\n\nWhere are your feelings, OP? Do you actually want to share, or are you only sharing so you can avoid being ramroded by the people who should be giving you love instead? They don\u2019t love you for being compliant - they love that they\u2019re getting what they want, regardless that it\u2019s at your expense. In this case, both figuratively and legally.", "That was not a joke", "Girl....girl!!!!! I'm reading your co.ments, and you're just doing and saying anything to accommodate your sister. What about you?? When's your turn to be accommodated?? STOP trying to find a way to include your sister. NOTHING, but what short of using your stuff to do vow renewal will make her happy. And the only way to keep that from happening is to Not Give In to her ridiculous demands. Because yes to this how long before she asks if she and her husband can both join you guys up there?? And what about your fiance?? This is his day too!! Please don't let your family make you feel bad for asking for the unreasonable.", "You really need some counseling before your family puts a wedge between you and your fianc\u00e9 - you have been so conditioned to bow down to the golden child that you don\u2019t see her manipulating you and taking over what is supposed to be a celebration of love between you and Fianc\u00e9.", "Stacy\u2019s husband needs to get blocked.", "Let her walk down the aisle but say that she cannot wear a white dress then wait like a good 15/20 minutes before you walk down the aisle.", "So\u2026\u2026she\u2019s allowed to do nothing for you and you\u2019re even considering doing her a favor?!? Please don\u2019t OP. She\u2019s a taker. Not a sharer.", "You\u2019re still her sister, too. She\u2019s asking for a huge gift while giving you nothing, and it\u2019s YOUR wedding. She\u2019s giving you an anti-gift by making a scene about your wedding. She sounds like she can\u2019t stand not being the centre of attention.", "My sister got admittedly more than me, but my grandma also gave me money every now and then to help when I wasn\u2019t able to afford books, lodging or food during college, so if I added those things up it would probably be around the same inheritance. My sister honestly never has given me anything, and even now she\u2019s saying she can\u2019t afford a gift and asking me to pay for her hotel.", "That\u2019s one reason i think Stacy got married so soon, was because our father died of cancer a few weeks after her wedding and was wheelchair bound during the ceremony. She may have just wanted him there which was why it was rushed, meanwhile he told me not to try and push things up because he knew it would be hard for me to cancel and move around plans. Admittedly it shatters my heart I won\u2019t be able to be walked down the aisle by him, but my fianc\u00e9\u2019s father will be, which is kind of him.", "I\u2019m admittedly in therapy for this exact reason, mostly because I was jealous a few years ago when she got college free and I had to work through my highschool and college years to squeeze by. I\u2019ve mostly gotten through things, but I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s still hard", "He was\u2026 he just made new accounts to message.", "So your sister has always had more just given to her without working for it, you had to work for everything you have, and now she\u2019s demanding what\u2019s yours too? \n\nNTA - if you said yes you\u2019d just be making her more entitled, and she sounds plenty entitled. I can\u2019t believe her mother wants you to share your wedding which you paid for, when your sister already got an education for free when you paid for yours. She\u2019s making it clear she values her more.", "So tell your parents to pay for her wedding too..", "OP, you have zero obligation to host a wedding for her in any scenario. You are so NTA here. I\u2019ve literally never heard, in my entire life, somebody ask for something like this and expect acquiescence. \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 were right to treat this like a joke, because it is. I won\u2019t take the approach if denigrating your family, but it is wrong for anybody to support this request and to shame you for not going along with it. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happening. Please stand your ground and set your boundaries\u2026.for yourself and your future husband. \n\nI would implore you to examine the guilt you are feeling because I think it\u2019s all external and that you have internalized it. It is more than okay to want to support your sister, but not at your own expense. This is YOU AND YOUR FIANC\u00c9\u2019S day, not hers\u2026and you will never be an AH for prioritizing yourselves in this. \n\nAlso, CONGRATULATIONS \ud83c\udf89 I am so happy for you two!!", "Tell her to save up for a few years and have a renewal of vows ceremony and reception, complete with wedding dress, for her 5th anniversary. And NTA for refusing to cede your wedding to her.", "She can wait and have a big event when she\u2019s also 29", "If Sis can afford a wedding dress, she can afford a photographer to have a \u201cwedding photo shoot\u201d some other time than **your wedding** and **your aisle!** I guarantee she\u2019ll be hounding your photographer for personal photos all day and night. \n\nDon\u2019t let your sister\u2019s poor life planning or your mom pressure you into giving up a chunk of you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding day!", "No, she doesn't need a party at all. The previous poster is saying let her and her husband into the venue when it's empty. She can walk down the aisle in her dress, someone can be there to take a photo, that's it. No other guests seeing this, just her and her husband and someone to make sure she doesn't do anything batshit.", "Even if you don't mind being lower profile, I think you should still build in some contingency plans with friends who are close to you but distant enough from your family to be cool playing \"bad guy\", just in case. She sounds like a boundary pusher and I am also the introverted big sister who was raised to think it was all normal and fine for there to be one standard for me and another set of expectations for my sister but it's not normal or fine. You deserve to be able to set boundaries and this is SO above and beyond. I just want you to really know that before you go into the conversation/planning. Rehearse ways to enforce your boundaries (ie \"it's not just *my* day to share. We talked about this, and x is what fiance and I are comfortable sharing with you. If that's not enough, you'll have to have your own party.\") I don't know her, maybe I'm wrong, but better overprepared and safe than sorry.", "NTAH But please quit thinking of ways for you to do their work for them; they are not stupid and incapable. You were psychologically programmed since birth to allow other family members to take from you. Your sister is gaslighting you, and will disrespect you on your day\u2026with your mother\u2019s help. \n\nYOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR GROOM INTO SHARING HIS WEDDING. This is not how you want to begin your vows. Your sister wants to play pretend with your 20 grand. Do not start your marriage off with a dysfunctional family circus. Is this your wedding day that you will take seriously, forsaking all others? \n\nI predict she will do everything to upstage you and make you regret helping her, then tell you how wrong you are for getting upset. \n\n \nPlease search golden child vs scapegoat, and gaslighting. If you can\u2019t have your wedding, you won\u2019t be able to have anything that\u2019s yours. Stop their madness, for your future husband\u2019s sake. This is not even close to normal. Please see this dysfunction for what it is. Stop giving them your blessings. Helping is one thing, but you cannot keep letting them manipulate you into giving them things for which they have not worked. \n\nJust something between you and me my @$$!", "If you do this, the reception will be all about her. She will need to invite her in laws and her friends. Are you willing to shell out thousands? \n\nIf she wants a do-over,  she can save up and renew her vows on her anniversary.  \n\nIf you allow any of this to go forth, it WILL NOT BE YOUR WEDDING!  She will take it over. The date is no longer your anniversary,  it's hers. \n\nDon't sell yourself and your fiance short and essentially finance her wedding. \n\nAnd before? Guess what? That's when people will be drinking and eating instead of getting ready. By the time your own reception rolls around, everyone will be tired from such a long day and bail on you.", "If you are even considering doing this, it should be before the REHEARSAL dinner and she needs to change after. Not on your wedding day. You need to spend your wedding day focusing on yourself and getting ready for your moment. I wouldn\u2019t do this though- it will giver her permission to take over every big event in your life. \n\nShe had her chance for her big moment at her wedding. SHE CHOSE to rush it. That was her choice and she either needs to live with the consequences or save to have her moment and maybe renew her vows on an anniversary.", "Wow she wants to steal your wedding AND make you pay for her hotel/redo honeymoon night? Come on OP", "You aren\u2019t in therapy because you were jealous - you are in therapy because you were psychologically harmed by an unfair situation.", "So they\u2019re harassing you and your future husband on the eve of your wedding. I\u2019m sorry to besiege you with comments but this just gets worse and worse. They are treating you and your partner so terribly: you two are a team, so you need to stand up for him and let him stand up for you.", "Guessing but I think she wants to be seen by the guests. That\u2019s the bride experience. If she just wanted to wear a dress and walk down an aisle with no guests- she could do that anytime. She wants the oooos and ahhhhs. Total hijack.", "My fianc\u00e9 has been beyond helpful, he\u2019s the reason I haven\u2019t just given in to be honest. He knows how much a wedding means to me.", "He sounds great, so protect him from a lifetime of harassment. If stalking him works this time, Stacy\u2019s husband will do it again.", "What do you think people are gonna think when she walks down the aisle in a wedding dress to her husband right before your wedding they will think the same exact thing that they are renewing the rules or that he did something horrible do you need to remind her of this possibility. It\u2019s the first thing I thought of when you said that her husband was communicating with your Beyonc\u00e9 trying to convince him to change his mind"]}
