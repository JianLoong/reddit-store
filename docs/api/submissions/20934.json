You could do that twice in one year without breaking the bank. I can't see either of your weddings over shadowing the other. Heck, I could imagine your family being overjoyed to go to two ceremonies.\n\nI think your sister made poor decisions and is watching you make calculated ones and is trying to figure out how to squeeze in some sparkle for herself on your dime. Lots of people have managed to figure out how to have a jazzed up wedding day on low income, I've seen it. There's lots of saving, waiting, renting, and thrifting involved, and maybe lowering some expectations a bit, but it's doable.\n\nYou don't have to share your moment with anyone except for your special person.

I personally wouldn't agree to this. \n\nYour wedding day is a very special day and the entire ceremony is a deeply personal experience which will be treasured by you and your spouse for decades down the lane.

That sounds like an entitled attention seeker who is used to getting her way. She should be directing the spotlight on YOU, not taking it away to focus on herself. You need to hold your ground. Do not give in. You have been saving up and planning this day for a while now and you and your fianc\u00e9 absolutely deserve to have it dedicated to yourselves. This is not a small thing like borrowing your necklace for a night out. She wants your wedding. The wedding you\u2019ve been planning and saving for. She wants to replace you and your fianc\u00e9 in your wedding. Seriously, what do you think will happen if she walks down the aisle in a bridal gown? For her and her husband to say \u201cwelp, that was nice\u201d and leave the room? Do not let her do this. Block her and her husband if you must, but hold your ground.

Never had to work, college paid for.", "Honestly I think she's full of nonsense, but you know your family better than we do and I know from mine that sometimes you have to pick your battles, so I will reluctantly throw out this idea: what about at the rehearsal or even day of (before ANYONE arrives but when everything's decorated?) You should have a friend on standby to wrangle her into another non bridal dress afterwards so you don't even have to worry about it.\n\nAgain, this is not an endorsement of letting her do this. If you start feeling guilty about it, know that if I saw your sis walking down the aisle in a wedding dress at ANY point at your wedding, I would assume she was a garbagefire person and you were a saint so in a way  refusing her is actually protecting her. Every single one of my friends and coworkers would know this story if I witnessed something insane like that.", "OMG. OP, I must say that you have a magnanimous heart to be even considering this!! \n\nAs someone pointed out, you did the responsible thing of waiting and having a wedding when you are financially secure; thus being able to pay for your own wedding. You shouldn't have to take on more responsibilities.\n\nAs I said in my other comment, your sister can definitely have a nice vow renewal ceremony when she can afford it but your wedding shouldn't be the place and time to have her \"magical moment\".", "If she hijacks have your wedding party ready with totally snide comments to shout out.", "OP, what is happening here is the act of Forcing someone until they just give in.\n\n I know that it is hard to tell No to someone, let alone someone you love. But sometimes, it is what you have to do. \n\nI can see that your sister and her husband really have some growing up to do. The fact that they are badgering you and your fiance just proves my point. I think it is very important to hold your ground; now more than ever.\n\nTrust me, I love my sister too. A lot. But such behavior is definitely unacceptable and someone needs to be an adult and tell her No.", "Welp can\u2019t help it if her husband doesn\u2019t want to.", "When I was in college my parents weren\u2019t well off, but when my sister was my grandmother had passed and left a large sum of money to my parents and sister. My grappas the one who helped pay for my college when I desperately needed food or books.", "I\u2019m just unsure how, since I can\u2019t afford to host my wedding and also one for her, which is what it feels like she wants tbh\u2026", "That\u2019s a brilliant idea! I\u2019ll ask if she would be ok with having a smaller party a few hours BEFORE my wedding, but using the same place and setting. I also wouldn\u2019t mind sharing my after party with her, as I am more of an introvert and don\u2019t want too much attention on me all night, while she\u2019s admittedly more of an active participant in parties.", "He claims it\u2019s too soon and people would assume he cheated or something like and that\u2019s the only reason people renew vows.", "You owe her nothing.", "It might be a bit soon but like how would one think it\u2019s from cheating?", "I\u2019m not sure, I think his reasoning is that renewing vows means something happened to make the original ones void or something"]}
