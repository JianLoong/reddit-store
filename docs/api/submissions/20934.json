Heck, I could imagine your family being overjoyed to go to two ceremonies.\n\nI think your sister made poor decisions and is watching you make calculated ones and is trying to figure out how to squeeze in some sparkle for herself on your dime. Lots of people have managed to figure out how to have a jazzed up wedding day on low income, I've seen it. There's lots of saving, waiting, renting, and thrifting involved, and maybe lowering some expectations a bit, but it's doable.\n\nYou don't have to share your moment with anyone except for your special person.

Do not give in. You have been saving up and planning this day for a while now and you and your fianc\u00e9 absolutely deserve to have it dedicated to yourselves. This is not a small thing like borrowing your necklace for a night out. She wants your wedding. The wedding you\u2019ve been planning and saving for. She wants to replace you and your fianc\u00e9 in your wedding. Seriously, what do you think will happen if she walks down the aisle in a bridal gown?

You should have a friend on standby to wrangle her into another non bridal dress afterwards so you don't even have to worry about it.\n\nAgain, this is not an endorsement of letting her do this.

It might be different when you\u2019re still at your parents\u2019 mercy, but I assume that\u2019s not the case anymore.

Read this essay on unnecessary guilt. I found this on Reddit a long time ago and saved it because it\u2019s brilliant.\n\n_________\n\nFor the feelings of doubt and guilt you are experiencing: \nGuilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

Therapy.", "The fact that you mother thinks thst you are an AH for not sharing your wedding with your already married sister tells me everything I need to know about how they feel about you and her. \n\nYour sister chose to get marriedyoung, poor, and in a hurry. She had the wedding to match that. If she wants something different she can save, like you did, and have a big 10 year vow renewal. \n\nIt's also very telling that the people calling you an AH are the people that would likely be going out of pocket for her big dream wedding. They aren't an AH for not wanting to fund it but they sure as hell are because they expect you to dim your light that day to make her shine at your own financial expense.", "If you read through the comments, the parents support the sister in everything she does and leave op to fend for herself.\nOp needs strangers telling them this is not normal family dynamics and they deserve better and not to hand her wedding over to her sister like her parents and sister want.", "I'd probably uninvite her from the wedding. Then have security on the doors to make sure she can't come in. As it doesn't sound like she'll take no for an answer, and she's probably going to come dressed in a wedding dress regardless of what you say.", "NTA AT ALL! \n\nFor anyone missing out on OPs comments, here is a summary:\n- Stacy was born after the mother had a miscarriage so mother has always favored her (OP is in therapy now)\n- OPs father died recently of cancer\n- OPs grandmother died and left OP and Stacy with money. OP put it towards savings and her apartment while Stacy spent the money on partying, nice dorms and clothing as well as paying for college.\n- Stacy dropped out of college to become a housewife (no she doesn\u2019t have any kids) \n- When OP bought a home Stacy asked to HAVE the apartment OP owned\n- Stacy asks OP and their mother money for hundreds of dollars a month in groceries and other expenses\n- the wedding dress that Stacy is planning on wearing down the aisle costs $500-$2000 but Stacy can\u2019t afford a wedding fist and OP even had to pay for her hotel even though she only lives 1-2 hours away \n- Stacy has refused to help OP with anything wedding related, going to pick out flowers, taste food\n- Stacy\u2019s husband has been messaging OPs husband almost daily about this \n- it\u2019s always been OPs dream to have this big wedding\n\nIn my opinion: OP seems very considerate and really does care for her sister. On the other hand I believe Stacy is walking all over OP \u2014 Stacy cannot afford a gift, has to have a hotel for the wedding within driving distance from her house but OP needs to pay for it, asks OP and her mother to give her hundreds of dollars monthly but at the last time can afford a $500-$2000 dress? \nI understand that it can be difficult to see your sister struggle but the support OP has been providing her isn\u2019t helping her. I believe Stacy needs tough love, provide her the same support as now but please cut off any financial support, whether that is monetary or itemized. Stacy had free college that she chose to drop out of, Stacy chose to have a small wedding; Stacy chose to be a housewife. These chores are not OPs fault or responsibility to assist with. \nOP, your wedding is your dream. You have spent years saving up and probably years planning. You are not selfish to want it to be about you. You deserve a day where you are recognized and it\u2019s all about you. \nAlso, please have a backup plan if your sister comes in a wedding dress - ex. Let her know, if you come in a wedding dress or pull any shenanigans I will have one of my fianc\u00e9s friends kick you out.", "Lol she's 21 and she married someone she'd been dating for 5 months. That 5th anniversary isn't happening. But maybe she can start saving for the next marriage.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to take advantage of the fact you and your fiance actually spent time and money planning a wedding. Your relatives need to pull their heads out of their asses because who in their right mind thinks they should get to walk down the aisle in a wedding dress to their husband at SOMEONE ELSE'S WEDDING?\n\nIf your sister really wants to have the whole bridal experience, she and her partner need to do what you did and just save the money for their own big ceremony. They can have a lovely vow renewal down the line.\n\nDon't cave to your AH relatives. This is a day to celebrate you and your fiance, not any opportunists who might try to hijack it.", "Yeah and they make it sound like op is super rich and the money fell from the skies right to her pocket when she has stated that she has been working since 16!", "Its really not, you just have the backbone of an infant", "none of this is funny. you are laughing about being a doormat and letting your sister use and abuse you. it\u2019s getting hard to root for you when you continue to let her do this to you at the expense of not just you but your fianc\u00e9. it\u2019s like you forget that this isn\u2019t just your life but your fianc\u00e9s too and none of this is fair to him either.", "I would not do this. You are paying for your own pre-wedding pictures. She had her wedding. That was her choice. Nothing is stopping her from having another church wedding. She can easily have one at minimal cost with a cake and  coffee reception in church community room. Or a backyard. She can walk down the aisle a different day. Somebody else can take those pictures. Hell I\u2019d offer to buy the cake if it got her off my back.", "bridesmaids and groomsmen are part of the wedding ceremony, there to celebrate the couple. Her sister wants to haver her own mini ceremony on OPs day, completely different", "this! she continues to make excuses in her comments and ignoring the fact that this isn\u2019t just about her but het fianc\u00e9 too. it\u2019s really hard to root for someone who won\u2019t even attempt to understand the other side and put her foot down for her sake and her fianc\u00e9s. like this is his wedding too and he\u2019s now being harassed by the sister and her husband, how is that fair to him?", "Amen. It's obvious she's been conditioned to roll over and take whatever the sister dishes out, and as a recovering people pleaser I have sympathy up to a point, but what people pleasers don't seem to realize is that their \"selflessness\" actually affects the people around them who love or depend on them. In this case, the victim of that sacrifice is OP's fiance.", "just so you know, your extended family will probably be mentally rolling their eyes at your sister mooching off of you and getting everything she wants like a little princess behind your backs for this.", "exactly, that selflessness will always come at a cost to someone and it\u2019s clearly her fianc\u00e9. i mean they\u2019re likely splitting costs and op is out here offering to share the pre wedding party when it\u2019s not just hers. the poor fianc\u00e9 has made his feelings clear but it seems like none of that matters to her if it means keeping her shitty sister happy. it\u2019s sad and it makes op the AH for trying to try start their married life like this.", "Then how is she affording a wedding dress?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need a hotel. A 1-2 hour drive is totally doable.", "Have you talked to your therapist about THIS?  Emergency appointment ASAP", "Absolutely", "Hell no!  Recommended the photographer's services for ANOTHER day.  Sister should not be playing bride at the wedding in any capacity PERIOD. \n\nIf mom wants her to have a bridal photoshoot, she can pay for that like she paid for her education.", "\u201c\u2026finding a compromise with her\u201d - Are you supposed to compromise with people who want to put on a wedding dress and walk down the aisle at your wedding? Are you from a country or culture where this is a typical occurrence or something? I\u2019m Chicago-born and raised with Indian/Pakistani parents and I can pretty confidently say this isn\u2019t normal in an American, Indian, or Pakistani wedding.", "For real. Is OP always going to be doing whatever her sister demands of her for the rest of her life? If I were her fiance and she bent in any way towards allowing this BS to happen, I'd be out.", "so this is his dream too and you seem happy to let your sister stomp all over that. you really need to open your eyes and see how unfair you are being to your fianc\u00e9 to appease your sister. it\u2019s so disappointing and the fact that you are ignoring your fianc\u00e9s needs is so selfish.", "By compromise I meant \"not wearing a wedding dress\". Couldn't have made that any clearer.", "I mean, that still doesn\u2019t answer the question. I see you are in Galway - is it common in Ireland for married women to walk down the aisle at other people\u2019s weddings because they didn\u2019t like their own enough? In America, this would be a laughable request at the absolute best.", "The therapist isn't doing their job.", "That family has caused and enabled this narcissism for decades now. It's not going to go away before this wedding. It's a systems problem that the OP isn't strong enough to buck, even with the help of her well-meaning fiance. He's a bit of a weakling, too, it seems. He could really help out if he put his foot down and said, \"Enough! We are not going to talk about this any more. No one comes to the wedding who pursues us about this.\" Then he says to OP, \"STOP. Just stop. Either you stop this craziness and marry me, or you don't do either. We will postpone the wedding until you stop entertaining this sick pattern.\" And then *he* doesn't listen to any of the whinng from OP.\n\nThis family is sick, and the groom, if he's not having second thoughts, needs to step up. If he can't step up, he's letting the sickness contaminate him, too. It's not that the wedding is ruined. The wedding is emblematic of  all that is wrong with this family. They need a master family therapist (they exist, but are few) to work with the whole lot of them. And that is not going to happen."]}
