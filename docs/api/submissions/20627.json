My husband at the time didn\u2019t work which caused us to struggle for money and eventually led to him abandoning me and our 3 children (9f, 7f and 5m). Because of this, my parents (65m and 64f) offered to let us move back in with them for a while.\n\nEverything was fine, but after a few weeks I noticed that the food being given to us was both unhealthy and given in very large quantities. I didn\u2019t want to offend my mom so instead of bringing it up with her, I offered to do some of the cooking instead. However, she insisted it was all done by her because she \u201cenjoys it\u201d. Reluctantly, I obliged and just thought \u201cI\u2019ll just leave most of it\u201d. The problem with this, is that she started offering anything I didn\u2019t eat to the children who ALWAYS ate ALL of it since they didn\u2019t realise how bad it was for them. I also didn\u2019t want to talk about this with the children because creating a fear about gaining weight always does more harm than good.\n\nThis carried on for about a year before I finally brought it up with her. I\u2019ve gained almost 50 pounds and am now almost obese and 2 of the children are clinically obese now as well with the youngest still being firmly overweight. All of them get a reasonable amount of exercise but it makes little difference when they\u2019re eating almost 3000 calories a day. A few weeks ago I watched their school sports day and it was worrying how little they could run. The 2 girls couldn\u2019t even run 100m and had to walk the final part. \n\nI told my mom she had to stop giving us so much unhealthy food but she snapped at me and said I should be grateful that she\u2019s even letting us stay there. I hate conflict so I ended up backing down but I feel really bad about the effect it\u2019s having on my kids.

This weekend my parents were visiting us, they live 100km away, so they usually only visit us 1-2 times a month. We want to raise our child with focus on bounding orientated education and dealing with it, what it is: a human being, that needs love, and respect and safety. On the weekend, my mother constantly tickled her on the feet, or touched her on the cheek or held a toy constantly in front of her head, so she can learn to grasp it. \n\nHowever, tickling the feet is an attack on the souveranity of the baby. Who in the right mind, would do that to an adult? Or touch you on the cheek? Noone. It's disrepectful. Its worse with a baby. It can not defend itself from it. It has no voice to speak against it. \n\nIt's kind of the same with you children: They don't know whats best for them. As a parent, you know whats best for your kids. I myself have to learn to step up against my parents and set boundaries for them.\n\nThe same with the toy: a 3 month old is not used to have a toy in front of her for 3 hours a day. She was actually tired of it, but could not speak up for herself. At the end of the day, she needed 2 hours of crying out loud all the frustration she experience during the day until she calmed down. \n\nTLDR: You as a parend are responsible for your child. Not your grandparents. If they dont respect your boundaries, leave. You founded this family, not them. You want to raise them and give them lots of opportunities to grow and to be succesful in life.

My family (when I was the child) lived an extremely similar life for a few years and you never feel like you have the strength to tell your parents no because they are being the primary provider. When you go to wrap up the food, your kids will beg for more and your mom will say look at them, they\u2019re scrawny, let them eat. \n\nYou need to beat them with science. You have to take them to the pediatrician and have the doctor tell them, and write up so you can show tour mom, or even have a 3 way call that they are rapidly becoming obese for such a young age and it\u2019s not ok. You have to follow the recommended daily servings for your children from here on out and absolutely take the food away and wrap it up, calling an end to the night. Extra food gets frozen or given away (my family also made huge meals that generated huge waste). If your mother is refusing, you need to issue an ultimatum. Tell her she will see as little of you and the kids as possible when you move out if this continues. Start now. Schedule as many playdates and extracurriculars as you can. And you need to get a better job or help from social services so you can make good on that ultimatum. If you have stats from when you moved in, and how much worse their blood and weight has gotten over the past two years, you can even consult with a social worker on how to approach the situation. \n\nI am a person who believes kids should have a large amount of independence for sure. But as someone who grew up incredibly skinny ONLY because of my ridiculous metabolism and grew overweight as an adult and now has an eating disorder, I would never wish this on a teenager.\n\nThat said, restricted eating IS serious and CAN mess with your child\u2019s psyche and you need to make SURE it\u2019s recommended by the doctor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Almond Moms suck, but so do Fried Chicken Moms.", "Can you also see that OP is Grandma's child?\n\nDo you, even as an adult, feel comfortable \"talking back,\" to your mother?", "Your kids should absolutely be going to the pediatrician.\n\nBy social services I meant food stamps, 8a housing, tax breaks, etc.\n\nGood luck", "This is true. Thanks for the suggestion.", "My mom won\u2019t give smaller portions because the children keep eating them. If anything they are getting larger. The children don\u2019t get seconds, the first helpings are just very big. I do agree the current situation is bad though.", "I haven\u2019t really looked into child support so I\u2019ll see if I can get that. I\u2019ll try and bring it up with my mom but she can be very controlling and cooking is one of her favourite hobbies so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be successful.", "Good advice! Thank you for talking real without shaming Mom.", "I don\u2019t know how to approach it with my children without it having an effect on their mental health. I guess I never taught them how to say no to food since I never gave them too much before.", "I don\u2019t think I will be able to stop my mom from cooking but maybe teaching the children to not eat the entire serving would work. As for me not eating the entire serving, she gives anything I don\u2019t eat to the kids and I would much rather a pound of fat on my waistline than on my child\u2019s.", "I can\u2019t afford to move out. I\u2019ve got a job but it\u2019s basically minimum wage so I\u2019m saving up. It looks like it could still be over a year away though.", "I think teaching the kids portion control is the best way! I\u2019ll do that.", "Thanks! That\u2019s a good way to explain it to them!", "Thanks!", "I did let her know but she always says \u201cif they\u2019re full they\u2019ll stop eating\u201d. I\u2019ve told her to reduce mine as well but she says \u201canything you don\u2019t finish the children can eat\u201d.", "That\u2019s literally what she did and pretty much everyone YTA\u2019d her in return.", "How?", "None of my kids were ever that into sport but they didn\u2019t mind it when they were able to run around for hours. The main challenge is starting. As for myself, I\u2019ll try my best but I\u2019ve never been very athletic so it may be a struggle.", "Well it's about 50% more than you should be eating, so hardly insignificant (2000 calories a day for women)", "I know I can if I really apply myself. It\u2019s my children I\u2019m most worried about.", "Omg, it's s huge amount! Especially for s child!", "Word. Sometimes reddit *does* surprise me in shockingly positive ways.", "I highly doubt that your mother is a monster that would throw you in the street for asking for smaller portions for your kids. For your kid\u2019s sake, you really need to learn to speak up. You are their advocate. You are supposed to protect them, not to shut up to not hurt your mother\u2019s feelings. You kid\u2019s health is way more important than your mom\u2019s feelings. You need to get your priorities straight", "Then if that's the route you're choosing to take, that's your fault. Again, you're a grown woman in your mid-30s, far too old to bend to pressure.", "Then you pick up your plate as soon as you have eaten the amount you want to eat and throw what you don\u2019t eat away. So there\u2019s no option to give it to the kids. I hate food waste, and your mom probably does to, but you may have to do it to get the point across. And that teaches the kids that when they\u2019re done, there\u2019s an option to be done. \n\nOP - my first roommate had incredibly disordered eating from her parents expecting clean plates. Somehow your kids now seem to have that mindset. (I\u2019m not saying it was done to them, or that you did something to cause that, but it is what is happening). Perhaps a nutritionist is in order to help them learn their limits, since they don\u2019t seem to know them right now.", "2 years on in the future after the damage is done... If she knew the cooking was making her kids fat then she should have acted at the begining, the fact she is blaming her mother now either means she didnt know the portion sizes were too large until now and therefore cant expect her mother to realise either or she did know and has subjected herself and her kids to an unhealthy diet knowingly for 2 years.", "Cook for you and your kids.", "Typically people don\u2019t recognize food made themselves fat/others fat until a certain point. That\u2019s how people get obese. So I still don\u2019t understand why every is YTA\u2019ing her when it is quite clear her mother would have snapped at her if she brought it up earlier. In fact, she probably would have gotten YTA\u2019d harder because everyone would have said \u201cwhy would you assume that your nice mother\u2019s cooking would make your kids obese?\u201d or something to that effect?", "I didn\u2019t want to bring up a problem immediately after moving in because I\u2019d seem ungrateful. I brought it up when I felt it was getting out of control which I admit, was too late.", "My mom won\u2019t let me. She wants to do it all.", "I think my mom just wants to feel important to the children\u2019s lives so insists she cooks so she feels she is helping.", "Let\u2019s be real. If the scenario was different and you brought this up with your mom earlier and she snapped, they would have still YTA\u2019d you for assuming your mom\u2019s cooking would make your kids obese and say that your mom was right for snapping because there was no evidence that her food was having an adverse affect on your kids."]}
