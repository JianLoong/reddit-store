My husband at the time didn\u2019t work which caused us to struggle for money and eventually led to him abandoning me and our 3 children (9f, 7f and 5m). Because of this, my parents (65m and 64f) offered to let us move back in with them for a while.\n\nEverything was fine, but after a few weeks I noticed that the food being given to us was both unhealthy and given in very large quantities. I didn\u2019t want to offend my mom so instead of bringing it up with her, I offered to do some of the cooking instead. However, she insisted it was all done by her because she \u201cenjoys it\u201d. Reluctantly, I obliged and just thought \u201cI\u2019ll just leave most of it\u201d. The problem with this, is that she started offering anything I didn\u2019t eat to the children who ALWAYS ate ALL of it since they didn\u2019t realise how bad it was for them. I also didn\u2019t want to talk about this with the children because creating a fear about gaining weight always does more harm than good.\n\nThis carried on for about a year before I finally brought it up with her. I\u2019ve gained almost 50 pounds and am now almost obese and 2 of the children are clinically obese now as well with the youngest still being firmly overweight. All of them get a reasonable amount of exercise but it makes little difference when they\u2019re eating almost 3000 calories a day. A few weeks ago I watched their school sports day and it was worrying how little they could run. The 2 girls couldn\u2019t even run 100m and had to walk the final part. \n\nI told my mom she had to stop giving us so much unhealthy food but she snapped at me and said I should be grateful that she\u2019s even letting us stay there. I hate conflict so I ended up backing down but I feel really bad about the effect it\u2019s having on my kids.

This weekend my parents were visiting us, they live 100km away, so they usually only visit us 1-2 times a month. We want to raise our child with focus on bounding orientated education and dealing with it, what it is: a human being, that needs love, and respect and safety. On the weekend, my mother constantly tickled her on the feet, or touched her on the cheek or held a toy constantly in front of her head, so she can learn to grasp it. \n\nHowever, tickling the feet is an attack on the souveranity of the baby. Who in the right mind, would do that to an adult? Or touch you on the cheek? Noone. It's disrepectful. Its worse with a baby. It can not defend itself from it. It has no voice to speak against it. \n\nIt's kind of the same with you children: They don't know whats best for them. As a parent, you know whats best for your kids. I myself have to learn to step up against my parents and set boundaries for them.\n\nThe same with the toy: a 3 month old is not used to have a toy in front of her for 3 hours a day. She was actually tired of it, but could not speak up for herself. At the end of the day, she needed 2 hours of crying out loud all the frustration she experience during the day until she calmed down. \n\nTLDR: You as a parend are responsible for your child. Not your grandparents. If they dont respect your boundaries, leave. You founded this family, not them. You want to raise them and give them lots of opportunities to grow and to be succesful in life. Your parents are in the way of those opportunities. Stand Up for yourself and your family!", "Based on the new info I\u2019m going with NAH. Your mom stepped up and is helping you.

I understand your situation completely and it\u2019s awful, I\u2019m sorry. My family (when I was the child) lived an extremely similar life for a few years and you never feel like you have the strength to tell your parents no because they are being the primary provider. When you go to wrap up the food, your kids will beg for more and your mom will say look at them, they\u2019re scrawny, let them eat. \n\nYou need to beat them with science. You have to take them to the pediatrician and have the doctor tell them, and write up so you can show tour mom, or even have a 3 way call that they are rapidly becoming obese for such a young age and it\u2019s not ok. You have to follow the recommended daily servings for your children from here on out and absolutely take the food away and wrap it up, calling an end to the night. Extra food gets frozen or given away (my family also made huge meals that generated huge waste). If your mother is refusing, you need to issue an ultimatum. Tell her she will see as little of you and the kids as possible when you move out if this continues. Start now. Schedule as many playdates and extracurriculars as you can. And you need to get a better job or help from social services so you can make good on that ultimatum. If you have stats from when you moved in, and how much worse their blood and weight has gotten over the past two years, you can even consult with a social worker on how to approach the situation. \n\nI am a person who believes kids should have a large amount of independence for sure. But as someone who grew up incredibly skinny ONLY because of my ridiculous metabolism and grew overweight as an adult and now has an eating disorder, I would never wish this on a teenager.\n\nThat said, restricted eating IS serious and CAN mess with your child\u2019s psyche and you need to make SURE it\u2019s recommended by the doctor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe try joining a gym instead?", "YTA\n\nYou are the parent. You are responsible for their health, not your mum. If the portion sizes are too big, have a conversation with your children about health and not eating as much. There are child friendly ways to approach this topic that won't cause eating disorders. Teach them about moderation, exercise, healthy vs unhealthy foods. Being educated about food doesn't cause eating disorders but your inaction is. If the food is unhealthy, set firm boundaries with your mun that you will cook for the kids. It's your responsibility to make sure they get good food, not your mums. Buy some healthier foods once a week or star exercising with them more. To be honest, it sounds like the one who has a bad relationship with food is you. You're so afraid to even talk to your children about health, food and weight that you've neglected them instead. This is 100% your fault. However, some advice. Feel free to ask questions. \n\n\nLook up child friendly resources to teach this topic. I don't know why you think you need to bring up weight. You don't. What you need to talk about it health because, remember, everyone is healthy at different weights. Don't say 'Eating this will make you fat and that's bad'. Say 'This food can damage your body in large amounts so we need to be careful how much we eat'. Don't say 'You need to work out to lose weight', say 'Exercise keeps your lungs and heart strong'. You can teach moderation and also talk about how different things require different foods. For example, my mum is a long distance runner so before a race, she eats lots of carbs and sugar. This isn't bad because it's important for her body, whereas eating that daily would be bad for you if you don't exercise.\n\nTry to engage your children in exercise. They can join a class or, if that's too expensive, do things at home. Follow along yoga videos or daily workouts. Try to vet the videos first so that they focus on health, don't let them watch 'how to burn fat!' type videos because that places the importance on weight, not health. Let them devise their own weekly plan of activities. As long as it's active, it really doesn't matter if it's a 'proper' workout or an hour running round the park.\n\nTeach them bodily autonomy and how to listen to their body. It's really important to be able to identify what your body needs. For example, a lot of the time when we think we're hungry, we're actually thirsty so encourage them to have a drink and wait 10 minutes instead of reaching for snacks. Also, have a drink before eating. Encourage them to eat slowly and to understand when they're full, not just eating because the food is there. Teach them that it's ok to refuse food or say no to large portions. My mum always gives us huge portions then gets upset that we don't eat them but I've learned to say no.\n\nTeach them about weight! I know this seems scary and contradictory but it's important that they learn this from a safe source, not from someone horrible online. Teach them that being overweight can be unhealthy but so can being very underweight. Teach them that everyone's ideal weight is different and you shouldn't judge those who's ideal weight is larger or smaller. Teach them that people's value isn't related to their weight and it's rude to comment on it. Teach them some reasons that people get fat that aren't 'their fault', like medical illnesses or disabilities that limit movement. Teach them to still be kind to fat people and to not judge themselves by their size. It's important that they learn this too.\n\nEngage them with cooking. Kids will be more inclined to eat healthier foods if they've helped. There are great ways to teach young children to cook or use tools. Even something as simple as washing veg or stirring a pan can help them feel involved. Laura Love has a brilliant gentle parenting page that approaches this.", "YTA. \n\nIt is your job to teach your children to not gorge themselves.\n\nIt is your job to ensure you are setting a healthy example. \n\nIt is your job to control your own calorie intake. \n\nA little personal responsibility isn't hard.\n\nEdit: Reading your comments is just laughable.
