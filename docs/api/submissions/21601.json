I do not use it to do things like violate school policies on parent sign-in or who can be on the grounds when. That's crazy and inappropriate.", "NTA she's delusional and acting weird for no reason", "NTA\n\nYour mom is disillusional and is pissed that you aren't on board in it.", "If your brother's around 17 and she's not yet 50, she didn't have you later in life, at least not from my perspective. But my mom was 40 when I was born, and in middle school at least one kid assumed she was my grandmother. :) \n\nAnyway, NTA, that's embarrassing and childish behavior for her to want to blend in with teenagers (which she definitely doesn't). The weird pickup at school is typical annoying mom stuff, but it's not okay for her to yell at you, insult you, and run away to her sister's. Pretty immature for an adult woman.", "NTA.  The behavior your mother is exhibiting is highly narcissistic.", "NTA, she seems weird and as if she\u2019s in denial that she\u2019s getting older. Also extremely childish of her to insult her own kids and drive off to stay the night somewhere? She needs to grow up lol.", "NTA but you're wasting your energy.

I will say YTA because of your lack of knowledge of human behaviors. Your mom is trying to hold on to something that she feels is slipping from her because of what she's been taught about youth and looks. American culture is based on looks, and as a woman, I can relate to that feeling myself. Is your mom a single parent? \n\nYou can put yourself in your mom's shoes because you identified yourself as the weird kid. Weird is just not doing what is popular to do. That doesn't mean you're weird. It just means you're your own person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you have any aunts, uncles or family friends that could talk some sense into her? Anyone you trust to talk about this with who is an adult? Her reaction seems overly dramatic and selfish and this is not good parenting. \n\nHopefully you and your brother aren't far off from being able to live away from her soon.", "Your mom is a narcissist. Be careful of that in future relationships.", "She is, no question. She was raised in a big family with 8 other sisters and no parent to give her attention, so I think it's why she behaves like it. it's just the attention and compliments she never got as a kid.", "She usually goes to her sister's house if we do something or say something she don't like.", "I got asked if I had graduated high school or not yet? by an 19 yo friend of my baby cousin once. I was 25 and ended up stammering that I had, and college too.", "Question, how is OP TA when his mom disregards her childrens feelings?", "She is a single parent\n\nShe is insecure, I get it because her comments towards me about being fat and friendless have made me feel insecure. I just don't think her insecurity should make her act like this and ignore what my brother and I are trying to tell her", "it'd be different if they were dragging her down, however they dimple said it makes them uncomfortable when she goes to their school?", "Op's mom is doing something she know makes her kids uncomfortable, she emotionally abuses and bullies them, and abandons them when they say something she doesn't like.  Op is in no way an AH.  You doing like you would enable op's mom's abuse", "Oof, I'm sorry to hear that. Because that is very unusual behavior for a parent. Kinda sounds like an upgraded version of the \"silent treatment\" that narcissists love to use.\n\nAt least, it's impossible for her to actually enroll in your high school. I hate to say this, but when you're dealing with a narcissist that's also your parent, you really have to pick your battles. It doesn't seem worth the mental debuffs and backlash from your mom to keep trying to pop her reality distortion bubble.", "That is so weird to me. Like, you guys are old enough to spend a night on your own I think, but just to up and leave your kids to punish them? What kind of parents does that?", "...so your mom regularly abandons y'all and sulks like a toddler?", "I and my kid once got pulled out of a pool by lifeguards and I was told I needed to be 18 to supervise a younger child in the pool.\n\nI was in my late 30s ...", "You're right. Insecurities shouldn't make a person do something, but they do. Insecurities control many people's emotions, and that controls our speech. I'm sorry she insults you.", "It just sucks, like I don't wanna tell my mom how young and beautiful she is because I don't think it's my place as her child, but at the same time she calls my brother and I fat, friendless, ugly and the 'r' word a lot. like I don't get why she can't get her insecurities under control for her own children, but instead tries to put them in us", "Yeah she's done this since we we're little, so I think it's just habit she can't break at this point", "Op your mother is emotionally/ verbally abusive.  Bide your time and plan your exit for when you are older", "Yup, you're right about how completely unfair that is for her to require you to validate you while constantly putting you down. That would be a horrible way for her to treat any of her adult friends--the fact she does that to you and your brother, her children, is disgusting. She's expecting you to be the parent in the relationship.\n\nUnfortunately, narcissists are just... awful. They cannot be reasoned with, because they do not live in the same reality that you and your brother and everyone else do. Even if you took her to a plastic surgeon to explain all the procedures it would take to make her \"look younger, but you'll never look like a teenager again,\" I doubt that would sink in.\n\nI hope you and your brother stay close and are able to support each other through your high school years. If I were in your shoes, I would start planning with him on how the two of you can move out without needing your mom's financial support.\n\nAnd, seriously, I mean it with the good luck. I had a narcissistic mom and an enabler dad, and the teenage years were the absolute worst. I had three undiagnosed chronic pain conditions (endometriosis, dislocated hip from a sports injury that my parents did not take me to the right doctor for, and celiac). I could only start getting the diagnoses once I moved out of my parents' house. For me, therapy helped a lot--you and your brother might want to look into that, but your first priority is going to be financial independence from your mom.\n\nMaybe this advice is a bit \"oh shit, my mom isn't really that bad\" but on the off chance the situation you posted about is just the tip of the iceberg of insanity that is your mom... yeah, you two can survive this shit and get out.", "NTA but having children at age 33-35 isn't exactly \"later in life.\"", " NTA. Your mom is deranged. Call someone to help you all out. She sounds delusional. Maybe needs to be evaluated.  So sad.", "NTA, long overdue reality check", "NTA. She's delusional and publicly embarrassing you. I would tell her she's fifty and looks it everytime she brings it up.", "Is it bad that I saw this comment and immediately thought she sounds vain enough that she might think the Carly Simon song is about her?\n\nAdmittedly, while reading the post, I also thought someone might need to tell her she's not Stacy's Mom.\n\nFor that matter, it might help if she's told that neither The Mod Squad or 21 Jump Street have any open positions on their teams.", "I was looking for this comment, I couldn\u2019t get past the opening sentence! Having kids MUCH later in life, at the advanced age of like\u2026 32. What?!", "OP is firmly NTA. The fact that you say she is because a 14 year old isn't \"putting herself in her mom's shoes\" is ridiculous. At 14 you're going through puberty and figuring out how to handle your own insecurities. At almost 50, mom should be helping her child, not the other way around.", "I\u2019m sorry that you have an abusive raging narcissist for a mother.\n\nCan you talk to someone at school?\n\nThere\u2019s also /r/raisedbynarcissists", "That\u2019s pretty illegal", "I\u2019m assuming they have a father and she\u2019s not just leaving them alone.", "Says she\u2019s a single mum", "Mildly YTA.  Look...  your mother is at an age where beauty tends to fade.  She is clearly insecure about this; seems her looks are important to her.  I'd argue that it is unkind and disrespectful to tell her to stop going on about it, that it's \"annoying\".  If she wants to claim she looks like a high school student, just let it go.  It's not like she doesn't know, deep down.\n\nAnd as to \"embarrassing\"...  well.  There are *very, very few* teenagers who don't find their parents embarrassing.  That's just part of the teen lifecycle.", "NTA. Your mother is probably a narcissist. Very difficult to handle as her child. Maybe look up the symptoms and how to deal with such a mother. She will probably not change.", "Only thing that probably looks like a teenager about her would be her attitude. NTA.", "Wow she is unhinged and not in touch with reality.. NTA", "NTA. She may not be teenage but she is acting less mature than my teenage son.", "Teenagers think 30 is practically geriatric.
