You deserve so much better, I'm not going to say cut them off or go low contact but I am going to really encourage you to take a step back and really think about what *you* get from this relationship. Is it worth it? Do you really feel loved? I wish you the best and hope you make the best decision for yourself, also I recommend therapy if you haven't gotten into it yet. Therapy isn't a miracle cure all but a good therapist will help you by giving you the tools to cope or to stand up for yourself. Good luck and Happy birthday!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI suggest go complete NC with your family. If u even have an ounce of self-respect, you will disown them.

Gets a lot of shit from white people for being smelly due to the steelworks, and due to the relatively high crime rate compared to surrounding small towns.\n\nIt's no different from a lot of industrial cities in the US, but Gary takes more shit for reasons.

To go from South Bend to Chicago, you have have pass through Gary. As a kid in the 80's you knew you entered Gary by the smell. The steel mills smelt HORRIBLE! \n\nWe went to Chicago 2-4 times a year and even with 3 kids I don't remember a single time we ever stopped in Gary. \n\nNow Gary is just rundown and crime invested.", "Nothing to do with racism. Back in the 70s and 80 Gary Indiana was actually toxic. I remember just driving through in the mid 80's and getting a monster headache and nausea from the smell. The air was so bad you often couldn't see a hundred yards or less ahead when driving through.\n\nEven though the industry has moved and the air quality improved the land and water is still contaminated. It has a high rate of cancers and respiratory disease. So its still toxic, just not as obvious.", "ESH\nIT sounds like you didn't do much organising as you weren't involved in the booking.\nYou volunteered to be left behind and you're suprised/upset they took that option you offered?\n\nYour parents and siblings sound entited and selfish but none f you look good here, in my view.", "NTA\n\nAnd as hard as this will be to hear, your family clearly doesn't love you.\n\nThat's not your fault, and based on what you've described you seem a far nicer person that they could ever hope to be.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. You deserve better.", " NTA. Shit family you\u2019ve got there. Sorry, Bud.", "NTA, You don't have a family. You have some people that assume you work for them. I would go LC.

People will treat you how you let them treat you.  It's hard, but you gotta teach them to treat you better.  And maybe that means you move out, stop helping so much and start living for you.", "NTA.  As one eldest daughter to another, it's amazing how freeing incompetence can be.  Just stop being able to do stuff for them.  Don't refuse, just do it very badly or forget to do it.  Also, if you are such a high achiever, get your own place!", "NTA but Are you sure they aren't trying to surprise you for your birthday? I wouldn't rule that out as it seems odd that they would ask you for help planning and then change the plans out of the blue. Maybe they have the original plan and want to surprise you with it. Maybe try telling them that since they won't be there for your birthday you have made alternate plans and see how they react to this.", "NTA OP.  Tell your family that if they want to use your services as a vacation planner without you necessarily going, they\u2019ll have to pay for it.", "NTA\nOh sweetie, I'm so sorry that you are doing through this.\nMy advice is to stop helping them with their things and don't blame yourself for it. \nYou are not their personal assistant, you are their eldest daughter that deserve love and respect.They clearly don't respect your feelings enough and think that \"since you are the eldest, it's okay because adult life it's not easy\" - a very classic and terrible behavior from parents.\nThey will probably get very mad and frustrated when you stop to do everything they ask you, but believe me, it will be for the best. \n(I've been there myself, and it got better over time) \nIf you have friends nearby, make your birthday plans  with them and enjoy your special day.\nFriends are the family we choose :)", "NTA.

This is so frustrating when people don't just clearly say what they mean", "I take it they will want you to drive them to and from the airport as well. It seems intentional. Plan to be busy and unavailable from this point on. Their plans changed and so have yours. Maybe even be out of town so there\u2019s definitely no availability.", "Absolutely NTA, I hope you can tell that now. Just want to say, you don't deserve to be treated this badly.", "Looks to me that your family was organizing the Bali trip without you. You naively thought that they needed your assistance and that you were also included. You put in a lot of unsolicited work They used it and went to Bali without you. It looks like they may do something token for your birthday, but you plan your own thing and don\u2019t include them. All they will be talking about the grand time they had in Bali.

They\u2019ve cast her as a human oil can, making things run smoothly when they\u2019re running hot & friction is wrecking the machine.  I hate that role.", "Yeah I agree with ESH - the family a bit more than the OP. The OP has been conditioned by the family to go straight to \"organizer\" mode as she went straight to assuming she'll help with the booking when the family didn't explicitly ask that they needed help from her. And if she's booking the trip for everyone, she could've easily booked herself into that trip (I mean, she was willing to pay for her own share), but for some reason she felt obligated to also throw the options to leave her out? The family probably also thought, \"we just want this vacay booked\" and didn't want to think about any of those caveats (given it's such short notice) so they went ahead and sorted things out themselves. \ud83d\ude15\n\nIt does suck for OP, and I probably would still go low contact with them, and stop automatically doing things for them unless they explicitly ask, as it just enables their entitled behavior. Regardless, I hope OP still enjoys their birthday without them.", "WHat work did OP do?\n\nIt was all booked without their input apparently.", "Yes just STOP", "Listen,  they've got to learn.

(Of course this hurts like hell but here's the truth). \n\nAlso if 3 kids to Bali in Hilton isn't possible than any loving, caring parents would go somewhere else where this isn't an issue and they can take all 3 of you. \n\nYou are being used and abused by your family. Time to put yourself first OP. Be as mad as you want at them... their behaviour is truly disgusting.\n\nAlso if you can afford look into therapy to get emotional independence from them so they can't use you anymore in the future.", "NTA but seriously stop helping them.

I hope you can still do something fun.  *edit spelling", "NTA but you will be if you keep expecting things from a relationship that will never come.

You did all that planning for them and then your parents are too \"stressed\" to change the room reservation for 3 and leave your behind on your Bday?  Like that would probably take them 15 minutes.
