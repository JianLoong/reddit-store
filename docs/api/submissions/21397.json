I was fine with it, though a little put out as I had already started organising things for my birthday but I was also super excited to being going on a vacation. So whilst my family rang me, mainly my dad ranting about how my mother and sister had bullied him into this trip by organising it without his permission, I set to work helping to book everything. For background, I am the eldest daughter and usually do all the research for family vacations. The trip initially involved a hotel which had extremely bad reviews of mold/dirt which my mum is sensitive to so I spent the day messaging my dad all the hotel alternatives whilst being made vary aware that as a family of 5 (I am the eldest to a set of twins), as the \u201cfifth\u201d member I was complicating bookings a lot, often requiring a third room.\n\nSo I rang my father and said if he absolutely had to they could leave me behind as I knew my sister had already gone ballistic about this trip as all her friends are in Europe but if so that I\u2019d appreciate if they could be home for my birthday. I made it very clear that I didn\u2019t want to sit out and that for only three reasons would I be ok being left behind. 1.If the expense was too much such as requiring an additional expensive room (I did also volunteer to pay for myself) 2.Logistically impossible being the hotel/holiday package couldn\u2019t fit five 3. If the trip would run into my birthday party (scheduled a week after my birthday). The next day I ring my parents and they tell me they have sorted this fantastic trip, with Hilton but that I\u2019m not coming. I was bummed as it meant I\u2019d be alone on my birthday but assumed that being so late notice it must\u2019ve been impossible to include me. I asked them what the struggle was and it was revealed they didn\u2019t even try add me. I was annoyed but I said I\u2019d ring Hilton and see if one room can sleep 3 without any sharing bed, finding out they had a sofa bed which meant it was cheap/easy for me to go. Yet, when I told dad he said it was so stressful making the original booking that he couldn\u2019t be bothered to ring and get the room reservation updated for 3. I rang mum and she said \u201cshe didn\u2019t want three kids in a room\u201d.\n\nI am furious with my family, I feel betrayed that they'd willingly leave me alone on my birthday at such short notice and ditch our plans. I\u2019m angry that they didn\u2019t even try and that even when I patiently found a solution they didn\u2019t have any motivation to include me. I live out of home and constantly organise things for my parents bdays and feel super hurt that despite being a high achiever they constantly gloat about, I am apparently not worth the return effort and that it is especially evil to have your daughter plan trips that you then exclude her from. AITA for getting mad?

That is an horrible thing to do to a child, at any time of the year.

I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nIf I were you I would stop helping them out with things like this. They don't care about you enough to even try to include you. On your birthday too.

It sounds like your family is not meeting your emotional needs, and your constant organizing things and helping out is just adding more stress to the relationship, piling on more favors that they will not return.

Never do another thing for their trips or birthdays. Purchase a card, and if they do something for you, then reciprocate... but at least this year organize nothing. If they ask you to, simply say no ...you cant be bothered to. Took me years to realize that I was putting love and money into my families birthdays while mine was either forgotten or my gift was \"ordered  but never arrived. I cut them off from gifts and oooh boy did they get mad. Not mad enough to buy me a present, but mad enough to squawk their heads off. Now I'm 50 and still send them a card only.", "NTA.  This is a lesson though that your family doesn't appreciate the time and energy you put in to doing things for them.  Your parents are rewarding your sister's shitty behavior and punishing you for her bad behavior and they used you.  Stop doing anything extra for them beyond the necessary", "NTA- They did not care about you. They did not consider about your birthday. They just wanted free work for a vacation.\n\nIt's just me and it's going forward when you are planning your birthday. Do not plan anything around your family as you know they do not prioritize you at all and they have no problem leaving you out.\n\nThis means in the future.  Is hard but your family is showing you how they treat you.\n\nTell them in the future that you're not going to spend your birthday with them as they have no problem with you being all alone and isolated.\n\nOnly do this if you do not rely on them for any resources like schooling or anything like that.

It's time to stop extending courtesies for people who do not reciprocate the effort, take all of it for granted and do not take your feelings into consideration before making selfish decisions.", "NTA. Stop doing things for them. They book a trip, say great and DO NOT RESEARCH IT. Don't let them know your mother will hate the hotel, don't volunteer to do anything. If they state a fact, unless it's an actual question, do not respond. If they ask your opinion, \"I don't know.\" is a valid answer. \n\nI come from a line of passive aggressives, so I've been trained that when someone says, \"The dishes are dirty.\" I end up cleaning them. Turns out, that's not how normal people operate. \n\nDrop the rope. You will find your way. Find a way to celebrate by doing things you like to do.", "NTA\n\nAnd with this, I would stop organizing things for them.

Why?  Does your twin still live at home? \nI agree with others that have posted,  stop doing all that you do for them.  It isn't appreciated & you are being taken for granted. \nRemember- if you allow others to treat you poorly,  you've taught them that their behavior is acceptable.  So even though you are hurt & upset,  if you continue to do & plan things for them,  you've basically said they can treat you that way & you'll continue to help/serve their needs.  \nI'm so sorry,  I hope in spite of your family's hurtful behavior that you will still have a wonderful birthday without them!", "Have you asked them why they would neglect you in this way?
