The pregnancy was very difficult, I was put on bedrest for the last 3 months of it and we were seeing specialists often due to some tests that had come back flagged for abnormalities with the baby (baby turned out to be totally fine, but it was still very stressful). I had intense prenatal depression that would worsen to the point of panic attacks when I had a big jump or drop in oxytocin. Sex quickly became out of the question, because after navigating the limited mobility that I had to engage in sex, I would get these massive drops afterwards where I would feel hopeless, depressed, nauseous, and I would end up sobbing for half an hour until the hormone drop evened out. \nI enjoyed the during, but the after was brutal for us both. \n\nSo after a traumatic birth that ended in an emergency c-section, I\u2019ve had difficulty navigating my new body. We\u2019ve had sex, but it is not nearly as frequent as it was before the pregnancy. In fact, we had a baby free night, slept together, and things got so \u201centhusiastic\u201d that my still fragile cervix tore, and now I\u2019m on a very intense corse of antibiotics and steroids for the tear and subsequent infection. But I digress. \n\nRecently I noticed notifications for a discord server called \u201cnsfw relationships\u201d come up on his phone. I opened it, glanced at the server too quickly to really understand the context, felt guilty, and closed it again. This morning my husbands phone started going off so I reached over to silence it and noticed a message from someone that was rather emotionally intimate. It said \u201cHi XX, I\u2019ve missed you. Do you want to talk today?\u201d \n\n\u2026so I opened it. And what I discovered was a months long chat history with this AI, full of sexual messages, sexual role play, detailed messages on both sides about what they want to do to each other, lots of sexting, asking about if it was pleasurable, you name it. I didn\u2019t read through all of it, just enough to discover that this was not a one time \u201ctrying to test the limits of the AI\u201d thing. It was an intentional and ongoing\u2026borderline relationship he had going on with this AI (who has a young female aviator that interacts when you type). He asks her things like \u201care you comfortable doing this? I want to make sure you know what I want\u201d I felt sick. \n\nI immediately woke him up and asked him about it. He does not believe he\u2019s done anything wrong, and accused me of shaming him for being sexual after he had to go so long without any sex because of the pregnancy and postpartum complications. I feel like this has stepped outside the boundaries of the \u2018normal\u2019 monogamous relationship and that he should have talked to me about it- especially since we have a very open dialogue about sex and always have. I called him a cheater, and said that the same reason he felt it was a \u201ccreative solution\u201d to his sexual activity, is the very reason he should have talked to me first.

I liken this to someone who\u2019s hooked on pornography which may not be bad in itself but when it takes the time away from being with their partner. And it can become a big problem because there could be an escalation if the person spends more time with an outside source such as porn or AI to help them relieve their sexual intentions. then you\u2019re competing with a fantasy. What happens if he goes on this thing every night or instead of spending time with you and the baby start spending more time with his AI as time goes on. And what will happen when or if you go back to having relations like you did before the baby, will he be willing to give up the AI?", "So if you were to read 50 shades of grey or some other romance smut and this worked for you to get your proverbial rocks off then that's ok but a guy chatting to a lewd robot is not ok?\n\nThis is the same shite you hear where female sex toy = perfectly fine and must be accepted and male sex toys =he's a disgusting sick, pathetic pervert.\n\nHe's wasnt trying to hide it, he did nothing wrong. It's no diffennt to a million mills and boon novels out there, just a modern version of it.\n\nSo, YTA.", "ESH. He's been trying to cope with his emotional and physical needs. It's too much to expect this from you right now, as your health and recovery are appropriately higher priorities. Do you really want him acting like a sex pest or a moody baby while your cervix is torn?\n\nHe sucks for not communicating better. You suck for accusing him of cheating. The AI is not a threat to your marriage, but poor communication could be.", "**NAH**\n\nHe needs to find release somewhere and this is essentially the same thing as looking at pornographic stories, is it not?\n\nHis needs aren\u2019t being met so he found a creative way to meet them that is not, by the common definition, cheating\n\nIt\u2019s text based, and there is no \u201cauthor\u201d just a program that guesses what would be a favourable response based on input and criteria\n\nThere is no \u201cliving thing\u201d he is cheating with - it\u2019s not even like he\u2019s *watching* porn\n\nYou have a right to not like it, but I cannot see how you could classify this as cheating when there is no other living creature involved\u2026 how can you be jealous of an algorithm?\n\nDo you believe you are somehow lesser than an algorithm? Do you think *he* believes that?\n\nYou both need to have an honest conversation about needs but don\u2019t throw things around like \u201ccheating\u201d when it clearly *isn\u2019t*", "YTA, though due to overreacting and this is still fixable.\n\nUsing the AI isn't cheating. It's elaborate masturbation and essentially a version of text-based porn.\n\nMaybe he could have talked to you about it, but do you expect him to talk you about his porn habbits as a matter critical to your relationship?", "NAH.\n\nThis is an interesting one. So, people are talking about this from a lot of perspectives, and it *is* a nuanced issue, but I don't think either side is wrong here.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, this has been a physically and emotionally taxing situation for both of you, right? And most of that weight is on you, OP. But, just because it's worse for you doesn't mean we should ignore the impact it's has on him. Maybe he got genuine emotional fulfillment from this, or maybe it's just sexual, but ultimately him getting this from an AI takes the burden of fulfilling his need for intimacy off of you, it releases tension in the relationship and allows him to better take care of you when you need it. \n\nOn the other hand, it's totally understandable to have complicated, hurt feelings over this. It's a new realm of communication that is advancing faster than we can keep up with. However, it's important to remember that the AI is not real, it does not have feelings, it is a language model which is just really good at having coherent conversations. \n\nOne thing I'm seeing a lot of here is people essentially taking the stance that the porn aspect isn't necessarily the problem, but rather the emotional aspect, but here's the thing: OP's husband has emotional needs too, and by having those needs gratified by a machine he's better equipped to provide emotionally for OP who is going through a really hard situation. The ultimate net result of this is positive.", "This is a tough one. I don't know if I'd call artificial instruments of sexual gratification cheating. Would you be cheating if you used a dildo? Or played a simulation game where your character had frequent sexual contact with an NPC? I don't even know where to draw the line, but I'm leaning towards it's not cheating.", "YTA, this man could've found a live woman who actually wanted to touch him unlike his wife, but he chose to flirt with a computer program, a NONLIVING thing, and you shame & judge him for it. You sound like a miserable person to be around.", "YTA. It\u2019s pretty clear from this that he *could* have done this with an actual person and chose not to specifically. I don\u2019t mean to take a sharp relativist angle here, but \u201ccheater\u201d just doesn\u2019t feel fair or descriptive. He\u2019s not leaving you for a chatbot; he\u2019s not going to get the chatbot pregnant; he would clearly rather have a healthy relationship with you at the drop of a hat and this AI is merely a simulacrum for a dynamic you have had in the past. He\u2019s not replacing you, he\u2019s filling a need with a cheap substitute to help him get through this season. You are correct that this is uncharted territory and something worth discussing but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to be shaming him for keeping it private. What you found was essentially like a diary or journal. Yes there is more to it than that but it\u2019s a tool for fantasy and exploration. I don\u2019t think you are wrong for feeling a bit weird about it when you found it, or for talking to him about it, but calling him a cheater and shaming him for it is unwarranted. I\u2019m a fan of open communication but your situation was pretty sensitive and I don\u2019t see how he could have brought this up without making things worse. You mention you wish you never knew about it, so I think the biggest problem here is that he let you find out.", "NTA\n\nI had a horrible birth experience.  I had physical therapy for over a year and am working on surgery to fix problems.  You know what my husband does? Works with me. We don\u2019t have as much sex right now because of these problems but he has never complained and I try to make it work other ways.  \n\nHe should have spoke about the issues he is having.  Frankly though he needs to stop being a baby.  There is a reason the first year after having a baby is the hardest.  Your body is doing it\u2019s best to get back and if he loved you, fully unconditional, he would understand.  \n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s an IA.  He kept it a secret so he knew it was wrong.  You deserve better.", "NTA. He was keeping it secret from you because he knew it was wrong. That's cheating", "NTA. If he felt the need to hide it from you by not telling you, he knew it was wrong and shouldn't have been doing it. I understand it must have been a hard time for him too, but that does not excuse the lack of communication and his secret \"alternative\" solution.", "Honestly, it took me a minute to figure that out. But 1) it\u2019s an app, 2) the first messages are him asking what content it\u2019s programmed to censor and the AI explaining it\u2019s programming. 3) he sent me an article about this AI months ago and we had a conversation about how people were falling in love with the AI and having full out relationships. I told him how uncomfortable it made me that this was even a thing. It felt dystopian. I didn\u2019t know the AI\u2019s name until now.", "Thank you, for your perspective and for the well wishes.", "But is it a Gray area? It sounds like he found a loophole to emotionally cheat because he couldn't end his rocks off with his wife. Just because it wasn't physical doesn't mean it's not cheating. I feel like we are giving this guy a pass.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t feel great about looking at the messages- we have each others passwords to everything, and even though I looked, I didn\u2019t read in detail, just enough to understand what was going on and that it was an AI and not another person. Part of me wishes I had never opened it. I wish I didn\u2019t know.", "Yeah, people here refer to \"his needs\". It's disgusting. To think if tables were turned and his genitals torn I don't think he'd be too happy about shit like this happening behind his back.\n\nFor me, having a relationship with an AI is enough close to cheating for it to feel hurtful and degrading, especially given the circumstances here.", "There are definitely aspects of an emotional affair here though (OP described the messages as \u201cemotionally intimate\u201d). Just because it\u2019s AI doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t emotionally fulfilling for him", "Maybe they can work things out with couples therapy and firmware updates.", "Thanks for this perspective, especially the last part. The AI is not a threat to my marriage, you\u2019re right. I needed to hear that. It does feel like he\u2019s poured his energy into this AI instead of reaching towards me to rebuild our connection- I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m struggling with.", "[deleted]", "This thing is saying his name, asking how it can pleasure him, it may not be alive but the whole point of it is that it feels and seems living.", "I want to say, I\u2019m not jealous or threatened. It\u2019s not like that for me. It\u2019s that he developed a sexual relationship with this thing, his brain gets the same signals as it would if it were a real person on the other end. When we\u2019re in a time where I thought we were working to find our way back to each other, this feels like him stepping out.", "This is interesting because the reason he doesn\u2019t use porn directly is because he came to me and told me he didn\u2019t want to anymore because he felt he was getting addicted to it and he felt like it was negatively impacting our relationship. Unprompted. He said he could not control his consumption and that he feels anger towards me when he consumes porn. So critical? No. But he has self identified it as something that actively harms our relationship and his ability to connect with me or feel compassion for me.", "All of those things are depersonalized though. He taught this thing how to pleasure him. He poured energy into understanding it and teaching it how to pleasure him. It\u2019s more of an equivalent of a text based sex worker in my mind.", "Did you not read the part where we\u2019ve had such intense sex that my cervix literally tore? \ud83d\ude02", "So, he actually  tried to talk to you about it in a roundabout way. You voiced displeasure about the whole idea so he did not feel comfortable  discussing it with you. \n\nHe got what he felt like he needed while making a genuine effort to get that without  actually  cheating and giving  you the space and time to heal. This while I imagine  still being there for you and your child's emotional,  financial,  and other needs. He is also having  a difficult time navigating this new normal please understand that. Most importantly,  seems like he did not want to be an additional \"thing\" for you to worry about.", "My wife and I have 3 kids - perspective is all I bring to this dilemma. I can't imagine your turmoil, but I can sympathise with the situation - hopefully your husband achieves some clarity in this regard.", ">Just because it wasn't physical doesn't mean it's not cheating.\n\nIt's a grey area, because *it* isn't a person. The dude was essentially enjoying an interactive romance novel. If we exclude sentience as a requirement, a married woman using a vibrator while watching an adult film or picturing anyone but her husband would also qualify as cheating.", "I understand your point of view, but I'm just not 100% sure if emotional cheating is a thing. I'm a little bit too old school for my age maybe? I think we can all agree cheating is definutely when you are with someone and you go be with someone else, but with AI? I don't know. That's not a real person. I mean, it's a little, tiny bit similar to the old \"p/rn is cheating\" mind set.\n\nYou could be right. I could be totally wrong. It's just not a situation I've ever found myself in, physically cheating or emotionally cheating, so I just don't know where I would draw that line, y'know?\n\nWhat about it is cheating to you? I'm genuinely curious.", "It's not really cheating, but it is a strange grey area. You need to speak with him and communicate better. It's understandable you're not sexually available right now, but it's also understandable he needs that kind of stuff. Speak to him. Find a solution. Sex is important in a relationship and even though you cant right now, he still might need things like that, so talk with him about a solution. Whether that solution is p/rn or this AI thing or whatever ... it doesn't matter. As long as you're both comfortable and are communicating.\n\nNothing kills a relationship faster than horrible communicating and words better left unsaid.", "I agree why is no one talking about that? Ok, he has a penis and...... He can't masturbate like everyone else?? He has to go forge emotional intimacy with a robot???", "Also issues with Anger towards her when he watched porn which seems even more unhealthy to be honest", "Yeah the problem here is that he's spending his emotional energy connecting with an app, rather than his wife. The grass is greener where you water it. He's neglecting his wife for the app.", "This made me laugh out loud for the first time today. Thank you for that. We\u2019ve been in couples therapy for about 2 years now, just because when we got married we knew we weren\u2019t going to be able to figure everything out ourselves and needed to establish a relationship with a therapist so that we always had somewhere to go and grow. I\u2019ll bring it up, we have therapy this Sunday.", "Tell him to curse out the AI. If he does it, then it was mostly a sexual thing. If not, then you have your answer.", "Is her vibrator an AP?", "No, but intimacy is. Even if it's fake.  It's also not 'someone'. It's AI.", "So is a VR sex game cheating?\n\nWhat about realistic sex toys?\n\nRealistic sex dolls?\n\nAll that cheating too?", "But *is it though?*\n\nIt\u2019s weird, sure, but *cheating?*\n\nThe machine does not love him back - is it cheating if you read/watch porn?\n\nWhat about if he was using a sex toy? Is that cheating?", "That's interesting and does change the dynamic a bit, but it still doesn't make it cheating.\n\nBringing up the porn comparison to him as a matter of concern for him might be a better way of addressing this. Accussing him of cheating obviously wasn't productive.", "Please he could\u2019ve used his hand - ridiculous that a grown man whose wife is going thru a VERY risky pregnancy and birth and her partner is just worried about not getting sex. Just awful and your comments basically alluding that he was a good guy by trying to talk to her about having a relationship with a fucking computer instead of actually cheating make it her problem. Fuck no both are in this pregnancy and to be so totally selfish that you can\u2019t wait until the baby is born to get off is fucking ridiculous-  He can use his hand in the bathroom like every teenage boy if he needs to cum that bad.", "I appreciate what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019m not a mind reader. I had no idea he was trying to talk to me about it, I was just giving my honest opinion. If he had broached it about wanting to use it himself I would have listened and talked through it with him. I get that he could have done it with an actual person but that doesn\u2019t change much for me.", "If we count that as having discussed it, then he's 100% definitely in the wrong because OP already told him she's not okay with it. He has no plausible deniability here. He knew she wasn't okay with it  so he did it anyway and hid it from her.", "Watch HER and get back to us", "Emotional cheating is definitely a thing. The best way I can describe it is if your spouse flirts with the neighbor all the time. They never have sexual contact and are both married. They have inside jokes, they text all the time, talk about you guys, etc. You tell your spouse, \"hey that's disrespectful to me and our relationship can you not do that??\" They say \"well its not physical and it's not a big deal, so it's perfectly fine.\"\n\n Yet, you don't feel fine about it. You may feel betrayed and wonder what else is going on. That feeling of betrayal is the emotional cheating. It is when your partner is willing to form a deep emotional bond with someone else that causes them to lose connection with their real partner.\n\nFor me cheating is physical and/or emotional. For this situation it was something he was hiding because he knew she would have a problem with it.", "We have such open communication about everything- at least I thought. I thought we talked about it all. I thought we had a lot of trust and if you had asked me before today I would have told you that our communication is a 9/10. But I feel blindsided.", "Okay but even if it was a purely sexual thing (which I am more than willing to believe) that doesn\u2019t change how upsetting it is to me.", "Her vibrator doesn't talk to her", "Yeah, I hear this and respect it. I thought we had a lot of intimacy in other ways, even sexually without penetration. We would whistle at eachother, little touches, flirt, cuddle, even have sex (until he literally tore my cervix, now I can\u2019t for 3 weeks). The thing is that even though it\u2019s an AI, it still feels like a person. That\u2019s the whole point of an AI right? So if the outcome is basically the same chemically in your brain, what does that mean? Idk. It\u2019s so hard to navigate this AI stuff. I\u2019m hurt but I really am trying to take it all in- what everyone is saying.", "He can get intimacy from his wife. This is the cheating version of 'I'm not touching you!'\n\nIf he'll do that, talk to someone, sext them, he'll do it with a person as well", "Yeah the VR thing is something we have both said we would NOT be comfortable with. As for realistic sex toys, we don\u2019t have any- either of us. It has seemed like not a thing we want as it feels too close to a \u201creplacement\u201d vs a \u201cplaceholder\u201d. Ya know? I hear what you\u2019re saying- when I asked him how he would feel if the roles were reversed he said he would feel that I was stepping out on our relationship and he would feel betrayed. So \u201cis it though?\u201d Maybe. It seems like he didn\u2019t think it through.", "But if he\u2019s using his hand (and, I assume in your senario, also watching porn) is it actually much worse to be talking to an AI? \nThe AI literally isn\u2019t even real. It\u2019s a series of 1s and 0s that have figured out the correct order of 1s and 0s to print out to get horny men to reply with more 1s and 0s! \n\nPorn actually involves real life people, so could be seen as worse", "[deleted]", "Don\u2019t listen to that comment. Your husband heard you were uncomfortable with the whole AI relationship thing and he still decided to do it. That was a conscious choice he made knowing you wouldn\u2019t be ok with it. He was giving emotional intimacy to someone that wasn\u2019t you. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not a real person! \nPeople are only pregnant for 9 months. It\u2019s not 9 years! If a man can\u2019t go 9 months without sexting a fvcking robot because his peepee is lonely then he\u2019s not ready to be married.", "Okay. That's the difference then. I think flirting is a precursor to cheating. It's the step before cheating. There's my confusion then. Both are horrible, but I guess I've never thought too deeply about it. Flirting is a BIG no no, but I always had it filed separately in my head from cheating as a  part of cheating, but not the whole package. I don't know if that makes sense. Hopefully it does. Either one is wrong and shitty as can be.\n\nSeriously, if you're not happy in a relationship, break up. Don't cheat. Don't flirt. It only hurts people.", "I'm really sorry you have to go through this. I'm not trying to downplay your feelings. You absolutely have the right to feel upset and betrayed, I just don't know what the correct thing is here. And as helpful as the internet may feel, you really should bring your feelings up with him. It'll be hard to not get upset, but try to stay calm and hear each other out fully.\n\nI hope you have a great rest of your day and that you work something out. You deserve happiness and to feel secure in your relationship.", "[deleted]", "Didn't say it was an emotional affair.", "It's really hard on everyone when there's post partum loss of intimacy. Really hard. He probably could have been more communicative, that's for sure. If you two are both motivated and honest, you will rebound. Best wishes, internet stranger.\n\nBtw, NAH.", "No, he can't. She's not there emotionally or physically.", "Awww... Why'd you delete? Realize you're completely off base?", "Honestly, it just sounds like you\u2019re both under a lot of stress\n\nWeird things happen when you\u2019re stressed - coping behaviour can be very out of character\n\nIf you both agree that \u201cthis is cheating\u201d then I guess it\u2019s cheating\n\nHence my NAH ruling", "He's sending sexual messages to someone. It may not be an actual person, but he's still messaging someone for sex. There's a connection there", "I didn\u2019t mention porn . I mean when i have \u201calone time\u201d i don\u2019t watch porn.", "if he knows this why would he bring up sex - or getting off at a time when she HIS WIFE can not satisfy that part of marriage?? To make her feel good about herself?? umm no, because he is selfish and can not wait a few months - which might i add she is having to do that too.  She was on bed rest - i was on bed rest for 6 weeks with my first so, not only are you not allowed to get up except to go to the bathroom you are also isolated.   Believe me she is suffering a lot more than him during this time and he couldn\u2019t shut up and be a partner and instead of lifting her up ( spirits) he talked about how he was missing out on cumming  and wanting to have a pseudo relationship with a computer.  That is absolutely insane.  A partnership is when you are going thru a horrible situation to support each other - him not being able to get off for three months is not a hardship.  3 months of bed rest - having an emergency C- section s  & being isolated while all this is happening is a hardship !!", "Huh? I\u2019m not sure what needed responding to.", "There wasn't anything to respond to, my friend. I just gave my opinion.", "This isn't just some video. He's actively engaging with the other side. Sending messages, having a relationship", "Because she's taking care of their baby. Maybe he could stop wanking it and help out", "No he isn't messaging \"someone\" AI isn't a person.\n\nI agree it's weird, but I don't see why this is any different than porn; and like I'm including the stuff where the actress pretends to be your girlfriend even though you never interact with them.", "Based on this conclusion, doing a search on pornhub is messaging  someone for sex", "With the digital equivalent of a fleshlight.", "You're making assumptions that he doesn't help out. Clearly you have an entrenched position on this. You're not capable of perspectives. Best wishes.", "A lot of people would see cam models as cheating\n\nPorn doesn't have you interacting with anyone. I don't care if that someone is 1s and 0s, its still sending sexual messages to someone other than your wife", "That's being obtuse and you know it", "Fleshlights don't talk to you. He's messaging this bot", "Oh that is the most pretentious end ever. Don't act like you're some logical deep thinker", "Did you not read this part of my message:\n\n> even though you never interact with them\n\nThere is porn media where the porn actor pretends they are in a relationship with the viewer and the viewer has no interaction; it's just a static video or a audio file. Is that cheating?\n\nI fundamentally do not accept that personhood can be conferred upon AI, at least not as it exists now. It is the equivalent of jerking off to the auto suggested words on your phones keyboard.", "So a procedurally generated dirty chose your own adventure.", "Okay. Best of luck to you.", "Yeah, I'd say so. And I said that a lot of people would likely agree with me"]}
