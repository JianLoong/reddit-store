I found out last night when looking through my photos and and discovered photos of them NAKED in my bed with my sheets and everything. I was disturbed and felt violated. L was using my old phone (without permission) and it was still on my account which is why the pictures ended up in my library. \n\nThere were times I came home and my room looked slightly different, but I ignored it. I texted the ex and she confirmed that they had. the only reason was that my room was always clean, L is very messy.\n\nMy room was my safe space after some traumatic events in my life.\n\nAlso I used to share my room with my little sister who passed away in March. Which is making the whole situation worse.\n\nI have never even slept in my bed with my ex\u2019s. Someone is always home and I wouldn\u2019t try and make anyone in the house uncomfortable. also my little sister was still alive I didn\u2019t want to disrespect her in case she got better. \n\nWhen I found out last night I couldn\u2019t stop crying & throwing up from crying so hard.

So I said then she can get me the cheapest bed frame until I can save up for one, even though I\u2019d prefer to have my original frame.\n\nL doesn\u2019t work, is on disability and gets around 800 a month, her money is all spending money. My mom thinks I should get the cheapest mattress ($60 a month for 12) put it on the floor until I can by myself a new bed frame, and just \u201cwash the sheets\u201d. \n\nThe mattress I want will be about $80 a month for 12 (even though mine is nicer), I\u2019d get the cheapest frame about $150 and \u201cbed in a bag\u201d. I\u2019d save up to get a nicer frame/sheets.\n\nMy mom is saying it\u2019s not fair \u201cbecause she\u2019s different\u201d she also wants to pay for half so L\u2019s spending money isn\u2019t affected. I have ADHD, I know it\u2019s not the same thing as autism but still, it\u2019s not fair she gets special treatment. \n\nL said \u201csorry but it\u2019s not fair because I\u2019m autistic I don\u2019t know any better\u201d which is bs because if I did the same thing to her she would take a fit and I\u2019d be expected to replace everything. my mom has enabled her for basically her whole life, my moms parents agree.

Because it seems like there is a lot of trauma there that is the major underlying issue here, and it's important to make sure that you are working through that with someone who can help you. \n\nI will say that from a regular standpoint, making your sister replace your bedframe and mattress because she was intimate in them is a way overreaction. I would say that making her replace the sheets would be all that would expected.  But again, I know there are other issues at play here, which is why I don't want to deem you AH for anything. I just think it's important to make sure the underlying issues get addressed.", "YWNBTA - from reading the comments and your replies, your sister L knew about the boundaries you had set on your room, and she had acknowledged them in a therapy session, and then promptly violated those boundaries in a very selfish way, and then said \"I'm autistic, I don't know any better.\"  She may be autistic, but she clearly did know better.  If she understands enough of complex human emotions to have a love affair, she understands enough to get the concept of boundaries and personal property.  And, she tried to hide the behavior - she knew what she was doing would make you unhappy.  But I would bet that \"I'm autistic.\" has been her magic phrase to let her do anything she wants.\n\n  If replacing the entire bed is what you need to feel whole and safe again, then that's what you should make her do, thought it may take her a while to pay it off.  L has been doing whatever she wants without consequences for her whole life, it sounds like, and she needs to understand that, you, at least, are going to hold her accountable for her behavior when it is appropriate to do so.  I understand that your whole family is grieving here, but that doesn't give L the right to deliberately violate your boundaries, and it doesn't give your mother the right to just expect you to put up with it.", "NTA She had no right to use your bed just because her room is messy.

L sounds like an awful person who is cunning enough to exploit her autism to manipulate others, and she's really done a number on your mom.  I don't blame you for feeling violated; someone else having sex in your bed is skeevy enough, but to add that your bed means more to you as a safe space, than another person's bed means to them, makes it even worse.

A little overboard, maybe, but she had repeatedly done it, after being told it's a major trigger for your trauma. She has an understanding of not using shit that isn't her's, so it's absolute bullshit \"she didn't know.\" I also can kind of relate as well, as I had a roommate with several mental disorders. It was severely violating of my privacy and safety when I realized that in my sleep, she had sex with some random tinder guy mere *FEET* away from me. It was a dorm, and the space between our beds was roughly 5 feet. What would she have done if I'd woken up? What would I have done? But irregardless, your sister violated your privacy and knew she could \"get away\" with it using her autism and your mother.

Perhaps see about getting a lock for your door with a code/key she doesn't have access to to have your safe space. Considering she can't keep the verbal agreement or leave your things alone.", "NTA. A mental illness doesn't give you entitlement. I have 4 mental health disorders and I would never want special treatment. I would rather be treated normal like everyone else.

Get new sheets sure but she really doesnt need to replace the fcking bedframe", "You need serious help if someone touching your bed requires a new one? I didn't see anything about it being broken. No she shouldn't have gone in your room and had sex in your bed. But demanding a new frame, mattress and bedding is overkill. You can wash the sheets or replace them if you really need to but the rest is way over the top.", "ESH- \n\nFirstly, your sister should not have slept in your bed without permission. She definitely should have changed the sheets after she had. It\u2019s a bit gross and I get the frustration. This is not ok and she should take responsibility for her actions (in terms of understanding why she is in the wrong, apologising and accepting that you will be angry/ your relationship has taken a hit). \n\nSoft YTA for expecting a new bed. That is an unrealistic expectation and at first glance, (without your additional information about past trauma), comes across pretty immature. If it was a case of you just being like \u201cewww someone was on my bed naked, throw the whole thing away it\u2019s gross\u201d I would think you had some growing up to do. \n\nHowever, from your additional information I can see that the space means more to you than it would most, and your reaction is also a response to past trauma and your bed being a safe space. I\u2019m sorry that feels infringed upon. \n\nThe reason for a ESH is that fundamentally,  there\u2019s nothing wrong with the bed itself (or even the sheets after a wash, but if it really bothers you then new sheets are an option), or mattress just because your sister and partner slept in the bed naked. The sheets mean that the mattress itself wasn\u2019t actually touched by their bodies. I get that this is bigger than a bed for you, but it is unreasonable to expect your sister to buy you a new mattress over this. \n\nShe does need to take responsibility for her actions, but her repercussions need to be in proportion to wrongdoing. Apologising, washing the sheets, not being allowed in your room, accepting your lack of trust etc is reasonable, expecting her to buy a new mattress is not. \n\nI\u2019m glad you are getting therapy and I hope it helps. I wonder- do you think it might be a good idea to take your sister to a session? Just so she can really understand why she has crossed a boundary here and the extent of the harm it has caused you? \n\nWishing you all the best OP. Xx", "Totally NTA. And I\u2019m saying this as someone who\u2019s autistic. I would feel so gross and violated of I\u2019d discovered other people were using my bed for that because my room is also my safe space. \n\nI\u2019m autistic and I know better. If she wanted to sleep with her girlfriend she should have cleaned her own room or have just worked around the mess.\n\nEdited to add: Idk if it\u2019s too unreasonable or not to have her replace the whole bed but I can completely understand the immediate reaction.", "YWBTA if you asked to replace everything.\n\nSheets can easily be replaced, or simply washed.  Hotels wash sheets, they do not replace them between customers.\n\nWe have a mattress cover on top of our foam topper.  That gets washed occasionally, not as much as we do the sheets, but it still gets done several times a year.  This helps to keep the foam topper from getting dirtier than it does.", "Y T SUPER DUPER A. Are you serious. This has got to be some type of dare. \nWash the sheets and go to bed. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. Make her pay for new bedding but paying for a whole mattress is nonsensical.

Sounds like you're also autistic. Trauma is not a strong enough reason for you to feel like your entire bed set needs to be replaced just because someone else slept in it. Literally everything can be washed. You feeling unsafe is something you need to work on with your therapist because your demands are extremely unreasonable. Just have her wash/clean everything.", "ESH. I understand your feelings on this but if going in your room and touching your things is that much of a trigger than you need to keep the room locked. Hoping for people to respect your boundaries is well intentioned but not always the outcome. Expecting to replace the entire bed is an overreaction, as just getting new sheets would suffice. \n\nAlso, your sisters autism doesn\u2019t seem relevant at all in this scenario. She knew what she was doing and disrespected your space to be intimate with her partner. Using her disability as an excuse is just enabling her, so she\u2019ll never take responsibility for her actions.", "ESH it's rude (and weird) to have sex in another person's bed, especially when you live in the house and have your own bed. You don't need a new bed. Just wash the sheets - which is something you should have been doing anyway.\n\nYou should also install a masterlock on the door so that it locks on the outside and only you can unlock it.

Giving her two-three months maybe to get all three and letting her know the specific sheet set you want her to buy as a replacement (if you're ok spreading the purchases over three months, you could even make sure you're getting nice high end and quality ones that will be different and comfortable to help you feel good in your space again). \n\nThe lock I think may be an especially good option - it's clear that there are some patterns of boundary stomping by her towards your and she disregarded an explicit promise she agreed to. And is now disregarding that she upset you. Having her but a keyed lock (that only you have the key for) would hopefully also help you feel more secure that it is your space and refuge and that other people cannot intrude into it even when you're not there.

Your situation isn\u2019t simply \u201cmy sister slept in my bed without my permission\u201d. It\u2019s nuanced and you have done your part to try to communicate your needs, which were clearly ignored. And that\u2019s never okay.

You may end up separating the crossing of your boundaries and the mattress/bed frame. \nIt sounds to me like the real issue is the bed now serves as a reminder that your boundaries were violated, and given that we don\u2019t know your past trauma, that could be an absolutely massive, borderline unforgivable act of disrespect.

I\u2019m sorry for sounding rude earlier I\u2019m just used to people using it as a negative thing which it is not. Which is what my mind jumped to and I\u2019m sorry for doing that.

I saw it and literally tackled him even though he had like 10 inches and probably 100 pounds on me. I did a running start and he fell and I just went off on him. I got thrown off of him and then teachers showed up to break the fight up. I got hurt but he looked worse. He got expelled and I was supposed to get suspended (my first time getting in trouble it wasn\u2019t for him) but my parents took it to the school board and I didn\u2019t get in trouble at all because my school was really known for protecting kids with disabilities/learning difficulties. \n\nI see where you\u2019re coming from and I\u2019m sorry that I jumped to a conclusion that you were being malicious.

It'll underscore the importance of respecting your space and boundaries and how her actions violated that - requiring the added lock. Diffuser is a great idea for yourself to feel better :). I love playing around and mixing oils to match my mood and it really makes a space feel nice having that little added ability to change the vibe and feel. \n\nYou should also be proud of how you handled things here. Your initial over the top response makes more sense in context. But you yourself saw that you were reacting to all the underlying emotional dynamics (rightfully so!) and how that's the crux of the issue. You recognized that and then turned to coming up with legitimate solutions that were reasonable and fair while also addressing your own most pressing needs / concerns.

Maybe with your therapist for mediation, you can communicate how you are feeling in a way that brings some resolution and allows that bed, with new sheets, to become a safe space for you again. If you still feel like you need a new bed and frame to feel comfortable, then that need should be met.
