It's possible that he may not have said anything till a few days before, or if it's on a calendar he can see, your explanation of why you were working Christmas is because there were no plans for catching up with anyone that you knew about (as there was no communication).

It's still November and only 2 days since conversation. He had no way of knowing that he needed to discuss this with you before 26th November or you would make other plans. I think your decision to just sign up for work without talking to him was passive aggressive.\n\nThat being said. I get it. We can only take so much of feeling disregarded. It's one of the hardest feelings to get past. And your husband knows you have an issue with feeling excluded and you feel this should make him extra sensitive to ensuring you don't feel that way. And he just didn't think of that, and it feels like once again he just didn't think of you.\n\nI do, however, wonder why you hosted and cooked Thanksgiving when he was the one who issued the invites and didn't tell you that he had, or ask you if you were ok with it. I would be more annoyed about that, frankly. And I probably would have told him to cook. Actions = consequences. You invite without asking me, you're doing the work.\n\nSo I think keeping going to therapy is definitely a good idea.

Same with what he did to thanksgiving. He invites his family and doesn't tell you but expects you to cook! And this when you work. Why do you let yourself treat like this? He behaves as if your time has no worth. He makes plans for you.

Did you really think the right choice was to wait only ONE day for him to randomly bring it up to you to go ahead and schedule yourself for work on Christmas, a month away? Just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n \nEdit2: wow I just saw your post history and Jesus you need to leave this guy. Cheating on you with an ex, letting his friends talk trash about you, giving you a fucking man-shaped pillow to avoid intimacy lmao wtf? Was the SA from him too? Like seriously, get the fuck out.", "ESH. \n\nHe's TA about the Thanksgiving meal. \n\nYou're TA about Christmas. \n\nJust pure dysfunction and contempt for each other with zero desire to function as a couple. \n\nJust end it at this point.

Instead of saying to your hubby \u2018hey - I heard we,re invited for Christmas?  you choose to test you\u2019re husband to see if you are invited and add meaning that you are being left out.  Yes- he could do better verbalizing too- but you are turning a completely innocuous situation into unnecessary drama.", "You wrote that you heard your husband\u2019s parents invite \u201cus\u201d over for Christmas with them.  You also heard your husband accept that invitation.\n\nHowever, for some reason you chose to pretend you didn\u2019t know you were invited, even though you knew you were.  \n\nNot only did you know you were invited when you heard the invitation being issued, but it is also a social convention that when one spouse is invited, both are invited.\n\nSo while you knew you were invited and heard your husband accept, you decided you needed a special invite from your husband.  When you didn\u2019t get one within 24 hours, the next day you decided to sabotage your husband\u2019s plans to attend Christmas with you at his parent\u2019s home by volunteering to work.  \n\nFrankly, it is YOU who are acting as if you are not part of the family.  Was there something wrong with you having a conversation with your husband about Christmas plans before you decided to work that day?  Of course not.

All of the above for now while he gets used to the new rules?)\n\nLiterally write this list out & agree it with him - leave it on the fridge - then next time it happens, you can make the conversation more around: \u201coh, did the list not work? Which part of it didn\u2019t make sense for you - shall we tweak the steps we agreed?\u201d\n\nAlso - why did you cook the Thanksgiving meal, when you were given such short notice? \n\nIt will help you both if you are more clear in your actions & responses.

That's all he needs to say to explain your absence.  As for what happened at Thanksgiving,  you should have wished him well making dinner and reminded him you were working. Tell him he needs to consult with you before you can be committed to an activity. Until you are consulted,  you are not going to go. And if you make another commitment because he did not consult you, then too bad. You and he are not one person. He does not speak for you. Time to call your marriage counselor. You two need more practice communicating.", "NTA. But it sounds like you should divorce this guy because he is disrespectful and inconsiderate of you as his wife.", "ESH. You two really need to work on communicating. You should have asked him as soon as you overheard the invite, and he should have told you as soon as he got the invite.  Communication can be hard, but it is critical.", "NTA\n\nHe sprung a Thanksgiving dinner on you and planned to spring a Christmas gathering too? Are you sure counseling is working because I would be livid.", "NTA \n\nAnd tbh, for thanksgiving I would have just not cooked. I would have told him to order from somewhere if he thought he had a right to plan for us to host and not allow me proper time to prepare. This year was the first time I did the majority of cooking for thanksgiving on my own and I started preparing three days prior. But you did it all alone with only a day and a half of notice?

He doesn't get to decide for both of them on his own.", "Frankly I'm on the opposite end, I feel like this is EXACTLY reddits paygrade. \n\nWe are a bit of a petty lot and he already had one blowup over not communicating what he wanted to do for thanksgiving and his parents weren't even out the drive before he did it all over again.\n\nThis feels very much a very levelheaded yet petty response that MIGHT get him to realize that he needs to treat her like a separate human being and ask.", "Have you asked him how, specifically, you want to be included? What, specifically, you want him to say and do? Specifics are very very helpful for autism. Perhaps even practicing a conversation where you pretend to be one of his family members. \n\nThanksgiving aside, it does seem like he truly thought you *were* included automatically in Christmas (which I think is a common assumption that the whole family would be invited, not just one spouse). And it\u2019s also a fair assumption for him to make that you\u2019d be available on Christmas, since you worked on Thanksgiving and alternate holidays. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the wrong for that part. You *both* need to talk about your holiday plans much farther in advance. My family talks about holiday plans like 6 months in advance\u2026 it\u2019s also so underhanded to overhear an important conversation and then just let it fester instead of bringing it up right away. \n\nESH", "I think he doesn\u2019t care. My husband has adhd and according to him probably on the spectrum but hasn\u2019t been officially diagnosed. This man left me alone for Christmas when we first got married. I got married super young and he was pretty young as well. So we were both idiotic. \n\nWe did a ton of marriage counseling and he did individual therapy and now he knows better. He still makes stupid mistakes like he\u2019ll forget to tell me his parents invited us to a function sometimes but he has been trying to make me feel included and trying to be on top of stuff for the past couple years. I\u2019m gonna assume y\u2019all are much older than us and so there\u2019s absolutely no excuse at this point imo besides the fact that he doesn\u2019t care,", "I got curious. In another recent comment, she says they are 16 & 18, and until very recently (assuming up until she got married) she was a single mom. That tidbit just added another layer to my curiosity.", "The caveat to what I said is if her husband is autistic. OP said he was, though it\u2019s unclear if it is a formal diagnosis. However, if he is and depending on where he is on the spectrum, it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019s doing this maliciously to exclude her and probably isn\u2019t making the connection between \u201cyou\u2019ve agreed to this event without asking me\u201d and \u201cI feel excluded\u201d or picking up on the passive aggressive reactions. \n\nThe reality is, there are challenges with being with someone on the spectrum, and sometimes it requires the other person to have more honest conversations about certain behaviors or to be a little more understanding/patient. This is not to say she\u2019s wrong for being frustrated or upset, and I\u2019m not saying she has to plan every gathering or keep tabs on him, but letting his mom know to check in with her too or simply reminding him, in these moments, that he needs to check with her before committing - would be much more productive than lashing out after the fact and resenting him.", "OP has intentionally sabotaged her husband\u2019s plans to attend Christmas dinner with his parents.

Your mistake, though, was telling him you signed up to work and that you heard the conversation.

They were there for several hours, based on the fact that you were only an hour into cooking when they arrived, and no one mentioned Christmas at their house until they were out the door and alone with your husband?

Your husband is on parole? Your kids are only 16 and 18 and don't live with you at all? There is so much going on here and none of it is healthy. Your marriage is going nowhere.

I wouldn't go bragging that marriage counseling has done its job quite yet.\n\nYes, he sucks about the Thanksgiving thing, but since you're asking about Christmas plans, it's E S H.  You're both sh\\*tty communicators and instead of just outright asking him about what you heard you decided to be petty and passive aggressive and play emotional chicken with him and you both lost.  Instead of Christmas presents this year, use the money to up your counseling sessions.", "NTA", "ESH. You kind of set him up to fail by not mentioning it in the moment.

You did it *specifically* to anger him, because you assumed your MIL wouldn't want you there at Christmas and that he'd go without you. It's not about working or not, but your motivation.

We have a standing rule with his family that if not discussed with me, then it is not likely to happen. Not been nasty but if it needs arranging, I need warning.

In particular, she says about her husband \u201c One thing he has always done that really hurts my feelings is he acts like I\u2019m not part of his family, and rarely includes me in his thoughts and plans regarding them.\u201d\n\nHowever, the facts show she is a major part of the problem.  She knew was invited to Christmas dinner at her in-laws and that her autistic husband accepted.  But she decided to work Christmas instead.  \n\nThe issue here is her complaining about not being included when she is.  She can work, stay home, or sit in a bar room on Christmas instead of going to her in-laws.  It\u2019s her life and her decision.  But her complaints about her husband not acting as though she is part of the family and not including her are borderline delusional."]}
