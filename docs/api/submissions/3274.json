Is his penis allergic to the kitchen?", "NTA. Don't let him turn it to you, he never told you about the invitation. Apologise to your IL for not going and tell them you didn't know you were invited as he never mentioned it to you. Let him look bad, it's his own doing", "Why are you with this man? He clearly doesn't respect you as his wife. Just cut and run lady. I mean seriously.", "That sounds like a lot of hurt feelings which were kindda surpressed. \n\nMaybe a deeper conversation is needed about what yoou expect what you want and how to move forward because right now it feels like there is a leak of communication I mean he doesn't tell you that he invited his parents for thanksgiving and that you got invivted for christmas like why are they mad at you let them know that the son never mentioned an invitation . It shouldn't be that hard to say hey honey we got invited to my parents house for christmas so why didn't he just mentioned it?", "INFO\n\nIs your husband legitimately autistic, as in diagnosed by a professional? There is some leeway based on how it presents with him that could could move the needle here between E.S\nH. and N.A.H.\n\nIf he's been honestly working to improve identified problematic behaviors/actions from counseling, then this is a case of it being a work-in-progress issue compounded by the lack of communication you both have, neither of you are AH.\n\nIf he's self-diagnosed (oh, haha, I'm so socially awkward and act like an AH, I must be autistic) or doesn't put in any effort to improve the identified problems, then he's clearly the AH here and you are not. \n\nIf communication is a known issue for both of you, or if passive aggressive behavior is something identified as a problem on your end in counseling, this is a case of you both being AH.\n\nAll that said above, traditionally once married the couple is treated as a package deal, so an invitation extended to one half of a married couple to a family event is an invitation to both. This isn't automatically a misogynistic practice or any of that \"the wife is just an extension of the husband\" crap, it's a recognition that the two chose to bind themselves together as a family unit. Just like if and when children come into the picture, an invitation to Thanksgiving, Christmas, or a summer barbecue, includes the children as well.", "This is not a post about A I T A.

Your husband sounds exhausting. The fact that he doesn\u2019t communicate plans with you, especially when he expects you to cook or buy gifts or show up to something, is both rude and weird. The fact that you would decide to work on a big holiday without discussing it first is also weird. Has communication come up in your marriage counseling? It not, it\u2019s time for you to bring it up. The two of you will absolutely not last if you can\u2019t tell each other simple things like what you\u2019re doing for Christmas.", "ESH. If you both refuse to communicate, I\u2019m not sure how you even ended up married. Or can stay married much longer. You heard the invitation, so signing up for Christmas was not a cool move. Yes, of course he should have asked you about Thanksgiving and Christmas before agreeing to them. And yes, a Christmas invitation to him would logically include you.", "ESH. Communication is the key in every relationship, you guys need to talk and encourage one another to have a normal conversation about your priorities and plan.

If your relationship sucks that bad, an *adult* friend would support you getting out of it or working through it.  The immaturity from all of you is exhausting.", "Your friends are right. Your husband needs to realise that the way he's going about things is selfish and unkind. Whether or not you overheard the conversation with his parents, or whether invitations implicitly include both of you is not really relevant - he never actually said to you that you were invited, or asked whether you wanted to spend Christmas with his parents. So as far as you were concerned, there was no invitation.\n\nI mean, I'm glad to hear your marriage counselling has made things better, but if this is what 'better' looks like, is this something you really want for the rest of your life?\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA but serious question, I know you\u2019ve done counselling, but why are you with this chap? Obviously the counselling hasn\u2019t done much because you said this was one of the biggest issues and it clearly hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nHave a look at Daniel Sloss: Jigsaw on Netflix\u2026 \nBest of luck \ud83d\ude15", "NTA they\u2019re his family.

If he's acting as if you are a maid/accessory to his plans that can jump to attention for his whims, with no conversation, consideration or notice, and letting his family's feelings/plans come before you? *That counselling is not working the way you think it is*.\n\nYou're supposed to be partners. Not only does he not factor you in when making plans, *he actively leaves you out until he realises it affects him*. \n\nWork your Christmas shift and when you talk to his family let them know that you're sorry that you're going to miss the holiday but you didn't know you were supposed to have plans. He didn't let you know about Thanksgiving until 2 days before and surely he learned from you killing yourself to make it work not to leave you out of plans?", "NTA. Maybe this way he will learn.", "NTA\n\nI'd just tell the in-laws that hubby has been assuming that you can read his mind and you didn't even know about Thanksgiving until practically the day of.  Put the awkward back on him, where it belongs.\n\nAsk them to, in the future, just please always include you directly into conversations about family gatherings, because you do have your own family/life and might have co-ordinate things, etc. \n\nTell hubby that he absolutely needs to be more thoughtful of you when accepting invitations, especially for big holidays and to write that shit down on a mutual calendar, at least.  Autism doesn't stop him from being able to share information.", "I was going to say NTA till you said that he was autistic.\n\nHe views the world very differently to you and may not actually have the capacity to think ahead and communicate without some work on this.  He may have an idea in his mind but fails to let others know so that it can be organised.\n\nNo wonder you have had issues.  He's probably not being deliberately hurtful.  He may just not realise how his lack of communication is impacting others.\n\nSo NAH.\n\nIn this case it may have been better not to have said anything about signing up to work for Christmas unless he asked.  It's possible that he may not have said anything till a few days before, or if it's on a calendar he can see, your explanation of why you were working Christmas is because there were no plans for catching up with anyone that you knew about (as there was no communication).  Not sure it would sink through but it might somewhat and may mean that there's less animosity between you.", "INFO- why didn't the parents invite both of you when you were all together? You're in healthcare so you might have had to work anyway. This would have given you the opportunity to say, sorry, I have to work that day or Thanks, I'm free.", "I think NAH. I was going to say N T A but your husband is autistic and it doesn't sound like he is deliberately excluding you, just struggling to understand the right way to include you.\n\nHe was asked a direct question about wanting to go for Christmas and he answered yes he would want to. It's still November and only 2 days since conversation. He had no way of knowing that he needed to discuss this with you before 26th November or you would make other plans. I think your decision to just sign up for work without talking to him was passive aggressive.\n\nThat being said. I get it. We can only take so much of feeling disregarded. It's one of the hardest feelings to get past. And your husband knows you have an issue with feeling excluded and you feel this should make him extra sensitive to ensuring you don't feel that way. And he just didn't think of that, and it feels like once again he just didn't think of you.\n\nI do, however, wonder why you hosted and cooked Thanksgiving when he was the one who issued the invites and didn't tell you that he had, or ask you if you were ok with it. I would be more annoyed about that, frankly. And I probably would have told him to cook. Actions = consequences. You invite without asking me, you're doing the work.\n\nSo I think keeping going to therapy is definitely a good idea. And discuss these situations specifically, it will give him a frame of reference.", "NTA I think your friends are right. At least they seem to know what's up.", "NTA And because you are an extansion of him, you also share the thoughts and he doesn't need to tell you about invites? How should he know that you are invited if he doesn't tell you? If you didn't heard it through the window, when did he plan to tell you?! His behaviour is just disrespectful. Same with what he did to thanksgiving. He invites his family and doesn't tell you but expects you to cook! And this when you work. Why do you let yourself treat like this? He behaves as if your time has no worth. He makes plans for you. And then he just tell you what he decided you do with your time?! \n\nYou wrote that you had lots of problems, but it seems that you still have many. Starting with the disrespect for you and your time.", "I think this is above reddit's pay grade. Both of these individuals are doing a poor job at communicating. This is a marriage. If there is a concern, address it. The way OP and the husband are going about things just sounds like they are headed for divorce. \n\nAlso, unrelated, but I was curious about the kids. I will admit that I'm just being nosey here, and they very well may be fully grown adults, but OP didn't seem to even consider them in this Christmas Day work equation.", "Thank you!!!

It is the best and easiest part of my life. Everything else is work, my marriage is my refuge.", "There is a difference between purposely not including you and not recognizing you have separate schedules. From what you said, it sounds like his parents invited both of you to Christmas, and were happy to spend Thanksgiving with you as well, so it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is purposely excluding you from the family. If your husband is autistic and struggles with making plans that take into account both of your schedules, I\u2019m not sure why you wouldn\u2019t just want to take on a more pro-active role in planning or even just talk with his mom about keeping you in the loop. \n\nRegardless, the fact that you overheard the conversation and opted to lash out, rather than communicate then and there that it sounded like he was excluding you / wasn\u2019t considerate of your time, should maybe be a sign that this is not an incredibly healthy relationship for either of you to be in.", "He isn't going to change. He may not be *capable* of change. If you aren't willing to be the one to always dig for info, even that means asking daily what plans have come up, you may not be compatible.

I wonder why almost everyone on reddit is autistic and I feel like in many cases autism is a self-diagnosed excuse for being selfish or an AH and not wanting to change....", "when you know he is an autist why don't you talk to the mother . One main issue of autist are they have a hard time to include themselves . So you expect from someone who struggle to socialize to socialize you ? \n\nWhat exactly is he doing ? Not telling you that he is going to his parents ? I mean when they are upset that you won't come it doesn't sounds like there is bad blood . Do you also have autism and trouble to connect to his parents ?", "This isn't a social cue issue. This is a *not telling you about plans in a timely manner* and *agreeing to things without consulting you* issue.\n\nYou working Christmas also isn't something that anyone should be upset about. Health care is a 24/7/365 job. It's not an office job where you can just lock up at 5pm on Dec 24 and return at 9am on Dec 26th. Short staffing is always an issue at Christmas, which is why I'll be working Christmas as well.\n\nWhen I told my mom I wouldnt be there for Christmas because of work, she said \"I just assumed you'd pick up the OT\". My boyfriend said the same thing.", "This is very important information. You need to work WITH him to build habits. He\u2019ll most likely never understand the logic, but is probably capable of learning what he needs to do even if he doesn\u2019t get the why. It\u2019s not like a switch is going to turn on and he suddenly gets it. \n\nHe\u2019s not acting like this to be an AH to you when you heard the conversation you could have used that as a learning point. \n\nI know this has to be frustrating to live with. The thing is you chose to marry him knowing he is non-neurotypical. You can help him grow and learn to provide what you need from him even if he doesn\u2019t understand it. \n\nHis literally functions differently than yours.  Trying to teach him a lesson in this way is borderline bullying him. \n\nMy heart goes out to you both, this has to be difficult adjustment. \n\nIn this instance I\u2019m going to have to say YTA", "There does seem to be an epidemic of autism, twin pregnancies, and tragic early demise of spouses here on /r/aita."]}
