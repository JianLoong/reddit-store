This dude needs to clean up after himself, and also from the sounds of it just be a more functional human being, but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nCan you just start using your moms shower?

You're used to having your own bathroom, but most kids your age have never had that, so don't act like it's a right. Instead, explain to your mother that, as shared space, it needs to be treated respectfully by all who use it. Not respecting the space is the same as not respecting the other people who use it. And don't enter into the conversation with demands (ie I want him to stop using my bathroom!) in mind - instead, enter into it with your problems ready to explain, and hopefully your mom will listen and be willing to help the three of you come up with a compromise so that everyone is happy in the end", "YWNBTA.

If your mom complains about you using her space, ask her why YOU should have to share intimate space with him when SHE, the person who chooses him, doesn't?\n\nedit for judgement - nta", "NTA...  I'd talk to your mom about it first. Try to do it by asking for her advice on how to deal with this problem, if you make it sound more like complaining then you might not get a sympathetic hearing. I'm afraid at 15 it leaves you with very little to bargain with. Good luck, you have my sympathy!", "NTA but it's highly likely that the reason he doesn't use the other bathroom is because your mother kicked him out.  \n\nI think you can, and should, talk to your mother but don't be surprised if nothing changes.", "NTA he's basically using you as a cleaning service. \n\nINFO: can you start using the shower in your mom's room? \n\n(also your mom is an AH for bringing a slob like this into the home and not making sure that you as a nearly grown teenager, have some of your own space in the house)", "NTA Take photos talk to your mom ask either he stops using it, cleans up after himself ir you move into hers as it's nasty", "Start using your moms.", "I agree. My gross step parent sense is tingling.", "The reason why is because she probably got mad at him for the same things you\u2019re mad about. \n\nThe difference is your mom getting upset could inconvenience his life whereas he can tell you to get over it. \n\nYou need to talk to your mom and show her the bathroom. It\u2019s not fair to ask a teenage girl to share a bathroom with her stepfather and clean up after him. \n\nIn your shoes, if nothing changed I would start shaming them hard about it. When you have family gatherings bring up how you have to share a bathroom with your stepdad. *\u201dMy mom\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t like using the master bathroom so I have to share my bathroom. I wish I could have more privacy.\u201d* Start bringing it up in front of your grandparents, aunts, uncles, stepdad\u2019s family and any other adults in your life. Don\u2019t mention how messy he is, just emphasize how your mom\u2019s husband insists on sharing a bathroom with his stepdaughter instead of his wife. It will be more effective if you just shrug and say *\u201dI don\u2019t know why he\u2019d rather use my bathroom instead of the one in his room that\u2019s bigger and nicer.\u201d* Focus on how uncomfortable it is to share with your stepdad. Tell jokes *\u201dYeah, I thought that being an only child would mean I would get my own bathroom but ever since my mom got married, stepdad ONLY uses my bathroom!\u201d* Don\u2019t forget to smile and laugh! You can say this in a light hearted funny way but to the adults in your life it basically makes him look like a pedophile. Make it a running joke that stepdad REALLY likes your bathroom *\u201dfor some reason.\u201d* This protects you from punishment.", "It's because he wants you to clean up after him. My stepdad and mom constantly used my bathroom, even though I was paying rent, and used my nicer towels, etc... because then they didn't have to clean their bathroom as much and they could do less laundry. This dude knows what he is doing. NTA.", "NTA, would it be possible for you to stop cleaning that bathroom and ask your mom to use hers?", "I came here to say this. Just use your mom\u2018s bathroom.", "This is the way.", "Yup. This is what I did when my mom didn't believe the state my brother left the bathroom in. A few weeks of me not cleaning it and she got the picture. Sometimes people who aren't living in the situation need to have a little more time to open their eyes to what is going on.", "And if none of that works look up emancipation laws in your area OP. NTA but this is one of those situations where it can turn sideways quickly. Make sure you have a place to go.", "She mentioned she\u2019s only 15", "Thank you!", "NTA.  But your mom is a major ah for marrying a guy she is unwilling to share a room with.  What the hell, why doesn't she let him use the master bath?  This marriage isn't going to last. Also, why doesn't she make him do chores like a grown up and clean the bathroom every now and then.", "Talk to your mom about how disrespectful you find it to have to bathe in the same room as her total slob of a husband. Ask if she can talk to him about cleaning up after himself or using the other bathroom so you can have some much-needed privacy. NTA but talk to your mom, not him.", "ORRRRR and I like this idea, move your stuff to your Mom's bathroom and tell her you two are sharing because as much as she doesn't want to share with a slob, neither do you. Promise her to clean up after yourself and that you'll chip in on cleaning it regularly, and make it clear you won't be using the other bathroom at all and that's her husband's responsibility now.", "Would mom support a lock for the door? If not, perhaps get some industrial gloves, garbage bags, and paper towels, remove all detritus and throw it all away daily. Consider all items on counter, as well as clothes, as abandoned  garbage. Daily. Drawer contents also sound like garbage, so maybe toss them or bag them and put in the other bathroom. The drawer can even  disappear for a while. Your mom can deciide whether she puts up with it - spouse's filth is not in your wheelhouse. Eventualitytually he will run out of xlotges.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d ask for a lock.", "NTA. Talk to your mom. She should be the one to bring it up to him. Just mention that there are major hygiene issues and you shouldn\u2019t have to clean up after a grown man. If you are polite about how you say it, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem (if she\u2019s a reasonable woman)", "NTA.  Talk to your mother.  Tell her what's going on.  Take pictures of everything.  If you can, move in with your father or a grandparent.", "NTA I would start using the master bath.", "NTA as everyone else said he knows what he is doing. Use the main shower and when mom ask why show her. She married him not you and your also not this guy's momma!", "This. OP, you need to talk to your mom. Tell her you aren't his parent, and you shouldn't have to talk to him about cleaning up after himself. They're married. They have their own bathroom. He should be using it.", "I would start sharing the bathroom with the mom.", "I just don\u2019t see it that way and I\u2019ll tell you why. He moved in about 4 ish years ago and we\u2019d (my mom, my sister, and me) already been living here for 7 years. He moves in makes all these messes and issues it\u2019s like my mom had another kid. It\u2019s also not his house its my grandmas and grandpas house if you want to get technical. I don\u2019t care if he adds $50 a month to rent I was to one that repainted the walls, added decoration, cleaned up messes, lived here before him. I cook and I clean and I do a lot of work around the house it\u2019s not like I\u2019m just living it up in here and he does nothing. I had a whole life in this house before he ruined it. It\u2019s not as simple as he\u2019s the adult especially because he doesn\u2019t act like one.", "No it's disgusting. If he wants to be treated as an adult he can behave like one", "Can you use the one in the master bedroom? Might be nicer and you can show your mum why", "Because she got tired of sharing with him. Ask her if you can share with her instead", "Start using your mom\u2019s instead", "That is very thoughtful, but the one thing you shouldn\u2019t be doing is cleaning up with her gross husband.

This is disgusting and if it were me I\u2019d feel it as an invasion of privacy. He has his own bathroom.

Get a few bins. Everything he leaves in your bathroom goes in the bin and then the bin goes in his room (soap boxes, wash rags, whatever). \n-Use your mom's bathroom. Yes, she's asleep, but yours is disgusting\n-Take photos for a week of everything he leaves. Make a PowerPoint presentation entitled \"Why I should be the only one to use the bathroom\" \n\nAnd count down the days till you can move out. Doesn't sound like this is the only problem. Get yourself some education and get out", "NTA.  Make a bigger mess.  Leave out tampons.

But are you sure this is a cleanliness thing and not an he\u2019s trying to foster an inappropriate relationship with his minor step daughter thing?", "NTA. Start using the shower with your mother. He uses yours because you have to clean it. And he refused to clean after himself. \nOr you can match his petty. Start leaving traces of your monthly laying around. And in the shower. Especially on his washcloths.", "NTA. Talk to your mom and express your concerns. If she isn't comfortable sharing the bathroom with him because he's a slob, ask her is she'll share the hall bathroom with you instead of him.

Sit down with a cup of tea. Ask her why and if she kicked hubby out of the master bath. Explain that it\u2019s gross in your bath and that as a 15 years old you need PRIVACY.  As a step kid you need privacy and her support. You should not be cleaning lady for Stepdad. Ask her to move hubby back into master bath.  As a second plan make sure you leave tampons, make-up, curling iron, hair curlers, small fuzzy animals and pink towels in your bath. Put k-pop boy pictures on the mirror. Make it a teen girl nightmare space for him. Drive him out!!", "Take photos of the bathroom then sit her down and say I can't use a bathroom left in this state.

Why is that? I don't know why that is but find your internal strength and tell these adults that grown ass man needs to use his own bathroom and stay out of yours. Kick up a fuss! Seriously. I bet he pees on the seat for you to clean up, am I right?  I don't even know what grounding means to you but if it means spending time in your room away from these people does it really matter if you're getting grounded for speaking your mind?  Meanwhile stop cleaning the house after these slobs.  And if they try to force you to clean up after that man do a real shitty job.  Pack up anything that he has left in your bathroom and hand to him and say no more.
