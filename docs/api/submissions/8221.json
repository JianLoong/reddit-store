Can you start using your mother\u2019s bathroom and let him use the one he\u2019s grossing out? Tell your mother it\u2019s because you\u2019re not his mother and there are limits, for Pete\u2019s sake.", "Unless mom's hubs has some disability, there's no reason he shouldn't clean up after. That's basic courtesy. Since it's your Mom's house, you may want to ask her privately what the deal is with this. You're NTA!", "NTA don\u2019t clean a thing for that man. Use the other bathroom, don\u2019t clean his dishes or anything", "NTA. Talk to him and your mom. Let him not do this. This is your bathroom. Selfish and strange of him to do this when there are other bathrooms in the house. And his own too.", "YWNBTA he's a gross old man and you shouldn't be cleaning up after him. Talk to him and your mom about it. He has a space he should be using and it's stupid that he's not. Tbh I find it kind of creepy that he wants to use only your bathroom.", "Ywnbta", "NTA he leaves his mess in there, dump it on his pillow. \n\nTalk to your mom about this. You should not have to be cleaning up after him. Does bathroom have a key? Lock it and use key to let yourself in. Or just start using the bathroom in master bedroom.", "My guess is that your Mom doesn\u2019t want to deal with it and has banished him to the other bathroom.", "NTA. This dude needs to clean up after himself, and also from the sounds of it just be a more functional human being, but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nCan you just start using your moms shower? When she asks why you or all your stuff is in there, you can say something about how you didn\u2019t know how to bring it up, but her husband has been using your bathroom to shower and leaving a complete mess every single time, and you just didn\u2019t have time/energy/whatever to clean it again today, when you just scrubbed the whole bathroom like 3 days ago, etc etc. If she says you\u2019re exaggerating, try to get her to go check it out, so she can see 1st hand the wet smelly clothes in the floor, trash everywhere, or whatever the case is this time. I think that might be your best bet to get it to stop. \n\nOther than that, keep locking the door when you\u2019re in there, because he\u2019s being weird - if for no other reason than from your comments he sounds lazy, and so he should want the ease of using the bathroom literally connected to his bedroom. That he doesn\u2019t? Weird.", "NTA - but *he* is! ugh. and a disgusting, mannerless pig of an AH, at that! has your mother seen the condition that he leaves your bathroom in? if not, please show her. more importantly, does your mother not see the importance of a teenage girl having her own, private space (when it's available, which in your home, it clearly is) that she isn't forced to share with a middle-aged male that isn't even her father? that's, at the very least, concerning, IMO. \n\nexplain to your mother that you'd like to have your bathroom back, and that you'd be really appreciative if she could talk to her husband and let him know that he needs to use his own bathroom, in their master suite, and refrain from using yours. i truly hope she is a good enough mom to have your back and do this, on your behalf.  i'm sorry you're having to experience this, in the first place. just...UGH. ultimate cringe.", "NTA - I was all prepared to call you T A, but the situation you describe is a bit odd and I think your step dad is being disrespectful of your shared space.  I\u2019d probably have the discussion with your mom first.  She married the slovenly guy.\u2014 she should solve the problem.", "Does he know the main bathroom in the house is only yours? Quite often the main bathrooms are better than the en suite. So perhaps might be more enjoyable to shower in, for example a power shower or walk in shower. \n\nhowever that doesn\u2019t mean that he can leave it filthy. He does need to clean up after himself. I\u2019d hate that too. \n\nBut don\u2019t forget some people have a household of 5 and share one bathroom. Count your blessings.", "He uses your bathroom as he doesn\u2019t want your mum hearing him let rip while she\u2019s in their bedroom! NTA. Gather up all of his gunk in a bag and dump it in his room. Tell him to clean up after himself or you\u2019ll keep doing it. He\u2019s being a total grub.", "So NTA for wanting some help and respect with keeping a clean shared space. However, the main bathroom is not your bathroom. Yes, they may have a bathroom attached to their bedroom but that does not mean the main bathroom of the house is off-limits to them. You said in another comment he puts money towards the rent. I have a feeling that one is going to be a losing battle for you as you said your mom always takes his side anyway. You should bring your mom into the bathroom and show her what it looks like and tell her that you can't live like that and maybe ask to share her bathroom that he doesn't use.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t know your relationship with this man, but that seems like such an invasion of privacy. Also he\u2019s 49 and hasn\u2019t learned to clean up after himself? I would tell your mom about this because she should be the one sticking up for you to her husband.", "NTA\n\nTell your mom.  How often is she in there to know any of this?", "NTA", "NTA.  Talk to your Mum about this, not your job to clean up after him.  If she refuses to do anything let her know that you will be using her bathroom from now on until her husband stops behaving like a disgusting pig in your bathroom.  If they try to lock you out of their room, denying you access to a clean bathroom and he leaves wet clothes on the floor etc, just get some kind of thing to lift them without touching them and start dumping them on the floor inside the doorway of their bedroom, if he doesn't clean the sink take the towels from your Mum's bathroom and use them to wipe it up and dump them on the floor too.  Put the trash he refuses to empty there too.  Just make sure none of it is yours.\n\nIt sounds like she kicked him out of her bathroom because he was disgusting, but you should not be expected to clean up after him. Your Mum needs to address the issue.", "NTA, but I'd say it's a conversation you should have with your mother, not with him. After all, she's the one bringing him into the house, so it should be her responsibility to clean up after him - kinda like having a pet.\n\nWhen you do have the conversation, though, try not to sound too much like an entitled teenager. You're used to having your own bathroom, but most kids your age have never had that, so don't act like it's a right. Instead, explain to your mother that, as shared space, it needs to be treated respectfully by all who use it. Not respecting the space is the same as not respecting the other people who use it. And don't enter into the conversation with demands (ie I want him to stop using my bathroom!) in mind - instead, enter into it with your problems ready to explain, and hopefully your mom will listen and be willing to help the three of you come up with a compromise so that everyone is happy in the end", "YWNBTA. He's being gross and messy in your space when he clearly has his own.", "NTA- sounds like he needs to learn to adult.", "YWNBTAH.  But talk to your mom first.  Point out you are a teenage girl and it is inappropriate for you to share a bathroom with your step father if it is avoidable. So if she won\u2019t stop him from using yours, you need to start using her bathroom.\n\nThere is a sure fire way you could make it so he never steps in your bathroom again.  But you are young, and it is a totally inappropriate suggestion.  So I will just leave it at that.", "There\u2019s something wrong here, and it\u2019s not you OP.
