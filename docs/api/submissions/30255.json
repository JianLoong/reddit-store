Some times I might be okay with a change in expectation the morning of, especially with such a last minute plan, and sometimes I wouldn't. Maybe I'm just more easygoing in that regard.

You're choosing in the moment whether to honor your commitment based on trivial factors,  not actual reasons.\n\nETA if your user name references what I think it does,  you're hilarious,  and you are allowed to be fickle because I'm dying laughing.", ">arm candy for volunteers\n\nWhere did it say anything about arm candy?
