{"id": 31043, "submission_id": "17w4bem", "title": "AITA for calling security on strangers using the gated community\u2019s pool and amenities?", "selftext": "Never thought I\u2019d sound so much like a Karen, but it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that.\n\nI (38F) live in Fort Lauderdale, FL in a community of about 40 homes and it\u2019s fully gated, so after some time you really get to know who lives in what house and who they typically have over as guests. Also, if you know anything about FL, this is the time of year many tourists flock to the area for warm weather. In our community, there\u2019s also a small rec center for families and has a gym and outdoor games/hangout/pool area that\u2019s paid for with residents\u2019 monthly HOA fees. My house is also directly next to the rec center, so my backyard is essentially attached to it and I can see everyone who uses the pool area.\n\nIn the last 2 months, I\u2019ve noticed huge groups of strangers and families show up for hours on the weekends to use the space. Music absolutely blaring until 1-2am, screaming kids everywhere, and they\u2019ll just ruin the space by leaving their trash hanging around and not cleaning up after themselves. I haven\u2019t done or said anything to the guests directly, but last weekend was kind of my breaking point. I have a trampoline in my backyard for my kids, but kids of the random families using the pool ran into my backyard and started jumping around on the trampoline. My dog was also outside during that time and they tried to feed him chips and other snacks they had. The whole situation just made me so anxious because I didn\u2019t want my dog to get sick or have the kids soaking wet from the pool to slip and get hurt on my property and have it be tied back to me.\n\nI immediately went into the pool to try and find their parents and when asked whose guests they were, all of them said one guy who lives down the street, Quinn (30s M). Ater talking to him I found out he\u2019s basically been putting up ads on Facebook marketplace where he\u2019s \u201crenting\u201d out our community rec center to random families and tourists in the area for cheap. Primarily, it\u2019s for families who are staying in nearby hotels that don\u2019t have nice amenities, and they come here instead. I thought it was absolutely absurd that he would do this with no thought for the others who live here, and let strangers in who he knows nothing about and won\u2019t even clean up after themselves.\n\nMyself and multiple other residents asked Quinn to take down his ad on Facebook and he refused, so we called the security on his guests and they were asked to all leave and Quinn is facing huge fines from the HOA for overstepping the guest policies. He\u2019s now calling me and others an AH and \u201celitists\u201d for not wanting strangers here, and while the majority of families here are happy and side with us, there are a few who think we should\u2019ve just let it be.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700083696, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w4bem/aita_for_calling_security_on_strangers_using_the/", "score": 368, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
