I have two children Raya( 4f) and Sam(1m). I have my ex who we will call Calvin and he is in his 30s. When I was in the military I was young and dumb and fell in love with Calvin.And so we continued to have a relationship when I got out of the military. He got stationed in Texas so I moved there to be with him because I was pregnant with his child (Raya). Things were okay until I got extremely sick. (Almost resulted in losing my baby because of how sick I got.) He would stay out late, he was buying expensive stuff that we couldn\u2019t afford and he didn\u2019t care that I was very sick. At 7 months pregnant you couldn\u2019t tell I was pregnant. So my parents flew me from Texas back to California. And they took care of me from there. Calvin came to visit me to see the birth of our child. During labor he was on his phone the entire time and he was not comforting at all. \n\nAnyways that was just a sum of how we met and what happened during my pregnancy with my first child. Onto todays current problem. So I\u2019ve made efforts into taking my daughter (Raya) to see his family twice, (mind you they live across the US and traveling with a young child is not easy). I\u2019ve even stayed there for a couple months both times so that I could try to align his leave time with the time that I could get off of work. Both those visits he did not make the effort to try to align his leave with my time off. So he didn\u2019t get to see her as my life does not revolve around his. He does not ask me how she is doing, he doesn\u2019t send financial support and he has not seen her since her birth (she is now 4). He used the military as an excuse as did his family, when for all of his leave he would be using it to see his family and to not see our child. His mother keeps bugging me to see my daughter but I\u2019ve gone to an attorney and the attorney said I\u2019m not required to let his family see the child due to his abandonment.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is wanting to adopt Raya and he\u2019s been the one to give her what she needs financially and emotionally and she calls him dad. He\u2019s been in her life since she was 18 months. So he is all she knows. But Calvin doesn\u2019t want to sign his rights away due to \u201chis pride\u201d. And he likes to use my decisions that I made when I was 19 against me. (I wasn\u2019t the most honest person but I\u2019ve done a lot of changing and growing in my life thanks to my fianc\u00e9.) I have family telling me \u201che\u2019s still the father\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d be a cold hearted btch\u201d. (And more of course LOL).  So Reddit.

You, for preventing your daughter from having family connections to her father\u2019s family if they are not harmful, and you from preventing a father from seeing his child.

They didn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, it sounds like they only care about a relationship with their grandchild when it\u2019s made convenient for them. If OP\u2019s baby daddy was my son, I\u2019d have kicked his ass something fierce for his shitty attitude and made sure to regularly check in with the child\u2019s mother to see if they needed help and be actively working on developing a relationship with the grandchild.\n\nNot the case with these grandparents.\n\nWhy should all the burden of travel etc be on OP when it comes to the paternal grandparents?", "Agreed. If there\u2019s a price tag attached, he may choose to keep tens of thousands of dollars rather than parental rights.", "Unless there is a physical reason for them to not travel, it shouldn't be.  She's described her visits there and not specified the other so we're left to speculate.  It could be that they are putting no effort in, in which case they are assholes too... but asking a lawyer if you have to allow them to visit bothers me.  I see a lot of her perception, but it doesn't feel particularly balanced.  \n\nFor example... I'm not sure leave, when in the military, is that easy to simply schedule to suit your ex's schedule.  If the grandparents are \"bugging to see\" the grandchild, are we sure they aren't willing to come to California.  She didn't mention \"bugging me to go there\".  And she mentioned two trips... in hopes that the ex would schedule his time for then.  That doesn't mean that the grandparents didn't travel to California.   It means that the ex didn't (or couldn't) schedule his leave for that time.  \n\nShe mentions having grown up thanks to the current fiance.  That may be true - but I think both parties are still a very long way from actually behaving like grownups.  \n\nThey are a group of adults.  Everyone involved should be working together to give that child an amazing life."]}
