You set a price that makes you happy and she either accepts it or denies it and looks elsewhere. You are currently charging waaaay below minimum wage, so $20 seems completely unfair, especially given that she isn't providing food or diapers.\n\nHonestly, even $40 sounds too low.", "NTA but I would encourage you to stop babysitting him. And to charge extra for any increased cost (diaper, food, etc).", "NTA - $20 for 9 to 10 hours of work is barely $2 per hour, that's insanely low. If anything, it should be even more than $40.", "NTA and keep in mind that as soon as you accept money you've opened yourself to a ton of legal issues over \"just watching a kid.\" Go see what a \"real\" daycare would cost this kid.", "I wouldn't do that for even $40 a day... You're literally losing money watching him, feeding and providing diapers. How are you going to manage in a month when you have 2 under 2 of your own...", "NTA - even $40 isn't enough. She also needs to start providing or at least compensating you for food and diapers.", "NTA. $40 seems crazy cheap for that length of time!", "NTA, you are spending that much in feeding him and keeping him in diapers, you should ask for the 40 and they need to bring a diaper bag with diapers, wipes and snacks. They also should be looking into new day care, because you certainly don't want to be chasing around 3 kids under 3.", "20$ a day? That's ALL? And she doesn't pay an additional fee for everything the child costs and consumes per day (water for washing up, DIAPERS, cleaning products to clean after him, drinks, food, toys he uses and wears out etc. etc.)\n\nFor 20$ you're basically playing UNICEF for them.\n\nHonestly, what's in it for you besides the extra work?\n\nWITH your own kid AND a kid on the way.\n\nNTA for doubling that sum.\n\n**(Personally I'd TRIPLE it)**", "NTA, I suggest $100 at least.  Especially when she doesn't provide food or diapers.\n\nHonestly, though, I would tell your friend that you can no longer babysit her child.  She can go look elsewhere.", "NTA - she needs to be providing for him if she wants to pay so little.", "NTA\n\n$20/10 hour day is $2/hour (minus cost of food and diapers) which works out to less than what I made babysitting 45 years ago.\n\nYou need to contact in home daycare providers in your area and find out what they charge per day for an 'in diaper' toddler (and whether they provide food or not). Also, parents should be providing diapers and a change of clothing for their child.\n\nOnce you find out the 'going rate' then you can undercut them by a couple of bucks, which would give your family member a break in price from what she would pay elsewhere, but would also be providing you with a fair price for taking care of her child.\n\nI would imagine you will get quotes of anywhere from $75 - $150/day PLUS parents provide diapers and a snack.", "Do you even have money left over from the $20, after you've paid for the kid's food and diapers?\n\n>undisciplined very aggressive only looking for an opportunity to hit or push my kid around\n\nUnless you really need the money, I would stop altogether.

I don't think she realizes the deal you're giving her there. \n\nI think you should ask for an hourly fee, minimum $10, but that's your choice.
