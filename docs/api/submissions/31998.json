You're literally losing money watching him, feeding and providing diapers. How are you going to manage in a month when you have 2 under 2 of your own...", "NTA - even $40 isn't enough. She also needs to start providing or at least compensating you for food and diapers.", "NTA. $40 seems crazy cheap for that length of time!", "NTA, you are spending that much in feeding him and keeping him in diapers, you should ask for the 40 and they need to bring a diaper bag with diapers, wipes and snacks.

Also, parents should be providing diapers and a change of clothing for their child.\n\nOnce you find out the 'going rate' then you can undercut them by a couple of bucks, which would give your family member a break in price from what she would pay elsewhere, but would also be providing you with a fair price for taking care of her child.\n\nI would imagine you will get quotes of anywhere from $75 - $150/day PLUS parents provide diapers and a snack.", "Do you even have money left over from the $20, after you've paid for the kid's food and diapers?\n\n>undisciplined very aggressive only looking for an opportunity to hit or push my kid around\n\nUnless you really need the money, I would stop altogether.

That\u2019s a big NOPE for me but if you\u2019re up for the hours, decide on a decent pay rate and let her know going for ward from XYZ date that the new rate will be that number.

She can agree and continue to drop off her son with you and pick him up 9-10 hours later.  Or she can disagree and not drop her son off with you.  What she can\u2019t do is negotiate differently.  She doesn\u2019t go to Safeway and talk to the manager about discounting the cost of groceries.  Nope.  She decides what to put in her shopping cart and pay for and go home with.

As a mom to an almost 2 year old you need to charge more. For example I occasionally have my husband's cousin babysit. I provide snacks, drinks, diapers, clothes and toys while she's babysitting. I pay $20 an hour. It doesn't matter that she's family, it doesn't matter that I'm broke. I am trusting somebody to watch my kid and no work should ever be free.

Oh, and $20/day, or even $40/day is slave wages.  If you were doing someone a real big solid, $10/hour would be extremely generous, $15/hour would be normal, and $20-40/hour for a problem child.  That should be over the diapers/snacks/lunch provided by the parents, if they are not providing those things, lean towards the $40/hr.", "This is atleast 80-90 per day. Huge NTA", "Sorry Sally I can\u2019t afford to watch you son anymore.", "NTA for asking. $20 is NOTHING for babysitting, it's ridiculously cheap.\n\nYou probably have to be prepared to stand your ground and have her withdraw her son altogether, but if you can survive without that $100 a week, then DO IT. It sounds like even $40 a day is too little", "NTA: $20 doesn't even pay for the diapers and food.

No less given everything you have said about her not providing anything for her son", "Just tell your family member that you need to stop providing daycare for her son in __ weeks.  You are getting ready for baby #2 and three small children will be too much.    Say nothing else. Don\u2019t engage in conversation about this.   Just:   I can no longer watch your pooper scooper.", "Nta . Thats literally labor. Does she wanna work for free?? No. So why tf should you?", "NTA you're taking ur time out in your day to watch him and provide the food and apparently diapers, which should be her responsibility  I would ask for 60$ cause top the stress even tho it's family  don't always mean ur a free time babysitter  once or twice maybe but If it's all the time then yea  she should understand", "Cash or do you provide a receipt?", "NTA. Even without any of the certificates I was charging $10 an hour when babysitting. Asking for $40 is literally so low when she should be paying minimum $100 a day tbh", "Nope. This boy is hurting OP's daughter. No amount of money makes that OK. OP says the boy looks for chances to hit or hurt her child. If this is true,  she should have stopped watching him the first time he went after her daughter.", "I agree.", "She\u2019s already going to work, so she could easily give you 1/2 her paycheck, right?

Childcare is hard work which is why daycare is hella expensive. She could pay you $20 per HOUR and still it would be less than hiring a nanny. Pretty sure your sister knows this and is just taking advantage of you. You deserve better and it sounds like the stress is not worth $40 a day either.", "Sweetie forgive me but that\u2019s a load of crap. You are doing 90% of their parenting. Their kid is going after your kid. Are you going to feel SAFE bringing a newborn into that situation?", "> This family member is my sister\n\nDoesn't matter at all.", "I do it bc she doesn\u2019t want to send him to strangers house or daycare and our mom tells us we have to help each other. Also my husband work slowed down and only averaging 35 hours a week so i thought a little extra money would help", "I was so incredibly grateful that we found a wonderful daycare for my daughter when she was a baby. The woman running it had a son that was literally hours older than my daughter and she managed really well. My daughter was safe. Later the daycare lady ended up having an affair with my husband but she did look after my child really well.", "If your mom says you have to help each other, then she can watch your sister's kid. If you have to provide his food and diapers, how much extra money are you really getting? And I think you should be more concerned about your daughter's welfare. There has to be a way to make some extra money other than letting your nephew beat up your kid.", "Well too bad for her. She can put on her big girl pants and find a trusted daycare like the rest of the world does. She\u2019s walking all over you for stupid as shit reasons."]}
