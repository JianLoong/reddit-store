{"id": 4051, "submission_id": "zdiizx", "title": "AITA for insisting that my husband find out who his biological father is?", "selftext": "For my husband to enlist in the National Guard, he had to give a copy of his birth certificate. When we asked his mom to provide one, she sent a \"keep sake\" type certificate. So we had to ask her to send the actual state filed official document. Once we received it we noticed that her name on the certificate was not her maiden name, and not the last name of my husbands dad. My husband's dad DID sign the birth certificate on the day of his birth. He was never told by his mother that she had had a previous marriage, or even really \"dated\" anyone before his father. She is the secretive type and likes to keep everything personal completely secrete (which I suppose is her prerogative). My husband already holds a fair bit of animosity towards his mom for being secretive, so he brushed this off as just another baggage item. Fine. OK.\n\nMe being nosey, was curious about the last name. When was she married? How long? So I got on the internet and did some record searching in that county. Well... turns out the year my husband was born, she was still married to this other man (hence her last name on the certificate). Only to be divorced that year shortly after his birth. What makes it more concerning is that 4 years later his mom filed to collect child support from this previous spouse. The man counter filed for visitation and she dropped the charges and it was left at that.\n\nI supplied this evidence to my husband. Of course he was upset. We agreed that no matter what, the man that had raised him was his father, and nothing would change that. We love him to death and wouldn't have it any other way. But you can understand that he was also very hurt by the fact that his mother had lied to him. And even if it's a possibility SHE herself may not know who the biological father is because of timing and the choices she made, its my opinion that my husband still has the right to know.\n\nThe reason I believe any of this pertains to me, is because we are trying to have a family of our own. We have been struggling with infertility and I just shudder to think that we don't know if there are any predisposing health concerns on his paternal side, if his dad really isn't his biological father. And maybe that doesn't give me the right to push him to find out? He doesn't want to make waves in the family, but his mother always asks why he is so distant with her. And he just holds so much resentment for the whole situation, that it hurts to watch it continue.\n\nSo AITA for continuing to bring it up, insisting he should try to find out what actually happened?\n\nor WIBTA for pursuing more information on my own? Is it my place?\n\nTLDR: My husbands mom hid that fact that she was married to another man at the time of his birth.

This is ENTIRELY up to your husband, and you need to stop pushing. If he wants your help, I'm sure he will ask. If he wants your support, I'm sure he will ask. Until then, mind your own family tree and stop trying to force him to do *anything* about his.", "You shudder???????????????????????? Jeez, I was very much n t a except for that line.", "YTA.", "YTA \n\n\nChildren can be tested for pretty much anything these days. This is all about your own curiosity and you shouldn't be pretending otherwise. It has nothing to do with you.", "\"WIBTA for pursuing more information on my own? Is it my place?\"\n\nYes, you would. It is not your place and honestly none of your business. You already opened up a can of worms and the more you snoop and pursue, the more cans you will open.", "YTA. Your husband obviously doesn't want to know who his biological father is. You should leave it at that.", "Man, this started off crazily similar to my ex husband's story. He needed a birth certificate at work. His mother has always been cagey about his bio dad, insisting that he left when my ex was 3 months because he thought she'd cheated and the baby wasn't his. She further claimed that his last name doesn't match his father's name, or her maiden name, because she was married at the time of his birth and the hospital required he take her husband's last name. \n\nWhen pushed, she produced a \"certificate of live birth\" instead of a legal birth certificate. Background check says she was never married to someone with that last name. No father was listed on the BC that we eventually applied for and received. She listed her maiden name as the name my ex husband was given. We still have no clue where this last name actually came from.", "My mother was adopted and my father wasn't part of my life after I was two years old. Medical history would have been nice, but I survived fine without. I raised two sons without it. You even have the option of genetic testing, which I didn't. Even if you could hunt this man down, he could easily refuse to interact at all and give you no information. \n\nYTA. Your curiosity doesn't give you the right to traumatize your husband and his side of the family.", "YTA he just found out life changing news and your concern is about you. He needs to make all the decisions about this and you need to support whatever those decisions are.", "Yta for forcing the issue. Get an at home DNA test. Chances are you'll find a cousin or someone in the paternal line & you can trace baby daddy from there.", "YTA. Check your family first before you start prying into his.", "YTA, this has nothing to do with you. Leave it alone, it\u2019s your husband\u2019s choice. His biological dad has nothing to do with your infertility. You\u2019ve upset him enough by being nosy and dropping a bombshell on him.", "YTA.  It's not your business period.  It's up to him to decide what's best for him.  It might feel like a mystery to solve for you but it's traumatizing for him and could blow up in both of your faces if the biological dad denies his paternity or any other information.  Stay out of it.  It's not your right to know.", "YTA", "YTA. If you\u2019re so worried your husband can do genetic testing to check for medical predispositions. I know how who both mt parents are and I still had all that done during pregnancy. This is obviously a sensitive topic for him and if he doesn\u2019t want to explore it that\u2019s his business.", "YTA. You must be an absolute nightmare to live with.", "Your husband has the right to know - but he also has the right to remain in ignorance if he so chooses. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Your reasoning for the DNA test can be solved by a doctor. Don\u2019t push someone to do things they aren\u2019t ready for, especially like that. I grew up without knowing who my real father was. I bought myself a DNA kit and it took me 3 years to feel ready to take it. You honestly can\u2019t begin to understand what he\u2019s going through if you haven\u2019t been there already.", "Soft YTA.\n\nWe have the same issue with my husband's family.\nMy father-in-law doesn't know his bio-dad and he did ask his mom and she won't tell him.  So that is a big question mark.  The issue is between them.  However, I understand potential impact on children since my daughter is severely autistic and we have no family medical history regarding my father-in-law's side of the family.  It is a concern that my daughter may suffer from seizures.", "YTA and said it yourself, you\u2019re being nosey. He can get medical tests done to find out what genetic markers he has. I don\u2019t talk to my biological mother and when my husband and I started trying for kids I was screened and tested.", "You said yourself you are nosy\u2026.and you are. This ain\u2019t your business lady. Seems like you are enjoying playing Nancy drew and putting little negative thoughts about your MIL in your husbands head then talking about it hurts to see it. If it hurts to see it then stop, you are the only one pursuing it\u2026just you. Yes YTA", "NAH.  There is significant doubt that the man who raised him is, in fact, his biological father.  If he is not, finding out medical history as well as other issues such as ADHD, dyslexia, mental illness would be really helpful.  I don't know that genetic testing can catch all of that, but I could be wrong.  I also get the husband not wanting to pursue it given his strained relationship with his mother.", "Info: did you ever get any fertility testing done, and did any of those tests ever indicate genetic issues?", "YTA it's not your business in any way shape or form", "NAH yet.... Except maybe his mom. Respect his wishes. If you can't live without knowing, don't tell him. But I'd argue dna testing is at a level to help with preexisting conditions without stirring the pot.", "NAH Having his real genetic history is vital. If he doesn't want to get it, you have the right to not have kids with him, but that's all you can do.", "I\u2019d want to know the heritage of my children too ,", "NTA. you have a right to know what potential health issues your children could have", "This is a pretty perfect answer. There are plenty of genetic testing options for health that don\u2019t involve this drama. \n\nHubs set a boundary, OP needs to respect it.", "i think husband's issues with his mom are due to OP hounding about all this stuff that might have happened and all the lies that might have been told.", "Not only that, but would you NOT have children if you found some kind of genetic \"problem\"? If you would not let that information determine whether or not to have children, you don't need this information, and to push your husband or go behind his back just makes you nosy and/or controlling. Let it be.", "That's not necessarily true. \"Fertility issues\" doesn't mean \"absolutely cannot have children\".", "Well, that's simply not true. A not insignificant amount of people with male factor infertility will go on to produce children. Just like all the people with female factor infertility can and do on a regular basis. See PCOS for example.\n\nIt can be extremely important to understand the male genetic line. \n\nHowever I really get the vibes from this poster that they are just craving the tea on this one. So I agree with your verdict of YTA.", ">Clearly the man didn't have fertility issues or your husband wouldn't be here.\n\nYou read my mind as I was reading.", "Untrue that is NOT how genetics works. Additionally she is right and there could be health problems to worry about. Now I\u2019m not saying she couldn\u2019t just go get genetic testing done, hell they both can! I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to so easily dismiss health concerns.", "OP can get genetic testing done for all that health risk info. She\u2019s just being mosey and using it as an excuse.", "Even if the biological father did have fertility issues since having children doesn't negate issues, just infertility. You never know what is passed down to the child. The only way to actually know would be to test he partner and it's the only thing that makes the most sense", "This was first brought up around his early 20s (we weren't married then and we kind of let it go). It got brought up again because we are filing for passports in our 30s.", "Not that I can see into the past or anything like that, but that was my thought too after reading when he asked for visitation if she wanted to get child support. She obviously didn\u2019t want him around for reason unknown & would rather be poorer than see him again.", "She could have been having an affair and the kid isn\u2019t his too just because she was married and he\u2019s on the birth certificate doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s the dad.", "this is exactly what i thought!  or when first husband called her bluff and asked for visitation she passed and withdrew the papers.", "But it's not her place to pursue it", "by definition- if you produce children, you are not infertile. Don't overthink this. This is a made-up excuse.", "Most people don't know their grandparents entire health history. And even if you somehow do, which you probably don't because medical info is private especially to older generations, does not mean you are not genetically pre-disposed to a ton of stuff that your grandparent just did not happen to suffer from, or know that they suffered from.", "So around 10 years ago it was first mentioned. He decided not to delve too far into it (he probably already knew, or had an inkling) and not pursue the matter.\n\nIf he was generally happy with the parents that raised him & feels no need to find out the \"truth\" that may cause strife between him & his mother, do not push it.\n\nYTA to keep on insisting.", "So you married him knowing that this wasn\u2019t something he wanted to pursue and knowing you would be trying to have children without a complete medical history, correct?\n\nI do understand that infertility can be painful and can make us start looking for answers and solutions anywhere and everywhere. But in this case, you are trying to turn over a stone that has a very, VERY slim possibility of giving you any useful information and an almost non-existent chance any information would make any difference in your fertility journey.", "Wait I thought it was needed because he was enlisting in the National Guard? How was he able to get a license before this?", "Having fertility problems doesn\u2019t necessary mean you\u2019re *infertile* though. And not to mention, even people who have been told they can\u2019t have kids, have had them. Like\u2026 Just google that. \n\nIt\u2019s not a made up excuse. Cross my heart."]}
