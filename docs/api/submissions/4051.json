When we asked his mom to provide one, she sent a \"keep sake\" type certificate. So we had to ask her to send the actual state filed official document. Once we received it we noticed that her name on the certificate was not her maiden name, and not the last name of my husbands dad. My husband's dad DID sign the birth certificate on the day of his birth. He was never told by his mother that she had had a previous marriage, or even really \"dated\" anyone before his father. She is the secretive type and likes to keep everything personal completely secrete (which I suppose is her prerogative). My husband already holds a fair bit of animosity towards his mom for being secretive, so he brushed this off as just another baggage item. Fine. OK.\n\nMe being nosey, was curious about the last name. When was she married? How long? So I got on the internet and did some record searching in that county. Well... turns out the year my husband was born, she was still married to this other man (hence her last name on the certificate). Only to be divorced that year shortly after his birth. What makes it more concerning is that 4 years later his mom filed to collect child support from this previous spouse. The man counter filed for visitation and she dropped the charges and it was left at that.\n\nI supplied this evidence to my husband. Of course he was upset. We agreed that no matter what, the man that had raised him was his father, and nothing would change that. We love him to death and wouldn't have it any other way. But you can understand that he was also very hurt by the fact that his mother had lied to him. And even if it's a possibility SHE herself may not know who the biological father is because of timing and the choices she made, its my opinion that my husband still has the right to know.\n\nThe reason I believe any of this pertains to me, is because we are trying to have a family of our own. We have been struggling with infertility and I just shudder to think that we don't know if there are any predisposing health concerns on his paternal side, if his dad really isn't his biological father. And maybe that doesn't give me the right to push him to find out? He doesn't want to make waves in the family, but his mother always asks why he is so distant with her. And he just holds so much resentment for the whole situation, that it hurts to watch it continue.\n\nSo AITA for continuing to bring it up, insisting he should try to find out what actually happened?\n\nor WIBTA for pursuing more information on my own?
