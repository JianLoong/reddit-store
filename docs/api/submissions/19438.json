Kinda feel like your mom and sister are micro managing his life and if not he can sleep on their couch", "NTA, and since he is allergic to cats I'd flat out say No and hold firm because if he is truly allergic to cats, having his own room isn't going to alleviate that issue and eventually they'll be pressuring you to rehome the cats so that he can stay there comfortably.   \n\n\nIts a give an inch, take a mile scenario.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And what happens in 5 months that he will no longer require shelter from you?", "NTA. You offered and did your best", "He is established elsewhere and would probably not appreciate what his mom and aunt tried to do. Does he even know? I\u2019m sure he has a lease to consider. NTA", "NTA.  Sounds to me like your nephew\u2019s mama and grandma don\u2019t want him to keep enjoying the level of independence he has now.", "NTA\n\nYou will never get him out once you let him in. And your mom and sister will always think you are the assholes for not letting him stay forever.", "NTA. They want you to sleep on a couch in your own apartment for at least 5 months because you need to A) give up your bedroom or B) give up your office to your nephew? That is one of the most ridiculous requests I've heard in a long time. Don't give in to this nonsense.", "I think it\u2019s more like a saving-money-on-rent thing.

This is not your problem and they are entitled for expecting it.", "NTA - why is this nephew looking for new accomodations?  was he kicked out by his existing room mates?  $340 per month sounds fine to me\n\nHe can move in with your mother, if she feels he should live for free with family\n\nYou are a woman and how dare a woman have a home of her own, live how she chooses, .  Perhaps they think yo will in some ways mind him and not charge him rent\n\nYou will never be rid of him if he is comfortable.  He him share the room with the cats and die there", "NTA... your home is crafted to fit your needs. What your sister is asking for is for you and your petss to all be inconvenienced for 5 months so that your nephew could save some money? This is not an emergency, they are only thinking about what benefits them. Their request is very selfish.", "NTA. Your apartment is comfortable for you and your cats, but is not large enough to comfortably accommodate another person.

If he has a place, why does he need to move in with you?  Sounds like has a place.", "NTA.  That's a hard pass.  Unsolicited advice:  NEVER agree to something like that without taking a day or two to sleep on it.  Just say, \"that's a big ask, I need some time to think about it.\"  If they push for a decision, \"you know, I need time to think about it, but if you need an answer now, it has to be \"no\" because no is the only option I have without thinking about it.\"  What is there to think about?  \"That's why I need to think about it because I have no idea what the ramifications are.\"", "NTA he has allergies to cats and your mom, your sister and he can figure something else out.  Do not let him move in as it will not be 5 months and when you finally decide you have had enough and decide to kick him out, you will face huge drama in the future.  Avoid all drama and say no!", "No not at all", "Then it is on him, his mom, and grandma(since she is sticking her nose in) to figure it out, not OP.  Maybe gm and mom can pay his rent or he gets another job and goes to school if they can't."]}
