I argued that it\u2019s just as greedy to expect others to give you their food as it is not to give it. She said I had a problem and now I was teaching him the same.

As child I would order what I wanted, sister ordered burger or club sandwich,  once meal arrives sister wants to try my meal. So half my meal is moved to sister\u2019s plate, sister doesn\u2019t share I don\u2019t care for her choices. Other situation sister would not like her burger so I was forced to share 1/2 my food because sister was hungry so I should not be greedy and share. I once asked why sister didn\u2019t just order what she wanted instead of expecting me to share\u2026 my entire meal was given to sister and I was sent to the car because I was greedy and unreasonable. Now I\u2019m hungry because I didn\u2019t get all of my food or I\u2019m punished for not sharing. By early teens I refused to eat out with parents and sister because it was never a pleasant experience. Husband was only child he had no opinions about food sharing once we had children. Our take if child A shared with child B then if child A is still hungry I order more food. That way child A feels it\u2019s ok to share because child A knows there will be more food if still hungry. But no one is ever forced to share, order what you want and eat it but don\u2019t expect to share my food.  No one should be shamed for not sharing something that is theirs this only causes resentment and hard feelings.", "Nta forced sharing *isn't* sharing", "NTA Forced sharing is not actually sharing, it's just a shakedown at that point. It often makes the person who is forced to share less inclined to share in the future.", "NTA - you're teaching him boundaries.  Your wife is the AH, though.

Especially food.", "You need to have a discussion with your wife on parenting situations.  How about a rule like -  \"you get to keep the food you order when everyone orders their own meal.... UNLESS someone has offered you some of their meal. IF you accept, THEN you have to share yours proportionately if they ask. But only if you accept their offer first.\"  Then EVERYONE (including Mom) knows what the rules are and doesn't need to pressure anyone to do anything they don't want to do.", "NTA I think it's important to allow them the choice to share because forced sharing creates hard feelings for everyone involved. It also makes them less likely to want to share of their accord later on if they associate sharing with negative feelings which created when a parent creates a dynamic where they have no choice but to give up part of what they have. Like you said, he can say no but when he says no he should consider how it makes other people feel when he says no or how it makes him feel when others say no to him wanting to be shared with. The only thing I'd say is this is an argument to have not at the table or in front of the kids. Parents undermining each other is not a good look.\n\nAlso was the kid full? I got the impression he was done with his meal so instead of pestering the other to share why not just ask the younger one if he even is still hungry? It seems your wife was more so trying to prove a point or something instead of being concerned about sharing when the younger sounds like he might not even have more room for food. It could have been that simple.\n\nNeither one of you is wrong, but I have to say when you order meals as individual plates if someone wants to share food that needs to be discussed ahead of time. I share with my husband but sometimes he wants to pick meals together so we can have some of both and I'm just not in a sharing mood. I'm hungry and I want all MY food. Eating out is a treat and I order things I can't make at home so I'm probably going to be wanting ALL of it. He accepts that and orders accordingly.

Each marriage will have its challenges, and adding in different cultures may make it even harder. Strong communication is an absolute must. \n\nYou and your wife need to come to an agreement about sharing food with each other, and then about how you will model that behavior and talk to your children about that behavior. And get to the heart of the matter; don't just talk about your cultures. Even in the US, there is a lot of variation on food sharing in families and regions. What *personal* significance does sharing food have to her? Maybe it means family bonding, mutual caring, showing love, etc. And why are you *personally* so opposed? Is there food scarcity in your history or something else? After listening to understand each other, find a way to compromise. \n\nAlso, talk out some past examples to see how you can handle them moving forward. For example, in the scenario you shared, little bro was full so offered the rest of his food to big bro. Why would big bro share his food in this instance? Little bro is not hungry anymore and it's more unhealthy to eat when you're full than it is to not share. \n\nYou guys need to figure this out and not bicker about it in front of the kids.", "The only thing that worries me is if you're going to give your kids a complex about food because you two can't agree.

We live in a privileged world of plenty, they are not going to starve, right? It\u2019s difficult to take yourself out of the equation I understand, but step back and think: which approach will see my sons onto a better path? It\u2019s such a minor thing in the grand scheme, to be willing to share food, but it can make a really big impression on others. I don\u2019t accept your premise that your disinclination to share food from your plate is \u201cAmerican\u201d. Its probably familial. Did you have brothers and sisters?

I think her tendency to emphasize sharing food comes from a culture of not having \u201cmy plate\u201d whereas Western culture emphasizes \u201cmine\u201d.

I didn\u2019t mean this post as a judgment of culture. Can you help me understand why including cultural information is worthy of being left?", "With each other? It can depend. I am generally accepting of a bite and probably get frustrated with a bigger portion. In the case with the kids it was a single bite.", "I am teaching my kids to \"balance sharing\" example, there are certain toys that are their security toys and they don't have to be shared with others but maybe there is another toy they are willing to share (we play trade-ya with kids to little to understand \"security toys\").\n\nWe also don't allow sharing of food until everyone is finished with their plate unless it's just a bite to try, then you can ask, and the person being asked can say no. Once everyone is finished with their plates, then we can share or swap plates. This is our way of making sure that the one who ordered the dish gets to enjoy it as much as they want first while then making sure people can try a new dish and are all full when the meal is over.\n\nI would be having a talk to your wife about her insistence on forcing food sharing because that is 1 taking away the kids ability to consent 2 can cause issues around food 3 with young kids can cause allergic reactions if the kid being shared with is unaware the food they are requesting to try has an ingredient they are allergic too.\n\nYes it's her culture but she shouldn't be hindering her child's ability to consent, as parent we use innocent consent situations (like asking for a hug or to share food) to help our kids learn how to set boundaries so that when they get older they can say no in more serious situations.", "You don\u2019t mention where you are raising your children.

If you are raising kids in a shared plates culture, then I would suggest teaching them to share.", "Your wife thinks something that you do everyday is selfish, and then is telling your son when he exhibits the same behavior as you that he is selfish. That's a big problem. \n\nIf she has an issue with you, she needs to work through it WITH YOU and possibly a counselor, given how long this is going on. She should not be shaming you using your son as a proxy, and she shouldn't be shaming your son. He's a child -- he's not selfish, he's a person with limited agency who would like control over this one thing where he has control. It's absolutely normal behavior for a child or even an adult. I would never go out to eat with an adult who forced me to share my food if I didn't want to, and I would consider the person forcing the sharing to be extremely disrespectful to me.\n\nI feel like there's a major issue to work through with your wife. She thinks that this piece of you that sounds like it is fundamentally you --having control over your food -- is a trait of selfishness.  So then the next question -- maybe *this* isn't selfish but are you selfish or controlling in other ways? Do you have a car or a room that no one else is allowed to use? Do you buy packages of treats that no one is allowed to have? Do you have more free time or social time than your wife?  Do regular daily occurrences have to be done in a certain way?  Maybe food sharing is a proxy for something else, or maybe your wife really needs to understand that this is a part of you and she's being critical and hurtful.  \n\nWhether your resistance to sharing stems from the culture you grew up,, trauma, sensory issues, neurodivergence 1) if this is something inheritable (sensory issues, neurodivergence, undiagnosed food intolerances) that your son has strong odds of having them too and 2) shaming and being controlling with food will be traumatic for your son and cause him to have issues with food.\n\nI got three kids. When my eldest was born I thought you had to make kids share. Turns out that doesn't really teach anyone to share, and it just creates a disconnect between you and your kid. I also had to learn that shaming is not parenting. I thought I was doing better because I wasn't using hitting to control my kids and then I found out that shaming is also not constructive for healthy emotional development. All the tools my parents used! Dang it. \n\nAnd last, it's parenting 101 that if you want something from your kids stop asking for it, and start living it.  I get exhausted modeling and just want them to do the dang thing but when we force them it throws us back in the process. They have to do the hard work of reestablishing their autonomy again before they can even begin to absorb what we're modeling.   I learned my lesson the hard way potty training my oldest. I still feel ashamed at the situation I created with my own need for control and believe that I could make someone else do something.  When I finally let go the situation resolved itself... A year later. By then I had made this such a thing that it took a year for her to come around to it on her own.  \n\nNTA.  I don't know anything else about you as a parent so maybe there's areas where you need better tools, but on this your wife is being hurtful and you guys need to work through this because it's going to grow.  The older your kid gets the more he will need to demonstrate his autonomy and control over choices and objects.  Will her response be to tell him to be a different way?", "Well reading your story it seems that both of you just can't see why it matters to the other person. And are ready to condemn each other's behavior.\nEven if you found a way to avoid confrontation you really didn't 'solve' the issue. And frankly it really doesn't need solving. \nIf you understand why it's important to her and she understands your feelings you could try to explain each other's point of view to your kids and let them decide how they handle it. Ofcourse that will come once they are couple of years older. In the meantime:\nIn my opinion it's far more important to teach your kids respect and emphatie for a view that differs from theirs than it's to teach them to share or not. They'll figure that out for themselves. According to what matches best with their character.

It\u2019s perfectly fine to say you want to eat what you\u2019ve ordered. It\u2019s not selfish to order something you know you like and not want to give it away.

Another poster gave some great feedback and we are gonna have a convo about how we can best model for our kids. I want to assure you that this isn\u2019t a daily issue about food.

My suspicion is that, as another user mentioned, food is a really important way of showing love in Chinese culture.

In such cases, the assumption in Chinese cuisine is shared and the assumption in white American is individual (unless eating at certain specialty restaurants).

I don\u2019t remember sharing burgers or sandwiches with my dad or grandparents.  I do remember sharing at some Chinese and Italian restaurants.  \n\nIf you want to argue that Americans are more selfish than some other cultures, I can mostly agree with that, but, I don\u2019t see it as Chinese or Asian people are more of a sharing culture.  If nothing else, there are multiple cultures in China that are larger than the population of the US.

Except for Yum Cha (I think called Dim Sum in America). \n\nIt was Thai we went to the other week where one person had distinct preferences and so ordered a dish for themselves, and then the rest of us shared. We made it clear she was welcome to try any of our food if she wanted, but there was no expectation that she had to share hers. It\u2019s about mutual respect. \nAnd sometimes I\u2019ve been in the mood for  specific dish and not wanted to share, and that\u2019s ok too.", "Great point.

But she only gets to make decisions about her food, not what anyone else does with their food. She should not be forcing other people to set aside their boundaries for her. That is selfish.", "I'm going to say NTA. \nLet me go a bit deeper. \n\nTraditionally, Chinese culture places a lot of emphasises on sharing resources amongst family. It comes through heaps of little things. Giving up / sharing your resources is seen as a virtue. It's part of being considerate and polite. \n\nNow this is traditional culture, by no means am I saying everyone does this (they don't lol) or that it is the right way (I don't agree with a lot of it). \n\nAnyway, traditional Chinese food is sharing plates. If you have a plate of stir fried brocoli and beef. What it someone only wants the meat and picks it all out? Or what if someone is super hungry and demolishes half the plate? What are others going to eat? So kids are being told to be considerate when they eat. It's not just about eating to satisfy yourself, but being polite socially. \n\nThere's a lot of emphasis on maintaining a polite front socially. Socially, when you received a gift, you are also expected to return a gift. So this will be why when son #2 shared first and your wife ask son #1 if he wants to share. The expectation is that \"someone did something for you you should (at least pretend or offer) the same favour back\". \n\nNow no doubt you know traditional Chinese culture places a lot of emphasis on family. You are meant to help your family out and share resources. Sacrificing/inconvenience yourself for your immediate family is a virtue. (again, not saying everyone is doing this) \n\nIn America and some other western countries, people are more individualistic. You got something, it's yours. You don't have to share with anyone. You need to look after yourself foremost. Traditional Chinese culture wants you to be \"part of the team\", and not just think about yourself. You need to be polite and maintain face (regardless whether if you like it or not). And your family is more important than just you. \n\nYou can see how this is two different view points. \nFrom your perspective this may be all BS. Why should you make yourself uncomfortable if you don't want to? Just because you are happy to give me food doesn't mean you can emotionally blackmail me to do the same. \n\nThere's no right and wrong here it's all just different perspectives. It doesn't matter about you adults (you sort it out amongst yourselves), but it is confusing for your kids to get mixed messages. So you should have a chat with your wife and come to some agreement. \n\nI think you'll be able to discuss this with your wife better if you can target where she's coming from. When son #2 shared and son #1 didn't, I don't think for her it's just a matter of \"son #1 being little greedy guts\". She'll be thinking \"oh no he's going to grow up to be an inconsiderate selfish person if he won't even offer food to his brother\". Maybe let her know that you also want to teach your kids good virtues like helping others and caring and sharing and loving his brother. But, you also don't think a child being forced to do something is good. Maybe your son is more than happy to share toys or do other good things. Let your wife know that maybe his food is something he doesn't want to share and that's OK. Everyone has something they don't want to share. \n\nGood luck to you.", "NTA but this is why as an Asian American to immigrants I had different rules for different people.

Firstly, unless a family is in poverty and relies on food stamps and have very limited food supplies (unto which sharing food is important for human survival)... sharing food where income isn't an issue is ridiculous.

I have several dietary restrictions (religious and allergy) so food on my plate has to be my \"safe foods\". Others around me have no restrictions and can order anything they want. I need my safe food, they don't. I'm also a believer in reciprocity, so if someone offers me something, I feel compelled to offer in return.

However, she is living in the US and married to a white American so adjustments have to be made.", "Sharing food is also a part of other cultures outside of China, and a part of some American cultures, which include white people.", "I would suggest you go to different restaurants that have different approaches to sharing food to show your kids what situations are sharing situations and which aren't. Also FYI plenty of Americans do sharing, it's often called \"ordering family style\" because it mimics the at home type of eating where all the shared food goes in the center and you load up your individual plate with a bunch of different items. People do this at American restaurants to and it is very normal.", "I think the cultural aspect is more about how meals are served in restaurants in this case, because it seems to be an issue when they are eating out. Americans tend to order a meal that is plated and brought to an individual, where some cultures prefer family style where food is brought to the table and you select what you want out of the options on the table.", "I find it off putting that sharing a bite is ever a problem. I love sharing food and would probably have a really hard time with someone who feels the need to not even share a bite. In most restaurant meals, there\u2019s probably easily 100 bites, getting bent out of shape about being asked to share a single bite is just so\u2026..off putting to me.", "And because she is living here I need to change more to make her comfortable as well. That\u2019s what marriage is. Thanks for the chat. Have a good one and enjoy your curry.", "I am American. Many people of different cultures indulge in the tapas type of culture ime. My experience growing up was respect people who don\u2019t want to share but there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking to share respectfully, either.", "Okay so you are in the US with different culture but let me ask you, between your children, do you want to foster a sense of a team between them, where they look in each others plates and think 'i have something here you should try and i think youd would like'? When you and your wife will be gone, that they would have each others back and knew they could always count on each other? I think this is what your wife is trying to instill in your kids. Sure that's just food but I think its obvious how different family closeness is between two cultures. Which one do you like applied to your family and whatever you two decide you and your wife should be the example so they could emulate it.", "I think this is great but I also hope you talk to your wife about this idea before just launching in in front of the kids. \n\nIt sounds to me like the culture difference runs very very deep. Saying \u201crequiring/expecting sharing is bad\u201d could sound to her like saying her culture is wrong and yours is right (unless you both already agreed that requiring sharing is bad, but it didn\u2019t sound like it in your post). To me it sounds like she strongly believes that sharing should be expected/required within the family at least. \n\nDropping that line in front of the kids as if it\u2019s the resolution to the dispute could feel like sandbagging her.", "I agree. That\u2019s absolutely the spirit I want them to have. I want them to support one another and to have each other\u2019s backs. I also want them to respect and not take advantage of one another. I don\u2019t think forcing them to share individually chosen meals will actually make them have one another\u2019s backs. I think it causes resentment. It also teaches them that they can take what the other has if they want it. \n\nIt\u2019s a balance and I think how I grew up isn\u2019t the best way, but maybe neither is how she did.", "But younger son said he was done and full and that's when he shared his food. So why would older son share after his brother had already said he didn't want more? That just seems weird to me.", "younger son wasn't sharing - younger son was full and gave away the rest of the food he didn't want to eat\n\nif the point of a meal is family style sharing then sure, order a whole bunch of things for everyone to sample, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to share an individual plate and all this 'family should share' stuff is guilt tripping bullshit", "But OP did encourage his son to share? He said \"It would be nice to share, but you don't have to if you don't want to\".\n\nIn my opinion, that is a valuable lesson to learn about not giving in to pressure. \"Just because they did something for you, does not mean you are obligated to return the favour\". Its a really important lesson about consent and can translate well into a child having firm boundaries and not getting walked over. I think NTA", "Really confused why someone should get to eat food you ordered for yourself? With a large family, you could end up with very little of your original meal! If what you have looks good to others, they should remember and order it next time.", "Thanks for the advice. We talked about it and my concerns tonight. I asked her what she wanted emphasized and we agreed on what we\u2019d say.", "Woo Hoo! Conflict, Communication, Resolution. (Or compromise) You guys are awesome!", "It\u2019s called AmItheAsshole, but I used it more like RelationshipAdvice. Probably got better advice, too.\n\nThere were some crazy replies though. Some people are wildin\u2019", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Yes, the crazies are alive and kickin\u2019"]}
