A mastectomy is an example of a change that many women go through, sometimes by choice as a preventative measure, and with how OP was responding to his wife getting a tattoo there's a good chance he would respond very negatively to his wife needing a mastectomy.\n\nAnd she very much did run the tattoo by him.
