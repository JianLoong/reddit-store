Then you say that after she's gone to school, the two of you can pick out a tattoo together to \"get her a nice one.\" The way you've phrased a lot of this sounds like you are the gate-keeper and she's only allowed to do things that please you. That's not the sign of a good relationship.\n\nSecond, while you say \"people should have control over their own bodies\", you negate that immediately by saying, \"but we've been married for years and I feel like it's messed up to make a decision like that without even consulting me.\" It's like you feel SHE isn't allowed to have bodily autonomy, even though other people should have it. \n\nHOWEVER... \n\nIf she was going to unilaterally make this decision, why did she ask you in the first place? This is where she sucks in this equation. Perhaps it's just her way of asserting her autonomy after years of putting up with you being large and in charge. IDK.

This is the part where you should feel betrayed because she violated trust by asking and then disregarding your answer entirely. The fact that she got a tattoo you don't care for is not a betrayal; it's a difference in taste perhaps, but not a violation of trust.

It sucks if you don't like it, but you don't get to have input on what the design is, no matter how impulsive it is. I have many tattoos. My husband doesn't necessarily like all of them. He doesn't have to, they're on my body and are about me.\n\nI see two issues here, though, and while on one you're not really T A because it sounds like unclear expectations with no explicit agreement on when to consult one another on expenses, you definitely are for your TA for your response to the tattoo and the very belief that you are entitled to input.

We had an appointment to make the down payment on Monday and now she\u2019s saying she doesn\u2019t want to go.", "I\u2019m an accountant and she works part time at a gym so I make way more than she does but I\u2019ve never seen it as my money and her money, it\u2019s OUR money. She did use the money we were saving though.", "He is her husband. He has no right to control what she does with her body but it's not against the \"rules\" to express his thoughts on it and how it affects his attraction to her. They are supposed to be partners.", "go out and buy yourself something.. your money, your choice..", "Wtf did you even read the post? OP said yes to getting a tattoo after they got the money together. If she wanted to make a choice about her body, why does she have to use HIS money to do it? You're correct in that a person has every right to choose what to do with their body. But shit, your spouse also has every right to have an opinion about it. OP has a right to find it ugly and be less attracted to her as a result.", "What if it's really ugly though", "I mean if it\u2019s ugly, a waste of money that they really need, she shouldn\u2019t have put it on her body. It\u2019s not her body her choice when it comes to being in major debt without helping him out. That\u2019s irresponsible.", "This is the comment I was looking for. Exactly right. \n\nESH.", "He doesn\u2019t get to make decisions regarding her body, but he absolutely has the right to input. And he has the right to not want to look at some tacky cheap tattoo on his partner\u2019s body, she has no right to tell him how to feel about it.", "how is he disgusting for feeling like the tattoo is ugly you're acting like there has never been an ugly tattoo lmao. he doesn't have to like it", "The question is, does he have to run spending $20 by her? Or does he do it when she never asked or expected it from him, because *he* assumes that's something he should be doing? \n\nIf she asked him to check with her if he's spending $20 or more, or if she simply expected him to do that without overtly asking, then yes, she's TA for spending $100 on her own recognizance. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. \n\nIf he simply came up with the belief that he should be asking at that level on his own, while she has been fine all along with his spending $100 or more on his own without checking it with her, and only expects the same courtesy, then she didn't do anything wrong. \n\nIn either case, they really need to sit down and talk over what their expectations of each other really are about money use, and make sure they're equal.", "He\u2019s upset about both, so ESH for me.", "This opinion doesn't sound biased at all", "A mastectomy is not anywhere equivalent to a tattoo. \n\nNTA. Ultimately getting a tattoo is her choice, but you have every right to not like it. And as a married couple,  I would think that a permanent change to your body is something you would minimally run by your spouse- if only to discuss it first. \n\nI still cannot believe a tattoo is being compared to breast cancer though.", "Yea the picking tattoos out together had me scratching my head", "My husband wants an Irish tribal tattoo.  I see them as dated.  But if that's what he wants, I love him enough to know it's his body.", "Only thing that\u2019s bothers me is he is working to get the money for her to go to school. That makes her TAH but wanting to pick out a tattoo together is weird", "But he told her they can't afford it because he has to pay for her schooling in a few weeks? It's not about him controlling her, it's about them working together to pay for something that's for her and she decided to work against him just because. She could have waited to get the tattoo when they were in a more financially stable position.", "Well all very true what about the fact that she asked to get one and he said no to the fact that they need to save money for her schooling and she still went ahead and spent the money? Is she not the AH for spending money that OP thought that they should be saving?", "I agree with you. I agreed with most people about him being in the wrong for disliking it, and she being in the wrong for spending money when they had agreed to save. \n\nBut what didn't sit right with me was his comment about her ruining her beautiful body. I definitely got some over control undertones in that one.", "There is no fun money because he is paying for her school.", "You're completely missing the fact that she spent $100 on this tattoo after he told her they can't afford it because HE'S trying to save $4,500 for HER school. This isn't just about him hating her tattoo, it's about her blatant disrespect for how hard he's working to put her through school. They're supposed to be a team and she just went rogue because it suited her. \n\nNTA OP, I'm sorry you have a selfish wife.", "That could be nerves getting to her.  Or possibly digging in because she's hurt about the tattoo.  \n\nI'm not a psychologist, but this sounds like something my son would do.  He has ADHD and ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) and would always rather have immediate gratification than have to wait \"forever\" for something he wants.  When he gets upset about something, he'll dig in and argue to exhaustion even if he's arguing against what he really wants.\n\nAnyway, a gentle conversation with your wife about her goals, how you can support her decisions, and how to work toward a future together is probably in order.", "Getting the feeling she doesn't want to go because she's changed her mind about dental assistant school.  Seems like she was trying to sabotage that plan so that she could get out of going.  Pretty dramatic way to make sure that didn't happen.  I would take a pause on the school as it may no longer be something she is interested in.", "She doesn\u2019t want to go. And is picking fights with you to make it your fault.", "I think you need some explicit financial agreements. You say you consult for anything over $20. I think you see that as considerate and expect the same in return. Fair enough. But you need to explicitly state so, and she has to agree.\n\nMoreover, I can envision a situation where someone could make a bunch of \"under 20\" purchases over a short span of time, and thus use way more money than one larger-appearing purchase.\n\nMy husband and I inform each other of purchases over $50. We consult but don't veto for things over $100. See, we talk it out and come to a mutual decision if it affects us both. It might be that the person wanting to make a purchase decides not to. Or, that person gives up something else so they can have this thing.\n\nIf you are saving for tuition, it's fair to say to your wife that if she spends $100 like that, that it's going to affect when her tuition is paid. If she is fine with those consequences, it is on her, but it might be a deal breaker for you. My husband has a gambling addiction, for example. We have finances set up so that he doesn't have access to money to gamble online. But if he found a way and spent money on it, the consequence is that I leave. However, it's his choice, in the end, since there's always ways around gambling blocks etc. If he should choose that again, that's my deal breaker. But I can't tell him not to. Hes an adult. I can only tell him i won't stay if he does.", ">I\u2019ve never seen it as my money and her money, it\u2019s OUR money.\n\nHow does she see it? Is your view an actual agreement that\u2019s been discussed, or just something you\u2019ve assumed for the both of you?", "Lots of people have preferences about being with people with tattoos. Personally I\u2019m not for it; I\u2019d find them less attractive. But I wouldn\u2019t be happy when my spouse goes behind my back to get one in such a financial pit. Something like that is huge, and should be consulted. OP could easily have asked for a divorce and whatnot.", "And let's be honest- a $100 tattoo could be reeeeeaaaly ugly.", "True\n\nThough if spending $20 is still enough to get him to have to discuss it the financial situation must be bad and spending $100 after saying they need to save is still a bad move", "Yeah I suppose. \n\nI particularly hate:\n\n>we can go pick one out together and get her a nice one\n\nLike no dude, you do not get to pick someone else's tattoo what kind of paternalistic bs is that", "A tattoo is nowhere near a mastectomy, but the previous person wasn't trying to say they're equivalent. \n\nThe point is they were making is that OP is really upset about his wife's relatively minor alteration to her body, which is a red flag given that OP's wife's body is likely to change over time. A mastectomy is an example of a change that many women go through, sometimes by choice as a preventative measure, and with how OP was responding to his wife getting a tattoo there's a good chance he would respond very negatively to his wife needing a mastectomy.\n\nAnd she very much did run the tattoo by him. He disagreed with her getting it at that point in time but he very much did know she was planning on getting a tattoo. He was fine with it when he thought he would get input on it (saying they could choose one for her together) when it really is her choice and only her choice. \n\nHe's an AH not because he dislikes the tattoo, but because he's continuously expressing it in a way that's incredibly hurtful to his wife. If he was just upset about the money that would be one thing and he wouldn't be an AH, but continuously telling his wife she \"ruined her body\" with an \"ugly thing\" is an AH thing to do, which plays into the other person's point of what if she gains weight or has a mastectomy or needs a permanent feeding tube or there's some other change to her body down the line, is he going to be as cruel to her then as he's being to her now?", "Yes, to an extent, although they really need to settle on a definite amount that each of them is allowed to spend without checking with the other. In my household, it's $200 -- though we often check at lower amounts if the other is right there, we don't have an obligation to. It sounds like he feels that $20 is the right amount, which I think is a bit low, but if they agree on it, then it's fine. \n\nThe key is that for a lot of families, $100 would be okay for one partner to spend without asking the other, and in a lot of other families it wouldn't be. They need to make an explicit decision between them, because right now it's looking as if they have very different assumptions about what's a reasonable amount to spend on one's own.", "Maybe, I seen so real horrible tattoos. I would have a hard time being neutral on. \ud83d\ude1c", "He said it\u2019s important to save money, but not that they have absolutely no spare money. He checks with her when he wants to spend $20 and I highly doubt that\u2019s on groceries.", "It will be ok to spend the money in 3 months when HE can go & pick out HER tattoo TOGETHER, though,  right?", "Probably true. I know people who feel like everyone should talk to each other about $10 even though they've got money, but this family doesn't sound like they're that financially comfortable.", "Why would anybody not want to choose something their partner (who, depending on placement could be looking at it more than they ever do) likes as a permanent body decoration? Do they have to? No. Is it stupid to choose to be less physically attractive to somebody they want to be with? Yes.", "Of course our bodies change. But he has a right to hate her choice of tattoo. He probably could be more tactful, but his wife chose to not get his input on the design.", "It is a lot easier to accept your partner\u2019s appearance changing due to something completely out of control than it is to accept them choosing to disfigure themselves.", "Lol geez I didn't even think of the awfulness that she could have gotten. Here I am thinking she got like some flowers or a little two word phrase tattooed on her. Just to find out she got a dickbutt tattooed on her neck.", "'Want to' and 'believe you have the right to' are vastly different things, and the latter is deeply ew."]}
