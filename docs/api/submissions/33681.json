You have a reasonable expectation to privacy in your room, especially while changing, and the 5 year old is still learning. He\u2019ll get it eventually; however, your bf isn\u2019t helping him by not using the opportunity to explain why this is why we knock before entering a room (would\u2019ve been the perfect teachable moment). He shouldn\u2019t be putting blame on you, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s taking any responsibility whatsoever.", "NTA, it was an innocent moment. People change in bedrooms, which is why it\u2019s important to knock. The kid is 5 and still learning. Your bf should have taken as a moment to gently correct his son.", "NTA. He should teach his son to knock. I\u2019ll assume he\u2019s not a complete jerk and was just caught off guard as you were. Don\u2019t feel bad. His son should also learn that nudity isn\u2019t porn.", "NTA. His son is still young enough to make the no-knocking mistake without really knowing any better, and you\u2019re doing nothing wrong by being naked in your own bedroom behind closed doors after getting out of the shower.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be making you out to be the person that\u2019s in the wrong here.", "Not the asshole.

Little kids don\u2019t care about shit like that and he did come in unannounced", "NTA, but your boyfriend is! There is no excuse for his decision to blame you for this situation. I suggest telling him how it made you feel. He needs to own his behavior and apologize to you. Men whose knee jerk (emphasis on jerk) tendency is to blame their GFs when stressful things happen do not make good partners IMO.  \n\nYou deserve privacy, and a good parent would teach his child that closed bedroom and bathroom doors\n need to be respected. Perhaps you have only recently moved in, in which case your BF may be feeling some guilt? He may have reached the way he did because he's not sure it's OK to have you living with his son. He needs to figure this out without lashing out at you.", "Absolutely NTA. This is gaslighting. I know people use it waaaay too frequently on here, but this is a real case. Instead of being the victim, because you are, you get cast as the villain here. That's not what happened, but your bf's reaction and reinforcement of casting you as the bad guy makes you think you did something wrong when that's not what happened. And because it's so contrary to your experience, you start to doubt yourself and your ability to interpret events. \n\nThat's why you got so upset, I think: gaslighting is a really nasty trick to play on someone because it creates some really fundamental doubts.", "You should have \"reiterated\" teaching his son some manners, and how to knock on a door and wait to be told to come in.

What if my son tells his bio mom and is this going to affect custody? Is he going to remember this and then make things weird later? Damn it. Ahhhh!\n\nHe prob panicked.

He should of advised the child he did wrong bursting in on you.", "Not the asshole at all. Everyone comes from a place of being right.

Your room is also the child\u2019s father\u2019s room?  Would it be reasonable to expect that the kid might barge in?  Does the child live in the house?

Totally reasonable for you to not expect the kid to bust in, but also reasonable for your bf to ask you to try to avoid the situation next time by getting dressed sooner or locking the door. Doesn't mean he's calling you a predator, just trying to avoid an awkward situation!\n\nObviously the kid needs to learn to knock, but it's not as simple as \"just teach the kid to knock\" - it takes time to learn a habit! And even adults forget to knock occasionally. Knocking is just a tough one because it often doesn't end up being necessary, but you have to do it every time anyway just in case. That can be hard to remember, especially as an excitable little kid.\n\nSo, while he works on building that habit, you can help too by getting dressed sooner or locking the door. Sometimes being around little kids means adjusting your own habits to account for their inevitable mistakes.", "NAH, but this is what locks are for.  If you don\u2019t want people walking through a door, there\u2019s a really easy way to prevent it.", "ESH except the kid.\n\nBoyfriend sucks because he should have put more of the responsibility on the child and remind him to knock.
