As far as I can tell your sister definitely has some childhood issues to resolve around feeling good enough or like she's okay taking life at her own pace. Not competing with you and trying to one up you. You have every right to not be that happy about her pregnancy with how she treated you during yours and also the traumatic birth you just went through. I hope you get better soon!", "NTA\n\n> and my sister told my that this was not even close to natural birth \n\nWow, your sister sucks.\n\nI had a traumatic first labour too with my firstborn being admitted to NICU also. Please don't waste energy on your sister. I would send her a generic congratulations and just focus on your child and your own mental health. \n\nBest lesson I ever learnt as a new Mum was to put my mental health first and keep a polite distance with toxic family members so I could be the best Mum possible for my kiddos. I would recommend doing the same. If she's competitive and combative with you - she'll be the same with your child. And even worse when she has her own. Not worth the trouble..be amicable but distance yourself. You have the very valid excuse of recovering from a traumatic labour and getting to know your new little human.\n\nAnd congratulations. I was twenty two when I had my eldest too - and they're eight this year. You're in for the most wonderful journey <3", "NTA: Your feelings are valid. You are also recovering from a traumatic birth and learning the ropes of being a new mom. Blame on your feelings on that if it makes you feel better. It seems like your sister is playing catch up. I wish your  sister  realized that everyone has different time lines in their life. (I admittedly struggle with this and I have talked about my feelings with people I am close to).", "NTA. Honestly though your mom is the Queen AH here. Your sister is a jerk making bad decisions, but your mom emotionally neglected you by making you work things out yourself because you were the \u2018smart one\u2019 and infantilised your sister by telling her she was the \u2018dumb one\u2019. And she continues to enable your sister even now.", "NTA- for your mental health you might want to go low contact with your sister.", "NTA, be prepared for you mom to also favor her child.  This will be from time spent to items bought.  If you have the same gender, they will expect you to hand down clothing.  As for the clothing, look online for a community mothers' group that does clothing exchanges or consignment stores.  Good luck with your little one.", "Info: is this a repeat? This story sounds too familiar.", "NTA, but it sounds like you\u2019re both in competition with each other. Time to let each other live your own lives and not worry about the other. You\u2019ll be much happier.", "INFO: does her husband work?", "Wrong sub.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
