Rob has three kids (15f, 8m, & 6m). His two younger boys are he and his wife's kids, where as his oldest (who I'll call Kat) is from a previous relationship. \n\nKat splits time 50/50 between her mom and Rob. This xmas she'll be with him. Usually Rob&wife+kids, our parents, and myself do a Christmas dinner/gift exchange together but it usually revolves around the younger kiddos nowadays. Rob and Kat's mom are both saving up to buy Kat a vehicle when she starts driving; Kat is aware of this and knows this means less 'big' gifts until then, but I felt kinda bad that all she's not getting that much for xmas.\n\nKat is very into gaming/mods/3d renders & has wanted a nice gaming PC for a while (all she has is an older laptop at the moment). I've got few expenses and a disposable income, so I figured \"what the hell\" and decided to go ahead and buy one for Kat for xmas. I told both Kat's mom and Rob about my idea for it before purchase; they both signed off on the idea. I found a nice prebuilt for around $1700 and ordered it. When I showed Rob the PC, he seemed taken aback and said he didn't realize it was an *ACTUAL* PC and *that* expensive.\n\nRob wants me to give the gift to Kat as from \"Mom, Dad, and Aunt \\[MY NAME\\]\". He's offered to purchase a monitor to include with the PC to make it \"fair\". I told him no, and if he wants to buy a monitor that's great, but a $200 monitor isn't the same as a $1700 PC. Rob isn't happy with this, and says I'm trying to undermine him and make him look bad to Kat.\n\n1) I think thats crazy, I just want to do something cool for my niece.  \n2) why is it bad that I want credit for a gift I researched & purchased on my own?  \n3) wouldn't it be unfair for Kat's mom to ALSO not get credit if Rob does?\n\nRob wants me to either let him and SiL to also claim credit for the gift or wait until her bday (in 8 months!!) to give the PC so he isn't 'overshadowed' by me. My parents say I should just aquiese since Kat is his daughter & its not that big a deal.

He is a bad man, a bad father, and a bad brother.  Do not let this ahole take credit for your gift.  You may need to let your niece know what her dad is trying to pull in case he does tell her it is from him too. What a self centered jerk.  He is putting himself over something his daughter really wants and would bring her and you a lot of happiness. Wow.", "Nta- but have you called Kat's mom to see if she would be willing to help with this issue? Or her thoughts?", "NTA - If their daughter can\u2019t understand why her parents aren\u2019t getting her an expensive gift while saving up for a car for her, then she doesn\u2019t deserve a car. However, it seems like the daughter can comprehend this situation, it\u2019s the parents that think their daughter is stupid? That she\u2019ll actually think her aunt loves her more because of an expensive PC?", "NTA. If someone buys our daughter a gift, no matter the cost we always give them huge thanks. We would never take credit for a gift we didn't get. I'd tell my daughter how lucky she is to have someone who loves her so much.

At 8 and 6 they will notice a difference if their gifts from you are lackluster and they see big sister get a big expensive gift. They don\u2019t understand her other gifts are going to be small because of the car. If you\u2019re spending $1700 on Kat, could you get nephews something flashy like a Switch for $300 or maybe not a gaming system but still something awesome? \n\nYour bro wanting credit for your gift is an AH ask, because you won\u2019t get credit for the car Kat gets.\n\nI think this is ESH unless nephews are getting a decently awesome gift. Favoritism isn\u2019t cool.", "Possibly ESH\n\nTLDR: When potentially upstaging parent(s) with Xmas gift giving, you should be aware of this and be correspondingly tactful/open. Equally they don't have a right to take credit for your generosity.\n\n1. It's wonderful that you're willing to spend this much on your niece, but your brother & mum having signed off the idea does not mean they've signed off in the budget you've gone for. It's hard to know without more context, but if this is an abnormally high amount to spend on gifts within your family then that's an issue.\n2. Absolutely take credit for the research & cost. Also for just the idea in the first place. However be careful that you taking credit doesn't come across as boasting about what you've spent or that you showing your family up for the fact that they can't. This all comes down to the tact with which you've approached this which is not covered in the post.\n3. Having the mum on the gift sounds more reasonable if Rob and her always say gifts are from the both of them. However then it comes down to whether Rob should be on the gift in the first place. Him getting a screen separately and saying that's from him and the mom sounds more reasonable rather than piggy-backing on yours.", "Talking about taking \u201ccredit\u201d for gifts seems very weird to me. Honestly, I agree with your brother that you\u2019re maybe looking forward to the part where you give her a lot more than her parents do. If you were saying \u201cI really want this to be my special gift to her, I was really looking forward to giving it to her,\u201d I might feel differently. But more than once, what you said is that you want \u201ccredit\u201d for the gift.\n\nWhat would it cost you to go in on the gift with them? What will it cost in your relationship with your brother to put your foot down over who gets \u201ccredit\u201d for what\u2019s supposed to be an expression of love? I think your brother thinks you\u2019re eager to outshine him as a gift-giver, and fussing about this makes it seem a little bit like maybe you are. YTA.", "YTA for buying it in the first place. NTA for wanting credit but honestly buying a 15 year old a gift that expensive when you know her parents have established she isn't getting anything \"big\" is a pretty crappy thing to do. It really feels like you're just showing off here, and it's incredibly rude amd more than a little inappropriate. There was never a way for you to give her this PC without making the parents feel shitty. Even if the teenager technically understands why she isn't getting a bigger gift, if you give her this PC all she's really going to remember about this Christmas is you got her a ridiculously expensive computer and her parents didn't. \nI'd return the PC and get her a nice but reasonable Christmas gift.
