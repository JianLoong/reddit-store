Rob has three kids (15f, 8m, & 6m). His two younger boys are he and his wife's kids, where as his oldest (who I'll call Kat) is from a previous relationship. \n\nKat splits time 50/50 between her mom and Rob. This xmas she'll be with him. Usually Rob&wife+kids, our parents, and myself do a Christmas dinner/gift exchange together but it usually revolves around the younger kiddos nowadays. Rob and Kat's mom are both saving up to buy Kat a vehicle when she starts driving; Kat is aware of this and knows this means less 'big' gifts until then, but I felt kinda bad that all she's not getting that much for xmas.\n\nKat is very into gaming/mods/3d renders & has wanted a nice gaming PC for a while (all she has is an older laptop at the moment). I've got few expenses and a disposable income, so I figured \"what the hell\" and decided to go ahead and buy one for Kat for xmas. I told both Kat's mom and Rob about my idea for it before purchase; they both signed off on the idea. I found a nice prebuilt for around $1700 and ordered it. When I showed Rob the PC, he seemed taken aback and said he didn't realize it was an *ACTUAL* PC and *that* expensive.\n\nRob wants me to give the gift to Kat as from \"Mom, Dad, and Aunt \\[MY NAME\\]\". He's offered to purchase a monitor to include with the PC to make it \"fair\". I told him no, and if he wants to buy a monitor that's great, but a $200 monitor isn't the same as a $1700 PC. Rob isn't happy with this, and says I'm trying to undermine him and make him look bad to Kat.\n\n1) I think thats crazy, I just want to do something cool for my niece.  \n2) why is it bad that I want credit for a gift I researched & purchased on my own?  \n3) wouldn't it be unfair for Kat's mom to ALSO not get credit if Rob does?\n\nRob wants me to either let him and SiL to also claim credit for the gift or wait until her bday (in 8 months!!) to give the PC so he isn't 'overshadowed' by me. My parents say I should just aquiese since Kat is his daughter & its not that big a deal.

Equally they don't have a right to take credit for your generosity.\n\n1. It's wonderful that you're willing to spend this much on your niece, but your brother & mum having signed off the idea does not mean they've signed off in the budget you've gone for. It's hard to know without more context, but if this is an abnormally high amount to spend on gifts within your family then that's an issue.\n2. Absolutely take credit for the research & cost. Also for just the idea in the first place. However be careful that you taking credit doesn't come across as boasting about what you've spent or that you showing your family up for the fact that they can't. This all comes down to the tact with which you've approached this which is not covered in the post.\n3. Having the mum on the gift sounds more reasonable if Rob and her always say gifts are from the both of them. However then it comes down to whether Rob should be on the gift in the first place. Him getting a screen separately and saying that's from him and the mom sounds more reasonable rather than piggy-backing on yours.", "Talking about taking \u201ccredit\u201d for gifts seems very weird to me. Honestly, I agree with your brother that you\u2019re maybe looking forward to the part where you give her a lot more than her parents do. If you were saying \u201cI really want this to be my special gift to her, I was really looking forward to giving it to her,\u201d I might feel differently. But more than once, what you said is that you want \u201ccredit\u201d for the gift.\n\nWhat would it cost you to go in on the gift with them? What will it cost in your relationship with your brother to put your foot down over who gets \u201ccredit\u201d for what\u2019s supposed to be an expression of love? I think your brother thinks you\u2019re eager to outshine him as a gift-giver, and fussing about this makes it seem a little bit like maybe you are. YTA.", "YTA for buying it in the first place. NTA for wanting credit but honestly buying a 15 year old a gift that expensive when you know her parents have established she isn't getting anything \"big\" is a pretty crappy thing to do. It really feels like you're just showing off here, and it's incredibly rude amd more than a little inappropriate. There was never a way for you to give her this PC without making the parents feel shitty. Even if the teenager technically understands why she isn't getting a bigger gift, if you give her this PC all she's really going to remember about this Christmas is you got her a ridiculously expensive computer and her parents didn't. \nI'd return the PC and get her a nice but reasonable Christmas gift.

Personally, I wouldn't feel comfortable making that decision FOR a parent. And also it's totally valid for you to not want to \"split\" the gift.\n\nI think this is something that hindsight will probably be 20/20 on. Easier to see when it's less emotionally packed.

Nah buddy. Im petty so I say give the gift whenever you want.", "If you were my kids auntie, and gave them that when we were broke, I would love that you did this. My sister would always get my kids the worst presents - things to old or too young for them. \n\nYou have researched, you have cared and you are the best auntie.\n\nyour brother is TA.", "NTA.  Tell them if he and Mom want credit for the gift tell them to give you their 2/3 share of the $$$.  Otherwise the gift is fully from you, which in that case I'd give her the gift at the ex's home and tell her to keep it there.", "NTA\n\nIf they want to claim equal share, then they pay you back 2 thirds of the cost.\n\nSo rude.", "No, you have done nothing wrong here you bought the gift. why should he have his name on it?", "NTA\n\nTell your brother when he buys Kat a car ,you will be get car seat covers and he has to tell Kat the car is also from you .", "ESH. You bought your own trouble by bragging about your gift. Your brother sucks for not putting up the money for a share, if that\u2019s what he wants.", "\\> Leave only a secret ticket: a special gift will be delivered to you in 10 days.\n\nTreasure hunt!", "I've always been mystified by this. I want my kid to be happy. If someone else helps facilitate that, yay!", "OP THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. NTA btw.", "This is the way to go OP. As someone else said, he might even let the younger siblings mess with her computer. I'd have it set up at her mom's house since she was on board with the PC as well.", "\"by all means, please do it\" is what my brother always says when my family wanted to buy his daughter something. But he's a cheap guy, he's happy because now he doesn't need to buy things, bleh", "Birthday present in advance isn't a bad idea, unless OP is loaded they can still get a birthday present for her birthday and I kinda doubt it will cost (or be able to cost) anything close to 1.7k", "Rob wants to overshadow his ex and use OPs funds to do  it.", "set a admin password, set up bitlocker, install windows updates the whole shebag so when she turns it on it's ready right away. Kinda like how some parent assemble the toys the night before or how my mom would make sure the new toys had batteries. I just thought all toys came with them in them til i was 9", "$1,700 is what laptops cost. I bought mine recently and it was about that much. I guess Rob was expecting OP to buy an old laptop?", "This should be at the tippy top.", "Exactly! My grandparents got me a piano keyboard, and my parents got me a set of books, a microphone that connected to it, and a bench. One year they bought us a Wii, and my parents bought a few games to go with it. Often, my grandparents would just give my mom money to buy a joint present , and the big part would come from them. We\u2019re not struggling anymore, but when we were I was just thrilled to have the things. It didn\u2019t matter to me that grandparents got me the big thing.", "Treating a teenager like a 6 and 8 year old isn't cool either.  \n\nOne year my sister and I both got small black and white TVs for our room from grandma. My mom didn't think it was 'fair' so she put the color living room TV in my 6 year old brothers room.  Showed us exactly where we stood in the pecking order of the family and I remember it 36 years later like it was yesterday. \n\nSo long as uncle gets the other kids something nice at a similar age they shouldn't feel bad about getting a teenager a useful gift like a computer.", "Oh! Maybe a picture printed on a puzzle like the puzzle is the gift", ">I'd imagine most parents would put the  kids' happiness over keeping score\n\nYou reminded me of something! When I was a kid, I had this auntie that always gave me and my siblings the coolest gifts in the family. It wasn't until a couple years ago I found out that those gifts had been purchased by my mother. Turns out mum was worried that my dad (who was abusive in many ways) wouldn't allow her to get us anything so she'd buy stuff in secret, and give it to my auntie to gift to us so dad wouldn't find out. She cared more about us getting the stuff than getting the credit, I'm just sad she had to go to such lengths but it shows how much she loved us.", "I think this is the best way!!", "oh never thought of that tell the brother fine from all of us and the car I'll buy some fuzzy dice and a gas card and you'll say it's from all of us then right? fair compromise? no how come?", "Yep. Does ex even know that Rob is saying this? I would reach out to her and ask her opinion.", "My dad would gift wrap the number of batteries needed in little bundles for each thing that required them XD", "They really should. Replacing toy batteries is expensive as hell.", "A few years back I spent almost 1700 on just a graphics card for my pc. 1700 isn't too bad for a pc these days", "It's a pre-built pc. \n\n500 of the cost is the pre part.", "fuzzy dice and a gas card with $300 on it", "Moms are the best \ud83e\udd72\n\nI hope you are all free of your abusive dad!", "Mom here and that's exactly what I did/do still to this day for anyone I get a gift for", "I spent 2 grand on mine. Fuck that component shortage from 2020......", "Not necessarily. We priced out a PC earlier this year and ended up finding a pre built with the same specs for less. We wanted the fun of building it, but we couldn't pass up a few hundred in savings.", "$1700 for a prebuilt pc means it is an extremely basic pc. If it were fully optimized for gaming you\u2019d be looking anywhere from 3k-5k depending on what storage, ram, processor and graphics card is used. Even $1700 for a normal communal house computer is target range. Your comment seems pretty uninformed"]}
