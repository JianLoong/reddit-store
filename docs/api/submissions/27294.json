You're 15, you've lost your mom and your dad is erasing all traces of her existence. He's allowed to remarry and have a girlfriend, but he's done it all wrong, and he expects you to adapt to his new life like an emotionless robot.\n\nYou're not disrespectful and you're not cold, you're GRIEVING and you need a therapist if you're not already seeing one. Your father would also need a therapist to help him interact better with you and understand you, you're his son and he needs to take your emotions into account, his screams and incomprehension are the last thing you need right now.", "NTA.

A month ago I met my dad's new girlfriend and her 8 year old son, they moved in a week after I met them and they're already talking about getting married early next year.\n\nI'm going to be brutally honest, there is a very strong chance your dad was already seeing her. I wouldn't be surprised if you had similar thoughts so it's perfectly understandable that you're being cold.", "NTA - the fact that he took down every photo of your mom and brought in his new gf so soon might be a sign that he was already cheating on your mom before she passed.   \n\n\nis there other family you can move in with? grandparents or aunts/uncles?", "NTA - x100000.  You lost your mom.  She will always be your mom even though she isn't here.  Your dad is being unfair to you.  While you lost your mom, he lost his wife.  The grief you both have is different.  He doesn't recognize that.  He is only concerned about how he is dealing with his loss and he is showing absolutely no concern for how you are dealing with your loss.\n\nHe and his GF believe they are now your instant family, her son is your instant brother.  That's now how relationships work.  They are being unfair and not respecting your need to grieve and figure out what relationship you want with them.\n\nShe is your dad's GF, and will be his wife.  It highly unlikely that you will form a bond with her as a step mom.  And that is ok.\n\nI would suggest that you need to focus on yourself and your plans for your future.  You are in high school.  You need to start thinking about what you want for a career when you become an adult and what kind of schooling or training you need for that career.  You should think about you are almost driving age and you need to work towards getting that driver's license, etc.\n\nAs for the GF and her son, you are going to need to not be hostile towards them because you still need your dad and he still has the power to punish.  So, i would suggest rather than saying no, ask questions, are they asking you to babysit an 8 year old?  are they expecting you to play catch or entertain him?  That would be babysitting which is their job, not yours.  Also, rather than saying no, be busy.  Be busy with school work or extra curricular activities, be too busy to be home.  Since you are grounded, you are going to have to apologize to get out of being grounded.  apologize and ask your dad to be specific in his expectations of you and be specific in what role he sees his gf who is not you mom or legal guardian having in parenting you?  She asked you to take her son to the park, you said no.  It's no fun for a 15 yr old to play with an 8 yr old.  So of course you wouldn't want to take a little kid to park.  grovel a bit to get him to drop the grounding.  Then get busy being busy doing constructive things that will look good on a resume for college or a job, etc.  If you are busy, you won't have time to play babysitter...", "NTA losing your mom at age 15 is really really hard. You may need therapy to just be able to process this. And then your father throws a new mom and brother in the mix! That\u2019s just not okay. I wish you all the best and I am sending you some motherly love. You are definitely not TA!", "NTA.\n\nYour father is being unreasonable to think that a child - especially one who had a mother with them for 15 years - could just accept this new insta-family. 6 months is such a short time in which to even *try* to process such a loss. Your father went about this in (imho) the worst possible way.", "NTA. Your dad \"probably\" started seeing this woman when your mom was still alive because 5 months is too little time to grieve the death of spouse, move on, date someone and move in with them and their kid, and make wedding plans. The affair made it so easy for him to move on and her death allowed him to officially be with her. They also removed every sign of your mother ever living in the house because it reminded them of the wicked people they are. OP, you take your time grieving the death of your mother, which would've been much easier if these people around you weren't such AHs. Also, it's not your job to take her kid to the park.", "NTA. Your dad was naive at best for thinking this was going to be easy. What\u2019s being asked of you is unfair. Frankly it\u2019s a bit unfair to these new people too. Good luck.

It's heartbreaking to hear of your father's treatment of you. Please reach out to another trusted adult to ask for help with your grief. Best of luck to you.", "NTA, losing a parent is hard. Then to feel like they never mattered hurts, and having those around you try and force you to accept someone as \"family\" while your still grieving is hurtful. It feels like the person you loved and knew was just wiped off the earth and only you cared enough to try and keep their memory alive. You don't owe your dad's girlfriend or her child, anything. Don't be their free babysitter. If you have to \"watch\" or \"take\" her kid some where then they should be paying you per hr. Just keep in mind that your dad also lost his partner of more than fifteen years. So while you're having a difficult time losing someone, you have known your whole life. He is also hurting having a difficult time losing someone he has known your whole life and some. He may not know how to cope alone, hence his quick girlfriend. He may have moved on quickly as well, that doesn't mean you have to forget your mom. You can always keep her alive in your heart and memories.", "NTA. People deal with grief in different ways, or sometimes do things so they don't have to deal with it. I would guess that your dad is trying to push out those feelings of grief by trying to move fast with a new relationship. It's not uncommon, but that doesn't mean you have to understand it either. What bothers me here is that your dad has seemingly no care for *your* feelings, *your* grief. Generally speaking, a kid doesn't just \"move on\" from losing their parent quickly.", "Your Dads being a monster. You dont even get to grieve. I hope those pictures are somewhere you can get them. You deserve to have them in your room if he cant deal with having them in the house. He is replacing her. Its going to be hard to keep a peace, or yourself, in such an openly hostile situation. I wish you all the luck and support you can get until you can safely create your own space. Try your best not to take it out on the kid, but he is NOT your responsibility. You dont work for them.", "I was so sorry to read about your mother.  I think you must still be grieving, and your father probably is as well.  People deal with grief in different ways and removing pictures of your mother may be how your father deals with it. He probably felt sadness every time he saw them, whereas you want to remember your mother.\n\nIt is understandable that you would not welcome your father's new relationship after such a short time and his new gf can certainly never replace your mother.  Did your father discuss with you about his gf moving in?  No one should ever tell you that \"it's time to move on\".  Grief takes as long as it takes.\n\nI think your father is being very insensitive.  New gf has no right to expect you to take responsibility for her son, but it may help you if you try to be kinder to him.  He is only 8 and this situation is not his fault.  You may find that you enjoy being a \"big brother\" figure to him but even if you don't, please don't take out your anger on him.\n\nNTA, and your father and his gf are AHs for not considering your feelings.", "NTA\nEveryone grieves differently but it's not right for your dad to push all this on you. Just because he's ready to move on he should show you the love and respect to grieve and heal.", "NTA\n\nYour father is a total AH for forcing this gf on you so soon after you lost your mother. \n\nHe is wrong for trying to force you to \"move on\" from your mom. Wrong for removing all the pictures of your mother. (Please ask to keep them and see if you can find a relative to hold on to them for you until you have a place of your own).\n\n*He is not respecting the relationship you had with your mother.* \n\nHe should not be screaming at you, or demanding that you play with a child you don't know. He is wrong for pushing his gf as a replacement for your mother.\n\nWith his attitude, I suspect it will be hard for you to communicate with him about your feelings and concerns.\n\nDo you have a relative that you can talk with? Is there a teacher or school counselor who could listen to you? Can you ask someone to tell your father that you need grief counseling and possibly therapy? \n\nI hope so much that there is a good adult you can go to for help and guidance.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry you're being forced into relationships that you neither want nor are ready for. Your father is treating you horribly. Is there anyone from your mom's family you can talk to?", "Honestly, to me it feels like your dad might have been having an affair with this woman before your mom died. He probably waited for her to pass instead of getting a divorce because that would make him look like an AH to divorce his dying sick wife, plus no alimony or child support payments. Figured a month was \"long enough\" grieving time and moved her in. If it wasn't for the fact that the kid was 8yo I would question his parentage. I still might honestly, reddit has taught me that there are plenty of people who have a side family.\n\nNTA. You are not obligated to feel anything for people you barely know.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nIf you can try to see if there are other family members you can stay with. If not my advice is do the bare minimum to make your life easy (pretend going along with the \"family\"), do well in school, get a part time job as soon as possible, save up as much money as you can, and move out as soon as possible.\n\nIt sounds like survival might be easier if you blend in. Remember this is not them winning, it is you creating time for an exit plan. Then go no contact.", "Why not ask the girlfriend how quickly she'd like to be erased from her son's life and replaced, if she passes while he's still a child,  just so you know what the agreed on time limit for loving someone is.", "NTA, but is the kid your half brother by chance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And your dad has to find a way to accept that you're not in the same place that he is regarding your mother's death. \n\nI don't think its helpful to assign \"asshole\" to either party, cause that's just gonna end up making things more combative. \n\nYou both gotta find a way to talk about this without escalating it into an argument.", "I'm really sorry about your mom. \n\nVery soft YTA\n\nOnly because you have no right to expect your dad to grieve the same way you do, on the same timeline, or to grieve at all. Maybe he and your mom had a miserable marriage and hid it from you. Whatever. His feelings are his business, not yours. \n\nBy the same token, your dad is not allowing you to grieve in your way, on your own schedule. What he's doing is much worse, because he has responsibilities to you that he is absolutely neglecting. He should not be erasing your mom from your house. He can date, but he shouldn't be presenting you with a \"new mom.\" Like, ever. Maybe he's doing this out of grief. If he is, the whole thing will eventually fall apart. But that's his business, not yours.\n\nIt sucks being a kid, because you have no power, and people tend to not listen to you. What to do from here:\n\n1. You should be polite and respectful to new gf and her kid.\n2. You can and should draw the line at pretenses of being a big happy family, where you are concerned. You are not obligated to lie. But being civil isn't saying you're happy; it's just saying you're handling yourself well.\n3. You shouldn't be expected to care for the gf's son. But if you don't, you will apparently be grounded. So make your own call there.\n4. Ask for therapy, which your dad should be all for because he says he wants you to move on from your mother's death. And if your dad won't provide it, see what's available at school. The beauty of this approach is that the therapist will probably conclude very quickly that you and Dad need therapy together. And in a therapist's office, he'll have to listen to you, without gf around, and you'll have backup from an authority figure.\n\nGood luck. Make sure you have a picture of your mom in your room. At least on your phone.", "NAH\n\n6 month is not a long time to get over the death of a parent. Eventually you will have to learn to live with your new stepmom and stepbrother.

Otherwise any family who you can spend talk to or spend time with - grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc? \n\nUnfortunately your dad is TA and you won\u2019t get him to understand. He is putting his (sexual) needs before you. New gf is insensitive clearly so also TA\n\nReality is you have at least 3 years before you can leave so you need to plan accordingly.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard that must be especially at 15. Try to ask your dad if you all can go to family therapy together to try and make it work so you at least feel seen and heard in this new situation.

There is no time limit. Grief is personal. Nobody can tell you how, when, and where or for how long you should grieve. Your dad is basically telling you to get over it and move on because he did. I feel like 6 months is fast, but that's telling him how to grieve. You don't have to let go. Him removing any sign of your mother is very disrespectful to you and her memory.

You need time to grieve, and erasing your mom from the house isn\u2019t appropriate.  It\u2019s also not appropriate to force a family upon you.  I have a weird family structure, but it took time and wasn\u2019t forced.  You build relationships, not command them.\n\nI\u2019ll also say\u2026 it\u2019s an awful decision on how fast their moving\u2026 6 months\u2026 moving in and planning a marriage\u2026 forcing your kid to live with a stranger with only a weeks notice\u2026\n\nBad decisions above.", "Nta\n\nIf this was me (the smart-ass/petty person that I am) I would have told him \"Just because you can't feel anything and move on quickly doesn't mean that I have to do the same. You chose her, not me. You have tried to erase MY MOM physically, that doesn't mean I won't remember her. That woman you are with is not my mom, her child is not my brother no matter how hard you try to force me otherwise.\" I might even follow up with this question \"Are you erasing my mom physically because you cheated on her with your new gf?\" Then stare him down! \n\n\nBut that's me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, your dad is making a huge mistake and being very selfish.", "NTA! Do you have any other relatives you can live with?", "I am so sorry. You are not required to support his choices nor are you required to create a relationship with SM or her son. \n\nFirst things first, when your dad is gone, go through and find everything of your moms and take it to someone else\u2019s house and have it stored there. Her jewelry she loved, all photos, recipe books, anything else that you would want to keep and give it to your moms side of the family to hold on to. It seems like he is trying to eraser her and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s stemming from him or his new GF. \n\nSecond, your dad can ground you but I would get involved in every activity at school so it\u2019s a legit excuse why you aren\u2019t home often and it will help with college applications so you can leave him behind. You can tell your dad that he can do what he wants and doesn\u2019t need your support as he is the dad. YOU are the son and if you need support, he should be the one stepping up for you. \n\nThird, if it starts getting worse, record conversations and have video anytime you interact with your dad or his GF. At some point if you need to leave the home still under 18, you have documentation on how he speaks with you, what he does to you, etc. \n\nFourth, go talk asap to your school counselor. They might not have the background to help you but ask them for a recommendation for a free therapist if they cannot help. You need to process the loss of your mom and the changed man your dad is with a professional. \n\nI am so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You have to be in a very difficult situation and it sounds like your dad was moving on from your mom way too quickly. Just know that it sucks and it will be difficult but you will move on and get to a better place in life. This situation (even though you\u2019re not 18 for 3 years) is only temporary. Be the young man your mom would be proud of and continue to grow and educate yourself. Your dad can ground you, take a car or phone away, but he will NEVER be able to take away your education or the memories of your mom. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA  Your dad is a monster.  The fact he can call himself a parent is laughable and a disgrace.  It's men like him the solidify my belief that men can't feel.", "NTA.", "NTA but the problem here really is your dad, not necessarily his gf/son. He's removed your mother from your home, and he's basically telling you to remove her from your heart as well. You are *rightfully* rebelling against this because your mother was important, you love her, and you're not okay with her being erased.", "thank you sm. My dad doesn't really believe in therapy though I don't really know why", "yeah I do but I don't think my dad would let me stay there it'd probably make him angrier if I asked", "I can. He had already moved on, just not legally.", "This is possibly how he is grieving. He possibly doesn\u2019t want to be alone and this was the first person he found.", "yeahh tbh I was kinda worried someone would say that I've been thinking it I just really hope it wasn't true", "And that\u2019s probably his son", "maybe I really hope he wasn't though.\n\nI do but I don't think my dad would let me", "It is also a how some people grieve. My brother emptied Mom's closet like a week or two after she died. Also, men are much more likely to find a new GF when a partner passes than women, and they do it sooner as well because they don't want to take on all the childcare and household work that their spouse was dealing with.", "okay thank you so much dude. I don't know what they expect me to do with her kid they've asked me to look after him when they go out which I didn't because I was already going somewhere so idk if they expect to babysit him in future but I'll probably just do what you said and be busy so I don't have to lmao", "thank you <33", "I honestly did think he might've cheated on my mom but I tried not to think about it because that would be so fucked and I just don't understand how he could do that if he did. \n\nthanks man <3", "Another possible scenario is that he just doesn\u2019t know how to do all the things mom did, so he moves quickly to replace the \u201cwoman\u201d.  Hopefully she understands that he\u2019s going to have very specific expectations as to what the woman \u201cdoes\u201d.  She will one day realize his views are very sexist.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon for dad to, he needs time to let go and start over, not try to continue with a new woman.  He needs therapy to understand new vs continuation.", "thank you, I will", "thank you and that's literally how I feel lol. I'll keep that in mind about my dad ty", "thank you. And yeah I did hide some of her stuff and pictures in my room but I don't know what he did with the rest", "thank you\n\nWe didn't talk about them moving in my dad just came home with them and said they were moving in and that was it. I'm trying not to take it out on the kid, I've not been mean to him I'm just ignoring him he's way too loud and hyper lol", "I'm probably gonna try and speak to the school counselor (if there is one at my school I think there is though) like a few other people suggested. Thank you", "there is but I haven't really spoken to any of them since the funeral", "okay thank you so much.\n\nand yeah no idea if my dad was cheating on my mom a few people did say he might've but I don't really wanna think about it", "no idea I hope not though", "Gotta admit that was my first--and second-- thought.", "okay thank you so much", "The kid is 15, dad needs to let the kid grieve in his own way and not force so much on him so quickly.

His mother died only 6 months ago. Grief takes time. And actually, his father\u2019s first priority - yes, above his own \u2018happiness\u2019 - should be making sure that his son feels safe & has the support he needs as he grieves for his mother. I\u2019m much older than OP, but I\u2019m still finding my feet after my dad\u2019s death\u2026 not the same as I would\u2019ve at 15, but only someone who has never experienced significant loss would say this to a grieving teenager.", "have you ever had a parent die and then have your other parent starting a new family just months later?? you think OP should just accept it and move on quick because that\u2019s what her father did?", "yeah fair I get that just wish he didn't take all her stuff time it's like she never existed and it's only been 6 months mann :/", "Yeah I can\u2019t imagine how this would go down differently. This kid\u2019s world was turned upside-down and then 5 months later the dad decided to do it again? And all the pictures were removed immediately? I\u2019m no therapist but that sounds more like a band aid than a solution. I\u2019m also wondering what kind of other woman would be ok with this? I had a friend who\u2019s dad quickly moved his mistress into their home after my friend\u2019s mom died, and it looked pretty much like this. I\u2019m NOT saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, but it\u2019s likely to have crossed this kid\u2019s mind as well. Which is that much more confusing for anyone in this situation.", "No, you\u2019re the AH. Grow a heart, it will do you good.", "It's not childish or disrespectful for a 16 year old not to have much to say to a new woman and kid being shoved into his home and life 6 months after he lost his mom. And I get the feeling that dad really wasn't grieving all that much...", "This comment is gross and delusional.", "thank you, yeah a few people mentioned speaking to the school counselor I'm gonna see if my school has one and I'll probably talk to them if we have one. I am gonna spend more time away from home (once I'm not grounded) because I don't wanna make them more annoyed at me", "thank you sm.\n\nMy dad doesn't believe in therapy otherwise I would ask thank you though", "yeah, I've mainly been staying at my friends place though just so I don't have to be around them", "I'm pretty sure their marriage was good they had arguments sometimes but thats normal but idk", "Is there another trusted adult you can talk to about this who might be able to advocate for you with your dad? A teacher, clergy person, or other family member?", "Talk to a school counselor and see if your school offers any real therapeutic services. In many states, you\u2019re above the age to consent to your own care. Where I live, the school districts contract with outside agencies and a licensed therapist goes to the school for appointments with the kids. Some schools have divorce/grief/family issues group therapy too.", "Were you able to save anything belonging to your mom? If you did, keep them somewhere safe, away from your father. He may use those items against you to hurt you. He doesn't sound like he's above doing that. If you're in touch with your mom's side of the family or if you have friends, move those items to them now and collect them once you turn 18 and have a place to keep them.

Sorry OP this is rough, you are completely justified feeling the way you do.", "Because therapy will expose truths about himself", "he's going to be angry either way. it will be better for you in the long run to get out of that environment. do what's best for YOU, its okay to put yourself first.", "You do need to reach out to someone, though. Your dad is being pretty unreasonable here.", "You're old enough now that if you want to live with other family, a judge isn't going to stop you.

Join clubs, extracurriculars, shoot even find volunteer hours. Anything that'll keep you busy and not available\n\nEdit to add in: I'm a mom, if my husband did what your dad is doing, I would haunt the every living crap of out him. You deserve better", "Thats cruel. She is your mother. You have more of a right to those memories and photos then anyone else. I am sorry and fully sympathetic. Stay as strong as humanly possible.", "Is there any way to get in touch with them and ask them for pictures or other memories of your mom? I think it would be helpful to connect with people who loved your mom too.", "It's understandable you wouldn't want to think about it, I wouldn't either. \n\nHowever I'm also a cat and the curiosity would get to me. If that ends up happening wait until you're ready to leave.

A side benefit is that it might help you get scholarships to college if you plan to go.
