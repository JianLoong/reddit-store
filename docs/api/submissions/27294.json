You're 15, you've lost your mom and your dad is erasing all traces of her existence. He's allowed to remarry and have a girlfriend, but he's done it all wrong, and he expects you to adapt to his new life like an emotionless robot.\n\nYou're not disrespectful and you're not cold, you're GRIEVING and you need a therapist if you're not already seeing one. Your father would also need a therapist to help him interact better with you and understand you, you're his son and he needs to take your emotions into account, his screams and incomprehension are the last thing you need right now.", "NTA.

A month ago I met my dad's new girlfriend and her 8 year old son, they moved in a week after I met them and they're already talking about getting married early next year.\n\nI'm going to be brutally honest, there is a very strong chance your dad was already seeing her. I wouldn't be surprised if you had similar thoughts so it's perfectly understandable that you're being cold.", "NTA - the fact that he took down every photo of your mom and brought in his new gf so soon might be a sign that he was already cheating on your mom before she passed.   \n\n\nis there other family you can move in with? grandparents or aunts/uncles?", "NTA - x100000.  You lost your mom.  She will always be your mom even though she isn't here.  Your dad is being unfair to you.  While you lost your mom, he lost his wife.  The grief you both have is different.  He doesn't recognize that.  He is only concerned about how he is dealing with his loss and he is showing absolutely no concern for how you are dealing with your loss.\n\nHe and his GF believe they are now your instant family, her son is your instant brother.  That's now how relationships work.  They are being unfair and not respecting your need to grieve and figure out what relationship you want with them.\n\nShe is your dad's GF, and will be his wife.  It highly unlikely that you will form a bond with her as a step mom.  And that is ok.\n\nI would suggest that you need to focus on yourself and your plans for your future.  You are in high school.  You need to start thinking about what you want for a career when you become an adult and what kind of schooling or training you need for that career.  You should think about you are almost driving age and you need to work towards getting that driver's license, etc.\n\nAs for the GF and her son, you are going to need to not be hostile towards them because you still need your dad and he still has the power to punish.  So, i would suggest rather than saying no, ask questions, are they asking you to babysit an 8 year old?  are they expecting you to play catch or entertain him?  That would be babysitting which is their job, not yours.  Also, rather than saying no, be busy.  Be busy with school work or extra curricular activities, be too busy to be home.  Since you are grounded, you are going to have to apologize to get out of being grounded.  apologize and ask your dad to be specific in his expectations of you and be specific in what role he sees his gf who is not you mom or legal guardian having in parenting you?  She asked you to take her son to the park, you said no.  It's no fun for a 15 yr old to play with an 8 yr old.  So of course you wouldn't want to take a little kid to park.  grovel a bit to get him to drop the grounding.  Then get busy being busy doing constructive things that will look good on a resume for college or a job, etc.  If you are busy, you won't have time to play babysitter...", "NTA losing your mom at age 15 is really really hard. You may need therapy to just be able to process this. And then your father throws a new mom and brother in the mix! That\u2019s just not okay. I wish you all the best and I am sending you some motherly love. You are definitely not TA!", "NTA.\n\nYour father is being unreasonable to think that a child - especially one who had a mother with them for 15 years - could just accept this new insta-family. 6 months is such a short time in which to even *try* to process such a loss. Your father went about this in (imho) the worst possible way.", "NTA. Your dad \"probably\" started seeing this woman when your mom was still alive because 5 months is too little time to grieve the death of spouse, move on, date someone and move in with them and their kid, and make wedding plans. The affair made it so easy for him to move on and her death allowed him to officially be with her. They also removed every sign of your mother ever living in the house because it reminded them of the wicked people they are. OP, you take your time grieving the death of your mother, which would've been much easier if these people around you weren't such AHs. Also, it's not your job to take her kid to the park.", "NTA. Your dad was naive at best for thinking this was going to be easy. What\u2019s being asked of you is unfair. Frankly it\u2019s a bit unfair to these new people too. Good luck.

It's heartbreaking to hear of your father's treatment of you. Please reach out to another trusted adult to ask for help with your grief. Best of luck to you.", "NTA, losing a parent is hard. Then to feel like they never mattered hurts, and having those around you try and force you to accept someone as \"family\" while your still grieving is hurtful. It feels like the person you loved and knew was just wiped off the earth and only you cared enough to try and keep their memory alive. You don't owe your dad's girlfriend or her child, anything. Don't be their free babysitter. If you have to \"watch\" or \"take\" her kid some where then they should be paying you per hr. Just keep in mind that your dad also lost his partner of more than fifteen years. So while you're having a difficult time losing someone, you have known your whole life. He is also hurting having a difficult time losing someone he has known your whole life and some. He may not know how to cope alone, hence his quick girlfriend. He may have moved on quickly as well, that doesn't mean you have to forget your mom. You can always keep her alive in your heart and memories.", "NTA. People deal with grief in different ways, or sometimes do things so they don't have to deal with it. I would guess that your dad is trying to push out those feelings of grief by trying to move fast with a new relationship. It's not uncommon, but that doesn't mean you have to understand it either. What bothers me here is that your dad has seemingly no care for *your* feelings, *your* grief. Generally speaking, a kid doesn't just \"move on\" from losing their parent quickly.", "Your Dads being a monster. You dont even get to grieve. I hope those pictures are somewhere you can get them. You deserve to have them in your room if he cant deal with having them in the house. He is replacing her. Its going to be hard to keep a peace, or yourself, in such an openly hostile situation. I wish you all the luck and support you can get until you can safely create your own space. Try your best not to take it out on the kid, but he is NOT your responsibility. You dont work for them.", "I was so sorry to read about your mother.  I think you must still be grieving, and your father probably is as well.  People deal with grief in different ways and removing pictures of your mother may be how your father deals with it. He probably felt sadness every time he saw them, whereas you want to remember your mother.\n\nIt is understandable that you would not welcome your father's new relationship after such a short time and his new gf can certainly never replace your mother.  Did your father discuss with you about his gf moving in?  No one should ever tell you that \"it's time to move on\".  Grief takes as long as it takes.\n\nI think your father is being very insensitive.  New gf has no right to expect you to take responsibility for her son, but it may help you if you try to be kinder to him.  He is only 8 and this situation is not his fault.  You may find that you enjoy being a \"big brother\" figure to him but even if you don't, please don't take out your anger on him.\n\nNTA, and your father and his gf are AHs for not considering your feelings.", "NTA\nEveryone grieves differently but it's not right for your dad to push all this on you. Just because he's ready to move on he should show you the love and respect to grieve and heal.", "NTA\n\nYour father is a total AH for forcing this gf on you so soon after you lost your mother. \n\nHe is wrong for trying to force you to \"move on\" from your mom. Wrong for removing all the pictures of your mother. (Please ask to keep them and see if you can find a relative to hold on to them for you until you have a place of your own).\n\n*He is not respecting the relationship you had with your mother.* \n\nHe should not be screaming at you, or demanding that you play with a child you don't know. He is wrong for pushing his gf as a replacement for your mother.\n\nWith his attitude, I suspect it will be hard for you to communicate with him about your feelings and concerns.\n\nDo you have a relative that you can talk with? Is there a teacher or school counselor who could listen to you? Can you ask someone to tell your father that you need grief counseling and possibly therapy? \n\nI hope so much that there is a good adult you can go to for help and guidance.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry you're being forced into relationships that you neither want nor are ready for. Your father is treating you horribly. Is there anyone from your mom's family you can talk to?", "Honestly, to me it feels like your dad might have been having an affair with this woman before your mom died. He probably waited for her to pass instead of getting a divorce because that would make him look like an AH to divorce his dying sick wife, plus no alimony or child support payments. Figured a month was \"long enough\" grieving time and moved her in. If it wasn't for the fact that the kid was 8yo I would question his parentage. I still might honestly, reddit has taught me that there are plenty of people who have a side family.\n\nNTA. You are not obligated to feel anything for people you barely know.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nIf you can try to see if there are other family members you can stay with. If not my advice is do the bare minimum to make your life easy (pretend going along with the \"family\"), do well in school, get a part time job as soon as possible, save up as much money as you can, and move out as soon as possible.\n\nIt sounds like survival might be easier if you blend in. Remember this is not them winning, it is you creating time for an exit plan. Then go no contact.", "Why not ask the girlfriend how quickly she'd like to be erased from her son's life and replaced, if she passes while he's still a child,  just so you know what the agreed on time limit for loving someone is.", "NTA, but is the kid your half brother by chance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And your dad has to find a way to accept that you're not in the same place that he is regarding your mother's death. \n\nI don't think its helpful to assign \"asshole\" to either party, cause that's just gonna end up making things more combative. \n\nYou both gotta find a way to talk about this without escalating it into an argument.", "I'm really sorry about your mom. \n\nVery soft YTA\n\nOnly because you have no right to expect your dad to grieve the same way you do, on the same timeline, or to grieve at all. Maybe he and your mom had a miserable marriage and hid it from you. Whatever. His feelings are his business, not yours. \n\nBy the same token, your dad is not allowing you to grieve in your way, on your own schedule. What he's doing is much worse, because he has responsibilities to you that he is absolutely neglecting. He should not be erasing your mom from your house. He can date, but he shouldn't be presenting you with a \"new mom.\" Like, ever. Maybe he's doing this out of grief. If he is, the whole thing will eventually fall apart. But that's his business, not yours.\n\nIt sucks being a kid, because you have no power, and people tend to not listen to you. What to do from here:\n\n1. You should be polite and respectful to new gf and her kid.\n2. You can and should draw the line at pretenses of being a big happy family, where you are concerned. You are not obligated to lie. But being civil isn't saying you're happy; it's just saying you're handling yourself well.\n3. You shouldn't be expected to care for the gf's son. But if you don't, you will apparently be grounded. So make your own call there.\n4. Ask for therapy, which your dad should be all for because he says he wants you to move on from your mother's death. And if your dad won't provide it, see what's available at school. The beauty of this approach is that the therapist will probably conclude very quickly that you and Dad need therapy together. And in a therapist's office, he'll have to listen to you, without gf around, and you'll have backup from an authority figure.\n\nGood luck. Make sure you have a picture of your mom in your room. At least on your phone.", "NAH\n\n6 month is not a long time to get over the death of a parent. Eventually you will have to learn to live with your new stepmom and stepbrother.

Otherwise any family who you can spend talk to or spend time with - grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc? \n\nUnfortunately your dad is TA and you won\u2019t get him to understand. He is putting his (sexual) needs before you. New gf is insensitive clearly so also TA\n\nReality is you have at least 3 years before you can leave so you need to plan accordingly.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard that must be especially at 15. Try to ask your dad if you all can go to family therapy together to try and make it work so you at least feel seen and heard in this new situation.

There is no time limit. Grief is personal. Nobody can tell you how, when, and where or for how long you should grieve. Your dad is basically telling you to get over it and move on because he did. I feel like 6 months is fast, but that's telling him how to grieve. You don't have to let go. Him removing any sign of your mother is very disrespectful to you and her memory.

You need time to grieve, and erasing your mom from the house isn\u2019t appropriate.  It\u2019s also not appropriate to force a family upon you.  I have a weird family structure, but it took time and wasn\u2019t forced.  You build relationships, not command them.\n\nI\u2019ll also say\u2026 it\u2019s an awful decision on how fast their moving\u2026 6 months\u2026 moving in and planning a marriage\u2026 forcing your kid to live with a stranger with only a weeks notice\u2026\n\nBad decisions above.", "Nta\n\nIf this was me (the smart-ass/petty person that I am) I would have told him \"Just because you can't feel anything and move on quickly doesn't mean that I have to do the same. You chose her, not me. You have tried to erase MY MOM physically, that doesn't mean I won't remember her. That woman you are with is not my mom, her child is not my brother no matter how hard you try to force me otherwise.\" I might even follow up with this question \"Are you erasing my mom physically because you cheated on her with your new gf?\" Then stare him down! \n\n\nBut that's me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, your dad is making a huge mistake and being very selfish.", "NTA!

Her jewelry she loved, all photos, recipe books, anything else that you would want to keep and give it to your moms side of the family to hold on to. It seems like he is trying to eraser her and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s stemming from him or his new GF. \n\nSecond, your dad can ground you but I would get involved in every activity at school so it\u2019s a legit excuse why you aren\u2019t home often and it will help with college applications so you can leave him behind. You can tell your dad that he can do what he wants and doesn\u2019t need your support as he is the dad. YOU are the son and if you need support, he should be the one stepping up for you. \n\nThird, if it starts getting worse, record conversations and have video anytime you interact with your dad or his GF. At some point if you need to leave the home still under 18, you have documentation on how he speaks with you, what he does to you, etc. \n\nFourth, go talk asap to your school counselor. They might not have the background to help you but ask them for a recommendation for a free therapist if they cannot help. You need to process the loss of your mom and the changed man your dad is with a professional. \n\nI am so sorry you\u2019re going through this. You have to be in a very difficult situation and it sounds like your dad was moving on from your mom way too quickly. Just know that it sucks and it will be difficult but you will move on and get to a better place in life. This situation (even though you\u2019re not 18 for 3 years) is only temporary.

We\u2019re your parents together with your mother passed? \n\nI do have some advice, you need to save some of her things that hold sentimental meaning to you and any photos and have someone store them away from your house like at a friends or trusted family member, someone on your mothers side would be best. If he took photos down that fast, it\u2019s just a matter of time before he starts throwing things out. If he is already yelling at you because of his GF, it may not take long for things to deteriorate further.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "I am so sorry for your loss. It must be very raw for you after only 6 months.\n\nNTA. Your Father expects you to respect a relationship that your aren't a part of. He wants you to play happy families with people you don't even know while you are still grieving the loss of your Mother.\n\nYour Father and his girlfriend are insensitive at best and downright cruel at worst. \n\nDo you have aunts/uncles/family friends that you can't talk to about this? Do you have access to counselling through school? These could be options that might give you a healthy outlet for the pain you are going through.\n\nYour father sounds like a moron to be fair. His first priority for now should be you.", "I would put all the pictures of your mom in a scrapbook. Also make digital copies and if you can have a friend store them on the cloud for you as an extra backup. \n\nTell your dad that just because he can move on a month later does not mean you can. That you need help dealing with your grief. Tell him at this point you are old enough to never see them as family. Honestly I\u2019m wondering if he was having an affair with her before your mom died. Either way I think they are both bad parents for moving in together so quickly. I can\u2019t imagine it is good for her son\u2019s emotional health either.", "Dang. NTA. \nDad must have had this one on stand by. That is all too fast. \n\nParticularly when he has kids (her too)", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Since your dad doesn't seem to be able to communicate, I'd agree with others and maybe move in with your mom's family for a while if possible.\n\nAlso, and eventhough it's not as important, I want to point out, even in any other situation, you're in no way obligated to take the child to the park.", "NTA. No you should have told him to go fuk himself and screamed right back in his gf's face but ten times louder. Don't put up with any shit from some random lady your dad is smashing. She is literally no one, I'd have her scared to even look my way.  And if he's taken down all the pics of your mom so soon after her death,  he isn't even a real parent, more like a sperm donor. Stop treating trashy people with respect they don't deserve.  He grounds you, you ignore him and go wherever you want, whenever you want. He takes your phone, he \"loses\" his wallet. He takes your door, his TV miraculously \"breaks\". If he wants a war, give it to him. Unless he can stay home 24/7 and play police he has absolutely no control over you. Make that very clear to him and sooner than later he will learn how to back the F off. Most fake \"parents\" will buckle when shit escalates to the point where their whole house is in chaos.", "I\u2019d seek out new guardianship if you can. The guardian can also seek child support from your dad.", "Nta, my dad dated after the divorce when I was about your age, I was mean to her for years,  we joke about it sometimes.\nYour dad sounds like he was already cheating,  screw him and screw that new lady, be as mean (non violent) as you want and still nta", "First my deepest condolences for your loss. May your mother's memory be a comfort and a blessing. \n\nI'm so sorry that your dad isn't going through this early process of grieving with you. \n\nGiving your dad the benefit of the doubt, and from reading your responses to other comments - it sounds like your mother's death was more on the sudden side and unexpected - rather than something long term or known to be coming. Therefore, everyone involved was unprepared for the loss. \n\nThis leads me to think your dad took the pictures down because it was painful for him and it was a way for him to cope with his loss. And that obviously he was not at all thinking about how that looks or affects you. \n\nIt also makes me think he wasn't cheating. It is very common for (some) widowers to take a new partner seemingly quickly. Part of the coping. Not able to be alone. Again only thinking about his dealing with loss, absolutely no concern or consideration for yours. It's not right. \n\nHave you and your dad ever talked about the loss of your mom? Is it something you two can have a conversation about? Can you share that you are grieving differently? I agree with others, talking to your counselor is a good idea. Maybe the school counselor can help facilitate the conversation even without provoking anger- so that your dad will really listen and understand where you are coming from. \n\nI hope you and your dad are able to reconcile. Good luck.", "NTA. fuck your dad. say something to the effect of this; \u201cdad, i\u2019m not trying to disrespect your relationship or get in the way of it. i understand that this is how our family is now. but my mother just died. i love my mother. she gave birth to me. i\u2019m a young man and it\u2019s hasn\u2019t even been a year. please respect my grief. please give me time. i deserve it and i need it.\u201d", "Nta, maybe you should ask someone else in your family to live with (grandparents, aunt/uncle)", "NTA I do have a question to ask, do you have maternal grandparents you could go live with for a big maybe? Hell, even paternal grandparents, just some how get out of the house for a bit to grieve in peace.", "NTA. You probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but he was probably seeing her before your mom died. 5 months after she dies and you meet his new girlfriend? No loving husband would even be going on a date 5 months after his wife died, and no loving father would introduce a new girlfriend to his son within weeks of starting to date someone new. Makes me think he\u2019s actually been with her for months and thought 5 months was enough time after your mom\u2019s death for you to meet her.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not required to make an effort. I feel like... what's his deal? If my partner died now, I don't think I would date for long - and having a new wife moving in after six months? \n\nIs the kid his?\n\nWhat is going on here? Why are people so completely moronic when it comes to stuff like this?\n\nI am not judging him for wanting a partner and moving on, we're all different, but he can't expect you to do so. \n\nWeird stuff.", ">he expects you to adapt to his new life like an emotionless robot.\n\nAND play free babysitter - the AUDACITY.  \n\n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your mum OP. How heartbreaking that your father has neglected you emotionally like this. Please speak to the school counsellor and don't hold back information.  \n\n\nDo you have grandparents or anyone you can stay with for a bit?", "Depends strongly on how OP's Mom died. If she has been very sick for a while he might have accepted that she will die for a much longer time.", ">And the new gf is really getting off on the wrong foot with you, I can't see it getting much better.\n\nBased off what OP said, she definitely sounds sketch. \n\nSadly, I don't expect anything good from her going forward.", "She went into the hospital two weeks before she died but we didn't think she was gonna die till the last few days. And I think their relationship was good but I don't really know", "thank you, will do", "I think not taking a year to get things in proper order after your wife and mother of your child dies is an asshole thing to do.", "Dad has abandoned his son.

It is Dad's responsibility to comfort his son.", "Gf\u2019s kid isn\u2019t his dog he needs to walk to the park tho. OP is 15, grieving, and deserves happiness too. Dad disrespected OP first by dumping new \u201cfamily members\u201d on him without notice, getting rid of moms things, and expecting him to play big brother and babysitter to strangers.  How are they being fair to him? Dad literally said he needs to move on from his mom. Why should he respect them as family when they don\u2019t respect him or his mother? \n\nMaybe dad is acting irrationally because of grief but that still doesn\u2019t make it fair to disregard your kids feelings like that.", "i know everyone is already telling you this, but look in the fucking mirror. dad can get another wife, and oh look\u2026 he\u2019s more than happy to do so! this kid CANNOT get another mom and he will not. nobody can. he is 15. he\u2019s got a cool decade before his brain develops. he literally learned to wipe his own ass properly less than a decade ago, hit puberty like two years ago, (not insults, just pointing out the validity of why 15 year olds are not grown adults and should not be expected to behave like them as they\u2019re literally just beginning life) and you expect him to just get over one of the most universally earth-shattering experiences any human can go through? scientifically ignorant of you. grown ass adults grieve over losing a parent for years, or forever. this is a child. his mother has not even been gone for a year. don\u2019t tell him to grow up when he\u2019s not grown; leave being grown to the grown ups. are you even human?", "thank you <3", "thanks man and I'm sorry that happened to you", "thank you <3", "Your dad doesn't believe in therapy because he knows it's an opportunity for someone to tell him he's wrong, directly to his kid. He isn't looking for someone to assist his kid, he knows a therapist isn't going to push his kid to give into his dad's 'happy family' delusion. All he sees is his kid not making things 'easier' on dad to pretend he isn't trying to erase his first wife.", "Yeah NTA dude. Your dad is being an ass and both of you should be in therapy. Tell your school counselor about it if he won't take you to see someone. \n\nAlso your dad's gf as an asshole.\n\nWorst case scenario, you bide your time for 3 years and wash your hands of the lot of them.\n\nDo you know your mom's parents?

I just see no other explanation.\n\nJust get him back in his elder years by not pitching in to his retirement living/ housing. Tell him the 7 yr old will take care of it.

You are 15 you should have a say in where you live.", "Look at the way he's treating the memory of your mother, it's very likely you're next on the chopping block, once you're 18 be prepared for him to cut you off completely.", "Screw his feelings. Talk to the school counselor and talk to your other family. Try to get out of there. It will only get worse.", "I know this is reddit, but sometimes people do, in fact, try to fuck the grief away. Not everyone is cheating", "This is how Dad is *avoiding* his grief - if he's grieving at all.", "I agree with this and came here to say the same. My dad did something similar after my stepmom died (married for nearly 30 years). He was devastated and just couldn\u2019t cope alone. New gf moved in about 6 months later. They were totally incompatible and eventually broke up. I could imagine that being even worse when you\u2019re also parenting a teenager (my dad couldn\u2019t even look after a dog on his own). OP is NTA but I\u2019m hesitant to say the father is one, as awful as his behavior might be.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about this situation OP, it\u2019s really unfair all around.
