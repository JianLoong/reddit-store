They're in school so I send them to class with invites. First party with their classmates (pre k!) and after COVID I'm hosting alongside my husband/ their father. \n\nOne of their classmates moms text me that her daughter is coming. However, her text didn't say an adult was also included. When I asked her to clarify, she said just her daughter. \n\nI asked her if her daughter would be accompanied by an adult, and she responded with - \"We will be coming from church, and I also have an infant to take care of, so I wanted to leave her with you if that's ok. Her sister might be joining her, but has told me she is getting tired of accompanying her sister to birthday parties of kids younger than she is.\"\n\nFirst off, her mom didn't ask. She just assumed that I was going to watch her kid? I'm hosting the dang party and that's stressful enough even when things go smoothly. \n\nOr was she expecting my friends to watch her daughter? Who mostly have kids of their own to watch?\n\nI haven't met this person before. I don't know her child well either. I volunteered at the kids school a handful of times to help with parties and reading, but I couldn't recall their classmate. \n\nI sent her a text, saying \"Sorry, but my husband and I will be too busy hosting the party to watch her.

Why try to get me or other adults to watch your kid for 3 hours?\n\nIs it normal for people to think that young children's parties are just free babysitting for a couple of hours?

I just always thought it was assumed that an adult would be by default with the invited kid? But this incident is making me think to include \"must be accompanied by an adult at all times\" in future party invites. \n\nAlso this party is inviting a lot of military kids. I've noticed that the whole \"Please watch our children because we don't have family nearby\" mentality is super strong. I work full time, and don't have time to watch children even if you paid me. \n\nI'll still invite this classmate if she's accompanied by an adult, but this whole incident just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It makes sense that she would think you only invite enough children that you can handle to keep safe at the party.", "I have 10 year olds.

The only time I ever see a parent staying with their school aged child at a party is when they're the weird, helicopter parent that every other mom avoids.", "When I was growing up in the 90s/early 2000s it was super common to drop kids off. Even past 2010 when I was babysitting I took over for a parent at the end of a 5yr-old party and the parents came and picked their kids up. \n\nMaybe things have changed? My son\u2019s only 2 so we\u2019re a few years off learning the proper decorum. Just based on my own history with parties you were a bit harsh to this mother. Is her child badly behaved? At five with other children to play with what kind of care does she really need? She would be playing would she not? However, I can\u2019t vote because maybe it is really weird not to stay for kid\u2019s parties where you are?", "YTA. Since when do little kids parties require a 1 to 1 ratio of adults to children. Most parents drop the kids off, then pick them up. If you don't want to have it that way them you must state the intention in the invites. But honestly, this is weird", "I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that rude to assume the kid can just go to a party since it\u2019s not uncommon for them to not be accompanied at them, usually in a group kids don\u2019t need to all be individually chaperoned unless they\u2019re actual toddlers and just having a couple adults around while they play is usually enough, like in classrooms and daycares (I know those are jobs and part of your point is it\u2019s not your job, which I understand). I\u2019ve never once had (as a kid), been to or hosted a kids party where parents or guardians were *expected* to stay and have always just seen it as part of hosting to be somewhat responsible for watching the kids.\n\nAll that being said, I also think it\u2019s okay for you to not want to do that. 5 is very young and I get not wanting to be responsible for a whole class full of kids for the entire party, I think it would be more sensible to ask if the parents are familiar with any other parents who *will* be there who can take responsibility for the kid(s) father than just saying they can\u2019t come at all, but you\u2019re the one hosting so it is your call. \n\n*Personally* I think NAH, because as I said I don\u2019t think she\u2019s made any unreasonable assumptions nor are you in the wrong for being wary about watching all the kids. I think it\u2019s just a case of you both having different opinions and approaches to the situation rather than one of you being in the wrong.", "I have never been to or hosted a kids party where the parents were expected to attend. If you're unable to host the party, don't throw it. Don't expect parents to waste their afternoon for your kid. \n\nAs it sounds now, there's only one unattended kid. If you don't want the responsibility of watching one extra kid with like 10 adults there, causing the kid to miss a party your own kid wanted him or her to attend, than yes, YTA.", "NAH.  I wouldn't say it's standard procedure to expect all the parents to stay once the kids are old enough to be away from their parents with their friendship group from school.

But yes if you invite 20 kids and have the party in a public parc you need adults present to kepe them from running in all directions, but that is your repsonsibility, not the parents", "YTA\n\nIt's a pretty common thing that kids are dropped off and a set number of parents normally stick around for these parties or they get excessively crowded. It's weird to expect a parent for every child, that isn't a common practice.", "Well, I'm old but in my day, my sister had a birthday party when she had just started school, like first grade. Every kid in her class came but certainly not all the parents.  Kids were sent/dumped off with a gift, played games, ate cake and went home.  Why does every kid need an adult?", "I\u2019d say NAH. My son is only five months so he hasn\u2019t been to any parties yet, but I remember going to classmates parties as a kid and it was definitely the norm to just drop your kids off and leave them there.

It\u2019s right on the edge of age appropriate to drop kids off, so opinions may differ - it could go the other way, with parents assuming they are invited and the host isn\u2019t prepared for extra guests! Send invites saying children should be accompanied by an adult - follow up with them after RSVP to make sure it\u2019s understood!", "When did it become the norm to invite every kid in the class? When I was a kid birthday parties were for the kids I was actually friends with, so like 6 other kids maximum, and parents just dropped us off because there weren't 20 fucking kids to worry about. \n\nMaybe try planning better?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m going completely out in a limb here- but when I was a child, kids were dropped off by their parents at birthday parties and collected them at the end (Australia)\n\nI may be the odd one out, but I enjoy a child only party- otherwise I\u2019m entertaining kids and adults (most I don\u2019t know)\n\nI\u2019m a mother of two (8 and 16) and unless we specified it was a bbq is was a drop off/ pick up or pick up then dinner after\n\nYou\u2019re a cracker \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe only time I\u2019d expect full supervision is if we were feeding crocodiles or racing kangaroos \n\nApart from that- it\u2019s a laid back party with games and fairy bread", "This is so weird. Why would parents stay? If you're inviting so many kids that you can't control the crowd, invite fewer kids. YTA.", "NTA. My kid is 6 turning 7 and parents absolutely still stay. And if they want to bring siblings, they ask first.", "First rule with other kids' parents---never assume. If you require a parent/guardian to stay with the child, you  have to specify on the invitation. Ditto, make a statement that siblings are not invited. I raised three kids and had to do this for every single party. Sometimes, verbally when the guest arrived with a sibling anyway. eta: I'm in the US  \nNTA, but take this as advice for the future.", "NAH. It\u2019s pretty standard where I\u2019m from (in the US) for not all of the parents to stay. In fact, many kid birthday venues don\u2019t even have the space to accommodate that many parents. But of course everywhere and everyone is different. If the invite didn\u2019t specify, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to assume it would be ok at that age, the same way you\u2019re assuming everyone should know it\u2019s not ok. Now you know for next time (if there is a next time) to put the full expectations on the invite.", "YTA. This seems a bit weird to have a parent for every child there and I\u2019ve not heard this before for kids plus 4/5.

You assume it's only the kids unless told otherwise. Or unless your invite states otherwise. Your invite needs to specifically state ; \"kiddo is required to have their patent accompany them, no drop offs\".\n\nThis is why I chose parties carefully and account for no extra adults. Ie chuck e cheese where the kids can't leave the building.... renting a movie theater and position a family member at the exit door. I don't do pool parties because I will not be responsible for children I don't know around water etc etc etc. \n\nAlso if the school has an inclusion policy; work around it. I know, for a fact, my sanity will not accommodate a birthday party with over 30 kids (20 from her classroom; some family members kids; and of course the kids who come with an uninvited sibling); space cannot always accommodate 30 kids; and my finances cannot accommodate 30 kids....therefore I do not invite the whole classroom despite inclusion policies. \n\nI'll use the classroom list and compare the last names to the emails from the teacher that she sends to all the parents and then send an email invite to 5-10 kids that my kid chooses to invite. \n\nAlso I'm FIRMLY against inclusion policies; my kid should not by forced to spend time or hang out with people she is uncomfortable with.

So when I next host my 9 year olds birthday I\u2019ll calculate my wage + his, I hold a Bachelor of Ed (Primary Teacher Phys Ed Major) and CPR + specialising in Behaviour\nMy husband is ex-Military, Security and currently a Prison Officer with specialised BA(Breathing Apparatus) training\n\nSo with your logic, we can combine our incomes divided by 365 and give our son a fun time?\n\nWorks out to be $575/ child not including taxes or overtime \n\nThanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude02", "Well you are here the one asking AITA for not allowing 1 child to attend without a parent. So if you cannot handle one child without a parent and you don't put that on the invites and you make an issue out of it, that means YTA", "So you are assuming that you are required to stay at these parties? Why? There was nothing on the invite, no one told you you had to stay with the kid- so how is it evidence in your favour that you assumed what you do is the standard?", "Invite children and parents then. It's not standard from party to party at that age. People can't read minds. I have learned to ask or be ready for either scenario when the invite doesn't state expectations. Drop-offs seem ridiculous to you, but they aren't objectively ridiculous. Your invite wasn't clear, so no need to be outraged. You will some day need someone's understanding when other parenting protocol differences arise.", "But why are they staying if they're not even going to watch their kids? You said you think it's unfair that the adults aren't watching their children, but then you say it's the norm for parents to hang out/watch TV (i.e., NOT watch out for the kids).", "Every one I've been to. It has gotten more common these days when both parents have to work. Usually it's worked out in advance though.", "Why did you even post here if you just wanted to argue everyone who doesn't agree?", "Why ask the question if you don\u2019t want an answer? You clearly think you\u2019re right, because you just keep arguing with comments that disagree with you. You just wanted everyone to validate your position. Part of hosting is watching the kids, but apparently - even with the assistance of other adults - you\u2019re not up to that. If you wanted an adult to stay then you should have put that on the invitation. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be hosting parties, or making posts, until you\u2019re capable of understanding these concepts.", "No kids birthday my kids attended older than 3 in the last years had parents staying. Not one", "NTA, especially after finding out she intended to bring an extra uninvited child. Ballsy!\n\nIf you want a parent to stay, you should include it on the invite. You can do this politely: \u201cA parent or guardian is encouraged to attend with their child. No siblings please. We look forward to meeting you!\u201d If you\u2019re comfortable with siblings, you can change it to \u201cSiblings are welcome too.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll get some disgruntled parents, but you\u2019ve set your expectations and they can take it or leave it. None of this back and forth bargaining crap. The parents can figure out how to make it happen on their end if it\u2019s important to them.\n\nHonestly, when my child was younger, I wanted to go to these parties. It was a great opportunity to meet his friends and meet their parents and see the friend dynamics. Parents exchanged numbers, made plans for park meetups, talked about teachers or the best family activity spots or had peer conversations about developmental milestones and just commiserated about our crazy kids. We actually had time to chat vs. the school pickup/drop off rushed hellos. \n\nTo reply to the \u201cwhat child parties don\u2019t automatically imply a parent stays\u201d bit. 5-6 is sort of the cusp. At 5 years, there is no way I\u2019d be comfortable dumping my kid at a party where I didn\u2019t know the hosts, but at 7 years, I\u2019d expect more families to expect to simply drop their child off and leave or maybe tangentially hang out in the location for convenience vs. active parenting.", "My pre-k parties when I was a kid! You'll get a heart attack when I tell you that with mine all my invited classmates were dropped off and no parent stayed. We had my family members and none watched us as we were in a contained area were we played without constant supervision. Only once a while when we'd get quiet, some one screamed too loud or it was time for food, blowing out candles, drinks and gift opening.\n\nSo to remind, yes none of the other parents stayed and my mom only knew 2 of the 10 attending classmates' parents. Everything was fine. It's normal, by the age of 7 we were running around the neighborhood playing and my mom would call us for dinner time only. \n\nYou have the best at heart but are too concerned on something minor as this. So even so I'd have to say YTA.", "I literally just hosted a birthday party for my four year old this weekend.  Most parents just dropped off their kids and left, only two parents( that we are friends with) stayed.  Part of my job as the host is to supervise the children, also with all the kids together they occupy their selves.  It\u2019s a bit absurd to ask a parent to stay for a 5 year olds party.  FYI I live in Canada", "This party could be an opportunity to collect contact info so when your kids say in the future that they want to have x y and z over for their party you know how to get a hold of their parents without calling the school. Make the most of it.", "I always found kids' birthday parties stressful and was so happy to give the last. It wasn't even the parties that bothered me so much, but the loot bags. Heaven help you if your loot bags were disappointing.", "I don't remember any of my birthday parties having parents invited, maybe other than one when my mum invited her friend to have somebody to talk to while I played with the other kids.\n\nThere was also one time my sister's friend's mum came, but that was shortly after that friend was diagnosed with diabetes and she needed somebody to keep her sugar levels in check", "I'm also early thirties and never had parents stay at my birthday parties with their kids. When throwing parties for my 11 year old now though, parents definitely stay, without asking if they should or not.", "I would say the 90s/early 2000s were definitely a different time. I was unsupervised very often, but I also grew up in Japan and Korea, much safer places than the US especially for children.", "In my experience (NZ) 5-6 is the switch over time from parents accompanying their kids to parties and not accompanying them. School seems to make the difference somehow. My daughter is 8 now and up til and including her 5th birthday her daycare, swimming and ballet friends parents all stayed. After a year at school for her 6th birthday all the school friend parents just dropped their kid off and checked what time pick up was. The only parents who stayed were family friends.", "These days in Australia parents tend to stay till about 7-9ish depending on the kid and the relationship with the birthday kids parents.  I tend to stay because my daughters are autistic and it\u2019s less stressful for everyone if I\u2019m there to keep an eye on them.", "Parent to an 8 yr old, every party I've been at since my son started kindy has all the parents attending. The hosts even provide food for the adults as well, this is pretty much the norm where I live in NSW nowadays.", "My job is to host the party, not watch the 15 five year olds. Thankfully not that many are coming.", "German here, parents don\u2019t stay for kids birthday parties for kids older than 3.\n\nTotally weird.", "Absolutely not an income thing. My parents were well of and my friend group was pretty well mixed up and it were all drop off partys ever. :)", "Right. When my kid was young I also had food and drinks for the parents too.  I think this lady doesn't know what host means.", "Agreed! Its not that different now! \n\nMy kid's 6th birthday party was at a Chuck-E-Cheese - all but one parent dropped off. The parent who stayed, hovered over me and made it almost impossible for me to watch the other kids. Fortunately, the manager saw this and did some MAJOR distraction! All party invites from then on said \"kids only\" \n\nAnd if these are all classmates, then the kids are not strangers to each other. While I agree that it's important for you to know your kids' friends' parents, that puts the onus on you to reach out and becomes friends/acquaintances with that person. Make them \"not a stranger\" \n\nOP, have you reached out to the other parents to make sure they are coming with their kids? If not, then YTA for assuming.", "Would you trust strangers with your 5 and 6 year olds for 3 hours?", "It is nice of you to babysit others kids for a couple of hours, but I'm not doing that. My responsibility is to ensure my kids are taken care of, the event goes well,  and that nothing is damaged at the venue. Hosting is already stressful enough. I've been in childcare before and I'd prefer to not have to do it with multiple kids again.", "Right?! Like the only parents/ adults that stay for a school children\u2019s birthday are the friends and family. My two school kiddos have gotten invites and none say parent must attend. The only time I expected parents to stay was for first birthdays. My niece just had a birthday with like 10 kids and she was the only adult for most of the party.", "It's enough watching one kid to one adult. It's not ANY OTHER adult's job there to watch after two kids that aren't theirs.", "This parent was trying to lay TWO of her kids on me.", "Definitely keeping receipts haha", "Yeah it definitely makes sense for parents to hang out at these things, just felt weird to me at first because it's not how I remember it.... And with that sentence I have officially turned into my grandmother lol", "I also grew up in that time period in the US. I think the big difference between them and now was who expected to be invited to birthdays: it wasn't the entire class. At most it'd be all the girls or all the boys, depending on the gender of the birthday kid. And there wasn't a lot of pressure in my community to throw big parties. Certainly, I never had one, nor did most of my classmates. Today, you're judged for the quality of the party you throw and don't you dare not invite the entire class. Then, you invited just your close friends. Also, if we walked to the neighborhood park without a parent in tow the cops weren't being called because we were unaccompanied. We've collectively become a lot more paranoid/protective since then.\n\nBut. Of the big parties I recall from my childhood, there was an effort made by the hosting parents to ensure that there was enough adult supervision for that number of children without needing every child accompanied by the parent. Maybe it was just a few mom friends among the birthday kid's classmates, maybe it was having a large extended family so that between parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, every kid had a set of eyes on them. But not every parent showed up to the big parties, and that would not have always been welcome because of the extra food costs.\n\nHere, you have a family with three kids, and you state that you live in an area with a lot of military families. For all you know, Dad's either going from Church to work or this is the only day of the week they have to do errands. Taking an infant to a party not set up for babies is a pain, and there's a third kid. Now, I personally think it's rather entitled to think that both the 5 and 6 year old are welcome when only one is on the invitation and presumably knows the birthday kid, and mom never asked if the 6 year old was welcome, just said they were coming. And it's laughable that a child so young can watch and be responsible for another child; they aren't old enough to be responsible for themselves. I'd feel differently if mom had said 'the only way to attend is if me and all three kids show up', but she didn't.\n\nHowever, I think there's a compromise here that allows you to focus on keeping the party going while not excluding a child whose family is in a challenging position. I would ask the mother with three kids to talk to the other parents in the class and find one who will agree to keep an eye on the 5 year old during the party. I think it's reasonable to assume that there's one who's up to watching two kids, and likely one who knows this particular child better than you. It's not unreasonable for one adult to watch two kids. But consent here is key, and that's on her to arrange now that you have said that you don't have the capacity to manage your kid, the whole party, and a child you don't know.", "Yeah I'm thinking back on my birthday parties and it is kinda craxy to me how chill parents were about strangers just because they also had kids? My 6th birthday we had a slumber party where all the girls from my class stayed over all night and there were no parents. Also the time I was 9 and we had a laser tag party that involved all the kids getting dropped off at my house then my parents drove all 10 kids to laser tag and back to our house. Obviously it was fine but now that I think about it idk if I would be comfortable with that if I had kids \ud83d\ude05", "For a kid\u2019s birthday party watching and entertaining the kids is what hosting means. This is very weird. YTA", "Yeahh I don't see this party going well for op. Reminds me of a birthday party of one of my kids friends. All the parents crammed into the hosts living room, host didn't talk with anyone and all the kids stood by their parents barely interacting. It was strange, we left after about 10 minutes.\n\nOp, I personally like when most parents don't stay for my kids parties. I've learned over the years all the kids interact more. When parents are present they are more shy. I leave it up to the parent tho as I've stayed at multiple parties when other parents didn't just because I didn't trust the hosts at all lol if you expect parents to stay you need to reach out to every one and clarify. Then at the party you need to continually interact with each parent. That's your job as a host. Future reference as others have said you need to put it on the invite that they are expected to stay. Good luck op!", "Wait until you hear about babysitters", "Usually you meet the other parents first but then yes. It's a short time at a set location with multiple other children your kids know well and at least 2 adults present. It's not like they're toddlers. 1 teacher is able to handle them all 5 days a week just fine, so this seems like an overreaction. \n\nAt some point you need to trust your own parenting enough to know that your kids won't wreck stuff or sneak off to do something dangerous if you're not hovering over them constantly.", "They are not strangers, they are the parents pf my kids friends?", "...Do your kids attend any type of public school or preschool?", "What do you think school is?", "Then don't throw birthday parties and invite other kids, it's as simple as that.", "Also, you come off as super not nice in your post.
