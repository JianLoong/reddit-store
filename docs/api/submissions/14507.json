Just because its your parents doesnt give them the right to do it. If anybody else was doing it you know what you would call it? Creepy as hell", "NTA\n\nBut before you delete it, at least have some fun with it. There are tools for spoofing your location (intended for app developers to test with).

Now is the time for you to establish boundaries with your parents. If you believe they have crossed a line, you have the ability to call them out, and set your own expectations. They can't threaten you with a lot of money, since you're paying for your phone and education.", "YWNBTA. I get you're their kid and they want to keep you safe and all. But you're an adult. You're in college. You're paying your own way. How long will they keep this up? That sort of helicoptering is obsessive and bordering on creepy. But you'd be well within your rights to delete it. You're not a child any longer.", "As a parent I completely understand worrying about your children when they are away from you. But your parents have taken it way too far. Delete the app. It's time you start establishing some healthy boundaries with them before it'stoo late. If they pitch a fit, I would gently remind them of what they have done in the past to violate the emergency only rule. Best of luck!", "NTA  \n\n\nyou paying for your shit? youre a grownass woman. delete the app", "NTA- I hate apps like life360. They can be taken advantage of so easily and parents love using them to control their kids, even when they're adults. You're 18 and financially independent, so this is easy. Delete the app. It doesn't matter if they get mad. They don't get to make decisions for you. \n\nIf they do get mad, it's time to start setting some boundaries. Yes you're young, but they are being way over the top, and they have abused the ability to see your location multiple times in the past. It is in no way okay to track someones location so you can show up where they are, or interrogate them about what they're doing. They don't need to know what you're doing all the time.", "YWNBTA. There are so many other ways to track phones in an emergency.", "NTA. That sounds obnoxious. Delete it.", "NTA you're an adult, you're at college, you're independent. They're gonna have to let it go eventually.", "NTA. But if you are at all financially dependent on your parents (health insurance, help with rent or food money, etc) then you may need to be cautious- you shouldn\u2019t have to allow them to stalk you, but some people are unreasonable about those things.", "YWNBTA and frankly the details about what you've paid off and what you haven't are irrelevant. You're an adult woman, your parents have absolutely no right to have a stalking app on your phone under any circumstances.\n\nEdit: even if they were telling the truth, and it really was only for emergencies, it *still* would be your choice and no one else's. The fact that they lied to you and wanted it on your phone so they could stalk you just gives you more reason to choose to delete it.", "You WNBTA if you delete this app. Especially because they\u2019ve now stalked you and shown up where you are. How do they even have the time to follow you places? \n\nYou could stillI have a conversation with them about this and call them out on it.", "NTA. As an alternative stategy, get a new phone and give your old one to a stripper.", "NTA.  You are 18 and an adult.  Delete it.  Better yet, just get a new phone with a new plan if you can swing it...and forget to put the app back on.", "\"... wherever I go, I'm going to get yet another call asking where I am, even though I don't know why they do that since they obviously know where I am.\"\n\nThey're not asking because they don't know, they're pretending not to know to maintain the fiction that they're not tracking you. They don't realize that you know. So, the question is a lie.\n\nSo next time they ask, lie right back. Tell them you're in the dorm when you're at the library. If they call you on it, ask them how do they know if they're not tracking you? If they don't call you on it, keep it up. Never give a straight answer. Make your current location less believable each time, basically dare them to call you on it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd do this, but then I am definitely an asshole.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou're an adult. And they are invading your privacy and autonomy. They are doing exactly what they said they would not do. I understand they worry that things will happen to you. But just like every other sane parents in the world, they have to let you live your own life and make your own mistakes and pray every night that you make it home safe", "NTA. I understand wanting to be able to make sure that your children are safe, but you're an adult now and don't need to share you location with anyone that you don't want to. To them you will be TA, but that's okay because at this point, they aren't entitled to know where you're at. Go ahead and delete it.", "NTA. You're an adult, but may I suggest the petty approach and start spending a lot more time in lingerie and more stores?", "You could\u2019ve deleted it the moment you got it and not have been an AH. NTA and I hope your relationship with your parents can still be a good one.", "NTA - they\u2019ll never give up that power on their own.", "NTA! My college aged son and I have it, but tbh, he tracks me way more than I ever have him. They are clearly abusing that access, I would drop it too!", "NTA. But BTW if you keep going home every weekend they will always expect it. I\u2019d recommend cutting back to 1x a month to establish some independence.", "NTA. Your parents are trying to be protective but it can certainly be too stalker-ish. I had to come to terms with this for my step kids and a niece when they got to be 18+. I had to step back a bit and let them live their respective (private) lives. And as others have stated, you're an adult +/- ... especially if you're paying a lot of your own expenses. You don't have to *delete* the app. You can simply *pause location sharing*. You'll certainly be approached about it as soon as your parents see it. But you can leave the app on your phone and turn on location sharing when you travel etc so they'll feel better about you being safe, getting to your destination, etc. This is what I do with my niece when she travels alone. It's a small compromise but may help with weening your parents off.", "NTA. they have clearly broken the agreement they made by using it outside of emergencies. given the fact that you pay for all your own shit i would say delete that baby asap and tell them if they\u2019re wanting to know where you are they can ask ONCE like a reasonable person", "NTA that app is creepy af", "Also is there a reason you go home every weekend?  Time to fly the nest and live your own life.", "NTA for deleting it if they are crossing a boundary.  However, my son is also at college and comes home once a month and we have find my iPhone activated on all our phones.  I track his progress in the trip down and back to\nschool which he is well aware of for safety reasons.\n\nMy daughter gets home from work before my husband and me and uses the same App to make sure the door is open and unlocked when we get home.\n\nAnd we \u201cstalk\u201d each other for other \u201cfun\u201d reasons (husband asking me to pick something up when he sees me at the grocery store).  But we are all on board with using it and don\u2019t cross boundaries with it.\n\nSo NTA if you are not comfortable with it, then have a conversation with your parents and then take it off.", "YTA..........to yourself. If you are independent and paying for your college and things then you should never have installed it in the first place.\n\nYou are an adult and have every right to privacy, especially from your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a protected young woman myself back in the day, I understand your reluctance to start this maelstrom of recrimination and suspicion.

Be polite, but tell them it isn't their decision anymore.", "The app itself is fine, my husband and I have it with our 20 year old son. I'll get a random message asking if Sam's club has kleenex cause he needs to bring some to the tech college and he could see I was there.

We call it the stalker app. We keep an eye on each other for convenience, but mostly for safety. When my son asked why at age 18, I told because if anything happens to you, I'll know where to start. \n\nHe currently works in a rough side of the city. He stays late sometimes to study. I'll check his location and then send him a text \"all good?\". And he replies\"yep\". And we move on. Of course, as mom, I keep my eye on the clock and the app to make sure. \n\nNone of my kids have a problem with it but it's probably because they know we are concerned about safety and not about not trusting their decisions.", "I only come home on the weekends to see friends and family and to work. When I say parents I'm referring to my dad and step mom. If I get kicked out for whatever reason I can always stay with my mom over breaks and such.", "That seems like a reasonable compromise. You can gently tell them that they no longer need to know where you are at all times,  but you could turn it on after a visit so that they could see you made it home safely.", "I go home on the weekends to visit my friends and family, and I still have my job there.", "We do all of this too! And my son\u2019s first semester I did sometimes check his location just see him sitting in his dorm. Sometimes I would then text something like \u201chey, the Fb group says there\u2019s <event> today. Have you thought about going?\u201d That was as far into stalking as I got. And I usually forgot to even do that much. Second semester he got sent home for a year and a half due to the pandemic. So the novelty wore off.", "They'd likely get pissed at me for that too. They've got location markers on my school as well as all my siblings' schools, our house, church, and my job. I went to pass my job one day and I didn't want them to get the notification that I arrived/left so I turned my phone on airplane mode for just a few seconds while I passed it... got a call asking where I was and why my location was off.", "Okay got it! I still recommend establishing boundaries with your parents. If you pay for everything they don\u2019t really have a lot to hold over you. It\u2019s possible to be completely respectful but also make it clear that tracking you is no longer going to happen since they\u2019ve shown they cannot help themselves from respecting you as an adult (ie showing up where you are or calling all the time)."]}
