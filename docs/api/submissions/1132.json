She is now saying she doesn\u2019t want to see me again and she is saying she cancels all plans. This is something she does when I suggest other plans bc of my parents. I understand it can be sad to have plans changed bc of someone else but I make solutions and I thought she\u2019d understand. It\u2019s also worth nothing my dad is older than the average father. She called me toxic and said she wants to go, so I went on PlayStation then she got mad at me again for going online.

This pattern of behavior by gf is controlling and even bullying.  If this were a woman saying it, everybody would be saying to dump him.  This woman is looney tunes.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has priorities. Your priority is your family, and that is ok. Lots of people have family as a high priority. Your girlfriend doesn't like this. She doesn't accept it, and she's not willing to work around it. When you make a suggestion that's a compromise, it seems she goes nuclear and then nothing is good enough. It is her way, or a tantrum - and she seems to deal other things by having a tantrum too. That's not the adult way to deal with things. You will find a girlfriend who accepts, and respects your love of your family, and is willing to compromise so everyone is happy, and who communicates and works through problems rather than acting like a toddler.", "Red Flags man.
