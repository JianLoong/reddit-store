If they want you there, then they can have you as you are: a woman. You deserve to be loved and respected for yourself, not for how well you can pretend to be the person they think you should be.", "NTA. Invitations that carry conditions rarely make people feel comfortable. If you give in this time, it will be expected every time.", "NTA.\n\nDon't go. You will not have a good time at family dinner in this case.", "Absolutely NTA 100%\n\n\nIt is fine for you to stand up for yourself. This is who you are, so your folks' neighbours should know about it. It's nothing shameful, nothing to be hidden away. \n\n\nYour dad is the one with the issue here, it's not on you to be someone you're not to make him more comfortable", "NTA. I hope you get to spend the holiday with people who appreciate you as your true self.", "NTA.\n\nIf he doesn't want *you* there, then there's no reason for you to go. He wants someone else to go, and that person doesn't exist. You're under no obligation to dress up as that person for him.\n\nAlso, feminine things (I assume in the specific case of someone they think of as male, not in general...) might upset his friends and neighbours? What has that got to do with a family dinner? He's trying to project his own transphobia onto those around him and use that as an excuse for his own actions.", "NTA you already know this answer\n\nYou are being asked to lie to make others more comfortable. Choosing to be honest about a situation is will always make you on the side of right.\n\nThis is completely ignoring the upset you may experience by representing a version of your self you don\u2019t associate with.", "NTA.\n\nConsidering how hard you've worked to change your life for the better, how hard you've worked to accept yourself for who you are, why would you reverse all that work to boost your dad's ego over your own well being?  Sorry, it makes no sense to me.  \n\nIt's going to cause issues no matter what, whether you show up or not.  So, out of respect for your family, and for yourself, don't go.  Let them have their holiday to themselves in peace.  No one wants that kind of drama on Thanksgiving.  Since their reactions will be the cause of the drama, no matter what you wear, pass on it.  You'll be healthier in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYou're a woman. Why would you pretend to be a man to attend a dinner?", "NTA. If your father doesn\u2019t want *you* there, then why go at all? It\u2019s a shame he can\u2019t prioritise not wanting to upset his own child rather than the neighbours, but hopefully with time he\u2019ll change his tune. Sorry it\u2019s like this - it can take a very long time for some parents to get over their old ideas of you.", "NTA. You already offered a compromise, and that wasn\u2019t good enough, so don\u2019t go at all . If you do attend, you\u2019ll likely be in for some drama and hurt feelings, so if it were me, I\u2019d stay home so I didn\u2019t have to experience it in person. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this at all.", "NTA. Everyone in your family seems focused on what will make your father comfortable. You need to do what makes you comfortable. Will you be happy being with your family on their terms? Or is it better to stay home? I\u2019m sorry you are being put in this position. I wish your father would accept you for who you are.", "NTA\nTheir comfort and delicate sensibilities is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Screw that, you are who you are. They either want YOU there, or the boy you never were. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your dad is making this so difficult for you. The fact that he's asking you to change away from who you are because of embarrassment shows that he doesn't accept you unfortunately. \n\nThe way I see it, you have two options. One, show up as your whole true self IF you believe you'll be safe (if you don't think you'll be safe, this is not an option). Two, enjoy a nice quiet day off. Watch the parade and eat some pumpkin pie. \n\nI don't think you should have to show up as someone you aren't.\n\nCongrats on your social transition!", "NTA. \n\nSo your father would rather upset you, his daughter, than upset his friends and neighbours?\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say but your family really doesn\u2019t want you there, they want the mask you wore before.\n\nPlease don\u2019t back down.\n\nAnd may you find true heart family.", "NTA of course.  You can do two things. You can go in your girliest clothes or you could not go at all. They need to start accepting the new you. If they dont, well then thats on them when you decide to go LC . Too bad if it upsets your father and or his friends.", "NTA. This is who you are. If people will have an issue with that, and your father chooses those people over your well being, you shouldnt go.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren't welcome as yourself, don't go.  Ask around and have Thanksgiving with friends or do something on your own (movie theaters are open in the afternoon).\n\nAlso, start planning your Christmas because that will be an even bigger problem.", "NTA you have every right to show up how you want. If he was concerned about your safety because of a specific neighbor it might be different. \n\nThey want you to deny who you are to make them more comfortable without considering how you\u2019ll feel. He\u2019s more concerned about his friends\u2019 and neighbors\u2019 opinions than he is your comfort and being the real you. They are the asshole here not you.", "NTA.  Don't go.  Your father isn't willing to accept you yet and you shouldn't compromise yourself for his comfort.  If you do, he'll never change.  \n\nFind a way to be with family and friend who love and appreciate you as who you are on Thanksgiving and tell your stepmother, thanks for the invite, but maybe next year.", "Nta they must accept the new you.", "NTA and go no contact /low contact with them. Don\u2019t go there and see if you can go w a friend for t giving or charity work, literally anything that doesn\u2019t include being around those transphobes jfc", "NTA. If he doesn't want you there as yourself, I wouldn't go. He is only thinking about his and his friends comfort, not yours. I wouldn't want to go somewhere where I am not welcome as myself. You are not ruining the evening by not going. Your father is ruining it by being intolerant.", "NTA. Your dad is putting everyone else\u2019s comfort in front of yours and that is very telling.", "NTA you're not ruining it, your father's transphobia is", "NTA. You are absolutely fucking not the asshole here. You're not even a hint of an asshole. \n\nYou are who you are.\n\n\"Save everyone the drama and don't invite me to any event where you expect me to pretend to be a man. If that means we'll no longer be in each other's lives, so be it.\"", "NTA. Tell your brothers you'll come as a guy if they all come as girls. Thats fair right/s", "NTA set the standard now - you won't pretend to be a man for the comfort of people who can't accept you. If you do it for Thanksgiving, it'll be used in the future to badger and harrass you every time you get an invitation to come visit", "NTA and you're female. If they're forcing you to come as your dead self(if I'm wording this correctly), don't go. Be yourself.", "NTA\n\nIf your father values the opinions of outsiders more than your well-being, he can only blame himself when you don't come home for the holidays. \n\n I imagine it's very hard on you already and your dad's request is outrageous. You know what? Spend Thanksgiving with people who actually care about you.", "NTA\n\nYour dad doesn't get it and that's a him problem, not a you problem. If my five year old could understand why his cousin was changing her name- your dad has no excuse.\n\nAlso, as a fellow woman, glad to have you on our team \ud83e\udd70", "NTA. You go as the woman you are, or don\u2019t go at all. You deserve to spend time with people that love and respect you for who you are.", "NTA. \n\nUnless your brothers are willing to go \"as girls\". But it sadly seems like none of them are decent enough people to lash out at your father's bigotry on your behalf.", "NTA - If he can\u2019t except you as you are then he doesn\u2019t need to be in your life.  Just be sure to tell everyone why exactly you are not going.  You don\u2019t want dear ol\u2019 dad to make up a story.", "Gonna be completely against the grain here. ESH.  \n\nAs much as Reddit is the safe haven for all things trans related, we need to be realistic here. It sounds like you live far enough away from your parents that nobody sees you regularly or very often, and if you only came out last month, many people probably have not heard about this or have had time to adjust. And contrary to what Reddit likes to believe, people need time to adjust and accept when someone changes their gender. I think the best idea would be to not go and spend time with friends if possible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If OP is like 30 years old, her father raised a boy then man for 30 years and is expected to just adjust to that in under a month", "She isn't expecting him to adjust in under a month, shes expecting him to accept her and not be pushed back into the closet. He's not trying to adjust right now, he's trying to ignore who she is for his own comfort", "OP said she started to socially transition a month ago.
