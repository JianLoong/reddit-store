And I wouldn't invite her to the first milestones for awhile- she will likely post pictures of your baby on social media without your permission when she first meets them, and will probably ruin the first birthday party too.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your wife.", "NTA- the petty in me would have blurted out \" i pity your child, for having a mother who can't stand not getting all the attention!\". Your sister is a horrible asshole and your parents aren't far behind. Not one of them can read the room. Congratulations from this internet auntie!", "NTA", "NTA your sister sounds seriously messed up to do that and make that comment. I'm glad you stood up for your wife. Why would she announce it to a room of mostly Julia's people? That's the kind of thing you should announce at something with her partner's people too. And most people usually wait a bit longer to announce these days because of those risks particularly in the early days. I think I was about 4 months before telling people about my pregnancy. Doing it that way was a pure inappropriate attention grab. I really hope your wife was ok and the sweet moments could continue. Congratulations on your baby girl", "NTA - congratulations to you and your wife though.", "NTA.\n\n \u201cThis is such crazy timing Julia because GUYS I just found out I\u2019m pregnant too! ***Within the first week of trying, crazy right***!\u201d\n\nShe knew what she was doing by making that comment.\n\nGood job for standing your ground!", "Nta it was your and your wife\u2019s day she kinda ruined it", "NTA \nYour sister tried to steal the spotlight and the fact that she said she could get pregnant with just a few tries when your wife struggled so much was such an evil and malicious comment. Doesn't she have common sense? Does she lack empathy? Or is she just an attention seeker? Maybe all the options above. Your response was actually polite, I'd say worse things.", "And to rub it in your wife's face that she got pregnant in week of trying? Your sister has the emotional intelligence of a chair. NTA.", "Very much an \u201cI\u2019m better than you\u201d meaning there. Hideous. Alex should hope that no later problems arise, rather than boasting of her ease at conceiving \u2014 especially since she probably made this announcement rather early, in order to step on Julia\u2019s moment.", "NTA you don't make big announcements at someone else's party. Your sister was way wrong.", "Good lord, NTA and your sister and mom are massive AH's.  I'd be going very LC with them.  What they did was unforgivable.  And block your sister.\n\nI wouldn't even tell them when your child is born because they'll make it all about your sister and ruin the moment.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister was intentionally trying to hurt you and your wife! Letting everyone know that she got pregnant on the first try was not necessary and mean spirited. \n\nShe\u2019s also announcing really early if she just found out and it definitely could have waited until after the celebration for your little girl. \n\nGood on you for standing up for your wife too!", "NTA. Pretty sad she couldn't read the room.", "NTA and i'll never understand how people feel okay making big announcements at other people's events.", "NTA...  she wanted the attention.  She knows how hard it was for y'all and she disrespected your wife", "NTA. \n\nOP and their wife has gone through a rough time when it comes to having children and Alex announcing she's pregnant AND saying that they were lucky enough to get it right in the first try was very selfish.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s rude in general to do that, but the comment about getting pregnant easily shows she is either the least self aware person on the planet or just cruel. \n\nGood for you standing up for your wife.", "NTA.  why do people always get upset when they're called out in public after being rude in public?", "Good grief. Totally NTA. Your sister is the AH and your parents are enablers.", "NTA. There is time to do it and at another baby shower is not", "NTA.", "Oof.\n\nYeah, baby shower for someone else is not the proper place to announce. It's even worse in context of yours and your wife's issues and her bringing up how easy it was for her. NTA\n\nIf anyone has anything negative to say, just say your sister needs to learn some empathy and manners", "Within the FIRST WEEK! Not weeks.", "And even if, for some reason, she did know.....\n\nYou don't announce the pregnancy until 2nd trimester because miscarriages are common and almost expected before then. New parents are told by doctors not to spread the news until you're positive it's a viable pregnancy\n\nI would never in a million years wish miscarriage on this woman but goddamn", "I have a group of friends (we're 6) and most of us have suffered from infertility. I've known I can't have children of my own since I was about 15 (birth defect) so I've long made my peace with it. 1 of the girls tried for many years with her first husband, when they finally pin pointed the problem to his production levels, it broke up their marriage. She eventually met someone new but they were both in their mid-forties and he wasn't sure he wanted to go through that and she ended up giving up all together (it really messed with her mental health). Another friend didn't actively try to conceive but her husband had some infertility issues and he didn't care to do anything about it so she just gave up as well. One girl has been trying for 15 years. She's still with her husband but they have slowly become recluses and we see them maybe once a year, if they get out of their house at all. Another girl didn't want children at all (made a point of it) and many years ago decided to get off hormonal birth control and go with calendar cycle management. Got pregnant on the first month, decided to embrace the pregnancy considering all the infertility problems her friend's had, the boy is now 6, well loved and she's an amazing mom. Which brings us to my best friend who struggled with infertility for 4 years getting told over an over again by doctors that she was completely normal and should reasonably be able to get pregnant. Her husband refused to get checked for years because he could not imagine he was the problem. Well lo and behold, he was the \"problem\" (I hate saying this but he's an AH so I don't care this time). She had a side job that paid her good chunk of money every year that she would just save for years so they decided to pay for IVF with that, she went through the really difficult process (injections, creams, invasive appointments, emotional processing, anxiety, etc.). He didn't have to do squat but boy oh boy was he fucking proud when the first embryo to be injected took the first time.\n\nWe had a girl evening in the last few months of her pregnancy and he didn't have the decency to fuck off for the evening (just sat with us, controlling the conversation). Not many of my friends knew about my birth defect induced infertility (I never really brought it up), they all assumed I didn't want children but nobody ever mentioned it so I never corrected the assumption. That night, this asshat said something so vile, I could not believe he would say that out loud to an audience rife with infertility problems (he was aiming the comment at me because he's the kind of person who likes bringing people down when his self esteem is low). He said and I quote \"I think it's really selfish for people who CAN have children not to do anything in their power to get pregnant\"\n\nWe all looked at him like \"what the fuck do you mean?\"\n\nAnd his response was that we were all selfish for not doing more to get pregnant as they did especially me since \"I didn't want any children\".\n\nI blew up on him and told him that he did nothing to get his wife pregnant, she was the one who was fertile, she was the one who had to suffer all the treatments, she paid for the whole procedure with her own money and she was carrying the child. He would not be a father if it wasn't for her, he owed her everything. One of our other friends (the one who could not get her current partner to try and whose previous marriage broke off because they couldn't get pregnant) started to cry and I told everyone there that I would have loved to have children of my own and many of my relationships in the passed broke off because they wanted kids and I could not give that to them because of my birth defect. Everyone was shocked, his face was fucking priceless! I added that this didn't matter because I have been a \"parent\" for many years already through my step children and that I will always have had children before he ever did.\n\nWhen they introduced the baby for the first time (at a summer party a couple months after her birth) the first thing out of his mouth was \"look what I made\".\n\nSome people just think that successfully having a child of their own is a one up over everyone who can't/hasn't been able to yet. It's a nasty trick from the universe I will never understand.", "I wondered that, for sure!", "My good friend had been trying for five years to have their second and it was rough going, and they were doing ivf. My husband and I decided to start trying and got pregnant the first month. I felt so guilty for how quick it was that I thought something would be wrong with the baby because it's not fair that these wonderful people had it so tough and I just bumbled my way into it. I felt badly telling them but they were so supportive and wonderful and excited for us and then they just had their second this year. Biology is weird and shouldn't be used as a guidepost for success. This sister is a huge asshole.", "NTA. I believe the words to describe your sister are Attention Whore. Congratulations on your baby girl!!!", "NTA, go polish that shiny spine of yours", "NTA I\u2019m literally the most insensitive person when it comes to infertility, because I hate kids so I don\u2019t understand how people get upset about not being able to make them, and even I thought your sister stepped over a line here.", "NTA.  Your sister is something else.  Congratulations on becoming parents!  I\u2019m sure you guys will be great parents!", "NTA hellllll no! After all your wife has gone through this was vicious and cruel! Good on you for sticking up for you wife. It seems taking a break from your sister especially now after she gives birth! Also, congratulations!", "NTA. She proved just how petty she was beng when she made sure to note how quickly she got pregnant. It was a malicious jab by someone wanting attention. Not a joyful pregnancy announcement.", "NTA I woukd have just said \"and you think this was appropriate to mention at some else's celebrations because?\"", "It was very tone deaf of your sister add \u201cwithin the first week of trying\u201d given how you and your wife have been trying for 8 years.  NTA in the slightest.", "NTA; the line \"within the first week of trying\" is a deliberate stab at your wife and her past losses. I honestly wouldn't let my sister around my baby if she said something like that too me", "NTA - She knew ::exactly:: what she was doing. Don\u2019t let her convince you otherwise.", "NTA. \n\nMy sister and her husband decided to tie the knot in a courthouse ceremony with just the immediate family a few weeks before my cousin\u2019s wedding at a downstate winery with all of the family there.\n\nThey kept their mouths shut before, during, and until a few months later (after the glow of the cousin\u2019s wedding) when they finally start telling the non-immediate family that they got married earlier in the year.\n\nNo matter how excited they were for themselves, they knew it wasn\u2019t the time to make someone else\u2019s planned time about themselves.", "She made sure to mention how quickly she got pregnant, knowing what a struggle that was for OP and his wife. That's not a social boundary problem, that's a downright being nasty problem.", "Even worse, she said \"within the first week of trying,\" which is both cruel and nonsensical.", "The point being you are a liar."]}
