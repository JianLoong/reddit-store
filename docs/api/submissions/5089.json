Oh my god\u2026 Did she also wear white to your wedding? \n\nYour adult sister should have known better, absolutely knew better, and just had to steal your wife\u2019s thunder regardless.

Also, congratulations on your baby girl!", "NTA. You had your wife\u2019s back. That\u2019s as it should be.", "NTA\n\nShe hijacked your wife's baby shower for herself.

It\u2019s possible she doesn\u2019t understand social boundaries and wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious.

I applaud you for standing up for your wife like that.", "NTA. Not even close. All you did was put your self centered, nasty sister in her place. Kudos to you for standing up for your wife. Congratulations on your baby!", "NTA. But your sister is.  I'd cut her off because honestly I think you'll find your life is better without her in it.  I moved 24hrs away from my family and my life is so much better.", "NTA. First congratulations. Second you were far far too nice about it in my honest opinion.", "NTA. That\u2019s like proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding. Not her party, not her time. You are awesome for standing up for your wife.", "NTA your sister was insensitive and just plain rude.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister was raised in a barn. But so we're you: if she's not lying about her pregnancy, immediately and publicly insinuating she got pregnant so things could \"be about her\" is rather deranged.\n\nI blame your parents.", "Happy Cake Day!", "Happy Cake Day!", "They agreed it wasn\u2019t the right time and told her that, but are very happy for my sister", "I don't think OP is suggesting his sister got pregnant to steal the spotlight, I think OP is saying it's really rude and selfish to announce you're pregnant at someone else's baby shower. Which it is.", "It was about the timing of the announcement, not conceiving!", "I'm happy your parents stood by you and Julia!  Sounds like your sister has issues and I would have no low contact.", "Oh it is. Whence ESH.\n\nBut what OP said immediately and publicly can be interpreted in a lot of different ways, most of them rather embarassing for someone just announcing their pregnancy.\n\nI'd feel differently if he said \"I wish you could have announced this on any other day\". But instead it's like: well is she lying about being pregnant? Did she get pregnant on purpose to make a scene? Is she too selfish and immature to be a good mom?\n\nThis is the type of situation where it actually reflects worse on OP than on his sister. Which sucks because I do think she's also TA.", "I already agreed with that.

There is absolutely no reason to assume the offense was being pregnant and not the announcement.", "You won't find me disagreeing. Still makes him look worse than her.", "ESH stands for everyone sucks here. That means everyone is an asshole in this scenario.\n\nSister is TA.

Knowing already? Sound a bit suss. NTA", "NTA. Everyone knows not to make big announcements at someone else's social event. What she did was selfish and low class. Just so you know she will try to set up a rivalry between the cousins. Do not let your child get sucked into it. Alex will use her child and your parents to make this happen. Be prepared to either go low contact or cut some or all of them off. It'll start small like who walked 1st, whom said their 1st words sooner then it will go on to reading, writing, sports activities or artistic abilities. Be sure you let your parents know you won't let them subject your child to the comparisons from your sister or them.", "NTA.\n\nCongratulations on your little one!", "I wouldn\u2019t say they totally stood by OP. It seems like they sort of brushed the behavior under the table. Support would look like telling the wife that you understand if she never wants to see the sister at family gatherings again and then accommodating the no contact. Support would look like telling their daughter that her conduct is disgraceful publicly. I suspect that them rushing things under the rug is why she is the way she is.", "NTA\n\nWhat a AH move from your sister. The party was something special to celebrate making it to the end of a incredibly hard road. \n\nYou reacted correctly to your sisters behaviour.\n\nShe is also only a week pregnant, who stands up and confirms that!? Most tests wouldn't pick up on a pregnancy after a week and it's highly unlikely she would have any symptoms. So she is either much further along and made that commitment about \"within the first week of trying\" to hurt you and your wife or she has gone out of her way to find out if was was successful after a week, with the intention of announcing it for this party. She clearly decided this was the perfect opportunity to overshadow your daughters birth. Don't think she expected to be called out.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe \"within a week of trying\" though, unbelievable.", "NTA it's time to go NC with your sister and her toxic narcissism.", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nYour bratty sister needs to be careful with her gloating.  A certain percentage of all pregnancies end in miscarriage.  That's why many women wait until the first trimester is completed before making any announcements.\n\nIgnore your histrionic, immature, bratty sister.\n\nBest wishes to you and your wife for a healthy baby!", "NTA. Bet your sister has a \"miscarriage\" though. Even if she is actually pregnant a) it was not an appropriate time. Thats like announcing at a wedding and b) you'd think after knowing you suffered two miscarriages she'd do what doctors advise and wait 3 months to tell people \n\n(advised bc miscarriage is actually very common before 3 months and telling everyone you told about the baby about the miscarriage can be really traumatic.)"]}
