Be prepared to either go low contact or cut some or all of them off.

Most tests wouldn't pick up on a pregnancy after a week and it's highly unlikely she would have any symptoms. So she is either much further along and made that commitment about \"within the first week of trying\" to hurt you and your wife or she has gone out of her way to find out if was was successful after a week, with the intention of announcing it for this party.

Bet your sister has a \"miscarriage\" though. Even if she is actually pregnant a) it was not an appropriate time. Thats like announcing at a wedding and b) you'd think after knowing you suffered two miscarriages she'd do what doctors advise and wait 3 months to tell people \n\n(advised bc miscarriage is actually very common before 3 months and telling everyone you told about the baby about the miscarriage can be really traumatic.)", "Congratulations on the good news of your upcoming baby.

You handled the issue very well.", "NTA, so let me get this straight, your sister got pregnant within a week of trying, when you normally find out 6 weeks after conception?

But the other friend\u2018s wife disclosed how she saw her in the same clinic and how she knew both took the same treatment to get pregnant from the same ob gyn.

Either way she *chose* to lie at your wife's baby shower, and that is so damned low.\n\nI honestly hope she's lying about being pregnant, she is clearly not emotionally mature enough to raise a child.\n\nI wish you, your wife, and your precious little one all the best!", "NTA.

You do not hijack other people's events to make your own announcement. No matter the announcement or the event. It's not cool and will always plant you in the Ahole spot.
