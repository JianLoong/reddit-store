Not an excuse, but more of an explanation as to why I had a reaction like I did when I did. Maybe I should have waited for her to leave, I accept that. I also accept that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have assumed that he knew my boundaries. But it was never an issue before this happened and I just didn\u2019t think to bring it up to him. I also think everyone is missing the part where she hardly ever showers and lets her dogs do their business inside the house and doesn\u2019t bother to clean it up and then she walks around with her bare feet. If you guys want pee and poop in your beds, be my guest. However, I don\u2019t. \n\n\nSo, on Halloween weekend, my boyfriend\u2019s mom came over to watch scary movies with him and she spent the night. Whatever, I didn\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t even going to be there. I was going to be at my mom\u2019s house for my sister\u2019s birthday. Anyway, I came home the next morning and my my boyfriend\u2019s mom is sleeping in our bed. I got extremely upset because to me, our room is our private area, and no one should be sleeping in the same bed that we f*** in. I woke him up and asked him what she was doing in our bed. He said \u201cI let her sleep there because she\u2019d be more comfortable.\u201d We got into a heated argument about it. She came out of our room and I didn\u2019t say anything to her about it, just exchanged pleasantries. I tried my best to hide the fact that I was upset, but she apparently heard me talking to my boyfriend about it and then when I let my dog out she asked him about it. He told her what I said, and she got extremely mad at me. After she left, she messaged me and told me basically she wanted me out of her life and I have no class. Of course, my boyfriend is on her side, and apparently his friends are too. According to them all, I\u2019m TA. My boyfriend thinks I got upset because it\u2019s his mother, which isn\u2019t true. I\u2019d be mad if anyone was sleeping in our room. He didn\u2019t even ask me about it first. My boyfriend\u2019s mom is also extremely dirty. She hardly ever showers and allows her dogs to use the bathroom in the house and doesn\u2019t clean it up. Then she walks around in bare feet. I don\u2019t want that in my bed.

Having boundaries about your bed is perfectly fine. But since you share the bed with your boyfriend, that isn't just your bed, it's yours and his bed. That means you need to communicate what your boundaries about said bed are, and you both need to agree to it, or otherwise find a compromise that makes you both happy. \n\nYou cannot just expect him to know that allowing his mother to sleep in his bed was going to make you lose your marbles. And no, it's not a common boundary to have. Lots of couples who don't have a guest room, have the habit of letting their parents take up their bedroom and bed when they are visiting, for example. And most of them aren't actively thinking \"that is bed where I eff\", that's actually pretty weird, but you do you. \n\nSo you freaking out, waking your boyfriend up and starting a fight with him about his mother being on the bed, while she was still in the house, was an AH move.

I don\u2019t love that your BF shared what you said with his mom, but you already took a risk that she would hear. I suggest you and your Bf have a calm conversation about bed sharing moving forward\u2014one that doesn\u2019t focus on his mom specifically but in all guests.
