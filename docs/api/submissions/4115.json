I\u2019ve never been involved or invited to family gatherings (in fact I was specifically excluded). Instead, his ex(mother of his 3 year old daughter) was always at the parties and dinners. Most of the time my fianc\u00e9 and his son wouldn\u2019t attend because he didn\u2019t think it was right that they blacklisted me for no reason, without ever meeting me and just saying horrible things about me. He\u2019s been to a couple of the gatherings - his grandfather\u2019s birthday and also dropped his son off for his birthday party with that side of the family. Each time there was an invitation to an event it said \u201c(sons name) and you ONLY\u201d or \u201c(myself) is NOT welcomed here\u201d\n\nFast forward to just last week - I\u2019m 6 months pregnant and even though they have been absolutely terrible to me I sent a baby shower invitation to his step mom, mom, and grandmother because I didn\u2019t want to exclude them from their own grand baby\u2019s shower(and maybe a little bit of spite). \n\nThis weekend my fianc\u00e9 received a text and that read \u201cChristmas Eve here. Bring (me), or (ex) or both\u201d. Although I appreciated being included this time, I am absolutely distraught that they think it\u2019s okay to invite their sons fianc\u00e9, AND his ex, or honestly invite his ex at all\u2026he says it\u2019s because they want to see his daughter too, which I understand;but HE is her father and should be able to take her himself just as any normal family with parents who aren\u2019t together would do. And just as his son\u2019s mother and him arrange. \n\nI\u2019m debating on even going at all. His ex doesn\u2019t like me to begin with and I feel like this is all just going to be miserable if I have to be around a whole family of people who\u2019ve been so terrible to me. PLUS his ex who has done nothing but try to ruin our relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset even though I\u2019m included this time?\n\nWill I be the asshole if I skip the party and only go to my side of the family\u2019s get together?\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I never met him until after him and his ex had been broken up. Talked for 3 months before pursuing a legitimate relationship. A 4 month gap from the time of him and his ex breaking up to the time we became an \u201cofficial\u201d couple. A 1 month gap from the time they broke up before I even met him.", "created_utc": 1670337953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze8kx5/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_fianc\u00e9s_ex_was/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mention he has a son and a daughter. From your post it seems that they have different mothers.\nI'm asking because I have two friends who kept getting excluded from events hosted by their partners' families. In both cases it had nothing to do with my friends, but with their partners' families being tired of constantly being introduced to someone new (both partners had been married multiple times previously) and wanting to wait and see whether it would last before they allowed someone new into their lives.", "This many be unpopular but I have to say NAH. Normally I\u2019m against partners being excluded from family gatherings but I can\u2019t ignore the math. Your fianc\u00e9 is only 33 and he has two kids with two different women and now you and your child will be the third. He\u2019s only been with you for a year and you\u2019re already 6 months pregnant. Plus he started dating you one month after breaking up with the mother of his second child. My theory is that your fianc\u00e9 has been kind of reckless in his relationships and his family didn\u2019t want to meet you because they didn\u2019t want to validate that behavior. \n\nI also think it\u2019s important to note that you\u2019ve never spoken to these people so all you know about their feelings towards you is what your fianc\u00e9 is telling you. I think it would serve you well to go to this gathering and meet his family so you can get confirmation of what\u2019s really been going on.", "You're part of a crazy rushed relationship. 6 months pregnant in a relationship that is barely more than 1 year going and he was still with another person about a year and a half ago. It is no wonder that his family doesn't accept you since they have whiplash from everything going on. Can't blame them for seeing the mother of the grandchild as part of the family when it has been such a short time since the breakup. Especially if (?) she takes care of the grandchild most of the time.\n\nNAH - You can live that way if you want, but you can't expect other to just accept you that quickly. It is a mess of your (you and your fiance) own making. You're still new to his family, despite all the major life-altering choices.", "Why would you want to be baby momma #3?? The other mothers are always going to be part of your life now.", "You are engaged and six months pregnant with a guy with two other baby mama situations. Maybe the family is responding more to him and his dubious choices. It's not really about you.  They have to take him in, he's family.", "Youre going to need to say more about what theyve done that is so \u201chorrible and terrible\u201d. Because it sounds like they just haven\u2019t been terribly welcoming to you, and truthfully, I can see why. It appears your fianc\u00e9 already has two children with two different women. Now he\u2019s knocked you up after a short relationship. Odds are that you won\u2019t be around for very long.\n\nThey\u2019re probably pretty disgusted with him. Someone needs to sit him down and explain to him that he needn\u2019t impregnate everyone he dates. Hand him a box of condoms, give him the name of a good urologist who does a nice vasectomy. I know you think your love is special, but more likely you\u2019ll end up one of the exes his new pregnant girlfriend will be arguing about over Christmas someday.\n\nIn other words, you have bigger fish to fry. You\u2019re going to be a mother. Who gives a shit if the ex is there? She\u2019s with her toddler daughter, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not interested in your boyfriend. You can\u2019t walk into a relationship with a man with multiple women he\u2019s created children with and expect a clean slate. His family has relationships with the mothers of his kids, and that\u2019s a very good thing. That\u2019s what is important, not your fragile ego.\n\nYTA. You are focused on the wrong thing. In a few short months there\u2019s going to be a baby you are responsible for raising. Based on your fianc\u00e9\u2019s track record, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be doing that as a single parent at some point. Doesn\u2019t look good that he\u2019s got you pregnant a year after leaving the last relationship he created a child in. You\u2019d better get prepared.", "YTA. \n\nIf I was your in laws I really wouldn't be all that keen meeting a third woman who he brings home pregnant.\n\nA year is an absolutely ridiculous short time to be engaged and bringing a third child into a situation were he has one child full time, a second child with going by you a high conflict ex. \n\nIt shows he doesn't have good emotional maturity and pretty poor decision making to be honest. \n\nSo now he has 3 baby mothers to manage a new child in the mix with a toddler he has inconsistent access to. A partner who also has no relationships with his family and is already talking about the new child having no contact with his family. Unlike his other children.\n\nIt has all the things needed to be a great success of a blended family! \n\nIt seems the inlaws see her to keep a relationship with their grandchild. They aren't doing anything wrong seeing her.\n\nYour statement about how other seperated parents do things normally also is fairly short sighted. Lots of extended families keep in contact with ex partners. Lots of ex partners spend some holiday time together with their children.\n\nSeperated families do lots of make up of relationships.", "NTA but like so many posters here, you\u2019re not seeing the big picture. Your boyfriend is 33 & will very shortly have 3 kids with 3 different women. You haven\u2019t been together for even 2 years & you\u2019re already having a kid. His family doesn\u2019t see you as special because they see you as just the next baby momma. That isn\u2019t a judgment on you or on them. It\u2019s a judgment on your boyfriend & you should pay attention to his track record.  What makes you think he\u2019s going to treat you any better or stay with you any longer than the last two women who had kids with him? Stop worrying about his family. They\u2019re not the AH here. Your boyfriend is. Worry about how you\u2019re going to take care of yourself & your baby.", "YTA and you also seem incredibly naive about what it means to marry a man with two previous kids. \n\nYour fiance's family consider his ex, the mother of his child, family. It's pretty common actually, a friend of mine divorced her husband and his huge catholic family made it crystal clear that as the mother of the children she would always be family and always have a spot at the table at all holidays and a standing invitation just as if the divorce had never happened. And if any new girlfriends/wife's came along they could either accept it or kick rocks. My friends ex was not thrilled at the prospect having to spend Christmas with his ex but from what I can tell no one cared about his opinion.\n\nSo yes, YTA, his ex is not just his ex. She is and will always be family, and you should learn to co-exist since this is what you are signing up for when marrying him.", "Info: What reasons does his family give for not liking you or wanting to include you?", "Go to the gathering with an open mind. \n\nIn five years, you may he a lot closer to the ex (momma #2) than to the guy.", "They want the grandkids (both born and not yet born) and are willing to include moms in the invite. I can see them including their grandkid's mother, even after they've broken up, but do not understand why they would explicitly exclude you.\n\nThey have three options, don't see the grandkids on holidays, invite mom with the grandkids (no matter what they feel about mom) or try to separate a mom and her small children on a holiday. They've chosen the second.\n\nYou and your fiancee need to decide together what to do about this, but whatever the two of you decide, NTA.", "NTA. BUT...hear me out, this is likely to be very unpopular...\n\nFamily Dynamics tend to have challenges, even the best, most mentally healthy families go through drama.\n\nBased on what you describe, how they've treated you is unfair and disappointing. Who knows what they've been told and what they believe about you, there is definitely something going on behind closed doors as to why they think this way about you. \n\nPatience is a pain in the ass to say the least, when I was younger I would have pounced at the opportunity to find out what the hell is going on. Now with the benefit of being older I can look back and say hmm okay, I need to play the waiting game with this one and be super patient because any little thing I do wrong will have a disproportionate negative effect. You are having a child with this man which means for the rest of your life his family will be engaged with you, how you play with them is critical to what your life is going to look like... It can improve slowly or it can completely blow up.\n\nI recommend this, they obviously really enjoy the ex, okay, swallow that, you are with your boyfriend and you are having his child. Go for Christmas Eve and tell your fiance to invite his ex as well, this is a test, do you hear me? This is a TEST!! If the ex is not invited it will be all on you.\n\nGo for Christmas Eve, you're only mission is to stay neutral and to survive the event. This is your chance to let them see you are a nice woman who loves their son. You don't have to be best friends with the ex, however since she is so well entrenched with this family, you might want to make the effort to have polite interactions with her. You haven't mentioned why the two of you don't get along, whatever the issue is put it aside and just focus on minimal polite conversation with everybody... That's a lovely sweater, did you make this It tastes delicious, this artwork, curtains, whatever is lovely. Find something to genuinely praise without seeming fake. Don't force conversation with anybody, practice your resting face so that you have a small smile, I'm guilty of resting b**** face when I'm just thinking, so I practice having a neutral slightly smiling face when I'm with others.\n\nMany people will likely say this is BS and you should tell your fiance to tell his ex to stay home and tell his family to accept you. That is one path for sure, however what we know about most family dynamics is the minute you tell somebody to do something they resist and often go in the opposite direction.\n\nOvertime you will have opportunities for more interactions with them, never give them any ammunition to use against you, stay neutral and polite at all times regardless of what they do to you. Eventually something will come out, then you and your fiance can figure out how to deal with it", "INFO: You\u2019re engaged after a year and the family specifically excludes you from coming over. Were you the other woman?", "INFO: Is there a possibility your fianc\u00e9 has misrepresented the situation to you? And the exclusion has nothing to do with you and was because your fianc\u00e9 always falls hard and fast? And they wanted to make sure this relationship was more permanent because they didn't want to confuse the kids? To give you a comparison my partner's family only started always addressing me +him in invitations for Easter, Christmas, birthdays, family photos etc after the 2 year mark. Neither of us have kids and we're both about to turn 30. I was invited to events that weren't Christmas after 1 year but welcomed on a bigger level when it was clear that I wasn't going anywhere any time soon. Your fianc\u00e9 wanted you included from day 1, it seems fair to assume he's treated all his other gfs the same. Which isn't a bad quality. But most families will prioritise kids. So for the kids, it might be confusing for them to be introduced to a new gf so soon after the split, especially if it makes their mother uncomfortable. So his family ask that you not attend.\n\nNow the situation has changed. Your relationship has lasted more than a year, you're engaged, you're pregnant. You'll be connected to this family for the rest of your child's life. So now they're treating you like they treat the other mothers of their grandkids. Honestly I would go because it sounds like there's a huge possibility your fianc\u00e9 has misrepresented his family to you. You might want to find out for yourself what's up. There's a high chance is family is shocked and annoyed at your fianc\u00e9 for planning child number 3 so soon into your relationship when they're already having to help him navigate the relationship with the mothers of his first 2 kids.", "YTA", "YTA, your fiance has a track record of impregnating women and not staying in the relationship. You're naive to think you are somehow special and different than the other women and he's going to stay with you. His parents are trying to maintain a relationship with their grandchildren and unfortunately that includes baby mama #1 and #2. When you enter a relationship with someone who already has children, you have to accept that the child's other parent comes along with that in some capacity.

Make sure they know the facts from your fiance. \n\nIt's not wrong for them to want to still have a relationship with the mother of their granddaughter, but it is wrong for them to exclude you and even to include you AND her at the same events. That said, this is your chance to be the bigger person. You'll never get past this contentious relationship if you don't show up when given a small opening to do so.", "NAH.  I can understand your feeling towards his ex, but at the same time you have to understand that she is the mother of one of his families grandchildren, and from the sound of it also has custody of the child.  They may be inviting her to keep the peace so they can have a good relationship with their grandchild.  My wife\u2019s family has swallowed their words more than once over my SIL\u2019s behavior so we can have a relationship with our niece and nephew.  She has more kept us away from them for months because she was called out over her behavior.  His family may just be keeping the peace with her to maintain the relationship.  \n\nOn the other hand, your fianc\u00e9 seems to be firmly I. Your corner over the situation. He supports you by not participating in the events over their behavior.

Your fianc\u00e9 is firmly on your side and that is what matters.  \n\nTake their invitation and be the bigger person so that you can continue to build the relationship with his family.   My one suggestion is to use your husband as buffer to his ex.  Don\u2019t let her draw you into a situation that can have dramatic consequences.  She may try to start something to get you to react and then play the victim.  Continue to be the bigger person and that will make her even madder.
