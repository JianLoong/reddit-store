It was a year long relationship. She was devastated and refused to go to work for a week, she was moping around for ages and refused to talk about it and became completely emotionally unavailable for weeks. My brother (8m) had been in a small accident (nothing really big, just fractured his tibia in a rugby match) and i (26f) had been visiting him at home because he was really upset about it since he couldn't play for a while. Because of this, i wasn't able to spend as much time studying for finals, wasn\u2019t able to take time for myself (i also work a small job after school) and i was getting really stressed. I needed to talk to my friend about it- it had been two months since the breakup at this point. However, she told me she had things of her own to deal with and couldn't talk to me. I was really upset and asked her if she wanted me to recommend a therapist- i was in the process of switching therapists due to mine moving, etc, and that\u2019s why i was talking to my friend instead of my therapist. Plus sometimes its nice to talk to a friend. My friend said no and that she didn't have enough money at the moment. I interpreted this to mean that she wanted to but couldn't afford it \n\nFor christmas, i thought maybe i should get her some free therapy sessions. I got her three with a therapist my sister.\nHowever, when i gifted them to her she started screaming at me, saying it was breaching her boundaries, saying it was completely out of place. Honestly, I'm not sure.. i thought i did it in good intent but maybe she\u2019s right? Its been a bit over a week and she refuses to talk to me. I feel really guilty but still feel like i wasn\u2019t really in the wrong? Please help me, i just don\u2019t know what to think\n\n\nEdit: i wrote this wrong, my sister recommended a therapist- it was not her\n\nEdit 2: i was only talking to my friend bc i was in the process of switching therapists- mine was moving and said she was going to be unavailable.

If I were your friend, I'd probably not speak to you for a good long while... if ever.", "YTA. You crossed a line. You don\u2019t decide for a friend that they\u2019re going to therapy. Therapy is a personal choice. You asked your friend if she wanted you to recommend a therapist and she declined. It doesn\u2019t matter what reason she gave; *she said no*. That doesn\u2019t mean that you double down and choose a therapist for her. You should keep those sessions for yourself to figure out why you think people\u2019s boundaries don\u2019t apply to you.", "YTA. \"You're broken. I've bought something to fix you\" is not a gift. You could have given her money if you really thought that that was her only problem. (And let's be honest- you knew it was about more than money.)", "You don't get to decide whether or not someone needs to do therapy. Therapy is a choice. Therapy isn't a Christmas present. Also where are you parents in all of this? Why weren't they taking care of your brother?", "YTA \n\nThat was passive aggressive and rude.", "YTA. You gifted her healthcare. That\u2019s so invasive and you completely ignored her boundaries. \n\nWhy? Well, because YOU needed therapy and she wasn\u2019t there for you to talk at when your therapist wasn\u2019t. She laid a healthy boundary at that time and said she couldn\u2019t be your therapy because she was dealing with her own issues. You got pissed off. And you passively aggressively gifted her therapy because she couldn\u2019t be yours when your little brother fractured his tibia. \n\nThis was all about you.", "YTA that's not a gift it's a slap in the face", "Info: are you saying the therapist was your sister?", "The only reason I would say YTA is because I think gifting someone therapy sessions as a Christmas present is not cool at all.", "Okay... so this is actually a conversation I had with my sister yesterday. I need therapy. I know that. However I don't want therapy (anxiety and other stuff) and my sister suggested gifting me a voucher for a therapist she used for my birthday in a few weeks time. Now... i didn't flip out because thats just not the kind of person I am and I know her heart was in the right place and she cares about me.. But I will admit that I consider it a shitty gift. So unfortunately YTA since not only did you basically push it onto her, but it's offensive that you decided that was the best gift for her at Christmas.", "YTA. First of all, you don't go around gifting therapy sessions. Second, you sound mostly upset that you could not offload you emotional stress on your friend because she had emotional stress of her own. \n\n(Yes, I think it's normal to talk to friends about issues instead of a therapist, but they need to he available. Friends are not just for good timey stuff.)", "As a mental healthcare provider, I'm going to say a gentle YTA.\n\nIt's clear that you have good intentions here. Your friend's reaction -- screaming at you -- sounds over the top. But I see why she's upset.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this is a major boundary issue -- whether to attend therapy is a personal choice.\n\nOne additional consideration: while a few sessions of therapy can be helpful for relatively minor concerns (and it is possible that navigating a breakup could be one of them), it is also possible to delve into some topics in therapy that require more than three sessions to work through. There is a risk in starting therapy, opening up some old (or fresh) wounds, but not having the money to continue past three sessions to really work through those challenges. It's one thing if a person decides themselves to attend just three sessions of therapy (or if their problems can genuinely be addressed in a few sessions). It is another if a person feels pressured to start therapy but then has to stop before they ideally would because they don't have the funds to continue past a few sessions.", "YTA. \n\nThat is not something you gift someone for the holidays. That's soemthing you discuss with them, and come to a solution together about, if they even want your help. \n\nI'd be pissed if someone gave me that, unless it was a real discussion before hand and I told them it was okay.", "YTA. It is definitely overlapping boundaries. It is extremely presumptive of you. And a therapist is a personal choice. \n\nAlso, not clear on what triggered it when it sounds like you were the one needing to talk:  \n\n>However, she told me she had things of her own to deal with and couldn't talk to me. I was really upset and asked her if she wanted me to recommend a therapist", "YTA. It sounds like **you** need more therapy time if you're stressed and \"needed\" to vent to your friend, but she told you \"had things of her own to deal with and couldn't talk to me.\"  Try listening to people instead of insisting on your needs being met.", "Reddit, AITA for trying to force medical care upon my friend to expedite her grieving process so that I can have a person to vent at again? YTA", "YTA - Therapy is something very personal. Also, as a therapist myself, one of the first things i consider is what expectation has the client towards me (being a woman, being my age). So, yeah, choosing a therapist for someone else isn't a very good idea for the therapy itself (also for all what other people said before).", "YTA. Like others have said, therapy is deeply personal. You don't get to just assume people want it. If you wanted to get her therapy appointments for Christmas, you should have directly asked if that's something she wanted.", "YTA that is not a gift and it is rude. You definitely overstepped boundaries.", "Gentle YTA - Personally, as someone who needs and wants therapy but can\u2019t afford it at the moment, I\u2019d love some free therapy sessions. But that is a very personal choice; you heard her say \u201cno\u201d and \u201cshe can\u2019t afford it\u201d and assumed that meant that the only reason she hasn\u2019t gone is because of money. Assuming these things without knowing her feelings about it *exactly* can blow up in your face, as it has here.\n\nShould she have screamed at you? Probably not, but it did come across as disrespectful and crossing a boundary she set with you, and given everything else going on, I do understand her snapping in frustration. And did you say the therapist was your sister? That seems rather inappropriate and like a conflict of interests.\n\nDon\u2019t involve yourself in such personal choices like this for someone else unless they give you *explicit* permission to do so.", "Yta. Not only is trying to use your friend as a substitute for a therapist not cool, but trying to \"gift\" therapy to someone unsolicited is rude as hell. Therapy is not something someone else can choose for you. It is a very personal process and its entirely uncalled for to intrude upon the process or try to force it on someone regardless of if you think you had good intentions.", "YTA, I'm afraid. You did this because of what you needed from your friend. Not _for_ your friend.", "You basically told your friend they where messed in the head and needed professional help - simply because you couldn\u2019t have a bitch session with them. And after they told you they didn\u2019t want to seek therapy. \n\nYTA.", "Gentle YTA\n\nDid I read right that you got her therapy sessions with your sister? That's a little intrusive- don't you think?  I think you had nice intentions but therapy isn't a gift. Chocolate is a gift. Therapy is Healthcare. Would you give your friend an inhaler for Christmas? \n\nIt sounds like your friend had a bit of an explosive reaction, but she had a right to be put off by this.", "Soft YTA. Your heart was in the right place but I'm not sure where your brain was. Choosing a therapist, even making the decision to go into therapy, is a very personal decision and one that only your friend can make. What if your friend prefers their therapist to be the gender opposite of what you chose, or prefers the therapist to specialize in one thing or another? These are not choices you can make for your friend, and these choices are necessary for therapy to be successful. I often say \"Oh I can't afford that right now\" when I'm looking for a polite excuse to turn someone down and change the subject - I would be mortified if someone \"gifted\" me therapy sessions for Christmas because they 1. thought I needed it and 2. thought I couldn't take care of it myself. There is no right or wrong way to get over the loss of a relationship, your friend just needs to work it out on her own time. Pressuring her to get over it faster by any means necessary because it doesn't fit your schedule and your needs is not helpful.", "Yta", "Gentle YTA.\nIntent was good but it really wasn\u2019t your place. Imagine how you would feel if someone said to you \u201cyou really need therapy\u201d. Not something most would take lightly", "YTA. First off the root of you wanting to get her therapy sessions was so she would again become available for you to talk to. Not out of concern for her well-being. Break ups are hard, and you don\u2019t know the dynamics of the relationship or why it ended. It sounds like your friend is extremely depressed, a lot of people isolate when grieving and grief doesn\u2019t stop just because you think it\u2019s been enough time(it\u2019s been 2 months at this point) The language you\u2019re using to describe the situation feels hostile as well. \u201cShe *refused* to go into work\u201d \u201c she was moping around for ages\u201d \u201c *refused* to talk about it\u201d \u201c she became completely emotionally unavailable for weeks\u201d it sounds like you have no sympathy for your friend and that you are also putting a time frame on when you think she should feel better. Also it sounds like you lack respect for her boundaries . She didn\u2019t want to talk about it. That\u2019s her boundary. Not only that, but it continues to show that you have no idea what happened or what she could be going through right now. You shouldn\u2019t rely on her or expect her to be there for you just because you want her to be. If you don\u2019t have other friends to talk to that\u2019s not her fault. \n\nEdit: I do hope everyone in the situations physical/mental health is ok and gets better. I don\u2019t think you had bad intentions but I do think you have unrealistic expectations of your friend and lack respect of her boundaries", "YTA, if the person doesn't want to go to therapy you can't force them and it shows that you don't respect them.", "NTA - I don't think you're an asshole as you were trying to help, but therapy is such a personal thing that the choice should be left to the person that would be the patient.  Her reasoning may have just been an excuse because she may not be comfortable with therapy at this time. \n\nI'd suggest reaching out to your friend and explaining that you misunderstood and thought that they said no due to the cost, but that you realize you should have asked before moving forward with that gift.", "I think I\u2019ll say ESH.  Here\u2019s why:\n\nThe obvious is that getting someone therapy sessions for Christmas\u2026 well, say it out loud to yourself.\n\nHer reaction though nearly validated the idea that she probably indeed, need therapy for Christmas.  You clearly meant the best, she responded by screaming her face off and then giving you the silent treatment.\n\nAnyway, yeah sorry for the lame Christmas.", "NAH just because I think your heart was in the right place but therapy sessions aren\u2019t a Christmas gift. This is something you needed to ask her if she wanted.", "No one is worth moping over for this long, your friend has issues and she would benefit from seeing a therapist to learn how to deal with this kind of stuff. I don't think screaming was her best way to response (that was an asshole thing to do), but obviously she took it the wrong way.

Will this bring a smile to their face? Will this gift replace something broken? Is this gift something they asked for?\" \nIf you cannot answer yes to any of those questions, DO NOT PURCHASE said item!!\nTry to think of this from her perspective.

Absolutely not.\nSo while your heart may have been in the right place by trying to help her heal, you are kind of TA in this situation.", "Listen, I get your intentions. You thought your friend couldn\u2019t afford (mental) healthcare and you wanted to help. I\u2019m someone who believes that everyone belongs in therapy, but that\u2019s not our choice to make. A few considerations:\n\n- When she said no and she doesn\u2019t have the money, realize that sometimes people put forth excuses because they\u2019re not comfortable just refusing. They feel they need to offer explanation, and that\u2019s an easy one. It may not have been about the money at all. \n\n- Choosing a therapist is harder than dating, imo. You need someone who understands your values and who you feel comfortable being extremely honest with (and that\u2019s without insurance and pricing and availability considerations on top of it). You can\u2019t choose a therapist for your friend anymore than you can pick their next partner or job or primary care physician. It\u2019s a personal choice. \n\n- I realize you want what\u2019s best for your friend, but you also seem to be thinking of this as what\u2019s best for you. There\u2019s not anything wrong with considering your needs (and we\u2019ve all known someone who probably should be in therapy), but that\u2019s not a gift for her then. It\u2019s a gift for you.", "Allow me to clarify:\n\nYou tried to force therapy onto someone \"as a gift\" because [checks notes] they were too busy dealing with their own shit to be a shoulder for YOU to cry on?\n\nYTA. If you need to cry to someone, why don't YOU see a therapist and leave your poor friend alone?", "This is like gifting someone a gym membership lmao. YTA.\n\nPS she didn't express interest, she expressed polite disinterest.", "YTA. I understand you didn\u2019t intend to be an AH, but therapy is a gift that should only be gifted if asked for.", "YTA - you don\u2019t care about your friends mental health you just care about her availability to be of use to you. Not only was it rude and passive aggressive, it was selfish and lacking in any self awareness or decency.\n\n\nGet over your shit already I need to talk about me! YTA", "It's okay to reach out to a friend for support as long as you respect her boundary if she says she's not available. Therapy is not something you gift someone unless they ask for it. It's like buying someone a diet plan, gym membership, or plastic surgery. You told her there was something wrong with her that she needed to fix. YTA.", "You know YTA lol", "YTA if someone had done this to me i would be really offended and upset. Not an appropriate gift at all.", "NTA i wish someone would gift me therapy for xmas can we be friends", "Seriously, even if a friend directly told you they had to give up their existing beloved therapist because of budget issues and were stressed about that, you STILL wouldn't gift them sessions. You'd give them the money and let them decide where to spend it.", "They were, but they have work a lot of the time and i offered to come around a bit- especially since we have rlly close relationship", "Exactly this, she has the maturity to understand her emotional bandwidth and made a healthy boundary accordingly.\n\nYTA", "No, just one she used to use", "Oh and it was sessions with your sister?(not sure if I read that right...) This would be even weirder and make it worse for me.", ">You clearly meant the best,\n\nI think a lot of ppl would disagree with you. First off, when asked about her interest in seeing a therapist, OP said that the friend said no *and* that she coudn't afford it right now. If she had just mentioned the money issue, I could see why OP came to the conclusion. But it sounds like there was also a clear no, in which case OP is completely out of bounds for disrespecting that. Sometimes ppl give multiple reasons behind a refusal; OP shoudn't have focused solely on the money part. \n\nSecond, gifting therapy sessions could also be seen as a condescending, depending on perceived intent. For the friend, who seems to have said she wasn't interested in therapy, getting sessions given to her anyway would most likely have her believe that OP thought she wasn't capable of making that decision for herself, or thought she was doing so horribly that she needed the therapy sessions anyway. Especially if OP's only reason for buying them was bc the feiend said she was dealing with her own needs and couldn't be there to emotionally support OP at the moment. That's a pretty normal thing for ppl to experience, and certainly nothing about that screams \"this person meeds therapy!\"\n\nThirdly, if I'm reading this right, it sounds like this happened maybe a month ago? OP says the breakup was 2 or 3 months ago, and when OP called her friend she said it was 2 months after the breakup, so I think the conversation happened last month? Maybe early this month? If I'm right, then to give someone therapy sessions a month after they said they were dealing with things is just weird. Does OP even know if it was a temporary thing she was dealing with, or if she got over it by now? Has OP kept up with the friend's emotional state to see if the therapy sessions were still a \"good idea?\" Does OP even know if the friend was just upset about the breakup or if something else was going on at the same time? Was it a messy breakup? Were mutual friends and/or family involved and exacerbating the situation?\n\n>she responded by screaming her face off and then giving you the silent treatment.\n\nEh, dunno if I trust OP about the screaming-this is someone who thinks her friend needs therapy just bc she wasn't emotionally available for OP one time-not sure I can trust the judgement of someone like that. Could be that the friemd had just raised her voice or let her tone express how upset she was and OP is relaying that as screaming.", "Yeah same here!!!", "You chose to do that.", "Still YTA. She said no. This isn't the type of gift you give someone unless they've clearly said they want it. It's like giving an obese person a book on dieting they didn't ask for.", "Any therapist that allows people to purchase healthcare from them in the form of gift certificates should not be a therapist. \n\nNot only is it healthcare, it\u2019s difficult, painful and deeply personal - it\u2019s not like a gift certificate for a massage. The therapeutic relationship also depends on the patient feeling comfortable with a therapist - selling multiple sessions puts pressure on a patient to continue past the point of discovering they aren\u2019t compatible or comfortable. \n\nEven if your friend wanted to see a therapist, and asked you for a recommendation, it\u2019s still not suitable as a Christmas gift. If you really want to help a friend you help them when they need help, you don\u2019t make them wait till you stick a bow on it. \n\nYTA. And so is the therapist who helped you.", "Therapy should be personal decision only!", "This was well-intentioned, but clumsily done. The best time to have offered these sessions was when you were already discussing therapy or shortly after. Definitely not to give them to her as a Christmas gift.", "YTA\n\nYour friend has to grieve on their own schedule.\nYou aren't entitled to use them for therapy when you are between therapists. They said they didn't have room, your job as a friend was to respect that. \n\nEncouraging and supporting their process is different from placing your judgement ahead of theirs. You can't select a therapist for someone.  This doesn't feel friendly, it feels patronizing and judgmental.", "therapy sessions as a gift? wow i\u2019d be so offended.", "I think YTA mostly because it seems to be a response to getting your feelings hurt (do you think you were maybe hoping that once she goes to therapy she can support you?) rather than her expressing a desire for something she couldn\u2019t afford, and you helping her out.\n\nWith that said, I would consider getting more friends that are able to support you and be supported by you. I think there\u2019s been a current trend of people entirely offloading the role of social support to therapy. Therapy is important but imo it is not a replacement for having people in your life that can hear you out when shit gets hard. So I don\u2019t think you need to justify going to the friend only because you couldn\u2019t see a therapist. In any case, a boundary is a boundary. So you should/should\u2019ve respected it and directed energy elsewhere.", "Some of these replies are really harsh, and are treating therapy like a weapon or punishment, or something someone only needs if they're 'broken' and need 'fixed' and I honestly need those people to sit down and think about their abelism, because that's some rather cruel language. Examine why you think that, and why you're so against therapy to begin with.   \n\n\nAs for the actual issue, I'm honestly going to go against the angry grain here and say NAH.   \n\n\nTherapy can benefit everyone. You don't need to be 'broken' to benefit from therapy. It sounds like the friend could really use it, and the friend DID say they were too low on money to afford it, so I think the thought of OP giving it to them for free was meant kindly. I personally would have appreciated it.   \n\n\nI can also see why the friend was offended. Therapy is a choice, though there's nothing wrong with suggesting it if you think someone could benefit from it, the way that's suggested should be... delicate. As a Christmas gift, I think it's not the best idea... for Christmas I would be wanting something I WANTED as a gift, not something I needed, if that makes sense. It also comes off really pushy. So I totally understand why they were offended.  \n\n\nNAH, I think the friend overreacted but OP handled this poorly.   \n\n\nBut all these comments cruelly saying therapy is 'a slap in the face' I don't think are it, either."]}
