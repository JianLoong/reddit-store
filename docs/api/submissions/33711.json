It would be one thing if you desperately needed his assistance with hands-on care but it sounds like you're just waiting this out in bed. Does his presence really make a difference to you?

How many times has he had to do this before, since this sounds like a fairly regular issue for you?

In my decade of experience, I've found that what makes migraines better is darkness, silence, stillness, and sleep. My friends and family who have migraines agree. So why on earth do you need your husband with you the entire time? The easiest way to control all of those factors is to be alone. You even said that getting out of bed and spending time with him is an effort.

It definitely sounds like everything has to revolve around OP even at the detriment of her husband, her argument isn't even that he left her without water/food/medication just that he left at all. \n\nOrdinarily I'd have more sympathy for people who are ill/disabled but there's so little empathy from the OP towards their husband on a holiday that they'd end up spending alone twiddling their thumbs and waiting to be called upon.", "I get migraines and I would love it if everyone vacates to house so it is totally quiet.  You don\u2019t have to lay there in agony and be tense wondering when the next noise is going to come and is it going to be loud and you end up throwing up. I have literally give family members money to got see a movie and eat at a restaurant to get them to leave.\n\nSeriously though what medicine are you on to help with the migraines?  There is one that you can get at the Dr.s office that is placed in the nose (haven\u2019t tried it).  I get Botox for them and then I take Nurtec ODT when I feel one coming on, it also makes me sleepy.  I lay down in a dark room and absolute quiet fall asleep for 3-4 hours and my migraine is gone.\n\nESH,  I don\u2019t understand why it bothered you for him to leave for hours and then you kick him out for days.", "Well said", "I think the way you and your husband handled similar situations is awesome! That's a sign of a healthy relationship.", "I agree. Plus, he likely wasn\u2019t even with his family for a full three hours each day since he had to drive to where he was going and then home as well.", " I had similar thoughts. I have migraines too, and they're really not the kind of thing you need a partner to get through. Actually, I prefer to be alone, because the ideal environment for a migraine is darkness, silence/migraine relief music, heat or cold compress, and staying as still as possible. My friends/family who have migraines say the same. Sure, might be nice to have someone bring me some painkillers and a heating pad, but after I'm set up, the main goal is to go to sleep. Having other people nearby just increases potential of noise/jostling/light/etc.\n\nThis sounds more like either OP is just frustrated that she couldn't exert control over her husband, or that there's more information about the whole situation that we're not getting.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You should know that.", "The kicking him out feels more like punishment and control than time to reflect.", "Thank you! The minute I have a migraine, I disappear into my dark bedroom and shut everyone else out.", "This right here!!!  When I have a migraine I want a bed in a completely dark quiet room; nothing and no one else\u2026.", "Same, when a migraine hits me the only reason I want someone around me is if they're going to give me drugs to make the pain stop. Other than that, leave me to die in peace lol", "I agree, I have migraines frequently all I want when I have migraines especially when I am at home when it happens is dark room and be left alone. It's Christmas and he spent 42 hours of the 48 hours with OP and OP thinks that's not enough? Edit to add YTA, OP.", "She's upset over 6 hours, but she's kicking him out for 7 days. Make it make sense.", "The last thing OP should\u2019ve given him is five days to reflect.", ">Maybe he has some Narcissistic tendencies or other human frailty\n\nI'm sorry... what? No, really... What?! Where is that even coming from? Even in her \"I'm super mad at him\" story, OP paints her husband as someone who was as caring as he could have been in this kind of situation.\n\nHoping that he's not a \"big jerk\" is a really weird take. He spent the entire day with OP, even though she clearly stated that spending time with him was difficult due to her migraines. I guess if you think her husband is a \"big jerk\" or a narcissist, you might look at it differently... but most people would probably notice that their significant other is struggling to keep them company. Instead of making her feel like she *had* to keep him company, he gave her a bit of time to rest on her own, and he came back to have dinner with her.\n\nOP might still be suffering as she wrote this, maybe it's clouding her judgment... But kicking her husband out of the house because they spent two afternoons with his family while she was struggling to even leave the bedroom... No, that's simply not a \"soft\" YTA. It's a pretty big one. Hopefully she feels better soon and realizes what she has done. If her husband decides to take it as an opportunity to get out of this kind of one-sided relationship, then he's absolutely not a \"big jerk\". It sounds like he's willing to compromise but OP is not. If he's the only one willing to make the effort, he is absolutely not an asshole for realizing that's simply not sustainable in a marriage.", "It's a migraine, many people deal with it solo or if they have help it's so they can lay in the dark. She didn't need him, it's not that she was unable to see to her own needs. It's that he didn't stay home quietly with her because she wasn't interested in leaving the house. It was only a few hrs, she wasn't dependent on him for care. She's being an ah.", "12 on and off for a day. They exhaust me. We are all different though.", "Yep. How can they be mad at the husband being gone then the solution is - \u201cthe husband being gone more\u201d?? Doesn\u2019t make sense", "Double standards", "I prefer to have a partner near me when I have a bad migraine. In part because I'm a single mom and have teen kids with trauma, C-ptsd, and anxiety; so knowing another adult is in the house helps me relax a lot. The other reason is because once the pain of a migraine hits the only thing that helps (other than sleep, which tends to be elusive during a migraine) is someone basically massaging my scalp, playing with my hair, or even tugging on my hair gently. The weird thing is that those things don't work with a tension headache", "While I agree with your judgement about the OP\u2014please keep in mind it\u2019s definitely different for everyone. I have chronic migraines that put me on my ass for days at a time and no medication has helped despite trying med after med\u2014rizatriptan in particular will stay on my shit list until I die bc I swear it made them worse. Darkness and silence helps tons, but when I have them I get very clingy. So I want to lay in total darkness and silence but I also want my fianc\u00e9 near me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s a furnace so the heat from him is nice, his presence is comforting, or what, but I want to be *in his skin* when they happen\u2014I can get through them by myself but it is easier when he\u2019s nearby. So I can very much understand OP wanting her husband there, but I do agree she is very selfish for being upset with him for being with his family for a total of six hours during the Christmas holiday.", "Right? I started getting migraines after having my twins 7 years ago. If it\u2019s such an effort to be in the living room with him why not take those 3 hours in darkness and take a nap with a cool cloth? Something.", "She clarified it's because she had canceled family events that she would have liked to do for his behalf and he didn't do the same for her.", "I am the same way. I have a handful of debilitating health issues. I am in pain, 24/7/365. I am fine alone with it, as long as I'm set up before he does whatever. But when it is a different kind of sickness, pain, or a major flare-up of 1 of my chronic conditions, I want to be near him. When it is bad, it is unbearable. I'm sorry you go through this, and I'm so glad you've found help in this way. Also, 100% agree with you. It's the holidays FFS.", "Wow the difference in how they affect us all is amazing - when I have my migraines, I cannot stand to be spoken to, touched or just around another human being at all. I have a hot bath, take my painkillers and put on my frozen eye mask and just want to be left ALONE until I can move again, usually after a number of hours spent asleep. I love my partner to death but his presence during a migraine makes things worse - even his breathing makes it hurt more!", "Honestly if it was anyone but my fianc\u00e9 I would totally not be okay with them being near me during a migraine, he\u2019s just a really weird exception. I\u2019m sorry you go through this as well, I know from experience that it never gets any easier but I hope the flare ups and pain get less common/frequent.", "Me to! I have paid my family to leave the house and go see a movie and eat out because no matter how hard they try not to make noise, it always happens.", "Oh poor dude speaks to me and it\u2019s curtains for him, I promise you. But he very gently puts his incredibly warm ass hands on my head? It\u2019s one of the very few things that brings the pain from a level 100 to a 98. It\u2019s the only thing that can ease the agony long enough for me to fall asleep (as hot compresses/rags heat fades too quickly) & he only usually stays until I can fall asleep and then he (very quietly, ofc) sneaks out while I sleep. Well, ironically, it\u2019s his warm hands and pregnancy. I noticed both with our first son and now our current pregnancy that while pregnant I don\u2019t have the migraines nearly as often and when I do they are only the \u201cthrowing up because my head hurts so bad\u201d level, which is pretty mild for me thankfully!", "Same. I want HIM or nobody. Lol. Happy holidays. Be well.", "Thank you, you too! :)"]}
