He spent 6 hours with his family over two days. He did not leave you alone while you were sick. Also, you could leave and go stay with someone else, if I were him, and I would reflect on the relationship.", "O.P, YTAH! Wow, he left for a few hours. You had quiet time and could rest, and you are mad and now wanna kick him out of the house, which is his also? Yikes..... thats just messed up big time.", "YTA. As a frequent flier of the headache and migraine club, this makes absolutely *zero* sense to me.\n\nWhen my head hurts, all I want is for people to stay the fuck away from me. Obviously you feel differently, but this man spent all but 6 hours with you.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. Instead of focusing on the 42 hours he was with you on Christmas and Christmas Eve, you're focusing on the 6 hours he wasn't. And to punish him, you're kicking him out of the home for 5 more days. Explain to me how that makes any sense. Because he didn't spend a sum total of 6 hours with you, you're going to make sure he doesn't spend the next 120 hours with you.", "YTA. So  you've been ill for 3 years yet you still expect  you're husband to pander to you 24/7. You sound like a tiring person to be around.", "YTA and pretty selfish. YOU had a migraine and expected him to sit with you and disregard his family because YOU had a migraine and would be having a quiet time the whole time???? Knock it off.", "YTA\n\nUnless you needed hands on care (which doesn't sound like you do since your response is to kick him out), spending 3 hours each day with his family out of 24 hours sounds okay to me.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you are sad that you are unwell over Christmas and taking it out on your husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where all the family get together, I assume it was more than just his parents there - at these events it was a rare chance to catch up with everyone together, reconnect with his family roots, and spend time as a group. Rare. Once a year thing usually. \n\nAnd you plan to divorce him over just this? There must be more going on.", "YTA.", "YTA, he spend give or take 3 hour's with family on both days and the whole rest of it with you.\n\nHad that been me in his position and i be told go stay with my brother for the week, i would not only dead ass go, but i would absolutely turn off all ways for you to reach me and spend quality time with family and use all that time to reflect on our relationship going forward.\n\nBecause trust me once back there would be a high hell of a chance i would absolutely be done.", "YTA! I am sorry but you sound incredibly self-centered. You have had him for the majority of the time.\n\nHim spending a total of 6 hours in two days, is not really that big of a deal. If you had been bed-ridden for the entirety of the time, then your feelings would have been justified but not here. \n\nRe-valuating your relationship sounds too far-fetched because you are the one here at fault and not your husband.", "YTA. You wanted him around more than he already was when you had a migraine, so you are going to... set things right by sending him away? You serious right now? 3 hours per day is not excessive at all. He is allowed to spend time with family and friends. \n\nYou need some emotional regulation skills. This is not the way to keep your marriage.", "YTA.", "YTA and honestly sound selfish for expecting a person to abandon HIS FAMILY for the entirety of christmas. yes, i understand it sucks with chronic illness and pain, but it was 6 hours that i'm sure either slept through or did something else. or maybe you didnt and just sat there, ruminating over everything.  either way, let the man see his family, tis the season and all.", "Gurrrl \u2014let\u2019s talk .You have a disease that may worsen I bet .Your husband probably said \u201c In sickness and in health \u201c not really thinking too hard about what that means .Now you two are in Reality land .You WILL be tempted to leave him because being a good Caretaker is a learned skill .Maybe he has some Narcissistic tendencies or other human frailty.He will not always measure up to being the person you need .He will have to learn to ride herd on himself when you are needy\u2026You need to see Life not just from your \u201c Sick person viewpoint \u201c but from where he sits and breathes .How much is he giving up to be with you ? \n\nYou two married because you love each other .You have hit a major roadblock .If you run him away who will be there for you if things get worse ? Feeling sorry for yourself will help no one .Tell him you are sorry for how you reacted .That you are still learning how to handle this Chapter of your life and that you love him.\n.Hope that he is not really a big jerk who sees you sending him away as his key to getting out of this situation .Gentle YTA.", "YTA. He spent the vast majority of both days at home with you. He shouldn\u2019t have to completely isolate himself from his family. He\u2019s shown you that you are the top priority by spending the most time with you, but he\u2019s allowed to have other people that are important to him.", "YTA - you had a headache, not a dangerous illness that required help.  Most people would be grateful to be left alone when they have a headache... being hydrated and lying in a dark and quiet room by yourself is one of the best remedies.", "YTA. He spent a total of 6 hours over two days with his family and the rest with you.", "YTA", "YTA.\nHe spent time with his family, how selfish are you? \n\n\"Sorry family, I can't come because Susie has a migraine and MIGHT leave the bedroom. Have to make sure I'm right here for quiet time instead of enjoying a holiday with you guys.\" \n\n\nIt was six hours between two days, lady. Get over yourself.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t leave you alone for Christmas. He left for 3 hours. I suffer from migraines so I know how bad they can be. You\u2019re being unreasonable and selfish", "YTA- it was 3 hours.\nYou're extremely selfish. Do not use your illness to justify your self centeredness.  An illness isn't an excuse to be an arse.\n\nApologize to your husband. \n\nI'm sorry you're sick, and it's awful being sick around Christmas,  but do not take it out on your husband who doesn't 3 hours away from you and with his family", "YTA. It would be one thing if you desperately needed his assistance with hands-on care but it sounds like you're just waiting this out in bed. Does his presence really make a difference to you? You described it as \"an effort\" to spend time with him in the living room. So he's just supposed to...sit there quietly while you wait out your migraine? How many times has he had to do this before, since this sounds like a fairly regular issue for you? If he had food poisoning or the flu would you want to just sit around in the bathroom with him for two days while he was too ill to interact with you or really notice your presence? \n\n3 hours per day doesn't seem excessive. He deserves to spend a little time with his family and it's obvious that he still cut that time short to come be with you. You also didn't say anything after the first time he went, so how would he know that you didn't want him to go a second time? You can't kick him out of his own home for a week because *you* failed to communicate properly.", "YTA , Also good thing for him to be away from you. Gives him time to contemplate on his relationship with you.", "OP sounds like the type of person to always count her partner\u2019s mistakes like some sort of authoritatian law enforcement agency. She also sounds like the type who wants her partner\u2019s world to revolve around her. Being her partner sounds exhausting. I would also recommend divorce, but for *his* sake.\n\nYTA, OP."]}
