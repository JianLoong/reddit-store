It would be one thing if you desperately needed his assistance with hands-on care but it sounds like you're just waiting this out in bed. Does his presence really make a difference to you? You described it as \"an effort\" to spend time with him in the living room. So he's just supposed to...sit there quietly while you wait out your migraine? How many times has he had to do this before, since this sounds like a fairly regular issue for you? If he had food poisoning or the flu would you want to just sit around in the bathroom with him for two days while he was too ill to interact with you or really notice your presence? \n\n3 hours per day doesn't seem excessive. He deserves to spend a little time with his family and it's obvious that he still cut that time short to come be with you.

Wow.  I can only assume that your required level of involvement means that everything always focuses on you and your husband should not have any independent thoughts or go anywhere if you can't.

In my decade of experience, I've found that what makes migraines better is darkness, silence, stillness, and sleep. My friends and family who have migraines agree. So why on earth do you need your husband with you the entire time? The easiest way to control all of those factors is to be alone. You even said that getting out of bed and spending time with him is an effort.

You want to be alone, so you leave lmao.", "It\u2019s her brother too like", "Just to support this point, migraine is a complex and debilitating disease that -- among other things -- potentially increases a sufferer's risk of stroke. They can come with a range of symptoms, pre-attack, during attack and post-attack, that can last days. Some migraine attacks don't even include pain, but are still dibilitating because of all the other symptoms they cause.\n\nI personally think the OP has handled this situation completely wrong, but downplaying and misrepresenting what migraines are isn't the way to make that point.", "It's definitely punishment. \"Reflect on your behavior\" is a parent/teacher/religious leader thing to say (usually to a child), not something a partner says to another partner.", "Seriously. When the emotional burden of someone who treats you like that is removed for a few days, that sense of relief has you rethinking a whole lot.", "She could sit in the living room, she just didn't feel up to having meals.\n\nI also don't see where she said he snuck out. It just says he left and the only reason she cares is because it's Christmas and she didn't like being left alone on Christmas not because she needed help.", "That's why we have the INFO tag, friend. \n\nTelling someone to just delay is an AH move for sure, especially when they could have asked. Many diseases do not work like that or take breaks for holidays", "See, having kids in the house would definitely change the situation, but it sounds like OP and her husband are the only ones. \n\nAlso with the head massaging thing--a gentle body massager has worked wonders for me! It's worth investing in one for times when you have to get through a migraine alone."]}
