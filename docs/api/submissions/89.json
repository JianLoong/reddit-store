My friend \"Polly\" wanted to come and visit at the end of next month. We had been talking about this trip and planning dates for ages, and she still hadn't booked anything, which is obviously fine. However, in the meantime I had been having some mental health issues and family drama and would like to go home to my parents around the time she is supposed to visit (it is the only time that my family will be free when flights are affordable for me to go home).\n\nThree days ago I sent Polly a long message explaining the situation and that I was sorry I would not be able to host her at the time we had planned for her to visit. She had still not booked anything at the time but immediately seemed a bit defensive and sent me a message saying, \"This is the only time I will be free to visit you, can I come on [specific dates]? I can book flights today, is that ok?\" I immediately (within 30 minutes) replied saying, \"No, I'm sorry, as I explained I would now like to go home at the time we had been planning the visit, and in any case the first two days of your trip aren't what we discussed and I have always been unable to host you at that time due to [specific commitments]. Normally I would say to book 2 days later but as I said I really need to prioritise my mental health and go home at that time if possible.\"\n\nShe didn't respond again until the next day and told me that she had already booked flights before checking whether I'd replied and that she was expecting me to host her on the dates she had outlined. Tbh I was quite shocked by this and told her I couldn't host her then and that she should have checked my response to her questions before booking the flights. She is now very angry and insisting that I should pay her back for the cost of her flights (around \u00a3100 which is a lot for either of us), but I told her that this shouldn't be my responsibility as she should have double checked with me before spending the money. I later offered to refund half as a peace offering but she said this wasn't anywhere near good enough.\n\nPolly told our mutual friends the situation and they are all saying I'm TA and should pay her back in full as she and her family apparently have no money. I'm devastated to have lost this friendship on top of everything else going on in my life and really confused about whether I'm in the wrong.\n\nSo AITA for cancelling this trip and refusing to refund my friend for her flight tickets?", "created_utc": 1667206119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi5bty/aita_for_cancelling_a_trip_and_refusing_to_pay_my/", "score": 479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So she can go on her holiday at *your* expense.

I feel like she is extorting me by only booking after I told her not to. Why would she wait so long and then book within hours of me saying no except to try to force me to host her? Money is tight for me too at the moment. I know she was looking forward to the holiday, but my mental health and family comes first. I was unaware of her financial trouble and I'm now wondering how she was going to afford food and events here even if she was staying with me. I understand that she has just spent a lot of money on tickets but I specifically told her not to do that. I told her not to, she then asked for dates that I didn't agree to in the first place and asked if that was okay, and then didn't actually check that was okay before she booked. That sounds like manipulation to me?\"", "NTA. I agree with all these comments. Or idk, maybe she didn't really book anything and just wants to get money from you. Try asking her for the flight ticket first before retracting your offer to pay half just to see if she really did book it.
