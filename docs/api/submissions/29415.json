I don't know how old you are, but are you able to do fun things you want to do that your sister might not physically be able to?", "Nta.  While it would be nice to include your sister it seems as though you live your life having to accommodate her.  There are times that you deserve to do what you want.  Most people don\u2019t see how hurtful it can be to always have to put what you want aside so that one person can feel included.  You\u2019re allowed to want to do things that others can\u2019t join in.  See if you can comprise.  Do a hike then do a dinner that includes the entire family.", "I am the parent of a disabled kid and a typical kid. \n\nYou\u2019re not being kind to your parents or your sister. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to want to do things just you and your parents. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your friends. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your grandparents. \n\nBut if you include all of your siblings and your parents and your grandparents, everyone EXCEPT your sister you\u2019re being really mean. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of your parents having to split up or plan around your sister. They will still have to split up or plan care for your sister to do what you want to do. \n\nI hear you that your friends don\u2019t like hiking and I\u2019m sorry to hear that because hiking is a joy. \n\nBut you should pick something you can do for your birthday that you\u2019ll love that everyone can do. For example, maybe google \u201caccessible hikes near me\u201d. There are often many wheelchair and stroller accessible beautiful hikes near you that your family including your sister could go on for your birthday. And bonus - if you choose an accessible hike you can take a wagon to carry your picnic stuff. That means you\u2019d have space to bring a cake on your birthday hike. Because otherwise someone would have to try and hike while carrying a cake which is a recipe for disaster. \n\nHappy birthday.", "Dear OP, to have a family party that excludes one member doesn't quite seem right. Why do you not want her there?", "YTA\n\nI get that you want a specific thing, but think about what you're asking. You would be taking your other siblings, one parent, and your grandparents on a hike for your birthday where your disabled sister and other parent will have to stay at home and not get to celebrate with you. And your reasoning for not going with your friends is that they might complain, but your family is literally complaining and you don't seem to care.\n\nI know living with someone who needs a lot of a care can be grueling, especially for a kid, but maybe you could ask to go on a hike at some other time when it's not your birthday, so that one of your parents and your sister don't have to be left out on your birthday. Your gift could be a hike on a different day with your other siblings.", "NTA, sounds like youre a glass child and you deserve to have your needs met also", "YTA - your dad is right, you can do that with your friends.

On the other hand your parents are not TA for saying 'Sorry buddy we can't give you the exact thing that you want because it's not really practical' just as they wouldn't be TA if they said 'Sorry buddy, we can't give you the exact thing you want because we can't afford it.' Maybe have a discussion with them about what the limits of this are- if you win an award presented in a location that's not accessible, will the whole family stay away? Will you be expected not to go? Are you not going to be allowed other siblings in your wedding party because she can't manage it? At what point will something be important enough to not take it from you because she can't participate? Just so you can manage your expectations and build a chosen family if this is going to be one of those 'You can't have anything she can't' scenarios.", "I don\u2019t think the issue here is your sister or wanting to go on a hike. It sounds like you are frustrated with your family that your wants/needs always have to come second place because your sister\u2019s needs are always prioritised. You even say you don\u2019t get to do nice things often so I can understand why you feel annoyed. Like I said I don\u2019t think your frustration is with your sister herself, but is about the way those close to you both respond to her needs at the cost of yours. Birthdays are meant to be about the person, not everyone else do I can see why you are upset that even on your special day you are expected to come second. It isn\u2019t your fault you are the healthy sibling any more than it is hers she is the one with mobility issues. For this reason I say NTA. \n\nWhat I would say is rather than planning your birthday around your family, let them plan around you. Do something with people who will put you first, maybe some of your friends will surprise you and agree to your hike because it\u2019s your birthday and they want to make it special.

If so, how does that work usually? \n\nI get that it's your birthday, and it is natural for the party to revolve around the birthday person. Therefore you should be able to pick your event etc\n\n However it is mean to do it if it excludes your sibling, yes. But... back to, it is supposed to be your day.  As you've said in comments, your friends aren't hikers so doing it with them isn't a real option. \n\nCould you and your mom or dad go do the hike, then have family dinner or cake at home later in the day? \n\nHow old are you turning? Happy birthday! \n\nUltimately N.T.A because it is your day, and you can't always plan something for everyone so you need to figure out how to best make it work.\n\nEdit.  YTA due to a comment that you want it to be your parents and all but this sibling.  That's too exclusionary.  It's different than if you just went with dad, for example.  Not okay", "I think you could compromise and just do the hike with both your parents without anyone else, from your comments I think that\u2019s what you want without realizing it, both your parents undivided time and attention. \nI hope you see this comment and have a think about it.", "Nta. I get your sister is disabled and I\u2019m sure your family already does tons of sacrifices to let her feel included. But your also a person and are allowed to do and ask for things that are just for you that make you happy.

This is a tough one.  It's your birthday and you should be allowed to plan something without taking sister's condition into consideration.  But if you do that, your family will probably all have a problem with it and you might be hurting your sister's feelings.\n\nI would say to sit down and talk with your parents and tell them that you need some times/activities that don't involve planning around your sister, and they need to understand that.  Even if you were to take your sister this time, you need time with them or other family members that is just for you sometimes.  You shouldn't be expected to not have family time unless sister is included every time.  And by the same token, sister should also get times that don't involve you.  Forcing you (and her) into the roles of sharing family attention all the time isn't fair.\n\nThat being said, I'd suggest the hike be something like only you and whatever family like hiking, or that the hiking outing be changed to one where there is a picnic spot everyone can reach easily, but with trails that can start off from there.  Then your sister can go to the picnic spot and you and others can hike the trails, and everyone has fun.", "My friends hate hiking, it wouldn\u2019t be a fun experience I know they would complain", "I can do fun things without my sister.

This is how resentments between siblings start when, when parents put one child above the other and make it so that that other children feel like the glass child is the only one that\u2019s loved and matters. And no life isn\u2019t fair her disabled sister won\u2019t always get to do everything op gets to do.

They have to get a caregiver or the grandparents have to bow out as well to take care of the sister She simply isn\u2019t being fair and I hope she realizes that.", "According to OP she doesn\u2019t want to bring her friends because they may complain about the hike..", "Maybe she just simply wants to do it with her family and not her friends? Why should she not get to do it just because her sister is disabled? She's probably had to cater for her sister her whole life, and just one time, she's asking to do something she wants", "I agree.. NAH. \n\nOP: I think a good compromise could be a hike that leads to a different destination for a picnic, one that is accessible by car. Perhaps you have grandparents who won\u2019t join the hike due to age, but can bring sis for the picnic? That way your sister still gets to be part of the day, and just misses out on the part she genuinely can\u2019t do, because she can picnic, just not in an inaccessible location.\n\nWhile your father\u2019s suggestion to do the hike with friends is a good one, hiking typically isn\u2019t what (I presume are) teenagers envision for a birthday party. Most teenagers are MADE to go on family hikes, rather than asking one for their birthday. And it\u2019s clear you just really want to do this with family and never could.\n\nI think you need to explain to your parents how it makes you feel that you can never just do things like this. If you would not have a disabled sister, but a 7 year old one instead and you wanted to do a challenging family hike, that would be too long for a 7yo I\u2019m sure they would be less resistant and just get a babysitter for during the hike and they would probably suggest you move the picnic location to somewhere your little sibling could join. They would probably be less inclined to push so hard for her to be part of every part of your birthday, even though a 7yo understands just as well as your sister when you\u2019re doing something without them. We find it perfectly reasonable to explain to young children that they can\u2019t do something because it\u2019s for grown ups/big kids, because they\u2019ll be able to do it in a few years, whereas your sister can never do certain things. However these small children will still have to accept they can\u2019t do these things, and your sister has probably long accepted that there are things she can never do. She already knows and I think people sometimes try too hard to protect disabled people from a truth they already know.\n\nI don\u2019t know if your sister is mentally disabled as well as physically, but if possible I think she should definitely be included in the conversation. She may not mind as much as your parents think. She ALSO understands what it\u2019s like not to be able to do certain things, and while it\u2019s unfair that she can never do them and you can, it\u2019s also not the solution to all cut off your own legs out of solidarity. She KNOWS she\u2019s disabled and while she will probably be sad to miss out on a part she can physically not do, she may actually understand better than you think why you want to do that. But DO move the picnic location to a place where she can attend. There\u2019s no reason to exclude her from the parts she can participate in as well as anyone else.\n\nDisability is a part of your sisters life and the fact she can\u2019t be part of everything is something she will have to (and probably already has) accept. You on the other hand also will have to accept that compromise is part of life, disabled sis or not. You should be able to have a family home on your birthday if it\u2019s important to you, but you do need to accept that you need to compromise on the part where your sister can participate, because that\u2019s where it becomes singling her out. I also think someone should be with your sister during the hike, because I\u2019m getting the impression you don\u2019t want that, and that seems weird and potentially dangerous. Perhaps grandparents if they will be there. Perhaps they can do something fun on their own. Yes you might sigh now that you have to make arrangements and changes to make your sister feel less left out, but that is YOUR reality you have to accept. You have a disabled sister, and unless you want to be an absolute asshole, you make sure she will at the very least feel like you care about her and don\u2019t want her to feel bad.\n\nTL;DR Include sister in the conversation, suggest to move the picnic location so sister can participate, make sure sis has company during the hike and maybe something fun to do.\n\nIf your family likes hiking, you might want to look into hiking wheelchairs like GRIT Freedom Chair hiking wheelchair, it\u2019s very expensive but I think there are more affordable hiking wheelchairs too.", "Doesn\u2019t it go without saying that \u2018whatever you want\u2019 means within reason? If OP had said she wants to try herione or rob a bank, no therapist would say that the parents need to be happy with the choice the child makes. The reasonable provision here is that you can\u2019t harm your sister in the process", "Did you not see the comment where she states she wants everyone in her family on this hike except for her disabled sister? Other sibling(s?), grandparents, and parents \u2014 just not one. That\u2019s what makes her TA.", "This\u261d\ufe0f", "Yes, but you are an adult. Unfortunately OP and sister aren\u2019t.", "I'M SO MAD THIS ISN'T TOP COMMENT!! Like ok, maybe op is being a bit of a jackass, but how much is warranted? We can't possibly know more than what op tells us, and frankly they sound like a teenager (not an insult, just an observation). Teens are immature, they're selfish by nature, and they don't yet have the skills for real introspection. It seems to me they're lashing out by creating a scenario where they KNOW the sister won't be able to attend in a desperate bid to have one singular day where the attention is on them instead of her (this is shown how they want to do an activity that seems like neither their friends nor family want to do anyways - it's not that they really really want to go hiking, they just really really want one thing where they can do ONE thing that doesn't have to bend around their sisters needs). I don't think they actually want to exclude the sister intentionally, and I do think some amount of compromise is due, but making it to where their birthday has to include sister at every step of the way is asinine. Disabled people aren't stupid, they know they're disabled (speaking as one!), they know there are things they just can't do. That's why there are shortcuts, workarounds, ramps, etc. Like other people have said, maybe a hike with friends + the other siblings (if they want to go) and a picnic/family dinner after would be a better option. \n\nIt's basic reading comprehension + context clues, but I'm not surprised reddit wants to jump down the glass childs throat instead of the real assholes - the parents who are so wrapped up in their child's disability theyre making OP feel discarded and less-than.\n\nOp, sweetheart, if you feel like you can, have a conversation with your parents, possibly with your sister present. Make sure they know you've been made to feel like your needs always come after your sister's. Maybe some one-on-one time can be arranged. Best of luck, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!", "OP wants ro hike. That is allowed", "So you are saying that your family should never be able to do physical activities that you are unable to do, so they don\u2019t hurt your feelings?\n\nThat seems a bit of a harsh and unfair stance.

That makes it really hard for the parents. \nIf this was my kids, I\u2019d probably be saying the exact same thing as OP dad. If OP insists on this hike, one parent is probably going to have to stay home with the disabled sibling anyway rather than celebrating with their kid", "NTA by the way.\n\nIn Denmark we talk about siblings of children with disabilities as \u201cskyggeb\u00f8rn\u201d which translates to \u201cshadow children\u201d, because the siblings often stands in the \u201cshadow\u201d of the children with disabilities, for example when it comes to their parents attention, having to take care of their own needs from a young age, having to be more self-independent at a young age because the children with disabilities often comes first. (Hope my explanation makes sense, English is not my first language).\n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve had to always take your sisters disability into account when making plans, and maybe not asking for what you REALLY wanted a lot of times, because you wanted to of felt like you had to, include your sister in everything.", "There might be a hiking club or something in your area you can look into joining.

I get that finding accessible places can be hard.  It's annoying to have to check on places especially if websites don't disclose it easily.

Maybe make an open invite to a hike but don't require everyone else to go with you.  Or find a trail that would work.  Might be better on other family members too.  And make the picnic better. \n\nAll trails is an app that can be used to find easy hiking trails.

And I agree OP should get to do what she wants on her birthday. \n\nI just don\u2019t think she should exclude only 1 sibling. Either exclude all the siblings or include all the siblings.

Is there a big difference between this and your suggestion?", "Where does the family 'jump down her throat?'\n\nYes life isn't fair for the sister, I don't believe it's too much to ask that OP do something else with the family instead. The college equivalent is a bit far fetched and not comparable in my opinion, no one is asking her to change her goals in life to accommodate her sister.\n\nCurious if you have a disabled sibling? My little sister is in a wheelchair and personally I just don't like to make her feel bad lol life is hard enough for her. I do everything I want to do but I don't ask that we do something as a family and deliberately leave her out. I have no resentment towards her because it's not like it's 'my sister's keeper' or anything, it's just life and I love her.\n\nWe all have to make accommodations in life.

But I do this because I do activities with my disabled kid like play therapy that are also lots of fun.

It seems they forget that and even if op isn\u2019t disabled she shouldn\u2019t have to make her bday wish to spend time quality time with her parents. She should still be a priority to them even if she\u2019s not disabled. That\u2019s actually super sad. Op is going to grow up probably not having many good memories of her families or feeling loved and cared for. She will probably turn 18 end up moving away and cutting her family off and the only reason they will remember she exists is if they need someone to watch her sister because they can\u2019t do it anymore. Op will probably resent then so much she won\u2019t do it and I would not blame her. And if she does go down that route I hope she makes friends along the way that she considers and is able to call family and hopefully she will get some love and attention she seems to be lacking now.

That's perfectly valid and those are perfectly normal feelings for someone in OP's situation. Imposing the sister's needs onto OP's birthday is not cool and it's mean, especially because it's all too common in families like this one. OP is not a helper, a partner, or an aide. OP is the parents' child who deserves a freaking hike if they want one. \n\nThe sister's needs and wants should not, in any way, impact the relationship OP has with their own parents and siblings. It's the parents' fault if it does. They chose to have so many kids, they need to be parents to all of them. A hike is not going to kill anyone", "No one is attacking you though...", "Hey I agree with you. My sister is in a wheelchair and I feel like OP is just being mean, I'm shocked she doesn't have empathy for her sister. \n\nPeople act like every child must have an absolutely perfect upbringing and it's just not the case. Everyone has burdens in life, my sister's burden is being in a wheelchair and mine is that my life and upbringing has been different due to this. It's just life. Yes it was hard for me at times but life is hard sometimes. Honestly the hardest thing is seeing my sister have to live this way and not be able to do more about it, not having to accommodate her. It's just what you do.\n\n I wouldn't dream of doing anything to make my sister's life harder or make her feel even worse and more left out than she does. She has to watch everyone else around her do things she can't do on a daily basis, the last thing she needs is for her sister to rub it in.\n\nHonestly makes me feel like this post is fake or OP is younger than say 16. I'm not gonna read OPs comments because from the sounds of it they will make me angry and sad.\n\nLol at the downvotes how dare I share my relevant personal experience \ud83d\ude02", "These things happen, but there are literally millions of women who hike alone at all ages without incident, often for multiday hikes.

It doesn\u2019t matter the reason. Singling out and excluding 1 sibling isn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s not OP wanting 1 on 1 with her parents and without her sister. \n\nIt\u2019s OP wanting her parents and her other siblings and everyone else EXCEPT 1 sibling.", "Yes but she wants the whole family there.

We say it's your day, make it what you want, and if you can accommodate do so. \n\nThe sister is going to experience plenty of times in life when her disability makes something difficult or just not possible. We all do, disabled or not. It doesn't mean the rest of our family should set their limitations to be the same as ours. Expecting that, to me, would be cruel and selfish. The sister is going to have to learn that life doesn't always cater to your limitations. One day her parents aren't going to be around anymore to be fixers.", "OP sounds like a relatively young teen.

The disabled sister will probably feel horrible she\u2019s the only one that wasn\u2019t there. But how often does op and her sibling not get their needs met or have their parents pay attention to them because they are tending to the sister? if her sister that\u2019s disabled is there. Do you really think op or her siblings will be getting any attention from their parents? Even if it wasn\u2019t hiking.with sister there I don\u2019t think she would be able to get any time with her parents or her siblings.

I've seen it in real life, too, working with the disabled... but tiktok shows it up close and personal. I had a sibling absolutely ***explode*** on her mother while they were dropping the disabled brother at the group home, how the mother let her down and their other siblings down and all for this golden cold her favorite her 'boy' but couldn't even teach him to use the toilet in 23 years because she spoiled him rotten and stunted him forever, and that she resents his presence and she would never be back to visit him.

I hope you\u2019re able to feel better soon too. \n\nI just think excluding 1 sibling is wrong. Like go hiking with just your parents. Or pick something else to include all the siblings. But to me excluding 1 sibling is wrong. No matter the reason. I mean what is disabled kiddo is a make a wish kid. Should she decide OP is the sibling that gets excluded from Disney world just because? \n\nI won\u2019t lie. It sounds like the parents are definitely neglecting this girl. And that\u2019s awful. And I wish it was better for her. And I\u2019m taking this post and filing it away as reference for me because I do NOT want to do this shit with my own kids. \n\nBut I still think it\u2019s wrong to exclude just 1 sibling.

I see it as she's wanted to go on a hike for a while and they've said she can't because of her sister. It's like she's sick of being told no to doing things she wants to do because of her sister.

She may be fine with being excluded, if it were me I know this would kind of kill me.  I hope you think of something else you would like to do that wouldn't *intentionally* exclude one member of your family.", "Kinda YTA.

Why can\u2019t sis learn that she can\u2019t always be included or that she doesn\u2019t always get her way. It\u2019s not her birthday.", "The thing is, by making it a family, not friends, you are making a choice, you yourself are admitting that the family unit is specifically part of the celebration. So you are actually the one who made this about your sister.  \n\nYou are not being denied the option to gp hiking on your birthday - you say your friends wouldn't enjoy it - but it sounds like your family wouldn't either. What if the conflict was within your friend group? Or someone else that you really wanted to see there had a conflict? \n\nI'm saying that to honestly ask yourself if you would feel this way for someone you wanted around, someone through no fault if their own could not attend the party you wanted. Because this scenario will come up for the rest if your life, and sometimes you will absolutely be in the right, but this time really feels like you are digging in your heels and making it about your sister and parents, when it seems mainly like the party idea you want doesn't work for anyone. \n\nAs someone with a birthday in early February this is something I have had to understand as j got older, because asking people to go out in any capacity at that time is asking more of people, because there is the additional burden of the sharp cold weather after previous months of the same. Is it fair to me? Meh. It's life. Just like for your sister, this disability will control her life far more than it does yours, so I would recommend making certain this is the birthday hill you want to die on, because yes, it I your right to ask for the birthday you prefer, but it is nit up to everyone else to just give you what you want, the way you want it and when. \n\nThere will no doubt be, and have been times when you sacrificed unfairly for your sister, but families are never going to like the same things. This reminds me a lot of people who put really odd restrictions on their weddings and can't understand why people object. This situation is no where near that level, but unless you can be honest with yourself about why you are so committed to this idea that no one else seems to want to do, you may be heading in that direction. Could you see the difference if say your sister was in a wheelchair and the restaurant you chose is not wheelchair accessible but you truly would be happy with other restaurants that are? I am the kind of person who would want reasonable input into what I am involving others in, but not to the point of doing something I don't want to, but if I want the people I love and care about to actually enjoy the event, as long as what they hope for is not self centered, why would I not want to accommodate them. \n\nBasically, we all have internal biases, and you can't know if you are applying that here against your sister unless you are willing to admit that sometimes it is not on your sister's disability, but rather, the disability is being used as a catch all for you not getting what you want when there are likely a variety of reasons that you can't always get what you want. I would save it up for when it really matters. \n\nSo, I mean, yeah, it is an AH move to pick something to do that you know your friend group won't like, then blaming your family for the same reasons.

Mostly because I've had a parent hold stuff similar to this over my head for years after and it sucks.

If it's a family gathering, then the right thing to do is to make it an event that your whole family can attend; it's kinda cruel to functionally exclude your sister because she's disabled. Doing an accessible family party doesn't prevent you from also doing the hike with other people to celebrate your party.\n\nKeep in mind that as you get older, your birthdays are not really about you -- but you become increasingly the host. In fact, in a lot of East Asian cultures when people are adults getting together with friends, the birthday person actually pays for all their friends to go out to eat at a restaurant, because they are hosting and the friends are guests... Obviously you don't have to take it to an extreme, but keep in mind that as you mature, this isn't really just about making you happy like you're a 5 year old anymore.

To be honest, I don\u2019t actually think the issue here is your sister\u2019s disability, but it\u2019s just an issue of parents deciding how to host.\n\n As a parent, I do ask my kids for input on what they would like to do but it\u2019s really not a blank check to do whatever they want. This year, my seven year old son initially wanted to do a Chuck E. Cheese party, and I did hear his desire and idea and looked into it, but it was extremely expensive and, most problematically, the closest Chuck E. Cheese is 40 minutes away. So I ultimately deemed it too difficult for our potential guests to get there; (I\u2019ve taken my kid to a couple parties there and honestly it was a really big hassle for everybody; I did not complain but heard some of the other parents rolling their eyes a bit, and many of them were juggling what to do with younger toddlers who weren\u2019t included in the party but it was too far to take them back home during it.)\n\n So as a host myself organizing and paying for the thing, I just did not think it made sense to ask our guests to do something so difficult (and that was just a matter of commute and not even physical disability!) Instead, we had a really nice party at the bowling alley five minutes away that was a lot easier on the parents of all the first graders, \u2026. and my son had a blast!! It was totally great! I really think I made the right call, and I had to exercise the better judgment. It was a matter of balancing my son\u2019s desires (he didn\u2019t want to do a home party and wanted something cool \u2018out\u2019) with what we were asking in terms of our guests\u2019 effort and accessibility. The bowling party was a good compromise.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your desire to go on a hike is unreasonable in general. Just saying I can see your dad\u2019s rationale here, in wanting to host the kind of event that is feasible and kind to the relevant prospective guests. Birthday kids generally aren\u2019t the ones buying the food, driving the van, paying for gas, figuring out what to do with sibling care, etc. So kids don\u2019t get a unilateral right to decide what their birthday celebrations should entail \u2026 is OK for the kids to express opinions , but it is also OK for a parent to step in and intervene with the larger view of what it would mean for everybody involved.", "YATA, your sister struggles enough in life with her disability without you putting the mental pressure of you thinking she is not good enough to celebrate your birthday because that is practically what you are saying.

Or find a nice hike where you picnic first and some family stay behind to play games or something with your sister while you and the rest of your family do the hike.\n\nOr come up with a new plan altogether and pick something else to do.\n\nI get you want to do the hike for your birthday and want it to be a family thing, but your sister is family and you have to think about that. No matter how unfair that feels right now.\n\nOr adjust your plans and ask only one parent to come or something. \n\nI agree that for your birthday you should be able to do what you want, but at the same time, the best way to enjoy what you want to do is by also thinking about the guests and if there's restrictions that need to be in place. \n\nIn my mid 30s I had a girl friend who insisted for her birthday we do lunch, then bowling, then swimming. In that order. She wanted to go to a specific restaurant and a specific bowling alley and a specific swimming center and none of them were even close to one another. We would have had to do TONS of driving between each place and I questioned it. The amount of driving time would have been more than any of the activities, the lunch place and swimming place were closer together, but the bowling was on the complete other side of the city. I asked why it has to be that specific order, couldn't we do bowling then lunch then swimming. That way we could still hit up the specific places she wanted to go to but be overall less driving. According to her, I was the AH for even daring to ask for that change in plans. Gas isn't cheap, and I would have blown at least half a tank on her for that day and neither one of us was making the best money in the world. Our other friend originally sided with her until I was able to explain myself in person to our friend and then she was like okay no I see where you're coming from. Birthday girl made it sound like I was saying if she didn't change the plans I wouldn't be going. After being told off and being told I didn't have to go if I didn't want to, the birthday girl eventually realised it made more sense to change the order of the plans so the things closer together in the city were after one another instead of doing all that extra driving.\n\nAnyway - that was my friend not thinking about other people and if they could afford the gas or even all the activities she wanted to do that day. Ever since then, well even before then, if I wanted to do something special for my birthday, I considered who I wanted to do it with before even approaching the idea/plan to others. I usually would change my plan, either I wouldn't invite everyone I wanted to celebrate with because I knew not everyone would want to do the activity or couldn't afford it, or I changed my mind and chose a different party plan altogether if I really wanted to celebrate with everyone.\n\nYour sister, although she's special needs, will likely be upset if she's excluded from celebrating your birthday with you. You might even one day feel bad for trying to exclude her from this birthday. \n\nYour not the AH for wanting to go for a hike, but maybe adjust your plans so that you do a more accessible one that your sister can come enjoy as well even if someone has to push or pull her.

If you really want her there, then you will make plans that are inclusive. 2nd thought is talk to your sister tell her your plans if she isn't secure in her disabilities or comfortable knowing that now there are some things and places I can't go,then she will blame u for being insensitive. However, if she is secure and understanding, then she will be just that understanding. My husband of 20 years disabled (paraplegic) for 28 has to deal with the same thing, knowing and being understanding that there are places he can't go.

No one is saying OP can never go on a hike because her sister can't. Or even that she can't go on her birthday, just maybe don't take the whole family excluding one sibling? Go with a friend or group? \n\n I believe I'm a much better person for having to be selfless sometimes growing up because I love my sister. But whatever what would I know.", "Most people barely have a few friends nowadays", "Do you agree that not wanting to go and being alienated are 2 different things?", "I feel like if a friend asked me to do something like go for a nice walk for their birthday, even if I wasn't into going for nice walks I would just do it anyway because it's such a small ask. If this would \"alienate\" someone, that person sucks. They are free to politely decline, which is still being kind of a lazy friend but wtv, but actively alienating someone because they *invited* you to something you aren't interested in doing is toxic as fuck.", "Did you read the part where I said \"if they abandon her for asking to go hiking\"? This is hypothetical to the comment I was replying to", "But OP has had enough exposure to hiking to enjoy it and and know about this particular hike to want to plan it. So if OP is young, then there is at least one person in OP\u2019s life who is familiar with hiking in order for OP to have gotten to this point. Maybe whoever that person is could support her/chaperone etc while she finds a friend group.\n\nFriend groups from childhood rarely last if the people don\u2019t share common interests. I haven\u2019t seen any of my childhood friends in 20+ years, and I only see one of my teenage friends occasionally even though I only live about 15-20 minutes from where I grew up. It\u2019s ok to change your social group at any time.", "Wouldn't you rather spend time doing what *you* like (riding bikes) than hanging around with people who do things that don't allign with you or your values? I know that loneliness is horrible but it seems like you also don't have a deep connection with these people, yet they're holding spots that potentially better people could fill. If you're open to it, look up up the app \"Meetup\". And if that is not an option, heck even online friends seem better than hanging out with people you can't be yourself around.\n\nI don't want to underestimate the human urge for connection so I also understand that anyone is better than noone. And I'm just a stranger on the internet who knows nothing about your situation or what you have and haven't tried. But I really do hope you can find people to connect with. <3", "I'm sorry I didn't know this post was about you, let me totally change the angle of my comments", "It\u2019s huge in the community we\u2019re involved in too. Something no one considers until it\u2019s happening to them. Seeing my family leave my sisters out and treat me like a godsend was disgusting.", "Then the parents should say that to OP, that they can't afford a babysitter, not that OP should reconsider what they want to do because \"won't somebody think of the sister\""]}
