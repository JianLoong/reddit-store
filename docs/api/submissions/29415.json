I don't know how old you are, but are you able to do fun things you want to do that your sister might not physically be able to?", "Nta.  While it would be nice to include your sister it seems as though you live your life having to accommodate her.  There are times that you deserve to do what you want.  Most people don\u2019t see how hurtful it can be to always have to put what you want aside so that one person can feel included.  You\u2019re allowed to want to do things that others can\u2019t join in.  See if you can comprise.  Do a hike then do a dinner that includes the entire family.", "I am the parent of a disabled kid and a typical kid. \n\nYou\u2019re not being kind to your parents or your sister. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to want to do things just you and your parents. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your friends. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your grandparents. \n\nBut if you include all of your siblings and your parents and your grandparents, everyone EXCEPT your sister you\u2019re being really mean. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of your parents having to split up or plan around your sister. They will still have to split up or plan care for your sister to do what you want to do. \n\nI hear you that your friends don\u2019t like hiking and I\u2019m sorry to hear that because hiking is a joy. \n\nBut you should pick something you can do for your birthday that you\u2019ll love that everyone can do. For example, maybe google \u201caccessible hikes near me\u201d. There are often many wheelchair and stroller accessible beautiful hikes near you that your family including your sister could go on for your birthday. And bonus - if you choose an accessible hike you can take a wagon to carry your picnic stuff. That means you\u2019d have space to bring a cake on your birthday hike. Because otherwise someone would have to try and hike while carrying a cake which is a recipe for disaster. \n\nHappy birthday.", "Dear OP, to have a family party that excludes one member doesn't quite seem right. Why do you not want her there?", "YTA\n\nI get that you want a specific thing, but think about what you're asking. You would be taking your other siblings, one parent, and your grandparents on a hike for your birthday where your disabled sister and other parent will have to stay at home and not get to celebrate with you. And your reasoning for not going with your friends is that they might complain, but your family is literally complaining and you don't seem to care.\n\nI know living with someone who needs a lot of a care can be grueling, especially for a kid, but maybe you could ask to go on a hike at some other time when it's not your birthday, so that one of your parents and your sister don't have to be left out on your birthday. Your gift could be a hike on a different day with your other siblings.", "NTA, sounds like youre a glass child and you deserve to have your needs met also", "YTA - your dad is right, you can do that with your friends. Whining, \u201cit\u2019s my birthday and I should get what I want\u201d, is just immature. You\u2019re not stopped from doing what you want, you\u2019re just stopped from being an AH to your sister.", "I think that you should go on the hike with your friends and then have a family birthday party that is accessible for everyone", "NAH- I think people are being quite hard on you, you're not an AH for wanting to use the 'super power' of it being your birthday to get people to make the effort to do something no one will do with you any other day, and if you picked a date that, for example, meant  grandma couldn't attend it'd be 'Sorry honey, grandpa and I can't come, I have a root canal and he has to drive me' not 'You AH, pick something else'. On the other hand your parents are not TA for saying 'Sorry buddy we can't give you the exact thing that you want because it's not really practical' just as they wouldn't be TA if they said 'Sorry buddy, we can't give you the exact thing you want because we can't afford it.' Maybe have a discussion with them about what the limits of this are- if you win an award presented in a location that's not accessible, will the whole family stay away? Will you be expected not to go? Are you not going to be allowed other siblings in your wedding party because she can't manage it? At what point will something be important enough to not take it from you because she can't participate? Just so you can manage your expectations and build a chosen family if this is going to be one of those 'You can't have anything she can't' scenarios.", "I don\u2019t think the issue here is your sister or wanting to go on a hike. It sounds like you are frustrated with your family that your wants/needs always have to come second place because your sister\u2019s needs are always prioritised. You even say you don\u2019t get to do nice things often so I can understand why you feel annoyed. Like I said I don\u2019t think your frustration is with your sister herself, but is about the way those close to you both respond to her needs at the cost of yours. Birthdays are meant to be about the person, not everyone else do I can see why you are upset that even on your special day you are expected to come second. It isn\u2019t your fault you are the healthy sibling any more than it is hers she is the one with mobility issues. For this reason I say NTA. \n\nWhat I would say is rather than planning your birthday around your family, let them plan around you. Do something with people who will put you first, maybe some of your friends will surprise you and agree to your hike because it\u2019s your birthday and they want to make it special. If you wanted you could extend an open invitation to any family who do wish to join. Then have a family get together when you get back or later in the week when it suits you.

Here's the thing, you're allowed to have a 1:1 relationship with your parents and do things with them. \n\nYou want to go on a hike with your dad/parents for your birthday, that seems like a reasonable request to me. It sucks that your sister can't join you, but it  also would suck if you can't do your own activity for your own birthday.\n\nI wonder how often you've been forced to 'compromise' for your sister.", "YTA - go and do the hiking with your friends and a suitable family activity with all of your family. You\u2019re being both nasty to your sister and putting your parents in a shit situation which in all honesty would not make a very happy hike. \n\nSo go with your friends for a hike and have a dinner or inclusive activity with ALL  your FAMILY.", "YTA simply bc it excludes your sister.

You can choose to do a number of things that are ADA friendly but certainly NOT \u201cwhatever you want.\u201d At least not without consequences. And it seems the consequences in this case, are being made to feel like an AH for actually choosing what YOU want on YOUR birthday.\n\nAny good therapist will tell parents, that when they give children choices, they need to be happy with the choice the child makes.\nYour parents said \u201cwhatever YOU want\u201d and now are trying to make you feel like a bad person for failing to choose the unspoken \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.", "NTA - it\u2019s ok to want it to be just about you sometimes.

If you want to stay close with her, don't leave her out.  It may be your day, and what you want to do.  But from your sister's POV, that's exclusively shutting her out and hurtful.", "YTA.

If so, how does that work usually? \n\nI get that it's your birthday, and it is natural for the party to revolve around the birthday person. Therefore you should be able to pick your event etc\n\n However it is mean to do it if it excludes your sibling, yes. But... back to, it is supposed to be your day.  As you've said in comments, your friends aren't hikers so doing it with them isn't a real option. \n\nCould you and your mom or dad go do the hike, then have family dinner or cake at home later in the day? \n\nHow old are you turning? Happy birthday! \n\nUltimately N.T.A because it is your day, and you can't always plan something for everyone so you need to figure out how to best make it work.\n\nEdit.  YTA due to a comment that you want it to be your parents and all but this sibling.  That's too exclusionary.  It's different than if you just went with dad, for example.  Not okay", "I think you could compromise and just do the hike with both your parents without anyone else, from your comments I think that\u2019s what you want without realizing it, both your parents undivided time and attention. \nI hope you see this comment and have a think about it.", "Nta. I get your sister is disabled and I\u2019m sure your family already does tons of sacrifices to let her feel included. But your also a person and are allowed to do and ask for things that are just for you that make you happy. You got asked what you wanted for your bday and you were honest about you wanted you shouldn\u2019t be in trouble because what you want doesn\u2019t include your sister for once. Is it possible to say you want one on one time with just your mom or another sibling and go hiking with them and then meet up with the rest of the family and celebrate with them?", "NTA.  This is a tough one.  It's your birthday and you should be allowed to plan something without taking sister's condition into consideration.  But if you do that, your family will probably all have a problem with it and you might be hurting your sister's feelings.\n\nI would say to sit down and talk with your parents and tell them that you need some times/activities that don't involve planning around your sister, and they need to understand that.  Even if you were to take your sister this time, you need time with them or other family members that is just for you sometimes.  You shouldn't be expected to not have family time unless sister is included every time.  And by the same token, sister should also get times that don't involve you.  Forcing you (and her) into the roles of sharing family attention all the time isn't fair.\n\nThat being said, I'd suggest the hike be something like only you and whatever family like hiking, or that the hiking outing be changed to one where there is a picnic spot everyone can reach easily, but with trails that can start off from there.  Then your sister can go to the picnic spot and you and others can hike the trails, and everyone has fun.", "My friends hate hiking, it wouldn\u2019t be a fun experience I know they would complain", "I can do fun things without my sister.

This is how resentments between siblings start when, when parents put one child above the other and make it so that that other children feel like the glass child is the only one that\u2019s loved and matters. And no life isn\u2019t fair her disabled sister won\u2019t always get to do everything op gets to do.

Why should she not get to do it just because her sister is disabled? She's probably had to cater for her sister her whole life, and just one time, she's asking to do something she wants", "I agree.. NAH. \n\nOP: I think a good compromise could be a hike that leads to a different destination for a picnic, one that is accessible by car. Perhaps you have grandparents who won\u2019t join the hike due to age, but can bring sis for the picnic? That way your sister still gets to be part of the day, and just misses out on the part she genuinely can\u2019t do, because she can picnic, just not in an inaccessible location.\n\nWhile your father\u2019s suggestion to do the hike with friends is a good one, hiking typically isn\u2019t what (I presume are) teenagers envision for a birthday party. Most teenagers are MADE to go on family hikes, rather than asking one for their birthday. And it\u2019s clear you just really want to do this with family and never could.\n\nI think you need to explain to your parents how it makes you feel that you can never just do things like this. If you would not have a disabled sister, but a 7 year old one instead and you wanted to do a challenging family hike, that would be too long for a 7yo I\u2019m sure they would be less resistant and just get a babysitter for during the hike and they would probably suggest you move the picnic location to somewhere your little sibling could join. They would probably be less inclined to push so hard for her to be part of every part of your birthday, even though a 7yo understands just as well as your sister when you\u2019re doing something without them. We find it perfectly reasonable to explain to young children that they can\u2019t do something because it\u2019s for grown ups/big kids, because they\u2019ll be able to do it in a few years, whereas your sister can never do certain things. However these small children will still have to accept they can\u2019t do these things, and your sister has probably long accepted that there are things she can never do. She already knows and I think people sometimes try too hard to protect disabled people from a truth they already know.\n\nI don\u2019t know if your sister is mentally disabled as well as physically, but if possible I think she should definitely be included in the conversation. She may not mind as much as your parents think. She ALSO understands what it\u2019s like not to be able to do certain things, and while it\u2019s unfair that she can never do them and you can, it\u2019s also not the solution to all cut off your own legs out of solidarity. She KNOWS she\u2019s disabled and while she will probably be sad to miss out on a part she can physically not do, she may actually understand better than you think why you want to do that. But DO move the picnic location to a place where she can attend. There\u2019s no reason to exclude her from the parts she can participate in as well as anyone else.\n\nDisability is a part of your sisters life and the fact she can\u2019t be part of everything is something she will have to (and probably already has) accept. You on the other hand also will have to accept that compromise is part of life, disabled sis or not. You should be able to have a family home on your birthday if it\u2019s important to you, but you do need to accept that you need to compromise on the part where your sister can participate, because that\u2019s where it becomes singling her out. I also think someone should be with your sister during the hike, because I\u2019m getting the impression you don\u2019t want that, and that seems weird and potentially dangerous. Perhaps grandparents if they will be there. Perhaps they can do something fun on their own. Yes you might sigh now that you have to make arrangements and changes to make your sister feel less left out, but that is YOUR reality you have to accept. You have a disabled sister, and unless you want to be an absolute asshole, you make sure she will at the very least feel like you care about her and don\u2019t want her to feel bad.\n\nTL;DR Include sister in the conversation, suggest to move the picnic location so sister can participate, make sure sis has company during the hike and maybe something fun to do.\n\nIf your family likes hiking, you might want to look into hiking wheelchairs like GRIT Freedom Chair hiking wheelchair, it\u2019s very expensive but I think there are more affordable hiking wheelchairs too.", "Doesn\u2019t it go without saying that \u2018whatever you want\u2019 means within reason? If OP had said she wants to try herione or rob a bank, no therapist would say that the parents need to be happy with the choice the child makes. The reasonable provision here is that you can\u2019t harm your sister in the process", "Did you not see the comment where she states she wants everyone in her family on this hike except for her disabled sister? Other sibling(s?), grandparents, and parents \u2014 just not one. That\u2019s what makes her TA.", "This\u261d\ufe0f", "Yes, but you are an adult. Unfortunately OP and sister aren\u2019t.", "I'M SO MAD THIS ISN'T TOP COMMENT!! Like ok, maybe op is being a bit of a jackass, but how much is warranted? We can't possibly know more than what op tells us, and frankly they sound like a teenager (not an insult, just an observation). Teens are immature, they're selfish by nature, and they don't yet have the skills for real introspection. It seems to me they're lashing out by creating a scenario where they KNOW the sister won't be able to attend in a desperate bid to have one singular day where the attention is on them instead of her (this is shown how they want to do an activity that seems like neither their friends nor family want to do anyways - it's not that they really really want to go hiking, they just really really want one thing where they can do ONE thing that doesn't have to bend around their sisters needs). I don't think they actually want to exclude the sister intentionally, and I do think some amount of compromise is due, but making it to where their birthday has to include sister at every step of the way is asinine. Disabled people aren't stupid, they know they're disabled (speaking as one!), they know there are things they just can't do. That's why there are shortcuts, workarounds, ramps, etc. Like other people have said, maybe a hike with friends + the other siblings (if they want to go) and a picnic/family dinner after would be a better option. \n\nIt's basic reading comprehension + context clues, but I'm not surprised reddit wants to jump down the glass childs throat instead of the real assholes - the parents who are so wrapped up in their child's disability theyre making OP feel discarded and less-than.\n\nOp, sweetheart, if you feel like you can, have a conversation with your parents, possibly with your sister present. Make sure they know you've been made to feel like your needs always come after your sister's. Maybe some one-on-one time can be arranged. Best of luck, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!", "OP wants ro hike. That is allowed", "So you are saying that your family should never be able to do physical activities that you are unable to do, so they don\u2019t hurt your feelings?\n\nThat seems a bit of a harsh and unfair stance.

That makes it really hard for the parents. \nIf this was my kids, I\u2019d probably be saying the exact same thing as OP dad.

(Hope my explanation makes sense, English is not my first language).\n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve had to always take your sisters disability into account when making plans, and maybe not asking for what you REALLY wanted a lot of times, because you wanted to of felt like you had to, include your sister in everything.", "There might be a hiking club or something in your area you can look into joining.

You deserve to be the priority in your parents life too especially on special moments.

I get that finding accessible places can be hard.  It's annoying to have to check on places especially if websites don't disclose it easily.

Maybe make an open invite to a hike but don't require everyone else to go with you.  Or find a trail that would work.  Might be better on other family members too.  And make the picnic better. \n\nAll trails is an app that can be used to find easy hiking trails.

And I agree OP should get to do what she wants on her birthday. \n\nI just don\u2019t think she should exclude only 1 sibling. Either exclude all the siblings or include all the siblings.

Is there a big difference between this and your suggestion?", "Where does the family 'jump down her throat?'\n\nYes life isn't fair for the sister, I don't believe it's too much to ask that OP do something else with the family instead. The college equivalent is a bit far fetched and not comparable in my opinion, no one is asking her to change her goals in life to accommodate her sister.\n\nCurious if you have a disabled sibling? My little sister is in a wheelchair and personally I just don't like to make her feel bad lol life is hard enough for her. I do everything I want to do but I don't ask that we do something as a family and deliberately leave her out. I have no resentment towards her because it's not like it's 'my sister's keeper' or anything, it's just life and I love her.\n\nWe all have to make accommodations in life.

But I do this because I do activities with my disabled kid like play therapy that are also lots of fun.

It seems they forget that and even if op isn\u2019t disabled she shouldn\u2019t have to make her bday wish to spend time quality time with her parents. She should still be a priority to them even if she\u2019s not disabled. That\u2019s actually super sad. Op is going to grow up probably not having many good memories of her families or feeling loved and cared for. She will probably turn 18 end up moving away and cutting her family off and the only reason they will remember she exists is if they need someone to watch her sister because they can\u2019t do it anymore. Op will probably resent then so much she won\u2019t do it and I would not blame her. And if she does go down that route I hope she makes friends along the way that she considers and is able to call family and hopefully she will get some love and attention she seems to be lacking now.

That's perfectly valid and those are perfectly normal feelings for someone in OP's situation. Imposing the sister's needs onto OP's birthday is not cool and it's mean, especially because it's all too common in families like this one. OP is not a helper, a partner, or an aide. OP is the parents' child who deserves a freaking hike if they want one. \n\nThe sister's needs and wants should not, in any way, impact the relationship OP has with their own parents and siblings. It's the parents' fault if it does. They chose to have so many kids, they need to be parents to all of them. A hike is not going to kill anyone", "No one is attacking you though...", "Hey I agree with you. My sister is in a wheelchair and I feel like OP is just being mean, I'm shocked she doesn't have empathy for her sister. \n\nPeople act like every child must have an absolutely perfect upbringing and it's just not the case. Everyone has burdens in life, my sister's burden is being in a wheelchair and mine is that my life and upbringing has been different due to this. It's just life. Yes it was hard for me at times but life is hard sometimes. Honestly the hardest thing is seeing my sister have to live this way and not be able to do more about it, not having to accommodate her. It's just what you do.\n\n I wouldn't dream of doing anything to make my sister's life harder or make her feel even worse and more left out than she does. She has to watch everyone else around her do things she can't do on a daily basis, the last thing she needs is for her sister to rub it in.\n\nHonestly makes me feel like this post is fake or OP is younger than say 16. I'm not gonna read OPs comments because from the sounds of it they will make me angry and sad.", "These things happen, but there are literally millions of women who hike alone at all ages without incident, often for multiday hikes. I'm one of them, so's my aunt, and many friends. I would say don't hike alone if you are underage, or underprepared (I'd recommend an emergency overnight kit, first aid kit and a PLB) but otherwise it's a very rewarding activity.", "They weren't solo hiking. Hence the term \"girls\".", "In another comment, OP said they wanted grandparents to tag along too", "I agree with everything you\u2019ve said here. 100%. I\u2019m sorry for telling you to fuck off. Frankly I\u2019m exhausted. It\u2019s been a hell of a week for me. \n\nBut my issue IS NOT that she wants time with her parents she ABSOLUTELY deserves that and you\u2019re right that she shouldn\u2019t have to use a birthday wish to get that. \n\nMy issue is she has MULTIPLE siblings and ONLY wants to exclude 1 sibling. It doesn\u2019t matter the reason. Singling out and excluding 1 sibling isn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s not OP wanting 1 on 1 with her parents and without her sister. \n\nIt\u2019s OP wanting her parents and her other siblings and everyone else EXCEPT 1 sibling.", "Yes but she wants the whole family there.  Someone will have to stay back and babysit the sister.", "Life leaves us all behind sometimes. Some get into Yale, some don't. Some hit it big on a stock, some don't. Some people get cancer, some don't. If someone is planning their wedding and chooses a date when someone can't make it, we don't dog pile them to change the date or location. We say it's your day, make it what you want, and if you can accommodate do so. \n\nThe sister is going to experience plenty of times in life when her disability makes something difficult or just not possible. We all do, disabled or not. It doesn't mean the rest of our family should set their limitations to be the same as ours. Expecting that, to me, would be cruel and selfish. The sister is going to have to learn that life doesn't always cater to your limitations. One day her parents aren't going to be around anymore to be fixers.", "OP sounds like a relatively young teen. Which is why everyone is against the idea.", "yea isn\u2019t that worse? two young girls got killed together and they were in a group so ur proving my point \ud83d\ude2d", "Aaah, I stand corrected.", "She doesn't WANT to exclude that sibling.  She just wants to do something that this sibling cannot do.  There's a difference.", "It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m on my period and honestly it\u2019s kicking my ass. Yeah part of it is messed up. The disabled sister will probably feel horrible she\u2019s the only one that wasn\u2019t there. But how often does op and her sibling not get their needs met or have their parents pay attention to them because they are tending to the sister? if her sister that\u2019s disabled is there. Do you really think op or her siblings will be getting any attention from their parents? Even if it wasn\u2019t hiking.with sister there I don\u2019t think she would be able to get any time with her parents or her siblings. Knowing that why wouldn\u2019t op get to be selfish for just a few hours to get her needs met?. Anyways. I hope your able to take a bubble bath to wind down and your day is better tomorrow", "They can hire a babysitter if they need to, if its just immediate family (maybe even grandparents) then it shouldnt be hard. Its one day.", "That is not correct. She literally says in her comments \u201cIt\u2019s more I just want to do something I want to do on my birthday without having to plan around her.\u201d Her motivation is to NOT have to deal with her disabled sibling. \n\nShe ALSO says she wants her NOT DISABLED siblings to be there and to only exclude this ONE sibling.", "It reminds me of the tiktok families I see who make their whole life about their disabled child, to the detriment of the others. I've seen it in real life, too, working with the disabled... but tiktok shows it up close and personal. I had a sibling absolutely ***explode*** on her mother while they were dropping the disabled brother at the group home, how the mother let her down and their other siblings down and all for this golden cold her favorite her 'boy' but couldn't even teach him to use the toilet in 23 years because she spoiled him rotten and stunted him forever, and that she resents his presence and she would never be back to visit him. I imagine a lot of these siblings feel like this young woman did; she held it in for 23 years but couldn't anymore.", "Sounds like we\u2019re both having off days. I hope you\u2019re able to feel better soon too. \n\nI just think excluding 1 sibling is wrong. Like go hiking with just your parents. Or pick something else to include all the siblings. But to me excluding 1 sibling is wrong. No matter the reason. I mean what is disabled kiddo is a make a wish kid. Should she decide OP is the sibling that gets excluded from Disney world just because? \n\nI won\u2019t lie. It sounds like the parents are definitely neglecting this girl. And that\u2019s awful. And I wish it was better for her. And I\u2019m taking this post and filing it away as reference for me because I do NOT want to do this shit with my own kids. \n\nBut I still think it\u2019s wrong to exclude just 1 sibling. She has tons of options. If I were her I\u2019d do a hike with my parents and my friends and none of my siblings. But that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP wants her grandparents to go on the hike.  Sometime it is really really hard to find an affordable babysitter for a handicapped child.", "I don't think she meant it in the way you think she did. I see it as she's wanted to go on a hike for a while and they've said she can't because of her sister. It's like she's sick of being told no to doing things she wants to do because of her sister. She's probably been told no her whole life and had to cater to her sister needs when it should be her special day", "Saying you don't want to plan around someone doesn't mean you intentionally want to exclude them.  It just means that you don't want to make your plans conditional on them being able to come.  If another family.member suddenly said hey, I can carry her the whole way (i know they can't - this is a hypothetical), where is the post which said OP would object?", "She intentionally wants to exclude this sibling. \n\nI\u2019m saying, no matter the reason that isn\u2019t okay. Either exclude all her siblings and have one on one time with her parents OR find something accessible to include all her siblings."]}
