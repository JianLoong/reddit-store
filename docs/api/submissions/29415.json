I don't know how old you are, but are you able to do fun things you want to do that your sister might not physically be able to?", "Nta.  While it would be nice to include your sister it seems as though you live your life having to accommodate her.  There are times that you deserve to do what you want.  Most people don\u2019t see how hurtful it can be to always have to put what you want aside so that one person can feel included.  You\u2019re allowed to want to do things that others can\u2019t join in.  See if you can comprise.  Do a hike then do a dinner that includes the entire family.", "I am the parent of a disabled kid and a typical kid. \n\nYou\u2019re not being kind to your parents or your sister. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to want to do things just you and your parents. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your friends. It\u2019s okay to do things with just your grandparents. \n\nBut if you include all of your siblings and your parents and your grandparents, everyone EXCEPT your sister you\u2019re being really mean. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of your parents having to split up or plan around your sister. They will still have to split up or plan care for your sister to do what you want to do. \n\nI hear you that your friends don\u2019t like hiking and I\u2019m sorry to hear that because hiking is a joy. \n\nBut you should pick something you can do for your birthday that you\u2019ll love that everyone can do. For example, maybe google \u201caccessible hikes near me\u201d. There are often many wheelchair and stroller accessible beautiful hikes near you that your family including your sister could go on for your birthday. And bonus - if you choose an accessible hike you can take a wagon to carry your picnic stuff. That means you\u2019d have space to bring a cake on your birthday hike. Because otherwise someone would have to try and hike while carrying a cake which is a recipe for disaster. \n\nHappy birthday.", "Dear OP, to have a family party that excludes one member doesn't quite seem right. Why do you not want her there?", "YTA\n\nI get that you want a specific thing, but think about what you're asking. You would be taking your other siblings, one parent, and your grandparents on a hike for your birthday where your disabled sister and other parent will have to stay at home and not get to celebrate with you. And your reasoning for not going with your friends is that they might complain, but your family is literally complaining and you don't seem to care.\n\nI know living with someone who needs a lot of a care can be grueling, especially for a kid, but maybe you could ask to go on a hike at some other time when it's not your birthday, so that one of your parents and your sister don't have to be left out on your birthday. Your gift could be a hike on a different day with your other siblings.", "NTA, sounds like youre a glass child and you deserve to have your needs met also", "YTA - your dad is right, you can do that with your friends. Whining, \u201cit\u2019s my birthday and I should get what I want\u201d, is just immature. You\u2019re not stopped from doing what you want, you\u2019re just stopped from being an AH to your sister.", "I think that you should go on the hike with your friends and then have a family birthday party that is accessible for everyone", "NAH- I think people are being quite hard on you, you're not an AH for wanting to use the 'super power' of it being your birthday to get people to make the effort to do something no one will do with you any other day, and if you picked a date that, for example, meant  grandma couldn't attend it'd be 'Sorry honey, grandpa and I can't come, I have a root canal and he has to drive me' not 'You AH, pick something else'. On the other hand your parents are not TA for saying 'Sorry buddy we can't give you the exact thing that you want because it's not really practical' just as they wouldn't be TA if they said 'Sorry buddy, we can't give you the exact thing you want because we can't afford it.' Maybe have a discussion with them about what the limits of this are- if you win an award presented in a location that's not accessible, will the whole family stay away? Will you be expected not to go? Are you not going to be allowed other siblings in your wedding party because she can't manage it? At what point will something be important enough to not take it from you because she can't participate? Just so you can manage your expectations and build a chosen family if this is going to be one of those 'You can't have anything she can't' scenarios.", "I don\u2019t think the issue here is your sister or wanting to go on a hike. It sounds like you are frustrated with your family that your wants/needs always have to come second place because your sister\u2019s needs are always prioritised. You even say you don\u2019t get to do nice things often so I can understand why you feel annoyed. Like I said I don\u2019t think your frustration is with your sister herself, but is about the way those close to you both respond to her needs at the cost of yours. Birthdays are meant to be about the person, not everyone else do I can see why you are upset that even on your special day you are expected to come second. It isn\u2019t your fault you are the healthy sibling any more than it is hers she is the one with mobility issues. For this reason I say NTA. \n\nWhat I would say is rather than planning your birthday around your family, let them plan around you. Do something with people who will put you first, maybe some of your friends will surprise you and agree to your hike because it\u2019s your birthday and they want to make it special. If you wanted you could extend an open invitation to any family who do wish to join. Then have a family get together when you get back or later in the week when it suits you.

Here's the thing, you're allowed to have a 1:1 relationship with your parents and do things with them. \n\nYou want to go on a hike with your dad/parents for your birthday, that seems like a reasonable request to me. It sucks that your sister can't join you, but it  also would suck if you can't do your own activity for your own birthday.\n\nI wonder how often you've been forced to 'compromise' for your sister.", "YTA - go and do the hiking with your friends and a suitable family activity with all of your family. You\u2019re being both nasty to your sister and putting your parents in a shit situation which in all honesty would not make a very happy hike. \n\nSo go with your friends for a hike and have a dinner or inclusive activity with ALL  your FAMILY.", "YTA simply bc it excludes your sister.

You can choose to do a number of things that are ADA friendly but certainly NOT \u201cwhatever you want.\u201d At least not without consequences. And it seems the consequences in this case, are being made to feel like an AH for actually choosing what YOU want on YOUR birthday.\n\nAny good therapist will tell parents, that when they give children choices, they need to be happy with the choice the child makes.\nYour parents said \u201cwhatever YOU want\u201d and now are trying to make you feel like a bad person for failing to choose the unspoken \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.", "NTA - it\u2019s ok to want it to be just about you sometimes.

If you want to stay close with her, don't leave her out.  It may be your day, and what you want to do.  But from your sister's POV, that's exclusively shutting her out and hurtful.", "YTA.

If so, how does that work usually? \n\nI get that it's your birthday, and it is natural for the party to revolve around the birthday person. Therefore you should be able to pick your event etc\n\n However it is mean to do it if it excludes your sibling, yes. But... back to, it is supposed to be your day.  As you've said in comments, your friends aren't hikers so doing it with them isn't a real option. \n\nCould you and your mom or dad go do the hike, then have family dinner or cake at home later in the day? \n\nHow old are you turning? Happy birthday! \n\nUltimately N.T.A because it is your day, and you can't always plan something for everyone so you need to figure out how to best make it work.\n\nEdit.  YTA due to a comment that you want it to be your parents and all but this sibling.  That's too exclusionary.  It's different than if you just went with dad, for example.  Not okay", "I think you could compromise and just do the hike with both your parents without anyone else, from your comments I think that\u2019s what you want without realizing it, both your parents undivided time and attention. \nI hope you see this comment and have a think about it.", "Nta. I get your sister is disabled and I\u2019m sure your family already does tons of sacrifices to let her feel included. But your also a person and are allowed to do and ask for things that are just for you that make you happy. You got asked what you wanted for your bday and you were honest about you wanted you shouldn\u2019t be in trouble because what you want doesn\u2019t include your sister for once. Is it possible to say you want one on one time with just your mom or another sibling and go hiking with them and then meet up with the rest of the family and celebrate with them?", "NTA.  This is a tough one.  It's your birthday and you should be allowed to plan something without taking sister's condition into consideration.  But if you do that, your family will probably all have a problem with it and you might be hurting your sister's feelings.\n\nI would say to sit down and talk with your parents and tell them that you need some times/activities that don't involve planning around your sister, and they need to understand that.  Even if you were to take your sister this time, you need time with them or other family members that is just for you sometimes.  You shouldn't be expected to not have family time unless sister is included every time.  And by the same token, sister should also get times that don't involve you.  Forcing you (and her) into the roles of sharing family attention all the time isn't fair.\n\nThat being said, I'd suggest the hike be something like only you and whatever family like hiking, or that the hiking outing be changed to one where there is a picnic spot everyone can reach easily, but with trails that can start off from there.  Then your sister can go to the picnic spot and you and others can hike the trails, and everyone has fun.", "My friends hate hiking, it wouldn\u2019t be a fun experience I know they would complain", "I can do fun things without my sister.

This is how resentments between siblings start when, when parents put one child above the other and make it so that that other children feel like the glass child is the only one that\u2019s loved and matters. And no life isn\u2019t fair her disabled sister won\u2019t always get to do everything op gets to do.

Never go hiking alone", "5 people, 7 if you include grabdparents", "OP is requesting an event that is supposed to be for the *whole family* (not just the parents), yet actively discriminates against one specific member, and will undeniably negatively impact at least 2 family members as not only can the sister not go, a parent will also have to stay behind to look after her.\n\nThis is undeniably deliberately excluding the sister, and there is no way possible to twist things into being anything other than an asshole move by OP", "...Wow, now the asshole behavior is on you.", "Idk, reading the comments, it kinda sounds like OP wants to go on a hike because her sister can\u2019t. All the other siblings are \u201callowed\u201d to go.", "Guess we'll have to disagree then. \n\nFirstly, nothing about what he requested specified the whole family. Secondly, he is not actively discriminating. He is simply asking if they can do something on his birthday. No act has been committed yet. Thirdly, you don't need to be so flippant in your argument. The family can hire a babysitter for his sister, meaning both parents can go. Not every event has to involve every child in the family, *especially when it's the kid's birthday*. maybe he wants to chat with them about things he can't when his sister is around? \n\nAbsolutely nothing assholish about wanting to choose who you spend time with on your birthday, or what you want to spend time doing. Don't attribute malice where self-interest is the likely culprit.", "meh", "Could you quote the comments. I read all of them none of them give me that impression. \n\nAll of the other siblings can walk without problems and don't need to be planned around.

This is irrefutable.", "Well, I hope whatever OP wants to chat about is safe for kids because the other siblings are invited, just not the disabled sister. Also, it can be hard to find someone who can watch a child with extra needs. OP wants grandparents on the hike, so they\u2019re out. \n\nOP sounds like The Birthday Girl on Word Girl. IYKYK", "It\u2019s more of a feeling that I get, but there\u2019s [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/dvfw5WAizQ). OP is choosing something, knowing that it excludes their sister. If it\u2019s the *family* celebration of the birthday, shouldn\u2019t it include all of the *family*? (I\u2019m not arguing with you, I\u2019m just thinking this through.)", "He literally says that nowhere.\n\nIt is not asshole behaviour, and you clearly can't be reasoned with since I've been giving valid reasons to refute why he might be an asshole and you're just choosing to not see them.", "Am I missing something? Where are you getting that his grandparents are coming, or that he has more than just one sibling? None of his other comments assert any of that.", "I don't see anything wrong with that comment. Here's how I see it. OP wants to do something on their birthday, so what OP wants to do should have full priority since it's THEIR birthday. Why are people placing so much more importance on the sibling's wants rather than on OP?
