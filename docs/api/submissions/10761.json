{"id": 10761, "submission_id": "11ad4oq", "title": "AITA for crushing my mother-in-law's birthday cake?", "selftext": "Last week, my mother-in-law celebrated her 80th birthday.  She wanted it to be a large party, and she invited many of her old friends and family members.  My wife and I happily accepted the invitation, and we insisted on purchasing a chocolate fudge sheet cake for her birthday, since that's her favorite variety.  I suggested to my wife that we get cupcakes from our local grocery store to save some money, but my wife said that such a special occasion deserved a more expensive and higher quality cake, so she went downtown to a specialty bakery to purchase a cake.  I thought this was somewhat ridiculous, since most of the attendees are old and have diminished taste, but I let it go.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the day of the party, and I was running late from work because of an accident on the interstate.  The plan was for me to come home, change into a suit, and then head to the restaurant for the party.  Some other family members had rented out a room at a fancy restaurant on the other end of town.  In hindsight, I should have simply worn a suit to work that day, but I thought that I would have plenty of time to get home and change before the party.  I finally pulled into the driveway, quickly showered, and put on my suit.  \n\nThe only thing missing were my dress shoes, which I keep next to the door with all of my other shoes.  We have a chair next to the door to sit and put on our shoes.  The light was off in the foyer, and it was a bit hard to see, but I found my dress shoes and sat down on the chair to put them on.  Suddenly, I knew something was wrong.  I felt an odd squishy sensation after sitting down.  I frantically turned on the light, and I noticed that my wife had placed the cake on the chair while she got ready in the bathroom.  I had crushed it.  Frosting and chunks of cake were running out the sides of the box, and my best suit pants had a large chocolate stain on their seat.\n\nNeedless to say, we wife came into the foyer and was first aghast and then furious.  I tried explaining to her that we always use this seat to put our shoes on and that I was in a hurry, so I didn't put the light on.  I also reminded her that we wouldn't have wasted so much money if we had simply bought cupcakes, as I had suggested. She said that I ruined her mother's special day and then she accused me of sitting on the cake on purpose because I thought she had spent too much money.  I told her that she was completely wrong and that she should have simply put the cake on the counter to avoid this scenario.  My wife is still mad at me to this day, and my pants still have the stain.

Especially since you jumped on the chance to rub it in your wife's face? That was weird. Even if she set the cake in a strange spot I'm sure she assumed a grown man would look where he's sitting.  This whole story just feels bizarre somehow. Like,  why did being in a hurry stop you from turning on a light?

I\u2019ll phrase it like I do when I\u2019m working with very young children. Accidents happen, but when they do we apologize and try to make it better. Instead you chose that moment, when you just wrecked a big part of an important event (accidentally), to put her cake decision down. How would cupcakes have been better exactly? They still take up space, probably would\u2019ve been on the chair the same way, and would still have smooshed. That part makes you the AH.", "YTA to the point that I am not sure it actually was an accident.", "YTA, you both messed up here, but it was clearly an accident. She put it in a stupid place. You sat down without looking. Equal culpability. (tho sitting down without looking is extra stupid, and you could have injured yourself so, stop complaining about cake on your pants)\n\nIt's telling that wife leaped to the assumption you had done something so mean in retaliation for her buying the more expensive cake which suggests there are more problems going on here than just a cake accident. Just how much had you complained about the costs of that cake? Do you really think older people don't deserve nice food?\n\nThe classy thing would have been to pay the price to replace it no matter whose fault it is, and to do the running around/take the trouble to make things easier for your wife.  It's an 80 year old's birthday.\n\nYour attitude in this whole thing has been entitled and complainy. I'm not surprised your wife is mad at you.", "YTA for not immediately apologizing for your \u201caccident\u201d", "YTA for your whole attitude, plus you saw your shoes but didn\u2019t see a big cake box?

That was also unfair. \n\nBut mostly you suck for trying to blame her while you were the one in a panic and not paying attention.", "There is never, ever a way to make supermarket cupcakes look like anything but.

How are people this stupid?\n\nYour attitude towards older people and your general pettiness def make you an AH aswell.", "ESH.
