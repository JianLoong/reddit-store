Not at all.  An unattended cart is not a placeholder.", "NTA I will admit I have realized it forgot an item when the cashier has begun to check me out and apologized and asked if it was okay to grab something quicky and doing a mad dash to grab it.  I certainly wouldn't do if if people were waiting in line. However,  I have never abandoned my cart at a check out line to grab a few more items and expected the cashier to hold up the line.", "NTA. I hope Whole Foods bans this racist AH.", "Did you really need to ask if the enraged racist who ignores all etiquette and social conventions was the asshole in this story?", "NTA.\n\n1) That is not how lines work. It's one thing if you forget the butter and run to get it but you should have the rest of your stuff on the belt. How do I know this? It happened to me on Sunday and I ran like a madman to get it.\n\n2) There's no reason ever to resort to ethnic slurs. Ever ever. Lady needed to be kicked out and banned.", "NTA.   This is a common ploy by assholes - to use their cart or whatever to \"reserve\" their spot.  IMO if there's no actual body standing in line there's no one in line.    I would have done the same as you.  Good for the clerk for standing up for you.", "Yikes\n\nNTA\n\nAs an Asian person, I just wanna talk to this lady.

Miserable.) please believe me when I say A) NTA and B) the cashier was delighted to have the opportunity to tell the customer to pound sand. One of my managers said WFM was like a stage for some people- they got off on being awful to store employees who are very limited in what they can do or say in a given situation. There were awful customers who had been coming in for over a decade and being horrible once a week, or more. Public facing jobs are hell and should be better paid because the burnout is real.", "You all sound pretty unpleasant. Her anger was of course completely uncalled for. But I don't know why you wanted to goad the woman; when she asked if you moved the cart; all you had to do was say \"No.\" And the clerk was rude about it; could've just confirmed he moved the cart, due to store policy, and if she continued to rant just said \"Take it up with the manager\" (the best way to deal with this kind of situation). And the guy at the back of the line has a sexist foul mouth; I'd say he doesn't deserve to shop there either! The whole situation was handled poorly.", "I don\u2019t know . . .
