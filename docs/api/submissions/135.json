I met up with his parents, they loved me and I loved them, I gave them the biscuits and they loved the attention, but here's the thing : my boyfriend's parents have been separated for decades now, because of a very sad story that tore their family apart (my bf's bio mom cheated on his dad) and even though he denies it, and doesn't show it, he still resents her for it. Word travels lightning fast in our small town, and she found out that I met up with my bf's dad and stepmom, and she was apparently quite saddened by the news, but understands. I told my boyfriend that it was only fair that we'd meet up with her as well and he said okay. I told him I'd make biscuits for her too, and he already seemed not to like the idea...The day before meeting up, my boyfriend enters the kitchen and sees me baking the same biscuits I gave his dad and stepmom earlier, but for his mom, this time. He asks what I'm doing, I tell him, and he goes \"You're really doing that? Why are you going through that pain, it's not worth it\", I tell him he's being weird and there's no reason I wouldn't treat his mom the way I did his dad and stepmom and he just leaves the room. While we get ready to leave, he tells me to leave the biscuits at home, that she won't like them anyway, that there's no reason, so I confront him and ask him why a simple nice gesture for her is too much to him. He pretends not to understand, I cave, because I don't want it to become a full blown argument. We have a lovely time with his mom, then we go home...My bf's not a fan of sugar and I made a full batch, so about 30 biscuits...Yesterday, his mom passed by to say hi because she was running errands on our side of the town while he was at work. It was thirty seconds, I gave her the biscuits because I didn't want them to go to waste. My bf found out because she complimented them to him on the phone, and now he's mad. This is ridiculous to me, childish even, and it makes no sense. I think he still hasn't forgiven her for the trauma of his parents' divorce (it was very tough on him, the other he was telling me about how it \"ruined his life\" because the guy his mom left his dad for was a PoS and basically made his life a living hell for a decade and he still remembers the day his parents sat him down to tell him it was over), but he also talks with her on the phone at least once a week and is very sweet to her, never a bad word...He's cold with me now and refuses to admit there is something wrong...Am I the asshole for just wanting to treat his parents equally?", "created_utc": 1667250423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yioyqw/aita_for_making_my_22f_boyfriends_27m_mother/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He will see it as a huge betrayal (because it will be) and respond accordingly.", "YTA \n\nHe\u2019s allowed to manage his relationships differently than you would, he also doesn\u2019t have to want them to be treated equally.\n\nHe clearly has resentment and issues with his mother, which you\u2019re fully aware of and when he asked you not to give her the biscuits, you did anyway.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, this isn\u2019t about the biscuits, it\u2019s about you not listening to his feelings or understanding where he\u2019s coming from and deliberately doing the thing he asked you not to behind his back.", "YTA.  Yes, the biscuits are a bit of a silly stand to take, all things considered, but when what you\u2019re considering is **this**\u2026\n\n> the guy his mom left his dad for was a PoS and basically made his life a living hell for a decade\n\n*That\u2019s* why Birth Mom doesn\u2019t get equal treatment with Dad and Mom He Actually Trusts to Care About and Protect Him.  He does not *ever* have to fully forgive her for that.  The fact he\u2019s willing to maintain cordial relations should be more than enough.  She\u2019s not entitled to biscuits on top of that.  At the very least, if you don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s holding the line on a particular thing, talk it out until you do; don\u2019t just insist you don\u2019t see the problem, so you\u2019re going to go out of your way to make sure her feelings aren\u2019t hurt.  She *knows* why things are the way they are, and she\u2019s going to have to live with her role in making them that way.", "Those biscuits didn't go to waste, they are now feeding conflict between you and your partner.\n\nYTA. He gave you clear guidance about his own family and you disrespected his wishes. That is one area he gets to drive and you get to show him that you love and respect him by trusting him to do it right.", ">Am I the asshole for just wanting to treat his parents equally?\n\nYTA\n He only wanted you to meet his dad and (step) mom. You are the one who pushed for the contact with his mother. \nYour boyfriend established the amount of contact with her he is comfortable with, and you keep pushing him beyond that. \nYou've gotten the story behind why their relationship is strained, he says that he was put through hell for a decade and you're calling his reaction \"ridiculous to me, childish even, and it makes no sense.\"\n What is it about the situation that you don't understand? \nWhat's the end goal here? Are you going to put the \"apparent\" feelings of a woman you don't actually know over those of the man your supposed to care about?", "YTA they're his parents and it's his trauma. Defer to his judgement. Are you going to interfere and pressure him about all family stuff going forward? It's not your place.", "YTA. He was already uncomfortable with the idea. 30 extra biscuits didn't just acidentally pop into existence. I know you meant well, and you wanted equal treatment, but you already had his thoughts on the matter before the oven ever got turned on. And is it really about the biscuits, or are you trying to be the fixer of all of his relationships? Whatever his reasoning is, you've gotta respect that. You're dating him, not his parents. The one deserving the most respect isn't his mom or dad or stepmom, it's him.", "YTA. \nYes, this in essence was a kind gesture and you had good intentions but you lacked empathy in this entirely. \nYou do not know why it might be an issue for him- that information belongs to him only. You went against his wishes that he expressed to you multiple times. It was not your place.", "YTA\n\nYou are brand new and have been dating this guy a minute. Pretty sure he is the expert on his parents and you are not. He very clearly and multiple times told you not do do something. You decided that you knew best. I don\u2019t know what reaction you were expecting. It would be clear to anyone over 5 that pissed off was the reaction you were going to get.", "Yta. He made a very simple request and you chose not to honor it.", "YTA, this ain't your circus, and it ain't your monkeys. butt out or be TA.", "YTA for doing it behind his back and against his wishes. I hate saying it, because it is a sweet gesture, but he has his reasons. Would you want him to do something like that behind your back and against your wishes? \n\nWe\u2019ve read plenty of posts here of things going awry when someone wants to do something nice for their partner\u2019s family. These things rarely end well.", "YTA, it's a really early relationship and you have no right to say what's best for him here imo", "[deleted]", "YTA. You need to let bf take the lead on how you two interact with all of his family. It was obvious to you that it bothered him but because he could not articulate it in a way that you could understand/agree with you just decided he needed to get over it. Not cool. Try supporting him and listening and perhaps in time he will open up more about his complicated feelings here.", "NTA, you meant well.  However, in most cases, I treat other people\u2019s parents the way the person who is my friend wants me to treat them.  Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want you to be friends with his mother.  You should probably respect that.\n\nHis situation with his mom is for him to work out.  I\u2019d apologize for overstepping, explain your reasoning, and agree to follow his lead in dealing with his mom from now on.\n\nMy guess is he doesn\u2019t want her \u201cdropping in when she is in the area.\u201d  I feel for the woman, but you need to go by what your boyfriend wants.", "NAH - It was well meaning but your gesture should be within the scope of what kind of relationship bf wants with his mother.   \n\nIf you offered her some extra biscuits while she was visiting, you are fine.   If you told her that you made them for her the day before, then I think that would cross the fine line.  If you told her that her son refused to bring them then you would be well over the line.\n\nBF has a right to not forgive her for letting a man make his life a living hell, and you should not consider that childish.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs some serious therapy. Making biscuits for both was sweet. Unless he can give you an actual reason NTA.", "NTA. He needs to separate his trauma from how he treats you. He's pretending everything is okay with his mother, even. It is a civil gesture to bring a gift when meeting a relative for the first time. He can be quiet about it.", "YTA he didn't want you to give his mom biscuits and made that clear.", "YTA\n\nYou aren't taking your boyfriend's concerns seriously.", "YTA You don't seem to show any empathy for your BF feelings. He communicated his objection to your gift twice. WTF?", "ESH\n\nYou are getting a lot of Y T A comments because you are not respecting a boundary he has with his mother.  And that is fair and true. He has very valid reasons for being upset with his mother, and you should respect his feelings and support him.\n\nThat being said, you also mention that HE is nothing but nice to his bio mother.  Instead, it seems like he is using *you* to take a petty shot at her.  He knows that she knows you gave stepmom cookies, so he just wants to deliver that little burn of knowing that you did not make cookies for her.  But that is putting you in the middle, and taking this nice thing you did for his stepmom and making it this weird thing between you and his mom. I would not be pleased to be placed in the middle like that either.  Especially when *he* is making nice with his mom.  Keeping up his own relationship, but sabotaging your budding one, in order to score shots on her.", "YTA it is really hard to understand the entire family dynamic when you just see an outsider\u2019s prospective. She made 10 years of his life hell with her decisions, I\u2019m not surprised he hasn\u2019t forgiven her. I would guess there is more to it too. It\u2019s his family, respect his wishes and trust that he knows them better than you do.", "YTA.  I had an abusive mother.  Sorry but, you just don't get it.", "YTA. He has a complicated relationship with his mom. Don't try to make decisions for him.", "You've been dating this guy for a few months, do you already live with him? You need to step back and stay out of his family any more than he invites you into it. \n\nHe told you no several times about making something for his mom and you insisted that you knew better. You could have frozen the dough. You could have frozen the damn biscuits, but no. You insisted you were right. And you weren't. YTA", "NTA. You didn't gave them on the day. You only give them to her because he doesn't like sweet things, you didn't want to throw them away and she just happened to stop by. I think your bf need to express his true feelings to his mum so that the healing process can began. By pretending everything is fine when with her he is both lying to her (she seem unaware of the resentment), lying to himself and sending a lot of mix messages to you on how to behave with her in the future (aka Christmas presents, birthday presents...).", "He needs to forgive. He doesnt have to say it to her face, but he gotta forgive her in his mind. This resentment will only make him more bitter in the future. And he's 27 already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's real easy to say \"it's not fair\" \"I'm just trying to be nice\", but when your shouting it in order to drown out someone else's voice, it's really just about protecting you're own ego.", "Definitely seems like the real issue is the OP is trying to force serious emotional conversations out of her bf when he is clearly not ready", "Did you miss where her boyfriend repeatedly said that he doesn\u2019t like his mom? He probably didn\u2019t even want to meet up. OP is trying to force equal, when in fact, he sees his step mom as his mom, not the woman who screwed up his family.", "He doesn\u2019t even like his mom, clearly he doesn\u2019t want his gf hanging out with her or making nice. Mom obviously sees her as a weak link to get to her son", "He gave actual reasons\u2026", "This OP ^^^^\n\nYou need to respect boundaries that your significant other puts in place. \n\nIt's like saying \"hey do you want sugar in your tea\" and they say \"no I don't like sugar\" but you put sugar in the tea anyways, they end up not drinking the tea and get upset that you didn't listen. Then you turn around and say it's no big deal I don't want to waste the sugar and completely ignore what the other person is saying. \n\nYour boyfriend is also an arse though, as he is clearly trying to hurt his bio mom and is using you in the process to achieve his goal. If he wants to hurt her, maybe he should grow a back bone and just tell her the truth and go no contact. \n\nYa'll need to sit down and have a serious conversation about personal boundaries.", "But he didn\u2019t even want her to meet the mother so it wasn\u2019t some tactical approach by the BF. It\u2019s likely that OP has a decent relationship with her mom and can\u2019t stand/comprehend the distance that her BF has with his. He is able to be polite on the phone. That doesn\u2019t mean he wants a \u201cdrop by when I\u2019m in the area\u201d relationship with her and OP is sending a msg that bf doesn\u2019t agree with.", "He doesn\u2019t need to forgive shit. His mom ruined his family, he doesn\u2019t want a relationship, you can\u2019t force that", "That's a bit of a leap.  She said \"*I told my boyfriend that it was only fair that we'd meet up with her as well and he said okay.*\"  No indication that he had a problem with it.  I would not be surprised if this is similar to the conversation she had about meeting dad and stepmom, given that she said she \"got\" to meet them recently.  She asked, he said okay.\n\nHe talks to his mother every week and is nothing but nice to her.  A single lunch with a girlfriend of a few months - who did NOT bring cookies lol - is likely not what made her think she could drop by when she was in the area.  That is more likely an already established relationship between them.\n\nI absolutely agree that OP is being dismissive of his issues with his mother, and she needs to be more respectful of that.  But it also seems like his boundaries are more for HER and not for HIM. He wants to maintain a pleasant, nice relationship with his mother.  But he used his gf to burn her a little.  Again, I would not like to be put in that position either.", "Yet he talks to her nicely on the phone? His behavior isn't adding up.", "Who said something about forcing a relationship? He needs to get rid of the resentment for his own peace of mind.", "Your perspective is valid but if they were on a drop by whenever basis it\u2019s likely that she would\u2019ve met her already no? You don\u2019t think it odd that she just happened to drop by within days of meeting the gf? I also think she \u201cgot to\u201d meet the parents because they were finally at that stage not because she asked but we\u2019ll likely never know on that end. If he used her to burn his mom yes he\u2019s wrong and I agree I wouldn\u2019t want to be in that position. My take is that he doesn\u2019t want equal treatment between the parents because he doesn\u2019t view them equally and that is his decision and his alone.", ">but if they were on a drop by whenever basis it\u2019s likely that she would\u2019ve met her already no?\n\nI mean... no.  Mom lives across town.  OP has only been dating the boyfriend for a few months.  So not that long that she is a regular fixture at his home, and for those dates to coincide when mom happens to be nearby.  She says mom left within 30 seconds when son wasn't there, so it's not like she immediately clung to the girlfriend as a way in to his life.  She was genuinely dropping by to see her son.\n\nI agree, he doesn't want equal treatment between the parents.  The issue is that HE is giving them equal treatment - he took his girlfriend to meet his parents, then took her to meet his mom.  Both times, pleasant and friendly.  But it is HER he wants to dish out the unequal treatment."]}
