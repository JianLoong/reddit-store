I got home from a 24hr shift at 7am this morning. I walk through the garage door and sitting on our kitchen island is a present with 2 cards; 1 from my wife and 1 from my kids. I proceed to open the cards and the present. After, I went downstairs to play a video game for an hour because no one was up. After an hour I go up stairs to take a shower, because I have a tattoo appointment in another hour, and my wife, still in bed, wishes me a happy birthday. I finish getting ready, go downstairs, and my wife is up and tells me she's disappointed I opened my present and I should have waited for the family to be up and together. I was shocked, like the meme of the old lady \"WAT?\" shocked. We had a small argument, maybe not even that, over it. My position is that she shouldn't have put the present (which was only placed in a plain cardboard box which my kids colored on) with the cards out in the open. How was I supposed to know I shouldn't have opened it when it was placed with other items in which I should open? It was just left there, presumably for ME. It is in fact my birthday and no instructions about present opening procedures were displayed.\n\nI leave to go to my tattoo appointment and come back about 1:30pm; after dropping into my part-time job for 30 minutes to talk briefly with some students. My wife and kids are taking down the Christmas tree, I give my kids a hug, and go to my wife to hug her. I did so because I was trying to move on past the morning's mistake, if you could even call it that, and have a nice birthday. All I wanted is to have a good day with my family. \n\nThe second i give her a hug she huffs. I asked what that was about and she goes into her being disappointed again because I didn't wait for them to open my present. We had a huge blow up fight (I can't remember everything that was said) and I left and all I really wanted was an apology from her for the way she was treating me and according to her she had nothing to apologize for. I'm now sitting in my car outside a liquor store on my birthday. I both want to go home and dont want to. She should I have waited to open the present?

And then the birthday person opens the presents. With everyone who gave something there.", "NTA, just a moron.\n\nOf COURSE the wife and kids wanted to see you open the present. People put presents out on display as decorations all the time and don't expect them to be opened in private.", "I mean, you should have waited. If your kids get you a gift & decorate the box, they probably want to see Dad's happy face when he gets his gift, right?", "Info: had she ever just laid out gifts for you before, without the expectation of being there to see you open it?", "Neither of you are the asshole, imo. You said it yourself, as you are in counseling/almost got a divorce. It's clear you have marriage issues based outside of this one incident, and this is something I would just move past yourself.\n\nTell your wife everything you wrote here (specifically the 3rd paragraph). Go home, tell her how you feel, tell your counselor how you feel if need be, and spend time with your family.\n\nIf you want to fight for your marriage, as you said, try to be as empathetic as possible, and hope she can be as well (which you can do by communicating w her and sharing ur feelings). There's a likelihood you were both exhausted from work/the holidays/taking care of the kids, and are likely other reasons for upset feelings. So no assholes here, just tired parents/adults.", "NAH it was a miscommunication. However, I\u2019m not sure why you wouldn\u2019t think your family wouldn\u2019t want to be there to watch you open gifts and cards they got you. It seems an obvious", "This isn't the first birthday you've had with your family. What do you usually do? In most families, people open presents together. My eldest just had a birthday on a schoolday, and saved opening presents for the evening so that the whole family could be there.\n\n(The kids get up at different times. The first one out of the house is on a 6.30 bus. The others aren't up by then.)\n\nYTA", "Would you have been mad if you woke up on Christmas and your kids had opened up all their presents without you there to watch them? Disappointed at the very least probably. You just don\u2019t open gifts without them being given TO you. I can see why your wife is hurt, but then you make a mistake and double down and expect her to apologize when you\u2019re the one who messed up.", "ESH\n\nOpening the present appears to have been a simple, excusable mistake. Arguments exist for both sides of this situation, but really it doesn't matter.\n\nWhat does matter is the way both of you handled this situation. Instead of moving past this silliness, you have both entrenched yourselves into your relative positions and want apologies from each other, and you're both acting childish until you get them.  You're both damaging your relationship over a simple mistake.", "Either ESH or YTA. Y'all should get over yourselves. This is too small of a thing to be so upset over. How this should have played out:\n\nWife: Aw you opened your gifts without us? We wanted to be there to see it and sing you happy birthday!\n\nYou: Oh I didn't realize that, thank you for the gifts and for wanting to share in that moment. I'm sorry I didn't understand you wanted to witness it but I love the gifts you and the kids picked out!\n\nWife: Sigh, alright, you're welcome. In the future though, wait for us! We want to celebrate with you!\n\nYou: Of course, thank you again.\n\nShe doesn't really have much to apologize for as it seems kinda shitty to get mad at your wife and kids for wanting to celebrate with you. And she should move on from the fact that it was a misunderstanding that you opened the gifts without them. My guess is you didn't give her space or understanding for her feelings of disappointment over the mishap which is likely why she's held on to the situation.", "YTA.  Seriously, you have kids and think it is okay to open gifts from them when they are sleeping?   Unless your whole family does this for everyone\u2019 birthday and there is overwhelming precedent, YTA.  Then you blame HER for being upset.  Might need to look up gaslighting on line.  Clearly, you are a selfish man if opening your presents us more important than creating happy family time.", "YTA but I'm inclined to go for ESH. I mean, I kind of find it odd to open a present without the person/people giving the present being there. You always open presents with them there. It may be a thing that can differ between cultures, of course, but to me the only time the gifter/giftee aren't together when the present is opened is when you simply are unable to.\n\nBut the message was slightly unclear, I will admit (although I still wouldn't open it unless it had a 'open me' sticky note on it), and your wife holding this kind of a grudge when you've already spoken about it is not all that nice either, and you seem to have made an attempt to move past it in your way. But please remember that apologising costs nothing and isn't as weak or surrendering as people often think.\n\nI'm glad you are in conseling, not that I would imply that you definitely need it, but it tells me you are both willing to talk about what's bothering you both and to work on it. Hope it helps you guys, it's always such a waste to argue over relatively little things.", "NTA but isn't it like standard procedure to wait for loved ones to open their gifts? I thought that was like gift opening 101?", "Everyone is asshole.\n\nHappy birthday. I\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t getting to enjoy it.\n\nThe problem here isn\u2019t really if you opened the gift or not, it\u2019s how you both handle conflict.\n\nYour wife is upset. You didn\u2019t intend to upset her but you did! It doesn\u2019t seem you apologised (properly)! Your wife, because she is upset / didn\u2019t get an apology, is acting out. You are both unhappy and frustrated, neither of you are having the birthday you wanted for you.\n\nGo home. Explain it was unintentional, but that you understand. Apologise. \n\nIf you think you can, explain that you are upset at her. However do not do this if you think it will escalate matters, or it will seem you are apologising so you can extract an apology from her. It\u2019s not about winning an argument, it\u2019s about the people you love being happy!", "YTA My sister lives in another state and won\u2019t open her gifts until we can video chat together so I can watch her open them", "OP, Imma spell it out for you because I'm siding with the \"you're a moron\" faction.  \n\nThe act of giving and receiving the gift is as important as the gift itself.  Especially if kids are involved in the giving.  The giver(s) get joy from seeing the recipient see and react to the gift (hopefully happy reaction, with a thank you).  The gift giving is an act of love, and by opening the gift without them there, you took that away.  \n\nThat is why your wife is pissed off.  \n\nI'm going to say NAH because I honestly think you're oblivious, and your wife is rightfully angry at you.  Do better.", "Going out on a limb. It\u2019s not about the present.", "I mean of course the cards/gift were for you but why didn't you consider that your wife and kids wanted to watch you open them? You purposely did it when everyone was still asleep.

What a weird thing to do.", "YTA but mostly to yourself.\n\nWhy would you choose to celebrate your birthday alone while everyone slept?  That's what you did.  You stole from them the opportunity to actually give you a gift and from yourself the joy of sharing that moment with them.\n\nThe fact that it never occurred to you to wait just seems so sad and makes it seem like you are disconnected from them somehow.\n\nGo home. Rewrap the gift, apologize, and ask your family if you can try again.\n\nMaybe get some ice cream on the way.  Let them celebrate you.", "YTA. That\u2019s the kind of stupid thing you\u2019d expect a child to do. Not a middle aged man.", "NTA my husband did this once, he opened his bday gift (vintage portable typewriter, I was very proud of it) while I was still asleep. I cried. He felt really bad and apologized a lot and then I realized I was an AH because it was *his* fucking birthday. He wasn\u2019t trying to be mean, he wanted to open his present. \n\nIt\u2019s the inability to let it go and making OP feel terrible on his birthday that does in fact make the wife the AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get what your wife is saying and understand her feelings but it was just a misunderstanding, something that you will (I assume) do differently in the future.

If you put Christmas presents under the tree and your kids didn't wait for you to open them on Christmas morning, you'd be disappointed.

BTW HAPPY BIRTHDAY!", "NTA It sounds to me like she is already checked out of the marriage and looks for any little excuse to point out your faults or what you're doing wrong.

Gifts in our home are opened after dinner and cake, but there is more to it than that.  \nBirthday at our place starts the moment a person wakes up. They get a special breakfast. The birthday person doesn't get out of their pajamas. They have control of the TV. They are exempt from household chores. Honestly, this all started because we were so poor when the kids were little that we couldn't afford much in the way of gifts, so the day became a big deal. Today, the kids honestly look forward more to having a big deal made over them than the stuff they get.  \nY'all are in counseling; why not make this a family-building thing? Make up some traditions of your own and try them out  \n\n\nHappy birthday, btw. Hope it gets better", "NTA.

This is not worth fighting over.", "Honestly you\u2019re NTA, but it would be so much easier to just apologize for the mistake.  It really was just a misunderstanding and I think if you apologized (at least in my marriage) she would apologize too.  Don\u2019t let a minor misunderstanding mess up your whole birthday and more so your marriage.", "Happy Birthday, you are NTA. If I walked into that situation, I would have done exactly what you did. A gift sitting out with the envelopes would be, to me, an invitation to open them. If they weren't supposed to have been opened, they should have been put away. As you said that you are already attending marriage therapy, I feel like this is a VERY relevant thing to bring up and discuss.", "NTA. They had left the gift out while you were working, and your wife would've known that you would see it when you got home at a time when they would be asleep. So it was reasonable for you to think they wanted you to open it when you got home. If your wife had such a strong aversion to you opening it alone, she should've put a note saying to only open with them, or something of the sort.

And he did the same. Before living together, I'd have to leave for work at 6a versus his 12p, and he'd leave things for me to find when I got home from work. I'd go to bed at 9p and leave things out for him to find when he got home at 10p\n\n\n\nBut also idk, maybe it's just me but I don't give presents to be the center of attention while the person opens it?? I do it so the other person knows I'm thinking about them, that I see them, that I love them, *when I'm not with them.* That I saw something at the store and thought it would make them happy. That I know they had a rough day and even if I can't be there to make it better, I can at least leave this token to maybe help a lil instead, like having dinner or a snack set out for them, or even just their favorite game queued up\n\n\nAnd I'm sorry your birthday was so stressful. That's an awful feeling, regardless of anyone's intentions, and I hope you were at least able to find some joy with the kiddos", "See, my issue is that if OP's an idiot for just going ahead and opening it (and he probably is), why isn't mom for literally leaving his gift on the table? Both adults probably should have known better... communicated, even. But she's trying to passive-aggressively get him to feel bad for *opening a present wrong on his birthday*.

While I don\u2019t have kids (and that might be what makes it different here), I wouldn\u2019t think that I was supposed to wait if they were laid out there unless I was asked to do so. If my mom left out my gift, that meant that she wanted me to open them when I saw them and the same would go for her if I left gifts out for her. When I want to open them with her, I hold on to them and give them to her when we are together. \n\nI can understand your wife\u2019s disappointment at a missed opportunity but to keep bringing it up throughout your birthday seems unnecessary. \n\nHappy Birthday though and I hope that you\u2019ve gone home and worked it out and that counseling helps the family!", "Your very last paragraph had me in stitches.

To me, that\u2019s what it looked like she wanted you to do.  Otherwise, why even have it on display?\n\nI can relate to you sitting outside the liquor store. I once got in a fight with my wife on my 40th birthday. We are now exes. \n\nReason I added the \u201cESH,\u201c is that I\u2019m (mildly)leaning towards that for your part in the fight.\n\nNever, ever fight over something that already happened. Explain your side once and then walk away.\n\nAfter that, it\u2019s just you trying to defend yourself from an unreasonable person. They are never going to acknowledge their mistake, so it\u2019s useless to engage them.\n\nAll you could\u2019ve said was \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you wanted me to open the gift.\u201c After that, there\u2019s nothing to say. She\u2019s going to attack you and you would naturally feel inclined to defend yourself, but she will never acknowledge anything that could be in your favor.", "NTA", "NTA, it was left out for you! If she wanted to watch she could have actually handed it to you. She's absolutely an asshole for dragging this out into a fight!", "NTA.", "NTA the gift was left out in the open, so you assumed you were meant to open it. I get why she was disappointed but how were you to know. \n\nWhile hugging her after your tattoo to defuse the situation you should have told her that she and the kids were the best presents you could ask for \ud83d\ude09", "NTA. I would have done the same", "I\u2019m gonna go ESH (but only slightly)\n\nYou were definitely a bit dumb opening them without her because COMON you always wait \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut she held onto it too much so yeah ESH", "NTA it should have been stored away and brought out when everyone was present.", "NAH but don't do that again.  It's very hurtful, I had it happen myself, I worked hard to get the perfect gift then rather than wait till I was back in the room it was opened with everyone who hadn't done a thing to organise it wile i was organising dinner, I was gone for 5 mins.  If its possible to see it opened and see the reaction people want to see it especially when kids are involved", "I guess ESH because what a to-do over a minor glitch.", "NTA\n\nYou were in the wrong for not waiting.  It's kind of a social faux pas.  A mistake doesn't make you an asshole, though, and you just came home from a long shift.  Your wife was not an asshole for feeling a certain way about it.  Where she becomes the asshole is when she blows up the whole day over it.", "NTA, she should have hidden it and given it to you at the time she wanted you to open it. I would also assume that those gifts were left there as a surprise for me if I saw them left in the open, I\u2019d assume it was intentional.

She left it out for you", "Your wife left that present out in the open for you to find, expecting you not to open it. (AH)\n\nYou opened it with no one around to see you open it. (AH) \n\nThere are no heroes in this story. Nothing but AHs, as far as the eye can see. \n\nApologize for your part in it. It's the least you can do. \n\nBut, definitely don't divorce her.

Especially after a 24 hour shift? I would have easily thought she was going to bed but wanted him to be able to have a birthday when he got off work!!! Keep it in the garage, the closet, or anywhere that\u2019s not sitting out in the place where people often set things. Thinking like keys, purse, mail. It\u2019s so central to a kitchen.

So the gift wasn\u2019t actually for you, it\u2019s simply a prop so you can perform like a dancing circus animal while opening it up. \n\nI\u2019m petty af, I would have just put it back in the box and told her to tell me when I can open it and went on with my day. \n\nShe was just so content to let this stupid thing ruin the whole day when it\u2019s not even her day.

Did she really need to hide them from you just so you wouldn\u2019t open them?", "ESH Could/should you have waited for your family to watch you open your presents? Yes. Watching someone open the gift you got them is part of the enjoyment of giving a gift. Were you required to wait? No. Was this situation worth having a knock down drag out fight over? No. Is it worth getting drunk over? No. \nI\u2019m sorry your birthday has turned into a crappy day. But from someone who\u2019s birthday is routinely crappy, pull up your bootstraps and move on.

Not sure if she\u2019s like that or if it\u2019s a cultural difference but it seems super odd to not wait for them to be awake? \nYour wife for blowing it up on your birthday, if she was really that upset she should have waited until the next day to bring it up. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are huge AH\u2019s just a little inconsiderate of each others feelings.", "ESH, but you more. She told you she was disappointed that you opened the gifts. You chose to ignore her feelings and wanted her to pretend like everything was fine. You asked her why she was upset, she reiterated her disappointment and an argument ensued. You want her to apologize, which is reasonable. Are you leading by example? Did you apologize for your mistake? If you would apologize to a stranger or a coworker over a mistake, why not apologize to your own wife? Instead you\u2019re sulking at a liquor store parking lot. Go home and say you\u2019re sorry.", "She's upset because your actions showed a lack of desire to share the moment with your family. She wants you to *want* to involve them. That's why she said she's disappointed, not mad. She's sharing her feelings with you, not accusing you of doing wrong. So when you reacted by defending yourself of wrongdoing she didn't accuse you of, she didn't feel heard so the issue wasn't resolved. She was excited to give you the gifts and wanted to see how you would react to the kid's decorations and she wanted them to see that dad loved their gift too. She thought you wanted that too and you didn't and that's disappointing. Please just listen to her feelings and talk to her and she needs to listen to your feelings too. Has your counselor shared the Fair Fighting Rules with you yet? NAH yet, just a breakdown of communication that can be resolved.", "AH is a strong word. More like inconsiderate and lacking of any sort of common sense.\n\nI also noted that you opened the gift and then saw your wife, but didn't thank her for said gift. So, unappreciative is a potential addition to the above list.", "I honestly can't say there's a specific way we've done it, especially over the last 5 years with my schedule. I can say that my wife is, at best, an inconsistent gift giver. Plus, to me, if I wanted to be present for a gift opening, then I would personally give it to you.", "I disagree!  If I got off a long shift, and saw a present strategically placed where I come in from the garage, I would assume they had left it there to be opened when I arrived.

God forbid he opens presents that were left out for him on his birthday.", "I disagree with you calling the wife an asshole by saying NTA. She had every right to feel hurt.", "Exactly. You don\u2019t immediately open Christmas presents that are under the tree just because you name is on them, either.", "Thinking back, I honestly can't say one way or another.", "She got him one present.  Proceeded to ruin the rest of his day.  So yes, she's the ahole here.", "I always leave presents on the table the night before. We do a whole thing with decorations and the presents appear with the decorations. But it is also an established pattern.", "Right, but surely the kind of thing you can just move on from pretty quickly? \n\nNgl, I\u2019d be a little pissed if my SO threw a fit over something this small. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t try to make it up either, he was ready to move on and give a hug but I suppose that was too much for his poor wife to bare. \n\nPeople do stupid shit sometimes.

Everybody wins!", "I'm a firefighter for my city", "How does this logic work? If you see a gift with your name on it under the tree do you just grab it and open it with no one around?

It's his birthday", "Then she tells him she\u2019s disappointed and moves on and doesn\u2019t keep acting like a middle schooler and ruin his birthday.\n\nShe was mad and had ample time to get over the hurt and move on. When he returned she chose to continue acting out over something that was already done and could not be reversed. Her drama and inability to deal with something that was now several hours in the past ruined the day.\n\nYou re NTA, but agree, should have waited and will in the future hopefully. \nShe is the AH a for her immature response and prolonging the rubbing your nose in the mistake.\n\nPeople need to realize we all make mistakes.

At least, in a tiny inconsequential way like this. Really not a big deal.", "Interesting. I wouldn't open a birthday gift left out for me if I knew I'd be spending time with the gift-giver later on.

Thank your wife.", "That's not how logic works. I made a binary decision: Is OP an asshole? Yes/No. I voted no. I then insulted OP, who seems to have taken in the light-hearted spirit it was intended. I think it's a huge stretch to say that my vote calls the wife and kids assholes.\n\nI could have considered a vote of NAH, but I didn't. Instead, I explained why I understood the wife's feelings.

It just happens a lot on this sub. Like people are totally willing to point out what OP did wrong in a situation but hesitate at calling them the asshole. It's baffling IMO.", "Literally that\u2019s the purpose of this sub and the votes. Votes are tallied, verdict awarded and post flaired as such for all of eternity for all future redditors to know if OP is an asshole or not!", "And I appreciate you trying to maintain some quality control for the sub!", "Yeah I get that it's tallying whether OP is TA.

My 6 year old knows to wait until the family is together before opening the presents with her name on them.

In our house any presents and cards strategically placed in sight on the table/island in the morning are meant to be opened as soon as the recipient wakes up/sees them. Usually they're an extra surprise like for Valentines Day or small birthday treats to start off the day. If I wanted you to *wait* to open them, I'd not dish them up for you. Sorry your birthday went that way.", "YTA or just dumb. Either way, yeah, don\u2019t open gifts from people not in front of them, it\u2019s very rude. Additionally you went in your room, where your wife was, and didn\u2019t even thank her? Like? When somebody buys you a gift you\u2026 thank them.", "Have they never given you presents before? This seems like something you should have encountered by now if you already have kids together.\n\nNow you know to wait next time. I think most people like to watch the recipient open the present they got for them, but clearly you didn\u2019t know it mattered to her. You weren\u2019t deliberately pissing her off - but I do think it sounds exhausting that this small error spiraled into a huge fight.  I\u2019m gonna go with NTA because this shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal once you realized and apologized.

The gift was left there.\nYou would assume you could open it\nOtherwise they should have put it away n given it to you later in person\nWife is TAH.", "NTA but you were a bit of a dill to open the presents without your family. They wanted to see your reaction. Your wife chose you though, surely she can see it was an innocent mistake and cut you some slack on your birthday.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to make a mistake, but you needed to apologize for your mistake, not double down and argue. \u201cno instructions about present opening procedures were displayed\u201d \u2014 ugh. You care more about \u201cwinning\u201d than about your family\u2019s feelings.", "NTA. They shouldn't have left it out for you if they didn't want it opened, but more to the point it's YOUR birthday. Those gifts were for YOU. Not for OTHER PEOPLE TO WATCH. Sure they might have wanted to see you open it, but they're not entitled to it. It's not the price of accepting gifts. I know a lot of people who dislike opening presents in front of others and would rather wait til later because they hate having everyone staring at them and waiting on their reaction. Not that that's the case here, but I want to emphasize that the point of giving gifts is to make the receiver feel good, not the giver.\n\nBesides which, if they were upset about it, it's okay to tell you they were disappointed, but not get in an all out fight about it and ruin your birthday. It's like how when you're given a gift you don't like you accept it graciously and can maybe tell them later that you were a little disappointed but you don't *start a fight with them there and then and ruin the day over it*.\n\nSeriously I do not understand all the YTAs here. Yes it might have been nicer to wait, but nobody told you to and it was an honest mistake, and nobody is entitled to your reactions, and she RUINED YOUR FUCKING BIRTHDAY OVER IT. Like holy hell is she very much the asshole here.", "YTA. Because that\u2019s my options. In reality you just didn\u2019t think it through.

Leaving them laid out like knowing he\u2019s coming home at 7am while they\u2019ll likely be asleep with no instructions would lead anyone to believe it\u2019s meant to be opened.
