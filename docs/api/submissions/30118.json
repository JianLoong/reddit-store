It's a small-ish place, with a counter where you can order sandwiches, smoothies, Acai bowls and salads to takeaway or eat it. There are 5 tables and a counter with 3 stools in the front section, and another counter and 2 tables in the back. When I got there everything up front was occupied, so I order and went and sat at the counter in the back. Other than me, there were two women at one of the tables.  \nThey brought my food over a few minutes later. Not long after that, a woman who'd been at a table up front came to the back carrying a big cloth bag and a baby. She put the bag on the counter right next to me, then spread out some kind of mat. It hit me what she was planning to do, so I said-very politely-'if you need to change the baby, there's a restroom right behind you'. She said 'Yes, I know, but there's no changing table and I don't want to put the mat on the floor. It'll get dirty'. My response was 'Please do not change your baby's diaper on the counter where I am eating my lunch.' Again, still being polite.  \nShe launched into a 'It's a baby. Do you expect her to stay in a wet diaper because you don't like where I change her?' etc, etc. And I said 'I don't want to look at or smell this while I am eating, You have a table in the front-change her there if you don't want to use the restroom to do it'. She got really worked up then, saying anyone could see inside the front of the restaurant from the street, and how could I do that to a baby and so on.  \nI finally went to the front counter, asked the staff to deal with her and waited while they did. She ended up storming out, threatening to 'write it all up on Nextdoor' (which is an absolute cesspit of fingerpointing and gossip if you aren't aware of it) and never go to that restaurant again. And I went back and finished my lunch.  \nSo. AITA for not letting someone change a dirty diaper on the surface where I was eating my lunch-in a restaurant? I mean, I'm absolutely mortified if my dog decides to poo near a picnic (we have a leashfree dogpark and it is amazing how many people like to picnic there.
