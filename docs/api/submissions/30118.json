{"id": 30118, "submission_id": "17lib42", "title": "AITA For Not Letting a Woman Change Her Baby's Diaper on the Counter Where I was Eating Lunch?", "selftext": "Decided to stop in at a casual neighbourhood restaurant on my way home from the gym around 2 pm. It's a small-ish place, with a counter where you can order sandwiches, smoothies, Acai bowls and salads to takeaway or eat it. There are 5 tables and a counter with 3 stools in the front section, and another counter and 2 tables in the back. When I got there everything up front was occupied, so I order and went and sat at the counter in the back. Other than me, there were two women at one of the tables.  \nThey brought my food over a few minutes later. Not long after that, a woman who'd been at a table up front came to the back carrying a big cloth bag and a baby. She put the bag on the counter right next to me, then spread out some kind of mat. It hit me what she was planning to do, so I said-very politely-'if you need to change the baby, there's a restroom right behind you'. She said 'Yes, I know, but there's no changing table and I don't want to put the mat on the floor. It'll get dirty'. My response was 'Please do not change your baby's diaper on the counter where I am eating my lunch.' Again, still being polite.  \nShe launched into a 'It's a baby. Do you expect her to stay in a wet diaper because you don't like where I change her?' etc, etc. And I said 'I don't want to look at or smell this while I am eating, You have a table in the front-change her there if you don't want to use the restroom to do it'. She got really worked up then, saying anyone could see inside the front of the restaurant from the street, and how could I do that to a baby and so on.  \nI finally went to the front counter, asked the staff to deal with her and waited while they did. She ended up storming out, threatening to 'write it all up on Nextdoor' (which is an absolute cesspit of fingerpointing and gossip if you aren't aware of it) and never go to that restaurant again. And I went back and finished my lunch.  \nSo. AITA for not letting someone change a dirty diaper on the surface where I was eating my lunch-in a restaurant? I mean, I'm absolutely mortified if my dog decides to poo near a picnic (we have a leashfree dogpark and it is amazing how many people like to picnic there. Like, it's the dog's toilet!!), so I don't think I am, but want to check!", "created_utc": 1698862108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lib42/aita_for_not_letting_a_woman_change_her_babys/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope her Nextdoor diatribe focuses on this rather than the rule against tabletop changing as she's more likely to effectuate change this way.", "NTA. You and the restaurant staff stopped her from creating a severe health code violation. I cannot begin to imagine the level of entitlement to think you can **CHANGE A BABY ON A RESTAURANT COUNTER.** \n\nI would love to know what she'd think if someone were **CHANGING A BABY** on her own kitchen counter. I bet she'd sing a different tune, even though it's even worse in a restaurant since it's a public space. NTA, not even close.", "NTA. The level of entitlement from her is off the charts. Her wet baby is your and the restaurant's problem because she didn't want to lay the mat on the floor? That's insane. The mat is made to keep the baby from touching a surface. That's exactly what it would do, then you wash the mat. \n\nAnd she didn't do it at the table not because everyone could see into the restaurant but because it's where she was eating. If she wanted privacy she would have gone to the bathroom.\n\nNgl that I'd love to see the Nextdoor post and how she tried to spin it though. Hopefully she got a reality check.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where you call the waiter, and tell them if they don't stop this you will report them.Mixing food and faeces on the same tables will get them closed down pretty fast.", "NTA! Holy crap!", "NTA, she had a table and could have used that", "If she was ok changing her kid next to someone's food, she should have done it next to her OWN food.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nPlease, pleaaase post an excerpt of her NextDoor post.", "NTA", "This is why some people with kids should be banned from all public and private entities.   \nFor kittens and puppys sake, this IS not the way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Jesus, hygiene violation at 2 o'clock! Nta and she had an option to change the baby in the restroom, her argument about the mat needing to stay clean is redundant as hell when there's an diaper full baby waste product about to touch it and a squirming dirt magnet on top. \n\nNta, she was arrogant and the worst kind of parent out there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ew", "NTA, you should have shit your pants to establish dominance", "No absolutely not.  The table and counter are for eating.  Not for changing a dirty baby diaper.  \n\n> I don't want to put the mat on the floor. It'll get dirty\n\nWTF is the point of a protective mat then?

She should take it up with the restaurant for not having a changing table in the bathroom, not your problem.", "NTA. She could have went to the car or bathroom. I have kids. Never felt the need to change my kids on a table in front of everyone. Especially strangers", "NTA. She could change her baby on the floor. Regardless if it\u2019s a baby it\u2019s still human waste. I bet she doesn\u2019t wash her hands after changing the baby", "NTA\n\nChanging a diaper next to your food is completely unhygienic.\n\nMaybe you should have asked her if it would be Ok if you came over to her house at dinnertime to make a poo on her dining room table.", "NTA.  That is a definite health code violation that the restaurant could be shut down for. Not to mention the stomach churning of watching dirty diapers being changed while you try to eat.", "NTA people just do not think about anyone else but themselves. Yes it\u2019s a baby and should be accommodated if possible but it doesn\u2019t zero out all other concerns (food safety in this case and just general politeness not to do it right next to you).", "NTA.

I know someone who did this with her child while we were out and I was too floored to say something so I'm impressed you did. I'm pretty sure that would be a health code violation anyway.

Wet) to smell like?", "NTA\n\nThat's disgusting.", "NTA\n\nHer having a baby doesn't mean she can change it anywhere she likes, especially where food is involved. Just because she's desensitized to it doesn't mean she's right. \n\nShe's using her baby as an excuse - after all, she didn't want to change the baby on her own table. So she knows, she just doesn't really care about her impact on others", "The Nextdoor post got a mix of 'OMG you entitled idiot' and 'OMG what an awful woman to give you a hard time'. \n\nI still can't get my head around thinking it's ok to do that on a table in a restaurant.

Urine is not something I want to smell, let alone have right next to the food I\u2019m consuming.", "I have no idea what a wet diaper would or should smell like and more to the point, I didn't want one close enough to my food in a restaurant to find out.", "I mean that sounds about right for any post on any social media involving kids - half the population thinks anyone with kids should be able to do whatever tf they want, include getting their piss diapers all over your lunch, the other half thinks anyone with kids needs to be locked away in their homes and never come out in public... and the few reasonable ones who are in the middle/nonextremeist in their views are smart enough not to comment on the dumpster fire and just keep eating their popcorn \ud83d\ude02"]}
