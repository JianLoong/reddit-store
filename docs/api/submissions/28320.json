What he does is set up a table & BBQ in the estate and then just gets to cooking. The thing is, he also sells rum slushies which is his most popular product, and when it starts to get late there\u2019s always a bunch of random drunk adults acting like idiots right outside my flat.

He got arrested because he didn't have proper permits. That has nothing to do with you.", "Good grief, of course you're NTA. So what if it was \"only on a Friday\"? It was still bothersome! Most places have noise ordinances, so there's that. Plus selling alcohol like he did could get him into big trouble (minors could easily have got it). And having drunks staggering around is dangerous, and can lead to fights and assaults. \n\nYour neighbor can \"do something he likes\" by getting a job at a Jamaican restaurant.", "NTA - he was selling food & liquor without a license.

You're paying to have a peace and quiet, while obeying the laws like everyone else - he chose not to and it could have ended up much worse, especially if he decided to expand it past just Friday nights.
