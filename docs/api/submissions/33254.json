We pay the bills and utilities but the house is in my name (gift from my grandparents to me). \n\nMy husband had a minimum wage job so i contributed more towards our bills. I make enough to live comfortably. My husband had a lot of debts so his savings went towards it after his death and i only received his clothes and shoes. \n\nAnyway, 2 months ago a lady and a child came to my house introducing themselves as my husband\u2019s child and the child\u2019s aunt. The child is 5. I didn\u2019t believe them initially but they had proof to back up everything. I\u2019m obviously devastated because my husband definitely cheated on me. \n\nThe child\u2019s mom passed away few years ago and she lives with her aunt. My husband kept this a secret from me and has been sending them money every month. but after his death it\u2019s stopped. \n\nSo, the lady is asking me to pay her money to take care of kid or I should take her in because the lady has 6 kids of her own and she only managed to do it with my husband sending her money. \n\ni refused to give them money and take in the kid. i know the child is innocent but i can\u2019t look at her without feeling betrayed and hurt so i told them to leave me alone and never come back. \n\nthe lady is threatening me saying she would put the kid up for adoption but i don\u2019t care because it\u2019s not my child and my husband is a cheating scumbag.\n\nmy family is on my side. but my in laws (husband\u2019s parents) want me to raise the child or at least send money because that\u2019s what my husband would\u2019ve wanted. they\u2019re both really old so they can\u2019t take care of a 5 yr old. i told them it\u2019s not my place to raise someones child who is also the product of an affair. \n\nthey\u2019re calling me the AH for being heartless and ruining a kid\u2019s life.", "created_utc": 1702864997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kxih3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_raise_my_husbands_child/", "score": 2146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's the legal guardian and she has a responsibility to figure it out financially. She took that responsibility willingly. Parents die all the time and child support stops.
