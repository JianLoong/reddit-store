Whether or not she is, she will, and your wife is letting her.", "Hate to break it to you, but your problem isn't your in laws, it's your wife. You're working two jobs to support her family. It should be on her, not you. If she wants to be a doormat to her family, fine, but she doesn't push that responsibility on you.\n\nYou don't have the means, she'll work you to death and beyond so she can do whatever her family wants and needs. If she won't involve you in any of the decisions then she doesn't get to be involved with the ones you make.\n\nYou and this relationship have no future if she won't tell her family no.", " Unless OPs father was sick and being cared for solely by OP inheritance is a gift but not exactly hard earned.", "You don't have the means. Don't feel guilty. Stop supporting them, your own family is suffering because of it.", "You had every right to call the cops because your MIL stole from your account.", "Hard to know for sure as laws in other countries vary widely.", "I find it pretty hard to believe that OP would have given MIL the pin-- I highly suspect that either wife gave the PIN or MIL watched wife entering the PIN.", "If a PIN is used the bank is unlikely to pursue it as fraud (at least in the US).  It's up to the account holder to secure the PIN.", "You are already having to work 2 jobs and this is alienating you from your own family.", "It complicates the situation for the wife, but not OP. It would leave OP's hands clean (he couldn't be accused of blindsiding her).\n\nThe wife would have been forced to reveal her true feelings and loyalty. If she warned her mother, OP would know that his in-laws matter more than him. If she didn't say anything or if she supported OP, OP would know that his wife finally decided to have his back.\n\nIf the wife warned her mother, they could:\n- Give the money back (sometimes people stash money while mushing from others, or she could have asked the money from family members if they refused they couldn't claim OP for doing the same);\n\nThe mother could have run from the police and not returned to the house fearing OP called the police again;\n\n- Or the mother would have faced the police anyway.\n\nIf the wife didn't tell her mother about the police, the mother would be so upset with her daughter that (hopefully) would live in the house and seek housing with someone else. \n\nAs far as I see it, all three outcomes are beneficial to OP and prejudicial to OP's wife (she deserves the heat).", "I think mil watch the pin. I dont think they gave it to her", "Again not true I worked for a bank in the US for MANY MANY years and this happens ALL THE TIME. Example a grandson used his grandmothers card and pin and she wants the money back because she did not authorize the withdrawl and that can only happen if she files a police report for fraud the bank will in fact credit her back IF she follows all the legal channels. I dealt with these situations on a daily basis. If the person was not the account holder,pin used or not its fraud and the account holder MUST file a police report for the bank to do anything.", "Like I said, I agree that he should have told his wife first, but I don't think him not telling her rises to the moniker of asshole.", "Again, depends on the bank.", "Im sure it does but this was the standard practice at more than one bank. You have to understand that sometimes pins can be guessed especially by family members and then debit cards stolen and it would not be right to punish the victim of the theft. Thats the whole reason they must go police route for reimbursment. Some people dont want to do that because \u201cFaMiLy\u201d and then are upset they cant get their money back because at that point the bank doesnt care because clearly you dont if you choose not to go through the proper channels. Banks generally have an entire department dedicated to this kind of thing especially because scammers can get your pin when you use it in stores so just having the pin doesnt really mean it wasnt fraud.", "OP\u2019s wife couldn\u2019t have been dumb enough to think that he wants a second job for fun? And also that her OWN medical bills need to be prioritised? And OP did tell her that money was very tight because of all the bills he had to pay and said no. It was in the opening post. His wife just ignores it or also deaf on top of being dumb to not understand no?"]}
