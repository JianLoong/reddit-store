{"id": 14612, "submission_id": "12jpm4c", "title": "AITA for cancelling on family vacation after my newly widowed mom decides to bring her new boyfriend?", "selftext": "My dad lost his 1.5 year battle with cancer one year ago (April 2022) at only 62 yrs old. He and my mom were married for 31 years. The few months before my dad got sick he and my mom were not on great terms and were contemplating divorce. However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nI miss him every day. Me and my mom had always been pretty close but since my dad died I feel like I'm seeing and talking to her less and less these days and it makes me sad.\n\n**In August of 2022 (4 months after my Dad passed) my mom started seeing someone.** She'd call him her \"friend\", slip in mentions of him in conversation but I personally wanted NOTHING to do with him. (Still don't.) I thought it was TOO SOON and told her so.\n\nEveryone grieves differently and dating after losing a spouse is hard but conversations I've attempted with this guy and the chemistry between them has been super awkward IMO. I feel like she's disregarding any feelings or push-back that me, my sister and extended family have about this relationship. (large extended family, all very close-knit).\n\nShe has now starting bringing him to events and parties and there is an awkward vibe when he's around. Nobody wants to say it outloud. This past week, he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party (at my parents house). My mom knew he was coming and did not mention to anyone. Following tradition - we stood in prayer before we ate dinner and my uncle prayed out loud for those who we have lost and I felt SO awkward that my mom's boyfriend was there, holding hands with my family as we talked about my Dad, in my Dad's house, almost only a year to the day that he died.\n\nWe're now booking flights for a large family vacation in June (condo has already been booked for MONTHS) and my mom casually mentioned at Easter that she's bringing her boyfriend. I didn't hear this at the time and found out later from a cousin. I immediately called and told her my feelings about him going (I don't want him to) and she completely changed the subject and did not acknowledge what I told her at all. \n\nNot to mention, we had decided to leave a day early to save money on flights, but now that her boyfriend is going, it will actually cost me MORE because we will no longer be splitting the costs that we originally planned since they will be doing things separately.\n\nMoney is not the problem though. It's now principle to me. Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her. He WILL be staying in the same condo and we are going to have to tip-toe around this awkward situation for an entire week while we should be relaxing and enjoying family time together.\n\n**AITA for wanting to cancel on the family vacation and/or stick to my guns about not wanting her boyfriend to go even though she already booked his flight?**", "created_utc": 1681313108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jpm4c/aita_for_cancelling_on_family_vacation_after_my/", "score": 1305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents marriage was over.  If they were together for 31 years and talking divorce, dude it\u2019s been over for awhile.   She sucked it up because he was dying.  It\u2019s an awkward vibe because instead of being mature and being happy your mom found someone who makes her happy, you guys are refusing to be open.", "YTA. Sounds like your mom put aside the reasons she wanted to divorce your dad to be there for him in his time of need and to honor their 31 years together.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read on Reddit how many men abandon their spouses when they get diagnosed with cancer. Your mom stayed until the end for him, even though the marriage was done. \n\nShe stayed with him through his cancer and helped him and now what, you\u2019re mad that she has a chance at happiness again? How many years of her life does she have to sacrifice before you decide it\u2019s ok for her to be happy? \n\n1-2 years to nurse him, 1 year to grieve- that\u2019s already at least 3 years of sacrifice for an older woman who wanted to be free and have a better life. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think of her boyfriend. My own mom is dating someone I don\u2019t like but I\u2019m not going to say shit because he makes her happy. And yes I\u2019m going on an awkward family trip with them. \n\nBe a better child to your mom, goddamn", "Info: do you have any other issues with this man besides that you don't think your mom grieved enough?", "YTA. Grow up. Your mother and father were already contemplating divorce, she stayed with him through his illness anyway. She didn't move on too quickly or do anything wrong. I'm sorry for your loss, but seriously, your mother deserves to be happy.", "YTA. You said yourself they were having martial problems before your dad's illness. Your mother did right by him and cared for him, but the issues were still there, just \"squashed\" as you called it. It makes sense that she moved on faster than you because her relationship with him was different than yours. He was your dad, but for her, he was a husband who she was considering divorcing. \n\nIf this new man treats her well and makes her happy, just be happy for her. Don't you think she deserves to be happy?", "So what you need to understand is, the more you push this new bf away, the more you're pushing your mom away.  Your mom pushed down the issues she had with your Dad so his last years on earth could be good ones. This does not mean they didn't still have issues with each other, that would be in her mind during that time.  You also do not know what they'd talked about, had agreed on and were ok with.  Your Dad might have wanted her to move on and find company/companionship after he passed away.\n\nPlease go get therapy, carrying around all this anger is not helping you.\n\nNAH, no one here is TA. You are all still very much greiving and it is damn hard. I lost my Dad due to a long term illness and yes I got angry at lots of things.  I think you are targeting the BF because it is easy too.     Will having him along on the trip make your mom happy? Yes. So just suck it up she has gone through enough already.", "YTA. There is *no* consideration for your mom\u2019s feelings in your post, at all. She was ready to divorce your father, her marriage was over in her mind, and she still stayed with him when he got sick, taking care of him. Now she wants to try and move on and her whole family is being completely unsupportive. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about your feelings, it\u2019s about hers.", "I'm sorry,  but YTA, you are an adult and are CHOOSING to make this awkward.  You already admitted that your parents' marriage was ending long before he passed. \n\nWould be N T A if it were only about you paying more than you agreed,  but you already said that is not the issue.", ">Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her.\n\nIs this fact? Or like your inference of the situation?", "NAH\n\nI think that you should let up on your mum though, it's likely her marriage with your dad was over a good bit before he died and so she is probably in a different place in her grieving process than you think she \"should\" be.\n\nThat being said she also needs to respect where you are in your grief and recognise that while she is comfortable moving on, it will naturally make someone's child feel uncomfortable if they see them being \"replaced\".\n\nIf you aren't comfortable going on the trip though it would be best to not go imo. Talk to your mum about it though, don't do it out of spite.\n\nETA: thanks very much for the award guys!", "Do what you want. I am sorry for your loss. However, your father died, not your mother and she's entitled to move forward with her life whether you like it or not.", "YTA. It is no way your place to judge when it's an appropriate time for your mother to start a new relationship after the passing of her previous spouse. \n\nYour grief as a son has nothing to do with her grief as a wife. And frankly, with all due respect, it sounds like she had checked out of that marriage long before he passed. It's admirable that they decided to stay together and that she supported him through his illness, and I sincerely hope they both enjoyed that time together. But she has every right to date and to find someone new to share her life with. She doesn't need your or anyone else's approval and doesn't have to respond to your \"pushback\". You're an adult. She's done raising you, and it's ok for her to prioritize herself for once. \n\nAll your nonsense about their chemistry is completely out of line. It's not for you to judge if they make a good couple; that's for them to decide. You are entitled to not liking the guy, and to not wanting to spend time with him, but then all you can do is remove yourself from events where he'll be present, not expect or demand that he is excluded. And by the way, that's not your dad's house. It's her damn house too, her house only now, and she can invite whoever she wants in. \n\nI am not sure how true it is that no one in the family likes or wants him around, coming from you. But in any case, it's for everyone else to establish their stand and to act accordingly. \n\nYou have no right to cancel the family trip unilaterally. Stay home if you want, but the rest of the family will do what they want. And if they want to put their alleged dislike aside as a kindness to your mother, up to them. \n\nIt's sad that instead of supporting each other, you've decided that now is the time to act like a selfish brat and make things awkward for everyone because your mother isn't sitting home alone all day the way you expect her to do.", "We just went through this with my FIL and I understand how hard it can be. He moved on seemingly quickly from his 50 year happy marriage, similar to the way your mother did, mostly because he had pre-grieved the situation (she was sick for a few years). He unfailingly cared for her and he seems happy in his new relationship.\n\nWe had some tough conversations with him. We asked him to respectfully omit her from events in the first year that had to do with us grieving the loss of my MIL, specifically her birthday, the anniversary of her death, and the first Christmas after her passing.\n\nHe was angry about this. Talked about how he needed support also, which is valid. But we felt entitled to grieve as a family at certain specific times without her replacement lurking about. So ultimately, he agreed.\n\nSince then, we've hung out with her quite a bit and are settling into a new normal where she is generally present. \n\nI think that perhaps you've gone a little too far on the pushback side of the spectrum. The situation is not going to get less awkward unless you actually try to get past your prejudices and spend some time with this person. At the very least, if they are making your mom happy, you owe it to your mother to try.\n\nSensible boundaries are ok. I think asking your mom to make you aware of when her partner is going to present is reasonable. I think asking your mom to not bring her partner for events that specifically celebrate/memorialize your father may also be reasonable, so the family can be united in its loss.\n\nBut rage-quitting on the trip just because her partner is going to be there seems a little extreme to me.\n\nI would gently suggest that some grief counseling may be in order. You have some anger about the loss of your father still that seems to be coming out in this situation.\n\nGentle YTA.", "YTA.   Damn you really suck.  Your mom put her whole life on hold to take care of a man who she wanted to divorce and she was there with him through all of it.   Now that she has a chance to move on and find some happiness YOU don't like it?!?!  It's to soon?!?  To soon for what?  For her to be happy and do what she wants?  For you to act like a 5 year old?!  Get over yourself and realize that your mom deserves happiness.", "YTA\n\nYou admit that your parents were close to divorcing.  Just because she stepped up and took care of him during his illness and death doesn't mean either of their feelings changed.  It could have been just kindness and practicality.  \n\nShe has every right to move on. I you don't want to go on th trip, don't go. But quit punishing your mom for having a life. Just because she took care of him doesn't mean they were back together.", "It's your mum's life and if she is happier that way, good for her.", "YTA. When I was ready to divorce my husband, I was done with him. I'd spent years grieving the relationship we no longer had and was ready to move on. He didn't wrong me as in cheating or abusing me, but he was a total dick to me constantly, starting fights all the time, and refusing to engage with keeping up our home anymore. Hard to find a man attractive when you're treated like their mom, and then on top of that, they're not even appreciative of anything that you do to care for them. \n\nYour parents didn't come together because they suddenly loved each other through your father's diagnosis, you're mother didn't want to be a dick and leave a dude who had nobody else to take care of him through a severe illness. Definitely don't see anywhere in your post where you express stepping up. Just because you don't love someone romantically anymore doesn't mean you suddenly stop caring about making sure they're alive and well, you just transition your relationship into a friendship or amicable partnership. \n\nYou were not in your parents relationship, you don't have the details of why they were separating or what went on, and you as a child have no place to inject yourself there. Do you want your mother to find happiness? Or are you trying to spite her on behalf of your dad and punish her for daring to try and leave him? \n\nI'm also curious how much actual awkwardness there is, or if you're reading into everybody else's behavior because you feel uncomfortable with the fact that your mom is in love with someone who isn't your dad.", "NTA for being uncomfortable and therefore cancelling on the trip. But your mom can grieve/date however she wants.", "NAH- your mom is allowed to move on. It sounds like their marriage was over long before he passed away. It\u2019s perfectly okay for her to have a boyfriend. \n\nYou are also perfectly okay to not feel comfortable about going on a vacation with someone you aren\u2019t comfortable with. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to bow out of the vacation, that\u2019s your decision and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong to do so.", "I'm gonna say soft YTA. You're still grieving, I've been there, buried my mom, grandma, and my brother, and you have every right to grieve how you choose. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you're offended that your mother is moving on, like she's just replacing your father so soon after his death. You're family are assholes too. I'll break it down like this:\n\n1. You're the asshole because your mother is moving on and you don't like it, which is just selfish. I understand you miss your dad, but you can't expect your mom to just put her life on hold and spend the rest of her life alone.\n2. Your family are assholes because like you, they're holding on to a memory of a person who isn't there and it sounds like they think your mother finding a new man is either insulting or disrespectful to your father.\n\nYour mother is moving on, that is what people do. It sounds like she gave you all warning she was seeing someone before you met him and honestly, although you said you've attempted, I think you approached this man with the idea he's trying to replace your father, which neither he or anyone could do, so your view of him was already skewed.\n\nAs far as the trip goes, your mother wanting her boyfriend to accompany her is not a huge ask. Think for a second that she lost her husband to cancer, and although you stated they were in a rough patch and heading towards divorce, she still lost the man she loved. This new man is probably more than just a new boyfriend. Maybe he offers her comfort. Maybe he has been a shoulder for her. Maybe she saw her children grieving their father and rather than add to their sadness, she put on a front for you while she cried in secret, or turned to a friend who listened and that grew into something more.\n\nYou need to take your mom to lunch or coffee and really talk about this. I also think you should look into grief counseling, maybe for you and your mother.\n\nI hope you all find your peace and are able to get past this.", "NAH\nI'm sorry you lost your dad. I'm sorry your mom gave years to stand by a man she didn't love and who didn't love her and is now being ostracized. I'm sorry for how much you all must be hurting. :( \n\nGrieving is hard. I hope you all find peace and healing.", "YTA.  Your mom is her own person, and is able to move on with her life as she feels is best.  Sounds like she's a damn decent person for caring for your dad til the end despite their struggles and failing marriage prior to his diagnosis.  And if the struggles were open by then, chances are there were problems brewing behind the scenes prior you may not have been aware of.  \n\nWhy can't you just be happy for your mom?   Doesn't she deserve to be happy in life?   And imagine her new partners feelings- he's coming Into what sounds like a very cold and judgemental family situation where he probably knows he isn't liked but he's doing it because he likes your mom.   You can grieve your loss as long as you need- trust me I'm there too!  But life does go on.", "All I'm reading about you and your family's feelings. Not your mum's and I think that's sad. I'm sorry for your loss, but YTA.", "NAH. If you don't want to go, then don't go. Better that than you go and spoil the fun with your attitude.

She put aside whatever feelings she had to do so.\n\nIt hurts now, yes... but she was already done with the marriage, they both were. You got a few months of them together at the end. Your mother did so much for your dad, but she deserves to have her own happiness.\n\nShe's isn't betraying your father.", "YTA. Did you ever think the reason why boyfriend is so awkward is because your family is so cold towards him. I know you miss your dad, but it seems like your parents marriage was over well before you were made aware of it. Your mom is a saint for putting their differences aside to take care of him. Is there anything beside boyfriends awkwardness that makes you not like him? Is he mean? Rude? Unkind? What does the rest of the family say about him, because you gave no examples?", "ESH\n\nYou're allowed to grieve how you want and it's definitely okay to be uncomfortable with someone that your mother keeps insisting to bring to family functions. \nThat being said your mom is also allowed to grieve how she sees fit especially when before your dad got sick they were discussing divorce.  \n\nI think you and the rest of your family needs to sit down with her and discuss your feelings and maybe ask her to slow down trying to integrate this person in the family.", "wow, I really can\u2019t believe ppl are actually saying YTA lol.

Your mom is allowed to take as long or as little as she wants to move forward with her life. You said it yourself the they were in the brink of divorce.\n\nI'm a widow too. Six months after my late boyfriend died I was pregnant. I think you're a bitch for judging her", "YTA. Your mom doesn't need your or family members permission to date.

And I'm so sorry you're going through that.\n\nBut.\n\nIf you can be mature enough to separate your grief from the situation for a minute - think about your mom.  She's had a rough go of it, too.  Being a full time caregiver for a person you were on the verge of divorcing is not easy.  She put aside her feelings to do what she thought was right - taking care of your father - even though that was probably incredibly hard on her physically and emotionally.  And now she's lost someone she loves, is in a different financial, social and relational place.

My mom dating again was tough and I harbored a lot of resentment towards my moms boyfriend and felt more or less exactly like you did, its too soon, no-one really wants him here, its a weird vibe, etc. I was less mature so those thoughts basically manifested into \"fuck this dude\" but... I was wrong. And you might be too. All of those things, those issues were on me. I felt that way because I was hurting and it wasn't fair to him. 11 years later and I have nothing but respect and admiration for him as an individual and as my moms boyfriend. He never replaced my dad but he is a good man and I only figured that out when I set aside my own grief enough to let him become a part of my life and I am glad I did.

She literally cared for your father despite her own needs and wants for over a year - that is pretty cool.

He and my mom were married for 31 years. The few months before my dad got sick he and my mom were not on great terms and were contemplating divorce. However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nI miss him every day. Me and my mom had always been pretty close but since my dad died I feel like I'm seeing and talking to her less and less these days and it makes me sad.\n\n**In August of 2022 (4 months after my Dad passed) my mom started seeing someone.** She'd call him her \"friend\", slip in mentions of him in conversation but I personally wanted NOTHING to do with him. (Still don't.) I thought it was TOO SOON and told her so.\n\nEveryone grieves differently and dating after losing a spouse is hard but conversations I've attempted with this guy and the chemistry between them has been super awkward IMO. I feel like she's disregarding any feelings or push-back that me, my sister and extended family have about this relationship. (large extended family, all very close-knit).\n\nShe has now starting bringing him to events and parties and there is an awkward vibe when he's around. Nobody wants to say it outloud. This past week, he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party (at my parents house). My mom knew he was coming and did not mention to anyone. Following tradition - we stood in prayer before we ate dinner and my uncle prayed out loud for those who we have lost and I felt SO awkward that my mom's boyfriend was there, holding hands with my family as we talked about my Dad, in my Dad's house, almost only a year to the day that he died.\n\nWe're now booking flights for a large family vacation in June (condo has already been booked for MONTHS) and my mom casually mentioned at Easter that she's bringing her boyfriend. I didn't hear this at the time and found out later from a cousin. I immediately called and told her my feelings about him going (I don't want him to) and she completely changed the subject and did not acknowledge what I told her at all. \n\nNot to mention, we had decided to leave a day early to save money on flights, but now that her boyfriend is going, it will actually cost me MORE because we will no longer be splitting the costs that we originally planned since they will be doing things separately.\n\nMoney is not the problem though. It's now principle to me. Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her. He WILL be staying in the same condo and we are going to have to tip-toe around this awkward situation for an entire week while we should be relaxing and enjoying family time together.\n\n**AITA for wanting to cancel on the family vacation and/or stick to my guns about not wanting her boyfriend to go even though she already booked his flight?**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Regardless of how it may have seemed to you, to me it sounds like their marriage was emotionally over prior to his death, they just looked passed it because of the unfortunate circumstances. \n\nHave you ever thought that the awkward feeling you have around him is because *you* are making it awkward? It doesn't sound like she or her boyfriend are trying to replace your dad, she's just simply moving on with her life and being happy. You need to grow up and let your mom live her life.", "YTA. Can\u2019t you see that their marriage was over before your dad died, and she stayed with him out of obligation, not love? She deserves a chance at happiness and and you should be there to support her.", "Yta, you don\u2019t get to tell someone how they are supposed to feel. She gets to move on or grieve at her pace, you yours. Judy because you are not ready to move on doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t get too.", "ESH. Your mother for springing her boyfriend on everyone as an addition to the vacation, especially given the plans to save money etc.\n\nYou for expecting your mother to still grieve your father when their marriage was already over way before he died. For you it has been a year since your father died. Her marriage was long over at this point, but she stayed with him for his last months.\n\nDo you have anything substantial against this guy? Did anything happen? Or is everything just expecting her to grieve or hasn't warmed up yet to the guy, interests just not aligning?", "Everyone grieves differently INCLUDING your mom. You have no right to dictate when she can date or if she can bring her partner over. As people pointed out, she already wanted to leave him and chose to sacrifice her time and energy being his caretaker. Your mother is an amazing person and there may have been even pressure from others for her to stay with him through it all. Did you ever have a talk with her about it?  \n YTA. Your mom deserves to love again. How old are you even?", "YTA, absolutely. You're being a selfish and non-supportive child. It's not your place to decide when and who she dates, just as it wouldn't be her place to choose your lovers. Your awkwardness is your problem, and it's entirely in your head. He's her significant other, so of course she brings him to events and on vacations.", "Agree. It\u2019s not awkward because the new man in the mothers life is awkward. It\u2019s awkward because everyone in this l family has an opinion about who and when this grown woman is allowed to date. The OP and the family decided her new partner is awkward and that\u2019s a good enough reason to thinly veil their judgmental attitude.  Mom is being punished for moving on in her life while everyone wants her to put on a grieving widow act\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter how the mom feels at all. All OP and his family care about is how they feel and how they\u2019re grieving without even considering the mother.  YTA, indeed.", "Hopping on to also add that OP is in the middle of ending a long term relationship and planning to go on a solo cruise. That seems a bit hypocritical to me. Judging her mom when her herself is moving on from her relationship so quickly planning vacations? YTA", "OP doesn't realize that their mother spared them and their sibling the burden of taking care of a dying father. That's an incredible gift. Instead of being grateful, they're angry she's moving on.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like there's anything awkward except OP's opinions. How is it awkward that the family remembers those they've lost? It's not like mom's bf had a hand in their father's death.\n\nI don't get some people. OP is being selfish and self-centered.", "Ehh, having lost a parent I understand why it's hard to be \"mature and happy.\" Mom has had time to grieve both Dad AND the marriage, and was probably grieving the loss of rhe marriage before the cancer was even diagnosed. The kids saw the marriage as having been repaired. \n\nThe kids absolutely need to accept the man as part of their mother's life, but that'll take effort on their part. They're AHs for guilting her about him, but not for having a hard time letting go and moving on.", "Aside from the part where you already start grieving as the person is dying. I nursed someone with terminal cancer for two years. When they died, I didn't cry. People called me heartless, but none of them were there for every single hospital visit and every new bit of devastating news. I slept in a chair in hospice and saw this person draw their last breath, panicked and confused and a shell of who they'd been. No, I didn't cry when they died. I was just glad it was over, for the both of us. I'd cried enough.", ">Sounds like your mom put aside the reasons she wanted to divorce your dad to be there for him in his time of need and to honor their 31 years together.\n\nI think this is the crucial bit.  She didn't move on from her beloved husband in a couple of months, her marriage ended like 2 years before she started seeing the new guy, just on amicable enough terms that she didn't want to leave him alone during his terminal illness.  I get the family being a bit uncomfortable with it, but it's wrong to think she started dating too soon after the death of someone who was more of her friend/ex than her husband.", "OP's poor mom got trapped into becoming a caretaker for a person that she actively wanted to leave. It's incredibly hard to be a primary caretaker when you genuinely love someone. I can't even wrap my head around the mental and emotional strain she must have been under to be his caretaker. \n\nI can tell you without hesitation that if my ex had told me he had a terminal diagnosis while we were in the divorce process, I would have done everything in my power to make sure he had his family's support. I would have driven him and all of his stuff to his parent's or sibling's home, I would make sure insurance was all sorted so he'd be able to maintain coverage. I would have made sure everything possible was taken care of from a scheduling and paperwork standpoint. But no way in hell would I have stuck around to be his caretaker for an unknown amount of time. She's a far better person than I am, and she deserves every bit of happiness she can get.", "I couldn't agree more.  I'm in a similar position - my mom nursed my dad for years and within a year of his death met a widower.  My siblings and I all felt the loss of her company as she spent more time with him.  But she was so happy.  And she had taken good care of our dad.  So we all sucked it up because OUR MOM WAS HAPPY.  That's what matters.  Being a caregiver is hard - and your mom did it when she wasn't happily married.  Now we all actually kind of like the new (old) guy.  It's not about you!  Let mom be happy!", "> However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nOP is for sure assuming and romanticizing this part. This, while maybe true, does not automatically equal a happy and loving marriage that they are committed to each other like they are newlyweds again.\n\n>Sounds like your mom put aside the reasons she wanted to divorce your dad to be there for him in his time of need and to honor their 31 years together.\n\nThat's exactly what it means and OP doesn't realize the difference or how amazing their mom is for it. She may not have hated her husband, but that is not the basis of a marriage. She may have cared for him, but that's because he was still a husband for many years and the father of her children. Of course she would feel an obligation to care for such a man and willingly do it.\n\nNone of this means that she and probably him, didn't consider the actual marriage over. Especially if medical decisions needed to be made, staying married probably made care significantly easier and kept OP from having to deal with way more than they already did.\n\nOP's mom has been emotionally divorced for a while even if not legally. She did OP and her husband a great service and showed great commitment to her family. I can understand OP's emotional reaction, but if they continue throwing a tantrum like an emotional child unable to handle that their parents don't love each other as husband and wife anymore, they are a massive asshole.", "Also she didn\u2019t invite them to OPs \u2018parents\u2019 house, she invited him to HER house and HER home. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to like the guy, but they do need to get over themselves. Their mothers relationship is her relationship and a family vacation with 20+ people where the will also be going off doing their own thing is kinda minor. If you can\u2019t ignore 1 out of 20+ people in a room who\u2019s not actively trying to get your attention they sound like they have main character syndrome.", "I skimmed their post history. I wonder if op has some misplaced projections of their cheating bf and is linking that to their mom moving on.

Maybe  OP needs to reflect on their own relationships before judging everybody else's.", "I was about to say NTA but you convinced me to say NAH since I can see why her mom is not the asshole.

She is disregarding their grief and setting her partner up to be hated and resented by her children. A family friend had a similar situation and a decade later his children still hate this woman so much he usually has to visit them on his own. The first Easter after dad's death is not the time to force them to accept one's new Beau. And a week long vacation IN THE SAME HOUSE is not a good time to force the issue.

And now she still get treated as if she does something horrible. \n\nI wonder... how much did the children and family who give her side eyes, took over of the care of the late husband?", "OP mom was probably counted down the days until he died. She was probably relieved when he did pass, being a caregiver is hard. Being a caregiver to someone you wanted to divorce is extremely hard", "I think the fact the mom stayed to be the primary caretaker shows the love she has for their children (even OP, bless their judgemental heart) who would have had to step up to be the primary caretakers, should the mom go forth with the divorce... And only secondly, it shows the respect she had for her marriage and husband. \nThe fact the mom sacrificed and is now getting judged and still told to put her happiness on hold because it makes \"the family \" uncomfortable shows how selfish the others are. \nOP be better!", "I just looked. You might be on to something. She feels stuck so she doesn\u2019t want her mom to move on.

I\u2019m doing exactly that- taking time off work and paying my own money to go on a trip I don\u2019t even want to go on so that my mom can be happy. Family trips are rare for us so it\u2019s worth it, even though I don\u2019t like her new guy. He makes her smile and I\u2019m an adult who can deal with less-than-ideal situations once in a blue moon.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not willing to do that for your mom, that\u2019s fine too.

The mother does sound selfish though, inviting him to a family dinner, without telling anyone.", "This. Thank you for this response. This is very much where I am coming from. I mostly understand everyone else's opinions here about me needing to let my mom live her life. I'm definitely still in the process of figuring out how to do that. I definitely want her to be happy. I admit that it's taking me more time than it is my mother and/or that she is grieving differently than I am.\n\nBut my \"AITA\" question was directed toward the vacation, really, and that she sprung it on us that he was coming. I honestly am not sure when she was planning on telling me at all, if I hadn't heard from someone else at the Easter get together. \n\nIf I had an uncle that I hated and nobody told me that he was going, I'd probably be upset then too. Granted, my feelings are a little more complex in the situation of my mom and her boyfriend, so that's why I gave all the details leading up - but it's not like I want her to be miserable. I love her with all my heart. I want her to be happy. But I feel like there has to be some give and take on both ends, right? I don't want to be miserable and feel awkward either, especially on vacation. :(", "So, to be clear, OP is an asshole *for not wanting to waste their vacation with someone they don't like*?", "She is paying.", "The selfish woman who spent a year and a half taking care of a man she wanted to divorce?\n\nOP is the selfish one, their mother\u2019s boyfriend has done nothing wrong.

Because that changes a lot imho", "It doesn't sound like she's forcing a relationship though. He comes with her to events one would expect an SO to attend. There's no indication he or their mom is forcing them to get along or even hang out much, just accept him being Around.", "How on earth is bringing your bf to family events \"forcing\" OP to have a relationship with him?", "She's not forcing anything, so that's a non sequitur. She has him in her life, which is her right. They don't have to have a relationship with them, but she has every right to include him in a dinner she is hosting, and to bring him on vacation with her.

OP sounds too focused on her mom's relationship and she can't accept that her parents' marriage was over before her dad was sick, so she had time to get over him.\n\nOn the other hand I don't get the Y T As and people saying she's not forcing him on her. You don't suddenly invite a new person on family trips if your family doesn't know/like them. And, most importantly, you don't invite them last minute without informing everyone. Same goes for dinners, etc. It's fine to have a partner after you become a widow, it's not fine to try to force a relationship between him and your daughter. She can keep them separate.

Approach that question with a fully open mind and you'll probably figure everything else out at the same time.", "Do you though? I think you need to be a bit more introspective and honest with yourself because this post is absolutely riddled with judgement of your mother trying to be happy with a new partner. I get that is hard to see a surviving parent move on, however she deserves to be happy and not just on your terms and when you think it\u2019s okay. Unless this guy is truly awful- and nothing you describe indicates he is- you need to pull it together and deal with your own grief without punishing her. She\u2019s done nothing wrong.", "Unless she is being abused, her relationships are no one else's business but hers. Grow up.", "That's a perfectly valid way to feel. It probably was a shock to see a man who wasn't your father next to your mother at a family holiday celebration in your parent's house. You're absolutely entitled to feel that way.\n\nBUT... none of this has anything to do with the vacation you're talking about canceling. You don't get to decide that your mother isn't allowed to bring her new partner along just because you don't particularly care for him. If you don't want to go on the vacation because you'll feel awkward around this new person (who doesn't seem to have done anything wrong other than exist in your space) then YOU stay home. You don't dictate to your mother what she can and can't do on a vacation that is just as much HERS as it is yours.", "If you really want your mother to be happy. If that is really true. Then you can't ask her to do that on your terms. You have a responsibility to her out of love to if not welcome, then accept as a part of her life the man she chooses. And that includes not bogarting and canceling vacations because you don't want him there. How can you think that doing that will in any way make your mother happy? You're hurting her. And if what you say is true, and I'm going to believe you, then you have to stop hurting her. And that means calling her back and saying wow it's a tough adjustment for you, you think she should be able as an adult woman, to bring her partner on vacation! How will you get to know him and get comfortable with him if you don't want to spend any time around him?", "> You don't do that kind of thing for someone you'd rather see dead.\n\nEven if you love someone, it *is* a relief to finally see them die of a terminal illness. My father was a walking corpse when he was dying of pancreatic cancer, and you end up counting down the days of when that living hell will end.", "Pretty much all of them.  It's a hard truth that people in awful positions are just desperately waiting for them to be over.  Even if they willingly put themselves in that position, even if they hate feeling that way.  It's just a somewhat icky part of human nature.", "Death is complex, its not odd to be relieved someone is gone if you had a sour relationship. Sometimes even in good relationship the caregiver is relieved because it is over, and they can take a break.\n\nSometimes death gives all the emotions, relationships are complex and when someone leaves you can feel a lot of things besides sadness.", "Ah yes the OP is the problem, even tho the whole family does not want the guy there, maybe the mom should read the room and realize maybe its too soon and people aren't comfortable with her new boyfriend yet. She moved on, but it doesn't seem like the rest of the family did.\n\n\\*quick edit   \nThe too soon was in reference to bringing her boyfriend to every family gathering", "The OP is an asshole for not wanting to waste their vacation time hanging out with someone they don't like?", "And if OP was stating that they wanted only family to be on the family vacation then that would be NTA. But OP is making it clear that their issue is that their mother is dating someone else only 1 year after their father passing.  OP is demanding their mother to still be grieving for a husband that they wanted to divorce 2.5 years ago.  That is what is getting the YTA comments.", "Why does she need approval from the family to bring her boy friend?\n\nShe doesn't.", "I don't think I would have objected, to be honest. I would have just like to have been mentally prepared. I didn't mention that she also invited his adult daughter. That was even more of a shock. My mom blindly introduced me to her before I even knew that her boyfriend was there.", "This is an interesting point. So the question I'd then ask is is everybody in the family every year submitting their plus ones to the group for prior approval, or is that just OP doing that this year for her mom out of the blue?", "The idea that one person gets to shut down another person bringing a guest on vacation because they are \"uncomfortable\" for ANY reason doesn't really seem fair. Like, there's a world of difference between \"Mom's new boyfriend makes me uncomfortable because he's hitting on me\" versus \"Mom's new boyfriend makes me uncomfortable because I've decided my mom shouldn't be 'cheating' on my dead dad.\"\n\nAlso, there are 20 people going on this vacation - it's not like mom is inviting her bf on a cozy mother-daughter trip. \n\nIf OP can't deal with it, then she shouldn't go. But she shouldn't blame her mom and the new boyfriend for it. They're just existing!\n\nI would feel differently if OP was a minor child, but she's an adult and needs to cope with her own grief instead of getting mad at her mom for trying to be happy.", "Right? Like statistically in a group of 20 people at least one person probably at least likes that mom is happy again and has someone she can share experiences with.", "This was my reaction. I'd bet OP has told everyone who will.listen in the family how awful this guy is and they're just towing the line to avoid confrontation. Awkwardness doesn't mean dislike. I swear if I didn't know better this was written by my best friend..", "You're right! \nI just fear that OP might be too angry right now to have a calm conversation with her mother and that's why the mom might be avoiding the topic right now.", "Seriously?? My family is liberal and religious (personally agnostic) but during most big celebrations, we still all stand in a circle for prayer. The simple act of doing that is not conservative in nature", "OP still refers to mom's house as \"my parents'\" and \"my father's\" house - ignoring the whole \"our marriage is over and we're talking divorce\" vibes pre cancer as if cancer cured a broken marriage.", "Thank you for saying that. You made me cry.", "Yeah but we can call her the AH for it.", "Right?? I read that part several times about \"inviting someone to the family home without telling people\".. wait, it's HER home. Of course she can invite someone!!", "I'm not insulting you. If it comes across that way I'm sorry, and if it hurt you I'm sorry. I said either/could have/or/whatever. It's one possibility my mind came up with, but obviously I don't know if that's true or not.", "Where's the insult?", "I thought I was. I said either/or. It is not unheard of. But sometimes people don't seem to read either the OP's post clearly or misunderstood and so react to my comments like that, or people intentionally or unintentionally taking something I said as a guess to try to explain a situation very badly. I'm trying to explain myself but I'm actually tired, like physically, and I'm hella dumb.", "So true.", "Well, just because the mom moved on 2 years earlier than when the dad died, doesn't mean it's not \"too soon\" for everyone else to go along with replacing him. Esp since she doesn't seem to have any awareness around other people not yet being comfortable and is just throwing him in the mix.", "Your previous comment wasn't saying this. You're trying to sugarcoat it. There's a difference between being relieved and actually wanting them to die quickly.", "Sadly you\u2019re probably right about that hopefully seeing the opinions of everyone here may help OP cool their head a bit.", "As someone who grew up Catholic: We never did that at family celebrations, so to me: Yeah, that sounds rather conservative.", "I'd suggest that your family is probably the odd family out in this regard, most families that stand in a prayer circle are deeply religious, conservative types, in my experience. But hey, maybe my experience is with the odd ones.\n\nI will say, I grew up Catholic and didn't miss many Sunday's at church (much to my dismay), always had huge family gatherings for all holidays, and not ever did we pray in a circle or anything of the sort, that was definitely viewed as the thing that the kooky hyper-religious folks did.", "I'm from the south US.  I only have only see conservatives do it and I've visited a lot of houses.", "The way OP phrases it pisses me off too.\n\n>he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party\n\nHe didn't \"show up expectedly\". He was invited by the host! He didn't \"show up unexpectedly\" any more than OP \"showed up unexpectedly\".", "These aren't 5 year olds being asked to accept someone as a dad. These are grown ass adults being asked to accept someone as a family members partner.", "When you have a terminally ill patient you do count down the day, there is nothing wrong with that. You may do it because you dislike them, or because you want them to stop suffering. Million reasons why, but it is common to do.\n\nSo yeah OP mom was probably counted down the days until he died", "I can understand the 'weird' reaction, but I guess what I'm getting at is that just because something is religious and also something you don't understand doesn't mean it's inherently conservative", "It's because people can't separate politically conservative and socially conservative. Just because someone wants something for their family, it doesn't mean that they want to legislate that way of living to force it on everyone."]}
