{"id": 14612, "submission_id": "12jpm4c", "title": "AITA for cancelling on family vacation after my newly widowed mom decides to bring her new boyfriend?", "selftext": "My dad lost his 1.5 year battle with cancer one year ago (April 2022) at only 62 yrs old. He and my mom were married for 31 years. The few months before my dad got sick he and my mom were not on great terms and were contemplating divorce. However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nI miss him every day. Me and my mom had always been pretty close but since my dad died I feel like I'm seeing and talking to her less and less these days and it makes me sad.\n\n**In August of 2022 (4 months after my Dad passed) my mom started seeing someone.** She'd call him her \"friend\", slip in mentions of him in conversation but I personally wanted NOTHING to do with him. (Still don't.) I thought it was TOO SOON and told her so.\n\nEveryone grieves differently and dating after losing a spouse is hard but conversations I've attempted with this guy and the chemistry between them has been super awkward IMO. I feel like she's disregarding any feelings or push-back that me, my sister and extended family have about this relationship. (large extended family, all very close-knit).\n\nShe has now starting bringing him to events and parties and there is an awkward vibe when he's around. Nobody wants to say it outloud. This past week, he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party (at my parents house). My mom knew he was coming and did not mention to anyone. Following tradition - we stood in prayer before we ate dinner and my uncle prayed out loud for those who we have lost and I felt SO awkward that my mom's boyfriend was there, holding hands with my family as we talked about my Dad, in my Dad's house, almost only a year to the day that he died.\n\nWe're now booking flights for a large family vacation in June (condo has already been booked for MONTHS) and my mom casually mentioned at Easter that she's bringing her boyfriend. I didn't hear this at the time and found out later from a cousin. I immediately called and told her my feelings about him going (I don't want him to) and she completely changed the subject and did not acknowledge what I told her at all. \n\nNot to mention, we had decided to leave a day early to save money on flights, but now that her boyfriend is going, it will actually cost me MORE because we will no longer be splitting the costs that we originally planned since they will be doing things separately.\n\nMoney is not the problem though. It's now principle to me. Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her. He WILL be staying in the same condo and we are going to have to tip-toe around this awkward situation for an entire week while we should be relaxing and enjoying family time together.\n\n**AITA for wanting to cancel on the family vacation and/or stick to my guns about not wanting her boyfriend to go even though she already booked his flight?**", "created_utc": 1681313108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jpm4c/aita_for_cancelling_on_family_vacation_after_my/", "score": 8308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents marriage was over.  If they were together for 31 years and talking divorce, dude it\u2019s been over for awhile.   She sucked it up because he was dying.  It\u2019s an awkward vibe because instead of being mature and being happy your mom found someone who makes her happy, you guys are refusing to be open.", "YTA. Sounds like your mom put aside the reasons she wanted to divorce your dad to be there for him in his time of need and to honor their 31 years together.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read on Reddit how many men abandon their spouses when they get diagnosed with cancer. Your mom stayed until the end for him, even though the marriage was done. \n\nShe stayed with him through his cancer and helped him and now what, you\u2019re mad that she has a chance at happiness again? How many years of her life does she have to sacrifice before you decide it\u2019s ok for her to be happy? \n\n1-2 years to nurse him, 1 year to grieve- that\u2019s already at least 3 years of sacrifice for an older woman who wanted to be free and have a better life. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think of her boyfriend. My own mom is dating someone I don\u2019t like but I\u2019m not going to say shit because he makes her happy. And yes I\u2019m going on an awkward family trip with them. \n\nBe a better child to your mom, goddamn", "Info: do you have any other issues with this man besides that you don't think your mom grieved enough?", "YTA. Grow up. Your mother and father were already contemplating divorce, she stayed with him through his illness anyway. She didn't move on too quickly or do anything wrong. I'm sorry for your loss, but seriously, your mother deserves to be happy.", "YTA. You said yourself they were having marital problems before your dad's illness. Your mother did right by him and cared for him, but the issues were still there, just \"squashed\" as you called it. It makes sense that she moved on faster than you because her relationship with him was different than yours. He was your dad, but for her, he was a husband who she was considering divorcing. \n\nIf this new man treats her well and makes her happy, just be happy for her. Don't you think she deserves to be happy?\n\nEdited: typo", "So what you need to understand is, the more you push this new bf away, the more you're pushing your mom away.  Your mom pushed down the issues she had with your Dad so his last years on earth could be good ones. This does not mean they didn't still have issues with each other, that would be in her mind during that time.  You also do not know what they'd talked about, had agreed on and were ok with.  Your Dad might have wanted her to move on and find company/companionship after he passed away.\n\nPlease go get therapy, carrying around all this anger is not helping you.\n\nNAH, no one here is TA. You are all still very much greiving and it is damn hard. I lost my Dad due to a long term illness and yes I got angry at lots of things.  I think you are targeting the BF because it is easy too.     Will having him along on the trip make your mom happy? Yes. So just suck it up she has gone through enough already.", "YTA. There is *no* consideration for your mom\u2019s feelings in your post, at all. She was ready to divorce your father, her marriage was over in her mind, and she still stayed with him when he got sick, taking care of him. Now she wants to try and move on and her whole family is being completely unsupportive. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about your feelings, it\u2019s about hers.", "I'm sorry,  but YTA, you are an adult and are CHOOSING to make this awkward.  You already admitted that your parents' marriage was ending long before he passed. \n\nWould be N T A if it were only about you paying more than you agreed,  but you already said that is not the issue.", ">Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her.\n\nIs this fact? Or like your inference of the situation?\n\nEdit: I landed at YTA because they seem to misrepresent everyone else's vehemence.", "NAH\n\nI think that you should let up on your mum though, it's likely her marriage with your dad was over a good bit before he died and so she is probably in a different place in her grieving process than you think she \"should\" be.\n\nThat being said she also needs to respect where you are in your grief and recognise that while she is comfortable moving on, it will naturally make someone's child feel uncomfortable if they see them being \"replaced\".\n\nIf you aren't comfortable going on the trip though it would be best to not go imo. Talk to your mum about it though, don't do it out of spite.\n\nETA: thanks very much for the award guys!", "Do what you want. I am sorry for your loss. However, your father died, not your mother and she's entitled to move forward with her life whether you like it or not.", "YTA. It is no way your place to judge when it's an appropriate time for your mother to start a new relationship after the passing of her previous spouse. \n\nYour grief as a son has nothing to do with her grief as a wife. And frankly, with all due respect, it sounds like she had checked out of that marriage long before he passed. It's admirable that they decided to stay together and that she supported him through his illness, and I sincerely hope they both enjoyed that time together. But she has every right to date and to find someone new to share her life with. She doesn't need your or anyone else's approval and doesn't have to respond to your \"pushback\". You're an adult. She's done raising you, and it's ok for her to prioritize herself for once. \n\nAll your nonsense about their chemistry is completely out of line. It's not for you to judge if they make a good couple; that's for them to decide. You are entitled to not liking the guy, and to not wanting to spend time with him, but then all you can do is remove yourself from events where he'll be present, not expect or demand that he is excluded. And by the way, that's not your dad's house. It's her damn house too, her house only now, and she can invite whoever she wants in. \n\nI am not sure how true it is that no one in the family likes or wants him around, coming from you. But in any case, it's for everyone else to establish their stand and to act accordingly. \n\nYou have no right to cancel the family trip unilaterally. Stay home if you want, but the rest of the family will do what they want. And if they want to put their alleged dislike aside as a kindness to your mother, up to them. \n\nIt's sad that instead of supporting each other, you've decided that now is the time to act like a selfish brat and make things awkward for everyone because your mother isn't sitting home alone all day the way you expect her to do.", "We just went through this with my FIL and I understand how hard it can be. He moved on seemingly quickly from his 50 year happy marriage, similar to the way your mother did, mostly because he had pre-grieved the situation (she was sick for a few years). He unfailingly cared for her and he seems happy in his new relationship.\n\nWe had some tough conversations with him. We asked him to respectfully omit her from events in the first year that had to do with us grieving the loss of my MIL, specifically her birthday, the anniversary of her death, and the first Christmas after her passing.\n\nHe was angry about this. Talked about how he needed support also, which is valid. But we felt entitled to grieve as a family at certain specific times without her replacement lurking about. So ultimately, he agreed.\n\nSince then, we've hung out with her quite a bit and are settling into a new normal where she is generally present. \n\nI think that perhaps you've gone a little too far on the pushback side of the spectrum. The situation is not going to get less awkward unless you actually try to get past your prejudices and spend some time with this person. At the very least, if they are making your mom happy, you owe it to your mother to try.\n\nSensible boundaries are ok. I think asking your mom to make you aware of when her partner is going to present is reasonable. I think asking your mom to not bring her partner for events that specifically celebrate/memorialize your father may also be reasonable, so the family can be united in its loss.\n\nBut rage-quitting on the trip just because her partner is going to be there seems a little extreme to me.\n\nI would gently suggest that some grief counseling may be in order. You have some anger about the loss of your father still that seems to be coming out in this situation.\n\nGentle YTA.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nYou admit that your parents were close to divorcing.  Just because she stepped up and took care of him during his illness and death doesn't mean either of their feelings changed.  It could have been just kindness and practicality.  \n\nShe has every right to move on. I you don't want to go on th trip, don't go. But quit punishing your mom for having a life. Just because she took care of him doesn't mean they were back together.", "It's your mum's life and if she is happier that way, good for her.", "YTA. When I was ready to divorce my husband, I was done with him. I'd spent years grieving the relationship we no longer had and was ready to move on. He didn't wrong me as in cheating or abusing me, but he was a total dick to me constantly, starting fights all the time, and refusing to engage with keeping up our home anymore. Hard to find a man attractive when you're treated like their mom, and then on top of that, they're not even appreciative of anything that you do to care for them. \n\nYour parents didn't come together because they suddenly loved each other through your father's diagnosis, you're mother didn't want to be a dick and leave a dude who had nobody else to take care of him through a severe illness. Definitely don't see anywhere in your post where you express stepping up. Just because you don't love someone romantically anymore doesn't mean you suddenly stop caring about making sure they're alive and well, you just transition your relationship into a friendship or amicable partnership. \n\nYou were not in your parents relationship, you don't have the details of why they were separating or what went on, and you as a child have no place to inject yourself there. Do you want your mother to find happiness? Or are you trying to spite her on behalf of your dad and punish her for daring to try and leave him? \n\nI'm also curious how much actual awkwardness there is, or if you're reading into everybody else's behavior because you feel uncomfortable with the fact that your mom is in love with someone who isn't your dad.", "NTA for being uncomfortable and therefore cancelling on the trip. But your mom can grieve/date however she wants.", "NAH- your mom is allowed to move on. It sounds like their marriage was over long before he passed away. It\u2019s perfectly okay for her to have a boyfriend. \n\nYou are also perfectly okay to not feel comfortable about going on a vacation with someone you aren\u2019t comfortable with. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to bow out of the vacation, that\u2019s your decision and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong to do so.", "I'm gonna say soft YTA. You're still grieving, I've been there, buried my mom, grandma, and my brother, and you have every right to grieve how you choose. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you're offended that your mother is moving on, like she's just replacing your father so soon after his death. You're family are assholes too. I'll break it down like this:\n\n1. You're the asshole because your mother is moving on and you don't like it, which is just selfish. I understand you miss your dad, but you can't expect your mom to just put her life on hold and spend the rest of her life alone.\n2. Your family are assholes because like you, they're holding on to a memory of a person who isn't there and it sounds like they think your mother finding a new man is either insulting or disrespectful to your father.\n\nYour mother is moving on, that is what people do. It sounds like she gave you all warning she was seeing someone before you met him and honestly, although you said you've attempted, I think you approached this man with the idea he's trying to replace your father, which neither he or anyone could do, so your view of him was already skewed.\n\nAs far as the trip goes, your mother wanting her boyfriend to accompany her is not a huge ask. Think for a second that she lost her husband to cancer, and although you stated they were in a rough patch and heading towards divorce, she still lost the man she loved. This new man is probably more than just a new boyfriend. Maybe he offers her comfort. Maybe he has been a shoulder for her. Maybe she saw her children grieving their father and rather than add to their sadness, she put on a front for you while she cried in secret, or turned to a friend who listened and that grew into something more.\n\nYou need to take your mom to lunch or coffee and really talk about this. I also think you should look into grief counseling, maybe for you and your mother.\n\nI hope you all find your peace and are able to get past this.", "NAH\nI'm sorry you lost your dad. I'm sorry your mom gave years to stand by a man she didn't love and who didn't love her and is now being ostracized. I'm sorry for how much you all must be hurting. :( \n\nGrieving is hard. I hope you all find peace and healing.", "YTA.  Your mom is her own person, and is able to move on with her life as she feels is best.  Sounds like she's a damn decent person for caring for your dad til the end despite their struggles and failing marriage prior to his diagnosis.  And if the struggles were open by then, chances are there were problems brewing behind the scenes prior you may not have been aware of.  \n\nWhy can't you just be happy for your mom?   Doesn't she deserve to be happy in life?   And imagine her new partners feelings- he's coming Into what sounds like a very cold and judgemental family situation where he probably knows he isn't liked but he's doing it because he likes your mom.   You can grieve your loss as long as you need- trust me I'm there too!  But life does go on.", "All I'm reading about you and your family's feelings. Not your mum's and I think that's sad.

She put aside whatever feelings she had to do so.\n\nIt hurts now, yes... but she was already done with the marriage, they both were. You got a few months of them together at the end. Your mother did so much for your dad, but she deserves to have her own happiness.\n\nShe's isn't betraying your father.", "YTA. Did you ever think the reason why boyfriend is so awkward is because your family is so cold towards him. I know you miss your dad, but it seems like your parents marriage was over well before you were made aware of it. Your mom is a saint for putting their differences aside to take care of him. Is there anything beside boyfriends awkwardness that makes you not like him? Is he mean? Rude? Unkind? What does the rest of the family say about him, because you gave no examples?", "ESH\n\nYou're allowed to grieve how you want and it's definitely okay to be uncomfortable with someone that your mother keeps insisting to bring to family functions. \nThat being said your mom is also allowed to grieve how she sees fit especially when before your dad got sick they were discussing divorce.  \n\nI think you and the rest of your family needs to sit down with her and discuss your feelings and maybe ask her to slow down trying to integrate this person in the family.", "wow, I really can\u2019t believe ppl are actually saying YTA lol.

And I'm so sorry you're going through that.\n\nBut.\n\nIf you can be mature enough to separate your grief from the situation for a minute - think about your mom.  She's had a rough go of it, too.  Being a full time caregiver for a person you were on the verge of divorcing is not easy.  She put aside her feelings to do what she thought was right - taking care of your father - even though that was probably incredibly hard on her physically and emotionally.  And now she's lost someone she loves, is in a different financial, social and relational place.

My mom dating again was tough and I harbored a lot of resentment towards my moms boyfriend and felt more or less exactly like you did, its too soon, no-one really wants him here, its a weird vibe, etc. I was less mature so those thoughts basically manifested into \"fuck this dude\" but... I was wrong. And you might be too. All of those things, those issues were on me. I felt that way because I was hurting and it wasn't fair to him. 11 years later and I have nothing but respect and admiration for him as an individual and as my moms boyfriend. He never replaced my dad but he is a good man and I only figured that out when I set aside my own grief enough to let him become a part of my life and I am glad I did. Him and his son have become apart of my family in their own way.", "My daddy died in Sept 2011 and Mum started dating about six months after the fact. They'd been together almost forty years.   \n\n\nI hated her boyfriends. HOWEVER, dating made it so she wasn't lonely. It gave her a bit of a new lease of life. I loved my father very much and she did too - it's not about replacing them, or disrespecting them, it's a kind of self preservation and recognising that they deserve to be happy. \n\nYTA.

I want to be clear that my judgement has nothing to do with your moms healing process, or her way of moving on from your dads passing. \n\nNTA for setting boundaries with her new partner. She is allowed to move on and find love, but this grief has affected all of you. This needs to be a clear conversation about when all of you are ready to accept him. If she wants a successful integration into the family, she needs to understand that it will take compromise on BOTH ends and genuine understanding and compassion. \n\nThat being said. You need to talk about it clearly, together. She might try to deflect, but it's unfair for her to do so.", "YTA for slagging on your mom for this, but N-T-A for feeling uncomfortable/ not wanting to go on the vacation. It sounds like the romantic marriage was long over before your dad's diagnosis, and your mom did an extraordinary act of kindness to put him at peace in his last year by caring for him. But she deserves to move on in her own way in her own time, esp. since it sounds like she had been moving on from the relationship for a while. Don't give your mom a hard time about this. You can not want to be around the guy but that's on you.", "So once she was alone after you dad passed, how often did you make an effort to go over there and check on her and support her? Going from married to alone after 30+ years and it is a devastating adjustment. Some end up feeling so alone they find comfort in someone. Plus they are older, they don\u2019t have the time we do. While my dad don\u2019t date right away, many others in his grief group did and married quickly. I do know my dad was soo fucking lonely no matter how much we involved him.

I\u2019m sorry about your loss. That is so hard and traumatic but you are not considering your mothers feelings here. Many people in their later years find relationships faster and move faster as well. This happened with both my grandpa and my aunt. And it\u2019s none of anyone\u2019s business.

Well maybe you guys should try to get to know him better and give him a chance.

She\u2019s shoving him down your throats and that\u2019s not ok. I am willing to cut her some slack because she\u2019s grieving someone she\u2019s known for her entire adult life and she\u2019s been through a lot of difficulties and hardship lately.\n\nI think you both need to work on your communication. I know you\u2019ve said she avoids talking to you about it, but could it be because you haven\u2019t been listening to her? Or are criticising her? I\u2019m not saying you are, I\u2019m just saying her perspective here is important too.\n\nWith regards to your question and the reason I gave my rating, you won\u2019t be the asshole if you back out of the holiday.

So, the 4 months is not that soon because her relationship with him was over close to **2 years** before she introduced her boyfriend.  She literally cared for your father despite her own needs and wants for over a year - that is pretty cool.  If that was my mom, I would be thankful she did that.  \n\nShe can bring her boyfriend, and everyone needs to get over it already.

I know a lot of people will say, \"just get over it\". Easier said than done. Will you be leaving a large group in the lurch if you do so? Just know and acknowledge you are pulling out because of you and your feelings, not because your Mom is doing anything wrong.   \nI suggest grief counseling or counseling in general to better process through this.", "ESH\n\nYeah, people are allowed to do whatever they want after a partner dies... but this seems to go beyond this.

It's just sad and a little gross all around.", "INFO - Is it a standard to ask permission to invite extras on the family trips or does it usually not matter? \n\nIf its normal to get approvals on added guests NTA.

He and my mom were married for 31 years. The few months before my dad got sick he and my mom were not on great terms and were contemplating divorce. However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nI miss him every day. Me and my mom had always been pretty close but since my dad died I feel like I'm seeing and talking to her less and less these days and it makes me sad.\n\n**In August of 2022 (4 months after my Dad passed) my mom started seeing someone.** She'd call him her \"friend\", slip in mentions of him in conversation but I personally wanted NOTHING to do with him. (Still don't.) I thought it was TOO SOON and told her so.\n\nEveryone grieves differently and dating after losing a spouse is hard but conversations I've attempted with this guy and the chemistry between them has been super awkward IMO. I feel like she's disregarding any feelings or push-back that me, my sister and extended family have about this relationship. (large extended family, all very close-knit).\n\nShe has now starting bringing him to events and parties and there is an awkward vibe when he's around. Nobody wants to say it outloud. This past week, he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party (at my parents house). My mom knew he was coming and did not mention to anyone. Following tradition - we stood in prayer before we ate dinner and my uncle prayed out loud for those who we have lost and I felt SO awkward that my mom's boyfriend was there, holding hands with my family as we talked about my Dad, in my Dad's house, almost only a year to the day that he died.\n\nWe're now booking flights for a large family vacation in June (condo has already been booked for MONTHS) and my mom casually mentioned at Easter that she's bringing her boyfriend. I didn't hear this at the time and found out later from a cousin. I immediately called and told her my feelings about him going (I don't want him to) and she completely changed the subject and did not acknowledge what I told her at all. \n\nNot to mention, we had decided to leave a day early to save money on flights, but now that her boyfriend is going, it will actually cost me MORE because we will no longer be splitting the costs that we originally planned since they will be doing things separately.\n\nMoney is not the problem though. It's now principle to me. Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her. He WILL be staying in the same condo and we are going to have to tip-toe around this awkward situation for an entire week while we should be relaxing and enjoying family time together.\n\n**AITA for wanting to cancel on the family vacation and/or stick to my guns about not wanting her boyfriend to go even though she already booked his flight?**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She deserves a chance at happiness and and you should be there to support her.", "Yta, you don\u2019t get to tell someone how they are supposed to feel.

Did anything happen? Or is everything just expecting her to grieve or hasn't warmed up yet to the guy, interests just not aligning?", "Everyone grieves differently INCLUDING your mom. You have no right to dictate when she can date or if she can bring her partner over. As people pointed out, she already wanted to leave him and chose to sacrifice her time and energy being his caretaker.

Your mom deserves to love again. How old are you even?", "YTA, absolutely. You're being a selfish and non-supportive child. It's not your place to decide when and who she dates, just as it wouldn't be her place to choose your lovers. Your awkwardness is your problem, and it's entirely in your head. He's her significant other, so of course she brings him to events and on vacations.", "Agree. It\u2019s not awkward because the new man in the mothers life is awkward. It\u2019s awkward because everyone in this l family has an opinion about who and when this grown woman is allowed to date. The OP and the family decided her new partner is awkward and that\u2019s a good enough reason to thinly veil their judgmental attitude.  Mom is being punished for moving on in her life while everyone wants her to put on a grieving widow act\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter how the mom feels at all.

Instead of being grateful, they're angry she's moving on.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like there's anything awkward except OP's opinions. How is it awkward that the family remembers those they've lost?

People called me heartless, but none of them were there for every single hospital visit and every new bit of devastating news. I slept in a chair in hospice and saw this person draw their last breath, panicked and confused and a shell of who they'd been. No, I didn't cry when they died.

She didn't move on from her beloved husband in a couple of months, her marriage ended like 2 years before she started seeing the new guy, just on amicable enough terms that she didn't want to leave him alone during his terminal illness.  I get the family being a bit uncomfortable with it, but it's wrong to think she started dating too soon after the death of someone who was more of her friend/ex than her husband.", "OP's poor mom got trapped into becoming a caretaker for a person that she actively wanted to leave.

I can't even wrap my head around the mental and emotional strain she must have been under to be his caretaker. \n\nI can tell you without hesitation that if my ex had told me he had a terminal diagnosis while we were in the divorce process, I would have done everything in my power to make sure he had his family's support. I would have driven him and all of his stuff to his parent's or sibling's home, I would make sure insurance was all sorted so he'd be able to maintain coverage. I would have made sure everything possible was taken care of from a scheduling and paperwork standpoint. But no way in hell would I have stuck around to be his caretaker for an unknown amount of time. She's a far better person than I am, and she deserves every bit of happiness she can get.", "I couldn't agree more.  I'm in a similar position - my mom nursed my dad for years and within a year of his death met a widower.  My siblings and I all felt the loss of her company as she spent more time with him.  But she was so happy.  And she had taken good care of our dad.  So we all sucked it up because OUR MOM WAS HAPPY.  That's what matters.  Being a caregiver is hard - and your mom did it when she wasn't happily married.  Now we all actually kind of like the new (old) guy.  It's not about you!  Let mom be happy!", "> However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.\n\nOP is for sure assuming and romanticizing this part.

She may not have hated her husband, but that is not the basis of a marriage. She may have cared for him, but that's because he was still a husband for many years and the father of her children. Of course she would feel an obligation to care for such a man and willingly do it.\n\nNone of this means that she and probably him, didn't consider the actual marriage over. Especially if medical decisions needed to be made, staying married probably made care significantly easier and kept OP from having to deal with way more than they already did.\n\nOP's mom has been emotionally divorced for a while even if not legally.

You shouldn't have yelled at her but instead both sit down and talk like adults.", "I'm going against the grain with NAH. \n\nI agree that the marriage was probably over and either the mom or the mom and dad put aside issues to deal with the medical problems. The issue lies in that she/they made everyone think they fixed their marriage and were okay. To everyone else it does feel super sudden and strange, even if it might not to her. \n\nOf course everyone grieves differently and it's her right to date as soon or as far after his death. \n\nBut I will say we have this situation in my husband's family. His maternal grandfather died after a rough medical battle and his grandma was incredibly lost. She ended up marrying someone 7 months later. Her kids (one of which is my MIL) begged her to reconsider. She has considerable assets and the new husband came from nothing and gave off slimy vibes. They are still married and it's been just over 10 years going on 15? And it's STILL a really awkward situation. New husband is insanely jealous of Grandpa's legacy (he was very much the center of the family) and hates it when grandpa is discussed and made grandma get rid of a bunch of things.  Ex- grandpa used to rebuild vintage cars and she has since gotten rid of all of them except the one my husband built with Grandpa. The new husband tried to push for it to go too but it belongs to my husband. Then mysteriously a scratch appeared down the side of it. Let me clarify- they have 4 garages and the one where all the vintage cars were kept has enough room for like 5 or 6 cars and multiple boats at the same time. Plus the other multiple garages they have- It's a huge place. The new husband also has had behavioral issues against some of us and almost got into a fist fight with my FIL 2 years ago. We all tolerate him when we have to but we don't enjoy his company. Honestly when we first started dating before I even knew all the history he creeped me out. Grandma has also privately expressed to a few people she regrets jumping into the marriage but doesn't want to leave on principal-shes very religious.\n\nAll of this to say, I just don't think we know enough about the new boyfriend and his behavior. Is he respectful of the dad's legacy? Is he trying to make an effort with the family or is he just jumping in with \"This is my home now and I'm in charge\" kind of behavior?\n\nAnd even if we knew more information about him it doesn't change the fact that even though it might not have been for the mom, this is all very sudden for everybody else. Especially kids who are still adjusting to losing their dad. Which is what led me to my NAH judgement\n\n\nEdit: I will also say though the fact that the mom is just totally discounting and shutting down any conversation about him sucks. But we also don't know the reliability of our narrator either. But it leads me to believe that she's somewhat accurate in terms of the mom not discussing or acknowledging because this trip has been in the works for months and the fact that she's just now mentioning that he's coming too leaves me believe she intentionally hid that fact. I wouldn't want to spend vacation tiptoeing around someone I'm not comfortable with either.", "NTA. Your mother can date who she wants but you are also entitled to not want to vacation with her new boyfriend one year after you father's death.

She put her life and her happiness on hold to care for him, and she has every right to find someone who makes her happy.\n\nHowever, it sounds like the real issue is that you and your sister feel like she didn't give you the time and the space you need to grieve your own loss, and you feel a little re-traumatized by having her BF around so soon.  You're not in the same place your mother is because she started moving on long before you.  Neither of you is right or wrong, and I would probably have the same reaction as you regarding him coming with you on vacation because not enough time has passed FOR YOU to feel comfortable.  \n\nI think a genuine, non-judgmental heart-to-heart between you and your mother is in order here.  I'm sure you want your mother to be happy, and I doubt very much that she wants to upset you and your sister.  I hope you can find some kind of middle ground when it comes to her BF's involvement in family activities that operates on an acceptable timeline for both of you.", "NAH. You are not wrong to feel uncomfortable with a stranger imposing upon your family holiday and vacation.

It sounds like she was ready to do so prior to your father's diagnosis but stuck around to get your family through the hard times. She probably started mourning the loss of the relationship prior to the diagnosis and when the diagnosis came she had the whole 1.5 years to mourn the upcoming loss. She hasn't lost her parent like you have. The grief is probably different. She lost a companion and it is much easier to find a new companion than it is to find a new parent. \n\nAs much as you can, please give your mom some grace. I don't think anyone wants to spend the rest of their lives alone and if she has found someone who treats her well she is fortunate. Allow yourself to feel how you are feeling but please remember your mom is a human being with complex emotions who deserve to find what makes her happy.", "NTA.

You don't want a stand-in dad coming along for your family holiday. Plus, you feel like a hostage when your mom springs her new guy on you without asking you if you'd like to get to know him better. I definitely get it. But, I also get that this is your mom's life. So, of course, she feels entitled to be in the driver's seat in her own life. She gets to feel joy rather than sorrow.

People grieve differently, just like they show love differently.)\n\nSo, I think its fine if you cancel *your* participation in the family vacation. You're an adult.

My grandfather, Ned, passed away at 61 and my grandmother, within like a year, was dating this real weird guy who was 28 years younger than him. And he was a *real weird guy.* Drove around a jet black Chevrolet Astro with mud flaps of Garfield with the words \"get off my back!\" around him. Rode around the city on a unicycle. Challenged kids to random stupid contests (pool sharking, pushup contests, bottlecap flicking matches, chess, etc) and got pretty upset if he lost, would actually try to beat them. Made his own fleece clothing, had *no* sense of humor and took everything too seriously. Loved karaoke, cowboy hats and boots, and biking. We didn't like him, and he never knew that. My grandmother would bring him *everywhere*, to every family party.\n\nMy grandmother passed away in the hospital, her final words were asking for her wedding ring between her and Ned. My family ghosted her boyfriend immediately after and he was left to grieve what I've grown to view as a late-life fling all by himself, as we gathered around each holiday as a family in each other's embrace. I don't know how he's doing now, but I've always felt incredibly guilty for how we handled it after she passed away, and how in-the-dark he was before. There was a period of time he tried calling us around the holidays to see if we were still hosting them, and on the holidays he'd ride by our house on a bike to see what was going on, and eventually he stopped and we just never heard from him again. I still wonder how he's doing, but I'll never really find out. \n\nI don't think you're the asshole for how you feel. I do think part of it's irrational; after all, to you he's the person your mom's replacing your dad with.

She's getting older, she just lost her husband of 31 years, and regardless how rocky their marriage may have been prior to, that has to hurt. I don't think she's replacing *him* with the new boyfriend, I feel she isn't used to the feeling of being alone & without a partner. It doesn't seem like she's trying to force her family to accept and like this new guy, it seems like she's bringing him along to places more as a +1, and because she likes his company. I'm sure she does like him, but just because she likes someone doesn't mean she's replacing your dad in her heart, and it definitely doesn't mean she isn't grieving or mourning his death.\n\nI *do* think you would be the asshole for how you want to express these feelings. I admit, springing him in last minute and surprising everyone by bringing him may be a bit weird, but, he makes your mom happy and you haven't posted any examples of him being abusive or manipulative, so if he makes your mom happy in her 60's, that's great. Not everybody has the same. It may be best to just accept that he makes your mom happy, even if you don't like him, and you're valid for feeling like she's betraying your father - it's tough to watch your parent just...start dating someone so quickly after your other parent's death.

Her not saying that he'll be there for easter AND the vacation until everything is said and done (and booked) shows that she knows about it being a problem for the rest of the family.

A vacation is supposed to be fun for everyone, not just one person and their SO. \n\nShe should have been upfront and just said she'll invite her new partner to the easter celebration and then talked to everyone going on the family trip whether or not they are ok with an outsider, because let's face it that's what he is to the rest, being there.

You're unhappy and probably have been for a long time up to this point. Things are finally looking up, you're about to start working on finding happiness again. Then your soon to be ex husband gets sick, terminally sick. This is the worst possible thing that could happen to you and your family. Even if you're on the verge of divorce you're heartbroken. He's still your ex husband of 31 years and the father of your children. So you decide to put your happiness on hold and take care of him in his final years. You do it for him, but you also do it for your children so don't they don't have to see the worst parts of their fathers sickness.\n\nThen after a year and a half, he passes away. \nYou grieve in your own way, having already grieved and accepted the end of your relationship over the past 1.5 years. In a few months you're ready to start dating. Your relationship has been over for 2 years at this point and you think it's acceptable to move on. You meet a man that you like and the two of you start dating. You're so happy and fulfilled after 2 years of waiting. You want to share your happiness with your daughter but you also want to be respectful of her grieving. So you start to seed the idea of new people coming into your life by introducing your friend into conversation. She reacts negatively and tells you she thinks it's too soon to move on. She refuses to get to know him and resents his very presence. You know that it's not because of who he is but rather the fact that you're dating him and she's decided that it's too soon for you to move on. Because you know yourself you know you're the one best equipped to decide if you're ready to start dating again, you keep dating your boyfriend.\n\n6 months pass and you are still dating your boyfriend. The relationship is serious and you decide to start bringing him to family events. Your family is judgemental of your decision to start dating and events are awkward because they don't try to get to know your boyfriend. But you love your family and still want to spend time with them. So you go to these events anyway in the hopes that your family will move past their grief at some point and realize that they're being unreasonable. Your boyfriend is now a part of your life and they will have to accept it eventually. \n\nA large family vacation is being planned. You plan to go because you want to spend time with your family. You also invite your boyfriend as he's important to you too and you consider your relationship serious enough to do so. Your daughter calls you and tells you she does not want your boyfriend to attend. You do not respond and change the subject. You love your daughter but it's becoming very difficult to talk to her because she won't respect your choices. You want to include her in your life but she makes it hard because she thinks she has the right to dictate your life. You've been talking to her less and less because of this and it's killing you. \n\nI hope this helps you have more empathy for your mom because you're currently treating her like garbage. You and your family are ruining your relationships with her. I would suggest both grief counseling for you and family counseling for both you and your mom. Your feelings are valid but you need to learn to deal with them appropriately. I know that you love your mom and I really hope that you put in the work to fix this relationship.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.

My mother didn't want us to be debilitated with her passing. She wanted us to move on.\n\nAfter she passed my father and I moved on relatively quickly while my sisters were a wreck.

They were already talking divorce and I can pretty much guarantee the mom stayed because if she had followed through with a divorce while he was sick she would of been shunned and disowned.

Her dating \"only 4 months after\" probably seems wierd to the family but not her because she already moved on before he died. \n\nYTA op. There's a good chance she might not of been happy for a long time but stuck it out. She sounds like she's found some happiness but everyone wants to shit all over it because they can't move past your dad.

That isn't fair and it is tragic and I recognize that pain. A part of healing is accepting that your grief is your own, we can't be better if we expect everyone else to follow an unspoken guideline.

I get it, you maybe feel like you are betraying your dad by accepting your Mom moved on after he passed too quickly.

Doesn\u2019t mean they had to be together forever though. \nI think you and your family only find her new partner joining events \u201cawkward\u201d because you all think that she should be grieving your dad\u2019s death and not move on yet, that\u2019s selfish of you- not her.\nShe probably moved on well before his death. I think you should try to put your emotions aside and be happy for your mom.", "Question, do you not understand that their marriage was over with before he died and so she had essentially already moved on from him but only stayed to honor the vows when they got married? You're mad because your mom wants happiness? It would be a different story if they weren't considering divorce and had a happy marriage. But they didn't. She only stayed to take care of him so he wouldn't be alone through it. YTA. Y'all treating her so horribly because she moved on from dad long before he died", "YTA. You\u2019re a grown ass adult and your mother is free to live her own life, especially after she stuck around to take care of your dad even though they were in the midst of a divorce before he got sick. It\u2019s not your say when she dates again", "Hmmmm YTA. It\u2019s not for you to decide if your mom is dating too soon. She\u2019s and adult and you\u2019re and adult so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s becoming your dad or becoming your parental figure or moving into your home.\n\nYour relationship with your parents is completely different than the one they had to each other and frankly you probably had no idea what that was like. And it sounded like it was on the rocks. Yet your mom stayed and took care of him til the end\u2026which is more than what most men do with their terminally sick wives statistically. Also, it\u2019s a 20 person vacation. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna be stuck in a room with him. You\u2019re acting immature about it.", "YTA you're acting childish and selfish", "YTA\nMy goodness some people just suck. That\u2019s you OP. I am VERY vocal with my family, that should anything happen to me, I love my husband so much that I want him to find happiness again because I\u2019ll be dead and clearly won\u2019t give a damn.. if e were close to divorce, I would wish that for him even more. What is wrong with you that you want to control someone else\u2019s life this much? Focus on you, I\u2019m assuming everything in your own life isn\u2019t great because happy people don\u2019t try to ruin other people\u2019s lives. Get a therapist.", "I think the hang up is your issue, not hers. YTA. They had a bad marriage, but she \u201csucked it up\u201d and was there for you dad through the end. And you somehow are faulting her for finding a new boyfriend? Suppose she had gotten divorced when she wanted to, ignored you dad and moved on then? Give the guy a chance. I am sorry you lost your father, but it is not this man\u2019s fault.", "YTA why can\u2019t you just be happy for your mum?", "NTA for cancelling. Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to and ruin the trip for everyone else with your attitude. You need to do some serious work on yourself and stop shitting on the happiness your mom has found. Go see a therapist.", "NTA. I think you need to accept that your mother's boyfriend might stay in her life and understand that pushing him away may push her away in the same go.\n\nTo you, your father was, well, your father for your entire life and there is no finding a new father - But to your mother, he was only part of half her life, and there was enough problems in their marriage for her to still consider divorce despite that.\n\nBUT, you mention that you're not the only one that doesn't want this man to come along on this vacation, and their feelings should be considered too if that is true - If majority doesn't want him there, then the majority should be respected.\n\nMaybe talk to the other relatives and have a frank conversation about it with your mother?", "YTA. My granny passed away in November \u201822. I found out my grandad had a girlfriend on Valentine\u2019s Day. It hurt, but i put my pride aside because he deserves to be happy and find love. Your mom should be able to do the same.", "Why can\u2019t your mom be happy? She didn\u2019t leave your dying dad, must she act a nun and be isolated for your comfort? Do what you want about this vacation but you\u2019re a horrible daughter to keep your mom from happiness. YTA", "My parents had a similar story. They were heading towards divorce after 30 years together and my mom was diagnosed with stage 3B breast cancer. She fought for 3 years, but it went to her brain and she passed 6 months later. \n\nMy dad started dating just months after. He met his now-wife the first Christmas without my mom and they\u2019ve been married to for nearly 20 years now. \n\nI see a lot of \u201cI\u2019m not ready\u201d and \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon\u201d but absolutely nothing about how you\u2019re supporting your mom during this transition from your dad\u2019s wife to a widow looking for someone who can add happiness to her life. Just as she doesn\u2019t get to \u201capprove\u201d your dating life, you don\u2019t get to \u201capprove\u201d hers. Welcome him and maybe you\u2019ll see what she sees in him. Either way, being on the outside only ensures you\u2019re not part of her life going forward. \n\nYTA.", "I have some questions:\n\n1) Are you unwilling to allow her to date, be happy? I ask this because I've seen children who absolutely rejected their widowed parent to move forward to the point they made their parent miserable simply bc they didn't want their deceased parent replaced. Hint: widows and widowers don't stop loving their deceased spouses (I'm a widower). I have told widows and widowers to do what makes them happy bc it's their life they're living, everybody else be damned.\n\n2) Has her suitor made uncomfortable remarks or does he think and act different from your dad, a personality you recognize? \n\n3) Do you think it's too soon for mom to be with somebody?  Talk to most widows and widowers and they'll tell you it's lonely as fuck after being with someone for a certain amount of time. You miss the intimacy that you got so used to; I'm not talking sex but more like holding hands, having your arm atop your partner in the bed, hugs...stupid, simple hugs. I digress. I've met widowers who dated months post loss. They grieve for their wives still. And I've met widowers who grieve their wives years afterward, opting to be alone for the rest of their days.\n\nMy last question: can you be your mom's happiness 24/7? That's a trick question bc the answer is a resounding no. You can't live her life for her, you can't replace your happiness fir hers. Let her be happy.\n\nReading your story and listening to widows and widowers complaining about their children, YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE. That comes from a fellow asshole, we recognize our own kind.", "For what it\u2019s worth, my parents divorced after 30 years of marriage and what I\u2019m scared of is my mom always being alone and not dating again. YTA", "YTA, completely. This woman gave your father decades of her life, and put on a show to ensure that the family didn\u2019t suffer overly much while he was ill. Despite the fact that she was unhappy and already planning to leave. That is a sacrifice that you should be grateful for, and yet instead you are trying to make her life after your father has passed about YOU and everyone else except her. This is her time. Support her and show her the love and gratitude she deserves.", "YTA. Your mom and dad\u2019s marriage was done along time ago, well before his diagnosis. You say they came together? No. Your mom stayed and took care of him, out of the love she had for him over the years and duty. She had every right to leave, but put her life on hold yo make his final 18 months better. She sacrificed her happiness and you want her to continue based on your arbitrary timeline? You and other family members are making it weird. You are ignoring that she grieved differently and during his life. Apologize to your mom. Seek grief counseling", "YTA Your mom and dad were checking out of the relationship before he got ill. Think about that. They were going to divorce and your mom (the soon to be ex) STAYED and cared for him. She grieved the relationship prior to his illness when they planned to divorce. And she grieved the loss of him when she found out he was terminal. \nI can\u2019t stress enough that her new relationship is none of your business. It isn\u2019t too soon. Had they divorced when they planned, this would already be years later. They \u2018broke up\u2019 almost 3 years ago, she stayed and cared for him, and now it\u2019s been a year. \nStop trying to drive a wedge between her and happiness.", "We are going through similar with someone in my family right now and to say tensions are there is an understatement. My mom and her sisters are concerned for my cousins and so am I because their mental and emotional health is at risk right now especially for one who is basically being pushed out of the house now. They lost a parent and the other moved on a little too fast and tried to bring their SO around a little too much. \n\nYou are right to say there need to be sensible boundaries this is very important family time is family time not family with a friend thrown in time.\n\nMy cousins refused to go on a trip because the SO would be there and I didn\u2019t argue with that. Problem here is the SO is actually a nice person so far my family member is the one being a jerk.", "I'm with you. Of course mom can move on, but the fact that she's not checking in on her family's feelings _at all_ , and then ignoring the concerns when they're brought to her directly, is insensitive. She's happy, she's done grieving, but she's hurting other people who are still grieving.\n\nSneaking him in for Easter felt purposeful, since I think she suspected people wouldn't be cool with it if she'd asked. So she just steamrolled them. I think she's banking on \"asking for forgiveness instead of permission\" but that's not a kind way to treat family", "This 120%", "Op isn't an AH for not wanting to vacation with this guy, but *is* an AH for not doing it anyway. \n\nSuck it up, so your mother \u2014 who carried you for months, who cared for you for 20 years. \u2014 does not have to die alone.", "I scrolled for way too long before seeing this, the sorry for OP's loss. Good grief, where is the compassion?!! Even a year is not a long time in the grieving process.", "OP is 34, not a teenager", "OP complained that her mother's boyfriend went to her mother's house for a holiday dinner.\n\nOP is acting like a 9 year old screaming, \"You're not my real dad\" over the very presence of the man in her mother's life.\n\nOP is definitely YTA here.", "They\u2019re renting this place for TWENTY people. This place is probably going to be large enough and crowded enough that OP won\u2019t feel his presence like they think they will. I also feel that OP is heavily projecting their feelings onto everyone around them, based on the way this post was written. I can\u2019t imagine that out of the entire family, no one has even hinted towards OP\u2019s mom (besides OP themself) that they don\u2019t want the boyfriend coming along if they indeed did not want him going.\n\nLastly, it sounds like the trip was planned and the boyfriend was tacked on later considering OP mentions cost changes due to flights.", "I was thinking she was about 19 or 20 at first. Whoa boy. 34.", "OP refuses to admit the marriage had been over for a while", "I typically agree that communication is super important, but after all mom has been through and then 7+ months of being criticized for moving on\u2026 it makes it a bit harder for me to blame her for not being completely forthcoming with her daughter. The trip is still a couple of months away\u2014not tomorrow. And mom and boyfriend are staying at separate place, so it\u2019s not like anyone is stuck with them.", "My dad died just last April of cancer, he was 90. We had hospice bring in a hospital bed in the living room. The last few days of his life he also wanted to get up and use the bathroom but he was just too weak. My sister and I took turns staying with him 24 hours and taking care of him. You need to get a urinal and have him sit on the edge of the bed, and help him use it. I never thought I'd be holding my dad's penis and helping him, but if he changed my diapers then I can sure help him while he's dyeing. I can only hope my kids will let me die in my own home, surrounded by family.", "I feel you buddy. It's hard, so hard. Fuck cancer. Shout out to all of us who cared/care for a parent with cancer, who showed love in the depths of despair and stayed strong despite breaking inside.", "In case you need to hear it today, thank you. \n\nYour dad is lucky to have such a wonderful child. Superman isn\u2019t going to die. He transferred the title to his son and now you are carrying on the tradition. \n\nI am sure your son sees you as Superman considering what you do. \n\nMay your father rest well when his time comes. I am sure he knows you love him and he loves and appreciates all you do and who you are.", "Would it help be possible to see if he could get a catheter put in? It's a little awkward and embarrassing at first, but when I was sick, it ended up being a God send. My mom no longer had to help me to the bathroom, and i no longer had to wake both of us up 15x a night or more to go pee. Or, they have portable toilets that you can put next to the bed. We used that for a while until it was too hard for me to do even that on my own.\n\nI'm so sorry if I'm overstepping. I'm sure you have people up to you eyeballs trying to give you advice. I just wanted to suggest it since it helped my mom and I so much. I am so sorry for what you and your father are going through.", "With a pinecone .", "We got him one yesterday but they didn\u2019t include the splash guard!  That arrived today.  Last night I was guiding him to the bathroom and my dad was moving fast (for him) and he started to slip on the floor.  I caught him but it scared the hell out of me. Now the toilet chair sits near his bed.", "I was thinking of a cactus piece but that works too.", "We got the toilet chair yesterday but they didn\u2019t include the splash guard. That came today as well as the bottle.  LPT line the bucket with plastic grocery bags!"]}
