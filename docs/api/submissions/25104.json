Now, they're doing the same with Chloe's daughter Ava.\n\nAva has a room in my parents' home. They got her a horse to ride when she's a bit older, and they just adore her to the moon and back. Same can't be said about any of us. So while we were having dinner dad asked about Chloe's job. She's a lawyer like him so they had this lengthy conversation about how amazing Chloe was at work and how dad hoped Chloe woild take over his role at the firm one day.\n\nAfter the conversation I asked dad if he would like to know about Max's and my career too. He said sure. The conversation lasted 10 seconds for each of us. So I told Chloe as she could see by the conversation, she was always the favourite child. She denied it of couse. But I said it has always been this way.\n\nChloe asked me to elaborate. I told her all the things I said here. The part where I may be TA is that our traditional parents even came to terms with her being gay while if Max or I was gay it would never be accepted this way. This escalated to an argument which ended with Chloe and Bella leaving with Ava and our parwnts being pissed at Max and I.\n\nMy parents think I'm a monster. I however think it needed to be said.

If so then ESH.\n\nThe problem with the golden child dynamic is that it pits the siblings against each other when it\u2019s the parents at fault. This was a fight you should\u2019ve had with your parents, not your sister", "I really don\u2019t understand why you had to call out your sister instead of your parents?\n\nAlso, your niece is 5.  Why are you jealous of a 5 year old.\n\nSo far, Chloe and her family seem innocent in the whole thing. \n\nSo, YTA, if you have an issue with your parents treatment of you, tell your parents.", "YTA - I hate passing this judgement dude, but I say asshole because of time, place, and context. You came across as someone who wasn\u2019t getting the attention they wanted and decided to drag your sister to prove a point. I feel for you, I actually do, but there was no argument to warrant this. No one was up in arms. This could\u2019ve been a private conversation between siblings or in therapy to address this issue but you wanted a public soapbox. Using her sexuality as a talking point was a low blow, especially in this setting. \n\nPlease invite your sister to lunch, apologize, and explain yourself. Then talk this out with a professional, there\u2019s clearly a lot here you want to say and need to deal with.", "esh. I don't think what you said was wrong. But I do think you picked a really weird time to say it tbh. I think with all the children present it wasn't a good time to hash this out. I understand tho sitting on these feelings for a long time tends to lead to these things happening. I wouldn't beat yourself up or worry about apologizing, I would just pick the timing of your battles more tactfully in the future. \n\nTo reiterate tho esh, because you wouldn't have picked such a weird time if the issue hadn't gone unacknowledged on their end for so long. They suck far more than you don't lose sleep.", "ESH. I understand where you're coming from with how your parents treat you and your brother in comparison to Chloe, but this dinner wasn't the time or the place to bring this up. It doesn't seem like anything unusual happened, and you got into this fight in front of kids who are innocent in all this.", "ESH except Chloe and all the kids. \n\nPresuming this is being faithfully presented, your parents are AH for blatant favoritism, and especially for continuing that favoritism in their grandparenting. It sounds like you really need to get this off your chest and have a conversation with the family about this, however I think the way you handled it makes you an AH as well. Throwing a gotcha question and then seemingly focusing it on Chloe and not your parents specifically. Your parents are the ones in the wrong here, it's not Chloe's fault she was the golden child. And yes you are TA re: her sexuality and your parents acceptance because you both: will never know how true what you said is or, presumably, if there weren't some really hard times between your parents and Chloe that you weren't privy to.", "Info: what do you and Max do for work? It sucks to feel like your parents prefer another sibling to you, but it might be a situation where they just have more uncommon with your sister and the relationship is easier. Also, your sister is the oldest and produced the first grandchild so there are a few things that impact the type of relationship shes cultivated in addition to sharing more interests with your dad. Maybe you need to work on finding ways to bond individually with your parents. Your parents obviously need to make an effort to invest in your and Max's lives as well, but it seems like you've been mad at your sister and resentful of your parents a long time. Thats something you need to work out if you want to have a good relationship. Telling her she's a golden child and bringing her sexuality into this was too much and not helpful for anything. You need to take up your concerns with your parents not her. YTA for your behavior and cruelty to her.", "Some here will say he's the jerk for picking this fight at this particular moment.\n\nI guess my response is, well... this was the moment where it came out. \n\nOP tried to bring the conversation around to be more inclusive (good Lord, to have to all but insist your folks ask you about your career?), and it fell flat. He brought up the issue of being a golden child, everyone got defensive, and there it went. If this has been building for decades, probably best to address this directly, face-to-face. \n\nGood luck, OP. It will take a lot to bring parents like this around to seeing your perspective, let alone to try and rectify it. NTA", "ESH there are kids there, it\u2019s not the time.  The other part at this point is perpetuating it by spending time there and listening to all of it.  The other part is to remember that the golden child doesn\u2019t make that choice themselves. If you have a problem with it then confront your parents about it alone.  I\u2019m also guessing a lot of it has to do with her being the oldest and female.", "You blame chloe for your parents behaviour", "Yta", "YTA, sounds insecure and jealous. Nobody wanted to talk about your jobs and you forced them into the conversation just so you could prove a point.", "Definitely NTA. No matter what you and your brother say, your parents would never care. So I suggest go low contact with your sister and no contact with your parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Op's sister must be blind to not see and acknowledge it", "Is it favoritism yet? OP has 2 year Olds vs the other grandchild is 5. They are at different development levels and have different needs/abilities. Also the 5 year old is the first grandchild so there's an element of newness that impacted her treatment, which needs to be navigated now there are additional grandkids. I think what OP may be missing is that you have different relationships with each child and grandchild and figuring out how to be fair but not exactly the same is important and takes work. Having a calm discussion with OPs parents is the answer, not blaming sister and niece for having a \"better\" experience.", "ESH. I think you were fine and obviously had plenty of evidence (e.g. Ava\u2019s horse) without bringing in your sister\u2019s sexual orientation. Like, you would prefer your parents were homophobes?", "Your parents are upset cause you\u2019re right about them.\n\nChloe and her family are not the issue. What do you expect? Chloe to parent your parents into better parents?? She\u2019s also just on of the kids.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for saying it, I think it\u2019s AH to attack Chloe and if you said this in front of the kids.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand how grandparents can have one bedroom for a specific grandchild and not all. Realistically i would have gotten my own room with my grandma but she didn\u2019t let the others know I was her favourite. That seems really cruel of them. Your issue should be directed to your parents and if they aren\u2019t treating your kid right maybe you and max should step back. \n\nAlso your sister should be helping in calling out the parents for favouring only their kid.", "YTA for using the term \u201cgolden child,\u201d causing an argument in front of children over your jealousy, and taking your resentment out on your sister when you clearly have issues with your parents.", "NTA sometimes after awhile the littlest things set u off .", "All these y t a comments are so weird to me, I mean yea the time and place was off an you 100%, need to confront your parents not just Chloe but I get it, this little seemingly inconsequential moment was the final straw. \n\nYou tried to redirect some of their attention to your and Max and when that didn't happen you snapped. Yes your parents need to confronted and you just let them off, but I agree that Chloe also needed to be confronted. she's reaped all the benefits of being the favorite. and is either blind to it or doesn't care, but a reality check to see how it's been affecting her sibling is warranted especially considering she might be the only person your parents listen to.\n\nI am confused about why you even bother, your parents aren't interested in your lives so stop making an effort. Pull back, they've ignored you so don't reach out, force them to carry the brunt of continuing the relationship and if they don't you have your answer, they aren't interested...\n\nMore importantly your kids are only 2 now, but eventually they will be old enough to realize that their cousin is the favorite and they've been treated differently. Why put them through that, spare them from growing up to be adults so starved for their grandparents attention that cause a scene at a family dinner.\n\nJust go LC and get some therapy. NTA", "NAH they all needed to hear it. You can't play favourites with your children.", "ESH\n\n  While nothing you said was false, from what you say.\n\n\n You just choose an odd time to voice it.", "NTA. You should have called out your parents and you should blame them. And if they don\u2019t care about you and your family then go low or no contact.\nBut you don\u2019t need to apologize to your sister. Because she knows that she is the favorite. It\u2019s bullshit for denying she didn\u2019t know. And anybody on this table knew except for the kids.", "ESH because favouritism is harmful. But the timing was wrong, and the details you chose to pick on came across as petty - of course a lawyer has more to talk about with another lawyer as opposed to someone in a different profession, and your highlighting of your sister's sexuality came across as dismissive of her instead of your parents. This means that valid concerns such as the bedroom thing or feeling neglected went undercut.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Golden child doesn't just mean favourite. It's usually referred to as one type of abusive situation in it's own right, even if it can be used for general favouritism, (but only when that favouritism is harmful to the favourite child too- eg. high standards causing stress/fear)", "YTA to bring this up in front of kids. eva did not choose to come into this situation. You should have found a better time and space to air your grievances.", "You and Max should go LC with your parents and sister.", "ESH (except for the kids and Chloe). Your parents are obviously in the wrong for having favoritism, but it seems like Chloe genuinely doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s treated differently, so you taking it out on her instead of on your parents is shitty. And bringing the argument of \u201cI bet my parents wouldn\u2019t accept it if I was gay!\u201d is just kind of ridiculous because you have no way of knowing for sure.", "NTA. You clearly needed to say it and now that you have you need to accept it and move on.", "The grandparents only have one room dedicated to the 5 year old and her parents were cool with that happening. I\u2019m not saying the sister deserved all the smoke but I don\u2019t see how an adult ignores that. I would be upset for my children having grandparents that aren\u2019t showing the love to all their grandkids.", "My thing is that their parents are the ones who favorited her at the detriment to him and Max, why not call out *his parents* for *their* behavior instead (and leave her sexual orientation out of it)? Like OP has my sympathy but he didn\u2019t navigate this well.", "But also, what behavior? OP mentions ONE instance of the career/job conversation and that short conversation doesn't necessarily mean that the sister is the golden child.\nINFO: \nOP, it also sounds like you wanted your parents to \"reject\" your sister because of her being gay? Or if Ava has a room, why is that bad? Do they not love your kids? Could you give more examples of blatant favoritism?", "Nah.  People are adults.  You can choose when things come out.  Or you then take responsibility for them.", "That\u2019s why OP is AH.  Bring it up to the people who show favoritism.  It\u2019s not his sister\u2019s fault", "Eh, I could see it as reasonable that they have a room for the five-year-old but not the 2-year-olds (yet?). Like, I could see a five-year-old having sleepovers at their grandparents' house but not necessarily a two-year-old if the grandparents weren't comfortable with diapering/toddler tantrums. Like, it's just a different level of care. I'd be interested in knowing how old Ava was when she got the room. \n\nI'm not saying that the OP is wrong or that Chloe isn't the golden child. She very well could be! But the room, in and of itself, is not a smoking gun.", "If someone is benefiting from the favortism and doesn\u2019t help call it out, I personally think they are part of the problem and share the blame. I don\u2019t see how the sister is okay with how the nieces or nephews are being treated like that.  \n\nThe defence of being ignorant to the favouritism doesn\u2019t sit right with me.  OP should have called everyone out but I don\u2019t think the sister isn\u2019t part of it."]}
