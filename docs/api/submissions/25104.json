That includes my older brother Max 26M his wife Megan 24F, and my sister Chloe 30F, her wife Bella 28F and their daughter 5F.\n\nChloe has always been my parents' favourite. They only cared about her achievements, her success and her ambitions in life because it clearly reflected their own interests. They always ignored Max and I. Now, they're doing the same with Chloe's daughter Ava.\n\nAva has a room in my parents' home. They got her a horse to ride when she's a bit older, and they just adore her to the moon and back. Same can't be said about any of us. So while we were having dinner dad asked about Chloe's job. She's a lawyer like him so they had this lengthy conversation about how amazing Chloe was at work and how dad hoped Chloe woild take over his role at the firm one day.\n\nAfter the conversation I asked dad if he would like to know about Max's and my career too. He said sure. The conversation lasted 10 seconds for each of us. So I told Chloe as she could see by the conversation, she was always the favourite child. She denied it of couse. But I said it has always been this way.\n\nChloe asked me to elaborate. I told her all the things I said here. The part where I may be TA is that our traditional parents even came to terms with her being gay while if Max or I was gay it would never be accepted this way. This escalated to an argument which ended with Chloe and Bella leaving with Ava and our parwnts being pissed at Max and I.\n\nMy parents think I'm a monster. I however think it needed to be said.

If so then ESH.\n\nThe problem with the golden child dynamic is that it pits the siblings against each other when it\u2019s the parents at fault. This was a fight you should\u2019ve had with your parents, not your sister", "I really don\u2019t understand why you had to call out your sister instead of your parents?\n\nAlso, your niece is 5.  Why are you jealous of a 5 year old.\n\nSo far, Chloe and her family seem innocent in the whole thing. \n\nSo, YTA, if you have an issue with your parents treatment of you, tell your parents.", "YTA - I hate passing this judgement dude, but I say asshole because of time, place, and context. You came across as someone who wasn\u2019t getting the attention they wanted and decided to drag your sister to prove a point. I feel for you, I actually do, but there was no argument to warrant this. No one was up in arms. This could\u2019ve been a private conversation between siblings or in therapy to address this issue but you wanted a public soapbox. Using her sexuality as a talking point was a low blow, especially in this setting. \n\nPlease invite your sister to lunch, apologize, and explain yourself. Then talk this out with a professional, there\u2019s clearly a lot here you want to say and need to deal with.", "esh. I don't think what you said was wrong. But I do think you picked a really weird time to say it tbh. I think with all the children present it wasn't a good time to hash this out. I understand tho sitting on these feelings for a long time tends to lead to these things happening. I wouldn't beat yourself up or worry about apologizing, I would just pick the timing of your battles more tactfully in the future. \n\nTo reiterate tho esh, because you wouldn't have picked such a weird time if the issue hadn't gone unacknowledged on their end for so long. They suck far more than you don't lose sleep.", "ESH. I understand where you're coming from with how your parents treat you and your brother in comparison to Chloe, but this dinner wasn't the time or the place to bring this up. It doesn't seem like anything unusual happened, and you got into this fight in front of kids who are innocent in all this.", "ESH except Chloe and all the kids. \n\nPresuming this is being faithfully presented, your parents are AH for blatant favoritism, and especially for continuing that favoritism in their grandparenting. It sounds like you really need to get this off your chest and have a conversation with the family about this, however I think the way you handled it makes you an AH as well. Throwing a gotcha question and then seemingly focusing it on Chloe and not your parents specifically. Your parents are the ones in the wrong here, it's not Chloe's fault she was the golden child. And yes you are TA re: her sexuality and your parents acceptance because you both: will never know how true what you said is or, presumably, if there weren't some really hard times between your parents and Chloe that you weren't privy to.", "Info: what do you and Max do for work? It sucks to feel like your parents prefer another sibling to you, but it might be a situation where they just have more uncommon with your sister and the relationship is easier. Also, your sister is the oldest and produced the first grandchild so there are a few things that impact the type of relationship shes cultivated in addition to sharing more interests with your dad. Maybe you need to work on finding ways to bond individually with your parents. Your parents obviously need to make an effort to invest in your and Max's lives as well, but it seems like you've been mad at your sister and resentful of your parents a long time. Thats something you need to work out if you want to have a good relationship. Telling her she's a golden child and bringing her sexuality into this was too much and not helpful for anything. You need to take up your concerns with your parents not her. YTA for your behavior and cruelty to her.", "Some here will say he's the jerk for picking this fight at this particular moment.\n\nI guess my response is, well... this was the moment where it came out. \n\nOP tried to bring the conversation around to be more inclusive (good Lord, to have to all but insist your folks ask you about your career?), and it fell flat. He brought up the issue of being a golden child, everyone got defensive, and there it went. If this has been building for decades, probably best to address this directly, face-to-face. \n\nGood luck, OP. It will take a lot to bring parents like this around to seeing your perspective, let alone to try and rectify it. NTA", "ESH there are kids there, it\u2019s not the time.  The other part at this point is perpetuating it by spending time there and listening to all of it.  The other part is to remember that the golden child doesn\u2019t make that choice themselves. If you have a problem with it then confront your parents about it alone.  I\u2019m also guessing a lot of it has to do with her being the oldest and female.", "You blame chloe for your parents behaviour", "Yta", "YTA, sounds insecure and jealous. Nobody wanted to talk about your jobs and you forced them into the conversation just so you could prove a point.", "Definitely NTA. No matter what you and your brother say, your parents would never care. So I suggest go low contact with your sister and no contact with your parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Op's sister must be blind to not see and acknowledge it", "Is it favoritism yet? OP has 2 year Olds vs the other grandchild is 5. They are at different development levels and have different needs/abilities. Also the 5 year old is the first grandchild so there's an element of newness that impacted her treatment, which needs to be navigated now there are additional grandkids. I think what OP may be missing is that you have different relationships with each child and grandchild and figuring out how to be fair but not exactly the same is important and takes work. Having a calm discussion with OPs parents is the answer, not blaming sister and niece for having a \"better\" experience."]}
