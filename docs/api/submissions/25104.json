It sucks to feel like your parents prefer another sibling to you, but it might be a situation where they just have more in common with your sister and the relationship is easier. Also, your sister is the oldest and produced the first grandchild so there are a few things that impact the type of relationship shes cultivated in addition to sharing more interests with your dad. Maybe you need to work on finding ways to bond individually with your parents. Your parents obviously need to make an effort to invest in your and Max's lives as well, but it seems like you've been mad at your sister and resentful of your parents a long time. Thats something you need to work out if you want to have a good relationship. Telling her she's a golden child and bringing her sexuality into this was too much and not helpful for anything.

He brought up the issue of being a golden child, everyone got defensive, and there it went.

The other part at this point is perpetuating it by spending time there and listening to all of it.  The other part is to remember that the golden child doesn\u2019t make that choice themselves.

Yes your parents need to confronted and you just let them off, but I agree that Chloe also needed to be confronted. she's reaped all the benefits of being the favorite. and is either blind to it or doesn't care, but a reality check to see how it's been affecting her sibling is warranted especially considering she might be the only person your parents listen to.\n\nI am confused about why you even bother, your parents aren't interested in your lives so stop making an effort. Pull back, they've ignored you so don't reach out, force them to carry the brunt of continuing the relationship and if they don't you have your answer, they aren't interested...\n\nMore importantly your kids are only 2 now, but eventually they will be old enough to realize that their cousin is the favorite and they've been treated differently.

This means that valid concerns such as the bedroom thing or feeling neglected went undercut.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Golden child doesn't just mean favourite.

I\u2019m a teacher - when I get together with other teachers, we end up talking about our jobs. People like to bond over things that they can relate on. Should your parents show equal interest, yes, but this is a thing. Blaming your sister for your parents behavior isn\u2019t going to help.

You're not in a good position in your families dynamic as it seems i can only guess. Fireing that low blow at a family dinner is a dig thing to do. There is room for this in an controlled enviourment. You have two lawyers in your family the might listen to you if you present them facts and elaborate while you feel how you do in a mannered way.

This wasn't the time or place and did you seriously do this in front of your 5 year old niece ?", " I don't think it's favoritism really. People tend to gravitate to what they know and are comforatable with. Your dad is a lawyer and knows and understands what is being told to him and what questions to ask your sister so of course that conversation was much longer than you only talking for 10seconds about your career. Also if you only had 10seconds worth of conversation why did you bring it up? As for the room, do your children want to be staying often enough that they need a room? Did your niece have a room already because for like 3 years she was the only grandchild? Since she's 5 and your kids are only 2, it makes sense your kids may not have a room if there's not extra room. Like do you want your nieces room takent away now that you have kids? If she already had it then what would the solution be? YTA and there is no way to know if your parents would have accepted you being gay because you aren't? Don't invalidate other peoples experiences because your jealous and immature. Maybe talk with your parents about spending more time with your kids if you're worried they won't have a strong grandchild grandparent relationship? Other than that this is all ridiculous.", "YTA.

Have you ever brought this topic up before or did you finally just blurt it out. You deserve your chance to have this conversation but sometimes you need to have the right time and place.

Stick to the facts and argue with those.\n\nYour parents are the biggest AH. Yes Chloe is a product of it, but so are you with your years of resentment. Neither of you two got to choose your family or how you were treated. Chloe got the better deal but your biggest battle is with your parents for setting up the dynamic and continuing on to the grandchildren with the same practice. Fight them with facts and ask questions in regards to things such as equal gifts or interest.

Many of their parents waited until the kids were growing out of toddler years to introduce horses. \n\nI could see five being an okay age to start, but two being too young for safety reasons. Maybe the grandparents intend to get horses when the twins are older if they express interest?", "It's bad because it's in context with OP's freaking life which he talks about in the post when he says \"They only cared about her achievements, her success and her ambitions in life because it clearly reflected their own interests. They always ignored Max and I.\" \n\nI think OP sees that his kids are going to be ignored the same way he and his brother were growing up. That hurts.

The fact is that as presented, they just don't care.", "Yeah but what about the standard questions? OP had to prompt that conversation, apparently. \n\nSimple stuff like, how's your job? Is it doing well? What do you usually do? Any interesting clients or cases? Broad stroke question that people can answer with as little detail as possible... That didn't happen.", "The twins are three years younger, and presumably would stay in that same room if they had sleepovers with the grandparents. \n\nLike, idk if my sister will reproduce, but my kid is currently my parents' only grandchild. Their smaller spare room is referred to as \"[my kid's name]'s room\", and has been since he was born.\n\nOne of the four year olds in my kid's scout troop is already riding around on a horse with her gran, so I'm not sure it's a \"when she's older\" thing.", "And perhaps it will be, once the twins are old enough for frequent sleepovers. \n\nAll of OP's examples are situations where the grandparents never had a chance to treat OP the same. It's absurd to be upset that they didn't buy horses for twin two year olds.  It's actually insane to be upset that they accepted the sister's sexuality.", "\u201cHow\u2019s the job going?\u201d It\u2019s going good\u201d there\u2019s the ten second conversation that OP mentioned", "Again, all those questions are pretty job specific though. If you don\u2019t understand the job, then most those questions are pointless. \u201cWhat do you usually do\u201d seems like it would be an insensitive question if the parents supposedly already know what they do. How do you know their job involves clients or cases? The rest of those questions require a base understanding of the job components to hold a conversation about. And some jobs have extra factors, a previous job I held we didn\u2019t talk about at the dinner table because it would leave everyone with no appetite (medical). Sometimes these lack of conversations aren\u2019t about lack of interest in their lives, but lack of understanding. Notice how OP doesn\u2019t mention mom talking about work with the daughter- probably because mom doesn\u2019t know how to talk about her daughter\u2019s/husband\u2019s work.", "Op wrote it for when she is older hence the assumption, also if your sister had kids I hope they would call it the kids room and make it for all of them.  \nAges 2-3 the kids are going to start to notice if their cousin had stuff at their grandparents but not them. Questions are going to start being asked in the next few years.", "After OP had to specifically ask for his father to even ask that question. Again, it's about taking an interest and if the father had his way they wouldn't have even had that little a conversation about it."]}
