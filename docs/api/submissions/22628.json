My oldest brother, 37, has decided to propose to his girlfriend and straight away they decided they were going to go on a cruise to get married. They usually do cruises so this wasn't abnormal for them. They invited my parents, other siblings and myself, along with her family. Each person was to pay their own way. \n\nAfter long discussions, I explained to my parents that I had 2 reasons that I couldnt/didn't want to go. Reason 1, I live alone and don't have that kind of money. I don't have a partner, so everything I pay for is out of my own wage. The total for myself to go would be close to $3000, and I was told there would be no help from family to pay for it. \n\nReason 2, my brother's girlfriend and family had made death threats towards me a year ago and I haven't spoken to them since. A year ago my brother's girlfriend accused me of talking bad about her, so she went to Facebook and wrote a status which her \"friends\" and family commented with death threats toward me. I've never gotten an apology, even after the truth that I hadn't done what I was being accused of came out. All I got from my brother was, \"she will never apologise, even when she hurts me she will never admit she is wrong, just move on\". \n\nMy parents are on my side of this and they don't like her family, so now they have decided they aren't going to the wedding/cruise either. My sister has started planning to go and has accused me and my parents of being rude and disloyal towards my brother for saying we aren't going. My sister won't listen when I explain I would be uncomfortable if her family were to start anything like they did a year ago with me and I wouldn't want to ruin their time or waste my money if I got upset and spent all my time in the room on the boat. \n\nI've only told my brother that I can't afford the cruise so that's why I won't be going, I've left out the issues I have with his girlfriend's family as to not upset him. The cruise is a year away, so I am still debating on whether I can swing the money to go, but without my parents there I feel like I would be ganged up on if anything were to be said or happen. I'm also a bit upset because the date they have chosen is my birthday, my 30th birthday, and yes a cruise would be nice to celebrate but as my family have stated, \"nothing would be about me, it's only a birthday, nothing would be celebrated for me\".", "created_utc": 1689757431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153pmhs/aita_for_not_going_to_my_brothers_weddingcruise/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because your brother is willing to accept his fianc\u00e9es behaviour, doesn't mean you have to.\n\nThat your parents are on your side underline that you are not exaggerating the problems with the fianc\u00e9e and family.\n\nAnyone who organises an expensive destination wedding needs to accept that people may not go. No one is obligated too spend that kind of money (not to mention PTO/ leave from work) for someone else's wedding choices.", "oh my fucking god. not the asshole. already off the bat its a no because if youre telling guests to pay their own way you have to expect people to say \"okay then im not going\". and then there were death threats and the fact that theyre planning it for your birthday??? especially your 30th!!!! just no. id personally have already cut contact with her and maybe even brother as well, but obviously were different people. you need to tell them \"fuck no\" and have the best 30th birthday. hell, start celebrating now. your soon to be sister in law's family sounds nuts though so good for you for not speaking to them", "NTA. Don't go and celebrate your birthday with your parents and your friends!", "NTA, Reason 2 is an automatic no", "definitely do not go why would you go to. pay for something that 1. is outside your means 2. to be forced to spend time with people (brothers future wife (and maybe her family too?)) who were hurtful towards you?\n\nbe firm on your decision. and your brother shouldn't need to be reminded of his future wife's behaviour towards you.", "NTA\n\nUse your own money to make your own trip to where you like to go on your birthday. Even at home with a glas of wine on your porch will be more comfy as going on the cruise.\n\nDont discuss this with your brother or sister. Its your money and your time on your birthday.\n\nIs your SIL is angry about then she will be fare away enough that you dont hear it. Switch of your devices and you have your freedom.", "NTA\n\nReason 2 should be Reason 1 because it\u2019s all you need. I wouldn\u2019t care if you were a billionaire who could buy the entire cruise line.\n\nDo NOT attend this wedding, regardless of where it\u2019s held, regardless of when it\u2019s held.", "nta\n\nlisten death threats need to be taken seriously and they posted them on a public platform\n\nyou were well within your rights to go to the police but you didnt \n\ndont interact with them and if people ask why if you can get screen shots and just send them with no other information", "NTA I can\u2019t understand why you would even consider going. Why would you spend time with the family of lunatics that made death threats to you?! If you do manage to save the money spend it on something fun that actually celebrates your birthday and do it with people who have not threatened to kill you.", "NTA. Destination weddings are in themselves an offensive act, and a destination cruise is worse. I'd refuse on principal, and that's before your bombshell about death threats. If you can find the money for a vacation, spend it on something *you* choose for yourself. Not paying for someone else's wedding.\n\nBecause there's a dirty secret about destination weddings: often, the bridal couple get a discount or even get their suite comped outright for bringing enough ~~suckers~~ other guests in the wedding party, all of whom are expected to pay their own way, and at full rate. In effect, the guests at a destination wedding pay for the honeymoon without knowing it.", "NTA.

Nevermind the money, the death threats no way would I go, and your brother just thinks it was fine for her to do that and did nothing to put a stop to it? They both sound like terrible people. Stay at home and have a great time with your friends celebrating your birthday.", "NTA\n\nDo not get on a boat with people who have threatened you. There is no way to escape them if they act on those threats.
