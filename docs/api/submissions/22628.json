My oldest brother, 37, has decided to propose to his girlfriend and straight away they decided they were going to go on a cruise to get married. They usually do cruises so this wasn't abnormal for them. They invited my parents, other siblings and myself, along with her family. Each person was to pay their own way. \n\nAfter long discussions, I explained to my parents that I had 2 reasons that I couldnt/didn't want to go. Reason 1, I live alone and don't have that kind of money. I don't have a partner, so everything I pay for is out of my own wage. The total for myself to go would be close to $3000, and I was told there would be no help from family to pay for it. \n\nReason 2, my brother's girlfriend and family had made death threats towards me a year ago and I haven't spoken to them since. A year ago my brother's girlfriend accused me of talking bad about her, so she went to Facebook and wrote a status which her \"friends\" and family commented with death threats toward me. I've never gotten an apology, even after the truth that I hadn't done what I was being accused of came out. All I got from my brother was, \"she will never apologise, even when she hurts me she will never admit she is wrong, just move on\". \n\nMy parents are on my side of this and they don't like her family, so now they have decided they aren't going to the wedding/cruise either. My sister has started planning to go and has accused me and my parents of being rude and disloyal towards my brother for saying we aren't going. My sister won't listen when I explain I would be uncomfortable if her family were to start anything like they did a year ago with me and I wouldn't want to ruin their time or waste my money if I got upset and spent all my time in the room on the boat. \n\nI've only told my brother that I can't afford the cruise so that's why I won't be going, I've left out the issues I have with his girlfriend's family as to not upset him. The cruise is a year away, so I am still debating on whether I can swing the money to go, but without my parents there I feel like I would be ganged up on if anything were to be said or happen. I'm also a bit upset because the date they have chosen is my birthday, my 30th birthday, and yes a cruise would be nice to celebrate but as my family have stated, \"nothing would be about me, it's only a birthday, nothing would be celebrated for me\".", "created_utc": 1689757431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153pmhs/aita_for_not_going_to_my_brothers_weddingcruise/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd tell your brother that your door is always open for him and him only, but that you do not have this kind of money, that it was inconsiderate of them to choose your 30th birthday as you will naturally want to celebrate this big birthday with your own party with your own friends, and that you are not comfortable being on a boat with people who have slandered you and who have sent you death threats.

Not sure why he is sticking around for this but that's his problem.", "NTA-- Well that escalated quickly from reason 1 to 2... your sister sounds like an AH for not seeing that her family essentially committed a crime against you and your brother sounds like he's in an unhealthy relationship if \"she will never apologize, even when she hurts me she will never admit she is wrong, just move on\" is his go to response. I'm glad your parents are on your side... also the whole birthday thing (in my opinion) is another affront but maybe you should ask who chose the dates-- they may have been planning for you to not go.", "NTA.  And money would def not be the reason for me.  I would absolutely tell my brother the real reason I don't want to go.  You were bullied by her family.  Death threats nonetheless.  Why in the world would you even want to be around those fucked up ppl?  Don't go & please don't feel bad about it.  This family owes you an apology & I wouldn't budge til I got it.  Which apparently is never going to happen.", "NTA.   Cruises, like destination weddings, are something many people can't/won't attend.   If they are adamant that you \\*have\\* to be there then they can pay your way.   As for the rest of it, I've seen relationships like that where one person must always be 100% right and will never acknowledge any error on their part.   Your brother will be single again within 5 years I suspect.  You can go to his next wedding instead.", "NTA. But your brother and future sister-in-law and family certainly are. He's got all the red flags waving in his face, but he's still continuing on. Save your money and save yourself a huge headache.", "NTA\n\nYou have no requirement to attend the event of people who threatened your life. It is a good idea to stay far away from them.", "NTA - The death threats made me feel almost physically ill . .  PLEASE don't go. Just use the excuse of money issues and stay away from those people.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s out of your price range, and frankly the choice to have it on your 30th feels deliberate.", "NTA the cost alone is reason enough. The threats alone are reason enough. Put them together and you have MORE than enough reason to decline. \n\nIt's none of your sister's business. There's no disloyalty going on, although it's sad your brother didn't stick up for you. That doesn't bode well.\n\nAs for your birthday, save your money and go on your own trip with a friend or two.", "NTA, but boy, reason 2 should really be reason 1-1000, with no other reasons needed.", "NTA \n\nDo not set foot on that ship! Fiancee and her family sound like ignorant thugs.

Death threats? I hope you called the police because that's some serious sh!t.", "NTA and not just because I\u2019m terrified of cruises. How was her behavior not a deal breaker? Between the false accusations and the way her friends and family reacted, I would definitely walk away.", "NTA - huge NTA.  Why on earth would you want to go on a cruise with people who have sent you death threats?  Why would anyone expect you to.  You brother is definately an a-hole for dismissing and excusing her behaviour and the effect it has had on you.  Going to a normal wedding is one thing, but a cruise?  It isn\u00b4t as if you can just leave the venue and go home.  You are stuck with these nasty people for the duration of the trip.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHuge hugs to you.", "NTA\n\nStay home. The fact that your brother's GF planned this for your birthday makes me think she and her family are going to do something evil. I absolutely wouldn't want to be stuck on a boat, in the middle of the ocean, with no way out and surrounded by AHs. \n\nStay home and go out with your parents on that day. You can send the \"happy couple\" pictures of everyone toasting your birthday.", "Death threats are one thing you don't mess around with.\n\nAlways protect yourself.  Never go.  Red flags for your brother's wench.  The entire family is toxic.  If he was smart he would dump her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA however they are not the asshole for picking your birthday. There are only 365 days in the year.", "Death threats supercede all other considerations. Feel free to tell your brother you're afraid of his psychotic future family.", "NTA the cost us enough. that's the risk with a destination wedding, some people can't afford it so there it is. Wish your brother well and tell him you'll look forward to seeing when he returns as a married man.", "NTA but tell your brother the whole truth! He might feel it like a slap in the face and realise his fiances family are disgusting people", "NTA at all!\n\nIf I were in your position, I\u2019d stay home and enjoy my landmark bday. Besides, the temptation to push them off the ship might be too much\u2026", ">All I got from my brother was, \"she will never apologise, even when she hurts me she will never admit she is wrong, just move on\". \n\nI give them 3 years at most, no point in wasting $3k on a wedding of an already unhappy couple.

Cut them all off.", "Don't go ,celebrate your 30th birthday with your parents and make the most of it. You can't afford and they won't pay so ignore it. If you come and their family hurts you it will be very bad", "nta, i wouldn't go for either reason. heck, i have the $$ to easily swing this and i most likely wouldn't go unless i really really loved both people getting married.", "NTA stay home and celebrate your birthday with your parents. It\u2019s only a wedding anyway. His gf sounds abusive only abusers doesn\u2019t apologize when they are wrong idk why your brother wants her for his wife.", "It's not about the money. I sure as heck would not be going. The gf and her family sound Toxic AF.  Why would I want to waste 3K+ to be around people I don't like?  I'd rather jab a fork in my eye. NTA and don't go.  And if your brother asks, tell him the truth. He may find out later if you say it's one thing.", "NTA. Fuck that. Don\u2019t go to that wedding, don\u2019t even bother talking to them, your sister and brothers are both asses and the SIL sounds like a piece of work if she can\u2019t even apologize to her fianc\u00e9 when she hurts him as well?? That family sounds bananas. Don\u2019t go", "NTA. You couldn\u2019t pay me to go on a cruise", "First of all, get a travel agent. $3000 for a cruise is ridiculous, especially a year out. 2nd of all, you had me at \"I can't afford it\" and then got double points for it's your 30th birthday. I've been on a cruise for someone's wedding and it was 2 hours flat. Leave the remainder of the story out for your brother, and party your ass off on your 30th bday.", "NTA and don\u2019t go on a boat with people who want to kill you, even if someone else foots the bill.", "NTA!! Don't go seriously, stick to your boundaries but if you have screenshots send them to your brother, he needs to know.", "NTA. Death threats and your sister thinks you should still go. The expense aside, nope. Hard no.  Save your money and time for your 30th birthday. Do something fun with your friends. If your brother ask why say \" I cannot afford it. Your fiancee lied about me and her family made death threats toward me. I refuse to rug sweep that. It my birthday and I will not spend it with your fiancee and her family. Best of luck for your future.\" From what he said about his fiancee he is going to need it.", "Oh come on, who doesn't want to go on a cruise with someone who's threatened to kill them?  Sarcasm of course, but the price alone is reason enough not to go.  If you can't afford it you can't afford it.  NTAH.", "i would try to sabotage that wedding as much as i could tbh. death threats? rly? so NTA", "Why is your brother still marrying someone/ into a family who madr death threats against you?
