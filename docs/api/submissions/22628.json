My oldest brother, 37, has decided to propose to his girlfriend and straight away they decided they were going to go on a cruise to get married. They usually do cruises so this wasn't abnormal for them. They invited my parents, other siblings and myself, along with her family. Each person was to pay their own way. \n\nAfter long discussions, I explained to my parents that I had 2 reasons that I couldnt/didn't want to go. Reason 1, I live alone and don't have that kind of money. I don't have a partner, so everything I pay for is out of my own wage. The total for myself to go would be close to $3000, and I was told there would be no help from family to pay for it. \n\nReason 2, my brother's girlfriend and family had made death threats towards me a year ago and I haven't spoken to them since. A year ago my brother's girlfriend accused me of talking bad about her, so she went to Facebook and wrote a status which her \"friends\" and family commented with death threats toward me. I've never gotten an apology, even after the truth that I hadn't done what I was being accused of came out. All I got from my brother was, \"she will never apologise, even when she hurts me she will never admit she is wrong, just move on\". \n\nMy parents are on my side of this and they don't like her family, so now they have decided they aren't going to the wedding/cruise either. My sister has started planning to go and has accused me and my parents of being rude and disloyal towards my brother for saying we aren't going. My sister won't listen when I explain I would be uncomfortable if her family were to start anything like they did a year ago with me and I wouldn't want to ruin their time or waste my money if I got upset and spent all my time in the room on the boat. \n\nI've only told my brother that I can't afford the cruise so that's why I won't be going, I've left out the issues I have with his girlfriend's family as to not upset him. The cruise is a year away, so I am still debating on whether I can swing the money to go, but without my parents there I feel like I would be ganged up on if anything were to be said or happen. I'm also a bit upset because the date they have chosen is my birthday, my 30th birthday, and yes a cruise would be nice to celebrate but as my family have stated, \"nothing would be about me, it's only a birthday, nothing would be celebrated for me\".", "created_utc": 1689757431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153pmhs/aita_for_not_going_to_my_brothers_weddingcruise/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't feel safe and \u00a33k is not a reasonable about to spend on someone else's wedding. They'd better not expect gifts when they're making everyone pay for themselves. That is *not* how weddings work. They should be covering AT LEAST half of the cost, if they want people there. His girlfriend sounds awful and your brother needs to grow up and leave her. He sounds so downtrodden and it's honestly so scary that he didn't dump her immediately, when her family threatened your life. You should have reported them all to the police.

I say that if you want to go on a cruise for your birthday, do so. You don\u2019t have to go on the one they are going on. Get some of your friends to go with you. What would be fun is if your parents went with you. Kind of an in your face to your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Whatever you do, don\u2019t throw it in their face. Say nothing. If they find out about it they didn\u2019t hear it from you. I would be snarky and go somewhere that is exciting and a dream to go to. BTW, you can put a deposit on a cruise and make payments on one. \n\nIf your brother says anything, say that his fianc\u00e9 has violated you in the worst way, and not one word of ownership for it. That you don\u2019t want to be in the same city as her let alone on a ship with her and her family. That he is welcomed to marry her and live with her as this is his choice. However, she is not welcomed in your home or life. Any apologies now is too late, as she would be doing it for the wrong reason. Along with her family and friends.", "NTA. Nobody should feel obligated to attend a destination wedding, but your reason #2 is the most important one to give it a miss. Sorry not sorry, future SiL is going to have to learn how to apologize, as does every family member and FB friend who posted death threats. And I\u2019m not sure what country you\u2019re in (guessing not the U.S., given your spelling of \u201capologise\u201d), but public death threats might be a crime. \n\nPlease plan a crackerjack 30th birthday celebration with your parents and post lots of photos on social media.", "What is really the question here?

They planned their wedding for the date of your 30th birthday? Like deliberately? Regardless, based on what you\u2019ve said about how her family treated you, that would be an immediate no from me.

Dateline would not approve of you going on this cruise.", "NTA, you can\u2019t afford it. It simply stops there for what you tell your brother. As he has made it very clear that he doesn\u2019t care that his fianc\u00e9 and her family made death threats towards you. It\u2019s weird though your sister doesn\u2019t mind that either, but maybe y\u2019all have beef lol. \n\nBut why would you want to celebrate her coming into your family? She will never apologize, so I don\u2019t think you ever have to engage with her again. \n\nIt\u2019s also your birthday, and if they cares about you they would make time. My birthday fell on my friends bachelor party. I did not expect it to be the focus or really brought up at all, but they still made time for me and acknowledged it. We had a ton of fun.

It\u2019s your damn honeymoon? What do you want us there for? \n\nIt gets better. They had a honeymoon registry website from the destination sent to everyone on their guest list with everything from buying roses to champagne to EXCURSIONS for the bride and groom.
