My BF, who will graduate with a degree in English and get a TEFL certification, will be working as an English teacher, earning about **$1K per month**.\n\nWe estimate that our cost of living in Thailand will be $1.6K per month. I thought it would be fair for each of us to pay half of these costs ($800). I also made it very clear that I would be doing my absolute best to keep costs down since I want to save/invest as much of my money as possible for our future. \n\nMy BF, however, thought my proposal was *extremely* unfair. He claimed that since I would be earning 12x more than him, it was my obligation to help him out. He also said that because his father was threatening to cut him off if he did not pursue law school after graduation (he hates law studies, BTW, hence why I proposed that he become an English teacher), he needed his $1K more than I did.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting that my boyfriend for half of our living expenses in one of the most affordable countries on the planet?", "created_utc": 1675720529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vjfpe/aita_for_insisting_that_my_boyfriend_pay_half_of/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I made that much money, I\u2019d gladly pay all of my rent and encourage my partner to save his money for his own sake, because I love him. Technically what you\u2019re asking for is fair, but I still think YTA for your attitude.\n\nAlso, the fact that you laid out your exact salary and position(s) makes you sound a little insufferable.", "YTA. $800/month is 80% of his salary, and 6.4% of yours. Forcing your BF to go 50/50 on something he clearly cannot afford is cruel, irresponsible and frankly bordering on financial abuse. Expenses are meant to be shared relative to income, not to your arbitrary standards.", "YTA you want him to use 80% of his income on bills while you use less than 7% of your income. He's right that it isn't fair, you could both give 12% of your income or at least aim to be closer than him using 80% of his income.", "YTA how is 50/50 fair? Why wouldn\u2019t you do something more proportional to what you both make? To leave him with $200 per month while you\u2019ll have $11,700 left over each month seems really imbalanced.", "There is no one proper way to distribute income and expenses in a relationship, it's what two people, together, decide is fair. \n\nThat said, with a 12 to 1 discrepancy in income, a 50/50 split in expenses would make YTA.", "Yes, YTA.  You could easily pay 2/3 in \"the most affordable place to live in the world.\"Put yourself in his shoes.  You are saying \"save for our future\" but in reality if it doesn't work for him it's your nest egg.", "Yta. While you shouldn't need to pay 12x as much as him, you should take care of a larger portion. Him paying half leaves him with only 200 disposable income, and you have over 11000 disposable income. If I were in that position, I would not expect him to pay more than 500 a month so he can start to build himself up. What you are doing is forcing him to struggle paycheck to paycheck while you can save 90% of your income. Your behavior is selfish and shows that you don't care about your boyfriend.", "YTA, he's going to earn 1k per month and you want him to burn through 80% of that purely on housing costs while you are rolling in money in comparison? That's not what a supportive partner does. Unless you are willing to live in the type of housing that he can equally split with you while only spending about 30% of his monthly salary, then you are being wildly unfair.", "YTA equal is not the same as equitable. Assuming you and your bf are \"equal\" partners, then you should contribute equitably to your living expenses. You want to spend 6.4% (800/12500) of your monthly income while having your bf spend 80% (800/1000). You're left with 11700 each month while he's left with 200 each month. This is not equal. \n\nPeople in relationships with very high income difference ideally should pay for their expense equitably. This means you both contribute the same percentage of your income.  E.g. you both pay roughly 10%. You still get to keep +10k monthly, while your bf gets to keep 900. \n\nIf you don't want to pay for your bf... then, seriously, reconsider dating someone who makes so much less than you.", "I understand the whole \"even share\" but you want him to basically give over his paycheck to live while you would barely notice the dip. Yeah, 50/50 is the even bit but honestly, to want him to give 80% of his income to living and you fork over what, less then 10%? Let him contribute say 40/50% of his income so he has cash to actually live, pay for a meal or date more then once without going bankrupt in the month and honestly, the maybe 15% you pay isn't going to be a huge drain on your finances like you are expecting him to pay.\n\nSo yeah, going with YTA because seriously, it just feels cruel.", "Info: Will you also be expecting him to contribute to the utilities and groceries every month with the $200 he\u2019ll have left after rent?

I work a 9-to-5 as a marketing analyst and a side hustle as a content marketer/SEO consultant/YouTuber (all remote), earning $150K per year (**$12.5K per month**). My BF, who will graduate with a degree in English and get a TEFL certification, will be working as an English teacher, earning about **$1K per month**.\n\nWe estimate that our cost of living in Thailand will be $1.6K per month. I thought it would be fair for each of us to pay half of these costs ($800). I also made it very clear that I would be doing my absolute best to keep costs down since I want to save/invest as much of my money as possible for our future. \n\nMy BF, however, thought my proposal was *extremely* unfair. He claimed that since I would be earning 12x more than him, it was my obligation to help him out. He also said that because his father was threatening to cut him off if he did not pursue law school after graduation (he hates law studies, BTW, hence why I proposed that he become an English teacher), he needed his $1K more than I did.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting that my boyfriend for half of our living expenses in one of the most affordable countries on the planet?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
