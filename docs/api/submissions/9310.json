My BF, who will graduate with a degree in English and get a TEFL certification, will be working as an English teacher, earning about **$1K per month**.\n\nWe estimate that our cost of living in Thailand will be $1.6K per month. I thought it would be fair for each of us to pay half of these costs ($800). I also made it very clear that I would be doing my absolute best to keep costs down since I want to save/invest as much of my money as possible for our future. \n\nMy BF, however, thought my proposal was *extremely* unfair. He claimed that since I would be earning 12x more than him, it was my obligation to help him out. He also said that because his father was threatening to cut him off if he did not pursue law school after graduation (he hates law studies, BTW, hence why I proposed that he become an English teacher), he needed his $1K more than I did.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting that my boyfriend for half of our living expenses in one of the most affordable countries on the planet?", "created_utc": 1675720529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vjfpe/aita_for_insisting_that_my_boyfriend_pay_half_of/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I made that much money, I\u2019d gladly pay all of my rent and encourage my partner to save his money for his own sake, because I love him. Technically what you\u2019re asking for is fair, but I still think YTA for your attitude.\n\nAlso, the fact that you laid out your exact salary and position(s) makes you sound a little insufferable.", "YTA. $800/month is 80% of his salary, and 6.4% of yours.

Expenses are meant to be shared relative to income, not to your arbitrary standards.", "YTA you want him to use 80% of his income on bills while you use less than 7% of your income. He's right that it isn't fair, you could both give 12% of your income or at least aim to be closer than him using 80% of his income.", "YTA how is 50/50 fair? Why wouldn\u2019t you do something more proportional to what you both make? To leave him with $200 per month while you\u2019ll have $11,700 left over each month seems really imbalanced.", "There is no one proper way to distribute income and expenses in a relationship, it's what two people, together, decide is fair. \n\nThat said, with a 12 to 1 discrepancy in income, a 50/50 split in expenses would make YTA.", "Yes, YTA.  You could easily pay 2/3 in \"the most affordable place to live in the world.\"Put yourself in his shoes.  You are saying \"save for our future\" but in reality if it doesn't work for him it's your nest egg.", "Yta. While you shouldn't need to pay 12x as much as him, you should take care of a larger portion. Him paying half leaves him with only 200 disposable income, and you have over 11000 disposable income. If I were in that position, I would not expect him to pay more than 500 a month so he can start to build himself up. What you are doing is forcing him to struggle paycheck to paycheck while you can save 90% of your income. Your behavior is selfish and shows that you don't care about your boyfriend.", "YTA, he's going to earn 1k per month and you want him to burn through 80% of that purely on housing costs while you are rolling in money in comparison? That's not what a supportive partner does. Unless you are willing to live in the type of housing that he can equally split with you while only spending about 30% of his monthly salary, then you are being wildly unfair.", "YTA equal is not the same as equitable. Assuming you and your bf are \"equal\" partners, then you should contribute equitably to your living expenses.

This is not equal. \n\nPeople in relationships with very high income difference ideally should pay for their expense equitably. This means you both contribute the same percentage of your income.  E.g. you both pay roughly 10%.

Yeah, 50/50 is the even bit but honestly, to want him to give 80% of his income to living and you fork over what, less then 10%? Let him contribute say 40/50% of his income so he has cash to actually live, pay for a meal or date more then once without going bankrupt in the month and honestly, the maybe 15% you pay isn't going to be a huge drain on your finances like you are expecting him to pay.\n\nSo yeah, going with YTA because seriously, it just feels cruel.", "Info: Will you also be expecting him to contribute to the utilities and groceries every month with the $200 he\u2019ll have left after rent?

OP's bf sucks b/c he skated by using Daddy's and OP's money to fund a lifestyle for which he does not have the competency to contribute to.    \nIMHO, OP's bf needs to stick around for grad school.

I work a 9-to-5 as a marketing analyst and a side hustle as a content marketer/SEO consultant/YouTuber (all remote), earning $150K per year (**$12.5K per month**). My BF, who will graduate with a degree in English and get a TEFL certification, will be working as an English teacher, earning about **$1K per month**.\n\nWe estimate that our cost of living in Thailand will be $1.6K per month. I thought it would be fair for each of us to pay half of these costs ($800). I also made it very clear that I would be doing my absolute best to keep costs down since I want to save/invest as much of my money as possible for our future. \n\nMy BF, however, thought my proposal was *extremely* unfair. He claimed that since I would be earning 12x more than him, it was my obligation to help him out. He also said that because his father was threatening to cut him off if he did not pursue law school after graduation (he hates law studies, BTW, hence why I proposed that he become an English teacher), he needed his $1K more than I did.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting that my boyfriend for half of our living expenses in one of the most affordable countries on the planet?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Thailand is one of the most inexpensive places to live and you are supposed to be a couple. if the roles were revered this wouldn't even be a post is would be assumed the guy would pay my wife makes alot of money and she would never do me this way you suck !", "INFO:\n* Why are you moving to Thailand?\n* Why did you suggest your bf go for a degree as an English teacher?\n\nEdit: Going with YTA for now because you could easily spare more money a month so your bf could also have some money on the side until he makes a career for himself.", "Imagine if the roles were reversed. We all know that you would expect him to pay all the rent. We know it. You\u2019re the major AH. And he should dump you", "YTA.  Are you going to complain that he can\u2019t pay for dates or gifts, too?", "ESH\nWhat's up with all the demands? And why only a few months before his graduation do you both finally get down to planning moving to a new country?\nBoth of you are making demands that don't seem to match your current level of commitment. \n\nWhat you should do depends a lot on what you want the relationship to become. The 50/50 split sounds more like what you would do with an acquaintance than an SO. The 80/20 sounds more like what you might do with a spouse. If the two of you intend to make it work you probably need to find a compromise, as it looks likely that your income levels are probably not going to equalize. His will likely be steady but small, while yours will be larger but prone to fluctuate.", "YTA and you sound insufferable", "YTA and not a very good partner.", "I don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re TA I am curious tho why you\u2019re not open to a more equitable split? Like 60/40 even would be better. \n\nYou make A LOT more than he does. You can afford to contribute more and save whereas he seemingly won\u2019t. \n\nINFO: Why are you set on 50/50?", "YTA\n\nMost partner splits are done along lines of percentage of income. It's the most fair.\n\nIf you can't stomach that because you out-earn your partner by an order of magnitude, call it an incompatibility and break up", "Yes YTA, if you want to be with this person seriously and moving into another country together  i would consider finding a middle ground, you will be able to save even if you take on more of the bills whereas he will  not .", "YTA. \nYou\u2019re treating him like a roommate, not a partner who you are trying to build a life with. \n\nEssentially, you\u2019re having him spend 80% of his paycheck on living expenses while you spend 6-7% of yours comparably. \n\nMove somewhere more affordable for his income if you expect 50% of the living expenses to be paid by him, or come up with a more equitable arrangement.", "You are worse than a loan shark! Have you never heard of a sliding scale fee?!? The audacity and greed that eminates from this post is nauseating. You are a HUGE AH!", "80% of income? Thats crazy noone would or should do that.\n\nIf you only willing to do 50/50 you should cut down on expenses. I bet you weren't looking as much on the price for rent etc. because you can afford it. You're bf cannot.\n\nEither find a place in which it is affordable for him or pay more percentage. Right now you're an AH.", "Instead of doing 50/50 paying for living expenses why not just come to an agreement where he does household chores, buys all the groceries and such? He's gonna be left with 200$ until his next paycheck while your left almost 12k. YTA big big time.", "Why do so many relationships people post about here seem so transactional?", "NTA imo. I think people should share living expenses no matter their differences in salary. However, if it was your idea to move to Thailand, start fresh there etc it\u2019s kinda harsh to ask him for 80% of his salary just for the basic expenses.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s your boyfriend. Not your husband. If he can\u2019t afford the lifestyle, he needs to have a different one.", "Eh, you're not married, so 50-50 is only fair. After marriage, I could see changing that a bit if you keep finances separate. Even then, 50-50 is fair even if it isn't equitable. \n\nNTA", "NTA but both of you need to figure shit out", "I don\u2019t know\u2014I can see how she would consider that income very temporary and trying to save every penny. Being an influencer is going to last maybe another 5 years or so before the younger set takes over. \n\nThough I do think 70/30 would be more fair.", "it also makes it sound fake. but yeah if real insufferable and an AH. bf should not move, it badly effects his income and not her's", "all so she can put some into savings. Like lady you could pay the entire thing and would still have a ton to put into savings vs him with 200 left for everything", "All of this.", "Yep. OP needs to understand that \"equal\" and \"equitable\" are not the same thing.", "Quick maths", "All I could think while reading that was that BF is subsidizing OP savings.

This is not being equal. How does her having over $11k left over every month and him having $200 left over every month equate to equal in any sense..? (Not negating you commentor, agreeing with rage.)\n\nAlso, since you work from home, remember, you're using most of the internet, more electricity than him, more water than him, more of all the utilities than him, therefore, you **SHOULD** pay more because you're the one using the utilities more than he would since he doesn't WFH.\n\nYTA. Jesus people are exhausting.\n\nETA: Equal would be yall getting a shared bank account that all of your money goes into and you both get to spend (whatever yall agree upon amount wise) out of there.", "See I assumed the 1.6k was all inclusive of \u201cliving expenses\u201d so rent, utilities, and food all included and he has $200 left per month. I feel like he should pay $500 per month and she cover the rest that way he can start to save so at some point they can be 50/50. I also wonder whose idea it is to move because if its his and for his benefit then that changes it for me a bit because OP can stay where she is and do what she is already doing. Now if they are moving for her then yea it makes her much worse.", "Ooof. I mean, I kind of agree with your advice\u2014but the guy is only 22 and this seems to be his first job post-graduation. As a former English major who makes 6 figs, I wouldn\u2019t want to condemn the guy to a life of poverty! People who are good writers and can construct a clear argument are needed in all fields.

She seems to be settling for someone with little drive in comparison to herself. Why is that? Sure, she doesn't have to sacrifice her savings for him, but that goes both ways. And since she doesn't want to help him out financially while he figures out what to do with his life, she should let him go live a life he can afford, and she should focus on finding a romantic partner that can financially keep up with her. Otherwise, she is just shooting both herself and him in the foot.", "I really don\u2019t like how he blames her for BS with his dad.  \nOP is still a jerk but that really is some kind of childish mentality.", "Then that means he can't live with OP. But OP wants him to live with her at his detriment.", "yup, don't move and dump OP should help. not moving makes him earn more then when he does move.", "Then OP should agree to live in a house that the BF can comfortably afford on his salary. She's asking him to live beyond his means so that she can be happy at his expense. That's not fair. That's pretty messed up.", "Totally agree. Even in Thailand, 1k a month salary likely means renting a bedroom in a shared house or living in a small studio. So unless OP is willing to settle on living in a shared home with multiple other people, or in a small space in a not great area, then she needs to pay for the increase in standard of living. If she needs a BF who can afford everything 50/50, and she's not willing to compromise on how they are living, then clearly she needs a BF who makes more money thank 1k a month.", "you would think any adult knows rent should be 30% income, rising to max 50%. Not very market aware to not see how spending goes.", "I completely agree. That\u2019s exactly why I laid it out like that.", "Then they can find a cheaper place. But she shouldn\u2019t have to pay more just bc she makes more.", "She can just take it all to the grave then"]}
