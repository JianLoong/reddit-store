Keep setting boundaries!\n\nCongratulations and best wishes.", "NTA. I personally wouldn\u2019t accept their offers to pay for things like this moving forward either because it seems like they\u2019re going to use these things as control over you and your girlfriend and will throw these \u201cnice gestures\u201d in your face when they don\u2019t get their own way.", "NTA\n\nAny help or gifts with strings attached. Don't do it. \nNever ever.", "NTA your side of the family is drama\u2026 you\u2019re building your own family.  This is a good exercise, you\u2019re starting to build and  practice your boundaries.  Please protect your partner and baby.  Your sister is being very aggressive. I feel like she\u2019s a pretty glaring problem and she\u2019s bringing up some decisions you and your partner should both come to agreement with.  I think really consider if you can really trust the people who are offering help before you start relying on these people and making big decisions like moving etc.  be smart don\u2019t just give in because it feels easy and they\u2019re so \u201cgenerous\u201d obviously something like a gender reveal should be on your terms your sister is acting like she owns your baby.", "NTA; this sounds like your mom and sister are making this pregnancy and baby about them. It\u2019s absolutely not. They are not the parents.", "NTA. It's not really a gift if it comes attached with a bunch of conditions. They're using this to exclude your wife's family for whatever reason. You're better off paying for the scan yourself so you aren't pressured into doing what they want.", "NTA - start setting boundaries now, because if you don't, your sister and mother are going to walk all over you & especially your girlfriend.", "Your family sound unkind, and controlling. Your sister used paying for this scan as a power play - both to insert herself and your mum into a private moment between you and your partner, AND to exclude others. It's really not nice at all. \n\nMy advice is to set this boundary and hold it firmly. No one had a right to your gfs body or the baby you're having. There is no taking turns, concept of 'fair' between different grandmas, etc. This is about what your gf wants because it's her body, and secondary to that what you want. \n\nI'm sorry and sad that your family is playing silly buggers instead of just supporting you. I suspect this will get worse so definitely hold firm. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It seems your family has some control issues. Your sister only offered to pay for the scan so she could hold it over your head so you do as she says, i.e. it was help with strings attached. I would be weary of any offer of help from them because it will come with strings attached. Look at how your MIL reacted when you talked to her about it and compare it to how your family behaves when it comes to the situation at hand.", "NTA. Keep siding with your partner,  and start going lower contact with your mum and sister. They are starting to get controlling, which will only get worse after the baby is born. Set boundaries NOW, do not let them overstep, keep them back. Do not let your sister or mother have the baby to stay with them alone, ever.  I would not trust them.", "NTA. Shut this shit down now. You are not entering into custody agreement with your sister. It is not her baby", "NTA.  Your mom chewed you out for calling her with the baby news\u2026I was already scratching my head at that, and you seem to accept that makes you an asshole.  With crap like that permeating your life, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re on here for the rest of this.  Your mom and sister sound like real pieces of work I\u2019m sorry to say.   Your mom goes on to insinuate you were baby trapped, then her and your sister go on to say only your side of the family should be in on gender scan?    It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s paying for it, everything regarding your life is for you to decide who\u2019s included.    \n\nYour girlfriends mom sounds like truly a gem by the way.", "NTA - your sister and mum are being weird and territorial. You and your girlfriend need to set expectations now as it\u2019s only going to get worse. \n\nI strongly believe that neither side of the family should be prioritised over the other in terms of participation as it creates problems. However it\u2019s also important that the pregnant person whose growing & birthing the baby gets what they want and need, they come first. It\u2019s about finding the balance between that.\n\nYour family needs to learn to compromise. If they find it strange meeting your partners mum at a scan, why not arrange a meal before so they can be introduced!\nAlso there is absolutely nothing wrong with ringing your mum for support after a shock. I don\u2019t get what the issue is about her finding out over the phone. Would she prefer that you just freaked out and not seek reassurance? You were NTA in that scenario as well and had nothing to apologise for - but it does make me wonder if there is a pattern of you having to appease unreasonable behaviour from your family?", "NTA and good that you stood up for your core family! Your mother\u2019s and sister\u2018s behavior is not at all okay, they treat your gf as an object/incubator by inserting themselves into a doctors appointment and deciding who else can or cannot attend the spectacle. Also, paying for something with such conditions is NOT a gift. A gift would be paying for it and letting you decide if, and whom you wanted to be there.\nKeep putting your foot down and set hard boundaries now - it\u2019s only going to get (way) worse once baby is born.", "NTA, however, since it is bringing up so many problems: \"Sorry, outsiders, since you do not respect our decision and keep on harassing us, we decided to have no gender reveal appointment and everyone just needs to wait till the baby is here. Also, sex given to you at birth might not match your actual gender, so we will be raising them gender neutral till they are old enough to decide for themselves.\" #micdrop", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Quietly distance yourselves until you\u2019re in a less vulnerable state. \n\nIf you have relationship problems in the future, avoid going to your mother. Find a neutral friend if you need to vent. New babies are hard and you will have the lowest points in your relationship as you adjust.", "Nta it sounds like your sister is showing controlling behaviour and giving gifts with strings", "NTA.  A lot of your post is about what your sister wants.  Does she want the baby?", "NTA. If they had stayed from the start when they offered we\u2019ll pay for it but we decided who can come you would have said no straight out. \nThey lulled you into a false agenda (the gender scan) only to hit you with the true intention which is to do something so their pride and ego can rise above your gf family and make them seem more important than them. \nThe fact that they have questioned you about you moving closer to your gf family, suggested that they have the baby every second weekend and not care about the gf family and your mum questioning if your gf baby trapped you is a HUGE concern. \nThey are either jealous of your relationship with your gf\u2019s family and are trying to insinuate themselves into your life\u2019s so make them seem more important or they have very little care or regard for your gf/her family/your relationship. \n\nI had this petty jealousy bs from both sides (my ex\u2019s parents and my mother) and it put a huge stain on my life and relationship. It caused a very big issue with the wedding planning and on the day of the wedding. \nIf you can\u2019t find out the cause & make attempts to resolve it (unless they are just incredibly selfish/self-centred people) then it will only get worse and each time you try to plan something with all families present it will end up uncomfortable and there will be snide remarks from your family.", "Nta.

I was always brought up believing I was being unreasonable and it's only in the last few years I've been able to break away more. So you're right, I shouldn't question how I told my mother about the baby.

Also they might cause problems about who gets to be in the room when the baby is coming.", "Hang on, so this is the 20 week morphology scan, not a bonus let\u2019s find out the gender scan? Mate this scan is about so much more than what the baby has between it\u2019s legs. It\u2019s not a spectator sport, it\u2019s a serious health appointment that can have some very serious outcomes.", "Oh about the baby shower. My mum suggested two separate showers for each family. I said that's not happening. What's sad is the rest of the family who have sympathised with us don't want to step their foot in to avoid conflict.", "Wow. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re putting your foot down. Maybe sit down with your mom and sister and find out the real reason behind this. A baby is suppose to bring both families together. Why are they working so hard to have everything separated. Maybe they are just being hateful for no reason, which is bad.", "NTA.\nYour mom and sister are jerks though.\nThey are not being nice or considerate to your partner. And next time if your mom mentions baby trapping remind her that it takes 2 people to get pregnant. Birth control if you don\u2019t want kids is BOTH peoples responsibility. Even if one person is on the pill the other should wrap it up. \nPill can fail for many many reasons it\u2019s not fool proof. \nYour mom has definitely insinuated shit to your partner, time to shut that down. \n\nPay for the scan yourself and invite who you both as parents want. \nYour sister also has no rights to the baby, any weekend or baby sitting plans have to be done by the 2 of you. \n\nAnd please back up your baby mama\u2026, ur mom and sis sound like people who will force her to have them in the delivery room. \nChoice of delivery room support people is 100% only on your partner. Not even you, since your privates are not exposed to the entire galaxy.", "NTA and to be honest your side of the family sounds pretty toxic to be honest. I know that sounds dramatic, but consider:\n\nAside from all the rest there\u2019s absolutely no way that your mother should be upset about hearing about the pregnancy over the phone. Absolutely nothing wrong with that in the slightest. \n\nYet she was apparently upset at you. \n\nAnd just that little thing has you thinking that you\u2019re possibly an asshole. \n\nSounds to me like you\u2019ve been \u201cwrong\u201d your whole life and are constantly having to apologise. Does your sister ever do things wrong? Could she be considered a golden child by any chance?", "NTA. Offering a gift with strings attached is no gift at all. It\u2019s pretty gross if your mom to be mad you told her over the phone and imply your gf baby trapped you but also demand she and your sister be the only family involved, they\u2019re both trying to push your gfs family out of the picture (and any other family of yours they don\u2019t like, like your Dad). I\u2019d be careful about accepting anything from them, including future childcare because they\u2019ll likely hold it over your head and demand they be the only family to see ir take care of the baby. Set boundaries now and hold firm to them. \n\nI\u2019m going to give you some advice that isn\u2019t relevant now but will be in the future. Your mom and sister absolutely seem like the type that would demand to be there for baby\u2019s birth or immediately after and I just want to say don\u2019t allow it. Don\u2019t tell them what hospital you\u2019re using, when your gf goes into labor, ask nurses that you not be registered so they can\u2019t call around and find out where you are and what room you\u2019re in, even tell nurses that you don\u2019t want them there so they can make them leave just in case they do show up. Keep the boundaries up even after the birth of your baby as your gf shouldn\u2019t have to come home immediately after giving birth to deal with your mom and sister. I give this advice because it happens all too often that a partners family is overbearing and oversteps boundaries or he keeps up boundaries then gets guilt tripped into things at the end of the pregnancy and then puts his partner in uncomfortable situations.", "For the sake of your partner, please put very firm boundaries in place immediately. Your sister particularly sounds ... obsessed with your baby. And that's the trouble: this is YOUR baby with YOUR partner, not hers in any way. \n\nTake some time to have a serious heart-to-heart with your partner, deciding what each of you is comfortable with regarding both families. Then as a team give all pertinent information to both families. Something along the lines of \"We have decided that (partner) and I will no longer be participating in (activities/gatherings/etc) until both of us feel respected regarding our baby and the planning for them (or whatever conditions you agree on).\" \n\nDon't include any details of any appointments or results of scans or anything.

If there is something revealed that could be upsetting to your gf, will she want anyone besides you with her?", "She could have chosen to feel honored that you told her first, but she was looking for a way to make you feel badly, so you would feel like you owed her something.", "Sounds like your mum and sister will make everything about your baby into a competition. You will need to step up and protect your child and partner.", "If these are the boundaries you have set in place make sure to stand by them! Before we knew we needed to have a c section with our 1st baby BOTH my mom & MIL were pushing DAILY to be allowed in.  My MIL kept saying she'd be there...even when I said no...she was just so hell bent on being in there! My own mother took the other route and kept trying to guilt trip me.  Finally the day of my doctor told me we needed a c section.  Most don't want one, I was so happy lol.  I would have rather dealt with the c section after care than the bitching of the moms lol.", "Glad you're seeing the manipulation for what it is. Don't be afraid to put your foot down and set ultimatums. Especially the idea of your sister wanting to have your baby every weekend seems bizarre. They need to know before the baby is born that this is *your* baby and that neither of them will have any say in how that baby is raised. Also, I bet the next demand is letting them in when your girlfriend is giving birth. Do not let them.", "You just need to stop talking to your sister and mom about the pregnancy. They have no place in it, and their opinions on any part of it are completely irrelevant.", "Agree - they all need to understand people\u2019s boundaries.", "The way you are letting them or doing what they are doing. \n\nI\u2019d of cut them off when your sister first started. She\u2019s going to be so much worse when the baby actually comes. \n\nYou need to grow a backbone and look after your little family and stand up to them both. It\u2019s weird as fuck man", "Or to see how \"old\" baby is.. Conception date", "I fully agree.\n\nOP, you _apologized_ for telling your mom about the pregnancy over the phone?? Wth? Why would anyone guilt you for that? It\u2019s nonsensical. And now your family is bullying you because you refuse to let them exclude people from a scan of YOUR child? What is going on here?\n\nI think you need to take a BIG step back. Put your family on an information diet, pay for the scan\u2014if you even want it\u2014by yourselves, and practice saying, \u201cThanks but no thanks! We\u2019re going to do things our own way.\u201d\n\nYou and your girlfriend are the parents-to-be here. On all things child-related, no one else\u2019s opinion matters.\n\nNTA", "I'm sorry you went through that. I was often told my mum has flaws but she's not the worst. But to me, that just isn't good enough. People have their flaws by all means but they also have to hold themselves accountable and learn from things. My mum never properly admits when she's wrong and my sister has said I should accept that it's never going to change. I do have a contact for CBT who I went to and did talk about issues with my sister but never my mum. I'll give her a call.\n\nThank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Op's self awareness is impressive. Especially considering the family pressure and the impending arrival of a baby.", "Your mom sounds exactly like the type to complain about HOW she was told even though she was told FIRST\u2026sigh\u2026good luck ha", "You did not need to apologize one but for how your told her. You did nothing wrong. And I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let it affect how you told your dad.", "That\u2019s exactly what she was expecting, but could you imagine that happening and the mum not being happy about the news? How awkward would that be?\n\nProtect your partner, I get the feeling that your sister wants to play \u201cmum\u201d or third parent, don\u2019t let that happen otherwise your sister and mum will insist on being in the delivery room, first cuddle, birth announcement on FB and so on", "Exactly. Or, in other words,  she wanted OP to make it all about her.\n\nShe and the sister.\n\nHowever, when it comes to actually offering support, they seem unable to do it without attaching all sorts of conditions to it to force everyone to accomodate to **their** needs and **their** feelings.", "That\u2019s what the mother said?", "The only person that got a face to face telling was my boys\u2019 dad. Everyone else was FaceTime/text lol. Or Facebook for some people lol. That old handy dandy post lol.", "I'd be fully NC at this point but I have zero tolerance for this kind of shit.", "If you were pregnant at the time, his \u201cblood\u201d _was_ in the frame with you. Utter AHs. They, not you.", "Youngest is 6. It's up to my partner of course but I don't think they should be shopping alone together.", "This one in question is the bonus scan to find out the gender and then eventually reveal the gender to loved ones.", "The post said that I said no to them after excluding her family. My sister has since tried to \"rectify\" the situation but I have told her we are booking our own scan.", "True! And OP should realize this is just the beginning of the power plays  his family is going to pull to have the baby all to themselves and alienate his gf\u2019s family. Time for OP and his gf to set firm boundaries with his family and do not allow sister to pay for anything & try to dictate who comes.", "  NTA.  Makes me realize how lucky I am that my Mom\u2019s narcissism is more passive.  Everything is all about her.  We are all clearly just a part of her narrative.  But she doesn\u2019t actively mess with me beyond vying with my Wife for attention a little.", "I never fully realized what a monster my mother was until I became a mother. I was always told that I'd understand her parenting \"once I got older and had kids.\" I guess she was right. I did understand it. I understood that she was an shit parent who failed me entirely. I never treat my children the way my mom treated me and we are all better for it. It takes years to get the perspective to recognize how our parents behaviors affect us in the long term. You are already ahead of the game by recognizing the toxicity of these behaviors. Dont let them fool you. You are doing the right thing.", "You seriously don\u2019t want to find your wife posting to /r/justnomil one day.", "It is obvious that your mom favoured your sister by treating her like a princess just because your sister agrees with your mom's lies. You and your girlfriend are a couple and should be treated nicely. You're NTA OP, where has your dad been in all this if you have/had one at all and if he is living.", "Oh god what a nightmare.", "Shes got baby fever.", "At the 20 week scan one can usually see the gender.", "Yeah but how long are you going to continue this and not cut her off?", "My dad lives about 3 hours away with my younger brother and other sister. The sister in question in this post is technically my half sister (different dads). I've told him about this situation and he's disgusted by their attitude. He offered to talk to them for me but I said no because I want to be able to handle it. I don't see him much but he's planning to come down either later this month or next month.", "Must be scarlet baby fever.", "I'm not going to, my partner and the baby are my priority. If they're going to have this attitude, they won't be included.", "oh ok", "You need to cut them off now. No more chances"]}
