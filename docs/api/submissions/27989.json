Generally, everyone was very happy about the news. However because of the shock I felt at the time (it wasn't planned), I called my mother for reassurance and it helped. She wasn't happy I told her over a phone call which I understand and am likely an AH for. I apologised and we put it behind us. \n\nMy sister has been supportive, she helped us move to a new house, wanted to take my partner out baby shopping in a few weeks. However, my mother was less helpful. We had a facetime mid August about housing options, then my mother randomly asked me about if my partner was on the pill. I said yes and I've seen her take it, and she asked if I was sure. Almost like she was insinuating that I was baby trapped.\n\nI have had worries about my sister. I'm happy she's excited but I feel sometimes she's too much. She was talking about having the baby every weekend so we could do stuff as a couple, and I said we have to consider both families. She was also concerned about us moving a bit closer to my girlfriend's family than mine. She said I wouldn't get as much support and questioned the support from my partner's as her mother lives 2 hours away. I said she comes down every weekend to look after her mother with dementia, we'll be fine.\n\nMy sister offered to pay for our gender reveal scan. We both thought this was a lovely gesture and said yes. My sister understandably wanted to come because she's paying for it. My sister told me that the one she was booking allowed up to five people to come and suggested we bring my mum along. I then said if she's coming, then my girlfriend's mum should come too. She disagreed because it's the only involvement they'll have during the pregnancy and my girlfriend's family will be at other events. We said it's not about who we're including, it's about having support during a personal appointment, and my girlfriend doesn't want only all my family there. My mum previously said either it's just my family or no scan. I said fine, we'll pay for it ourselves. My sister then messaged my girlfriend to explain her reasoning which left her in tears.

We think this kind of reasoning is selfish and not putting our wishes first. \n\nMy mum and sister are getting me to understand their reasoning. I do understand it, I just don't agree with it. My girlfriend's mum isn't bothered by them not wanting her there, just more by how it's affected us. She told me not to worry about them and hugged me. She said she's happy to pay for it and for me to invite whoever I want. \n\nThis is a post here because despite many agreements about our side of things, I have doubt because my sister was going to pay for it.

This wasn't an offer of a gift--it was a power play.\n\nYou said no to your sister's conditions, because she made your pregnant partner cry. Good for you! Keep setting boundaries!\n\nCongratulations and best wishes.", "NTA. I personally wouldn\u2019t accept their offers to pay for things like this moving forward either because it seems like they\u2019re going to use these things as control over you and your girlfriend and will throw these \u201cnice gestures\u201d in your face when they don\u2019t get their own way.", "NTA\n\nAny help or gifts with strings attached. Don't do it. \nNever ever.", "NTA your side of the family is drama\u2026 you\u2019re building your own family.  This is a good exercise, you\u2019re starting to build and  practice your boundaries.  Please protect your partner and baby.  Your sister is being very aggressive. I feel like she\u2019s a pretty glaring problem and she\u2019s bringing up some decisions you and your partner should both come to agreement with.  I think really consider if you can really trust the people who are offering help before you start relying on these people and making big decisions like moving etc.  be smart don\u2019t just give in because it feels easy and they\u2019re so \u201cgenerous\u201d obviously something like a gender reveal should be on your terms your sister is acting like she owns your baby.", "NTA; this sounds like your mom and sister are making this pregnancy and baby about them. It\u2019s absolutely not. They are not the parents.", "NTA. It's not really a gift if it comes attached with a bunch of conditions. They're using this to exclude your wife's family for whatever reason. You're better off paying for the scan yourself so you aren't pressured into doing what they want.", "NTA - start setting boundaries now, because if you don't, your sister and mother are going to walk all over you & especially your girlfriend.", "Your family sound unkind, and controlling. Your sister used paying for this scan as a power play - both to insert herself and your mum into a private moment between you and your partner, AND to exclude others. It's really not nice at all. \n\nMy advice is to set this boundary and hold it firmly. No one had a right to your gfs body or the baby you're having. There is no taking turns, concept of 'fair' between different grandmas, etc. This is about what your gf wants because it's her body, and secondary to that what you want. \n\nI'm sorry and sad that your family is playing silly buggers instead of just supporting you. I suspect this will get worse so definitely hold firm. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It seems your family has some control issues. Your sister only offered to pay for the scan so she could hold it over your head so you do as she says, i.e. it was help with strings attached. I would be weary of any offer of help from them because it will come with strings attached. Look at how your MIL reacted when you talked to her about it and compare it to how your family behaves when it comes to the situation at hand.", "NTA. Keep siding with your partner,  and start going lower contact with your mum and sister. They are starting to get controlling, which will only get worse after the baby is born. Set boundaries NOW, do not let them overstep, keep them back. Do not let your sister or mother have the baby to stay with them alone, ever.  I would not trust them.", "NTA. Shut this shit down now. You are not entering into custody agreement with your sister. It is not her baby", "NTA.  Your mom chewed you out for calling her with the baby news\u2026I was already scratching my head at that, and you seem to accept that makes you an asshole.  With crap like that permeating your life, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re on here for the rest of this.  Your mom and sister sound like real pieces of work I\u2019m sorry to say.   Your mom goes on to insinuate you were baby trapped, then her and your sister go on to say only your side of the family should be in on gender scan?    It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s paying for it, everything regarding your life is for you to decide who\u2019s included.    \n\nYour girlfriends mom sounds like truly a gem by the way.", "NTA - your sister and mum are being weird and territorial. You and your girlfriend need to set expectations now as it\u2019s only going to get worse. \n\nI strongly believe that neither side of the family should be prioritised over the other in terms of participation as it creates problems. However it\u2019s also important that the pregnant person whose growing & birthing the baby gets what they want and need, they come first. It\u2019s about finding the balance between that.\n\nYour family needs to learn to compromise. If they find it strange meeting your partners mum at a scan, why not arrange a meal before so they can be introduced!\nAlso there is absolutely nothing wrong with ringing your mum for support after a shock. I don\u2019t get what the issue is about her finding out over the phone. Would she prefer that you just freaked out and not seek reassurance? You were NTA in that scenario as well and had nothing to apologise for - but it does make me wonder if there is a pattern of you having to appease unreasonable behaviour from your family?", "NTA and good that you stood up for your core family! Your mother\u2019s and sister\u2018s behavior is not at all okay, they treat your gf as an object/incubator by inserting themselves into a doctors appointment and deciding who else can or cannot attend the spectacle. Also, paying for something with such conditions is NOT a gift. A gift would be paying for it and letting you decide if, and whom you wanted to be there.\nKeep putting your foot down and set hard boundaries now - it\u2019s only going to get (way) worse once baby is born.", "NTA, however, since it is bringing up so many problems: \"Sorry, outsiders, since you do not respect our decision and keep on harassing us, we decided to have no gender reveal appointment and everyone just needs to wait till the baby is here. Also, sex given to you at birth might not match your actual gender, so we will be raising them gender neutral till they are old enough to decide for themselves.\" #micdrop", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can even see why they wouldn\u2019t want to meet your partners mom at a doctors appointment. It\u2019s weird and clinical and I get it. \n\nIt sounds like you need to sit them down and have an honest conversation and set up some boundaries.

In fact, you'd be the ah if you accepted it, knowing that it's jsut a way for your sister to control your gf and you. Time to have a serious conversation with your mum and sister well you tell them that your gf and your baby are your priority, and that while you love and appreciate them, they need to accept that your life is now different and doesnt centre on them anymore. They need to understand that your needs as a couple come before their wants for their life. They are welcome to be a part of your lives as long as they are respectful of you and your gfs boundaries and choices, but the current situation has made you see how much they push their priorities on you, even where they conflict with your own", "NTA, seems she\u2019s only paying to have control.

If you don\u2019t take the pill at the same time every day, it is less effective. Antibiotics can cancel out the pill. She probably didn\u2019t baby trap you. Next time get a vasectomy or use condoms with spermicide plus maybe the bc shot for her.

You\u2019re pressed on. Sometimes your bladder or bowel is on screen. Depending on who\u2019s doing the scan scary problems with the baby/placenta can (heaven forbid) be picked up.\n\nIt\u2019s already an inappropriate gift but frankly it\u2019s sick and a really horrible power move to have strings attached to block out your girlfriend\u2019s family and support system.\n\nYour sister and mother will probably exhibit more neurotic, pushy behaviours as the due date approaches and as the baby arrives. Quietly distance yourselves until you\u2019re in a less vulnerable state. \n\nIf you have relationship problems in the future, avoid going to your mother. Find a neutral friend if you need to vent. New babies are hard and you will have the lowest points in your relationship as you adjust.", "Nta it sounds like your sister is showing controlling behaviour and giving gifts with strings", "NTA.  A lot of your post is about what your sister wants.  Does she want the baby?", "NTA. If they had stayed from the start when they offered we\u2019ll pay for it but we decided who can come you would have said no straight out. \nThey lulled you into a false agenda (the gender scan) only to hit you with the true intention which is to do something so their pride and ego can rise above your gf family and make them seem more important than them. \nThe fact that they have questioned you about you moving closer to your gf family, suggested that they have the baby every second weekend and not care about the gf family and your mum questioning if your gf baby trapped you is a HUGE concern. \nThey are either jealous of your relationship with your gf\u2019s family and are trying to insinuate themselves into your life\u2019s so make them seem more important or they have very little care or regard for your gf/her family/your relationship. \n\nI had this petty jealousy bs from both sides (my ex\u2019s parents and my mother) and it put a huge stain on my life and relationship. It caused a very big issue with the wedding planning and on the day of the wedding. \nIf you can\u2019t find out the cause & make attempts to resolve it (unless they are just incredibly selfish/self-centred people) then it will only get worse and each time you try to plan something with all families present it will end up uncomfortable and there will be snide remarks from your family.", "Nta.

Surely for a gender reveal, if you want to do such a thing,  should just involve the parents. Can't you just tell everyone else to mind their own business.

It's not her child,", "Yeah it's been a similar case when I was younger.

Most couples with a newborn do being with the new born as their prime activity.  I mean an offer to help out once in a while would be nice but every weekend?", "I accept that I need to set better boundaries for myself. I was always brought up believing I was being unreasonable and it's only in the last few years I've been able to break away more. So you're right, I shouldn't question how I told my mother about the baby. I confided in her and if my child did that with me, I'd appreciate them trusting me with being the first one to go to for advice. Now this behaviour is affecting someone I love deeply and I'm not allowing it to happen anymore.", "# Clap hands", "I grew skeptical with comments here and there, but this situation made the intentions more clear.

No exceptions.", "Yeah, originally it was meant to be just my sister and then her sister at the 20 week scan.

Feels like \"good cop, bad cop\" to me.", "She was telling me about being on a shopping spree for the baby and how my BIL had to tell her to calm down. She played it off as a joke. She told me she dreamed of being an auntie and cried when we told her the news.", "I moved away for university and other things because my sister was often making me run around and do favours for her. And even then, she tried to suggest me be 30 mins away. I moved 4 hours away to be more independent. \n\nI pulled an all nighter once and went to sleep. She woke me up to ask me to go into the GP to get her prescription. My sister is also desperate for her own 4th child. Oh yeah I forgot to mention she already has 3 kids.", "I wouldn\u2019t stand for it, because the next big thing will be your baby shower and they might try to control the whole thing as well. Just say the MIL comes or they don\u2019t at all. What\u2019s so hard about saying HI at the baby scan, no big conversation needs to happen. They are over thinking it and being mean. Also they might cause problems about who gets to be in the room when the baby is coming.", "Hang on, so this is the 20 week morphology scan, not a bonus let\u2019s find out the gender scan? Mate this scan is about so much more than what the baby has between it\u2019s legs. It\u2019s not a spectator sport, it\u2019s a serious health appointment that can have some very serious outcomes.", "Oh about the baby shower. My mum suggested two separate showers for each family. I said that's not happening. What's sad is the rest of the family who have sympathised with us don't want to step their foot in to avoid conflict.", "Wow. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re putting your foot down. Maybe sit down with your mom and sister and find out the real reason behind this. A baby is suppose to bring both families together. Why are they working so hard to have everything separated. Maybe they are just being hateful for no reason, which is bad."]}
