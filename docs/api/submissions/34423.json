So sorry this happened to you and so sorry your parents did not do the right thing.  I can't help but wonder if your brother is continuing this behavior with his own children, their friends or whomever.  There is no way you can be expected to be in the same room with someone who abused you like this.  \n\nYour parents clearly let you down when they basically opted to sweep things under the rug rather than call your brother out and make sure you felt safe in your home.  You don't owe them anything while they all owe you a huge apology for not properly protecting you.  Of course you are in the right not to deal with these people ever again.  \n\nI know it hurts when our parents fail us and it hurts to know they will never right the wrongs.  Since this is how it is for you, protect yourself and your children and avoid these people.  They do not deserve you.  Be around people you can trust who love you as you deserve.  Get more counseling to help you put all this behind you.", "NTA. I\u2019m 59. I finally told my brother to fuck off and went NC. My sister begged me to forgive him because it happened so long ago. I told her and everyone else in my family if they don\u2019t like it, they can fuck off too. I have been in therapy for two years now and it has been empowering. All these adults have failed you. \n\nDoes your brother have daughters? Report his ass to Children Services. You can do it anonymously.  You can out your very toxic family. \n\nOp, please find a good therapist. I\u2019m rooting for you dear.\n\nEdit: Consult a lawyer. You may be able to sue your parents for not protecting you from a monster.", "NTA - Get as far away from them as possible and get help.\n\n>Because family is important, and to not have a relationship and cut off them entirely can be wrong in certain circumstances.\n\nDon't be fooled by traditionalist beliefs. You can 100% choose your family. Family is important, but if the one you were born into treats you like garbage, then you can go find another one. Your family is whoever you want them to be.", "whoa..................................................................... uhm... well definitely NTA.", "I am so sorry this happened to you.
