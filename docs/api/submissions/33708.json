The 12 year old got really sick on the 23rd.. the eve of Christmas eve.  103.8 fever, aches, tummy hurt... he just felt lousy.  I put him to bed and he stayed there all day on the 24th.  By that night, he still was very sick.  Normally we open family presents on Christmas Eve, but we decided to wait. \n\nMy 12 year old is at that age where I don't think he believes, but he WANTS to so after I put him to bed, Santa came and we all crossed our fingers there would be a Christmas miracle and he would feel better. \n\nBy Christmas morning, when we normally open Santa presents, he really tried to get up - he took a shower, said he was well enough to go down and see what Santa brought, but took one look at the presents, turned right around and went back upstairs and crawled into bed.  I said we would wait to open gifts until he was better, but one of my teens had an attitude about it all day and tonight my husband said he felt bad that we made the kids wait to open their gifts.   Now I'm second-guessing everything.  I thought it would be cruel to let the kids open their gifts while their little brother was sick upstairs but tonight my husband said we should have let them open their gifts and he has me feeling like an asshole.  I suppose I could have picked out a couple of gifts for them to open, but I have no idea which gifts are which... Santa wraps everything in red paper and many of the packages look similar.  Even though they have the kids names on them, I have no idea which gifts are which, so it's hard to pick out a couple... I didn't want one kid to open a pair of socks and another kid to open their \"big\" gift. \n\nTonight, my 12 year old seems to be improving a bit - his fever now around 102 but he stayed in bed sleeping all day and I'm just really hoping he's MUCH better tomorrow.  Not only does he feel lousy, he feels like he ruined Christmas (which I keep telling him not to worry about). \n\nSo, basically I didn't think I was asking too much for making the kids wait, it's not like I'll make them wait for days and days but my husband now thinks that making them wait was wrong.  Maybe it was.  Maybe I am an asshole for making my older kids wait to open their Christmas presents until their little brother felt well enough to join them.  So I really want to know... am I the asshole?

It\u2019s unfortunate your one son was sick but not opening gifts on Christmas Eve and giving him the extra night in hopes he\u2019d recover was quite far enough. You basically ruined Christmas can you imagine all their friends texting about the excitement and your kids are sitting wising on Timothy.  Very weird and wrong choice on your part.", "YTA\n\nJust because your kids are older doesn't mean Christmas morning magic is gone. If you live in an area where celebrating Christmas is common, and you have traditions behind it, they have likely been looking forward to that moment for a long time. Talking to their friends about it, getting texts etc from friends about what they got.\n\nIt's great that one of your teens was okay, but to be upset at the 2nd one is irrational...I think a lot of people regardless of age would have felt the same. To look forward to that tradition and have it taken away feels like you are punishing them. Whenever you open gifts now, it's just not the same.", "It is *not* cruel to delay Christmas due to illness or other issue. As a tween, I had one delayed Christmas due to my sister having an emergency appendectomy. Another couple of times we delayed Christmas because my mother had to work the night shift. It\u2019s good for children to experience putting empathy in practice like this. Talk gently with them, and show them empathy, too.", "YTA. You literally babied your baby at the expense of everyone else's Christmas. The fact that you can't even begin to see what you did wrong leads me to assume this isn't the first time one of the older kids suffered because you decided to put your baby first.", "NAH\n\nThis feels like a rock and a hard place situation. Being sick on holidays feels worse than a regular day. And there\u2019s something about opening gifts on Christmas morning/day that feels special and magical and never gets old, so I can understand your teenagers feelings of disappointment.\n\nOn the other hand they are teenagers not little kids and unless you didn\u2019t explain your feelings or reasoning at all, should in some way understand why you paused Christmas. Acting out, muttering under your breath, and generally making your displeasure known does nothing to make you feel better and just spreads the misery.\n\nOn the other hand, your youngest is also 12 not a small child. Its entirely possible that he would have understood. I feel like with a bit more communication you could have figured out a solution, but it\u2019s too late for that now. \n\nI hope everyone is feeling better tomorrow!", "YTA, but not ill-intentioned.\n\nI'd apologize to the other kids and let them open gifts ASAP. Your youngest will understand. \n\nI'm going to say...your 12 year old doesn't believe in Santa. I was grown out of the magic of that logic by the time I was 6. A kid believing in Santa in earnest past 8 is dubious to me unless they're developmentally delayed. I know kids sometimes WANT to show that they believe in Santa because saying otherwise makes their parents sad.\nJust make sure you aren't putting that strain on your son.", "YTA\n\nYou have to understand that your kids are not joined together at the hip.\n\nWhat one kid does or says or feels will not affect the other kids.\n\nIf the youngest is sick, let him wait to open his own presents.\n\nBecause right now, you're just punishing the others because their little brother got sick.\n\nWhich is massively unfair.", "YTA\n\nIt was wrong to stop the other children from opening their presents. You should listen to your husband", "YTA - what if someone else gets sick tonight? Will Christmas be delayed until January?", "YTA. Get your son tested for COVID, flu, strep and RSV and once diagnosed administer the appropriate treatment. Having a high fever for three days straight tells me he's quite ill...and also likely contagious. It's likely you're all going to be sick soon so you better let your other kids open their presents now before they're in bed with a fever too.", "What is your plan if what 12 has spreads to others? Delay opening until the last person feels better or open anyway? What if he's not feeling better and you and your husband have to go back to work? This could stretch out quite a long time to accommodate everyone. You should have discussed what to do with the teens and your husband and not unilaterally declared everyone must wait.", "YTA, although possibly unintentionally.\n\nHonestly, just apologize to your kids. Tell them the truth, you weren't thinking about the situation fully, you didn't think of other options and you love seeing them open gifts together but loving to see that wasn't fair to them or their feelings.", "So instead of Christmas just sucking for the one kid who's sick, it now sucks for all of the kids. YTA, and I think you know it. Hope you can find a way to make it up to them. \n\nGood luck. It's a Christmas no one will ever forget.", "YTA. Your sick son would not have minded and it was unduly hard on the others. They were nice enough about missing the christmas eve opening, no reason to prolong the wait and risk resentment of their little brother. It's about time you became more organised with presents. You need to be able to distinguish between them after wrapping. I suspect you are the only one keen to continue the Santa pretence. I can't imagine his peers allowing it to survive.", "You are the biggest AH \u2026 your youngest being sick has nothing to do w your older kids, u basically punished them for him being sick", "definitely with the majority of gentle YTA. you aren\u2019t intentionally so and it really isn\u2019t the biggest deal of your life. the others should have been able to open their gifts, and maybe you could have brought a few up to the sick one. \n\nalso, check with his doc to make sure he\u2019s ok. i\u2019m a total hypochondriac but a near 103\u00b0 fever makes me nervous \ud83d\ude05", "Teens will still have a hard time waiting and they might resent their brother, or they might resent you. It sucks that one kid is sick, but don\u2019t make everyone suffer. NTA but if it comes up again let those who aren\u2019t sick at least open up a few.", "I've scanned the comments and I'm surprised at the responses but I'm going NTA. I had Christmases growing up that got pushed to later dates because of sibling illness, parents working, bad weather, etc. I never minded or threw fits because it wasn't about the date, it was about the day. You want to keep that Christmas joy and wonder alive for your child even though they're sick. There is nothing wrong with that. I hope your baby is feeling better soon \u2764\ufe0f", "103.8 is a dangerously high fever, YTA, but not just about the presents. That kid neede to be at the drs office.", "NTA. As the eldest sibling, I wouldn\u2019t want to open my presents, knowing my younger sibling is too sick to even get enough energy to open his own. Even this year, when we\u2019re all adults, my family is holding off on opening presents until Boxing Day, because one family member couldn\u2019t be home on Christmas Day. \n\nYour husband should be having your back in helping to teach your older kids to have empathy for their younger brother.", "I agree that not everyone has to open gifts at the same time, but that said, kids older than twelve are not babies. It doesn\u2019t kill them to wait. \n\nAt the same time, why don\u2019t you know which gifts are which? In our house, the gifts Santa brought were not wrapped but were laid out under the tree. \n\nWhat you could have done was let each of the older kids choose one or two gifts to open, with the understanding that they wait until their brother was better to do the rest. And they get what they get. If one gets a big gift and the other a small one, they are old enough to understand that these are not all of the gifts and they too have a big one that they just haven\u2019t found yet. You could have made it a game. There are so many ways to handle this. Going forward, maybe Santa needs to wrap his gifts in different paper and Mom and Dad wrap theirs  themselves, so you have an idea what they got.", "It sucks, but YTA. I\u2019m sure you can tell the difference between at least the majority of the gifts. You could\u2019ve let them open most of their gifts and tried your best to be fair about the gifts or just let them pick x number up front themselves and even if it\u2019s lopsided it\u2019s based on their choice and it will even out eventually. Kind of like Hanukkah one kid might get socks the night another gets a video game but in the end it all evens out. \n\nAlso, what exactly is your plan if tomorrow a different kid wakes up with a high fever?? Are you potentially pushing back presents a week or more while you take turns each getting sick?", "Agreeing with the gentle YTA rulings. Even if the 12 yo wasn\u2019t feeling well, why did he have to be practically exiled to his room? He couldn\u2019t lay on the couch and spend time with the family and watch the present opening? \n\nYesterday my family was reminiscing about Christmas\u2019 past. My mom talked about a Christmas where she was super sick and laid on the couch while her sister unwrapped all her gifts for her and then showed them to her. If you wanted to find a solution for everyone, you would.", "YtA. You already know you had messed up. Frankly, you youngest probably feels bad that he is the reason why no one got Christmas. \n\nEveryone's feelings matter, and you displayed an unfair favoritism there towards your youngest. \n\nYou need to go talk to your older kids and apologize for messing up, and then make amends in a way that you can all agree on.", "Soft YTA. Its not the teens' fault their sibling is sick and Christmas is still special to teens no matter how much they refuse to show it. The youngest had his chance, and he walked away. \n\nYou could have just asked him if it was okay that his siblings open their presents. I'm 99%, he would say yes. Then you wouldn't have gone through this mess.", "YTA,  period. It's not that soft either. \n\nApologize to your other kids. You really blew it. Making them wait was just ridiculous. \n\nAnd stop with the 12 year old pretending he believes on Santa. That's just pathetic.", "YTA\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you taken him to the doctor yet? And why make everyone miss out on their gifts just for one person?\n\nYou could\u2019ve just made him open his gifts in front of everyone once he felt better instead of ruining everyone\u2019s Christmas for him and making him feel bad about being the cause of the ruined Christmas when it\u2019s your fault.", "nta, But you should know what presents you got and have given the other kids something to tide them over. They are certainly old enough to practice compassion and hold off on celebrating until their sibling is better and being pissy all day is kind of ridiculous \u2014 but I have sympathy for them getting all excited and being let down on the holiday. A compromise would be the best approach.", "YTA", "YTA but we all make mistakes .Always weigh your decisions with the thought \u201c By this decision am I making my other children feel like they  matter less than the child I am doing \u201c whatever \u201c for \u201c ??\nKids keep count .Various Needs /Disabilities can cause parents to feel that one child deserves special treatment because Life has handed them a raw deal.But doing without to help someone is a learned behavior of kindness.Children look to their parents for affirmation that they are valuable.You told the other 2 that they were not as important today\u2014 on Christmas .They will not forget this .", "YTA. I understand not wanting him to feel left out, but you shouldn\u2019t have made the other two kids\u2019 Christmas experience revolve around what your youngest wanted or didn\u2019t want to do. 12 year old made it apparent that he didn\u2019t feel like opening gifts, you should have let your other two open theirs, or at least one or two big ones. Also, he\u2019s TWELVE and you think he might still believe in Santa?? Did I read that right?", "NTA. Worst case, the older kids should learn patience and empathy with a seriously ill sibling.\n\nYou hoped they'd have to wait at most a night, now it's turned to more than a day, it's time to give it up and let the kids share gifts with the youngest while best keeping him quarantined.\n\nThe kids are acting pretty entitled considering the youngest can't enjoy any of the festivities, but they're not ah, they're just selfish kids... pretty standard.\n\nI really hope your husband is putting on a united front with you otherwise the older ones who are already entitled are going to start resenting you.", "So you didn\u2019t want to be cruel to one kid so instead you were cruel to 2 kids? And the worst part is now the sick kid feels like he ruined things, so you basically made all of your kids upset. YTA", "Yup, YTA. Well intentioned maybe.\n\nBeing sick is shitty and at Christmas all the more so. But you set the youngest attendance as the key to everyone else's holiday. No 12yo no fun for everyone. No idea what you thought you were doing but, congrats, no one is happy.", "YTA, but very very gently.\n\nI've been the super sick one on Christmas and it's not fun. I already felt bad enough, but knowing everyone else would have had to wait for me to feel better to open their presents would have made me feel worse. \n\nI agree with other commentors - you should have set 1 gift each aside to open together and allowed the kids to open the rest of their presents. Letting the kids pick which to open together could have added to making it a special moment.", "NTA Christmas is about family. Everyone can wait until it can be celebrated together. My family would never dream of celebrating while someone was so sick.", "YTA kind of", "YTA.\n\nYou might have meant well, but your teenagers don\u2019t give a shit about opening gifts together. You probably want them to do it together for your benefit, which I get for a parent, but I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for a teenager to be excited for Christmas, and they find out that morning that they don\u2019t get to open presents. I\u2019m sure that majorly disappointing for them. \n\n> Not only does he feel lousy, he feels like he ruined Christmas (which I keep telling him not to worry about). \n\nPoor kid. Obviously, it\u2019s not his fault, but your teenagers are for sure going to remember this as the year Mom wouldn\u2019t let them open presents on Christmas\u2026so, you know, there\u2019s that.", "YTA. If I was the 12 year old that was sick, I would have told my family to open away. If they can't understand that sometimes things aren't fair, like they are sick and their siblings aren't so they slept while presents were opened then you need to start having more conversations with your kids. It's. Ot like they would open his gifts or that you were returning theirs because they were laid up in bed.", "NTA - you're asking the family to wait one day in hopes everyone is well enough to celebrate the holiday together. Your husband should have your back on this one and shouldn't be making you 2nd guess your decision. I hope your youngest feels better in the morning.", "HARD YTA why are you the ONLY ONE making these decisions? Why do you love your youngest the most? This whole thing is terrible, one gets sick so forget the other kid\u2019s happiness? You\u2019re the blame and now bc of YOU your sick kid will feel it\u2019s his fault bc his mom doesn\u2019t parent better\u2026smh you clearly stated only people in that \u201cfamily\u201d that matters is you and the 12 Yr old", "Hard disagree with all these 'gentle YTA' votes. Your kids in highschool don't believe in Santa anymore, but that doesn't mean Christmas is meaningless and you essentially cancelled it for everyone just because your youngest is sick. YTA and this would be a core memory for me, I would forever remember that Christmas only happens if mums favourite can take part.", "I\u2019m also going with YTA, especially if any of the presents are things the older kids would want to spend time using during their break before they\u2019re back to having schoolwork. For example, if I got a video game system and I lost two days I could play hassle free during my vacation? I\u2019d be annoyed. \n\nIf your reasoning was the kid maybe still believes in Santa, they saw the presents the morning of Christmas so they know they arrived. As long as nobody touches gifts marked for them, I don\u2019t know why it would be an issue.", "YTA. You denied your older children a Christmas because of the possibility that your 12 year old might still believe in Santa? And because you couldn\u2019t remember what you wrapped, they couldn\u2019t even open a single gift? You prioritized your 12 year old feelings and completely ignored the feelings of your other two children. I\u2019m shocked by all the \u201cgentle YTA\u201d. I have three kids, I can\u2019t imagine punishing two of them just because their sibling is sick. Not even hospitalized, just running a mild fever in the other room! That kind of favoritism is toxic. Your teens are rightfully upset and this will be a Christmas they remember for all the wrong reasons. You should apologize.", "A gentle YTA because I understand why you decided to do this but it's a really unfair thing to do. If you really want to give the older ones some gifts but not all then it's not rocket science. Send the older ones to their room for 20 minutes while you grab a pair of scissors and the sticky tape. Gently snip the tape and open their presents up just enough to see what they are, them tape them back up again and give them the ones you want to give them. I hope the young one feels better soon.", "Can I ask a question \nWhy didn't u just bring the gifts up to his room and open them there ? \nSo all of ur kids could of opened their gifts", "NTA. If tou're an asshole over this, I'm a much worse one--I would have gathered together the teenagers' gifts and taken then yo the nearest homeless shelter. Your teens are self-centered (redundant, I know!) but your 12-yo sounds seriously take-him-to-the-emergency-room SICK. (I lost a brother two years ago on Christmas Day. We weren't close, but I also spent time yesterday listening to friends talk about loved ones they lost on holidays.) Your family could have reined in their greed for a few days until your son was well enough to share what is SUPPOSED to be a joyous season with them! And NOBODY is *entitled* to gifts, not for Christmas, not for birthdays, not for weddings, never. That's not what a GIFT is.", "Soft YTA", "Gentle YTA, you meant well. But I think the moment of all opening presents together is actually more important to the parents. your son probably would have been fine with his siblings opening theirs before him.", "INFO: would you have waited to open presents if one of your older kids was sick instead of the youngest?", "NTA. \n\nYou did what a good parent should do, and prioritized a Christmas experience which should be done as a family. I would talk to your older kids matter of factly and ask them how they would feel if the positions were reversed and they had to miss out on opening their presents with everyone else because things had gone ahead just because they were sick! \n\nIf he's still sick tomorrow then I would say go ahead, however, or maybe see about taking his present up to him and getting him to open it there as a compromise? Set him up with a phone on Facetime or something so that he can watch from his bed? \n\nChristmas won't be 'ruined' by having to wait twenty-four hours -if anything in the years to come this might be one holiday that stands out a bit.\n\nEdit: I just want to add that I'm baffled by all of the Y-T-As here. What's the point of Christmas if you don't do it as a family, people? Like seriously. The whole point is to do it as a group and share the joy and the experience!", "In the future when your older kids don\u2019t get along with your younger kid, you may think back to this moment.", "I struggle with this, but soft YTA. \n\nI understand not wanting your son to miss out on the Christmas magic but this was also a moment where you could gently teach him that the world keeps turning even when you\u2019re ill and sometimes you miss out on moments. His presents from Santa had arrived and he had confirmed it, so I really don\u2019t think there was a reason to keep the older ones from opening their presents and spoiling their bit of fun. His gifts would wait for him. \n\nThere\u2019s also no telling when he will get better. You\u2019re betting on an unknown. He could end up being super sick for a week or more (though I hope not). Will you make them wait until New Years Day to open their Christmas gifts?", "YTA I could see if this was bc you had to take the 13 y/o to the emergency room and you wanted them to wait till you got back but to make them wait till he\u2019s better\u2026 that could be DAYS away", "YTA. I understand your POV,  but wonder if your 12 year old is the family golden child and is pandered too often? The older kiddos could have been given one or two presents to open; not just made to wait an undetermined amount of time. If the 12 year old is that unwell,  they could potentially be in bed for 2 or 3 more days.", "NTA. So the younger kid has to feel like he missed out on Christmas because of being sick? Instead of agreeing to wait an extra day so that they could all do Christmas together, the high-school-age kids are mad because of a decision you made to include their younger siblings? They sound like they're being selfish. Christmas is an event, not a specific day. Sometimes Christmas happens early (it was the 22nd this year for my family, because that was when we could all be together for it) sometimes it happens late. I think you made the right decision.", "I feel bad for anyone sick at Christmas and it always happens, someone gets sick.  No easy answers OP but the one response where the older kids get to open 1-2 seems reasonable.  My fear would be one starts feeling better and another goes down sick.  Might be awhile", "YTA, even though your heart was in the right place. A better thing would have been to let the older kids open their gifts and then when he felt better, to make sure the older kids participated when he opened his gifts. I'd have left the tree up and then when he was finally up to it, I'd have had one extra present for everyone so they would all still want to participate in his present opening together. \n\nThere is still time to make up for this!", "Gentle YTA. You could've gone up to his room to open presents or carried him downstairs and wrapped him up in blankets. I understand wanting to wait until he was feeling better, but, tbh, he's still running a fever and he's not going to feel better for a while. The minute he starts feeling better, he's going to overdo it, which will set his recovery back by a few days.\n\nEven though you're not asking for advice, I strongly suggest you call the pediatrician in the morning. I only say this because, while he could very well have the flu or covid, it could also be a nasty ear or sinus infection. I have had those go rogue (particularly an ear infection when I was 14 that nearly killed me because I'm a freak and can't feel them). They are not fun.\n\nHope your kiddo starts feeling better soon!", "Of course YTA.\n\nYou held up your entire family's holiday because one was sick? Why would that make anything better?", "YTA\n\nDon't teach your children that the world stops for them. Yes, some compromise sure as a family. But you literally cancelled Christmas for 1 child. \n\nAlso, I promise you your 12 year old does not believe in Santa. Maybe he gets extra presents from \"Santa\" so he's willing to go along with it. But he would be brutalized in school for voicing such a belief.", "Your 12 y/o looked at the wrapped presents and walked away as he wasn\u2019t feeling upto it.\n\nAt this point, it was fine to let the older ones open their presents as their names were on the wrapping paper! What\u2019s so wrong with letting them do that? YTA", "VERY gentle YTA. Maybe let the teens open all but 1 gift? That way they all still have 1 gift to open with their little brother. Just something to contemplate.", "YTA for not taking your kid to the doctor if his fever is that high, Christmas or no. At that temperature I hallucinate. \n\nYou're also the asshole for the Christmas stuff, but honestly it's all related. If you'd taken him to the doctor you'd know what he has (or maybe run a covid test or something) so he could either get help feeling better OR you'd know how long it will be before he will be better. With that information you could make a better decision about the gifts or not, and the other kids would understand more too.", "Mild YTA. Your other kids didn't do anything wrong and you set them up to resent the 12 year old. Not fair all around.", "NTA considering the whole point of Christmas is spending quality time with your family. The presents are just supposed to be a bonus and a physical way of showing love. If people really think that delaying gift opening so that everyone can do it together is \u201cruining\u201d Christmas then they should probably reevaluate what the actual point of Christmas is. Your other kids are old enough to show some compassion and understand that things happen and the family has to deal with it. It\u2019s not like you asked them to wait for days upon days. It was literally 24 hours. If they can\u2019t show some sympathy and understanding then perhaps they need to take a look at their entitled behaviour and do some volunteering to help them understand that Christmas does not equal presents", "YTA, but I do understand your reasoning. Santa magic is great but just because your older kids no longer believe doesn\u2019t mean that Christmas isn\u2019t still a magical time for them too. They\u2019ve probably been excited and looking forward to it for weeks, then the day comes and they don\u2019t even get to open some of their gifts? Seems like in trying to protect Christmas magic for your youngest you\u2019ve ruined it for your older ones and completely left them aside and I understand why they\u2019d be mad about it", "Gentle Yta it seems like your 12 year old would understand as he feels like he\u2019s ruined Christmas. You could have done half, it sounds like he\u2019s empathic about it", "YTA if you make them wait any longer. \n\nIf you need to delay Christmas a little if someone is sick or can't be there for whatever reason it's understandable, but if you don't let your other kids open their presents by the end of Christmas it's basically punishing them for their sibling getting sck.", "Idk there\u2019s a lot of way to go about this.Soft YTA for making an executive decision without consulting the family as a group including the sick kid. Unless your kids are complete assholes to each other I feel like there would have been some sort of work around to make everyone happy. I get that your 12 year old is the baby but I would feel way less important as the oldest kid knowing the world you brought us in revolved around mommies baby.", "YTA not for waiting, but for how you communicate with your older children.\n\nYou should have asked what they thought about waiting and discussed this as a family. They are old enough to choose the best and reasonable option. Instead, you decided on their behalf.", "YTA. Why do they need to open presents at the same time?

The 12 year old got really sick on the 23rd.. the eve of Christmas eve.  103.8 fever, aches, tummy hurt... he just felt lousy.  I put him to bed and he stayed there all day on the 24th.  By that night, he still was very sick.  Normally we open family presents on Christmas Eve, but we decided to wait. \n\nMy 12 year old is at that age where I don't think he believes, but he WANTS to so after I put him to bed, Santa came and we all crossed our fingers there would be a Christmas miracle and he would feel better. \n\nBy Christmas morning, when we normally open Santa presents, he really tried to get up - he took a shower, said he was well enough to go down and see what Santa brought, but took one look at the presents, turned right around and went back upstairs and crawled into bed.  I said we would wait to open gifts until he was better, but one of my teens had an attitude about it all day and tonight my husband said he felt bad that we made the kids wait to open their gifts.   Now I'm second-guessing everything.  I thought it would be cruel to let the kids open their gifts while their little brother was sick upstairs but tonight my husband said we should have let them open their gifts and he has me feeling like an asshole.  I suppose I could have picked out a couple of gifts for them to open, but I have no idea which gifts are which... Santa wraps everything in red paper and many of the packages look similar.  Even though they have the kids names on them, I have no idea which gifts are which, so it's hard to pick out a couple... I didn't want one kid to open a pair of socks and another kid to open their \"big\" gift. \n\nTonight, my 12 year old seems to be improving a bit - his fever now around 102 but he stayed in bed sleeping all day and I'm just really hoping he's MUCH better tomorrow.  Not only does he feel lousy, he feels like he ruined Christmas (which I keep telling him not to worry about). \n\nSo, basically I didn't think I was asking too much for making the kids wait, it's not like I'll make them wait for days and days but my husband now thinks that making them wait was wrong.  Maybe it was.  Maybe I am an asshole for making my older kids wait to open their Christmas presents until their little brother felt well enough to join them.  So I really want to know... am I the asshole? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP didn\u2019t call up the neighbors and ask them to not give their gifts out either. Putting something off a few days isn\u2019t canceling the holidays. The presents don\u2019t disappear at midnight if they\u2019re not opened.\n\nPersonally, being together with friends/family is what\u2019s important, not the gifts. If the gifts are what matter most, we must have grown up with different teachings about the meaning of the holiday.", "Probably. Maybe OP should have asked youngest if it was okay, and if it wasn't, then fine. He can wait until he's better to open his and the older ones can open theirs when they want to.", "THANK YOU. I wouldn\u2019t be able to feel well with myself with opening something and leaving out the youngest child who has a deathly high fever especially with the context of 1 million lives lost due to COVID and up to 20k annually during flu seasons.

Could\u2019ve been a lesson on this and sacrifice. Lol, and since I believe in God, I would\u2019ve made it whole lesson on God\u2019s sacrifice too and been like these worldly gifts are rags compared to the life of your child and God is a shepherd who goes after one lost sheep in favor of the greater good.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02*", "AH doesn't mean the same as if I walked up to you and called you one. It just means in the wrong. And she is. It sucks that 12 year old is sick but presents aren't the point of Christmas and honestly having at least *some* gifts will likely keep them occupied until school starts back up. 12 year old is old enough to understand the world won't wait for him", "Well, he told you he believed.  Mine admitted to around 27 that he did that hoping to get more gifts.", "Just curious, why is that a good thing? I'm honestly asking, because I felt like the world's biggest doof when I was the oldest of my classmates to still believe, and I was 10.", "My 13 still hasn't admitted it either but the inflection in her voice when she says Santa lets me know she knows.", "Pro tip: number the gifts and keep a master list somewhere so you know what\u2019s what. \n\nSource- I grew up in a house with 5 kids and the master list was how gift mixups were corrected.", "He's 12 of course he doesn't believe. In 2023 I'd be surprised if someone past 5 believes.", "I apologize. I came across as harsh and that was not called for. Each family has their own traditions that work for them. I hope your son gets better very soon. You were also under the stress of a sick child. I hope all of you have a great New Year's to make up for the sick Christmas.", "What about gifts from you, couldn\u2019t they have opened those at least? These are teenagers, emotions are all over the place.

You could have taken a few special things for him upstairs, some flat lemonade or whatever, and had a little mini-celebration for him with siblings in his doorway, then left him to sleep & everyone else get on with Christmas.  You don\u2019t cancel Xmas because one kid\u2019s in bed for a bit.  Heck, even kids bedridden with cancer still get Christmas when everyone else does and they certainly don\u2019t make everybody wait till they\u2019re \u2018better\u2019.  ffs", "Is it beyond the realm of possibilities to have grabbed a couple of wrapped gifts, gone to a different room, removed enough wrapping (carefully) to have checked what's inside and let the teens open the pre-approved ones? It's a good teaching moment for the teens to consider the unwell sibling, but some proactive thinking might have saved their day.", "He likely does not believe anymore, most don\u2019t by the age of like 8 because kids at school tell them that Santa isn\u2019t real (rude if you ask me). He may be trying to believe because he knows you expect him to! Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. I would have let my teens open one present and wait for the 12 y/o for the rest.

Doesn't mean I cancelled it for everyone else, nor would she expect me too.  I'll stop over later to bring her the baked goods I made for her.  That's how life works and 12 is old enough to start learning  these kinds of life lessons.  Otherwise that's when you get the horror stories of a 70 year-old insisting everything be on hold because they can't participate.\n\nAlso, no one is saying \"f\" the 12 year old.  They are noting that family could have still still found ways to include the brother, while still honoring tradition and letting the older children somewhat enjoy Christmas.

But annoyingly so. \n\nMany people do have Christmas on other days but generally this is communicated and expected. Instead the other kids here had to sit and wait for an unknown time for their Christmas to happen. Surrounded by festivities and gifts they could not indulge in. Given a false start, then told its not happening. The excitement and build up for it then to be cancelled until who knows when. You can see how that would be disappointing and frustrating. Enough so that the sick kid now feels guilty because even he recognises how the others would be feeling. \n\nI read your post and I should have phrased mine better. I meant for the presents to be opened in Christmas morning as per normal in the kids room. Not waiting more then doing that. Not giving it another day.

These teens seem like they were fine not opening gifts on Christmas Eve and waiting for brother to feel well but when they couldn\u2019t even open the gifts on Christmas that was where their sibling sympathy hit a snag.
