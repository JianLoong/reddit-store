People are enabling him and you have every right (and should) stop any and every contact that makes you uncomfortable.", "You\u2019re right.", "He has been married for over ten years. They seem to be doing okay but I have witnessed a lot of screaming matches over the years. He does not hold down a job. Every job he gets he gets into some sort of trouble. Harassment, problems with the boss, etc\u2026", "Why do you think  OP\u2019s brother\u2019s dating life and working life are relevant for OP wanting to go NC with her abusive brother? \n\nHer brother has been verbally, emotionally abusive for a very long time. OP is well within her right to distance herself from her brother\u2019s abuse that\u2019s not only affecting her, but also her SO and their child. She\u2019s NTA for doing that.\n\nHer mother is an adult who can make her own choices. If she wants to keep seeing, supporting and enabling her abusive son, she can. And OP acknowledges that fact, which is very emotional mature, because it must be painful for her that her mother condones the abuse towards her and her family.\n\nThe person who isn\u2019t an adult and doesn\u2019t have a choice is OP\u2019s niece. I assume OP\u2019s brother is also emotionally abusive towards her (because he is to all other people in his life) and I\u2019m concerned for the emotional damage he\u2019s inflicting on his daughter. Is she safe?", "It sounds above your pay grade to fix, then.  He needs professional help and to want to change.  You\u2019re right to protect yourself and your family, though.  Whatever his problems it doesn\u2019t give him a pass on treating anyone else badly.", "I ask the question because it is well known that abusive people, especially abusive men, are able to control themselves in public, at work, in church, in front of the police, in front of witnesses, in front of people that \u201cmatter\u201d.  When they lose control and break things it is seldom their own things that get broken.  When they hit people, they start by doing things that don\u2019t leave mark, then to places that can be hidden, then to times when the victim has time to heal, then to things that don\u2019t require hospitalization.  For someone out of control, it sure looks like deliberate choices to inflict maximum harm with minimum consequences.\n\nIf he really can\u2019t keep his shit together to hold a job there is something going on that might benefit from professional help.  As noted in Lundy Bancroft\u2019s work, \u201cWhy Does He Do That\u201d, abusive people almost never change on their own, and take their therapy seriously only when there are significant consequences.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t matter why he\u2019s being an ass, and OP is absolutely right to block access.  But if he was the sort of person who could hold his tongue at work or to get laid, OP would know that it was a choice and feel easier about going no contact.", "OP states that his behaviour has driven a wedge between her brother and many people in his life, like friends, coworkers and family. So his abusive behaviour cannot be that hidden and must be noticeable for the people around him. \n\nApparently his mother always enabled him and made up excuses for his behaviour (the A H behaviour OP describes has nothing to do with ASS and/or ADHD) without actually consulting a professional therapist. Doing nothing and stating \u201cthat\u2019s just who he is\u201d clearly isn\u2019t a good tactic for a child who displays abusive behaviour. And now he\u2019s an abusive adult. To be clear, I don\u2019t blame the mother for his behaviour, but I do think it\u2019s wrong not to act when you notice disproportionate unacceptable behaviour of your child.\n\nI agree OP\u2019s brother clearly has issues. But people can only be helped if they want to be helped, and only change if they want to do the hard work. The way OP describes her brother makes it seem like he doesn\u2019t even acknowledge his behaviour is rude and abusive. Until he does, he will never change. \n\nWhy he doesn\u2019t acknowledge his abusive behaviour we don\u2019t know. His mother stands by him no matter what, so maybe he doesn\u2019t feel the need. Or maybe he really isn\u2019t capable of it. But even if it\u2019s the latter, OP shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about not wanting to be abused by her brother and protecting her SO and child. No one should be expected to give up their own well being and mental health to not discomfort someone else. Even if that someone else is family.", "I have ADHD. Yes that does make us more prone to make uncouth comments and put our foot in it. However it isn't an excuse. I feel super bad when I realize or someone points out to me that I have said something wrong. I try and correct it and watch out for it in the future.  I also apologize. Your brother does not seem to have any remorse or awareness of what he is doing is hurtful.  He doesn't care.

Does your mother use that as an excuse but didn\u2019t get him tested as a kid?", "NTA.\n\nHere's a news flash for all those who justify the actions of loved ones as \"They might have X wrong with them.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're on the spectrum, mentally ill or have any other diagnoses - it's never, ever an excuse to be an asshole. The sooner that people internalize that  being an asshole is an **actual choice**, the better off we will ALL be.", "NTA. ADHD doesn't make you a shit person. Neither does Autism.

You are not the asshole at all, being surrounded by that energy sucks your life away, and it is not ur responsibility to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d when he is a grown adult. You do not need to emotionally compensate for him. I have for far too long and it has destroyed many of my highschool years and my family is on the edge of collapse.
