Your FIL and MIL are both delusional and they owe you an apology. No job is worth this, and now you got a glimpse of what kind of a boss he is.", "NTA. Are they willing to change their names?  I\u2019m guessing \u201cno\u201d. To expect someone to change their name to fit into society is a very antagonistic approach to their small minds and thinking.", "NTA. It's your name.

Are you going to be forever dodging manipulation attempts to get you to change your name? \n\nFor petty and funsies: tell them you've thought about it and spoken with your partner thoroughly about it. You two have decided to go ahead and change your name BUT since your name is so important to you, you partner will be changing their name to your current one.", "NTA, though, while good intentioned your FIL is, I doubt he can truly understand how you feel. I would recommend having a conversation with him that starts with you telling him about how much you love your unique name and telling him all the good things you have heard about his company.

NTA. Tell your in-laws that your name has not been an impediment to your career success so far, so you have personally had no reason to consider changing your name for any practical reason. And personally, you are happy with your name and feel it\u2019s part of you, so asking you to change it is a bit of a personal affront that you would prefer to ignore.

They'd be assholes for doing that, but there are plenty of assholes around, and if you want their business, you need to not call them out on it.  \n\nSo I think it's not completely unreasonable for him to say that you'd be a great hire, but he'd need you to go by a more conventional name.

I have met others that refused who were also succesfull..  \n\nLong way of saying that this is an unreasonable request and is premature.

If someone has an unusual name that works somewhere, if people talk about the name they will eventually start talking about the business they work for. Your name could increase his business.
