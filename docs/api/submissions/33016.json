No issues back then.\n\nRecently FIL has mentioned how much he would love to have me work for him. I thought it was a very sweet thing to say but he started getting more serious about it after a few weeks. He ended up asking me if I would actually be interested and I said it would depend on certain factors but it would be nice to work for the family business. He didn't say anything else right away but then a couple of days later he told me he was serious about wanting me to work there but I would need to change my name to something less \"embarrassing\" because the negative impact on his business was not something he was willing to risk and a ridiculous name is a sure way to harm your relationship with important business contacts.\n\nI told him I understood if he felt my name could not fit in with his business but I would not change my name so we should just forget the offer. For the second time when talking to him he was taken aback. Another couple of days passed and my husband told his dad he was crappy for offering me a job with conditions, like my name, attached to it. Then MIL told me it was a little hasty to refuse without thinking it over. I told her the thing is I love my name and don't want to change it for a job.\n\nFIL is offended that I wasn't willing to consider it. He told me it was an amazing place to work, which I do know, I heard great things from his employees and I should be willing to make a small adjustment so I can be more professional presenting in the business world. I told him I wasn't and his attitude about my refusal to change my name made me glad I hadn't agreed to work for him.\n\nNow both he and MIL feel I should have been more willing to compromise on my name.

Your FIL and MIL are both delusional and they owe you an apology. No job is worth this, and now you got a glimpse of what kind of a boss he is.", "NTA. Are they willing to change their names?  I\u2019m guessing \u201cno\u201d. To expect someone to change their name to fit into society is a very antagonistic approach to their small minds and thinking.", "NTA. It's your name.

Are you going to be forever dodging manipulation attempts to get you to change your name? \n\nFor petty and funsies: tell them you've thought about it and spoken with your partner thoroughly about it. You two have decided to go ahead and change your name BUT since your name is so important to you, you partner will be changing their name to your current one.", "NTA, though, while good intentioned your FIL is, I doubt he can truly understand how you feel. I would recommend having a conversation with him that starts with you telling him about how much you love your unique name and telling him all the good things you have heard about his company. Hopefully, he will understand that your quick decline of the offer wasn't for lack of consideration, but for connection to tour name and unwillingness already decided to make changes to it. \n\nI would hope he could listen and understand.", "NTA and wtf???", "I think the request is crazy, too. NTA. Tell your in-laws that your name has not been an impediment to your career success so far, so you have personally had no reason to consider changing your name for any practical reason. And personally, you are happy with your name and feel it\u2019s part of you, so asking you to change it is a bit of a personal affront that you would prefer to ignore.

If someone has an unusual name that works somewhere, if people talk about the name they will eventually start talking about the business they work for. Your name could increase his business.
