It was toxic relationship on both sides. We eventually went through a rough divorce when I was 30. We both got help for our trauma/issues and now have a great co-parenting relationship.

It was also her fianc\u00e9s first wedding. I felt terrible that she even questioned whether people would judge her. She had an awesome wedding and plenty of the family went and treated it like it was her first.", "NTA. It sounds like she's jealous.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s your sister or not, it\u2019s your wedding and your choice.", "Nta. Who exactly assigned her to host? They need fired as well. Im from the generation that you have 1 shower. 1 baby shower (unless there is a huge, like 10yr gap or tragedy), & all of that. I am also sane enough to know that things change. Even traditions. You are only given one chance at life, why live it in someone elses terms.", "Jeez your sister is so snarky.  Why would you WANT her to even go to the wedding.  It wouldn't surprise me if she got up and laid into in a speech.  Congratulations to you and your fianc\u00e9, NTAH on your part.", "Why do you have anything to do with your family?", "NTA and I'd consider uninviting the lot of them. Family is, to me, an action word. If blood relatives don't act like family, they don't deserve the title. Yours don't pass that test at all.", "NTA.", "NTA. I would go to NC with your cheap sister. She is really something else thinking she's the arbiter of YOUR wedding. This is your day and ignore this toxic person who used to be your sister.", "NTA. Tell her to stay away, and, honestly, keep her away from your wedding.", "Tell off your sister and tell her you are seriously considering uninviting her.  It's not her wedding her input is not wanted or welcome. If she cannot stop tearing you down you will go NC with her.\n\nYou're finally in a good place don't let her do this to you.  You don't have a choice on who your family is but you do have a choice about who you surround yourself with.", "NTA.\n\nAre you sure you want to even invite her to your wedding? Seems certain she would make a point of making mood-killing remarks. Are you sure you want her there to create bad memories? Would going NC at this point improve your life?", "op-NTA\n\nHave the wedding you want to have.  Tell your sister she is NOT a party of your planning committee and that her suggestions are neither welcome nor appreciated.\n\nWhether or not it's your first wedding, it's your Fianc\u00e9's first wedding and even IF it was a second wedding for both of you, it's none of her darn business how and what you plan.\n\nThe only obligation she has is to RSVP yes OR no and to shut up about everything else.", "It is 2023. The \"rules\" have changed and second weddings can be nice affairs with all the bells and whistles that go along with them. You're not being dramatic. This is your fianc\u00e9's first marriage and he deserves to have as lovely a wedding as you both want. Celebrate your love, celebrate your new life together and do it the way that best suits you. The heck with your sister's pettiness and trying to impose old fashioned rules. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to attend.  NTA", "....I hope I am wrong, but OP by chance are you the middle child?", "NTA. If your bridal party is planning a shower, you can just leave your family off the guest list and focus on friends and/or his family. \n\nDecline a shower from your side of the family and avoid the drama. Tell her you'll see her at the wedding unless she decides to get herself uninvited from that too.", "NTA. Sister probably volunteered so she'd have the chance to bully you and is now mad you ruined her plan", "NTA, it sounds like your sister just wants to make other people miserable and can\u2019t be happy for other people", "NTA\n\n\"Assigned\"? By whom? The rest of your family? Because it doesn't sound like anyone asked you.\n\nYour family should not be on the invite list if they're still toxic people, OP.", "INFO: she was \"assigned\" by *whom*? Idk if I'd even keep these people around, honestly. NTA", "Somebody is well Jell", "Tell her you neither wish for nor expect gifts, your only desire is for a happy wedding and successful marriage, and if she\u2019s uncomfortable with you having a second wedding she is under no obligation to attend or participate in any way. The wedding is not for her and has nothing to do with her.\n\nIf you are so inclined you may certainly include on your invitations that the only gift you wish for is the pleasure of seeing the invitees. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary but I have seen it.", "What is this \u201ctradition\u201d of not getting gifts for a 2nd marriage? I\u2019m calling bs on that", "NTA not sure what your sisters issue is perhaps she\u2019s just toxic herself but maybe it\u2019s time to step back from her", "NTA\n\nPlease do not let your sister be involved in any of this whatsoever. She\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t take this seriously because you\u2019ve been married before. You know she will bring this up any chance she gets and that will ruin things.\n\nWear white, wear whatever the fuck you want. It\u2019s your wedding not hers. If she can\u2019t respect that or you, don\u2019t invite her.", "NTA.  Every time I talked to her about this wedding, I'd make sure to mention it's my second wedding, and every time she mentioned it was my second wedding,  I'd reply, \"I know. I was there for my first wedding.\" And definitely remind her that \"I didn't assign you in charge of my shower, so you don't have to keep pretending you are.\"", "Honestly, I\u2019d tell her either she never says another word about this being her second wedding and what she should it shouldn\u2019t do as a result or she\u2019ll be summarily uninvited - including comments made during the active wedding. \n\nShe\u2019s welcome to keep any traditions she cares about and believes for her life events, but either stress there to celebrate OPs wedding, or she\u2019s not coming to said wedding. End of. \n\nNTA. I hope you find the courage to put your foot down or step shit over your whole day.", "omg thank you this is the best answer lol", "And keep repeating that!  \u201cOk, mother is going to go grab the flowers, Joe, you be sure to check on the grooms ties\u2026and of course, you sis your assignment is to STFU.\u201d", "Anyone who refers to their preferred practice, especially in relation to weddings, as \"THE tradition\" needs to GTFO.

Either that or there are one of two further scenarios. 1. She got married and it was expensive and fantastical. Or, 2. She got married and it was the exact opposite of that.\n\nEither way, you sister is worried about being outdone. About you having a better wedding than her when she considers that you don\u2019t \u2018deserve\u2019 it.\n\nScrew her. She gets zero say. Throw whatever you want and if she keeps going on tell her she\u2019s not invited.", "I love it more people need this. Assignment", "I am assuming it would be my siblings feeling obligated but no one wanting to do it. But then getting upset when I said no.", "Sounds like she\u2019d show up in white because she\u2019d \u201cassume\u201d a second time bride wouldn\u2019t be wearing white.", "Sadly, you are correct. I do not have a relationship with most of my family. The only family I have contact with is two of my sisters.

It would just start even more drama I don't want to deal with.", "Yep. The black sheep of the family is getting positive attention, how dare she. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, and I hope your in-laws are the family you deserve, in the greatest way. NTA", "I was going to say, isn't that the literal meaning of a shower to *shower* the person with gifts?", "She has been married over 20 years. From my pov it appears they have a great relationship.  I'm really not sure what she would be jealous of.", "Tell her plain and simple- thank you, but no thank you for your help. Tell her you, your fiancee, and wedding party have it covered. \n\nYour siblings feel obligated? You are not obligated to accept help for something you didn't ask help for in the first place.", "She (and maybe your other siblings) needs to hear a more direct and firm message. This wedding is for your husband and his family. You are not asking her opinion on what\u2019s customary for a second wedding. She and your siblings aren\u2019t obligated to bring gifts but if they spoil it for your husband who deserves a lovely wedding, you\u2019ll kick them out. And if they can\u2019t control their opinions now, you\u2019ll take that as a sign that they won\u2019t be able to act like adults for the wedding and they will be uninvited.

So, ignore her.\n\nBut also, tell the wedding party that if sister takes it upon herself to direct them, they should check with you before doing anything. And make sure vendors have passwords, etc. Usual wedding security measures ;-)", "In this case, the rule in some circles that Immediate Family Members Do Not Throw Showers can actually work to your advantage - tell her that some of your guests might consider it gauche if any of your siblings hosted the shower, and that they\u2019re all released from this expectation in order to make sure no one is offended. Your friends will take care of it, and they can relax.", "I understand why it may feel like you are the issue, but it is more likely that they are all still interacting in toxic ways that you have been able to overcome.   Have you explored these issues in therapy?  \n\nIf I were guessing your sister's motivations, I would guess that she is jealous of your relationship success and trying to pull you down or destabilize you.", "Have you ever heard the saying \u201ccrabs in a bucket\u201d.

Cut the assholes out and go be joyous with your beloved.", "In families like yours, no relationship is uncomplicated. \n\nYour siblings are not free of the psychological damage that your parents\u2019 instability inflicted on you. There may be hurt on both sides, hard to say, but you are certainly not the *only* issue, if you\u2019re the issue at all. Your childhoods just caused a lot of big, hard feelings, and since your parents weren\u2019t really available, there was nowhere for those feelings to come out, except at the other people growing up in the same family. You were all trapped in the dysfunction with no one but each other. That doesn\u2019t make for close or easy sibling bonds.", "You are not the issue, they are.\n\nYou were given up, they stayed and were raised in that toxic dysfunctional home so they don\u2019t know what heathy or normal are, you might not either. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to have boundaries and family isn\u2019t only blood.", "Unleash the child. \n\nNTA.", "#teamoldestkid", "As the eldest of a mom who's been through a lot because of her toxic family, PLEASE let your child do it.

Obviously thinking has changed over time but that's where it's coming from.\n\nSame deal being why it was considered declasse for the bride (or her family!) to host a shower - it was seen as a gift-grab.
