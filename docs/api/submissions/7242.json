Also throwaway.\n\nLong story short: I moved to another country when I was 20 to start a new job. I met Annie (F40) at work who was from the same country as me, and we bonded over that. Someone that spoke the same language as me. She had two sons Mike (m16) and Oliver (m10) with her husband from this country. We used to hang out every week outside of work, and we became close friends.\n\n2 years later, Annie and her husband got hit by a drunk driver. Husband died on impact, Annie survived long enough to say goodbye to her sons and me. During this she asked if I could take in Oliver, as Mike was then 18 and in university. I said yes, and papers were signed. Husband wasn't in contact with his parents and didn't have any siblings, and Annie didn't want Oliver to move back to home country, split the siblings and lose his friends. \n\nOn to now. Oliver (18) still lives with me, and after some years in therapy he's a well behaved teenager. In the beginning he called me by my name, and to teacher I was adoptive mom (so they knew my role). In the beginning when I talked about him I used to always call him by his name, because I felt it was both rude to say adopted son or son. As he was either not apart of the family or I was erasing his parents. When he was 14 he accidentally called me mom, and I just replied like it was normal, and after that I was known as mom or mom *first name*. I now call him son \n\nSo the problem: I started a new job a few months ago, I talked about my son to a coworker, and about him starting uni and she was shocked, like most people are. But instead of asking or letting me explain, she went in to a rant about how big of an asshole I am for calling my adoptive son, my son, and making people belive I'm actually a mother. That I'm removing the mom that gave birth to him, and she the only one that should be mom. I was shocked and tried to explain like I did in this post, but she wasn't having it. She has now talked negatively about me to my other coworkers.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1673624168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10axg2d/aita_for_calling_my_adopted_son_just_my_son/", "score": 604, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

G, from the get go treated me better than my mom did. He gave me respect and communicated with me like a person, not a child, and I loved him. He was there for my teenage years, coming to my plays, taking me out for food after school, going to amusement parks, going to Blockbuster every Tuesday, things no one else in my family did for me.
