Unfortunately, her jerk of a husband is divorcing her and our mom is caring for our dad after he had his second heart related surgery. Beth was crying to me one night on the phone about how alone she feels after her best friend had to back out of being in the delivery room due to a family emergency and our sister couldn't get the time off of work from her job overseas.\n\nBeth said that her doctor told her that they may have to do a C-section and she was panicking. I let her cry about it for nearly an hour and then Big Brother mode kicked in and I offered to fly out and support her. It was something I did without any real thought but I meant it because this was my baby sister and she was going through a rough time and told me she was scared. I have the type of job where I can get permission to work from home and since I'm well liked and respected in the office, my boss was willing to let me do this provided that my work performance isn't impacted.\n\nMy sister sounded so relieved when I told her the good news and everyone in the family was giving me the preverbal pat on the back. The only one who wasn't happy was my wife \"Kim\" (37f) who told me that I needed to stay here for the kids and that Beth can either find someone else or do it alone. My kids \"Cody\" (13m), \"Chelsea\" (10f), \"Connor\" (7m) all know that their aunt is going through a tough time and needs help and said that they were fine with me leaving for a while.\n\nKim insisted that the kids were lying and didn't want me to go and I said that even if it was true, I was still going because Beth needed me and that I would make it up to the kids later. This caused a fight between us and in the heat of the moment Kim admitted that she didn't want me to go because she thought that it was weird for an uncle to be present at the birth. This brought up old wounds for me since I was denied access to the birthing room for all three of my children as Kim only wanted her mom and sister there. In truth, Beth's baby will be the first and possibly only time I'll ever get to see a baby be born live and Kim doesn't like it.\n\nI snapped back with the aforementioned births of my children and said that if Kim didn't want me to go so bad then she can call Beth, my parents, and my sister and explain it all to them because there was no way I was going to break Beth's heart when she needed family most. Kim is now saying that I'm TA am I?\n\nEdit to add: Here is some additional information since people are starting to ask\n\n1. I don't know all the details yet but Beth told me that a C-section is a strong possibility.\n2. I believe the average recovery rate for a C-section is about a month so I am prepared to stay that long to help my sister out but hopefully my mom or other sister can take over two weeks post birth.\n3. As previously stated I got permission to work remotely and I have a lot of PTO saved up so there will be no loss of money.\n4. My flight is two weeks from now and I paid for the ticket(s) out of my own personal checking account.\n5. Beth STBX convinced her to move to the opposite coast so she doesn't have anyone she's close to that can help her out.\n6. All of my children are over the age of 5 and don't have any special needs.\n7. No Beth's STBX will not offer any type of support that isn't court mandated because six months into the pregnancy he decided he was child free and is angry that Beth wouldn't agree to adoption.\n\nEdit 2: Beth does want to move back and we (my parents, other sister, and me) are going to help her after she healed up enough from the birth.

Your sister need someone for support and I think it's a great idea for you to be there for her.", "INFO: how long are you going to be gone? Is your sister having a c section or something where she already knows what day you need to fly in?", "NTA - Giving birth is one of the most vulnerable and painful experiences someone can be in. She will need someone there to be her advocate in the event she\u2019s unable to advocate for herself. Absolutely good on you for stepping up.\n\nIt\u2019s strange that your wife\u2019s hangup seems to be an uncle being present in the delivery room\u2026? When she had no problem having a grandma and *aunt* in her delivery room? While *not letting you be present for the births of your own children?* \n\nShe has no legitimately reasons and it honestly sounds like she has some issues that are her responsibility to work out.", "N T A. Your wife thinking that it is weird for an uncle to be present for the birth of their niece/nephew is not reason enough for your sister to go through this experience alone. Your sister has already had so many people revoke their offers of support, to have you do so would cause a lot of unnecessary stress. \n\nI say this every time, but it is always better to discuss it with your partner before making a decision. It doesn't mean that you have to abide by your partner's preference, but it is important for your partner to feel included in the decision making process. You're a team. Not two soloists. \n\nHowever, there are times when that just isn't possible. I can understand how, given the nature of your call with your sister, you made a decision without your wife. \n\nWishing your sister and the baby the best of luck!\n\nETA: YTA OP. A month. You are leaving for a month and failed to check with your wife first. Convenient that you left that out of your original post, almost like you knew the verdict would have been completely different if you were honest. Do better.", "NTA, this isn't about the kids, it seems to be about your wife's belief that men should not be in the delivery room.  You are a great big brother, stepping in when all other options were exhausted, and I'm sure your sister will be forever grateful and you'll have a special moment with your niece or nephew.  My only caveat is how long are you going to be gone?  Will that put a hardship on your wife and kids?  Could you go just for the birth and a short time after and then maybe her best friend or someone else could take a turn?", "ESH\n\nNot for being their for the birth, I think that's lovely to support your sister.\n\nBut leaving your wife with three children for the minium of a 2 weeks, most likely a month, without her agreemenf is unreasonable. Putting the pressure on your 13 year old in your absence is unacceptable. He is a child and those children are your responsibility, not his. \n\nWhilst your wife's reasons for not being with your sister at the birth are so very strange and frankly unhealthy, you are literally dumping all parental & household responsibility on your wife for a extended period of time. This is going to impact your marriage and your children if you don't rethink your approach. You have gotten the children's approval to leave, but not your wife approval to be the sole parent for a month, that's so wrong.", "I am having trouble deciding on a judgment.  I think your reasoning is solid, but you should have talked to your wife before making the commitment.  Her reason for disagreeing is absurd, but it\u2019s also absurd to peace out and leave your wife on her own with three kids for a month.  1-2 weeks is more reasonable IMO.", "NTA, it sounds like your wife has some weird trust issues with you. Does she treat you with suspicion in other ways, too?", "NTA\n\nSounds like Kim believes one or multiple of the following\n1.\tShe has issues with men being in the birthing room. \n2.\tShe now realizes that you\u2019ll get to be their for your sister when she denied the same for your own children. Leading to some weird jealousy. \n3.\tShe otherwise hates your sister. \n\n\nI think she\u2019s wrong on both counts. It\u2019s perfectly fine for a partner or loved male to be in the birthing room. She had the right to deny it for her own, but she doesn\u2019t have the right to deny it for your sister.  \n\nWhen I was there for my own wife, I spent most of the time \u201cnorth of the equator.\u201d  My job was to help my wife. My MIL was there the whole time. My FIL was there for part of the time and stepped out. My parents visited early and left. My brother camped out in the waiting room the whole damn night, just in case.  (I didn\u2019t know, only realized the next morning.  Damn, tearing up even now.) \n\nLook. Be there for your sister. Be the big brother and help her out with whatever she needs. You have your kids\u2019 support.  I don\u2019t know what to tell you about Kim\u2019s issue.\n\nEdit: is Kim from a culture where men don\u2019t attend the birth? She\u2019d still be wrong, but it would help explain her hangup.", "NTA and she needs some one there, birth is a really dangerous time for mothers and she needs some one there if something goes wrong to look out for her and her child. You are a really amazing brother for stepping up, and I recommend taking some time to research ways to support her, especially if she ends up having a c section, because recovery is no joke.", "NTA- clearly this is triggering something unresolved with your wife about you being present for the delivery of your children. I wonder if she regrets it now but realizes that she can't fix it and is jealous of the fact that you will experience it with someone else.  I don't know. but whatever, that's her deal. \n\nI'd say this- Honey- I get that this is some complex shit for you. But this isn't about you. My sister needs help. You understand being particular about who is in the room as you certainly were. We can all be assured that I was not her first, second, or even third choice. But she is so anxious about being alone.  You didn't want to be alone, did you?  So you should understand this.  But beyond all that- I told her I would do it. So I'm doing it. I will not be made a liar. You have articulated no reason beyond not wanting me to be there. Well, we don't do that to each other. Perhaps the next time your mother needs something, I should decide that I prefer you not to go, surely you'd honor that.  Yeah, we're not setting that precedent.", "I can understand your wife being upset because you didn\u2019t discuss any of this with her.  You just looked at her and said I am going. I\u2019ll be gone for a month. I am leaving you with 3 kids which is a lot of work. She probably feels your putting your sister over her and your children. I think you should have spoken to her before just saying your going. Your suppose to be a team. \n\nI understand your sister is by herself. I understand that she is scared. And she needs support. So I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to help. \n\n\nBut leaving your wife with 3 boys for a month is a lot. I can see where she does feel like you are abandoning her and your kids for your sister.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife has issues.", "A month is a long time to leave to leave your wife alone with three children. Especially as you did not discuss this first! \n\nBut your wife is also hypocritical in having her sister (an aunt) at the births, whilst suggesting its inappropriate for you to be there as an uncle.\nThe children may indeed be hesitant and privately upset about you leaving, they are still so young and again, a month is a long time to be away. \n\nI think you should discuss more with your wife, and consider staying for a shorter period. You mentioned your mom and older sister possibly being able to help out after a couple weeks. Do you have any other family members available? Cousins who your sister knows well? Is it possible to coordinate care with a wider net of people?", "YTA for planning to stay away from your family for a month. NTA for being there for your sister during the birth.  Sounds like your wife may be feeling bad about you witnessing the birth of a niece or nephew when she wouldn\u2019t allow you to witness the birth of your own children.", "ESH but you should float the idea of moving your sister back across the country so she has a more ready support system.", "What wife doesn't allow her husband in the delivery room but has her mom and sister. This sounds like a control thing with her. Go be by your sister's side and tell your wife she made her choices so you can make yours!", "INFO: sooooo, can you guys even afford it, also how long would you be gone. Also does your sister even want you in the room when it happens\n\nOP is leaving his kids for a month YTA", "YTA. A month is too long to unilaterally decide to leave your wife ha fling three kids and the house alone. You\u2019ll be lucky if your keys work when you get back. \n\nBeth doesn\u2019t need someone to stay with her for a month. Source: my own experience as a single mother who had a c-section. I had people come over to help, but no one stayed with us.", "NTA, she has literally birthed 3 kids herself and she was lucky enough to have people there for her while she did it so she must know how much support/just having someone there that you love can go a long way. She should have no reason to be mad at you for just wanting to help your sister out in a stressful and lonely time. So yea nta.", "I am so sorry you weren't there for the birth of your children. If she had her sister there, or her children's aunty, then why can you be there for your niece or nephew?

She shouldn't be on her own if she is scared and you sound like a fantastic brother :)", "i wish someone would tell me i couldnt show up for my little brothers in whatever capacity they needed me. i wish someone would. They would get exactly one opportunity to correct that decision before they were forcefully nad permanently removed from my life. \n\nSeriously, what lessons is your wife teaching your children rn?? That thwy shouldnt be there for each other thru whatever? Cos thats all im seeing. Would she want your sons to abandon your daughter were she in a similar situation?? Thats terrifying. \n\nim quick to remote people even for just being slightly annoying but this is imo a huge sign of shit nobody needs in their life. \n\nNTA dont let her being....whatever that is from being there for your little sister. Wishing mum and baby health and happiness!!", "NTA. You're being a good big bro. Kim has a strange idea about men not being appropriate in the delivery room, but that is a her issue, not your issue. The kids understand why you would want to go help, and seem to be empathetic. Good job.", "YTA a month is too long to just up and leave your wife with three kids and no notice. \n\nA day? Sure thing. A week? It's not ideal, but understandable. 2 weeks? If there are super extenuating circumstances and there's no conflicting schedule issues.. maybe. \nA month? Surely your wife didn't deprive you of the whole first month of being a dad with all three of your kids.", "YTA.  You volunteered to leave your wife at home alone for a month+ with no support without consulting her.", "Ab. So. Lute. Ly. NTA! My brother and I are close even though we have many years between us like you and your sister. I think it\u2019s amazing you can be and want to be there to support her. And I\u2019m sorry that your wife can\u2019t see just how wonderful that truly is.", "NTA. I think you're doing the right thing. If I were you, I would recommend talking to your wife more after the two of you have cooled off to try and see if there's some deeper issue. If it doesn't cause any harm to your household, aside from your wife finding it weird, then I think you should go.", "NTA go be there for your sister. Thats what family does for each other always. To bad your wife doesn't understand that. I'm sorry you missed out on the birth of your children. I think its insane you weren't aloud in.", "YTA. For a MONTH?!?!!", "NTA \n\nGo support Beth! \n\nYour wife is TA here and acting jealous unfortunately. I think there are more issues at play OP. \n\nYou and your wife need a good sit down. WHY doesn\u2019t she like the fact that you will see your nephew/niece being born? Is she regretting the fact that she never gave you that chance and that you missed your own children\u2019s birth? Is she worried about the special bond you will have Beth and your niece/nephew? \n\nLoving your niece or nephew doesn\u2019t take away from loving your children. Being there for your sister like her mom was there for you irks your wife\u2026 it should not. Your wife has some issues to overcome. Your sister appreciates your support in a way your wife didn\u2019t. Your wife has to accept that and let go.

Do they go to school and take the bus or walk? Will she have some help? Will you be gone a long time? As long as all is manageable, you helping your sister in need shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Your wife would be helping too by running the home for a bit. Can they all visit after to meet the baby? \n\nLots of things to ponder and to discuss as your wife is possibly letting the past interfere with the present, and Beth\u2019s need for support. \n\nGood luck OP! I hope Beth\u2019s birth giving experience goes well. You are an amazing big brother!", "NTA, support your sister. My husband does TDYs frequently. A month is nothing. Most of my friends and I look at them as a nice vacation where we can watch all the shows we want and sleep in the middle of the bed. \nI don't get why everyone is so weird about how long it is...", "NTA I could never even begin to comprehend forcing my husband to stay home out of pure spite instead of helping his little sister who has just had a major surgery and now has to care for a newborn and if I were you I would want to do the same. I love my family dearly and I refuse to act like they're just unimportant placeholders once I get married.\n\n\n30 days is barely anything when you already have a routine and a set day to day life but those 30 days would change a lot of things for the better for your sister. They pass quickly and your sister's postpartum brain chemicals definitely will be dependent on what happens to her in the beginning. You might literally save her from postpartum depression just by being there for a few weeks.", "I'm gonna go NTA but I'd like to hear your wife's side.\n\nShould you have asked your wife first? Yes. Should you have discussed how long with her first? Yes. But you're concerned about your sister who's already going through a ton of crap and all alone. I'd give you leeway for that. It's not like you're going on a vacation.\n\nYour wife's reasoning sucks. She doesn't get to say what your kids think, they do. Men can absolutely be the room where children are birthed. It happens all the time. It happens with men who aren't the father. You can be at your sister's head and never see anything a sibling shouldn't see. And while I do think the mother has the final say on who's in the room with her when she has kids, it really sucks she wouldn't let you be a part of the birth of your children. That's just really odd to me.\n\nAdditional info I'd like to know is how is you not being home going to affect your household, besides the typical you're not there to help with kids outside of working hours? Does your wife work? Will you need a babysitter or daycare for the time you're gone? Or does your wife stay home with the kids and take care of the household? If it's going to cause financial strain (which I doubt considering everything you've said), then it skates you closer to the AH side. But if it's just that she'll be alone with the kids, who should be mostly self-sufficient by those ages, then it sounds like she's being at least a little selfish to me. Any parent, in a normal situation like this one, should be able to go a month without their spouse home, especially when they're helping a family member in dire circumstances.", "NTA. Maybe you can suggest that your wife has her mom or sister stay with her and the kids while you go support your sis.", "ESH. There needs to be a compromise. \n\nWanting to be there to support your sister during her delivery and for a short time right after the baby is born is fine, and your wife\u2019s stance on you being in the delivery room with your sister is weird and sexist. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not okay to unilaterally decide to leave for anywhere from two weeks to a month and leave your wife alone with your three kids. Those are your kids too, it\u2019s not fair to just decide you don\u2019t have to be responsible for them for a month.", "YTA for not saying you plan to be gone for an entire MONTH in your original post.  Go for a week, two weeks, probably reasonable, but leaving your wife alone with 3 kids for a month is extreme.", "You're NTA. Why does your wife think it's weird for an uncle to be present at the birth of his niece/nephew,  but it's okay for an aunt to be there for the births all three of her sister's children? \n\nEdit- removed suggestion wife may be jealous of OP's relationship with his sister after seeing he plans to be gone for a month. I can see where she may feel that is excessive time, but still don't think he is the A-H here.", "NTA and you know it", "YTA u leaving your family for a month? Yeah, you definitely tried to spin this to make your wife look a certain way. You are leaving for a month your wife and children and didn\u2019t even discuss it with her. You just voluntold her to be the sole caregiver. \n\nThat is different than the birth. Your entire post is about a birth, not afterwards. Planned csection is a day, providing aftercare is another thing, that you should have discussed prior to just leaving. She\u2019s your wife, you shouldn\u2019t make unilateral decisions that take you weeks/months away from the family.", "NTA - what is your wife's problem?", "NTA. I'm sorry your wife is not being supportive of her SILs needs. Not only are you an Awesome big brother for this, you are an Awesome dad setting an example of sibling relationships for your kids.  \n\n(Not sure your finances, and obviously none of my business, but maybe hiring a housekeeper for one or two days while you are gone to help your wife keep up with everything would help smooth things over?)", "NTA you definitely deserve a pat on the back. Your sister needs family support and you are able to do it. Good for you! Your wife seems to have some hangups about you/men being in the delivery room. The fact she denied you the joy of seeing your own children being born is such a shame! Go to your sister and strengthen your family bonds. You will have a forever bond with the new life she is bringing into the world.", "NTA, but your wife sure is. She doesn\u2019t want you present at the birth, that\u2019s all there is to it. She denied you being present for your own children which is cruel, and now she has to live with that decision. Be there for your sister and let your wife be pissed at herself.

You should have run after the first one but too late for that now.", "NTA for wanting to go help your sister through this major life change. A little bit TA for not consulting with your wife about how long you would be gone, although I can understand how in the moment it is easy to make a rash emotional decision (been there myself).

That would be a big help without putting a burden on your wife to manage everything at home while you are gone.", "YTA for not speaking to your wife about it before making the decision. And for agreeing to be gone a minimum of two weeks and up to a month without discussing it with your wife or even leaving her with a plan for assistance during that time. It's nice that your kids are fine with you being gone but you don't seem to care if your wife has back-up while you are gone. \n\nThe lack of communication is the main issue here, not whether or not you are going. The timeframe you are going for makes the lack of communication a bigger issue.", "Yes, YTA. While it's admirable that you want to support your sister during a difficult time, your wife's concerns and feelings are also valid. She has a right to express her discomfort with the idea of you being present at the birth of your sister's child, and it's not fair for you to dismiss her concerns and prioritize your own desires over her feelings. Additionally, you made a commitment to your wife and children, and it's not fair to break that commitment without discussing it with them first and finding a solution that works for everyone. It's important to communicate and compromise in relationships, and it doesn't seem like you've done that in this situation.", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds like a JEALOUS woman.

Unfortunately, her jerk of a husband is divorcing her and our mom is caring for our dad after he had his second heart related surgery. Beth was crying to me one night on the phone about how alone she feels after her best friend had to back out of being in the delivery room due to a family emergency and our sister couldn't get the time off of work from her job overseas. \n\nBeth said that her doctor told her that they may have to do a C-section and she was panicking. I let her cry about it for nearly an hour and then Big Brother mode kicked in and I offered to fly out and support her. It was something I did without any real thought but I meant it because this was my baby sister and she was going through a rough time and told me she was scared. I have the type of job where I can get permission to work from home and since I'm well liked and respected in the office, my boss was willing to let me do this provided that my work performance isn't impacted.\n\nMy sister sounded so relieved when I told her the good news and everyone in the family was giving me the preverbal pat on the back. The only one who wasn't happy was my wife \"Kim\" (37f) who told me that I needed to stay here for the kids and that Beth can either find someone else or do it alone. My kids \"Cody\" (13m), \"Chelsea\" (10f), \"Connor\" (7m) all know that their aunt is going through a tough time and needs help and said that they were fine with me leaving for a while. \n\nKim insisted that the kids were lying and didn't want me to go and I said that even if it was true, I was still going because Beth needed me and that I would make it up to the kids later. This caused a fight between us and in the heat of the moment Kim admitted that she didn't want me to go because she thought that it was weird for an uncle to be present at the birth. This brought up old wounds for me since I was denied access to the birthing room for all three of my children as Kim only wanted her mom and sister there. In truth, Beth's baby will be the first and possibly only time I'll ever get to see a baby be born live and Kim doesn't like it. \n\nI snapped back with the aforementioned births of my children and said that if Kim didn't want me to go so bad then she can call Beth, my parents, and my sister and explain it all to them because there was no way I was going to break Beth's heart when she needed family most.
