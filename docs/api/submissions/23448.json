It really does make it feel so much worse. Instead of going to comfort your child, you're furiously shaking the happily snoring person next to you. By that point you're wide awake, the other person is still asleep, you're super frustrated and jealous of their ability to sleep, and your baby is still crying, so you go to help them. It's a frustrating process that rarely actually helps you get more sleep.", "INFO: so nothing short of a bear attack wakes up up\u2026but her turning the lights on also does? Which is true?

Trying to wake you up at night could be so frustrating that it makes it difficult for her to go back  to sleep quickly.", "YTA. Your solution is just more work for her. That's why she's mad.  It's on you to get yourself sorted. Plenty of people sleep like the dead (I'm one), but when your baby is screaming you get up. Your wife has always been there so you've not had to. Make yourself.

YTA", "I\u2019d say NAH because you can\u2019t help being a heavy sleeper, but it\u2019s understandable for her to be upset because waking you up just gives her more work. Can you take on more of the nighttime and morning duties to make up for it? Can you put a baby monitor inches from your ear? You need to look for a solution or compromise, because making your wife wake you up constantly is not a fair solution.", "Yta, it's on you to find ways to balance this parenting gap instead of placing even more on Mom's already overloaded plate", "As a parent of a young baby YTA. Not because you are a heavy sleeper - but because her having to wake you up to tend to the baby defeats the purpose of you being on duty.\n\nWhat\u2019s hard about multiple night wakings is 3 things: 1) the anticipation that you would be woken up multiple times; 2) tending to the baby; 3) trying to fall back asleep again before the next wake.\n\nHer having to wake you up arguably means she\u2019s also experiencing 1) & 3).

Why does your wife have to hold herself responsible for a child who is also your obligation? \n\nThere are accommodations for people who are deaf to be able to get out of the house in the case of a fire or even respond to their babies when they can\u2019t hear. Maybe you need one of those? A vibrating alarm on your phone? \n\nIf you know you can\u2019t wake up, have you considered taking the baby for the first half of the night and then sleeping the second half? \n\nYour child is your responsibility.

She's tired. I know what it's like to have to do everything myself, but it's for a different reason. I don't resent it, but gods do I get tired of it. She might not be thinking reasonably about it at this point if she's as sleep deprived as she sounds.\n\nIt isn't your fault you sleep that heavily, or that lights wake you up but sound does not. Sound doesn't wake me up either - even babies crying. I did that stupid \"take home a crying baby doll to take care of\" program for health class and failed it because I did not wake up at 2AM (in high school, mind you, age 14) to shut the baby off when it cried. Turning my bedroom light on or shutting my fan off will wake me up though.\n\nThe compromise here is that you need to find a way to wake up when the baby wakes up, and not make your wife have to wake up and then spend the effort of also trying to wake you up. At that point she's awake anyway. Do a quick Google search, look for baby monitors that would be able to wake you up and keep it by your head. She might still wake up, but she can quickly go back to sleep if she doesn't have to spend the effort of getting you out of bed to go fuss with the baby.\n\nYWBTA if you just let the situation go because she doesn't want to wake you up.

Mother's instinct? Not his fault, either way. I woke him up when I felt like I needed it, whether because I needed an extra hand or if one of them was just having an extra rough night waking up every hour and I was too tired to get up every time. My husband genuinely felt had because he'd have helped more often, but he just didn't hear them cry, so he's only knew about it if I woke him. It was not a big deal. He was absolutely willing to help. It sounds like you are too. You can't magically control how you sleep. I don't see why she can't just shake you awake real quick so she can go back to bed. She sounds like the AH, and I say that as a mother.", "YTA -  this is 100% weaponised incompetence.

It\u2019s not weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s just the way you are (but could ask your Mr Sandman to sprinkle some of his magic on me?). Weaponized incompetence would be if you botched every diaper change so she felt forced to do it herself to get it right. On the flip side, she may get that feeling because once she\u2019s awake, she feels she might as well do it herself (which is a very similar feeling\u2026 i.e., \u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d). \n\nThat being said, your wife is likely exhausted and frustrated.

The only way I can get any sleep is to be medicated, so pretty much all night time stuff falls on her. She can wake me up in an emergency,  but it takes serious effort.  The few times she's gone over night by her self somewhere I simply have to live off the 2 or so hours a night I can get naturally. It sucks but it is doable", "She is usually walking around, getting changes of clothes, and stuff like that so it\u2019s not just the light it\u2019s the general commotion. By the time I get up my wife is basically done with everything that needs to be done, so I sleep through almost all of it.", "He\u2019s the asshole because he\u2019s a heavy sleeper?\n\nLike at what point here does he have the ability to make a choice?", "Then she can\u2019t complain about him not helping at night.

If it\u2019s easier for her to just help with the baby than that\u2019s ok too.", "It's not weaponised incompetence, he literally is a heavy sleeper. I'm the same, you physically have to move me to wake me up.", "I set an alarm on my watch, which is a fair point.

OP said he feel bad about it so his conscience is attempting to pay attention but he has no control over his subconscious. If subconscious says it\u2019s sleep time then there\u2019s nothing he can do aside from ask her to wake him up so she can go back to sleep.", "My wife breastfeeds so I can\u2019t do anything, really. The only thing he wants to do at night is breastfeed and that\u2019s not my wheelhouse. Someone else suggested taking turns or having a shift which may work.", "Agreed. As the mother, I could barely fall asleep when mine were babies. Even if I did, it was like I was in tune with hearing them breathe, cry, whimper, anything. I guess women are wired for this, hormones or whatever- but he needs to find a way. Less white noise in the room,  baby monitor under the pillow, or the multiple other suggestions listed here.", "That's ridiculous, what's he supposed to do?

Exactly this.", "No not exactly, my partner doesn't wake up from a shake. He doesn't wake up after having a conversation with me in his sleep. It's fucking painful having to wake him up for help at night. We haven't really found a solution to this either. That said, he can't help it.

Besides, he is a grown ass man and there are many ways he can wake himself if he would do a simple Google search. That is what makes this weaponized incompetence. The existence of obvious solutions that he can't be bothered to research, and would rather his wife rouse herself enough to rouse his Rip Van Winkle ass, and then try to go back to sleep.

What time exactly? \n\nThe only reasonable suggestion is the vibrating baby monitor for deaf parents\u2026 that\u2019s actually pretty clever. \n\nOP, you are NTA\u2026. Provided you\u2019re truly willing to take up half the time and take care of the baby. Your wife should be shaking you up to do it.

I didn\u2019t know that!!  Pretty cool", "Babies don\u2019t fall instantly back to sleep.

People are saying he is an asshole for not waking up, lol like he is voluntarily chosing not to wake up.", "He\u2019s an asshole because he\u2019s an done nothing to solve the problem apart from put it on her.

My husband also struggled to wake up to the baby crying. Know what he did?

Instead of Mom waking up and taking care of the baby the husband wants her to wake up and put All her (non-existent) energy into waking him out of a deep sleep.
