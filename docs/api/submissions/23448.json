It really does make it feel so much worse. Instead of going to comfort your child, you're furiously shaking the happily snoring person next to you. By that point you're wide awake, the other person is still asleep, you're super frustrated and jealous of their ability to sleep, and your baby is still crying, so you go to help them. It's a frustrating process that rarely actually helps you get more sleep.", "INFO: so nothing short of a bear attack wakes up up\u2026but her turning the lights on also does? Which is true?

Trying to wake you up at night could be so frustrating that it makes it difficult for her to go back  to sleep quickly.", "YTA. Your solution is just more work for her. That's why she's mad.  It's on you to get yourself sorted. Plenty of people sleep like the dead (I'm one), but when your baby is screaming you get up. Your wife has always been there so you've not had to. Make yourself.

Why does your wife have to hold herself responsible for a child who is also your obligation? \n\nThere are accommodations for people who are deaf to be able to get out of the house in the case of a fire or even respond to their babies when they can\u2019t hear. Maybe you need one of those? A vibrating alarm on your phone? \n\nIf you know you can\u2019t wake up, have you considered taking the baby for the first half of the night and then sleeping the second half? \n\nYour child is your responsibility.

She's tired. I know what it's like to have to do everything myself, but it's for a different reason. I don't resent it, but gods do I get tired of it. She might not be thinking reasonably about it at this point if she's as sleep deprived as she sounds.\n\nIt isn't your fault you sleep that heavily, or that lights wake you up but sound does not. Sound doesn't wake me up either - even babies crying. I did that stupid \"take home a crying baby doll to take care of\" program for health class and failed it because I did not wake up at 2AM (in high school, mind you, age 14) to shut the baby off when it cried. Turning my bedroom light on or shutting my fan off will wake me up though.\n\nThe compromise here is that you need to find a way to wake up when the baby wakes up, and not make your wife have to wake up and then spend the effort of also trying to wake you up. At that point she's awake anyway. Do a quick Google search, look for baby monitors that would be able to wake you up and keep it by your head. She might still wake up, but she can quickly go back to sleep if she doesn't have to spend the effort of getting you out of bed to go fuss with the baby.\n\nYWBTA if you just let the situation go because she doesn't want to wake you up.

Mother's instinct? Not his fault, either way. I woke him up when I felt like I needed it, whether because I needed an extra hand or if one of them was just having an extra rough night waking up every hour and I was too tired to get up every time. My husband genuinely felt had because he'd have helped more often, but he just didn't hear them cry, so he's only knew about it if I woke him. It was not a big deal. He was absolutely willing to help. It sounds like you are too. You can't magically control how you sleep. I don't see why she can't just shake you awake real quick so she can go back to bed. She sounds like the AH, and I say that as a mother.", "YTA -  this is 100% weaponised incompetence.

It\u2019s not weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s just the way you are (but could ask your Mr Sandman to sprinkle some of his magic on me?). Weaponized incompetence would be if you botched every diaper change so she felt forced to do it herself to get it right. On the flip side, she may get that feeling because once she\u2019s awake, she feels she might as well do it herself (which is a very similar feeling\u2026 i.e., \u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d). \n\nThat being said, your wife is likely exhausted and frustrated.

She has obviously been bothered enough and for long enough by this to look into these terms.\n\nIn my experience, I didn't even know what \"weaponized incompetence\" or \"the mental load\" was until dealing with my own similar situation; a partner who expected us to both work full time jobs(me actually working more hours than him often times, because I get paid hourly and he is a contractor that gets paid by the job), yet I was expected to take care of all cooking and cleaning while he played video games, watched YouTube, or tinkered in the garage after work.

You need to make every effort (search for solutions you never explored before) so that you have done/are doing your very best to not putt the burden of waking you up on your wife.\n* I think your wife needs to reconsider her perspective on you and on the optimal solution:\n\n1. I read so many posts where a spouse assumes the worst intentions of the other. Does your wife really believe that you (1) are intentionally choosing to not make any effort to wake up/ do not really want to help? and (2) are callously expecting her to wake you up because you really don't care how that makes her feel? Is that really what she thinks of you? Is that your history/ general pattern, or do you generally do a good job of stepping up and being a partner? (If she truly doesn't think too well of you, then maybe you both need to go to counseling to address that.)\n2. Let's talk optimal solutions. The optimal outcome is you find an effective tool to help you wake up that doesn't require her to wake you up or even wake up at all. If that is elusive, what is the next best solution? What if the tool effectively woke you up but was terribly disruptive to her sleep? What if your best efforts don't turn up an effective way to wake you up? Will she be better off if she continues to view this challenging situation as you just choosing to stick her with all the night work? Or can she see that you WANT TO HELP and just accept that you need help to be a help. How could she reframe her perspective so that she gets the most satisfaction she can out of the situation?\n3. (1) Problem-solve. Is it just the noise that you don't wake up to? Or does it also take a lot of physical movement to wake you up. (You mentioned responding to both light and being shaken.) If it's just noise, isn't it worth her taking a moment to shake you awake so that she doesn't have to fully wake up and get out of bed? Or would some form of vibrating alarm or light alarm work well? (2) Are there other things you can do to make up for not being much help at night? Can you wake up early so that she can sleep in? Or take over more of the evening chores so that she can have some downtime to offset the nighttime interruptions?\n4. The baby is not going to need night-time feedings/changings forever. This will end. Even she doesn't feel you can adequately offset her night disturbances, the baby's needs will change and maybe you can be the one to take the hit for the next challenging period you face.\n\nThe key, I think, is that you two need to see each other as a trusted, contributing partner; you need to each be a trusted, contributing partner, and you need to seek the perspectives and the long view that will help you both make it through the challenges together.

That is, consecutive hours of sleep. The reason it\u2019s helpful to have shifts as partners, or to take every other wake up, or something similar is because it means each parent gets a little longer stretch. A 4 week old baby is likely only sleeping for 2-4 hours at a time and they go to bed early. So imagine the baby goes to bed at 7\u2026they\u2019re awake at 10, only probably an hour after the other two kids in the house went to sleep. But now the baby is awake so one of the parents stays awake and feeds, changes, soothes the baby back to sleep. It\u2019s probably about 30 min process. \n\nWithout a partner to take the next wake-up, conservatively, that parent gets to go to sleep at 10:30pm\u2026then is awoken likely between 1:30 and 2:30\u2026same routine, up for 30 min or more. Then again between 4 and 5 am. By the time they do that last wake up, it\u2019s only 1 hour until the older kids wake up. So they\u2019ve had interrupted sleep all night. And likely no more than 2-3 hours at a time. \n\n\nThat same scenario with a partner who helps: \n-mom takes the wake up at 10:00 and gets to bed at 10.30pm \n\n-dad takes the 1:30-230 wake up. This means mom gets to sleep until the next wake up around 4, increasing her consolidated sleeps \n\n-dad gets to sleep through the 4am wake up, meaning he gets a consolidated block from 230-morning time. \n\nYes, one partner could go to the bassinet, pick up the baby, comfort them, shake the other awake, then try to get back to sleep. And many mothers end up having to do that just so they don\u2019t have to do everything themselves. But still, it means not getting consolidated sleep and it\u2019s much harder to fall back asleep. Worth noting it\u2019s also hard to calm down a newborn who has escalated. Letting them get to a point where they\u2019re inconsolable is not ideal in the middle of the night. And with two other kids in the house, I\u2019d be willing to bet the OP\u2019s wife is also trying not to allow the baby to wake up the siblings, etc. \n\nOP-one solution is taking shifts that don\u2019t require you to wake up to the baby\u2019s cry bc you simply stay awake. So you send your wife to bed early, do bedtime with the older kids, and take the newborn shift until 1 or 2am. Just simply stay awake instead of going to sleep.

For women who didn't have so-called \"mom ears\" or other such attributes that are considered to be natural or inherent to being a woman, expressions like that create feelings of inadequacy, shame and like something is wrong with them. It also perpetuates the misconception that men cannot be as good parents as women because they lack some kind of natural instinct that women have. This kind of argumentation is used today to prohibit single men and gay male couples from adopting children in many countries. It's also used to deny fathers equal custody in the case of divorce.\n\nI say misconception because it is just that. It is fslse. The scientific studies done on this matter are very clear. The scientific term for \"Mom ears\" is enlargement of the amygdala, a feature in the brain responsible for perceiving threat awareness. Enlargement of the amygdala can occur when caring for a newborn for an extended period of time. It can occur regardless of the sex of the caretaker. Also regardless of the biological connection of the caretaker to the baby.
