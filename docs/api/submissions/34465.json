Pregnant women are people and can be wrong. Can be unfair or egoistic or self absorbed.

Or, tell her that while you appreciate her doing chores in work time, she can't expect you to do the same and even less on the same day.

As she describes it, hunger literally makes her feel like death, and she is by no means a glutton\u2026but yes, in a logical world snacks should have been able to hold her over, I think moreso she didn\u2019t know that 530 was when I would be able to go and she waited a half hour already so was done waiting", "Except that not eating immediately when hungry during pregnancy CAN lead to horrible nausea.

Especially if it\u2019s a little slow.", "Would it be an option to hire in a cleaning service one day a week?  To help her out, since she's pregnant and seems to be wanting you to run a vacuum while you're on the clock?  Take some of the other stressors off of her?

People like her.", "She is definitely setting him up to fail.  She is doing more of the housework, but that is because she can.  She is not doing more of the overall work that it takes to keep the household afloat because he absolutely works his ass off to keep money coming in and she does not.  This not much different than a stay at home spouse demanding to split household chores evenly with a spouse that has a full time job.  It does not work that way.", "While I agree that her choosing to do chores during the day is just that\u2026her choice, it doesn\u2019t sound like you do very much at all around the house and I think that\u2019s where her frustration is. Especially being pregnant. It\u2019s exhausting and you feel like garbage. \n\nYou need to quit comparing jobs. You both work full-time jobs. Just because she has more downtime doesn\u2019t dismiss that. You need to find a way to split household duties more evenly.", "I'm going to guess the biggest problem is she has to ask you to do it. It's working like this: You both have full time jobs. She has pretty good time management and does household chores around that. Then, you \"help out,\" but is she telling you what to do next? See, that's a problem. You're a grown person and this insinuates that household chores are really still her job and she's simply delegating tasks as \"the boss\" to a generous bystander who is graciously giving out some help in his spare time. \n\nIn reality, you both live there and should be contributing to this as a team effort. In other words, when you have time, and you see that vacuuming needs to be done, you whip out the vacuum unasked and do it. Do you do that? OR do you wait for her to delegate work to you as if you're doing her a favor by \"helping out?\"   \n\n\nThen, there's this thing where you both have full time jobs and you're comparing those jobs and feeling like you work harder. I mean, maybe, but so what? Household chores in the house you both live in should be evenly distributed, not doled out based on your personal assessment, without input from her, that you \"do more at your job.\" Well, really, it could be she has better time management skills, not that you have more work, so she's more efficient at her job. Has that ever occurred to you? The point is your outside jobs do not and should not affect the household work at home in a house you both share. And she's pregnant, which ... my dude ... really? So, in the example you gave us, you were in a meeting, but is that the only time you've had this happen, maybe when you weren't in a meeting? She reacted a bit rashly, but it might be she had reached peak frustration with a common experience.  \n\n\nI suggest the two of you dividing chores for each week and sticking to a schedule first. X chore done by X time by you and X chore done by X time by her. (I bet she always finishes hers first. Does she? Watch and see if this is true.) Make this chore division equal and do not ask her if it's time for you to do it. Also, if you are a man, which isn't entirely clear but seems likely per your conversation about work vs housework, you've been trained to expect someone else to prompt you to do the work and not see the mess. You're gonna have to train yourself out of that. That might take marriage counseling, honestly.  \n\n\nDoling out household chores based solely on your perception of \"I do more work in my real job\" is an interesting concept, but not a good idea. Just divide the work evenly. Also, when she's had the baby, this could get even worse. For her. If she has to tell you what to do or has to cajole you into things.   \n\n\nFinally, sit down and come up with a system for meals because she was hangry and you don't want her committing hangricide here. She needs snacks prepped for her. That can be a chore you both share. And maybe have a cut off time when work is done. That's just healthy work management and a whole different subject. But don't work past your work hours unless you're paid.", "But saying \u2018when I can\u2019 and \u2018I try\u2019 still means she has to manage the majority of it and pick up for you when you don\u2019t pitch in.

She is not there to do all these things for you, it\u2019s not strictly about working hours, it\u2019s about partnership and being there for each other and not expecting the other to manage it all. She is clearly already feeling resentful of what she has to manage, you\u2019d be a fool to ignore that.

My husband has back to back meetings and for a while there couldn\u2019t even take a lunch break and ran over all the time. I wfh 3 days a week but have significant downtime because a portion of my job is to be available for emergencies. We are ahead of you by a bit where we have 2 children (3yo and 1yo), the older one with moderately high special needs so hopefully I can give you some perspective of what this looks like after children. \n\nI, like your wife, like to get stuff done around the house on my down time. Compared to before children there is 100x more things to do. Example- Laundry doesn\u2019t increase linearly with each kid but exponentially. I don\u2019t know how it happens because they don\u2019t wear multiple outfits a day but I have 5loads of laundry a week at least where my husband and I could get away with 2 maybe 3 if it had been a while with just the two of us! Its insane!  I also have a housekeeper that comes every other week to do the deeper scrubbing. Still I find if I don\u2019t do some of this stuff during the week days we fall into chaos. Your wife\u2019s load will only increase and you\u2019ve got less than 9months till it does. \n\nMy husband, like you, works when he\u2019s at work clock in to clock out. His job is relentless and he loves it. But this left me feeling like I was doing EVERYTHING because I was. He didn\u2019t have the time and when he did have time he was doing things like taking my oldest to therapy which is also extremely important but that started becoming the only thing he was doing for our family- work and a developmental therapy session twice a week. \n\nI was drowning trying to keep up. Leaving off more and more of work to do more around the house because there just wasn\u2019t time. I was falling behind at work now  weekends were spent making the specialized food for my son, mountains of laundry (it literally never ends), grocery shopping/errands running, therapy exercises all punctuated by nap times and feeding times and maybe just maybe if I had everything else checked off we could get 1-2 hours in at the park or other event for the kids. \n\nSure my husband helped on the weekends but it wasn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s no time in there to get the  vacuuming done, the floors swept and mopped regularly (you have no idea how dirty your floors are until a crawling infant finds something on them to put in their mouth!), bathrooms wiped down regularly (kids are always peeing in the bathtub), beds made, sheets changed, and while I\u2019m getting a service for this it\u2019s only every other week- this stuff has to happen weekly at the least and we can\u2019t afford more. \n\nSo my husband and I had to sit down and have a talk. He is entitled to an hour lunch break at work that he wasn\u2019t taking. I told him he had to set up boundaries to take that break. I would happily make lunch if he could rotate a load of laundry/make a bed/spray down a bathroom/sweep and swifter/ vacuum/empty the dishwasher/wash that pot that was soaking from last nights dinner. Basically any chore or combination of chores were around the house for that first 30 minutes. He had to have a hard stop at the end of the day. No more \u201cI work till 5 so I\u2019ll start my last meeting at 5\u201d. If someone needs 30min at the end of the work day that meeting needs to start at 4:30 unless there\u2019s an emergency. 9/10 times the work can keep till the next day and if it can\u2019t it needed to be communicated clearly. We talked about being more aware of ourselves. I told him if he would just put his damned clothes in the hamper when he took them off I wouldn\u2019t have to spend 15-20 minutes going around the house looking for dirty clothes (he has a bad habit of just dropping clothes). Wiping up spills as they happen (looking at you toothpaste on the counter) takes less than a minute at the time and saves me 10minutes of wiping down counters. Making the bed when you get up first thing in the morning takes 5 minutes of the both of you do it and checks off a chore without it being a chore. Putting your dish directly in the dishwasher instead of the sink alleviates me from having to sort the dirty dishes. So many LITTLE adjustments in our habits have a great effect on my work load. He also now takes over when he gets off work. Immediately finishing up some of the tasks still left. I pick up the kids in the afternoons so he gets some time to wrap up and when the kids get home about 5 it\u2019s family time. I can\u2019t tell you how him emptying the dishwasher (if it\u2019s not already done), changing the diapers when they come in, dealing with the 3yo lunch box and settling in with the kids so I can make dinner in a clean kitchen without being hung on makes all the difference in the world. \n\nI will also close by saying that your wife is pregnant. She\u2019s likely having nesting compulsions. My husband would take my son for therapy when I was pregnant with my second and come home to the kitchen entirely rearranged. It\u2019s crazy, as women, how our brains require themselves during pregnancy so that sweeping and scrubbing is like an itch that needs scratching. Look around you and ask what can I do in the time that I have to make her life easier. Stop helping your wife and start living with her. Congratulations on the baby and good luck!", "I mean, think about it this way. If you just had a roommate, not a wife and you both worked jobs, would you expect that roommate to pitch in more and tell you what to do if you thought his job was easier/less work?

ABSOLUTELY NOT.", "Seems like his job is demanding and it's possible he couldn't get out of the meeting. Yes. These things happen. She chooses to clean during work hours when she's not busy. \n\nInstead of communicating she's been passive aggressive from the jump. \n\nEverytime we see these stories and it's a SAHM people jump all over the man for not pulling his weight. \n\nThat isn't the case here. \n\nHow do you figure this isn't a one off? She knows and has known his hours. If she has an issue she needs to be a god damned adult and open her mouth.", "This is not about him not doing chores at home.\n\nThis is about him not helping at the exact time when his wife has downtime in her work. It is about him having meeting exactly when he said he will have meeting and him buying fast-food dinner 30 minutes later then she expected. None of that is good reason to blame him for not helping around the house enough.\n\nMoreover they are two without the kids. The housework is fully doable after work, even for people who both travel to work.", "It\u2019s a communication problem - she feels they need cleaning, I don\u2019t. Rather than asking me to clean she just does it while I\u2019m working and can\u2019t", "Then you learn to be better. Cooking good food is not an innate ability like some lazy people want to think. Good cooks usually grow up around good cooks so they learn that way. Those who haven't, have a plethora of resources to learn. \n\nThe number of people who come on here with the \"spouse is better at cooking so I can't cook\" nonsense is ridiculous. You two should get together and meal prep.\n\nThe real problem is: you say shes taking a whole day to clean sometimes. If the rule is she cooks you clean, why is that much mess even around to clean? \n\n\nYou're NTA for this specific situation. You were at work and she's being unreasonable. However, it sounds like you're probably the AH otherwise.", "Well you best try harder. Cooking is a basic adult skill and it's not ok that you're making excuses so that she does more.", "I've known several, seen the hunger,misery, and subsequent crankiness.", "That\u2019s not how things work at all. There are no min/max hours for exempt employees. It\u2019s whatever the employer deems appropriate.", "It absolutely does fall under this. Salaried positions pay you to do the job, not work a certain amount of hours.", "For sure, never been pregnant but my best friend is for the first time and she is going through it rn. Even bringing home flowers as a surprise would be a nice touch, I know it\u2019s cheesy but it\u2019s a great thought. \n\nNot saying you need to like pull all the weight or whatever, but be gentle with her. But still stand your ground", "What's gonna happen when the baby comes? There will be a lot more to do and I assume you plan on keeping your current jobs. How much is gonna be left to her because your job is more difficult and you'll help out \"when you can\"? Obviously it seems like care during work will be on her, what about after? What about nights, will she be expected to do most if not all the night stuff because your job is harder? What about the chores that seem to already be mostly done by her? While in this very specific scenario about not getting the food at exactly 5:00pm you're not the asshole. It sounds like there are underlying problems of you not pulling your weight in general and if that continues after the baby is born that can cause alot of very real issues for your marriage. At the end of the day, you're both working and while your paid work may be more difficult than hers, she's picking up a lot more unpaid work then you because you only do a couple chores every now and then when you have time, but she makes time to do those tasks because they need to be done.", "That's my point. If it's a roommate, we divide things evenly. If it's a partner, the woman does most of the work at home. Statistically. Always. Childcare too. Even if they both have full time jobs and the excuse is always \"the man is making a bit more\" but since women are paid less because they are women ...\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this? In the home, with two people with full time jobs, they should divvy up the chores equally. Period. We should not be continuing \"women are worth less so must do more to be equal\" in the home.", "But she doesn't have a part time job. And you not working inside your working hours is not her fault. It's yours. You really gotta stop doing that for both of you, but especially YOU. Work can be rewarding but you should be paid for all of it. Consider the possibility you're transferring frustrations about your job over to her instead of blaming it on yourself and your demanding boss.   \n\n\nAnyway, I get it. But you need  boundaries for work. Start with \"only what I'm being paid to do.\" You guys, or you alone, might want to talk this one out with a therapist before the baby is born. Because decisions made on 15 minute intervals of sleep, every few hours, are never good ones and that's the schedule for babies. (It's not amount of sleep after they are born. It's consecutive amounts of sleep. You'll catch 15 here and there.) You seem like a pretty nice person. Just ... this could expand into a bigger problem and for the sake of your family, you both need to work it out.", "But we don't know how long the chores have been waiting without being done. I think reasonable communication between them is important, but it's clear from his conversation he thinks her full time job being less work means she should pick up more work at home, which is, imo, not right.", "Then he shouldn't work hours he's not being paid. He states his hours are from 9-5. That's it. He shouldn't work past that. Having a salary doesn't mean 24/7 availability. Exempt employees shouldn't work more than 40.", "8-5. Says that. \n\nOne time a meeting was at 5. \n\n\nSays that. \n\nThese things happen.\n\nShe asked him to go get food and he said he had a meeting at 5. Maybe that was the time for her to open her mouth.", "The issue is he is choosing to work during non work hours instead of being helpful. He is work extra unpaid hours, it\u2019s not like him working more is helping them financially. So if he is choosing to spend his time volunteering for his job he should is expect his chooses have consequences. One of which is an angry wife, his all setting a precedent that he will put his job first, which is not great when he will be a dad in a few months", "Please refer to my previous comment but I will expand re-floors. You don\u2019t know how disgusting your floors are until you watch your baby crawl over them, pick at something you can barely see, and then\u2026PUT IT IN THEIR MOUTH! \ud83e\udd22 I was in camp vacuum 1-2 times a month till I had babies. It needs to be done daily dude, it just does.", "She cooks, he cleans. This is a normal arrangement.", "And this is why work culture in the US will never change. If we continually accept our employers stealing more and more of our lives to stuff extra cash into some already obscenely wealthy person's pocket we will never have a better work experience. Expect better for yourself and the future generations.", "Mmmk.", "He was asked what his \u201cnormal\u201d hours are. Not what his contractually obligated hours are. By all means, if you have a salaried position and have been told that\u2019s the only time you are expected, great!  But that\u2019s not the norm.  It is extremely common for jobs to be typically 9-5, but regularly have longer hours due to meetings, deadlines, etc.  this idea that you only have to work 40 hours a week and then you\u2019re done or owed overtime is not reality.  Exempt employees do not have a 40 hour work week.  There is literally no min/max. It\u2019s whether the employer seems appropriate.", "He actually admits he works more quite a bit.", "But if his meeting are from 8-5 there could be one at 5. This was a one time thing from what we are told. And how do you know he was unpaid? \n\nHe got a break at 4 and a rescheduled meeting was at 5. So he did take a break and pushed the work 30 minutes at the end. \n\nHe went to get food and she was. Already there and asked for take out. He could go at 5. That's what he said. \n\nThere was zero communication. That's the issue. \n\nAnd she has had no problem--from what we are told--until now. And if she's had it? She hasn't said it. So sorry but that's on her. People aren't mind readers.", "His assigned 8 hours is 8-5, presumably with a 1 hour lunch.  He\u2019s working an extra 30 minutes.  If he wasn\u2019t expected to work the extra 30 minutes they would pay him ~10% less.  Since they expect overtime they pay his 10% more, so he\u2019s not working for free.  The pay for the overtime is rolled into his salary.", "Exempt employees still shouldn't work more than 40 hours and if they have to put in that much overtime, it's the employer's fault for not hiring enough people.  \n\n\nAnd you're not correct about there are no maximum. This is a bad mindset, to think you must be on call for a job 24/7.", "And this will happen. She needs to communicate her issue instead of being passive aggressive.", "He\u2019s salary and his work schedule is 9-5 so every day 8a-9a he is choosing to volunteer his time to his boss instead of helping out around the house. He is also not being paid to work after 5 thus he is choosing to once again volunteer instead for supporting his wife. He can and shouldn\u2019t said I am unable to work past 5. I can do this meeting at the originally scheduled time or we can reschedule it to a different day.", "No one said you have to be on call 24 hours a day (although there are jobs where that is necessary\u2026).  It very well may be that the solution to OP\u2019s home problems is to find a less demanding job,  but OP isn\u2019t working overtime. You are 100% wrong that the job cannot require more, and if he suddenly decides that working any more than 40 hours per week is a problem for him, he will almost certainly lose his job.   You are conflating 20 different things.  By all means, stroke then work-life balance that is most appropriate for your situation, but \u201cexempt\u201d jobs by definition are not hourly. It has nothing to do with mindset.", "She likely has communicated these issues many times. Yes, she was hasty on this last one, likely due to hunger, but seriously, it's clearly not a one off.   \n\n\nHe needs to set boundaries at his job.", "He said he has meetings from 8-5. That's how it's been. \n\nAgain. If she had an issue she should use her big girl words. \n\nAnd that's exactly what Reddit would be telling a man."]}
