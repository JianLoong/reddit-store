{"id": 30515, "submission_id": "17pymza", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend I am no longer helping to plan our trip after he ate one of my cookies?", "selftext": "Last weekend my partner and I, (40F) and (40M), went to the grocery store together. He was buying groceries for himself (we don't live together) but told me I could pick out a snack for myself. I picked the new birthday flavored Oreo cookies and he picked out the original Oreo's for himself. When we got back home I opened mine and had 3, I shared a few with him too before I went to bed. In the morning I noticed he ate 3 rows of mine while I was sleeping and didn't touch his box. I forgot to bring what was left of mine home with me as we don't live together and I asked him to please not eat the last row. He told me he wouldn't. \n\nNow as per the title, my partner and I booked a trip to Tokyo for next year. I am always the one who does the planning and the booking, not because I want to, but because my partner is just not a planner. I have been endlessly reading online about places to go while we are there and figuring everything out with the JR Rail passes and Universal Studies and there is a lot to know if you've never booked that stuff before. I called him last night to tell him some things I figured out, but he was too busy gaming and not listening. For me to try and figure everything out by myself can be a little stressful/frustrating so that weighs on me a little. \n\nFast forward to this morning, I told him I tried a new cookie my mom gave me last night but that they weren't as good as the ones we got last weekend, and I hope he didn't eat anymore of the birthday Oreos I left at his place. He said he did eat one. I asked him why as he already ate 90% of them and has his own box he can open, he told me he wasn't arguing with me about a cookie and that I can go buy more and that he doesn't feel bad at all about eating one of mine. I ended up just hanging up the phone and bursting into tears. \n\nNow I know it's just a cookie and this whole post is something a toddler would probably only get upset over, but it's the principal that matters to me. I feel like I have been doing everything with this trip and then have a boyfriend who doesn't care to help and is also being selfish. I ended up sending him a text telling him how upset I was and that if he wants certain things done on the trip, he can figure it out for himself. \n\nI guess I just want to know AITA over this cookie situation?

This is about being overwhelmed doing all of the planning for the Tokyo trip with no help from your partner.  Planning excursion trips, navigating train times, mapping out things to do in each area you visit, etc take a lot of time and preparation.\n\nNTA to feel overwhelmed.\n\nWe recently went to London and Ireland for 10 days.  It was a  blast, but it took a lot of time for the 2 of us to make our wish lists, coordinate when it make sense to do stuff, getting tickets (and planning a train/bus ride) to Harry Potter world and The Globe Theater, set aside free time to explore and relax, and so on.  I can't imagine dumping all of that on my partner.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not about the trip, and also not about the cookies. It's about a general pattern in this relationship where you feel unheard and uncared for. It seems like this has been going on for a long time.\n\nThere are some talks in order between you and your boyfriend. And if he doesn't take you seriously then, maybe it's time for you to end this relationship and find one where you are treated with respect and courtesy. From what I read here, it looks to me like he is taking you for granted.", "Why are you with someone who 1-doesn't respect you?  2- doesn't bother to input even half the effort that you input into the relationship and 3- can't see that it IS NOT ABOUT COOKIES, but the way he treats you and takes you for granted in general?\n\nOnly you can answer these questions, but you MUST ASK them to YOURSELF.", "NTA\n\n\nYou had lots of stress and this cookie issue was just the trigger\n\nI think you should have some rest\n\nAlso... do you really need that relationship?

I am sure that this is just one of many incidents that show how little consideration he has for you. \n\nI do all our trip planning as well, but my husband listens when I talk about plans and is always appreciative of all the work I put into making our trip so interesting  and economical. He tells everyone that we had a fabulous time because of my planning and organization skills. \n\nIf you can't get your deposits refunded and still go on this trip, be sure to plan all the activities that you would enjoy. A maiko performance, Japanese tea ceremony, lesson in how to prepare sushi. forest bathing, an 8 hour hike starting at sunrise. These are not activities that I am recommending, rather suggesting to you that you book activities that he would dislike, but you might enjoy. :)\n\nWhen he whines, you can sweetly smile and say, \"But I tried to get you involved in the planning.\"\n\nOnce home you can dump him and find a more considerate and interesting boyfriend.", "NTA, but ffs, dump him.

The fact that he would rather game than listen to your valid concerns shows that he doesn\u2019t seem to think his behavior is a problem.  He\u2019s 40 years old ffs.  He\u2019s not a teenage boy.
