{"id": 30515, "submission_id": "17pymza", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend I am no longer helping to plan our trip after he ate one of my cookies?", "selftext": "Last weekend my partner and I, (40F) and (40M), went to the grocery store together. He was buying groceries for himself (we don't live together) but told me I could pick out a snack for myself. I picked the new birthday flavored Oreo cookies and he picked out the original Oreo's for himself. When we got back home I opened mine and had 3, I shared a few with him too before I went to bed. In the morning I noticed he ate 3 rows of mine while I was sleeping and didn't touch his box. I forgot to bring what was left of mine home with me as we don't live together and I asked him to please not eat the last row. He told me he wouldn't. \n\nNow as per the title, my partner and I booked a trip to Tokyo for next year. I am always the one who does the planning and the booking, not because I want to, but because my partner is just not a planner. I have been endlessly reading online about places to go while we are there and figuring everything out with the JR Rail passes and Universal Studies and there is a lot to know if you've never booked that stuff before. I called him last night to tell him some things I figured out, but he was too busy gaming and not listening. For me to try and figure everything out by myself can be a little stressful/frustrating so that weighs on me a little. \n\nFast forward to this morning, I told him I tried a new cookie my mom gave me last night but that they weren't as good as the ones we got last weekend, and I hope he didn't eat anymore of the birthday Oreos I left at his place. He said he did eat one. I asked him why as he already ate 90% of them and has his own box he can open, he told me he wasn't arguing with me about a cookie and that I can go buy more and that he doesn't feel bad at all about eating one of mine. I ended up just hanging up the phone and bursting into tears. \n\nNow I know it's just a cookie and this whole post is something a toddler would probably only get upset over, but it's the principal that matters to me. I feel like I have been doing everything with this trip and then have a boyfriend who doesn't care to help and is also being selfish. I ended up sending him a text telling him how upset I was and that if he wants certain things done on the trip, he can figure it out for himself. \n\nI guess I just want to know AITA over this cookie situation?

If he isn't aware of the issue, it's impossible for him to fix it.\n\nI think that the cookie was just a snapping point for you, you've been bottling up how you've felt and obviously resented him for not helping, and he did something that upset you at a point where you've bottled up too much and now your punishment doesn't line up with the crime.", "NTA. It wasn't the cookie. It was the complete lack of fucks he gives about helping you do things for the two of you, not listening when you were trying to talk to him, and expecting you to do all the heavy lifting in the relationship.

I just feel there are deeper issues with your bf you've yet to come to terms with, maybe.  If it really is the cookie thing only, just buy more cookies?

It sounds like you can't get him to help plan the trip or to value what is important to you. I suggest telling him that you need to have a serious discussion and then have a face to face about what is bothering you. Make the cookie a minor example. If you lead with that, he'll dismiss you as being childish.

So, to do all of that and he can't do something as simple as not eat your cookies, would grind my gears too. To his point, he could buy more cookies, so why eat yours after saying you wouldn't--not to mention you have your own cookies!

Seriously how?\n\nI keep seeing people claiming this guy is a massive asshole, he's selfish, he's treating her like a mom/maid, but all we know is that he ate some cookies and doesn't like to plan trips.\n\nYou have no idea how the planning process has been outside of OP planning a lot and him not planning much at all. It could be, wait for it, he prefers a less structured approach to travel and she likes to over-structure too much. Also, he *paid* for the food, it's not like he's living in her house, on her dime, having her do all the chores lol. He's a grown man who has his own hobbies, lives on his own and pays for his own bills.

Don\u2019t let him take you for granted.", "This was exactly what I was thinking. Of course this isn't about a cookie. It's about a man who's perfectly content to let his partner do all the work to plan extensive travel and then act selfishly over something so minor. He had no reason to eat that cookie but at the very least, he should have been apologetic. I know he's the one who bought them but they were specifically for her. It's just rude, especially because she was so clear that she didn't want him to eat them.\n\nOP, you may want to rethink whether these types of trips are worth going on with him. He sits back, lets you do everything (I hope he at least pays his share!), and just shows up when told. What a lovely way to travel! For him. Let me guess, he doesn't appreciate your efforts, doesn't thank you, doesn't compliment the things/places he enjoys, and isn't afraid to complain about the things he doesn't. And it's probably your job to keep track of passport expiration dates and do the work to ensure his is renewed in a timely manner, too, isn't it?!\n\nI hope I'm wrong about all of that but if I'm not, either split the tasks and give him a list of things to do (when traveling, especially internationally, and especially with flights and hotels involved, \"not being a planner\" is not an option), go alone, or ask a friend to join you, instead. Maybe if he sits at home while you're traveling with someone who did the work to make sure they could be included (you know, an *adult*), he'll realize you're not going to stand for being taken for granted anymore. \n\nHe's 40. This is who he is so if he's unwilling to step up and help you with travel planning and continues to do little disrespectful things like eat the cookies you asked him not to eat, get used to it. This is how it's going to be forever. I don't know how long you've been together but I'm guessing this is how it's been for you two the entire time you've been together. You're NTA in this situation but you'll be the AH to yourself if you don't sit him down and explain how you felt about the cookie and that *it isn't about the cookie *, but that you need him to step up and help with planning these trips and show some respect for you and your partnership. Good luck to you, OP!", "Marinara flags all around!", "To be fair, he was the one who paid for the cookies. And she chose to leave them at *HIS* house. He\u2019s a jerk, but technically they were his. As he paid for them and they don\u2019t share the grocery bill.", "Anyone who cries over a cookie is stressed and unhappy (or hormonal).

It\u2019s like he ate them to spite her. He has a whole entire pack of his own he could be eating but he just had to eat the ones she begged him to save for her?", "lol that was a good one hehe", "Try the toffee ones...so good!", "If I read the original post correctly, he paid for them in the first place?", "\\>Anyone who cries over a cookie is stressed and unhappy (or hormonal).\n\nI never said that it wasn't the case. She's obviously stressed about the planning of the trip and she bottles up her emotions until something miniscule makes her snap and then she wonders whether or not she's an asshole because she blew up over a cookie.\n\nObviously it isn't about a cookie, obviously it's about her feeling like her BF isn't being considerate, but at the same rate to try and make a sweeping statement about a person with such strong language is a bit much considering we're working on such limited information from a biased source.\n\nTo her, she might see every little slight or interaction and build it up every time it happens, but to him it may be nothing he's aware of. It could be that she's hyper sensitive to every little tiny transaction, and her blowing up consists primarily of those situations and the BF is getting tired of dealing with her getting upset over trivial things.\n\nThere's a lot that could be going on here, based on the information all you can really say is that it appears to be about more than the food here, and that there's a difference in how they expect this relationship to go and they should communicate about it with each other. If she comes back with an update, and talks about more of his behavior where he treats her poorly, sure we can start throwing around things like \"disrespectful,\" \"selfish\", and \"asshole\", but there are plenty of relationships where one person hyperfocuses on small transgressions and overreacts to the little things and the other gets callous from dealing with it.", ">You'd think you'd see that with the vantage point you must have, seeing how much above us you think you are.\n\nLol God you're so fucking dramatic.

I'd be livid.\n\nYes, either one can go buy more, but this is a respect issue.", "OK, edgelord. Go do your homework.", "I suppose. It sounds like a complete non-issue to me.", "I\u2019m an edge lord for saying jumping to conclusions and berating someone who isn\u2019t capable of speaking up for themselves?\n\nReally? That\u2019s the hill you want to die on?", "It is lack of regard for the other person. This issue alone might not be a big deal. But he isn't help plan the trip, he isn't paying attention when she tries to talk about planning, and he is eating the treat that was supposed to her treat. If it was just the cookies it might not be a big deal but in combination it is another example of him not seeming to care about her feelings or her.", "And this is the one you want to die on? Look we all have our fatty moments, but a normal person who cares about their partner keeps their promises. If he said he wouldn\u2019t eat them but couldn\u2019t help himself in a moment of weakness, he would replace what he ate/just go buy her some new cookies. Yeah, he paid for them, but they were a gift for her, and he ate them all like a selfish asshole.", "Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding something. Here\u2019s what I think I read. I think they were going to the store because he was going grocery shopping for food for his home. They do not live together. While they were grocery shopping, he decided that he was going to buy a snack, and he asked her if there was anything she wanted. She picked out cookies. Wall at his home, she ate some of the cookies that she chose for a snack. Then she went to her own home. All of the groceries that he purchased remains at his home. So for me, I don\u2019t see what the big deal is that he ate one of the cookies that he purchased.\n\nAs for the trip planning? At no point did she mention ever asking for his assistance or input in the planning at all. She just says that he\u2019s bad at planning so she decided to do all of it. Then, she called him while he was in the middle of something else, and was upset that he didn\u2019t want to hear her talking about the planning. All she had to do was say \u201chey, I\u2019d like to talk to you about some of the stuff with the planning. When would be a good time?\u201d", "For me personally maybe this is controversial but I do feel some things don\u2019t need to be explicitly communicated. I get your angle but I guess for me, especially when it comes to chores both parties in a relationship should be proactive. Like for example I shouldn\u2019t need to tell my bf to clean up the cat vomit as he passes it and vice versa he should not need to tell me. This is one of those cases in my opinion. Both OP and her bf are going on this trip, it shouldn\u2019t need to be said by OP that both parties should be involved in the planning.", ">I called him last night to tell him some things I figured out, but he was too busy gaming and not listening. For me to try and figure everything out by myself can be a little stressful/frustrating so that weighs on me a little.\n\nApparently OP DID try to discuss her plans for the trip with him, but bf could not be arsed to stop gaming to listen. If your SO is trying to talk to you about a matter that concerns both of you, she shouldn't have to beseech it as a special favor that you listen. If you're doing something then it's your responsibility to apologize and circle back when ready, not hers to beg you to pencil her in in your schedule.", "Right. There\u2019s not enough context here. Did she just start doing all of the planning without even consulting him or asking him? Did she just take over and not even ask his opinion on anything? I agree, the burden shouldn\u2019t necessarily be hers, but she had no way mentions any kind of communication between the two of them about it.", "Right. From what I read, he was in the middle of something. It doesn\u2019t matter what he was in the middle of. He was doing something else and she wanted him to drop everything to talk about what she wanted to talk about when she wanted to talk about it. I think it would\u2019ve been very easy to just ask him if they could talk about it when he was available.", "Again, not enough context. If my hubby is in a match, or round, I don\u2019t talk to him. Same in reverse if I\u2019m in a PvP match or story instance. If I\u2019m playing a turn based game like Rome 2 I can always save and take a break, or at least pause if I\u2019m in a battle.\n\nPeople can indulge their hobbies too much and that should lead to a discussion. But being derisive of them is a compatability issue."]}
