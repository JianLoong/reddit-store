My son (15m) is in a wheelchair and has other physical special needs, so this is especially concerning to us. His school is also aware and announced last year that they were working on evacuation plans that accommodated their special needs population and now they're rolling them out. \n\nThe plan specifically for my son, who is the only wheelchair user in the school, essentially is for one of his classmates (15m?) to carry him out of the building. First of all, NO. It's not okay to make a student responsible for making sure any other student gets evacuated. It would be a nice gesture and all if they wanted to, but still no. They don't have the training, and there's no way this kid is strong enough anyway. They said that he could absolutely do it without the chair because he's been able to pick up other people that weigh more than my son, which ?????. My wife only asked if he agreed, and they said they didn't present it as an option. IMO, that's even worse. \n\nI told them this isn't a plan, and they needed to come up with something else. They said they couldn't think of anything else, but would meet with us \"later\". My wife and I ended up arguing over it. Forcing some random kid with no training to be obligated to do it is even worse than no plan.\nAt best, that means there isn't a plan because you would never get them to do it in the emergency, and even if you somehow did, it would probably be more dangerous than doing nothing with the risk of injury. She thinks we need to accept this plan because it's only in case of an emergency, which would probably never happen, but she thinks that a plan in place that isn't the normal \"make them wait in the stairwell\" or \"just don't think about it\" that puts responsibility on someone will have a better outcome because people won't just be able to have him be an afterthought. \n\n\nI want this plan GONE, and my wife is in tears saying that I want our son to just be forgotten if something happens. I don't, I just want an actual plan that could safely be followed, and one that requires a teacher to argue with another kid about doing something objectively unsafe until he either complies or bolts isn't it.", "created_utc": 1680368322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128s0kh/aita_for_taking_down_my_sons_schools_emergency/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This plan violates PL 94-142. You can now sue the school. Talk to a lawyer who specializes in these suits. Don't look for cash, just for a plan that adheres to the law.", "NTA. I have a degree in emergency management and this plan is irresponsible of the school to even present. What if that kid isn\u2019t there that day? Or moves? And just because emergencies are unlikely doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a solid plan. I\u2019d request a meeting to brainstorm, in no way should this be the only thing they thought of. If they refuse find out who their insurance is and give them a call.", "NTA\n\nThe schools plan is terrible and negligent.  \n\nNo child should be responsible for a peer, especially at a time of chaotic crisis. \nI don't understand your wife's logic since you clearly want  ADULTS To be thinking about him. (Also who is the hypothetical backup peer if superkid is out sick?)\n\nI am guessing the school wants you on board for legal reasons.  Not a lawyer, but dont do it.\n\nPs whats the fire emergency plan? I'm guessing stairwell?", "NTA.  \n\n\nMy high school USED to have an emergency plan for the kids in wheelchairs that consisted of:   \n\n\n\"Let them wait by the elevators til the janitor arrives to unlock the elevator and get them down to the ground floor\" - the elevators automatically stop working when the emergency alarm goes of.  \n\n\nOne day they tested the fire alarm and a kid in a wheelchair was on an upper floor, and it was only then that all of her classmates realized they were supposed to head down the fire stairs and leave her behind, and they all collectively went on strike and refused to leave the kid in a wheelchair behind. The school failed the fire safety test that day because about twenty kids were all standing around the kid in the wheelchair saying they werern't going to move until they knew she was safe.  \n\n\nThat \"emergency plan\" got changed before they did a fire alarm test again - a manually-operated stair lift I think? We all got lectured on how when the fire alarm sounds you leave the building promptly and obey orders,  but I get it then and now: you cannot expect kids just to run off and leave their friend behind in the hope someone will come back to save her.  \n\n\nSo yeah: make sure your school has a REAL emergency plan, and one that can be tested when they have a trial run.", "NTA. A paid adult needs to be responsible.  And a second paid adult needs to be the backup\nDid anyone ask  the other kid? Or his parents? \nThis\" plan\" is no plan! .", "NTA. That is not a plan. The school needs to do far better than that.\n\nForcing one student to be responsible for another student in an emergency is a scapegoat for the teachers doing nothing and it needs to be put back on the teachers to find more viable options.\n\nEspecially if the other kid did not get a choice in the matter.", "NTA on any level. What if the designated kid is off sick, or God forbid,  already incapacitated?? I'm no expert in this,  but I'm sure if you contact your local fire department, they will be able to help you come up with alternatives. And yes,  this is a hill to die on. Take it all the way to the top of the district is needed,  and if that doesn't work,  call your local news outlet. In every instance of a school shooting, the people say, 'we never thought it would happen here. ' So it DOES happen anywhere,  and having no viable plan in place for your son is unacceptable across the board. I hope your son will never need this plan,  but I pray you are able to demand and receive the best one possible!", "NTA\n\nThis is indeed worse than no plan because it will ensure that your son is left at the mercy of another, untrained person, who, as a student, cannot be liable for anything happening to your son and is under no legal obligation to follow this so called plan.\n\nYou know what this is? The easy way out to avoid responsibility!\n\nHere's what will happen if you accept that 'plan'.\n\nThat's it. Nothing else will ever happen.\n\nAnd if an emergency should arrise, your son will be left to another child that might or might not even be there! What if that student gets sick? What of he panics and runs put, because, you know, it's a child too! What if he desperately tries to help your child but fails to do so but there are no adults because of the 'plan'?\n\nThere is no way this is acceptable!\n\nThe plan must involved a trained, **payed, full time employee** of the school and an also trained backup that's also a **paid employee!**\n\nYou can under no circumstances accept this ridiculous attempt to placate you either because then it  **removes their legal responsibility and liability!** If you accept this plan, even temporarily, nothing will change and if anything happens and the plan fails, which it is set up to do, then the school will thow in your face that you were informed in due time and accepted the plan!\n\nWhat you absolutely must do is raising a stink right now! Contact the parents of that other child. I bet they'll not be happy to have their child responsible for another kid whole the adults just leave and let them fend for themselves! \n\nDemand proof of qualification! Demand in writing that the school will take full responsibility for the success of this plan. Demand a backup plan!\n\nAnd if your wife again tells you it's better than if your son is 'forgotten' alone because this is better than no plan then tell her that this will guarantee that he **will** be left alone with another child of the same age that doesn't know what to do and 100% be left behind by the teacher without any other adult person  because **that is exactly the plan!**", "As someone who worked with kiddos that needed extra physical help and kiddos that were nuereodivergent, this is not a plan.  I would suggest that you take a breather, a few days and meet with the principal and or another admin from the building.  (Why would the plan be to carry him when he uses his chair)?    \n\n\nFor reference I worked in a two story building and we practiced a few times a year take the students using chairs or other aids down the stairs in case the elevator was not an option. I was a para pro (teachers aide if you will).  Every staff member was asked to practice.  That way we knew who could and could not manage it, how we could work together, it was part of our professional development.  There is, in my opinion, no way should another student be put in that position.     \n\n\nAt 15, depending on where you child is at, he may be able to offer suggestions too.  There needs to be a solid plan and there needs to be one or two point people who will be responsible for his evacuation.  We also have and ASD program and other people in the building were assigned to come and help us during certain potential situations.     \n\n\nThis can be done, having someone carry your child out, is not a good plan. I think an in person meeting with suggestions would be productive for all of you.  Good luck.", "NTA. The plan they proposed to you is lazy and imo unsafe. Making another 15 year old liable for getting your son out safe is absurd. They need to find a better plan. Good for you for not settling for the bare minimum.", "NTA.   Putting another student responsible for someone else\u2019s life is beyond irresponsible.  During emergency the kids are going to be too freaked out and scared to do anything but follow instruction of adults.  I don\u2019t understand why another teacher or faculty could be responsible for your son.  And forcing it on the other kid without his or his parents permission is lawsuit waiting to happen", "NTA\n\nThe school can purchase an evacuation stair chair and assign a responsible adult\u2014a teacher who works on the second floor?\u2014to learn how to use it to bring your son downstairs (actually several adults, since who knows what the emergency will entail). No way should this be the responsibility of another student.", "NTA! That's no plan. Students should not be put in charge of other students' lives in emergencies. It's up to the school to research proper evacuation strategies for wheelchair-bound people and to choose the appropriate one and communicate it to your son. This may have a low chance of happening but it's incredibly irresponsible of the school staff.", "NTA. This is a terrible \u201cnon plan\u201d. Agree with the other poster who said to ask the local fire department for help & ideas. If nothing else, the school could get evac chairs for the stair wells & teach the staff how to use them in an emergency.", "NTA\n\n* Emergency personnel train to be able to carry people from a building, there is endurance involved, and people are more cumbersome than a weight bar.\n* This is an adult responsibility not a student one. \n* Blatant disrespect for your son\u2019s body and personal autonomy. In not way is it the same as carrying and injured or unconscious person. His physical limitations can and must be planned for.   \n\n* I would make an appointment with your local disability advocate. Where I\u2019m from schools are required to have ramps indoors along side stairs for just this reason.   \n\n\nStand your ground dad, you are in the right. If you are in the US your magic words are ADA and 504 plan. Whether the district has money or not they must comply, federal law.", "NTA.  This is horrendous in every way and you are 100% right.  \n\nThe school has an obligation to fix this.", "NTA No child should be expected to be responsible for another child's health or welfare on school property, especially in emergency protocol. That's the school's responsibility!  Has anyone brought this to the attention of the Superintendent of the district and if so,  has it been escalated to the Board of Ed? If so have you sought out an IDEA attorney?", "NTA. That isn\u2019t a plan. What if the kid is out? What if he is on one end of the building and your son on the other? Did the school talk with the kid\u2019s parents to see if they were OK with their kid being responsible for another kid\u2019s life. Carrying a wheelchair user out like a sack of potatoes is disrespectful, not safe, and most likely illegal.", "Nta. It's something I have never considered, and I expect not many people have. Most children with additional needs, in the UK, have a designated teaching assistant these days. I would not be happy with their \"plan\" either but I don't know what the correct answer is.", "I understand how everyone is feeling, but would like to give a different perspective: I have a friend who lives in Israel. She has a disabled child (who is now grown up). They live not far from the Gaza strip.\nDuring war (which happened multiple times, the boy was between 10 and 16 years old), rocket alarms at the school would be frequent. And indeed, the protocol was for his classmates (they had assigned the strongest boys in his class) to carry him down 2 flights of stairs to the bomb shelter, while the teacher was guiding all the kids. This protocol was practised many times and never failed in the actual rocket alarm cases, of which there were quite a few.\nSo while this is far from ideal, it may be the most pragmatic and fastest way to getting the child to safety in an emergency.", "How on earth can the school reasonably put that responsibility on one of their pupils?\n\nNTA. The plan is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nDoes your son have an IEP or 504 plan in place? If so shouldn't those include an evacuation procedure specific to your child? I absolutely do not believe another minor aged student should be responsible for ensuring your child's safety during an emergency.  Regardless if the minor child was willing. I am guessing that minor child's parents would not be comfortable with their child being the responsible party either. I wouldn't as a parent.  \n\nStart an email chain with principal, superintendent,  school board, etc to get an ethical, legal, and satisfactory evacuation plan in place for your son. It can also benefit all current special needs students as well as future students.", "NAH except the school but you two need to stay a team, and stop debating if this plan is better than none at all. This plan can be set in place while you and the school meet to discuss more appropriate options, keep complaining, and taking this higher if you need to (and it sounds like you will need to.) Your son deserves to be safe too.", "NAH (at least between you and your wife). You're right that this is an objectively terrible plan. She's right that it's better than no plan.\n\nI'm so sorry you have to go through this.", "NAH. The schools plan is horrible.", "INFO: Is part of the emergency plan to have kids hide in a stairwell which has no wheel chair access? I've never heard of anything like that, but I'm assuming it has to make sense in the context of the school. But if that's the plan, your son obviously has to be carried into the stairwell.
