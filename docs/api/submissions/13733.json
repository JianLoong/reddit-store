My son (15m) is in a wheelchair and has other physical special needs, so this is especially concerning to us. His school is also aware and announced last year that they were working on evacuation plans that accommodated their special needs population and now they're rolling them out. \n\nThe plan specifically for my son, who is the only wheelchair user in the school, essentially is for one of his classmates (15m?) to carry him out of the building. First of all, NO. It's not okay to make a student responsible for making sure any other student gets evacuated. It would be a nice gesture and all if they wanted to, but still no. They don't have the training, and there's no way this kid is strong enough anyway. They said that he could absolutely do it without the chair because he's been able to pick up other people that weigh more than my son, which ?????. My wife only asked if he agreed, and they said they didn't present it as an option. IMO, that's even worse. \n\nI told them this isn't a plan, and they needed to come up with something else. They said they couldn't think of anything else, but would meet with us \"later\". My wife and I ended up arguing over it. Forcing some random kid with no training to be obligated to do it is even worse than no plan.\nAt best, that means there isn't a plan because you would never get them to do it in the emergency, and even if you somehow did, it would probably be more dangerous than doing nothing with the risk of injury. She thinks we need to accept this plan because it's only in case of an emergency, which would probably never happen, but she thinks that a plan in place that isn't the normal \"make them wait in the stairwell\" or \"just don't think about it\" that puts responsibility on someone will have a better outcome because people won't just be able to have him be an afterthought. \n\n\nI want this plan GONE, and my wife is in tears saying that I want our son to just be forgotten if something happens. I don't, I just want an actual plan that could safely be followed, and one that requires a teacher to argue with another kid about doing something objectively unsafe until he either complies or bolts isn't it.", "created_utc": 1680368322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128s0kh/aita_for_taking_down_my_sons_schools_emergency/", "score": 806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And just because emergencies are unlikely doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a solid plan. I\u2019d request a meeting to brainstorm, in no way should this be the only thing they thought of.

Not a lawyer, but dont do it.\n\nPs whats the fire emergency plan? I'm guessing stairwell?", "NTA.  \n\n\nMy high school USED to have an emergency plan for the kids in wheelchairs that consisted of:   \n\n\n\"Let them wait by the elevators til the janitor arrives to unlock the elevator and get them down to the ground floor\" - the elevators automatically stop working when the emergency alarm goes of.  \n\n\nOne day they tested the fire alarm and a kid in a wheelchair was on an upper floor, and it was only then that all of her classmates realized they were supposed to head down the fire stairs and leave her behind, and they all collectively went on strike and refused to leave the kid in a wheelchair behind. The school failed the fire safety test that day because about twenty kids were all standing around the kid in the wheelchair saying they werern't going to move until they knew she was safe.  \n\n\nThat \"emergency plan\" got changed before they did a fire alarm test again - a manually-operated stair lift I think? We all got lectured on how when the fire alarm sounds you leave the building promptly and obey orders,  but I get it then and now: you cannot expect kids just to run off and leave their friend behind in the hope someone will come back to save her.  \n\n\nSo yeah: make sure your school has a REAL emergency plan, and one that can be tested when they have a trial run.", "NTA.

Take it all the way to the top of the district is needed,  and if that doesn't work,  call your local news outlet. In every instance of a school shooting, the people say, 'we never thought it would happen here. ' So it DOES happen anywhere,  and having no viable plan in place for your son is unacceptable across the board. I hope your son will never need this plan,  but I pray you are able to demand and receive the best one possible!", "NTA\n\nThis is indeed worse than no plan because it will ensure that your son is left at the mercy of another, untrained person, who, as a student, cannot be liable for anything happening to your son and is under no legal obligation to follow this so called plan.\n\nYou know what this is? The easy way out to avoid responsibility!\n\nHere's what will happen if you accept that 'plan'.\n\nThat's it. Nothing else will ever happen.\n\nAnd if an emergency should arrise, your son will be left to another child that might or might not even be there! What if that student gets sick? What of he panics and runs put, because, you know, it's a child too! What if he desperately tries to help your child but fails to do so but there are no adults because of the 'plan'?\n\nThere is no way this is acceptable!\n\nThe plan must involved a trained, **payed, full time employee** of the school and an also trained backup that's also a **paid employee!**\n\nYou can under no circumstances accept this ridiculous attempt to placate you either because then it  **removes their legal responsibility and liability!** If you accept this plan, even temporarily, nothing will change and if anything happens and the plan fails, which it is set up to do, then the school will thow in your face that you were informed in due time and accepted the plan!\n\nWhat you absolutely must do is raising a stink right now! Contact the parents of that other child. I bet they'll not be happy to have their child responsible for another kid whole the adults just leave and let them fend for themselves! \n\nDemand proof of qualification! Demand in writing that the school will take full responsibility for the success of this plan. Demand a backup plan!\n\nAnd if your wife again tells you it's better than if your son is 'forgotten' alone because this is better than no plan then tell her that this will guarantee that he **will** be left alone with another child of the same age that doesn't know what to do and 100% be left behind by the teacher without any other adult person  because **that is exactly the plan!**", "As someone who worked with kiddos that needed extra physical help and kiddos that were nuereodivergent, this is not a plan.

I was a para pro (teachers aide if you will).  Every staff member was asked to practice.  That way we knew who could and could not manage it, how we could work together, it was part of our professional development.  There is, in my opinion, no way should another student be put in that position.     \n\n\nAt 15, depending on where you child is at, he may be able to offer suggestions too.  There needs to be a solid plan and there needs to be one or two point people who will be responsible for his evacuation.  We also have and ASD program and other people in the building were assigned to come and help us during certain potential situations.     \n\n\nThis can be done, having someone carry your child out, is not a good plan. I think an in person meeting with suggestions would be productive for all of you.  Good luck.", "NTA. The plan they proposed to you is lazy and imo unsafe. Making another 15 year old liable for getting your son out safe is absurd. They need to find a better plan. Good for you for not settling for the bare minimum.", "NTA.   Putting another student responsible for someone else\u2019s life is beyond irresponsible.  During emergency the kids are going to be too freaked out and scared to do anything but follow instruction of adults.

And forcing it on the other kid without his or his parents permission is lawsuit waiting to happen", "NTA\n\nThe school can purchase an evacuation stair chair and assign a responsible adult\u2014a teacher who works on the second floor?\u2014to learn how to use it to bring your son downstairs (actually several adults, since who knows what the emergency will entail). No way should this be the responsibility of another student.", "NTA! That's no plan. Students should not be put in charge of other students' lives in emergencies. It's up to the school to research proper evacuation strategies for wheelchair-bound people and to choose the appropriate one and communicate it to your son.

If so have you sought out an IDEA attorney?", "NTA. That isn\u2019t a plan. What if the kid is out? What if he is on one end of the building and your son on the other? Did the school talk with the kid\u2019s parents to see if they were OK with their kid being responsible for another kid\u2019s life. Carrying a wheelchair user out like a sack of potatoes is disrespectful, not safe, and most likely illegal.", "Nta. It's something I have never considered, and I expect not many people have.

I would not be happy with their \"plan\" either but I don't know what the correct answer is.", "I understand how everyone is feeling, but would like to give a different perspective: I have a friend who lives in Israel. She has a disabled child (who is now grown up). They live not far from the Gaza strip.\nDuring war (which happened multiple times, the boy was between 10 and 16 years old), rocket alarms at the school would be frequent. And indeed, the protocol was for his classmates (they had assigned the strongest boys in his class) to carry him down 2 flights of stairs to the bomb shelter, while the teacher was guiding all the kids. This protocol was practised many times and never failed in the actual rocket alarm cases, of which there were quite a few.\nSo while this is far from ideal, it may be the most pragmatic and fastest way to getting the child to safety in an emergency.", "How on earth can the school reasonably put that responsibility on one of their pupils?\n\nNTA. The plan is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nDoes your son have an IEP or 504 plan in place? If so shouldn't those include an evacuation procedure specific to your child? I absolutely do not believe another minor aged student should be responsible for ensuring your child's safety during an emergency.  Regardless if the minor child was willing. I am guessing that minor child's parents would not be comfortable with their child being the responsible party either.

The bad plan will stay in place for perpetuity", "Do we know that they are in the USA?", "I\u2019d LOVE to hear what the parents of this other child has to say about this forced decision for their child. \n\nBet they aren\u2019t even aware. \n\nI also bet they\u2019ll be LIVID because they\u2019ll want their child worrying about themselves and getting to safety, same as every other parent for their child. \n\nThis is honestly beyond the pale of reasonable and I\u2019m questioning the administrations mental IQ if this is their best solution.", "NTA. I was so upset reading this, I can't imagine how upset you were hearing it. Please take action if they insist on this plan. And I mean today, not talking about it later. Like many other folks have said, outside of the ridiculousness of this plan in itself (if the kid is not there that day, if he panics, the other kid should never have been in a position to have to agree to this in the first place, if something happens to him, etc), this is absolutely a violation that they could be in serious (as they should) trouble over.", "I feel like that's a stretch to say she's an asshole and that she's trying to emotionally manipulate him. Most likely she's just exhausted with fighting the school on every single accommodation their son needs and has kind of thrown in the towel.", "It's US Federal law. We can bet that this student is in the US, where this law should apply.  \n\n\nDisclaimer: I don't know anything about whether or not this law is helpful in this context or not. I'm just saying it's a fair assumption that a US law would apply to a student that is almost certainly in the US.", ">That touches my heart. Children seem to have more smarts and compassion than their ~~educators~~ decision making administrators. \n\nDon't blame the teachers, they don't make the evacuation rules", "Bullshit. \n\nThat\u2019s so fucking insulting to teachers. We aren\u2019t the enemies. It\u2019s admin who came up w these policies, and it\u2019s us who get blamed when something goes wrong. \n\nWere it a real emergency, I *know* for a FACT that at least a half dozen teachers would\u2019ve come up with a way to get that child out safely. Last time they had a fire drill @ the elementary school, every. single. teacher. in the school made sure to evacuate w/ multiple backup plans to get their disabled students out. We put stair chairs (idk what they\u2019re called but it\u2019s the one that you\u2019d see in hospitals for going down stairs w/ an immobilized patient) at each stairwell, made sure that the disabled kids were closest to the exit in any seating arrangement\u2026 do you think we just don\u2019t pay any mind to this? \n\nJust this week, a dozen schools in my area were swatted. Full lockdown, parents thinking their children were dead. Directly after the shooting in Tennessee. Know what the teachers talked about? What we\u2019d do to make sure the disabled kids were able to get to safety. What those students\u2019 schedules were so we\u2019d know which room they\u2019re in at all times & have someone on them. \n\nWe care. So much. And we\u2019re shit on for these systemic failures even though we try our best to solve them.", "You mean administration, right? Because schools don\u2019t trust teachers to pick BOOKS, they sure as shit don\u2019t trust them to develop emergency plans to save students.", "Also bring the parents of this kid into it as well. Make them stand up and say no as well.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat happens to that kid in an emergency if he freaks out and leaves and something happens to your son. You have an un trained 15 year old who will have what ever happens to your son on his conscience. That is despicable.", "so if they go ahead with this plan and there\u2019s a real emergency, your child is most likely dead. this is the biggest hill to die on and you should probably get a lawyer on your side.", "Yes, this.\n\nAt least in newer buildings, the stairwells are pretty fireproof because they are the planned exit routes for fire evacuation.\n\nSo people with limited mobility are instructed to wait inside a stairwell because that is the safest place for them to be while waiting for help.", "I'm assuming these are part of the lovely safety plans and drills US school systems are having to implement instead of law makers addressing school massacres.", "I love/hate when I am made to LOL at the image of of a special-needs student left up the creek in an emergency. (But yes, the plan is \"are you actually high right now??\"-calibre awful.)", "You mention the other child's parents being LIVID - as they should be. I sure would. In an emergency my child's number 1 priority is making sure they are safe, not helping someone else.", "Why do you think this person is in the USA?", "Suing the school doesn't have to be \"you didn't do this now give me money\", at least in the states. Suing for injunctive relief is essentially asking a judge to demand they put in a real plan.\n\nAll laws are local. Don't take my informative post as legal advice. I am not your lawyer. Spay and neuter your pets.", "This isn't how it works. Don't give any more advice on this subject. Sueing in this case means a formal complaint and actions forced by a judge. In some cases the school or teacher would welcome it because it would mean the dumb shit they are being forced to do is now brought to light and can get actual resources to solve it.", "I'm actually going to go against my grain and say it is their fault.\n\nThere are resources that exist for this. There are plans. There are trainings. There are higher bodies the school can appeal to for assistance in retrofitting safety measures. This specific school is responsible for implementing the specific measures their student populace needs. If OP sues this specific school, it will light a fire under the admin team. I know that teachers are asked to do a huge job, and I'm not expecting any individual teachers to solve this, but basic safety is a given in any population that works with children. 'Let's have a totally untrained kid as a key part of our evacuation plan' is a massive error in judgement.", "And how would this kid know where OP\u2019s son is at any given moment? Are they seriously expecting him to keep a copy of OP\u2019s child\u2019s schedule handy, just in case there is an emergency?\n\nThere are established protocols for this. I have no idea why the school isn\u2019t considering any of them.", "Going outside the building isn't the plan for any school violence plan. It's for fires. \n\nSchool violence plans are pretty invariably shelter in place.", "What if the kid is on the other side of the school, or home sick? This is a joke, there isn't a chance a bunch of actual adults thought this through.", "What if the kid can\u2019t do it in the moment- do they have to live with the guilt of maybe abandoning another student during a crisis?", "2 sounds generous. Like, knowing the boys strong enough and generally good natured enough that you hypothetically COULD ask them to do this when I was in high school... a lot of them would go with the buddy assigned to the wheelchair user. A lot of them would hear that was the plan, figure they're in the class with him already, and take him out themselves- they might text the assigned kid that he doesn't need to worry about it, but are you really checking your phone in that situation? Sounds like a great way to have 2 or more disconnected packs of kids roaming the halls missing each other and getting lost in smoke/getting shot/etc", "I went to a high school where the only thing on the first floor were the offices and library. My friend was put in the sled looking thing for emergencies, with a trained adult", "Because folks in other countries aren't as worried about \"All the recent events in the last few years\". They're talking about school shootings.", "It makes MUCH more sense to sue those that can actually change something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the school has 10 fulltime teachers and 12 students that need accomodations, the only way to do it would be to hire more persons ... which they simply CAN NOT DO. Or transfer some of the students to another - larger - school somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to CHANGE something, you need to do something else.", "\"ending another student to go get him \" .. THIS is not something ANY teacher should or would do. Because it would also be keeping that student from being evacuated and keeping them longer in danger. If anything at all happens to that student, the life of the teacher who did this would be over: NEVER working again, being sued to the ground, and ending in prison. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in reality it would be a triage solution: Evacuate all students that CAN be evacuated (So basically those that can move under their own power), and make sure THOSE are safe. THEN send someone capable (fire department, police, ...) back in for the students that can not.", "Hell, what if he's in the bathroom? Or OP's kid is? What if he breaks an arm? How the fuck did *anyone* think this was a good idea?", ".... You can't just count on everybody being in a classroom when ish goes down? And where I live kids sometimes have to walk outside to get to different classes, but not all of those outdoor classrooms have ramps. So, they'd need have a safety plan to get OPs child in from the out safely if that's the case, since ops child is Def old enough to be in high school.", "If your safety plan fails if this one kid happens to be going pee at the wrong time, it's a shit plan. \n\n(Or if he sprains his wrist. Or he's at an event elsewhere. Or if he catches the flu. Or if he had to stay behind to talk to a teacher. Or... look, there's a lot of reasons this is a shit plan)", "The kid responsible for carrying him just happened to stay home that day because he was sick.", "> ... and why the heck do the adults, including the wife, think this is acceptable to place a burden/stress/worry on what is essentially another child?\n\nMy guess is because deep down they don't think it will ever happen, so who cares if the plan sucks?", "Because we also place the burden of fighting back on the same students. We teach them to distract and detain, so why not assist a classmate in escaping too? (Not saying it\u2019s acceptable, just that\u2019s how it is)", "Yeah. I had one girl in my grade in a wheelchair and I could easily carry her out of the school at 15 ( her disease made her weigh probably 90-100 lbs.).  So if I don't text the kid that is supposed to carry her out and they are in a different class, AITA because this kid is now running around the school looking for her?", "I think their local lawyer can better advise them on which direction to go. You have no idea if what you're saying is applicable to OP's location, or anyone else reading. You're getting in the way of meaningful change to live out your internet lawyer fantasies; bad look.", "You can include the state in the suit, but the school district is 100% the correct entity to sue. If you don\u2019t include them, the suit is probably going to be thrown out immediately- you can\u2019t skip over the direct cause of the tort (the school\u2019s actions) to go after an indirect cause (the funding provided by the state). You have to include both. You also don\u2019t know that the school really can\u2019t do anything about it. Unless you\u2019re privy to every aspect of the decision making involved, you absolutely can\u2019t decide that the school doesn\u2019t have alternatives. That information will be divulged during discovery, but you have to actually sue for that to happen.", "The point is there's nothing at all to indicate this is in the USA unless to OP says so.", "Sadly, the world full of I didn't think it would happen. There are too many tragedies. \n\nThere are also legal implications for the school with respect to the safety of both students.", "It's not necessary, but it will add a whole extra level of problems for the school if they want to keep pushing it. It's easier to ignore the one disabled kid's parents than to have the parents of both students involved up in arms- sometimes force is a numbers game. Plus the other kid's parents can add testimony that the other student also isn't comfortable about it. The rescue student's opinion on the matter is extra compelling, because it's proof that they have done no due diligence at all. Can you imagine the school board meeting when this comes up?\n\nLike, yeah, there's probably going to be a lawsuit. But that can take years, depending on who all is involved, and god forbid anything happens in the meantime.", "I can assume whatever I want in my comments until told otherwise by OP.
