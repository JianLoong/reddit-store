My son (15m) is in a wheelchair and has other physical special needs, so this is especially concerning to us. His school is also aware and announced last year that they were working on evacuation plans that accommodated their special needs population and now they're rolling them out. \n\nThe plan specifically for my son, who is the only wheelchair user in the school, essentially is for one of his classmates (15m?) to carry him out of the building. First of all, NO. It's not okay to make a student responsible for making sure any other student gets evacuated. It would be a nice gesture and all if they wanted to, but still no. They don't have the training, and there's no way this kid is strong enough anyway. They said that he could absolutely do it without the chair because he's been able to pick up other people that weigh more than my son, which ?????. My wife only asked if he agreed, and they said they didn't present it as an option. IMO, that's even worse. \n\nI told them this isn't a plan, and they needed to come up with something else. They said they couldn't think of anything else, but would meet with us \"later\". My wife and I ended up arguing over it. Forcing some random kid with no training to be obligated to do it is even worse than no plan.\nAt best, that means there isn't a plan because you would never get them to do it in the emergency, and even if you somehow did, it would probably be more dangerous than doing nothing with the risk of injury. She thinks we need to accept this plan because it's only in case of an emergency, which would probably never happen, but she thinks that a plan in place that isn't the normal \"make them wait in the stairwell\" or \"just don't think about it\" that puts responsibility on someone will have a better outcome because people won't just be able to have him be an afterthought. \n\n\nI want this plan GONE, and my wife is in tears saying that I want our son to just be forgotten if something happens. I don't, I just want an actual plan that could safely be followed, and one that requires a teacher to argue with another kid about doing something objectively unsafe until he either complies or bolts isn't it.", "created_utc": 1680368322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128s0kh/aita_for_taking_down_my_sons_schools_emergency/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And just because emergencies are unlikely doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a solid plan. I\u2019d request a meeting to brainstorm, in no way should this be the only thing they thought of.

Not a lawyer, but dont do it.\n\nPs whats the fire emergency plan? I'm guessing stairwell?", "NTA.  \n\n\nMy high school USED to have an emergency plan for the kids in wheelchairs that consisted of:   \n\n\n\"Let them wait by the elevators til the janitor arrives to unlock the elevator and get them down to the ground floor\" - the elevators automatically stop working when the emergency alarm goes of.  \n\n\nOne day they tested the fire alarm and a kid in a wheelchair was on an upper floor, and it was only then that all of her classmates realized they were supposed to head down the fire stairs and leave her behind, and they all collectively went on strike and refused to leave the kid in a wheelchair behind. The school failed the fire safety test that day because about twenty kids were all standing around the kid in the wheelchair saying they werern't going to move until they knew she was safe.  \n\n\nThat \"emergency plan\" got changed before they did a fire alarm test again - a manually-operated stair lift I think? We all got lectured on how when the fire alarm sounds you leave the building promptly and obey orders,  but I get it then and now: you cannot expect kids just to run off and leave their friend behind in the hope someone will come back to save her.  \n\n\nSo yeah: make sure your school has a REAL emergency plan, and one that can be tested when they have a trial run.", "NTA.

Take it all the way to the top of the district is needed,  and if that doesn't work,  call your local news outlet. In every instance of a school shooting, the people say, 'we never thought it would happen here. ' So it DOES happen anywhere,  and having no viable plan in place for your son is unacceptable across the board. I hope your son will never need this plan,  but I pray you are able to demand and receive the best one possible!", "NTA\n\nThis is indeed worse than no plan because it will ensure that your son is left at the mercy of another, untrained person, who, as a student, cannot be liable for anything happening to your son and is under no legal obligation to follow this so called plan.\n\nYou know what this is? The easy way out to avoid responsibility!\n\nHere's what will happen if you accept that 'plan'.\n\nThat's it. Nothing else will ever happen.\n\nAnd if an emergency should arrise, your son will be left to another child that might or might not even be there! What if that student gets sick? What of he panics and runs put, because, you know, it's a child too! What if he desperately tries to help your child but fails to do so but there are no adults because of the 'plan'?\n\nThere is no way this is acceptable!\n\nThe plan must involved a trained, **payed, full time employee** of the school and an also trained backup that's also a **paid employee!**\n\nYou can under no circumstances accept this ridiculous attempt to placate you either because then it  **removes their legal responsibility and liability!** If you accept this plan, even temporarily, nothing will change and if anything happens and the plan fails, which it is set up to do, then the school will thow in your face that you were informed in due time and accepted the plan!\n\nWhat you absolutely must do is raising a stink right now! Contact the parents of that other child. I bet they'll not be happy to have their child responsible for another kid whole the adults just leave and let them fend for themselves! \n\nDemand proof of qualification! Demand in writing that the school will take full responsibility for the success of this plan. Demand a backup plan!\n\nAnd if your wife again tells you it's better than if your son is 'forgotten' alone because this is better than no plan then tell her that this will guarantee that he **will** be left alone with another child of the same age that doesn't know what to do and 100% be left behind by the teacher without any other adult person  because **that is exactly the plan!**", "As someone who worked with kiddos that needed extra physical help and kiddos that were nuereodivergent, this is not a plan.

I was a para pro (teachers aide if you will).  Every staff member was asked to practice.  That way we knew who could and could not manage it, how we could work together, it was part of our professional development.  There is, in my opinion, no way should another student be put in that position.     \n\n\nAt 15, depending on where you child is at, he may be able to offer suggestions too.  There needs to be a solid plan and there needs to be one or two point people who will be responsible for his evacuation.  We also have and ASD program and other people in the building were assigned to come and help us during certain potential situations.     \n\n\nThis can be done, having someone carry your child out, is not a good plan. I think an in person meeting with suggestions would be productive for all of you.  Good luck.", "NTA. The plan they proposed to you is lazy and imo unsafe. Making another 15 year old liable for getting your son out safe is absurd. They need to find a better plan. Good for you for not settling for the bare minimum.", "NTA.   Putting another student responsible for someone else\u2019s life is beyond irresponsible.  During emergency the kids are going to be too freaked out and scared to do anything but follow instruction of adults.

And forcing it on the other kid without his or his parents permission is lawsuit waiting to happen", "NTA\n\nThe school can purchase an evacuation stair chair and assign a responsible adult\u2014a teacher who works on the second floor?\u2014to learn how to use it to bring your son downstairs (actually several adults, since who knows what the emergency will entail). No way should this be the responsibility of another student.", "NTA! That's no plan. Students should not be put in charge of other students' lives in emergencies. It's up to the school to research proper evacuation strategies for wheelchair-bound people and to choose the appropriate one and communicate it to your son.

This is horrendous in every way and you are 100% right.  \n\nThe school has an obligation to fix this.", "NTA No child should be expected to be responsible for another child's health or welfare on school property, especially in emergency protocol.

If so have you sought out an IDEA attorney?", "NTA. That isn\u2019t a plan. What if the kid is out? What if he is on one end of the building and your son on the other? Did the school talk with the kid\u2019s parents to see if they were OK with their kid being responsible for another kid\u2019s life. Carrying a wheelchair user out like a sack of potatoes is disrespectful, not safe, and most likely illegal.", "Nta. It's something I have never considered, and I expect not many people have.

I would not be happy with their \"plan\" either but I don't know what the correct answer is.", "I understand how everyone is feeling, but would like to give a different perspective: I have a friend who lives in Israel. She has a disabled child (who is now grown up). They live not far from the Gaza strip.\nDuring war (which happened multiple times, the boy was between 10 and 16 years old), rocket alarms at the school would be frequent. And indeed, the protocol was for his classmates (they had assigned the strongest boys in his class) to carry him down 2 flights of stairs to the bomb shelter, while the teacher was guiding all the kids. This protocol was practised many times and never failed in the actual rocket alarm cases, of which there were quite a few.\nSo while this is far from ideal, it may be the most pragmatic and fastest way to getting the child to safety in an emergency.", "How on earth can the school reasonably put that responsibility on one of their pupils?\n\nNTA. The plan is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nDoes your son have an IEP or 504 plan in place? If so shouldn't those include an evacuation procedure specific to your child? I absolutely do not believe another minor aged student should be responsible for ensuring your child's safety during an emergency.  Regardless if the minor child was willing. I am guessing that minor child's parents would not be comfortable with their child being the responsible party either.

Some kids got stuck in the hallway, and there was confusion about what they were supposed to do, since the classrooms are not supposed to let anyone in. My English teacher later tried talking to the principal about it, and the principal told him, \u201cThe purpose of these drills isn\u2019t to make sure every kid lives. It\u2019s to make sure most of them live.\u201d\n\nSounds like your school has a similar attitude.", "NTA. Unfortunately \"plans\" like this or worse are common. If the school won't come up with a reasonable plan go up the food chain: email/call with the superintendent and showing up to the next school board meeting mad as hell.", "NTA at all. This sounds like the perfect way to ensure 2 fatalities.", "Your wife needs to look at this from a different perspective to realize that you are thinking of the well being of your son. You are and also thinking of other kids safety too. Even if it\u2019s true a kid could pick him up and run him out, would he actually do it if this scenario actually happened? I\u2019m not in school anymore and I would like to think if I still was, I\u2019d protect a friend, but the reality is, I do know I\u2019d be scared shitless. Maybe I would freeze, maybe I\u2019d run for my life, maybe I\u2019d try to hide. I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know what that kid would do. As selfish as it may sound (but shouldn\u2019t be if it\u2019s a fucking child) I don\u2019t think the first thing on my mind in a school shooting scenario is to save someone. She also needs to look at it this way- what if your kid wasn\u2019t in a wheelchair was the one offered to carry someone who is? Would your wife allow that? Don\u2019t think so. NTA.", "\"ROLL THEM OUT\" has me dyin", "NTA. As you said. It should not be the responsibility of another kid. Besides It is dangerous for both of the boys and other students. In case of emergency, while everyone is panicking, it is dangerous to pick others up and than walk among the other panicked students. Kid is going to drop yours. Others will fall over them. complete chaos. \nBesides. They are talking of one other kid? What if the kid is sick that day. Or kid is in another location. Wants to do his responsibility. Goes looking through the school which might be on fire and endangers himself? Or thinks. That is dangerous for me, and leaves? Which is what a kid should do. Without feeling guilty. In both cases your kid isn't helped.\n Or what if another student breaks a leg. And you have another wheelchair user. Does every wheelchair user get another student assigned to carry them out through the sea of panicked students?\n\nThe school needs a solid plan for wheelchair users. Depending on trained professionals, not children.", "Wife is TA for not thinking the scenario through and for emotionally manipulating you:\n\n\"wife is in tears saying that I want our son to just be forgotten if something happens\".\n\nYea.\n\nI am speechless, how can someone at their right mind come up with this kind of unrelated BS??\n\nAlso, school admins seem to be delusional about their \"emergency plan\". That's not a plan, that's a joke!!", "I'm a teacher and it is just wild to me that anyone thought this was an adequate plan. Like it literally endangers the lives of two students. If I was OP or the other student's parents, I would be out for blood at this incredibly negligent attitude.", "Yes, I bet their insurers will have a strong opinion on this.", "So many things could potentially go wrong with this plan. Either one being in the bathroom. Or having different classes. The other kid having some kind of injury. I can't believe the school has settled for this, to be honest.", "That touches my heart. Children seem to have more smarts and compassion than their educators.", "We have that policy for adults at work but there is one set of lifts that are on isolated system and they are located in heavy fire proofed rooms. Costs a lot of money to make that a good approach. Credit to the other pupils.", "Agreed..nta...dont let your wife say it could never happen ...look at nashville...", "I don't see how it's even legal to force the other kid to take on this resposibility.", "That\u2019s cool and appropriate for that setting. \n\nIt\u2019s would not be appropriate in any of the high schools local to me.  I don\u2019t know where the OP is, but where I live, 15 year olds go to different classes with different kids all day. Their emergency plans often do not involve each class calmly exiting under the guidance of a teacher. It depends on the emergency, type of campus, and time period- where do the kids go if an emergency occurs during class change? Which teacher is in charge? Messy. \n\nSadly, we also have active shooter plans that have kids basically running and hiding in various places. These plans often do not include kids with disabilities.\n\nA Gaza rocket attack response may not be the best model for this situation.  Response plans for different threats have to be tailored for the threat and the area.", "Kicking back a bad plan can often be better than keeping a bad plan. \n\nThe plan review and approval process exists for this reason- so people can review, and object, and work on the plan. \n\nDo not accept a bad plan thinking that it\u2019s better than no plan. There is no current emergency and there is time to come up with a better plan.", "Is this other child not allowed to take sick days? Has he trained as a firefighter? I can't imagine how anyone could possibly be on board with this! Keeping a sled by the stairs and shoving the kid down in it sounds like a safer and more reliable plan. (Safer, but still terrible).", "Right? Like, leave aside the ethics of volunteering someone, what if this kid they're riding their hopes on is injured in the emergency? Or was just not there that day to begin with? Really, it sounds like this plan is the school administrators just trying to make sure that *they* don't get blamed when OP's son almost inevitably gets left behind.", "Refusing this plan is making sure your son isn't forgotten in a real emergency. Even if child can carry your son, he isn't likely to have the emotional calm to do in time of distress. Your son needs a nominated adult at minimum. Kicking up a fuss now means something is in place if worst comes to worst.

That's an emergency measure for unexpected situations, not a contingency plan.", "And even if he did, is his plan to ALWAYS be near your son in case of emergency? They have to take all classes together, walk between classes together? Or is the idea that if there's a school shooter this kid will run, solo, through the halls, to wherever your son is at the time? \nThis is a terrible, terrible plan. I don't think the word \"plan\" could even apply to this awful idea.", "He is fine not to accept that responsibility.

Terrible plan.", "Also, do these two kids have exactly the same schedule for all of their classes? What if the other kid is in a class on the first floor and OP's kid is on the 3rd floor, is this 15yo expected to go up the stairs in the middle of a crisis? This sounds like a good way for two teenagers to die in an emergency.\n\nIf they can't bother to find a way to ensure that the wheelchair user is safely evacuated by trained adults then why can't they just re-arrange the classroom assignments so that all of his classes are on the ground floor? (This was the accommodation I got when I had spinal surgery as a graduate student and the building I took and taught most of my classes in was not handicap accessible past the first floor)", "u/throwawaymoonchild0, check out u/Motor_Business483 link in this tread.", "Exactly.

Hope the boy's parents also raise hell.", "If you haven\u2019t already, I would contact the other kids parents.
