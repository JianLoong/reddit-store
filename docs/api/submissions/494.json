I said I'll buy him a new umbrella but I am not paying for the car. to be clear, if the car was actually scratched and he didn't tell me he was 'fining' me I would probably pay for it, and I told him that. but if it did happen it would be a total accident that I couldn't have possibly foreseen and not my fault. Im against the principal of the thing and I don't think that a parent should be fining their child (granted I'm not a child but offspring just sounds weird ) for something like that. i have friends that ruined my shit before on accident and while I was pissed I didn't blame them for it. I welcomed compensation but I didn't demand it. I feel like it was wrong of my dad to talk to me like I'm not his daughter but some rando who scratched his car in broad daylight. then again I'm wondering if I'm just being entitled and if the whole eye for an eye thing is still applicable here. I get my dad's POV but I feel like this attitude is not the kind of attitude a parent should have for their kid. maybe that's just me and how I will be with my kids, and since I am an adult I should be held responsible. lmk what y'all think, I genuinely dunno if I'm in the wrong here.

You seem to be conceding that you probably did cause the damage. Yes, it was accidental, but that doesn't matter, it's still your fault.

You never even did so before the argument? You literally just started throwing down with each other without even knowing. Wtf?", "Multiple things here: you're 19, no longer a kid. Accidents are things that are people's fault for negligence, and if you scratched someone's car you are expected to pay for the repairs even if it's an accident.

When you\u2019re a parent, you can choose to be as generous and forgiving as you like, but you don\u2019t get to make that decision for anyone else. He\u2019s treating you like an adult and you\u2019re not used to it", "YTA.  Your dad's use of \"fine\" is weird, but a) you say you're an adult, and b) you acknowledge that it's good to be compensated when people damage your shit.  So behave like an adult and compensate your dad when you damage his shit.", "YTA\n\nYou caused the damage, even by accident, you need to be an adult and fix it. You already stated that you don't want to pay because of how your dad talked to you,  well sorry that is not a legitimate reason not to pay for your mistake.", "If you are just scared that it'll cost a lot and make up a silly reason why you won't pay, you aren't TA.\n\nIf you are pulling the \"I would have done it, but your attitude ruined it for me\" crap, you are TA.\n\nWhich one is it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not against paying him for it but I feel him completely denying the context, the fact that it was 5 am and dark as shit, that I couldn't have possibly prevented or foreseen it, and the fact that I'm his daughter is pretty hurtful cuz I would never do that to my kid. like if i hit it while driving recklessly or smt id be totally fine with paying him no questions asked. so I told him that if this is so important to him that he's going to \"fine\" me then I'm gonna pay him and then move out.", "ig I'm TA lol. i obviously don't wanna be paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket that's for sure, but I would if he was nicer about it.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
