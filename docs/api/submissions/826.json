Parents who feel entitled to free babysitting from their own relatives are bad enough. Expecting it from your new non-baby-daddy boyfriend's mom is a whole different level of messed up.", "Is it just me who finds it weird your son would date someone who's 9 months pregnant? And that a girl that pregnant is dating at all? Or that she's obviously just looking for a dad for the kid? No? Just me?", "NTA", "NTA. \"No\" is a complete sentence.\n\n\nHowever...

It\u2019s totally reasonable for you not to want to watch her child, for whatever reason.

I think it's inappropriate for her to even ask and is indicative for her feelings towards your son. Imo, kids shouldn't even be introduced to partners until you've been dating six months. And even then, I'm just talking about significant others (not their whole crew) and children who actually understand to some degree that that ain't their parent.", "NTA.

Don't get yourself entangled with this woman and her baby, because I seriously doubt they will be in your or your son's life for long.", "No, but you have a kind heart and I worry you'll blur your own boundaries from any guilt you might feel from saying no. You can absolutely clarify what you meant when you said you'd watch the baby on occasion, but make sure it's clear that you cannot babysit for more than a couple of hours if that's your plan. They don't need to know why not, and you deserve to have your boundaries respected.", "NTA - Even if you were biologically related to the kid you're not obliged to provide free child care. Hell, even if you WANTED to spend days with the baby it's a lot to ask. My mum offered to babysit my daughter 2 days a week but I turned her down initially because going from working 2.5 days a week for nearly 30 years back up to 4 days a week (she dropped to 2 days in work) is A LOT.

If they had another kid together, would you treat the two kids differently?", "Absolutely NTA for refusing to provide free childcare for 8 hours a day some days a week.", "NTA\nThe girlfriend isn\u2019t really an A H either, just a little weird.

I'm sure if a coworker left at 2pm to get \"a bite to eat\" and didn't return until 10 o'clock at night he would eventually realise there is a difference between \"sometimes\", several days a week and how long getting a bite to eat should take.

That physical attraction and those hormones and pheromones flying.  It might all seem like a dream right now, but that bubble is about to burst!  It's hard enough to keep a healthy and strongly built relationship together when a new baby enters the picture.  Couples have no time to nurture their own bond, when the baby commands every moment of the day.  That is what babies do.  \n\nI must say, I am a bit uncomfortable with your quickness in jumping right in to \"I am just learning how to live again....I have plans\" when I am really concerned that your son has jumped into a situation that seems to be over his head.

You also probably don\u2019t feel comfortable barely knowing this woman committing to several days a week watching her baby. That\u2019s 100% fine. I think you do need to think long and hard about at what point you would start to accept her and her baby as your family though. What if your son has met the love of his life and wants to adopt this baby as his own further down the line? You can\u2019t keep pushing her and her daughter away in your life if they\u2019re going to be important parts of your son\u2019s life potentially. Because you could very quickly become TA mother in law who refuses to acknowledge her son\u2019s partner and child because the baby wasn\u2019t his, even if he doesn\u2019t care. Yes right now as this is early in the relationship it is very awkward. But if you keep them at arms length forever then he won\u2019t want to have you involved in their collective life together. \n\nI don\u2019t think this woman was TA for asking. As you said you\u2019d mentioned in passing babysitting. Even if you meant occasionally, you did offer. You raised your son as a single mom so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re not qualified. And I\u2019m pretty sure your son encouraged it at some point in an effort to solve the problem for her. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s pouting or trying to make him think badly of you because you said no. I think they\u2019re just desperate. She\u2019s financially supporting her child and if she can\u2019t go back to work fully then she can\u2019t do that. Day care can be scary sometimes or unaffordable by some and I think they were just trying to find people they thought may be able to help out.

What good parent in their right mind trusts someone who is practically a complete stranger with their newborn child?!\n\nMale, female, gender doesn't matter. This whole situation is a huge red flag.", "It's crazy but this shit happens so consistently here. So many posts here are judged off information pulled out of nowhere or people that project there own lives into them. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with making comparisons but to actually say \"well it happened this way to my sisters best friends brother so it's gonna happen to this guy too\" is getting ridiculously common around here.", "***UPDATE***\n\nThank you everyone for your suggestions and concerns. I talked with my son just a little bit ago. I let him know I am available for \"date\" nights and that I would need to be asked a few days in advance.\n\nI also told him how weird it is for me to be considered grandma at this point, and I will need time to adjust to that. He understands. \n\nHe is adamant on continuing his relationship, no matter how strange it may be. He is fully understanding of things that could happen down the line. He is writing up a contract that he is going to sign and she is going to sign, and have notarized saying he is not financially responsible for the child. Hopefully that will prevent any legal complications in the future if they go their own ways. \n\nAll I can do is continue doing what I have been and hope the best for everyone!", "Pregnant people and single mothers are allowed to date", "Nah. Not everything in life is a fucking scam.", "Are pregnant people not allowed to date? What about single mothers is it ok for them to date or are they just looking for a dad too? Who care what her baby status is if the two of them are in love.", "There's nothing wrong with dating someone who's pregnant, or with someone who's pregnant dating.\n\nIs someone who has a born kid not allowed to date? They're probably looking for a parent for their kid too.", "Calling her your kid\u2019s \u201cgrandma\u201d after knowing these people a month is also kooky-dukes.", "Yea unfortunately in some states him even stepping in as thr father figure can result in him being forced to pay child support if they break up. I know he thinks this is forever but he's 21 he needs to walk a fine line here.", "Gramma here. I watch my sweet granddaughter part time and it\u2019s a LOT. Just keep saying no. You deserve a life of your own. I hope your son knows what he\u2019s in for. NTA", "She clearly wants a daddy for the kid. Your son may not realise that since she isn't asking him to be financially responsible for her *yet*, but if they're in his place all the time, it's pretty obvious. Not to mention saying you are \"grandma\". That is for you to decide, not them. Unless they got married, you wouldn't be, and even then, it would be entirely your choice how much time you wanted to spend with the child. Some people love being grandparents. Some are just happy to be empty nesters and live their own lives. Neither approach is wrong. You'd be perfectly in the right to wash your hands off the kid completely if you wished.", "You ever seen My Name is Earl? Joy found herself a baby daddy too.", "it takes a special kind of dummy", "Is your brother still with her? If not, is he now paying child support since he signed the birth certificate?", "And she got to find that dummy!!!", "Worst part is that he probably is doing it unconsciously cause he knows how hard it was for his mom to raise him alone\u2026 so a defense mechanism", "He left her. She stole a bunch of his stuff and poisoned his Koi pond in retaliation.\n\nHe was going to keep paying child support, but she was making visitation hard on him. He refused to pay unless he got visitation, so she went to the biodad and they did a DNA test and my brother relinquished rights. He was really upset because he did love the child.", "What a crap person (the woman, not your brother, just to be clear). I despise people like this. I hope your brother finds someone worthy of his time and attention."]}
