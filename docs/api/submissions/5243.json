Assuming both of you would want to continue living in the home you made together, the sale of your husbands' home would not only cover funeral and burial expenses, but be a huge offset in transitioning from a dual-income family to a single income person.\n\nFWIW: there is a concept called \"Life Estates\" that let you will the property to someone, but gives your co-habitator (spouse, roomate, whatever) the legal right to live there; when you die they receive the deed but it is restricted from any sale.  When they move or die, the state then gives your beneficiaries an unrestricted deed.", "Really depends on their financial circumstances. We don't really have the info necessary, but the moves kind of mirror my own parents.\n\nThey realized in 7 to 10 they would probably be nearing exhausting their savings and be on fixed income SS and medicade basically, with nothing to pass on to their kids/grandkids.\n\nThey decided to exelerate that process and turn their savings into fixed assets in a trust that would be safe from medicade clawback after 5 years.\n\nAs they were on fixed income now, my brothers and I picked up the ongoing maintenance taxes of the hard assets in the trust. (As well as other help).\n\nIt's not really that uncommon in the US.\n\nIt's also possible he just doesn't want assets he paid into to go to a man he barely knows.", "Fair. Though my issue is that I never asked for any of these things my parents just decided on what was more convenient for them as they move around a lot. In my opinion since they did all these things on their own, it's now their responsibility to do the paperwork to cover their butts as well. I am perfectly willing to do the will once the legal insurance kicks in in January but I can sign a document they draw up in the meantime if they are worried. I just feel like I'm getting railroaded here with a bunch of responsibility I didn't want I the first place.", "Considering the down payment my parents left they have some vested interest in the property. I also never asked my husband for any assistance with renovation or mortgage payment, he is right now receiving all the benefit and none of the liability as he has a property he owns and is renting out. From a pure financial consideration my parents have more \"right\" to it.", "OP's husband owns his own home in his own name, and OP owns the home that they currently I've in together, which SHE paid for with help from her parents. If OP dies, her husband can just move back to his own home. Her parents want the house that she and THEY paid for to stay in their family, rather than the OP's husband end up with 2 houses, only one of which he has any financial stake in.", "Such is life in America. The government will pay your medical expenses, including nursing home. You just can't have any money or assets for them to do it.", "In the US, failure to pay is probably one of the harder ways to lose a house. A lot of the \u201808 crash foreclosures just got put back on the market this year.", "Yes, pretty much this.", "They didn't put your name on a house without your cooperation. So, if you didn't want that responsibility, the time to take that stand was back then.", "Oh, now I get it. You\u2019re pissed at your parents for the \u2018bunch of responsibility\u2019 and you\u2019re sitting in the catbird seat sticking it to them. Yeah. Y.TA.", "Was the down payment a gift or an investment? Because either way you own most of the house, and so does your husband through his marriage with you. \n\nI guess I just don\u2019t understand your willingness to throw your husband completely to the side in favor of your parents. They have one house already, why do they need the one that you\u2019re living in willed to them as well? Does your husband share the profit from renting his property with you as well?", "That pretty much seals the YTA part unfortunately. Your parents basically codified your inheritance, probably a few hundred thousand dollars based on a house value and down payment as long as they get to live in the house until then.\n\nNot unreasonable they'd want to be protected when you've said they barely know your husband.", "I see your perspective but my dad tends to give me things and yells at me a lot. So I in turn start to resent everything he gives me. I also don't need any of it, I have a very well paying job, ultimately all of it is not how I would prefer to live my life, I am a minimalist, I would love very few things, just my one house that me and my husband live in and a lot less emotional strings to things.\n\nI get that this is very ivory castle for a lot of people, I am very privileged. But everyone has the way they want to live their lives and mine is to have enough money to retire on when I get to retirement age, that's basically tir. I'm just so tired of being yelled at for pretty much my entire childhood and part of my adult life.\n\nEdit: and before you say, well just give him all that stuff back, he refuses to accept anything and he would never talk to me again if I sold any of it. I would prefer we are still on good terms, he's not all bad just emotionally kind of angry a lot. It's not cut and dry.", "Their reasoning is it would end up \"outside the family\" in the situation where I die, my husband gets remarried, has kids, and gives the house to them. Which is not an unreasonable train of thought.\n\nEdit: I should mention I have a brother who is planning to have kids.", "That's totally fine, I came here to find out if I am the AH here so I can determine what to do next. Sounds like it's on me to do the will right now, at least in some small capacity so it's legal and filed, and revise it in January to be more comprehensive.", "I still don\u2019t understand it, but that isn\u2019t really important I guess. I\u2019d sit down and talk with your husband before you sign anything. He has a right to your property, especially if you comingle finances. Talk with him, then a lawyer. The new year is almost here, your parents can wait for you to do your due diligence", "NTA. But if I where you, I'd give them their house they live in and leave the house you live in to your husband or one of your kids if he passes first. Your parents are getting greedy with your own assets you are paying for. Giving you a down payment doesn't negate the fact that you're still paying hundreds of thousands of dollars over 30 years for that house and it belongs to you, not them. They don't get to demand both properties from you. You're well in your right to not leave them either house if that's your wish as well since they demanded it be in your name and you're paying taxes and homeowners insurance.\n\nDon't let them bully you into ignoring your own husband and any future kids in your will. Your responsibility is ultimately for them, Not just your parents.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Invest in a good accidental death and disability insurance, as generous as you can afford and would cover all your debts. If you become disabled you get a payout. Your beneficiary would also get a payout upon your death. It's what I have and it gives me piece of mind.", "OP says her husband owns a separate house, in his name only, and she owns the house they currently live in, that she and her parents paid for. So if she died, her parents would get their own house back (that they paid for but is currently in her name) plus her house (that she pays for, with help from her parents but no help from her husband), and her husband would keep the house that he owns in his own name.", "This is no joke. Medicaid will take EVERYTHING if one or both of them has to go into care. My grandma had to live on a shoestring budget when she had to put my grandpa in a nursing home because they took every asset she had. And when she\u2019d get a social security raise, they\u2019d even take that. It\u2019s smart they\u2019re thinking ahead here and OP needs to do the same.", "That still doesn\u2019t explain why she wouldn\u2019t leave her husband something. Presumably, when the husband dies he will leave the OP the house that is in his own name. If he wouldn\u2019t, then it\u2019s fair that she doesn\u2019t leave him one either.", "Medicaid? I thought this was outside the U.S.\n\nI'm aware of protecting the property from being taken for nursing hone care. My aunt had her property deeded to me and my cousin, except she still paid the taxes and bills.\n\nOP did not explain it was to avoid the home being taken. She said it was for her to pay taxes and utilities which make no sense.", "Yep. Medicade wouldn't take their house immediately, but as soon as the estate was being determined its the governments."]}
