I'm okay with it as long as it isn't after 5:30PM and not longer than one hour, since it makes your night sleep worse, or you can't fall asleep at all after you previously had a longer nap. Her bedtime is 9PM cause me and her father think that her sleep is very important. She has a history of waking up at 3AM to study, since she procrastinates a lot and doesn't do it in the afternoon.\n\nShe says she really needs a nap to be able to study or concentrate, otherwise she's really tired. I told her to sleep immediately after school (she usually comes home around 4PM)but she said she can't always fall asleep immediately after school. \n\nIf she sleeps when she's not allowed to, I gently wake her up. She always gets incredibly irritated. Today she yelled at me,  called me controlling and said she's holding herself not to explode right now (I can't say what exactly what she said cause I would get banned) \n\nShe said she couldn't even fall asleep (today after school, while she was trying to nap)cause of sensory issues (she's autistic, high functioning) and I'm already interrupting her. \n\nEdit: I should probably mention that she tends to be very self destructive, that's why we think it's better to control her a bit more. She also has limited screentime since she used to be addicted to gaming/social media, and not doing anything for school. She has an above average IQ but didn't care about most things. She still has trouble studying the things she finds boring, she said she can't concentrate. We forced her to go to therapy when she was around 17, she doesn't go anymore.\n\nEdit: we let her have her own sleep schedule before and she caused herself depression \n\nEdit: getting up at 3 am was her old schedule, she went to sleep around 10/11pm. She admitted it that 5 hours of sleep weren't enough for her, but she still didn't wanna study after school. The only way was to wake up at 3am...\n\nEdit: she only has autism diagnosed, not ADHD.\n\nEdit: the fact that's she's an adult by law doesn't mean that she's mature enough to make her own decisions. She'd ruin her life and body if we let her\n\n(Using a new account for anonymity)", "created_utc": 1679418013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xn07b/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_sleep/", "score": 455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, your daughter can\u2019t force herself to go to bed by nine. A bedtime isn\u2019t helpful in this scenario and could actually be making things worse.\n\nIf she needs extra help organizing and prioritizing tasks then help her with that. Stay on top of her when it comes to school work to minimize her panicking at three in the morning.

Actually, it demanded it.\n\nI also always got in trouble for \"procrastinating\" with homework and other responsibilities. Turns out, I had undiagnosed ADHD and autism which made school incredibly difficult and especially exhausting. Maybe look into it a little to see it it sounds like your daughter? If not, yeah dude, school is exhausting. Every year it gets more competitive, schools keep imposing more requirements, and it's like working a full time job, going home, and having to do hours of additional work on top of it.

You have no legal or moral grounds for controlling her.  As an adult, she has the right and the responsibility to make decisions for herself.  When she sleeps or does not sleep are the most basic decisions.  Whether she chooses to spend a good part of her day on social media is her business.  Frankly, it's pretty normal, so I doubt that she had an addiction, especially one that warranted an intervention from you.  If you insist on forcing your will on her, she will not learn to manage herself.  She'll end up resenting you and will more than likely cut you out of her life.

And a **9pm** bedtime for an **18 year old** is absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019m not surprised she has blown up at you if this is the way you treat her because you ***are*** being controlling. How are you preparing her for an independent life after school by treating her like a child and giving her no autonomy over even the smallest things? As a parent now is the time you should be guiding your daughter and encouraging her to make sensible choices for herself.
