An aunt talking with her niece is no reason to break a promise just because you don't like what she said.  Get mad at her if you want, but be honest and don't cheat someone out of their wages/enticement after the service is provided just because an extraneous issue came up.  Imagine telling a restaurant you're not paying because they served the wrong meal to the table next to you.  What???  Exactly it has nothing to do with the meal nor does it have anything to do with the fact that your sister drove 30 minutes each way and she did it because you offered her money to do it.  So do it.", "YTA.  These are two different things.  She should be paid for her time as you agreed.  The conversation she had with your daughter is another issue and should be addressed separately.", "YTA.\n\nShe went above and beyond what you had asked. \n\nHer conversation with your daughter and you about weight and eating habits are a distinct issue from paying for services rendered.", "You had an agreement with your sister that wasn't contingent on anything other than her checking on your kid.

You agreed to give her money.  She went above and beyond.

There is a lot of space between a doctor telling someone they need to lose weight and a nosy aunt being judgmental. There is also a lot of space between a 17 year old not helping with the dishes and them actually being lazy. \n\nUltimately I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely none of your sister\u2019s business, and it\u2019s not remotely appropriate for her to shame your daughter in any way regardless of her actual weight. If your daughter is actually overweight then that is something you deal with personally, and your sister doesn\u2019t need to be involving herself in that.

It could also be an indication of depression. \n\nMaybe there is something wrong and maybe your sister is right to be concerned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr maybe your sister is an insecure asshole unloading her own self esteem issues and insecurities on too your daughter.\n\nAlso you are NTA for not paying her, because you should not have to pay her at all, she is a grown woman with her own job, spending time with her niece should be a privilege, not a monetary transaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m assuming your sister meant no actual harm but wanted to be upfront and truthful in order to help your daughter. Sometimes brutal honesty is the kick in the behind everyone needs. Sometimes it\u2019s not taken as helpful as this thread shows. Other times it\u2019s not what was said but how it was said. After you all cool off talk it over. But also be honest and consider what was truthful. Also you and your sister need to consider the maturity level of your daughter  in order to have an effective conversation.

Weight excess causes a ton of health issues especially later on in life - I'm sure everyone is very well aware of this. \n\nWhy is it so bad for an aunt to point out a health-related aspect of a young niece, your sister clearly cares for your daughter and her well-being. \n\nWeight is a delicate issue for most people, but when it's a question of health - especially for a teenager - then there shouldn't be any ifs, ands or buts - it should be a *top priority*. \n\nYes, easier said than done, but at least your daughter has people in her life who will *tell her the truth* and care about her enough to do so. \n\nTake it from someone who's struggled with some weight gain in the past (luckily, in my case it never was excessive or health-impairing) - you know who you should be pissed at? \n\nYour daughter's fit friends who most likely tell her she's gorgeous. That being overweight is 'not even a thing', just a visual perception that only fatphobic people have, that she should eat whatever she wants, whenever she wants.

Let's get you some more pizzas and nuggets, and this 2 liter of Mountain Dew is really delish as well ... while they hit the gym and keep track of macros with the rigor of a diamond merchant counting his carats. \n\n*Those* are the people you should worry about, not someone who expresses concern about something that is clearly affecting the niece she obviously cares about.", "He has stated in other comments she is over weight and that he himself is a normal weight.", "Cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it.
