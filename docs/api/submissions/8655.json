Trust me, you didn't go too far.  IMO You didn't go far enough, but there's still time to cut contact with these people and work on YOU.", "Truth can hurt. That's not the truth's fault.\n\nNTA.

Pushing for marriage to the man who knocked up her 17 year old daughter is ... straight up abusive.\n\nSo her feelings are hurt.  Oh no.

You off because of her religion since you were going to be having the kid at a wedlock is not her fault.

She needs to realize that it's not your responsibility to save them. They hadn't put themselves in a financially stable position in case of emergencies and that's on them. And secondly she doesn't get to decide or tell you what you deserve in financial payments and what is more than enough money.\n\nAs for your subjects question yes, you're still the a******  not because you were mean to your mom. No, you're the a****** because you haven't take responsibility for your own s*** and because you consider raising your kids on your own now to be a ruined life . You're going to be making $120,000 a year raising the kids which is certainly doable even with five. I understand that it will be difficult raising so many on your own but that was your choice. Not your mom's as well. So yeah she didn't ruin your life, if you consider raising your kids on your own a ruined life, then you the a******", "YTA you opened your legs over and over and got 5 kids.

Had her mother given her autonomy, I doubt she\u2019d be a 25 year old single mother of 5. Honestly I think her mom got off light.", "I don't understand where OP might have went \"too far\". Can you explain it ?", "Thats all you can say when she was impregnated at 16 and forced to marry a grown man?", "OP did not need to say \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have kids!\u201d To make her point that her mother has been harmful to her life.

Taking it to \u201cyou  ruined my life, I shouldn\u2019t even be a mother rn\u201d is going to a whole different convo that is no longer about the money.

We don't know, because OP doesn't say, that she is in one of the 4 states where you can't put a child up for adoption without parental consent if you're a minor so again, can't say whether she had a choice or not.\n\nI don't think she's the AH here, I really don't, but I do think people should take responsibility for the decisions they have made. She's an adult now and should be able to have an adult conversation about the impact it has had on her life without flying off the handle or making sweeping statements like \"you ruined my life\".", "From the post, the mother married her off young to someone who was domestically abusive, because she'd got pregnant and because the man (adult, pursuing a teenager) was well off. Her comments say the husband was adamantly against birth control - a good way to keep a woman dependant and unable to leave, and she also says she loves her children, they gave her the push to leave in the end.\n\nThey definitely don't need to hear the comment about adoption though, it would destroy them.", "In an alternative reality, she stays married for 2 more years and has a 6th child - are we mourning that hypothetical and possible 6th child?

Yeah preferably the kids never learn about it, but to say \"since the child is innocent\" makes sound like giving the baby to two willing potential parents would be a form of punishment.", "And if I'm doing my math right eith OP beeing 25 and eldest kid beeing 8 they did not take care of her for 18 years  like they should have.", "Partial comment stolen from u/unluckysupernova", "This user is a bot.

Which she could have easily said without including \u201cI should have given my child up for adoption.\u201d There is no need for her to possibly destroy her children\u2019s lives because her life was destroyed.", "If her mother is truly abusive, she is absolutely at risk for repeating it to the kids. \n\nBut regardless, what I said was a warning to make sure she doesn\u2019t say that kind of thing again with the kids present, or to anyone who might be cruel enough to repeat it.  \n\nIn no way was I saying we must mourn the unborn potential future child, and your taking it there is odd.
