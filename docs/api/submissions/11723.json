He is incredible, and I can\u2019t believe that I found someone so wonderful. His family is generally very sweet, but lately his mom has been making me a little uncomfortable, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong for handling it this way. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9s mom \u201cDebra\u201d is coming to a bridal shower that my parents are throwing in several weeks. Debra hasn\u2019t gotten to interact with my parents too much since they live so far apart, so this will only be the 3rd or 4th time they\u2019re together. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 was on the phone with his mom, just catching up. He had the phone on speaker while he was cleaning his kitchen, and I was in the room but not a part of the call, as I was working on my laptop. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 asked Debra if she was excited to come to the shower, and she said yes, because she wanted to hear all the \u201cgossip\u201d. He asked her what she meant, and she clarified that she wanted to hear all the gossip from my parents about me - all the \u201cembarrassing and bad things I had probably done that they didn\u2019t know about.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 laughed, and said that I didn\u2019t have anything to hide, besides maybe a few typical embarrassing stories. Debra just responded with \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that\u201d, and they moved on. \n\nAfter they hung up, I told my fianc\u00e9 that I thought his mom\u2019s comment was kind of weird (she didn\u2019t say anything else she was excited for about the shower), and it made me uncomfortable. He said that she probably didn\u2019t mean anything by it, and it was just a joke. I told him that I felt like it was a weird joke to make, and that my parents had never said anything of the sort about him. He agreed, but still insisted it was no big deal. Here\u2019s where I might be TA: I texted my mom later that night and told her what Debra had said. My mom agreed that this was weird, and reassured me that she didn\u2019t have anything bad to say about me even if Debra did ask. \n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 that I had texted my mom, and he got upset at me - saying that Debra would be embarrassed if she knew. I said that if it was really a joke, she had no reason to be embarrassed. Now he\u2019s upset, and my sister (who I also \u201cwarned\u201d) also says that it wasn\u2019t a big deal, so I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m TA for telling my mom and potentially damaging her view of Debra. Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not worried about silly/embarrassing stories, hence why my fianc\u00e9 told Debra that that was probably all she would hear - when she said \u201cwe\u2019ll see about that\u201d, it made me feel like she wanted to hear things that were more personal to me. I may be overreacting - her and I have had some mild tension in the past (mostly wedding related things) and that\u2019s made me extra cautious around her.", "created_utc": 1678207749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l4f6n/aita_for_taking_my_future_mils_joke_seriously_and/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why be embarrassed if it\u2019s not a big deal?  You\u2019re right in that regard, absolutely. The \u201cwe\u2019ll see about that\u201d makes it weirder. Like she\u2019s desperate for some tea on how awful you were as a kid. \n\nI hate comments like that. It\u2019s weird, inappropriate, and people need to stop letting their parents get away with it. They\u2019re not entitled to your dirty little secrets that only your parents know. They\u2019re not entitled to information about your childhood, or embarrassing stories. It\u2019s always been weird. You have every right to make sure there won\u2019t be shit said about you. \n\nNTA.", "I mean, I would take Debra's comment more along the lines of her getting to know you beyond the typical facade that the partner of their child might put on. It sounded like playful ribbing and its something a lot of parents bond over. \n\nNow that being said, I don't think there was anything wrong with you telling your mom or sister about the conversation if you were feeling uncomfortable or worried about what your mom might say.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhile I only know what you've posted, that sounds really ominous to me as well.  As in Debra will actively be **looking** for nasty things about you.  Perhaps to convince your fianc\u00e9 to dump you, for all I know.   Granted, I don't know vital things like her voice tone, pitch, speed of speech --- things we all instinctively use to know someone's intent.  These may make the statement far less severe or moreso.\n\nHowever, I find it weird that your fianc\u00e9 is upset over your telling your mom and sister about this.   So I'd consider him the AH here.  I don't consider Debra the AH because we don't know her actual **intent** here.  For all we know, she may joke like that all the time.  \n\nThe big problem here is you don't know Debra well and she doesn't know you well.  So there's no real foundation of mutual trust there.  With that foundation, playful teasing and jokes are known to be harmless. But, when you hardly know someone, the same exact teasing and jokes can easily cause severe rifts.", "This really depends on FMIL's tone. That's a pretty standard joke IMO, and if she didn't sound cruel when she said it, you would be the asshole", "NTA\n\nShe's embarassed because now people know she wanted to embarass you? I'm really not getting her logic.\nIt was definitely a weird thing to say. Your fiance should have given her that feedback when she said it. Hopefully she would have taken the note, apologized, and there wouldn't have been a need to warn others of her bizarre scheme.\nAlso, claiming it was a \"joke\" is not ok. Ask your fiance to explain the joke. He can't because it isn't funny, there's no joke there. Jokes are funny. It's always wise to be very careful with people who claim unfunny, hurtful things are jokes.", "NTA", "NTA.  Nervous reaction.  All of this anxiety will pass after the wedding.  Just my thoughts for you consideration.", "NTA - that is not normal. Normally it is parents showing the future spouse funny/cute/mildly embarrassing pictures from when their child was young. So her wanting to get personal juicy gossip about you from someone else has created an uncomfortable situation.", "NTA. I have a very, shady, MIL. It started w small comments and eventually she turned into the MIL from hell and I moved 7300km away. \n\nMy advice. Keep your guard up. Let it be known you and your fiance don't keep things from each other. And instruct everyone at your shower to be cordial but not give any info. \n\nI feel like she's looking for ammo to use later.  And her comments when she thought you weren't in earshot proves that. \n\n\nFYI - I'll admit, my advice is jaded, because of the abuse and gaslighting. It took my husband YEARS to see the unhealthy dynamics of his family. Now we're a united front, but it wasn't always that way.", "NTA.

He's over reacting, you can talk to your mom about whatever you want.", "I can see why this made you uncomfortable or caused uncertainty given you might not know her enough and or maybe she has put out some vibes before. \n\nSo I can understand why you asked your mom. \n\nThen again, I can also imagine future MIL meaning this more in a humorous way, as in stupid little things that you can laugh about, like kids misspelling words and those kind of things. \n\nI'm going for NA. It's okay to ask you mom about how you feel about that and if there is indeed any weird vibes from future MIL then it's good your parents know and can respond in the right way. Other than that weddings are stressful and there can be a lot of uncertainty about whether you feel accepted by your mom and I'll just place this on there. Only time can tell, the good thing is, your husband seems to be on your side so I'm just going to wish you a lovely celebration!", "A lesson in here regarding speaker phones.", "I think Debra\u2019s comments could have been lighthearted, like she can\u2019t wait to hear silly childhood stories about you. Or they could have been a bit on the mean side. Her tone would have a lot to do with how they were meant. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think it was wrong for you to ask your mom about it. I see that as more of you going to your mom for perspective and advise which is what I would have done too. I think your fianc\u00e9 is kind of overreacting and I\u2019d hope your mom and sister wouldn\u2019t call Debra out on anything or make her feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve complained to my mom and sister about my MIL and they\u2019ve never made her uncomfortable or betrayed my confidence. \n\nNTA", "No one is TA right now, but I would still (respectfully) keep an eye on MIL. You overheard that \u201cjoke\u201d, which means that, whether it was actually funny or not, it was something that she didn\u2019t expect you to hear in the first place. Most Monster-in-laws don\u2019t show their actual deviousness to their kid, but will behave insanely when she\u2019s with Just You. Don\u2019t keep bringing up this one comment, and don\u2019t tell MIL you heard, just make sure this is the one and only comment. Alerting your mom has already made it easy for the two of you to shut MIL down if she does start saying weird shit at the shower.", "YTA. This oversensitive subreddit will back you up, but you are being ridiculous. The only possible reason i can think of for your reaction to such a mild, throwaway comment is that you have something you are REALLY afraid of her and/or your fiance finding out about. I am unable to fathom what could go through a person's mind after hearing that comment and actually calling people to make sure they don't say anything. That is crazy levels of paranoia and honestly just being overdramatic and attention seeking. \n\n\n\n\nOr like I said, you are worried about something being exposed...", "NTA - also not a pattern to repeat in the future (deal with mom and mil separately).", "NTA. What you did shouldn\u2019t have been an issue if it\u2019s a joke. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t a joke. Your fianc\u00e9 knows this. That\u2019s why he was upset. He was ok with MIL embarrassing you, but not the other way around? And you told to protect yourself!\n\nIf your mother is Anything like my mother, she would be telling the worst stories for free. Once, during Mother\u2019s Day ( I am not a mother) she told everyone the story of my worse car accident. \n\nNTA. But don\u2019t feel bad. You did nothing wrong.", "I feel like this is just a game of telephone, I've heard people make similar jokes about meeting other people's families, its not that deep. But its like, when you repeat a joke removing context and tone it starts to sound serious.", "I don't know if you're the a-hole for telling your mom, but what she said isn't really that weird. Just playful banter.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think MIL meant anything by it. But it would really depend on the tone of the joke. But I also disagree with a lot of people here with the telling your mom part. Asking your mom not to share embarrassing stories about you is pretty normal. And not at all over the top. And I don\u2019t get your fianc\u00e9 playing both sides of the \u201cit\u2019s just a joke\u201d.

In turn she told my mom how my hubby stripped down to nothing and ran around  the house (he was 2) when the minister and his wife were over for dinner... those are what she's wanting to hear. \n You're being waaaaaaay too sensitive about this and it's put you into the AH category.", "YTA.

Did you actually expect your mom would say anything damaging (as opposed to the standard \"when she was 3 she tried to paint the dog blue\" funny stories)?
