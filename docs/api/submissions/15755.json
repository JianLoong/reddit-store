She was fine, she was in the hospital with the doctors doing her treatment.

I didn't think of that", "The mortality rate for septic shock is 40% so considering he was immediately sent to the icu he was very sick. The chances of him dying were pretty high and his husband left and sent all the calls to voicemail. If this was my brother I would be pissed on his behalf as well.", ">Why let that money go to waste?\n\nI can't believe you typed that.\n\nHow can you enjoy a vacation when your husband is DYING in an ICU? How can you enjoy a vacation without knowing if you'll ever see him again, without wanting to be there to say goodbye?\n\n>And besides, is your BIL a doctor? Would having him there at the hospital do anything medically for your brother?\n\nThis argument is so stupid and not consistent with reality that we only see it on Reddit. His HUSBAND, the person he supposedly loves almost died and he wasn't even in the country. Who the fuck cares if he isn't a doctor, if he cared about his husband at all he would have wanted to be there.\n\n>I've never understood the whole \"your family member is in the hospital, drop everything you are doing and sit in a waiting room for days on end!\" mentality. \n\nI know nothing about you so I'll just say this: when you love someone you get so worried when their lives is in danger that this is what you want to do.", "Unfortunately that is what I was thinking too.", "My father started this while the husband was gone.  They just needed a couple more things from him.  As for the husband,  he hasn't really talked to us since we left.  When we came over this morning,  hubby wasn't there.", "Do not apologize! He left his spouse in the ICU & turned off his phone. There is ZERO excuse for that. It is irrelevant if your brother discussed it or not!!", "Hopefully this is a misunderstanding.", "I hope so.  Either way, I'll support my brother and follow his lead from here out."]}
