She was fine, she was in the hospital with the doctors doing her treatment.

Don't worry yourself about what anyone's friends think. If these people all think that the cool thing to do when your spouse is in the hospital with sepsis is to just call \"his\" family to be there and deal with it while you disappear for no reason there and make yourself purposely unavailable they are all trash.

You called us to tell us and then left without a word. We didn't know where you where or what had happened to you. It shouldn't be hard to understand that it didn't make a good impression.

Heart attack?- what if they have kids and the kids get super sick? His option seems to be that as long as brother (or who ever) doesn't die its no big deal.

OP made an excellent point asking what's the point of being married if your spouse is not going to give a damn if you're on your deathbed?!\n\nI'm upset and disturbed by this story. OP I truly hope your brother recovers soon and when he does divorces the husband", "Actually I am going to go full AH and expect to be voted down a million karma, but I need to agree with the OP's brother's spouse on the difference between gay marriage.\n\nOP is NTA but I would leave it at that and not recommend digging into their relationship further because there is a huge difference between being a gay man in his 60s and a gay man under 40.  I have two people in my family that are gay/lesbian under 40 and have spouses they met in college that are happily committed relationships.  I wish them good fortune in the future.\n\nI also lost a family member whose father disowned him and died of an illness similar to your brother with only his spouse while in a trailer park.  The difference was the older family member would have been around 60 now.  There is a difference between growing up in an era where you could be killed for being gay like Milk or Adam from Wyoming, being persecuted during the AIDs epidemic or losing your job like Ellen for being gay and being gay now.  It was much harder for gay men to find spouses before the 2000s.  And now, now nobody is going to swipe right on Grindr for an old gay dude unless they want something from them.  And no gay old dudes are going to get a younger gay guy unless they are likely a sugar daddy.\n\nSo I am going while hog on saying you are not the AH for wanting someone to care about your brother, but I am betting that your brother knows exactly what he got when he was picking his spouse because if he is an older gay guy, he would rather be married than die alone.  AND NO MATTER how much you are mad his spouse ditched him in the hospital, at least he had a spouse to ditch him in the hospital.
