{"id": 13596, "submission_id": "1270es2", "title": "AITA for not wanting to make my future brother-in-law a groomsman?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 \\[25F\\] and I \\[29M\\] are from the same hometown, but we never went to school together. I graduated high school the year before she started at the same high school. I did, however, go to school with her older brother \\[30M\\]. Her brother was a bully to my during our entire school careers. He made fun of me for being fat and nerdy, he would call me racist names (They're Italian and I'm Indian, so he had a lot to say about that), and he was just overall terrible to me.\n\nI figured once we graduated, I'd never see him again, and for the most part, I was right. I went off to college out of state, and then ended up going to graduate school as well. During my first year in grad school, I was a TA for a class, and I noticed one of the girls who I thought was very smart and very pretty, but obviously I couldn't go out with her because of our positions. Well, right after the semester ended, I ran into her at a coffee shop off campus and we chatted for a bit. She ended up asking me for my number, and then she actually asked me out a few weeks later. We've been together ever since.\n\nAt the start of our relationship, I had no idea who her brother was. They have a very common American last name, so it's not like that was going to do anything. Eventually, we figured out we were from the same town and we went to the same high school, at which point she asked me if I knew her brother and I said I knew of him, but not well. I probably should've told her what her brother had done to me at that point, but I was too embarrassed, so I kept it hidden.\n\nThings really came to a head when she introduced me to her family a year later. Her brother actually called me by the same nickname he liked to use to bully me, and then made a few semi-insulting remarks towards me again. My fianc\u00e9 (girlfriend at the time) noticed and called him out on it, and he just explained that that was how we always talked before. I told her it wasn't a big deal since I didn't want to cause any drama.\n\nWe got engaged three months ago. Recently, we were talking about wedding plans and stuff with her family, and he asked me when I was going to ask him to be a groomsman and if I was doing anything special. I deflected, and after the call I asked her about it. She explained that her brother expected to be made a groomsman, since she was making my little sister and her SIL bridesmaids and he made her a bridesmaid in his wedding. I told her about why I didn't like her brother, and she said that she understood, but it was still right to make him a groomsman. I said no again, and she got pretty upset about it and said her parents were going to be mad. I was also annoyed, so I texted her family group chat to say that he wasn't going to be one under any circumstance, and now they're all made at me. AITA?\n\n**Edit:** I texted my BIL and told him that I felt like I deserved an apology from him. He said he had \"nothing to be sorry for\". I told him that I didn't even want him at the wedding and the only reason he was going to be there was because he had to be. Everyone is even more angry with me now. I know I shouldn't have said that, but he really upset me with that. I feel like I have to fix this.\n\n**Edit 2:** So I showed my fianc\u00e9 this post and she had an actual panic attack reading through the comments. She kept repeatedly asking me if I was going to break up with her and then she kept saying sorry. I think the comments telling me to reconsider the relationship and consider whether or not I wanted to actually have a future with her really got to her. She's yelling at her parents on the phone right now. I have no idea whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.\n\n**Edit 3:** So my fianc\u00e9's parents decided they wanted to talk to me after my fianc\u00e9 yelled at them. Her mom apologized straight away and said that she had no idea we had such a history, and although she believed his comments had always been wrong, she thought I was okay with it. Her dad also apologized but tried to talk about how family was more important and I should let this all be in the past. I said I couldn't, and he started getting really angry at me, and now all three of them are yelling at each other again (well mostly my fianc\u00e9 and her mom vs her dad) and I'm starting to feel really guilty about this whole thing.", "created_utc": 1680213041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1270es2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time to fess up and tell your fiancee everything - make it clear you are not asking him to stand up for you after he knocked you over so many times.\n\nIf she can't accept that, then maybe this isn't the match you thought it was.

They need to be told your reasons and that your decision is final, assuming you still want to marry her.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t HAVE to have your sister as her bridesmaid. Sounds like she made that choice. You get to make this one. Honestly, I would tell her how it would feel for you to have to hear those remarks next to you through the whole ceremony. How much that would take you out of the experience. I hope she can understand that you want to be focused on your love and your love alone that day. Best of luck!", "NTA.

My brother was a jerk to my husband. Even though I was a bridesmaid in his wedding neither he nor my sister in law were attendants at ours. His wife did a reading. My little brother was an usher and my sister was a bridesmaid, as well as my 3 best friends. My husband\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t in the wedding party but his children were.

I hope people get off your case about it. \n\nCould you have dealt with this earlier? Yes. \n\nBut I also understand how difficult it can be to make a fuss in these situations. Especially when you sense the reaction from others will be 'Yeah, but....' and then excuses for the behavior.\n\nThis is your wedding too. Your future BIL has already shown when he feels a little awkward or just because he feels like it, he's gonna show up racist/disrespectful with you. That is not something you should have to look back and remember from your groomsman when you think of you're wedding day.\n\nAnd frankly, it's passed time to normalize the idea that it's okay to offend racists.", "NTA.

She now knows what happened, and you should be clear about that to everyone involved in this. You don't need to feel ashamed of being bullied, he should be ashamed of his behavior and his parents should be ashamed for having a kid who was a bully and a racist in high school.\n\nYou don't need to do this angrily. Obviously, it would've been nice to have said it earlier. Explain why you didn't, how you've wanted to keep the peace and not cause conflict, but that you do not want someone who gave you some of the worst days of your life stand next to you during what should be one of the happiest days of your life.", "NTA. Great job drawing a hard line in the sand. \n\nBullying is awful and I get why you were reluctant to dive into it when it could be avoided. I empathize. But why did you lie to your gf when you said his comments were fine? When she defended you, did you thank her or tell her it was not big deal?\n\nWhat I am getting at is that is not clear if you have ever sat your fianc\u00e9 down and gone into how much his bullying affected you. If you have, then I question why you are marrying this person who expects you to be \u201cover it.\u201d If you haven\u2019t, it might appear to her that you and her brother had a special bond where you shit on each other and are ok with it, or something, and that you suddenly flipped the script. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t tell her the whole truth, you need to loop her in on this. Like sexual assault, bullying is intrusive mentally, psychologically, and of course socially. You absolutely should not have that person stand up for you at your wedding, and I wonder how much you should have this person in your life at all.", "NTA  That being said, if her family still pushes for this and you're tempted to give in...well, do you have an aunt with a hunchback and who is incontinent?  Demand that she be made a bridesmaid (she's my favourite aunt, didn't I tell you?).  That way, she'll hate looking at your wedding photos as much as you will.", "ESH - You are not good at communicating. You've basically lied and been evasive about the whole issue and then sprung it on her after shes already in an awkward position. As far as the brothers concerned obviously he was an asshole back then and probably still now but since you've both grown up you've acted normal, not brought it up and as far as he's concerned it's probably bygones so not surprising that he and everyone else might be a bit surprised that this is now coming up. Also putting in the group chat just seems immature as well, just have a word with her brother like you should have done at the start and be clear with what you mean \"I don't like it when you call me this name and due to our past I'm not comfortable making you a groomsman\". \n\nAlso if your fiance still wants him to be involved maybe he can be your sisters witness or something so he's firmly on her side of the wedding party and nothing to do with yours.", "Uh. I'm not sure how you expect marriage to go when you couldn't even tell her her brother was a racist bigot. And then the time she defended you, you basically sided with her brother and said it wasn't a big deal? You get to pick your groomsman but that's literally the start of things not the end man. How do you forecast this all going?\n\nGood luck man NTA", "NTA. Your wedding man.", "NTA. clearly he hasn't grown up and his family is dismissing his disrespect and racism towards you. I wouldn't want him to be a groomsman either. Your fiance should stand by you on this.", "NTA that you are even tolerating him in your life let alone at your wedding is beyond kind of you.", "I have read a lot of comments made by OP, so for that I am saying ESH\n\nOP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 for not understanding the situation and throwing a fit.\n\nOP\u2019s future BIL for being racist and especially for telling you *he has nothing to apologise for*\n\nAnd you, OP, are A H to yourself. I am sorry but I\u2019ve read so many comments made by you and well. You\u2019re allowing to your future family in law treating you really badly. Future BIL didn\u2019t even invite you to his wedding even tho you were with your fianc\u00e9 for 3 years at that point. And now your fianc\u00e9 expects you to made him your groomsman? Your future BIL doesn\u2019t make any comments about your weight anymore; however, you also admitted you lost a lot of weight - so one do believe he\u2019d keep making degrading comments if you looked the same as you used to. Your future BIL made racial comments about you and your fianc\u00e9 disregarded that. Have you thought about the fact that your future kids will be mixed - Indian + Italian - so there\u2019s a massive change your future BIL might me racist towards them too. Or even if he\u2019s not racist towards future kids, how are you gonna explain your kids that your BIL, their uncle, is racists towards their father? \nYou said how bad your future BIL was to you but now he\u2019s back in your life and you\u2019re allowing him to treat you badly again. And your fianc\u00e9 is not exactly siding with you either. You seriously need to have a conversation with the whole family in law and discuss the racial comments. Maybe even bullying that\u2019s been going on for way too long at this point\u2026", "Y T A for pretending it's not important and finally speaking up when the wedding comes up. You made your bed and now you have to lie on it: either set a hard line that he can't be a groomsman and risk your fianc\u00e9's brother and family being mad at you for the rest of your life, or suck it up and let him be a groomsman. Neither choice is particularly appealing, good luck. ESH", "NTA. However, you are getting a window into how the marriage will be down the line. Dating, strong relationships and early marriage are all still the \"honeymoon\" phase. You just got a glimpse into how things will be 5-10 years after marriage or when the first kid comes or maybe even sooner. \n\nThe fact that you rightly decided to mitigate any further drama related to your childhood trauma and how she is dismissive is very telling. Before anyone says that bullying is normal, tell that to all the kids suffering from extreme anxiety, PTSD or committed suicide. It is time to normalize that bullying helps no one and is good for nothing. \n\nIf a frank discussion about boundaries, emotional support and trust isn't had before the wedding, then things will slowly get worse. One of the things that spouses have to decide is where/when to draw the line when it comes to interactions and conflict between spouse and parents/family. \n\nTake it from me when I say that trying to keep your relationship with you spouse and their family at the same level never works. Sides are always taken, and if the two of you are not on the same page for this small requirement of you not rewarding your bully, then just think how you will feel when something truly important comes along and you two can't agree and support each other.", "YTA - Normally I'm all screw the bully... but you've put yourself in this position through the course of multiple lies of omission over the past 15+ months, if I'm counting right. You should have talked to her the minute you figured it out. You should have stood up when he referred to you with that nickname.

Nit doing so will set your marriage up for problems, you don't want that.", "I agree it isn't, between his complete inability to communicate or be open and her dismissal of his feelings the marriage is doomed in my opinion but its not just her fault he has some responsibility here as well.\n\nJust imagine how long have they been together at this point. He's basically lied for half their relationship and now is saying that actually the thing that he's minimised and pretended to her didn't even happen and actually took her brothers side over hers at one point is actually a huge deal and that he doesn't want her brother who she presumably loves to be involved in her wedding day.  Imagine spending what I'm assuming is years believing one thing about their relationship, plus what she herself knows of her brother which probably isn't his identity as a racist bully, then all of a sudden OPs saying actually everything you've believed isn't real. Personally I'd probably think he was exaggerating or something to have no brought it up at all before the wedding. \n\nTotal mess and they all carry some blame.", "Or if it goes sideways to lean into all the nasty things he did with sister"]}
