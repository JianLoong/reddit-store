I graduated high school the year before she started at the same high school. I did, however, go to school with her older brother \\[30M\\]. Her brother was a bully to my during our entire school careers. He made fun of me for being fat and nerdy, he would call me racist names (They're Italian and I'm Indian, so he had a lot to say about that), and he was just overall terrible to me.\n\nI figured once we graduated, I'd never see him again, and for the most part, I was right. I went off to college out of state, and then ended up going to graduate school as well. During my first year in grad school, I was a TA for a class, and I noticed one of the girls who I thought was very smart and very pretty, but obviously I couldn't go out with her because of our positions. Well, right after the semester ended, I ran into her at a coffee shop off campus and we chatted for a bit. She ended up asking me for my number, and then she actually asked me out a few weeks later. We've been together ever since.\n\nAt the start of our relationship, I had no idea who her brother was. They have a very common American last name, so it's not like that was going to do anything. Eventually, we figured out we were from the same town and we went to the same high school, at which point she asked me if I knew her brother and I said I knew of him, but not well. I probably should've told her what her brother had done to me at that point, but I was too embarrassed, so I kept it hidden.\n\nThings really came to a head when she introduced me to her family a year later. Her brother actually called me by the same nickname he liked to use to bully me, and then made a few semi-insulting remarks towards me again. My fianc\u00e9 (girlfriend at the time) noticed and called him out on it, and he just explained that that was how we always talked before. I told her it wasn't a big deal since I didn't want to cause any drama.\n\nWe got engaged three months ago. Recently, we were talking about wedding plans and stuff with her family, and he asked me when I was going to ask him to be a groomsman and if I was doing anything special. I deflected, and after the call I asked her about it. She explained that her brother expected to be made a groomsman, since she was making my little sister and her SIL bridesmaids and he made her a bridesmaid in his wedding. I told her about why I didn't like her brother, and she said that she understood, but it was still right to make him a groomsman. I said no again, and she got pretty upset about it and said her parents were going to be mad. I was also annoyed, so I texted her family group chat to say that he wasn't going to be one under any circumstance, and now they're all made at me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I texted my BIL and told him that I felt like I deserved an apology from him. He said he had \"nothing to be sorry for\". I told him that I didn't even want him at the wedding and the only reason he was going to be there was because he had to be. Everyone is even more angry with me now. I know I shouldn't have said that, but he really upset me with that. I feel like I have to fix this.", "created_utc": 1680213041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1270es2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially when you sense the reaction from others will be 'Yeah, but....' and then excuses for the behavior.\n\nThis is your wedding too. Your future BIL has already shown when he feels a little awkward or just because he feels like it, he's gonna show up racist/disrespectful with you.

Obviously, it would've been nice to have said it earlier. Explain why you didn't, how you've wanted to keep the peace and not cause conflict, but that you do not want someone who gave you some of the worst days of your life stand next to you during what should be one of the happiest days of your life.", "NTA. Great job drawing a hard line in the sand. \n\nBullying is awful and I get why you were reluctant to dive into it when it could be avoided. I empathize. But why did you lie to your gf when you said his comments were fine? When she defended you, did you thank her or tell her it was not big deal?\n\nWhat I am getting at is that is not clear if you have ever sat your fianc\u00e9 down and gone into how much his bullying affected you. If you have, then I question why you are marrying this person who expects you to be \u201cover it.\u201d If you haven\u2019t, it might appear to her that you and her brother had a special bond where you shit on each other and are ok with it, or something, and that you suddenly flipped the script. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t tell her the whole truth, you need to loop her in on this. Like sexual assault, bullying is intrusive mentally, psychologically, and of course socially. You absolutely should not have that person stand up for you at your wedding, and I wonder how much you should have this person in your life at all.", "NTA  That being said, if her family still pushes for this and you're tempted to give in...well, do you have an aunt with a hunchback and who is incontinent?  Demand that she be made a bridesmaid (she's my favourite aunt, didn't I tell you?).  That way, she'll hate looking at your wedding photos as much as you will.", "ESH - You are not good at communicating. You've basically lied and been evasive about the whole issue and then sprung it on her after shes already in an awkward position. As far as the brothers concerned obviously he was an asshole back then and probably still now but since you've both grown up you've acted normal, not brought it up and as far as he's concerned it's probably bygones so not surprising that he and everyone else might be a bit surprised that this is now coming up. Also putting in the group chat just seems immature as well, just have a word with her brother like you should have done at the start and be clear with what you mean \"I don't like it when you call me this name and due to our past I'm not comfortable making you a groomsman\". \n\nAlso if your fiance still wants him to be involved maybe he can be your sisters witness or something so he's firmly on her side of the wedding party and nothing to do with yours.", "Uh. I'm not sure how you expect marriage to go when you couldn't even tell her her brother was a racist bigot. And then the time she defended you, you basically sided with her brother and said it wasn't a big deal? You get to pick your groomsman but that's literally the start of things not the end man. How do you forecast this all going?\n\nGood luck man NTA", "NTA. Your wedding man.", "NTA. clearly he hasn't grown up and his family is dismissing his disrespect and racism towards you.

Your future BIL doesn\u2019t make any comments about your weight anymore; however, you also admitted you lost a lot of weight - so one do believe he\u2019d keep making degrading comments if you looked the same as you used to. Your future BIL made racial comments about you and your fianc\u00e9 disregarded that. Have you thought about the fact that your future kids will be mixed - Indian + Italian - so there\u2019s a massive change your future BIL might me racist towards them too. Or even if he\u2019s not racist towards future kids, how are you gonna explain your kids that your BIL, their uncle, is racists towards their father? \nYou said how bad your future BIL was to you but now he\u2019s back in your life and you\u2019re allowing him to treat you badly again. And your fianc\u00e9 is not exactly siding with you either. You seriously need to have a conversation with the whole family in law and discuss the racial comments. Maybe even bullying that\u2019s been going on for way too long at this point\u2026", "Y T A for pretending it's not important and finally speaking up when the wedding comes up. You made your bed and now you have to lie on it: either set a hard line that he can't be a groomsman and risk your fianc\u00e9's brother and family being mad at you for the rest of your life, or suck it up and let him be a groomsman. Neither choice is particularly appealing, good luck. ESH", "NTA. However, you are getting a window into how the marriage will be down the line. Dating, strong relationships and early marriage are all still the \"honeymoon\" phase. You just got a glimpse into how things will be 5-10 years after marriage or when the first kid comes or maybe even sooner. \n\nThe fact that you rightly decided to mitigate any further drama related to your childhood trauma and how she is dismissive is very telling. Before anyone says that bullying is normal, tell that to all the kids suffering from extreme anxiety, PTSD or committed suicide. It is time to normalize that bullying helps no one and is good for nothing. \n\nIf a frank discussion about boundaries, emotional support and trust isn't had before the wedding, then things will slowly get worse. One of the things that spouses have to decide is where/when to draw the line when it comes to interactions and conflict between spouse and parents/family. \n\nTake it from me when I say that trying to keep your relationship with you spouse and their family at the same level never works. Sides are always taken, and if the two of you are not on the same page for this small requirement of you not rewarding your bully, then just think how you will feel when something truly important comes along and you two can't agree and support each other.", "YTA - Normally I'm all screw the bully... but you've put yourself in this position through the course of multiple lies of omission over the past 15+ months, if I'm counting right.

No kid deserves that.", "> he doesn't go out of his way to torment me.\n\nAre you **sure** about that?  Unless he is completely lacking in self-awareness, he should realize that he was a bully to you and should not insist on being one of your groomsman.  Has he ever even apologized for his teenage behavior?\n\nIt sounds to me like this dick is still being a dick.", "Not to bad... Just because it used to be worse, in your mind. But that's is still extremely disrespectful behavior. He is still the same horrible guy.", "Wait - was the bullying racial in nature?  Because that makes it worse.  You definitely don't need him standing with you at the altar.", "Then you have a choice because they aren\u2019t compromising with you. \n1. Let him participate \n2. Don\u2019t and pay for your own wedding. \n\nNTA. \nYou don\u2019t need someone who emotionally abused you celebrating your happy day in your wedding party. But this will cause problems.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit:  I think you should stand your ground and NOT have him in the party after reading some of OP comments about bil", "Why are you so okay with everybody, including your fiance, making you do this? This WILL be the rest of your marriage and you're just letting it slide. This is sad", "Op, \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this, but this is not going away. \n\nPlease have the talk now. You need to talk about kids, racism, guardianship. Your future BIL is a bully and those \u201cbackhanded\u201d comments will still be said in front of your children. What will be the boundaries when it comes to family? What if the kids look like you? \n\nYou need to tell your fianc\u00e9e how serious the bullying was and that you didn\u2019t want to go to school because of him. He actually caused a lot of damage. \n\nYou need to have a fianc\u00e9e meeting and then a parental meeting. Things have to come to light and be crystal clear where you stand and how BIL needs to stop all comments before you enter the marriage, especially since BIL said he wouldn\u2019t even apologize. (What an AH!)\n\nYour future wife should know what kind of AH brother she has and how he still harms you and could potentially harm your future kids psychologically. This is a life long commitment Op. You would be TA to yourself BIG time (and your family/plus future children) by not addressing this seriously before the wedding. Drama will be ever present, but better now than down the road and at the wedding. AH BIL could be throwing shade up and down during the wedding and on the wedding day because of his racism. I would be concerned. \n\nGood luck Op!", "Yeah, but she still stubbornly thinks you should make him a groomsman. How do you square that betrayal in your own mind?", "And she still doesn't have your back, and she likely never will.", "OoooooooOoo. F that guy. Hold your ground.", "He is still bullying you. I would ensure you have security at the wedding ready to whisk him away at the first sign of being an asshole.", "Less sure about it?? She literally doesn't have your side now. She is picking her racist brother over you. She would rather you be traumatized on your wedding day than support you.", "Make no mistake. I am not saying don't marry her, major red flag, etc. I just wish I had more of the types of discussions I am recommending when I was younger. While I wasn't bullied to your extent, I, too, have a very conflict adverse approach to most situations. If I don't see the value or point in arguing. I mostly let things go. It is just not worth arguing with stupid in most instances. \n\nHowever, this does train us to suppress own wants/needs/desires when it comes to those we care about. This is not a sustainable outlook and will come to a head down the road. It is better to get the uncomfortable conversations out of the way now versus waiting for later and getting the, \"Why didn't you say something sooner? It was obviously not a problem before.\"", "Wow. So 5 years of never standing up for yourself, or even indicating how bad it was, and instead dropping the bombshell now? That is so disrespectful to your future wife to not trust her with that.", "I think the consequences of your actions will be with you for the rest of your life.  If you are going to do traditional Indian things for the wedding, maybe lean into that.  If he's really as racist as it sounds he will either bow out or be freaking miserable.", "How do you think he\u2019ll treat your future kids? You\u2019re marrying into a racist family without support from your fianc\u00e9e. Think long and hard about the kind of future you\u2019re signing up for. You need to be on the same page with and discuss ALL future possibilities. For eg who would she want to designate as a legal guardian for your kids if you both passed away? Would you be comfortable with her choice? \n\nIf she\u2019s brushing off his behaviour and his unwillingness to apologise it means she *doesn\u2019t see a problem with his actions and words* which is very very concerning.", "There\u2019s your answer.  I would respond and say \u2018thank you for making my decision to NOT include you in my wedding easier and final\u2019", "I've already told her exactly what her brother did to me. I gave a complete recount of my middle and high school years and told her every single thing he did, as well as the things I suspected he did but had no idea whether it was him or one of his friends.", "Yeah, but the groomsmen would be most involved in the church ceremony, which is solely for my fiancee and her family, so I feel like it makes sense that she might get some input there.", "Don't think I'd want to show her this post with how badly everyone here is talking about her.", "She called him out for saying things when we first met, so I wouldn't say she's okay with it.", "Yea partially", "I mean I'd prefer if he wasn't there at all, honestly, but there's not really any way for me to get that. There's no way I can let him participate.\n\nHe was actually my number one bully the whole time. The only thing that kept me alive was thinking that I'd never have to see him again.", "If they've been together for a long time and this has never been mentioned and then its sprung on her she likely thinks it can't have  even that big of a deal since he's literally never mentioned this to me before and even gone out of his way to agree with the brother that the nickname was no big deal when she stuck her neck out and stuck up for him. I can see how this has likely come as a total shock to her.", "I was just trying to avoid causing drama or make her want to break up with me.", "I don't think the her parents or the rest of her family is racist, just maybe her brother a bit. We haven't talked about guardianship for our future kids. I didn't realize that was a conversation people even had really.", "Yes. I saw you\u2019d done that in a later comment. Sorry I didn\u2019t see that before writing. At any rate I firmly believe you\u2019re NTA for excluding him. There\u2019s no requirement for in-laws to be in wedding parties. None of my future SILs were my bridesmaids when I got married for example.", "Personally that's exactly why she should see it. The fact she is on her racists brothers side and is disgusting.", "You really need to sit down with her and tell her exactly what you said in this post. She is not hearing you at best or ignoring your feelings at worst. This is going to dictate your future with her. Ask her if she would be willing to include your sister if she\u2019d been her bully.", "She wants you to make her brother a groomsman. The very guy that she knows bullied and traumatized you. The one person that can, and probably will ruin the wedding and cause more trauma. She is taking his side. I'm not saying go straight to calling off the wedding, but you need to have a serious conversation with her about how she is making you feel and hopefully get her to see why she is 1000% in the wrong on this.", "Backhanded comments are still continued bullying and racism. And she's let those fly.", "I\u2019m sorry OP. What a cruel twist of fate to fall in love with his sister. Again. If they hold it against you, you should pay for your own wedding.", "tell your fianc\u00e9e THIS right here. i don't think she realizes the severity of the situation, it sounds like you've been minimizing it and downplaying it to keep the peace. stop doing that and be honest with her. tell her how bad it was. i understand it will be hard for her to hear because it's her brother, but IF YOU TRUST HER, then you have to let her in and be honest about the fact that her brother traumatized you.", "I feel for you! You always knew she would decide to stand by her brother and dismiss his actions. You were afraid them and you are afraid know. No one is going to stand up for you. And sadly this is your choosing", "Her brother is racist to you her *future husband* and is a disgusting bully and she has no problem with brushing it under the rug and thinks he should stand next to you at your wedding? Her parents are mad at *you* and the family group chat is mad at *you*\u2026. Who\u2019s mad at the racist bully? \n\nReally think about how problematic that is. They are condoning his behaviour towards you by staying silent, supporting him, thinking you should forgive him even though he\u2019s not even sorry. You don\u2019t need to overtly say racist things to be a racist. Their support of him tells you everything you need to know about their family. \n\nAnd while I don\u2019t agree with holding parents/family responsible for all kids that have problematic views or behaviours, the fact they\u2019re not mortified and furious *at him* sounds like maybe he wasn\u2019t raised very well. \n\nSo these are the grandparents and family of your future kids. Are they going to do childcare? Does the brother have kids that will be your kid\u2019s cousins? How do you think the brother and extended family will treat your kids? If your kids are mistreated who in the family will have their back if they don\u2019t have yours? What if you separate eventually and she\u2019s got primary custody? Moves back to her parent\u2019s house? Think of every eventuality before you commit to a life with this family.\n\nTake it from me, someone who had a kid without giving a second thought to their extended family, you are marrying this family not just your fianc\u00e9e. That\u2019s not usually an issue if you guys are on the same page, but your fianc\u00e9e is throwing up some massive red flags.", "I've told her exactly what he did to me when we were younger. I gave her a full account of it.", "So much this! Total red flags.", "ufff this is a great point. even if they are \u201cnice people\u201d it is going to become ops job to educate all these people on how to deal with poc. why sone things are offensive etc etc. I wouldn\u2019t be up to the task", "And she still supports your abuser over you.", "did you tell her how it made you FEEL though? if you opened up to her about the effect it had on you emotionally and psychologically, and she still doesnt understand, then you'll have a crossroads ahead of you. \n\nalso, if the leverage here is the money her parents are spending, consider asking her to elope or get a courthouse marriage. i understand that she is also under pressure from her family, and may feel obligated to bow to their wishes. if yall just decide you dont need a big wedding, then they dont have that leverage anymore."]}
