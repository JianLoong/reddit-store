In all honesty I had to invite myself to this Thanksgiving so I could spend time with Mom, I never would have been invited. \n\nLast night one of my siblings begged me not to go for my own sake. When I pressed, they told me they were at a family gathering recently (I was absent as it was 20 hours away) and everyone there was talking trash about me and calling me a \"crazy bitch.\" Those who weren't talking trash said nothing in my defense, including Mom. That stings because I do have bipolar disorder and  PTSD and I'm pretty sensitive about being perceived as crazy. These are all people who claim to be woke and would never call a friend or colleague crazy but with me it's open season. \n\nSo now I'm considering cancelling that trip and instead going on a road trip to an art exhibit I've been wanting to see all year and getting some quality time with my husband. Would that make me a total asshole? Especially since I *cringe* invited myself in the first place?\n\n**ETA I haven't visited my family, nor them me in 8 years\n\n***ETA I just told them--Mom didn't care one way or the other. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1668611475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywvzh2/wibta_if_i_change_my_thanksgiving_plans_after/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why go where you aren\u2019t wanted? It doesn\u2019t sound like you would enjoy hanging out with these people. You can always schedule your visit for another time. Your mom will have plenty of company on Thanksgiving, you can probably provide more comfort and less drama one on one anyway instead of being part of a busy visit.", "NTA\n\nYou invited yourself, you can rescind your own invitation. In fact, giving advance notice that you won't be attending would be a polite thing to do. There's nothing wrong with wanting to spend quality time with your husband, and regardless of what the others think of your decision not to attend Thanksgiving you would be doing it for both a personal reason (Their immaturity) and for a legitimate reason (Spending time with the husband.)\n\nYou don't *technically* have to mention the personal reason you wouldn't be going since that would stir up drama; they showed their true colors already.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to put yourself through that. Can your mom travel? Maybe buy her a plane ticket to come see you at a later date.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t expose yourself to these toxic relatives", "NTA. Gossip is rude!", "NTA. You have every right to change the plans. Especially because neither of your siblings seem to have any inkling what bipolar means for someone...they have an opinion on your alleged actions and never asked you why you do the things you do. My husband is bipolar and I know what it's like. \n\nMaybe it is a better idea (if you really want to see your mom), to go on another day but Thanksgiving?

Please go to the art exhibit.", "NAH for the current question about attending.  Just send your regrets and go to the art show; there's no call for you to get into your reasons and the gossip you heard (which may not even be completely true).\n\nIf you were initially not invited and the family feels free to talk about you in that way, then I'm wondering what you're leaving out here in regard to why you're estranged from your whole family. Is it possible that your past **actions** (not your general diagnosis) toward them led them reasonably to cut ties with you?", "NTA - take your trip and have fun, fun, fun! Your blood relatives (not really acting like you're family, imo) are cruel jerks. For your own piece of mind stay away. If your mom wants to see you or if you want to see her, work that out amongst yourselves, away from the others. Spend time with your husband seeing something you actually will get enjoyment out of.", "NTA \nYour sibling is looking out for your best interest.  Do not go.  In fact, it\u2019s probably best to write these people off.  They aren\u2019t acting in a loving way towards you.  \n\nEnjoy the art exhibit and your husband.

This is probably going to be very hard to hear, but it really doesn't sound like any of them \u2013 mom included \u2013 actually love you.

No you are nta, but they obviously dislike you. I still don't get how you invite yourself then ask if yta if you don't go?

You love your mom and she doesn't seem to reciprocate.  \n\nFrom your description, it sounds like you should go NC with everyone.  Go see the art exhibit, enjoy your husband and live your life!\n\nSometimes, people you are biologically related to are not good people.  Hard to come to grips sometime, but there it is.  My mom has a large family and over decades I have identified about 4 people I want to stay in touch with... otherwise, nah, not at all.  I occasionally feel a bit sad about it, but hey life is much sweeter without unkind people in it.", "NTA.  Don't go. Hope you enjoy the exhibit!", "NTA.  So sorry that you Mom didn't care one way of the other.  There is your answer.  Blood doesn't make family.", "How reliable a narrator is the sibling?

They didn\u2019t want you there, and now you won\u2019t be, and we\u2019re polite enough to give advanced notice for food/table count purposes.  Not sure how this is even still up\u2026", "ESH tbh. Yes it's mean to talk about someone behind their back, and it's particularly cruel to do it about their complex. But I'm confused on why you're surprised that people that didn't invite you for a family gathering dislike you. I'm not even sure why you invited yourself since it's not up to you to decide whether you can go when you've not even been invited. You should've just gone to your mum's without it being Thanksgiving if you wanted to support her in her grief", "NTA, just be prepared for them to continue to talk shit about you.

I know they've been mad that I don't send more money to help out. I want to send it to Mom directly--not through my siblings and no one wants it done that way. I imagine that was the impetus for the trash talking.", "It's definitely true. They call me a crazy bitch to my face. \n\nMultiple therapists have told me I'm the black sheep of the family. It's not my entire family, just over half of them. My family has experienced a lot of trauma, addiction, abuse, mental illness, and poverty and I'm the only one who has sought therapy and treatment, moved from the region, and managed to escape. That creates resentment. To them I'm crazy because I do things they would never do--like seek help.", "My sibling is very reliable. My mom is a liar. She will say anything to keep people around her happy", "In the nicest way possible, you need to take the hint. For whatever reason....they don't want to be around you.

Why would you even send it to Mom - she doesn't give a shit about you for any other reason?", "Don\u2019t send any money. Not even to your mom. She just sit there and let them trash talk you.", "That's evading the question. It was about your past actions.

You deserve better.", "OP can also be an unreliable narrator in this sense. A family friend of mine is manic and bi-polar and of course refuses medication and she is a very nice person but she has also said and done things that have caused 4 of 4 of her kids to go LC or NC. The things that happened she either doesn't remember or remembers vastly differently. Not all people diagnosed with the same or similar diagnoses are unreliable narrators but my friend sure is. \n\nOP you should probably cut your losses with regards to your family and move on. This doesn't seem like something that can be resolved normally, let alone when there's money problems (which they shouldn't make your problem) and grief involved.", "As a person (24f) diagnosed with bipolar type one and a few other things, thank you for making it clear not all of us are unreliable narrators. Because I'm aware of my illnesses, I strive to be as transparent as possible and tell both sides of the story. There have been scenarios where I've completely raged and done/said things I don't remember, but they are few and far in-between. According to my sisters (who have unfortunately been witnesses to my episodes) I usually don't end up at that point for no apparent reason. It always stemmed from my parents pushing me to the point of snapping mentally. In fact, the only times I've been pushed that far is because of my abusive (verbal and physical)\nparents and equally abusive ex boyfriend."]}
