My grandmother has the habit of giving basically anyone thats family a key to our home and honestly I didn't mind it until my uncle came to the U.S. My uncle has a key to our house, he's around 47-50(M), heavily into the traditional Dominican household where the woman does everything and he just works and drinks all day. And he just comes and goes leaving dirty dishes and a dirty kitchen for all the women of the house to clean it atleast 3-4 times a week.\n\nThe other day he decided to come home while I was making a sandwich, and because he doesn't understand to not scare a jumpy person when they have a knife in hand he came at me and scared me. (I have anxiety and take medication for it and everyone that has entered the house knows it) I swear I only stopped myself because I saw his face. He then laughs it off and dumps his dishes in the sink so he can sit on the couch. Keep in mind he's always treated every woman in this house like a maid that will do his bidding just because hes the only \"man of the house\". (He doesn't even live here he just has a key)\n\nAs I put my sandwich in the toaster he yells from the couch, HEY (my name) MAKE ME A SANDWICH WHILE YOUR THERE!! I asked him who he thought he was and said no and to make it himself. I told my mother about what he did once she got home and she told me that I was being ungreatful and that I should respect my elders no matter what, she then went on to say that if she were there she would have smacked me upside the head for being so rude, she also said its not his fault that he speaks to me in that way because he's always been like that.\nEven though everyone that has entered that door exept him has always talked to me politely and never asked me to do something in such a harsh manner.\n\nAfter getting that scolding from my mother I feel like I did overreact and I feel like I should've just made him the stupid sandwich. I dont know if im in the wrong but im sure I am (please dont judge me for my age or call me spoiled) But what do you guys think AITA?", "created_utc": 1685243835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tq11b/aita_for_not_making_my_uncle_a_sandwich/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
