Plus he said he didn\u2019t like the activities you do\u2026 but then he complains when he\u2019s not invited? He needs to sort himself out", "NTA.\n\nThey may have viewed you as the AH because of the way you presented your efforts. It could be better to focus on the fact that you made the efforts to include him in the activities but that they weren\u2019t appreciated.", "NTA. If it was just a case of you not having the same interests, I would say the kind thing would still be to include him, by at least extending the invitation so he was free to join or not the activities you are participating in. \n\nBut it goes beyond different personalities and interests - Thomas has expressed he does not feel safe on said activities, going behind your back to a superior to do so. When you take this note and stop invitations so he does not feel pressured to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable, he again goes behind your back to complain. He sounds very immature for not just having a civil conversation with you about how he feels. His feelings aren\u2019t wrong, but his way of handling them is.\n\nI would be inclined to turn it back on the advisor and Grace. Have they been inviting Thomas to their social activities? If not, why are you the only one being expected to take responsibility for another student\u2019s experience who you have no supervisory capacity over or responsibility for mentoring? And does Thomas make efforts to socialise with you by making suggestions for you two to hang out?\n\nI would further point out that you have only been taking advantage of opportunities with the host org that were equally open to Thomas - it is not your fault that you are taking responsibility of making the most of your opportunities there while Thomas isn\u2019t.", "NTA. He literally said he doesn\u2019t want to be included. You need to point out that you did put in effort, but they weren\u2019t appreciated by him. Ask them what they think you should do, when he considers the activities you like \u201cdangerous\u201d", "NTA.  Thomas is not your younger sibling, your mentee, your pupil, your protege, or your disciple, who you might have some responsibility to help along.  Thomas is an adult who needs to take responsibility for his own social life.\n\n How can you include someone in activities when they so completely fail at communicating with you that they can\u2019t even tell you that they\u2019re uncomfortable or scared?  It doesn\u2019t sound like there is a way you can please Thomas - he finds the things you like unappealing or frightening, but he\u2019s also grouchy about you not bringing him along.\n\nIt would be kind and generous for you to invite him to non-physical activities you do, but frankly I think his whining to mummy no matter what you do has not earned him that consideration.  In your shoes, I think I would do it anyway, though, for one simple reason - academia is a small world, as is research generally, and having an advisor who is anything less than fully enthusiastic about you and your ability to be a team player can be devastating.", "NTA. He's 20 let him FITFO", "NTA, because you have tried to include him in your activities and it just doesn\u2019t suit him. \n\nHowever maybe you could try to connect through his interests? He\u2019s obviously finding things lonely and because he\u2019s struggling to connect with people it\u2019s only gonna get worse. If you find some way to connect with him or introduce him to others in the host organization then he likely won\u2019t complain to those above you. \n\nThat said it\u2019s not your responsibility and you\u2019re not preventing him from meeting people, you just have an easier time connecting because you share common interests.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to entertain. \nYou included him before and he complained so you stopped including him. Sounds reasonable.", "Nta Thomas don't like activities you do and he complains to advisor now he not happy you don't want to do anything with him. Why don't Thomas find a new friends who have same interest as him to hangout with. He already adult he should look after himself not just waiting for someone to make friends for him. You need to talking to your advisor about how you invite him out with you but he don't like it so you stop do it.", "NTA Definitely explain to your advisor that you have tried to include Thomas; after he complained about it, you stopped including him since he said nothing to you about it, but rather went to the advisor instead. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to change your free time activities, so it would be stressful to continue to try to include him in things that he doesn\u2019t like. Perhaps Thomas should be moved to Grace\u2019s city, so that he would be happier.", "NTA.  You're not his cruise director.  Obviously he was ill equipped to make a big trip like this and the age difference is showing.  Ask the advisor where its written in your contract you have to entertain this kid continuously.", "It's not your job to babysit another adult. Grace needs to stay out of this period. Your advisor needs to deal with Thomas. NTA. He probably shouldn't be there if he feels unsafe.", "NTA. Remind everyone that Thomas is an adult. You never volunteered to be his babysitter nor did anyobe disclose that being his sitter was a cobdition of your degree profram. Point out that if he needs someone to hold his hand, then he shouldnt be living/studying/working overseas.", "NTA by American standards.  However, American standards aren't universal --  various African and Asian cultures are well known for emphasizing the interests of the group over the individual.\n\nDo you have to try harder with Thomas?  No one can make you.  But it's a good skill to grow and have in your arsenal for the rest of your life.\n\nBtw, you don't have to make Thomas social or athletic.  That would be great, but even for Grace and advisor, that's more a hope than an expectation.  You just have to be willing to include him even though he complains about everything.  Think of it like family -- people have to be truly horrible to be kicked out.  If they're just whiny and unpleasant, they're still included in family get-togethers.\n\nAll you need to do is invite Thomas, and smile and nod and think about something else when he whines.  Pretty sure that's what a lot of people do around him -- and frankly another one of those little life hacks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You do not need to try again.  Thomas is an adult and he needs to act like one, as does Grace.", "NTA\n\nI am close to saying NAH because it sounds like Thomas definitely has a different understanding of the dynamics and Grace and the Advisor might be agreeing with his interpretation. So you might be wrong about the expectations of your time there. \n\nYou don't view yourself as his mentor, but maybe your advisor does? It sounds like Thomas thought he had to go do things with you when you invited him. It might be a good idea to set up a meeting (in person or zoom) with your advisor in a way that no one else will be there and state that you think there has been a misunderstanding and you want to clarify. You viewed the situation as 2 students who happen to be in the same place, with no expectation of you overseeing or being responsible for Thomas beyond you being 2 humans living together. But was there the expectation that you would be supervising or mentoring Thomas, because you were not informed of that. \n\nI have been a grad student that did not realize I had inherited 2 undergrads until people were talking to me about them having too much down time. It is not fair, but it is worth a check to make sure you were not told and to clear the air so that hopefully the advisor can still provide a good reference as needed. Approach the conversation calmly and focus on making sure you understand the expectations, and you can state after your advisor has spoken: that you are sorry for the miscommunication but you took this project on as a student and did not expect or agree to supervisor or mentor anyone else. You are here if Thomas has an emergency, but you cannot run Thomas's schedule especially for social activities.", "You've covered my top two reactions quite well - the guy obviously talks more to them so why aren't they looking after him socially? Why should you keep inviting him to your activities when you leave him feeling unsafe? OP, NTA, and I hope you otherwise enjoy this experience!", "If they are both so nice and believe in inclusiveness so much, they should have no problem being Thomas\u2019s friend/caretaker/security blanket. But if they are only interested in virtue signaling, it is way easier just to make Thomas OP\u2019s problem.", "Try to think of it as a leadership exercise. Socially, do you owe him any further courtesy? Probably not. You reached out with your interests and he complained. Professionally, it\u2019s a good look if you help a colleague adapt and integrate. This is an essential skill in academia these days but if you move to industry like you say, leadership is financially rewarded. \n\nEven in an English speaking country, the culture shock can be quite severe so you may be doing him a solid if you help break the isolation", "NTA\n\nYou are both adults. You are not responsible for him. Moreover he complained when you DID include him. You are damned either way.

You have included him, but you are not his mother or caretaker.  It sounds like he does not have the emotional maturity to be a participant in this academic program.\n\nOn second though: you might want to schedule a one on one with your advisor to sort this out and explain your side (because who knows what they\u2019re saying).  Currently you are the odd one out in this program, although it appears you are thriving.  The last thing you want is for your advisor to have a bad opinion of you (could affect being invited back, references, opportunities passed on, etc).

You have made efforts to include Thomas in social activities outside of the academic assignment. The result has been his complaining and demanding that you both provide recreational services for him and change your plans to align with his preferences- through third parties.\n\nYour advisor needs to deal with Thomas. Advisor needs to clarify what the requirements and expectations are as participants in the program. \n\nYou are justified to stop making efforts to include him in your free time activities. He can and should make his own plans. Your reward for trying has been his creating and spreading drama throughout your small group. Your privacy, autonomy and comfort are being attacked on two fronts. If Thomas needs babysitting and remedial lessons on adult professional direct communication, that's your advisor's problem, not yoirs.", "Totally agree with you! You said what I would have\u2026", "Your first line is true but all the people in this story are Americans, so it's a bit moot. I sincerely hope the host organization is homegrown and not Americans abroad, but OP has clearly demonstrated they're able to connect with different types of people and cultures...when they have similar interests. Which is how everyone makes friends.\n\nI do think people who live fast should consider slowing down to meet new people who don't move as fast as them, but there is no reference to Thomas trying to move faster (assuming he can) in your response and it's hard to figure out why it's OP's job to include Thomas and not Thomas' job to connect with OP? Why isn't it Grace's job to coddle him?\n\nI know the dynamics are different when it's expats abroad (small community, sometimes need to adjust how you normally do things), but it's bizarre how OP needs to be the leader here. They're only three years older, too, same age as Grace, so it's not like they're some seasoned academic and expert in the country they're in. Thomas just feels left out because they aren't doing what he wants (even though he hasn't vocalized that - OP did invite him to things, he just didn't like them) and he's brooding rather than trying to fix his own situation. Personally, I've met this type before and him complaining to the advisor and Grace to make OP out to be the problem makes me completely unsympathetic.", "Are you sure?  Thomas is American, but I don't believe Grace and the advisor are.", "NTA for not including him, but you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot by not conceding to your advisor\u2019s directives. A solid recommendation from an advisor can go a long way once you\u2019re looking for jobs. Being labelled \u2018not a team player\u2019 will only hurt your future chances. In every job you will come into contact with people you share not interest with or actively dislike, but you don\u2019t get to freeze them out. You have to learn to phone it in and be sociable and polite, for your own benefit if not for theirs.", "They want you to babysit Thomas. They don't want you to include him in your activities, they want you to do what he wants so he can feel safe in his little bubble. Move along and ignore this kid so you can enjoy your trip to the fullest.

Why dont you do these things? That way you have a real reason to feel charitable instead of volunteering someone else and patting yourself on the back?\"", "NTA next time they bother you about it ask them where in the code of conduct or list of your duties does it state that your are responsible for planning activities and making friends for a 20yr old man? Remind them that neither of them took it upon themselves to find things for you to do or help you make friends, but you still managed to do just that so why is he not expected to do the same for himself? If you feel comfortable doing so I would also point out that *IF* it was anyone\u2019s responsibility other than Thomas\u2019s to help make sure that he is assimilating well and has a good role model it would be his advisor\u2019s/supervisor\u2019s responsibility, and since that is clearly not your job title you are confused as to why you are expected to assume that responsibility without having ever discussed/agreed to doing so? It is definitely unfair to expect you to cater your free time to him when neither of them do, and he just doesn\u2019t seem receptive to anything.

So tell your advisor that you are not excluding Thomas, merely trying to make the most of this incredible opportunity by immersing yourself in the culture, forming interpersonal  connections, and enjoying the geography of this country. Thomas\u2019s preferences are apparently incompatible with your own. \n\nAs Thomas\u2019s advisor he should actually be the one making sure he\u2019s engaging and fulfilling the purpose of this trip. Grace can go kick rocks. If they both continue, I\u2019d escalate your concerns about these expectations for babysitting to your advisor\u2019s superior.", "Well, HE can plan activities he likes and ask whether you are interested (and you can say no if you have no interest). Has he even tried?\n\nNTA at all.", "No, it is not your job to include people. The way you describe them they massively lack talent in making friends while you are an uncomplicated person to be around. \n\nIf you want to be helpfull,  maybe offer to organize some BBQ or something together with your coallegues. Tell them to invite the people they got to know over work  and invite the friends you made through your sports activities. Or invite your coallegues over to join you after sports to meet your friends there while  chatting and eating together. Maybe this will help to break the ice a bit. But it is entirely up to you!", "Bot stealing from https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s4lur/comment/jqvg0i4/?context=3", "Bot stole OP's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s4lur/comment/jqvgdbq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "I have lived abroad as an American in a developing country. There are often other Americans, Canadians, and varied English-speaking Europeans in such areas. If student isn't athletic or an adventurous eater - he can freaking use his study skills (he's a college student, surely he has some) to hunt down some ex-pat type group(s) and see who else is around! Go to the beach, visit markets, learn local cooking techniques, - there has to be something beyond whining behind people's backs and throwing them under busses that interests him!", "Yes, and so can Thomas. NTA", "op=NTA\n\nHe literally said you made him feel unsafe--to them NOT you. I would do NOTHING with someone making accusations like that.  \n\nPlus you are not his Emotional support animal--it is NOT your responsibility to care for him.  HE is an ADULT, he needs to act like one.", "What is this? A day camp? Of course NTA!", "NTA, that would be Grace and your academic advisor for putting Thomas's immature behavior on you instead of nipping it in the bud.  As for your activities, I see nothing wrong with them as I'm an avid hiker, who had done rock climbing when I was much younger and repelling down said rock areas.  \n\nAs for excluding him, I don't get that you invited him and he complained to the academic advisor, you stopped inviting him he complained to the academic advisor.  As someone who is active with a nonactive husband, his life style choices aren't yours.  Next time they talk with you ask them why you have to be his emotional support person and find activities he would like when they could make suggestions along with bonding with the host org.\n\nIn conclusion, I would state the next time they bring it up, it's not your job to nanny Thomas also tell them they put you in a catch-22 where you have invited and he's complained, you stopped inviting and he complained. Have them get someone who can play nurse maid for him", "NTA. Some people are fucking worthless abroad and it shouldn't be your job to be his emotional life vest when you are fulfilling your own study and adventure goals.  You won't be young and abroad forever.", "Just tell them you are acting out of an abundance of caution, you wouldn't want him to fear for his safety. What a jerk!!\nNTA", "NTA unless they are going to pay you to be his social director and then you can set up his activities. He managed to get to Africa but can't figure out how to speak to people or find things he wants to do on his own? \n\nWhy should you have to do things that you aren't interested in just to \"support\" him? If he can't or won't do what you want to do, then he is on his own. How much of their free time are Grace and the advisor spending with him to do things?", "Nta.  Thomas is not your child and is not your responsibility. He can join any activity he wants on his own. Not your job to take care of him.", "He is a baby. You are not his dad. Nta..", "Don't you know, OP is only supposed to do activities Thomas likes.  So that he can be safe and enjoy life on HIS terms.       s/", "You haven't made any attempt to build bridges outside of your own interests but, if I've read correctly, ***neither has Thomas.*** If he's really that helpless, then he's just not prepared to live on his own, let alone in a foreign country, and he needs to go back home until he's grown up some more.", "You don't need to plan things outside of your own interest. It's kind to accept an invite to something you wouldn't have planned but don't hate, but you don't need to take the lead on it. You're not responsible for him.", "Tell advisor and Grace that you don't feel safe with him--if he can spout that garbage about you, you can spout it about him(and honestly after he made the accusation I wouldn't feel safe for wondering what accusation he'd make next).", "Thomas is 20, Grace & OP are 23.  No Idea how old Advisor is.", "Doesn\u2019t matter 20 or 23 this person is too old to have an advisor tell another person to include them in activities.  And to be whining about it. Nope that\u2019s not age appropriate .", "NTA\u2026since when did it become the norm to have a \u201cbuddy\u201d for an adult?  Why doesn\u2019t Grace make sure Thomas is included? Why doesn\u2019t the advisor?  Just because you and Thomas are both make dues not make you his keeper.  You tried to include him.  He complained.  Then complained when you did not.  Tell them you do not have time for petty bull crap.", "NTA!!! You aren't responsible for Thomas or what he does or doesn't do. You tried to include him only for him to turn it into something negative.", "You're not the cruise director here, it isn't your job to make sure everyone is having fun.", "NTA. I'd also potentially start writing up a letter to highlight the issues and give it to the advisor and keep a copy. Your job is not to be a babysitter, you went out of your way to include him in your activities only to get him go behind your back to criticise you for doing things he didn't like. Now he's going behind your back to criticise you for not including you in personal activities that have nothing to do with the program that he's previously complained about.\n\nIt's unprofessional and absolutely inappropriate for both of those people to approach you about it, let alone criticise you about it or imply you need to do better. at very best they should have told him to talk to you and ask you to do more things and that to inform him it's entirely up to you what you do and who you do them with outside of the job you're there for.", "NTA. You tried, you guys are different, and you shouldn\u2019t be forced to have interaction with him. He\u2019s a big boy, he can go out in his own.", "Oh, man, I was totally starting to think that you should've tried something else with him, but if he's determined to not eat the food and not explore the countryside, it's starting to get tough.  I mean, what are you gonna do, go to Africa to play the video games?", "Why can't he plan his own outings? Do they want you to reorganize your free time around his preferences? What's stopping him from making his own plans?\n\nI think you need to rind them that you are there for academic reasons, not a cruise ship fun director or camp counselor.", "They're all from the same American institution, so I assumed none were native to the country they're doing fieldwork in. I don't see indication they all aren't -- they would theoretically be of different races and backgrounds, but they all know and should be used to at his point, a Western context for engagement/interaction.", "So, has he ever tried to plan something that he is interested in and included you in that?  Or does he expect you to plan everything and make sure it caters to what he likes whether you enjoy it or not?", "NTA. Did you ask what exactly you are suppose to do if he doesn\u2019t feel safe in your company? It would seem to me that his perception of safety should be their priority. You should not have to curtail your activities to accomplish that for him.", "NTA. Grace or Thomas can equally plan things to do. Enjoy your time!", "Tell them it works both ways. Did he make any plans to include you in his hobbies? He also can plan something non-athletic. Why the mental load of organising should be on you? \nOffer them that if he invite you somewhere you will go. Otherwise you will stick to do what you enjoy and he\u2019s welcome to come with you, but not to complain", "That is exactly what I came here to say. I suspected they wanted you to cater to Thomas which is BS.  You tried to do the nice thing and include him, but that\u2019s not enough. That\u2019s the problem with being \u201cinclusive\u201c, people take it way to far. Edit to say NTA.", "NTA, you tried, he whined. It\u2019s probably time for your advisor to baby sit him.", "What's not inclusive about sports, outdoor activities, eating new foods, meeting new people?\n\nTell the advisor that you tried and Thomas just refuses to join and complains. So you decided it wasn't worth your effort of trying to come up with activities centered around him.\n\nNTA", "thomas is gay so this theory is not possible", "She might still be his target. For the swaddling.", "OMG that's even worse, nothing stopping them from planning things specifically that one whinger will enjoy and inviting that whinger. Not your job.", "Nta, you're not a babysitter", "NTA being some random man's babysitter is not part of your scholarly evaluation, and if you think it's being treated that way you should take some serious action", "NTA  \n\nThomas needs to take the effort's he's putting into compaining and do something.  You tried, he complained.  You stopped. He complains more.  What to do?  (I'd put it that way whent they complain at you, you tried and Thomas complained...)", "NTA. You're there not to be a babysitter, just let them be.", "Start filing complaints that the others don\u2019t plan events for you. Document everything. Send a daily email on how they aren\u2019t being inclusive and a good role model to you. Every effing day send an email. \n\nTell them how them ganging up on you hurts your feelings. Tell them they are creating an hostile environment. Tell them you are afraid to speak up. Every damn day."]}
