I am into mountain climbing, white water rafting, and sports. I like going for runs in the morning and trying new foods, and I am fairly sociable so I have made friends at the host org. Thomas, on the other hand, is not athletically inclined whatsoever, and has seriously struggled whenever I tried to include him in my free time activities. He complained to our advisor that he didn\u2019t feel safe when accompanying me on said activities, but never raised those opinions to me.

Plus he said he didn\u2019t like the activities you do\u2026 but then he complains when he\u2019s not invited? He needs to sort himself out", "NTA.\n\nThey may have viewed you as the AH because of the way you presented your efforts. It could be better to focus on the fact that you made the efforts to include him in the activities but that they weren\u2019t appreciated.", "NTA. If it was just a case of you not having the same interests, I would say the kind thing would still be to include him, by at least extending the invitation so he was free to join or not the activities you are participating in. \n\nBut it goes beyond different personalities and interests - Thomas has expressed he does not feel safe on said activities, going behind your back to a superior to do so. When you take this note and stop invitations so he does not feel pressured to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable, he again goes behind your back to complain. He sounds very immature for not just having a civil conversation with you about how he feels. His feelings aren\u2019t wrong, but his way of handling them is.\n\nI would be inclined to turn it back on the advisor and Grace. Have they been inviting Thomas to their social activities? If not, why are you the only one being expected to take responsibility for another student\u2019s experience who you have no supervisory capacity over or responsibility for mentoring? And does Thomas make efforts to socialise with you by making suggestions for you two to hang out?\n\nI would further point out that you have only been taking advantage of opportunities with the host org that were equally open to Thomas - it is not your fault that you are taking responsibility of making the most of your opportunities there while Thomas isn\u2019t.", "NTA. He literally said he doesn\u2019t want to be included. You need to point out that you did put in effort, but they weren\u2019t appreciated by him. Ask them what they think you should do, when he considers the activities you like \u201cdangerous\u201d", "NTA.  Thomas is not your younger sibling, your mentee, your pupil, your protege, or your disciple, who you might have some responsibility to help along.  Thomas is an adult who needs to take responsibility for his own social life.\n\n How can you include someone in activities when they so completely fail at communicating with you that they can\u2019t even tell you that they\u2019re uncomfortable or scared?  It doesn\u2019t sound like there is a way you can please Thomas - he finds the things you like unappealing or frightening, but he\u2019s also grouchy about you not bringing him along.\n\nIt would be kind and generous for you to invite him to non-physical activities you do, but frankly I think his whining to mummy no matter what you do has not earned him that consideration.  In your shoes, I think I would do it anyway, though, for one simple reason - academia is a small world, as is research generally, and having an advisor who is anything less than fully enthusiastic about you and your ability to be a team player can be devastating.", "NTA. He's 20 let him FITFO", "NTA, because you have tried to include him in your activities and it just doesn\u2019t suit him. \n\nHowever maybe you could try to connect through his interests? He\u2019s obviously finding things lonely and because he\u2019s struggling to connect with people it\u2019s only gonna get worse. If you find some way to connect with him or introduce him to others in the host organization then he likely won\u2019t complain to those above you. \n\nThat said it\u2019s not your responsibility and you\u2019re not preventing him from meeting people, you just have an easier time connecting because you share common interests.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to entertain. \nYou included him before and he complained so you stopped including him. Sounds reasonable.", "Nta Thomas don't like activities you do and he complains to advisor now he not happy you don't want to do anything with him. Why don't Thomas find a new friends who have same interest as him to hangout with. He already adult he should look after himself not just waiting for someone to make friends for him. You need to talking to your advisor about how you invite him out with you but he don't like it so you stop do it.", "NTA Definitely explain to your advisor that you have tried to include Thomas; after he complained about it, you stopped including him since he said nothing to you about it, but rather went to the advisor instead. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to change your free time activities, so it would be stressful to continue to try to include him in things that he doesn\u2019t like. Perhaps Thomas should be moved to Grace\u2019s city, so that he would be happier.", "NTA.  You're not his cruise director.  Obviously he was ill equipped to make a big trip like this and the age difference is showing.  Ask the advisor where its written in your contract you have to entertain this kid continuously.", "It's not your job to babysit another adult. Grace needs to stay out of this period. Your advisor needs to deal with Thomas. NTA. He probably shouldn't be there if he feels unsafe.", "NTA. Remind everyone that Thomas is an adult. You never volunteered to be his babysitter nor did anyobe disclose that being his sitter was a cobdition of your degree profram. Point out that if he needs someone to hold his hand, then he shouldnt be living/studying/working overseas.", "NTA by American standards.  However, American standards aren't universal --  various African and Asian cultures are well known for emphasizing the interests of the group over the individual.\n\nDo you have to try harder with Thomas?  No one can make you.  But it's a good skill to grow and have in your arsenal for the rest of your life.\n\nBtw, you don't have to make Thomas social or athletic.  That would be great, but even for Grace and advisor, that's more a hope than an expectation.  You just have to be willing to include him even though he complains about everything.  Think of it like family -- people have to be truly horrible to be kicked out.  If they're just whiny and unpleasant, they're still included in family get-togethers.\n\nAll you need to do is invite Thomas, and smile and nod and think about something else when he whines.  Pretty sure that's what a lot of people do around him -- and frankly another one of those little life hacks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not his nanny or big brother. If they care so much, they can invite him to his activities.", "NTA. He is not your responsibility. Carry on.", "NTA.  You tried and got rebuffed.  You do not need to try again.  Thomas is an adult and he needs to act like one, as does Grace.", "NTA\n\nI am close to saying NAH because it sounds like Thomas definitely has a different understanding of the dynamics and Grace and the Advisor might be agreeing with his interpretation. So you might be wrong about the expectations of your time there. \n\nYou don't view yourself as his mentor, but maybe your advisor does? It sounds like Thomas thought he had to go do things with you when you invited him. It might be a good idea to set up a meeting (in person or zoom) with your advisor in a way that no one else will be there and state that you think there has been a misunderstanding and you want to clarify. You viewed the situation as 2 students who happen to be in the same place, with no expectation of you overseeing or being responsible for Thomas beyond you being 2 humans living together. But was there the expectation that you would be supervising or mentoring Thomas, because you were not informed of that. \n\nI have been a grad student that did not realize I had inherited 2 undergrads until people were talking to me about them having too much down time. It is not fair, but it is worth a check to make sure you were not told and to clear the air so that hopefully the advisor can still provide a good reference as needed. Approach the conversation calmly and focus on making sure you understand the expectations, and you can state after your advisor has spoken: that you are sorry for the miscommunication but you took this project on as a student and did not expect or agree to supervisor or mentor anyone else. You are here if Thomas has an emergency, but you cannot run Thomas's schedule especially for social activities.", "You've covered my top two reactions quite well - the guy obviously talks more to them so why aren't they looking after him socially? Why should you keep inviting him to your activities when you leave him feeling unsafe? OP, NTA, and I hope you otherwise enjoy this experience!", "If they are both so nice and believe in inclusiveness so much, they should have no problem being Thomas\u2019s friend/caretaker/security blanket. But if they are only interested in virtue signaling, it is way easier just to make Thomas OP\u2019s problem.", "Try to think of it as a leadership exercise. Socially, do you owe him any further courtesy? Probably not. You reached out with your interests and he complained. Professionally, it\u2019s a good look if you help a colleague adapt and integrate. This is an essential skill in academia these days but if you move to industry like you say, leadership is financially rewarded. \n\nEven in an English speaking country, the culture shock can be quite severe so you may be doing him a solid if you help break the isolation", "NTA\n\nYou are both adults. You are not responsible for him. Moreover he complained when you DID include him. You are damned either way. He needs to grow up.", "NTA if he want's too hangout he can invite you to something he is interested in.", "NTA\n\n\"He then also complained to my advisor that I was excluding him and preventing him from bonding with the host org.\" ..

You have included him, but you are not his mother or caretaker.  It sounds like he does not have the emotional maturity to be a participant in this academic program.\n\nOn second though: you might want to schedule a one on one with your advisor to sort this out and explain your side (because who knows what they\u2019re saying).  Currently you are the odd one out in this program, although it appears you are thriving.  The last thing you want is for your advisor to have a bad opinion of you (could affect being invited back, references, opportunities passed on, etc).  Currently you are being scapegoat for this man\u2019s inability to thrive in this environment due to his own issues.  You need to get in front of this ASAP.", "NO! You are Not the Ass, if they are that concerned than \u201cthey\u201d need to include him\u2026 you already did and he complained.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA ask them point blank what your salary for being a grown man\u2019s babysitter will be?", "NTA\nThis triangulation is concerning. I'd address that with your advisor. You have made efforts to include Thomas in social activities outside of the academic assignment. The result has been his complaining and demanding that you both provide recreational services for him and change your plans to align with his preferences- through third parties.\n\nYour advisor needs to deal with Thomas. Advisor needs to clarify what the requirements and expectations are as participants in the program. \n\nYou are justified to stop making efforts to include him in your free time activities. He can and should make his own plans. Your reward for trying has been his creating and spreading drama throughout your small group. Your privacy, autonomy and comfort are being attacked on two fronts. If Thomas needs babysitting and remedial lessons on adult professional direct communication, that's your advisor's problem, not yoirs.", "Totally agree with you! You said what I would have\u2026", "Your first line is true but all the people in this story are Americans, so it's a bit moot. I sincerely hope the host organization is homegrown and not Americans abroad, but OP has clearly demonstrated they're able to connect with different types of people and cultures...when they have similar interests. Which is how everyone makes friends.\n\nI do think people who live fast should consider slowing down to meet new people who don't move as fast as them, but there is no reference to Thomas trying to move faster (assuming he can) in your response and it's hard to figure out why it's OP's job to include Thomas and not Thomas' job to connect with OP? Why isn't it Grace's job to coddle him?\n\nI know the dynamics are different when it's expats abroad (small community, sometimes need to adjust how you normally do things), but it's bizarre how OP needs to be the leader here. They're only three years older, too, same age as Grace, so it's not like they're some seasoned academic and expert in the country they're in. Thomas just feels left out because they aren't doing what he wants (even though he hasn't vocalized that - OP did invite him to things, he just didn't like them) and he's brooding rather than trying to fix his own situation. Personally, I've met this type before and him complaining to the advisor and Grace to make OP out to be the problem makes me completely unsympathetic.", "Are you sure?  Thomas is American, but I don't believe Grace and the advisor are."]}
