It's sad that friend isn't listening.  Reality will present itself shortly.  You may want to avoid being the shoulder to cry on.", "Nta at all and self referencing as \u201cyour other mom\u201d is a great way to ensure those kids despise her.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is projecting her desire for motherhood onto two kids that aren't hers.

You're right, and if you didn't tell her, she would have found out the hard way.", "One of the most dangerous things she can do is try to force a parental relationship with those kids when there is none. You tried to reason with her, she is going to find out the hard way- likely by hurting the kids and overstepping on their boundaries by trying to force the 'I'm your second mother' stuff.\n\nNTA, someone had to tell her. Up to her what she does now, I'm guessing she'll push full steam ahead and it will be really rough on the kids.", "NTA - you've got a better idea of what a step-parent is than she does.  She would benefit from reading some books and a step-parent support group.  The kids most likely will push back strongly if she tries to be their mum immediately.  She also needs to talk to her future husband to see what kinds of boundaries he's going to have regarding their relationship (is she allowed to discipline without his consent, etc.)  Especially since he's got such a good relationship with his ex.", "NTA \n\n\nBut I would just stick to \"Make sure you talk to your fiance about your role with the kids\".", "NTA\n\nSounds like a case of shooting the messenger, in that you told her something she wasn't in the right mindset to hear.  Hopefully she comes around before she ruins the potential relationship she can have with those two little ones.", "Nta. A parent child relationship doesn't just pop into existence like magic.", "NTA. If she pushes too hard and puts HERSELF in the mom role (without the kids\u2019 consent), she\u2019s going to push them away and ruin her relationship with them, and possibly with their dad. Parental relationships HAVE to develop naturally\u2014if she goes into this expecting to be mom 2 she is going to have a terrible time. \n\nShe needs to talk to her fianc\u00e9 about what her role with the kids will be, not only for the kids\u2019 sake but for the bio parents as well! Not every parent is comfortable with their partner parenting their kids! \n\nMaybe you can gently suggest to the fianc\u00e9 to talk about this with her?

It takes years to form that type of relationship where those kids feel comfortable enough to considering her their third parent.

She has to be prepared for that.", "NTA. From a step-parent perspective, you are absolutely right. Those kids already have 2 biological parents who they've grown up with so far. That biological bond cannot be replicated. She may be a wonderful step-parent, and the kids may grow to adore her in time, but a marriage certificate isn't a magic wand. It doesn't bestow any rights on her when it comes to those kids.\n\nHer reaction to your little bit of reality is concerning. If these kids initially reject her (and they might. This marriage will be the nail in the coffin for any dreams of their parents getting back together) is she going to throw a strop then? \n\nYour timing may not have been the best.

She needs to play it right if she really wants them to enjoy being around her.", "I would say NAH. You\u2019re not living with them so you don\u2019t know the depth of the dynamic. Yes, she\u2019s probably aware of the work it\u2019s going to take to develop a good relationship. But she\u2019s clearly excited to have a role in these kids lives as a bonus mom, so I do see how you kind of ruined the mood when you said that. You\u2019re not wrong, but she\u2019s not wrong for being excited about it.", "NTA. Getting married isn\u2019t going to magically change the existing relationship dynamic. She can try for being a friend of sorts but the  likelihood she will be mom is slim to nil.", "NTA. If she goes in w/ this attitude it is going to blow up in her face. \n\nShe is incredibly selfish. This is a big change for these kids that they have no control over. If she comes in shooting confetti w/ a banner, \"I'm Your Mommy Now Too!\" She is going to immediately alienate the kids,  hurt her husband's  relationship w/ his kids, and hurt the co-parentng relationship. They are living breathing human beings who have their own needs and wants and routines. The more she messes up a healthy routine, the worse it is for the kids. They are not some dolls that she can play with or puppies that will show her unconditional live if gives them a lot of attention and feeds thwm scraps under the table.\n\nThe best any step parent can do, especially if the relationship w/ existing parents is good, is to back off and develop relationships with the kids slowly. Support them in ways that works for the kids and fit their needs, not hers\n\nI apologize for the length and for preaching to the choir. I just find it heartbreaking when a step-parent comes into children's lives and takes away their routine and security and adds in strife out of completley selfish reasons when life could be so much happier for everyone if they thought of the kids needs instead of their own selfish desires.", "I'll go ahead and play the dissenting opinion and say you're the asshole.\n\nAt least from the way you phrased it, it doesn't sound like she asked your opinion.  If shes excited about something and happy, and you just came in to say something with the only purpose of shitting on her parade.  Yea, you're kind of being an asshole.\n\nWhether you're right or not is kind of irrelevant, if your friend is happy and excited about something, let her be.  It's not like it's the selling point of why she is in the relationship.", "Nta, relationships develop over time. They may view her as a bonus mom eventually but it certainly won't happen the moment the marriage certificate is signed.", "NTA. She's going to get too pushy and alienate them if she's not careful", "NTA.  I feel sorry for those kids because they are about to have their world implode because your AH friend is going to push herself onto them instead of allowing the relationship to develop naturally.  Those kids are going to end up hating her.", "NTA. You are being realistic. She really should check her expectations, or she is in for a major disappointment, not to mention what such expectations will do to the poor children. Children have one set of parents, max. What she can hope for, in time, is to be a valuable adult that the children can rely on.", "Are you a parent or a stepparent? I don\u2019t know-it sounds like she\u2019s excited to get married and is excited to be a stepparent. Those are positive things. She may already be secretly terrified that the kid thing won\u2019t go well (who wouldn\u2019t be) and you pushed on a sore spot. Honestly, while you aren\u2019t wrong in what you said, neither is she wrong to move forward with positivity. In that frame of mind, you\u2019re throwing cold water in her joy and that is an AH move. I think you are wrong in the spirit of friendship and while it  can be annoying to be sidekick to someone who refuses to remove the blinders, what\u2019s your real motivation here? Really think about that. What if it was to help her manage this the best she can? What if you said to her that you were sorry but that you were feeling too fearful of the situation and you want the best for her and then did some research to find a couple good books both for her and for him about this kind of transition. Be her cheerleader and secret support. Kids at that age actually can navigate to another mom-type figure.

You are a realist.", "NTA- because this seems like your friend has very unrealistic expectations of these kids. She's not just excited to be a stepmom, she's expecting to be treated exactly the same as their bio mom which just isn't realistic. It sounds like the relationship is still new to these kids, and they're old enough to be deciding how they feel about people in their life. This reads like the \"before\" story of many posts we see where step children resent their step parent for being overbearing, and expecting to be treated no different than a bio parent despite not actually putting in the work to bond or understand what the kid wants. I'm not saying that will definitely happen here but there's some aspects that seem to point that way. Infertility in a step parent is something I've seen in multiple posts as well, and those people often expect the step child to fill the role of \"replacement child\". They try to guilt the kid into loving them and treating them as a second bio mom/dad because they can't have kids of their own. I think it's fair of you to warn your friend that her expectations are not very reasonable, especially since she doesn't have a motherly relationship with these kids now. Does she think once she married their dad some switch will flip and she becomes mom 2.0? She's in for a rough awakening.", "NTA. The woman is a dreamer.

She's going to have to nurture that relationship into existence and even then she'll likely never really be like a second mom. It happens but that isn't the typical outcome. That sounds like a situation that might become toxic very quickly. Does her fiance know about this expectation?", "NTA. Sounds like she needed a reality check and you did pretty gently. Step parents pushing themselves on kinds that have already been involved in family breakups doesn\u2019t always go that well. She\u2019ll need to be patient if she wants to earn their trust/ affection.", "NTA - She can be mum number 2.\n\nJust reiterate to her that she should not force the children to view her that way, if she tries to overcompensate, she'll push them away and have the opposite effect.\n\nThe only way it will be successful is not being the overbearing stepparent and the kids have a right to have boundaries with her, it's simply not a case of it being how she wants it to be.

This guy has 50% custody of his children, there's no way she hasn't met them before or done things with them before", "Being excited makes people disregard necessary boundaries though, Dad's new wife won't automatically be a new \"Mom\" and if OP's friend doesn't realize that she's gonna be disappointed first and probably pissed second if the kids don't play along like she'd like them to...and she becomes\nanother shitty step that can't understand why the kids won' accept her.\n\nNTA, that woman sounds pretty selfcentred, doubt she'll givevit another thought though...", "Right? Also, If they are getting married and he has 50% custody I assume that she has already spent time with the children and has a relationship with them. Isn't it better to have someone who is really excited to be a step parent, and wants to engage the children then someone who doesn't care? The children seem pretty important to her future husband, I bet her wanting to be a mom is a big part of their relationship, and what he was looking for in a future wife. \n\nOP's friend seems naive, but that doesn't make it ok in my opinion to say \"you don't know what you're doing and it won't work\".", "It also depends on what OP's friend means by \"mom number 2\". Is she saying that she's excited to do fun things with them, play, watch their sporting events, things like that? Or is she saying \"treat me like your mom, call me mom, I now have an equal right to do everything that your mom does\".\n\nIf she's just excited to be a fun person in their life, I don't see any harm.

After all, he brought her into the family. \n\nI think a meeting with the kids' parents needs to happen. They can discuss ways to help that relationship build.

I'm guessing neither her husband-to-be, much less his ex, is going to at all be happy if/when she starts insisting the kids also call her Mum and tries to be an equal third party in the parenting decisions. \n\nIn any case, there's really nothing you can do about it beyond what you've said. My HOPE is that this conversation prompted her to say something to her husband-to-be about it and that caused him to have a real conversation with her about things. \n\nBut in any case - you were right, and either she can learn that now or (as seems likely) learn it the hard way after she gets married.", "NTA\n\nSomeone needed to tell her.

I love her like she's my own. But I'm not Mom #2. Her mom is in her life. She and dad coparent well together. So my role as a stepparent is to support them. That's how I think it should be. \n\nIt would be a different story is mom wasn't in the picture for some reason.", "NTA. She is being incredibly unrealistic and she is possibly in for a harsh awakening. I think it's great she wants to be involved and adores her future step children. However, it sounds like the kids are  lukewarm at best with her. Relationships take time to develop, if they even develop at all. She's living in a fantasy if she thinks she's going to just march on in and be mom number 2. Is that even wanted by both kids and parents? If parents are still on good terms and co-parent well, chances are they are not going to even ask for her input. The kids will likely just go to their parents first. I think what you said is what she needed to hear in order to avoid potential disappointment and heartbreak down the road.", "NTA oh man she has a brutal wake up call coming!", "NTA and she needs to except that she may never be considered mother by them and that is entirely their choice and she has no say in it. If she tries to force this by thinking marriage automatically makes her their mom then she may end up ruining the marriage. She needs to realize how rude it is to their actual mom that she thinks a ring gives her equal footing.", "You're not wrong, but was this seriously the best time you could think of to bring it up? The day she got engaged? Reality isn't the top thing on her mind right now. If she's usually a rational person you should have waited.", "NTA. She will be shocked when the kids still call her by her first name and say they already have a mom and don\u2019t want another.", "NTA And she\u2019s a whole red flag. And I hope he understands the disruption this may cause his kids and his beautiful coparenting relationship.", "NTA but it\u2019s entirely possible she may become an important part of their lives. She just needs to be realistic. She needs to build that relationship. Reddit has weird views on step-parents but she could absolutely be a 2nd mom to them but she has to EARN it. It\u2019s not a given.", "NTA.  Your friend needs to check her expectations because she's only going to harm her relationship with the kids and end up disappointed.  She's being unrealistic.", "NTA. Speaking as a step mum and a mum, being a step mum is hard and it hurts. She's not going to be the wonderful step mum straight off the bat. She needs a relationship with them and a good one at that.", "NTA.  Reddit is littered with posts about step-parents pushing their parenting fantasies on their step-kids (living ex or passed).  Usually doesn\u2019t end well.  I hope for the kids sake that her fianc\u00e9 and her have a thorough discussion about this.", "NTA, and you need to give the fiance a head's up what she is planning on here. Because this situation will go south REALLY quick.", "NTA if your friend trys to force a mum relationship she WILL drive the kids away,  step parents need to respect tge children's boundaries, build a slow trust as another adult and wait for a natral relationship to develop anything else is almost always a disaster from a step parent who made it work!", "THIS! If friend insists on being a step-mom and being treated as another mother, she's going to make her step-children upset and resentful and try and avoid  her. She needs to respect that these things may take time and she can't force anything.   NTA", "The friend is selfish as fuck here. She is projecting her desires on the kids because being a mom is what ***she*** wants and doesn't give a shit about how the kids feel. We didn't get details of the conversation but no mention of how she plans to *develop* that kind of relationship. She seems to talk about it like its a foregone conclusion.\n\nEvery relationship takes effort to develop and maintain. No matter what it is. Coming in from the outside and being the adult, she needs to allow the kids to dictate things way more than any other kind of relationship. Her goal should be to at minimum be an adult they can trust even if its not as a parent. That could possibly be way more valuable and open them up to telling her things that they might be too ashamed or afraid to tell their actual parents. In rare circumstances, it could save their lives.\n\nThe friend does not seem interested in that though. Just in the title and her fantasy of being a mom.", "I didn't start seeing my stepmom as a bonus mom until I was fully grown & we were able to have a relationship that wasn't parental in nature.", "I might even warn the fianc\u00e9. Maybe save the kids a few years of this mess.", "For most people it takes about 9 months to get it started. I wonder if friend has a current relationship with the kids.", "If someone gets giddy with causing harm, people have the right to correct them regardless if they were asked for their opinion. The way this friend is thinking, she can cause emotional distress with the children & both parents; she's can create conflict if the kids don't respond the way she wants them to (either internally or externally).", "Sometimes people need to have their unrealistic parade shat on, especially when it involves children. We have seen plenty of posts on here of the predictable outcome of this attitude and behavior by stepparents. It\u2019s actively harmful to everyone involved, including the deluded stepparent. This is not the sort of subject matter to just \u201clet someone be happy and excited\u201d.", "Yeah just look at... About half the posts in this sub.", "Wow! Integrating her into his home and children\u2019s lives is absolutely something they need to be talking about.", "Because she realizes that signing a marriage certificate doesn\u2019t automatically make someone a \u201cmom.\u201d", "She has a relationship, a good one, but not a parent-child relationship. I know they like her and they are enjoying spending time with her, she's a wonderful person, but I don't think that they are going to call her mom the day she marries their dad.", "Did she specifically say that's what she wanted to be called? Because as a live-in girlfriend with someone who has kids, I do get to experience \"some\" \"mom\" type experiences that I wouldn't normally get. Example: I get to cheer them on at sports. I can't just go to a random school and do that to stranger's kids. But it also doesn't make me \"mom\".", "I agree, the only reason I told her these things is because I didn't want to see her disappointed and do anything stupid that might ruin the relationship with the kids or the dad.", "I'm sure there will be plenty of crapping. But with her unrealistic expectations, she's going to add extreme disappointment. Those are not her children, they have a mother of their own. If she starts out trying to *be* there mother, they're likely to resent the hell out of her. OP can be excited with her while also being a sound voice of reason that the friend clearly needs right now.", "She already has a relationship with the kids and they like her. They spend time together but she's more like a family friend. The way she has it in her mind is that she will automatically be a mum and have the same rights and responsibilities and I don't think that's realistic. The kids are currently calling her by her name, I think it's unlikely it will change because of the marriage. It will be lovely if does change, but if it doesn't and she pushes it it may ruin the relationship with them.", "I fully expect to fuck up sometimes with my boyfriend's kids and their dad. It's HARD figuring out where lines are, the right thing to say at the right time. You'll be more helpful to give her suggestions on how to fix it when she does."]}
