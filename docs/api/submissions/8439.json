It's not the house we live in, thank god. 4 Years ago, my husband wanted to take on this project, and I begged him not to. Eventually, he wore me down, and we decided to do the renovation together. \n\nMy husband comes from a wealthy family. I do not. So even though he could have easily afforded it, we decided to get a loan with the bank, so the house would be equally owned by the both of us.\n\nMy husband insists on doing the entire renovation ourselves (and I mean EVERYTHING). This means everything takes incredibly long, because it's just the two of us.\n\nMy husband loves this renovation project. But I absolutely hate it. Everytime we are renovating together, we argue so bad, that it leads to huge fights and words that can never be taken back. \nSo we decided that I would only be renovating for 1 day per week, Saturdays. To minimize the arguing. \nOff and on, he takes a month of form work to be able to renovate full time. \n\nHERE COMES THE ISSUE\nHe wants me to pay him by the hour for his work in the renovation. He feels it is unfair for him to a lot more work and the house still being equally owned by the two of us.\n\nI have no money. Every dime I make goes into that house for materials etc. I haven't been able to save one euro in those 4 Years, I live from paycheck to paycheck. He has money. Heaps. \n\nOn the one hand, I can understand that he feels it is unfair, but on the other, I feel like I have been pressured in this whole thing, I hated it even before we started and it has since been a big black cloud in our lives. I feel like maybe he should just let it go and work in the house because he insisted on doing this project, and because we are married and would want for us to have a nice home. \n\nI have been paying him with all the little money I got extra, like when I work side jobs etc. But I can't keep this up. \n\nWow sorry, the tldr got a little long.

Unless it's for some back handed tax break or something, there is no need. I get he is taking time from work, and losing money that way, but this was his choice.", "NTA - He wants you to pay him for something he pressured you into doing?\n\nSounds like he's not only wealthy, but also entitled. How amenable would be to just selling the house as it is now? It sounds like it's putting a lot of pressure on your relationship.", "NTA. Try to get your husband to buy you out or even threaten to sell or give your share to someone else. You need to get out of this.", "What the fuck? Your husband wants YOU to pay HIM for the renovation? That you don't want to do? Why are you allowing this?? \n\nNTA. Stop enabling him, right now. Put your foot down and stand up for yourself.", "NTA. Why on earth would you be paying your HUSBAND to renovate a house that he also owns and that he wanted to renovate. No, no, no. NTA.", "Yea NTA. He has a crappy way of looking at this situation. He wanted the project more than you did so why they hell should he be paid for something he pressured you into because HE wanted it? Plus he's kind of an AH just for ignoring the obvious wage/money difference you all have but he still expects you to spend like you have the extra he does. He's inconsiderate.", "NTA - that\u2019s crazy to me that he expects you to pay him. Your marriage doesn\u2019t sound like a partnership to me. I get that not all marriages combine their income, but your situation does not sound like you two are a team. \n\nIf he\u2019s concerned about being paid he shouldn\u2019t be taking months off of work. That\u2019s also crazy to me. Like if you\u2019re going to pay anyone to renovate - pay a professional! It won\u2019t take as long as it\u2019s taking and he wouldn\u2019t need to take time off of work. \n\nHe needs to take responsibility for the choices he\u2019s making. He chose to renovate this house, he chose to do it without professional help, he chose to take time off of work for it.", "NTA. If he\u2019s so concerned with making money maybe he shouldn\u2019t take months off of work to renovate, which is ultimately his project and responsibility. I\u2019d offer to sell his half back to him if you really aren\u2019t into the project at all. But I\u2019m not married so idk", "I'm confused why you guys are married and he's still like this with money. Red flag! Money should be shared between the both of you that's part of marriage! Ehy doesn't he want to financially support you? I would want to support my husband if he was struggling and i wanst. I'd say he can buy you out of the house and do the reno himself. Or pay you in order to reno your hald of the house.", "NTA, he sounds entitled tbh. However, its putting strain on your relationship and that deserves a big talk. Because you sound like you're done with everything, if you can both wash your hands of it maybe do so and sell the place. and maybe a change of career might be up his alley? Idk but you're fine lovely. Good luck with what ever you do.", "**NTA**\n\nHis argument makes no logical sense. \n\nFirst of all, you didn't want any of this in the first place. He's asking you to pay him to work on an expensive, time-consuming, already-money-draining project that you neither asked for nor wanted to begin with. You did not request that he take the time off of work to get it done faster, that was his idea and choice. You did not, in other words, \"hire him\" to do this extra work. He doesn't get to demand that you pay him for a job you didn't hire him to do. And again, if his argument is that you would have to pay someone else if he weren't doing it . . . well, you didn't want to do the renovation in the first place, so no. You wouldn't have had to hire someone to do something that he pushed you into in the first place. And the work will still get done eventually if he doesn't take time off work, and you have not asked him to give up his paying work in order to do it more quickly. That was his idea. He can pay himself.\n\nSecondly, the idea that you are somehow getting some sort of advantage is ridiculous. You are equal co-owners of the property. Again, you did not request that he take time off to do the work more quickly. And once the work is all done, you are not going to end up with MORE HOUSE because he did it more quickly. He is not saving you money by taking time off work. Quite the opposite: he is already costing your household significantly through the loss of income, and now he wants you to pay him as well? So he thinks that this renovation that you only reluctantly agreed to should . . . cost you significantly more because he arbitrarily CHOSE to give up his income for no rational reason, thereby just making the whole endeavour cost more for both of you? Make it make sense.\n\nStop paying him. At all. He is not your employee. He is not working for you. He is your life partner, working on what is theoretically a \"home improvement project\" that benefits you both, but in reality mostly just benefits him because he's the only one who is getting any joy out of it, and it is costing you - the one who cannot financially afford it - a fortune on the face of it, as well as your emotional and mental health. Tell him that you're done; that for the sake of your marriage, and BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM, if he doesn't want to destroy your relationship permanently, going forward anything he chooses to do with this renovation is a choice he makes voluntarily and pays for himself unless he can demonstrate that it is an absolutely necessary cost. And that you need him to go back to work, because you are not carrying an entire household on your own so he can play at \"building us a house\" whilst not contributing to your family's actual needs. He can renovate on the weekends and holidays. \n\nYou are NTA, and you deserve so much better than this nonsense. It's okay to set down a reasonable boundary.", "Does he even love you?\n\nI remodel our homes myself and would never consider pressuring my SO to do work they hate or to pay me!\n\nSo strange.\n\nNTA", "NTA. he chose to renovate the house, if he wants to work on it, why should you pay him?", "NTA\n\nHe made you buy something you didn't want so he can have a fun project for himself, and now wants you to pay him for his time. Fuck that.\n\nI'd tell him I want nothing to do with the house any longer and that you want the house sold. In the future, never under any circumstances agree to buy something that requires work, cause he will try to hold it over you.", "NTA\n\nTalk to a lawyer. \n\nI'm guessing that you're in a Civil Law jurisdiction due to using Euros. In many civil law jurisdictions, there's a legal principle that \"no one is obligated to live in a community of goods\" which means, you should be able to sell your part of the house. His choice will be to buy you out himself or watch you sell to a stranger.\n\nOnce you know the legal side of things you can have another conversation with your husband. \n\nI'd also suggest marital counseling to sort out how you both will approach your family finances and other conflicts.", "NTA- It sounds like you made it pretty clear you didn't want to take on this project and you have communicated you hate doing it. If your husband is enjoying it and wants to continue I think that's up to him. But for him to ask you to pay extra is weird. It's like he's just treating your marriage like a business transaction. Maybe I just don't understand how marriages with split finances work though. We pool all our resources, time, and labor. Keeping track of who owes who money for labor so it all turns out equal sounds exhausting. I would imagine while he is there you are taking care of daily stuff. Cooking? Cleaning? Household shopping? Childcare if you have kids?  If so maybe he should pay you for doing that labor.", "NTA. Your husband is selfish and inconsiderate. He ignored your wishes and is now regretful about the responsibility he made you take on? Hell no. You need to find a way to get out of this - someone mentioned selling him your half - because this will only continue to bring both of you down.", "NTA it sounds like the house is his passion project and he is trying to make it like it\u2019s a joint decision because you will be rewarded with it. Your division of money sounds unequal in your marriage. Does he know of your finances and is he doing this so you have no extra money. It sounds like he might be making sure you don\u2019t have any financial resources.", "NTA. \n\n  \nIf you're going to pay him for his work on the renovation, he has to pay you for your work. \n\n  \nAs you hate doing the renovating, you get to charge a higher rate for your time than he does for his - make clear to him your rates will go up e very time his do.\n\nWhenever you work on Saturdays, he has to pay you double time - triple time if you work on Sundays or holidays.  \n\n\nSit down with him and work out how much he needs to pay you every week, and make clear that if he's insisting you pay him, the money he owes you - including back pay since I bet he hasn't been paying you up to now - needs to be in your account pronto.  You can pay him from what he pays you,  \n\n\nIf he starts complaining this is ridiculous and he shouldn't have to pay you, agree! and inquire why as a merried couple, either of you should pay the other one for their work on a house they jointly own.  \n\n\nPlease update.", "NTA. Tell him to buyout your half, including compensation for your labor.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYour husband pressured you into buying this house you didn't even want, decided (seemingly without your input) that the entire renovation would be done by the two of you, and now has the nerve to tell you to pay him? \n\nThis is insane and needs to stop. \n\nI do understand that given his wealth, you guys may have finances totally separate for that reason - I know this can be common in relationships where one partner has family money. But for him - the very wealthy man who WANTED TO DO THIS PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE - to decide that his very much not-wealthy wife needs to pay him to do these renovations, it honestly edges uncomfortably close to a form of financial abuse or control for me. \n\nFirst up, stop paying him. Now. Today. \n\nNext, sit down and talk to him and make it clear that you didn't want this house in the first place and you want it sold. If he wants to keep on with the house, he can pay for it with his money, period. \n\nAnd last, I'd give a quick think to your relationship as a whole, especially as it relates to money. It unsettles me quite a bit how he's apparently fine with his wife having no money to the point that she has to work side jobs and is insisting on payment on top of that. Does this attitude extend to anything else in your lives?", "\"You need to pay me to do the work on this project that only I originally wanted!\"\n\nHeck with that.\n\nI'd go so far as to suggest divorce.  It's his pet project, why should he be paid for the work?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2026 your husband wants YOU to pay HIM for work?\n\nYou\u2019re so much better than me. I would write up an itemized list for every chore or sexual favor in the house and submit it to him equal to the 8-hour work day just to be spiteful.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good idea but paying him is insanity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His answer: that doesn't matter because once it's finished and we sell, you will get an equal amount as me. And I guess he's right there. If we ever sell it, I will get the benefits as well. And I think that that's why I finally caved and agreed to pay him.\n\nI once told my dad about this, which was difficult for me because I don't want my dad to dislike my husband. He said: well why don't you have him write down his hours, agree on an hourly pay and count those hours for all the years to come. So if you do sell, you deduct those hours from your share.  This would get him off your back and you won't have to pay him for now.\n\nI'm thinking of discussing this with my husband. Maybe that's a great compromise.", "Not to defend him but the analogy doesnt really work. The issue is that they bought the house on a loan so she would have coownership. But hes doing all the work (time=money, not to mention labour) so is it really fair to have equal ownership of the house when he has sunk far more time and labour into it? \n\nAgain, I dont agree with him nor do I defend him Im just explaining his thought process because I feel a lot of people are acting as if his ask is outrageous when its not that bad. If taking out the loan to pay for the house was him compromising in favour of OP (if ive understood this correctly) and then him doing the majority of the work for the house its easy to see why he feels entitled to pay. \n\nI feel like a lot of info is missing, so I dont feel competent to give OP any actual advice except to not pay him. Op dont pay him. \n\nBut yeah, many questions such as why those arguments are starting? Why you agreed to renovating the house yourselves if you didnt actually want to? Whay did that convo look like?

Regardless of how much damage it is doing to your own personal finances? Does that actually sound like a good, caring, mutually beneficial relationship to you?\n\nKeeping things 50/50 is supposed to balance the TOTAL financial picture. If he came into the marriage with significantly more assets than you, is currently insisting that he gets to spend 100% of your income (which prevents you from accumulating your own savings), and the prenuptial means he could exit the relationship tomorrow with his savings intact and yours nonexistent - I gotta say, that sounds like a really lopsided \"fair\" to me.\n\nYou two started this renovation project with some assumptions that turned out to be untrue. (It happens to the best of us sometimes and there's not much point in assigning blame now.) But there IS NO WAY now to make things go the way you had planned.

Why is it worth doing? \n\nHe\u2019s not only not adding enough value to justify you paying him, he\u2019s not adding enough value to justify him doing the work at all. \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s likely not adding any value at all because his work is making the house sit vacant for years and his work is bad and is making the house lose value.

Are you going to be happy in the future after all the nonsense he's put you through with this house? Or will it just cause resentment?", "I think that idea you have of not paying rent ever again is blinding you to a lot of things.\n\nYou\u2019re paying double for rent and a mortgage while he spends years doing this work that should take months. \n\nEven once you do move in there are costs like insurance, taxes, and home maintenance that you wouldn\u2019t be responsible for if you paid him a flat rent. \n\nIf he bought you out, you could take that money and put it in a low risk investment where it could grow. \n\nYou currently have it invested in this house and you\u2019re letting your husband manage your investment poorly. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to sell the house there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll make a profit. It sounds like you\u2019re unlikely to when you consider even half of these things - the wasted years it sits vacant while he plays around doing unnecessary work or doing necessary work in the least efficient way possible, the subpar work you may need to pay contractors to redo, the potential damage his subpar work could cause, increased maintenance costs from his poor work, possible failed home inspections or having to reduce price because people won\u2019t want to pay a good price for a house with work like the windows you described, the hole you\u2019ll be in if you can\u2019t sell the house later or if you find out that his renovation will all have to be redone. Having to pay double in the future for rent and a mortgage if you have to move out before the house is sold or during renovations to fix his work.

And while he is working on the house in his free time, you are maintaining the house that you both live in which presumably he doesn\u2019t do as much work toward because he\u2019s busy with construction. Is he planning to pay you for cooking and cleaning? If not, he needs to gtfo and stop being so unreasonable. \n\nThe only other thing I could offer is completely divided finances where he buys you out of your part of the house.
