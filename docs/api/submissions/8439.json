It's not the house we live in, thank god. 4 Years ago, my husband wanted to take on this project, and I begged him not to. Eventually, he wore me down, and we decided to do the renovation together. \n\nMy husband comes from a wealthy family. I do not. So even though he could have easily afforded it, we decided to get a loan with the bank, so the house would be equally owned by the both of us.\n\nMy husband insists on doing the entire renovation ourselves (and I mean EVERYTHING). This means everything takes incredibly long, because it's just the two of us.\n\nMy husband loves this renovation project. But I absolutely hate it. Everytime we are renovating together, we argue so bad, that it leads to huge fights and words that can never be taken back. \nSo we decided that I would only be renovating for 1 day per week, Saturdays. To minimize the arguing. \nOff and on, he takes a month of form work to be able to renovate full time. \n\nHERE COMES THE ISSUE\nHe wants me to pay him by the hour for his work in the renovation. He feels it is unfair for him to a lot more work and the house still being equally owned by the two of us.\n\nI have no money. Every dime I make goes into that house for materials etc. I haven't been able to save one euro in those 4 Years, I live from paycheck to paycheck. He has money. Heaps. \n\nOn the one hand, I can understand that he feels it is unfair, but on the other, I feel like I have been pressured in this whole thing, I hated it even before we started and it has since been a big black cloud in our lives. I feel like maybe he should just let it go and work in the house because he insisted on doing this project, and because we are married and would want for us to have a nice home. \n\nI have been paying him with all the little money I got extra, like when I work side jobs etc. But I can't keep this up. \n\nWow sorry, the tldr got a little long.

Unless it's for some back handed tax break or something, there is no need. I get he is taking time from work, and losing money that way, but this was his choice.", "NTA - He wants you to pay him for something he pressured you into doing?\n\nSounds like he's not only wealthy, but also entitled. How amenable would be to just selling the house as it is now? It sounds like it's putting a lot of pressure on your relationship.", "NTA. Try to get your husband to buy you out or even threaten to sell or give your share to someone else. You need to get out of this.", "What the fuck? Your husband wants YOU to pay HIM for the renovation? That you don't want to do? Why are you allowing this?? \n\nNTA. Stop enabling him, right now. Put your foot down and stand up for yourself.", "NTA. Why on earth would you be paying your HUSBAND to renovate a house that he also owns and that he wanted to renovate. No, no, no. NTA.", "Yea NTA. He has a crappy way of looking at this situation. He wanted the project more than you did so why they hell should he be paid for something he pressured you into because HE wanted it? Plus he's kind of an AH just for ignoring the obvious wage/money difference you all have but he still expects you to spend like you have the extra he does. He's inconsiderate.", "NTA - that\u2019s crazy to me that he expects you to pay him. Your marriage doesn\u2019t sound like a partnership to me. I get that not all marriages combine their income, but your situation does not sound like you two are a team. \n\nIf he\u2019s concerned about being paid he shouldn\u2019t be taking months off of work. That\u2019s also crazy to me. Like if you\u2019re going to pay anyone to renovate - pay a professional! It won\u2019t take as long as it\u2019s taking and he wouldn\u2019t need to take time off of work. \n\nHe needs to take responsibility for the choices he\u2019s making. He chose to renovate this house, he chose to do it without professional help, he chose to take time off of work for it.", "NTA. If he\u2019s so concerned with making money maybe he shouldn\u2019t take months off of work to renovate, which is ultimately his project and responsibility. I\u2019d offer to sell his half back to him if you really aren\u2019t into the project at all. But I\u2019m not married so idk", "I'm confused why you guys are married and he's still like this with money. Red flag! Money should be shared between the both of you that's part of marriage! Ehy doesn't he want to financially support you? I would want to support my husband if he was struggling and i wanst. I'd say he can buy you out of the house and do the reno himself. Or pay you in order to reno your hald of the house.", "NTA, he sounds entitled tbh. However, its putting strain on your relationship and that deserves a big talk. Because you sound like you're done with everything, if you can both wash your hands of it maybe do so and sell the place. and maybe a change of career might be up his alley? Idk but you're fine lovely. Good luck with what ever you do.", "**NTA**\n\nHis argument makes no logical sense. \n\nFirst of all, you didn't want any of this in the first place. He's asking you to pay him to work on an expensive, time-consuming, already-money-draining project that you neither asked for nor wanted to begin with. You did not request that he take the time off of work to get it done faster, that was his idea and choice. You did not, in other words, \"hire him\" to do this extra work. He doesn't get to demand that you pay him for a job you didn't hire him to do. And again, if his argument is that you would have to pay someone else if he weren't doing it . . . well, you didn't want to do the renovation in the first place, so no. You wouldn't have had to hire someone to do something that he pushed you into in the first place. And the work will still get done eventually if he doesn't take time off work, and you have not asked him to give up his paying work in order to do it more quickly. That was his idea. He can pay himself.\n\nSecondly, the idea that you are somehow getting some sort of advantage is ridiculous. You are equal co-owners of the property. Again, you did not request that he take time off to do the work more quickly. And once the work is all done, you are not going to end up with MORE HOUSE because he did it more quickly. He is not saving you money by taking time off work. Quite the opposite: he is already costing your household significantly through the loss of income, and now he wants you to pay him as well? So he thinks that this renovation that you only reluctantly agreed to should . . . cost you significantly more because he arbitrarily CHOSE to give up his income for no rational reason, thereby just making the whole endeavour cost more for both of you? Make it make sense.\n\nStop paying him. At all. He is not your employee. He is not working for you. He is your life partner, working on what is theoretically a \"home improvement project\" that benefits you both, but in reality mostly just benefits him because he's the only one who is getting any joy out of it, and it is costing you - the one who cannot financially afford it - a fortune on the face of it, as well as your emotional and mental health. Tell him that you're done; that for the sake of your marriage, and BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM, if he doesn't want to destroy your relationship permanently, going forward anything he chooses to do with this renovation is a choice he makes voluntarily and pays for himself unless he can demonstrate that it is an absolutely necessary cost. And that you need him to go back to work, because you are not carrying an entire household on your own so he can play at \"building us a house\" whilst not contributing to your family's actual needs. He can renovate on the weekends and holidays. \n\nYou are NTA, and you deserve so much better than this nonsense. It's okay to set down a reasonable boundary.", "Does he even love you?\n\nI remodel our homes myself and would never consider pressuring my SO to do work they hate or to pay me!\n\nSo strange.\n\nNTA", "NTA. he chose to renovate the house, if he wants to work on it, why should you pay him?", "NTA\n\nHe made you buy something you didn't want so he can have a fun project for himself, and now wants you to pay him for his time. Fuck that.\n\nI'd tell him I want nothing to do with the house any longer and that you want the house sold. In the future, never under any circumstances agree to buy something that requires work, cause he will try to hold it over you.", "NTA\n\nTalk to a lawyer. \n\nI'm guessing that you're in a Civil Law jurisdiction due to using Euros. In many civil law jurisdictions, there's a legal principle that \"no one is obligated to live in a community of goods\" which means, you should be able to sell your part of the house. His choice will be to buy you out himself or watch you sell to a stranger.\n\nOnce you know the legal side of things you can have another conversation with your husband. \n\nI'd also suggest marital counseling to sort out how you both will approach your family finances and other conflicts.", "NTA- It sounds like you made it pretty clear you didn't want to take on this project and you have communicated you hate doing it. If your husband is enjoying it and wants to continue I think that's up to him. But for him to ask you to pay extra is weird. It's like he's just treating your marriage like a business transaction. Maybe I just don't understand how marriages with split finances work though. We pool all our resources, time, and labor. Keeping track of who owes who money for labor so it all turns out equal sounds exhausting. I would imagine while he is there you are taking care of daily stuff. Cooking? Cleaning? Household shopping? Childcare if you have kids?  If so maybe he should pay you for doing that labor.", "NTA. Your husband is selfish and inconsiderate. He ignored your wishes and is now regretful about the responsibility he made you take on? Hell no. You need to find a way to get out of this - someone mentioned selling him your half - because this will only continue to bring both of you down.", "NTA it sounds like the house is his passion project and he is trying to make it like it\u2019s a joint decision because you will be rewarded with it. Your division of money sounds unequal in your marriage. Does he know of your finances and is he doing this so you have no extra money. It sounds like he might be making sure you don\u2019t have any financial resources.", "NTA. \n\n  \nIf you're going to pay him for his work on the renovation, he has to pay you for your work. \n\n  \nAs you hate doing the renovating, you get to charge a higher rate for your time than he does for his - make clear to him your rates will go up e very time his do.\n\nWhenever you work on Saturdays, he has to pay you double time - triple time if you work on Sundays or holidays.  \n\n\nSit down with him and work out how much he needs to pay you every week, and make clear that if he's insisting you pay him, the money he owes you - including back pay since I bet he hasn't been paying you up to now - needs to be in your account pronto.  You can pay him from what he pays you,  \n\n\nIf he starts complaining this is ridiculous and he shouldn't have to pay you, agree! and inquire why as a merried couple, either of you should pay the other one for their work on a house they jointly own.  \n\n\nPlease update.", "NTA. Tell him to buyout your half, including compensation for your labor.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYour husband pressured you into buying this house you didn't even want, decided (seemingly without your input) that the entire renovation would be done by the two of you, and now has the nerve to tell you to pay him? \n\nThis is insane and needs to stop. \n\nI do understand that given his wealth, you guys may have finances totally separate for that reason - I know this can be common in relationships where one partner has family money. But for him - the very wealthy man who WANTED TO DO THIS PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE - to decide that his very much not-wealthy wife needs to pay him to do these renovations, it honestly edges uncomfortably close to a form of financial abuse or control for me. \n\nFirst up, stop paying him. Now. Today. \n\nNext, sit down and talk to him and make it clear that you didn't want this house in the first place and you want it sold. If he wants to keep on with the house, he can pay for it with his money, period. \n\nAnd last, I'd give a quick think to your relationship as a whole, especially as it relates to money. It unsettles me quite a bit how he's apparently fine with his wife having no money to the point that she has to work side jobs and is insisting on payment on top of that. Does this attitude extend to anything else in your lives?", "\"You need to pay me to do the work on this project that only I originally wanted!\"\n\nHeck with that.\n\nI'd go so far as to suggest divorce.  It's his pet project, why should he be paid for the work?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2026 your husband wants YOU to pay HIM for work?\n\nYou\u2019re so much better than me. I would write up an itemized list for every chore or sexual favor in the house and submit it to him equal to the 8-hour work day just to be spiteful.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good idea but paying him is insanity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If taking out the loan to pay for the house was him compromising in favour of OP (if ive understood this correctly) and then him doing the majority of the work for the house its easy to see why he feels entitled to pay. \n\nI feel like a lot of info is missing, so I dont feel competent to give OP any actual advice except to not pay him.

Did yall ever sit down and hash out a plan and how much each was ready to contribute?

He went to school for metalwork and just got a certificate for electrician. This last year he became a professional contractor and did jobs for his brother, who has been a contractor for over 15 years. So yes, he know alot about renovating a house. But it's not like he know everything. Often times in our house, he is learning on the fly. \nLike, he insisted on making the windows himself. I don't know in other countries, but here, you usually hire a window company to do it. You wait a few weeks, but in 2 or 3 days, they install your windows.\nFor us, it took about 6 months (and one window is still not installed), the glass is chipped here and there, and he welded (the window frame is in steel) to close to the glass so the embers melted in the glass. Can't fix that... If I'm paying a window company and this happened, I would NEVER pay for this unless they started over.", "That was actually one of my arguments. I told him: then you need to start paying me for keeping house. His answer: no, because that isn't something you can sell afterwards. Contrary to the house \"he\" is building.", "As the situation is now, we plan on living in the house for a few years. After that, we would sell it. \nWe split our finances on my request. When I was 12, my parents had a gruesome divorce that was an absolute sh*tshow because they had shared finances. So i vowed to never experience this myself. I would rather have a lifetime of less money than a messy divorce over money.\n\nA lot of people comments are saying he should buy me out, but I'm a bit reluctant to do that. Because at this point, I have put 4 Years of my life in this, and I also want to see this through. Those 4 Years would have been for nothing. Idk, that really stings.", "This is his hobby. He loves it. Why the F would he expect you to pay for that, especially when he already has a lot more money than you? Are you sure he didn't sink you into debt like this to control you and make it financially impossible for you to leave?", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried couples counselling? Perhaps that might be a way for him to realise just how difficult it is for both of you.", "Financial abuse. He pressures you into this project that takes all your money, then demands you pay for his work. If you want to divorce him you have no money to do so and are trapped. \n\nDad's cousin bought a Victorian house in a Rivertown many years ago, planned to renovate while living there. 20 yrs later moved to an apartment for a year and paid someone to renovate.\n\nYour thought of a few more years may not be realistic. An acquaintance and her husband bought a house to renovate and sell, he did most of the work but he hired people to do some things, can't remember what his cousin did that was more specialized and made sense to him to pay for.\n\nIn the 30s, 40s and 50s grandpa built a few houses mostly by himself but hired another guy to do the stucco because that guy had better stucco skills", "I don't know if anyone has told you this, but you don't deserve to be treated this way. Maybe you are so deep into this relationship that you are blinded to it, but from an outside perspective, this seems like emotional abuse.", "I gotta agree with schoobydoo42. This relationship sounds brutal.  Everything in your post points to him always having power over you in some way, AND being perfectly willing to use it to his advantage. \n\nI get what you mean when you say your relationship is more important than any amount of money. The problem is that people usually are happy to spend money when they say this line, instead of being manipulated into doing it. The money issue caused a rift specifically because he wanted it to, in the hopes that he could get you to cave in.", "He\u2019s showing you right now that he cares more about money than you.", "He's not convinced, he just wants to convince you", ">And that's the person that loves me the most... \n\nI mean, reading what you've written here, I'm not convinced he does. Does he love you or just want you around?", "You admit he's a bully. That's the first step to freedom.", "You got a couple  options. \nFirst off you never had an agreement that you would have to pay for half of the renovations when you bought the house. So you don\u2019t have to pay anything for renovating it or you still have half of the house if your name is on the deed. He can pressure you all he wants but if he wanted that to be the deal he should\u2019ve said so before you purchase the house.\nAnd second if you are going to end up paying for half of the renovations why does that mean that you have to pay him can\u2019t you pay anyone you want to as long as you pay for half of it hire a professional team that way at least it will get done quicker you don\u2019t have to hire him. He insist that you agreed to do all the renovations yourselves then say fine but we never agreed I would have to pay you for the work . so either he can do the renovations mostly himself and not get paid or you can pay a professional team to do the renovations that you\u2019re going to pay for.", "At what emotional, physical and financial cost though?", "Bullies never admit they're unreasonable. He refused counseling, why do you expect him to discuss this?", "You need therapy. Your husband sounds like an AH, you sound traumatized.", "You're creating a different kind of horror story with a controlling and abusive husband though. This is abusive behavior.", "Only it wouldn't. He took care of that by making you part of this project, and now asking every penny of you, and making it impossible for you to back out...", "My husband and I have separate finances but we would never charge one another for something like this, and if one person wants something the other doesn\u2019t agree with they take on more financial burden. He\u2019s being an AH by bankrupting you for his own pet project.", "In these separate finances, do you do 50/50 or do you do proportionately by income? Because if you aren't doing the latter, renegotiate. But also, go to therapy, by yourself, whatever. And start making an exit plan.", "[removed]", "You're putting time, energy and money into something you have no interest in, has gone on for years and there's no end in sight.\n\nThose who like to renovate like to do it so he might want to buy another house with the proceeds from this one.", "How about selling him your interest in the house? That way he gets full ownership and rights to profits, you back what you\u2019ve put in to date plus any interest/equity. He gets to keep working on his fun toy, you get a pile of money, and you get tf out of this nightmare reno.", "Maybe, you could suggest some financial planning counseling as a start?\n\nYou both clearly have different expectations and. if you could remove this source of tension, it might lead him to consider how to resolve other issues.\n\nBest wishes", "Naomi, he's managed to get you to pay him to work on a house that only he wanted. If I had to rate his manipulation skills on a scale from 1/10, I'd give him a 10/10 just for this alone. Manipulators don't have to be super charming people that convince you that everything they want is a great idea. Many of the best manipulators out there simply play the victim and start arguments every time they don't get their way. He's gotten you to buy a house you didn't want, and now you're paying him to work on the house you don't want. He's genuinely a GREAT manipulator.", "Google search and research the options of how to split financial responsibility and go back to him and have another conversation. This system isn\u2019t working for you and you need to find something better as a couple.", "If you're working the reno, he pays *you*.  \n\n\nBecause you hate doing it, your rate is 15% higher than his hourly rate.  \n\n\nWhen you work on Saturdays, you get paid double time.", "That\u2019s not a compromise.  That\u2019s pandering to him.  His idea of being paid by his spouse is stupid.\n\nAs someone who ruined themselves financially over a house and has yet to fully recover after almost 20 years, take the loss and get out of this situation.

Just flat out refuse.", "But he has only done the work because he refuses to hire professionals to do it.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a \u201cwe could only afford the home but no the remodel\u201d situation.\n\nHe chose to be cheap and do things the hard way and is now mad at the inequity. Did she ever say she is an expert home building and eager to do all this work?", "Right? Well, if he wants to charge his wife then two can play at that game. I'm half kidding, have a convo with him that he decided to do the DYI himself and can change his mind. at any point and hire. a pro.", "JFC do not live in that house if he does the wiring.", "Honestly I would think if I wanted to be with someone who has this attitude \nAnd if you didn\u2019t do it he would have to pay someone \n\nYou could hire yourself to other families and make more money and he would have to pay someone to do what you did", "Considering it sounds like the work he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t professional level, then when you go to sell the buyers will be asking for the price to be lowered because they will have to pay to have professionals redo things he did poorly that they look the way they should\u2014like the chipped windows that also have other problems.", "If you stop cleaning the house u live in Eventually there will be mold there will be insects, vermin,  and the house will deteriorate very quickly which will cause major decrease in the value of the home. Your daily cleaning of the home Directly prevents this deterioration from happening and has significant value.", "It's a messy situation for sure. He is still the asshole for forcing you into this position. TBH, since the wealth disparity is so large then the split finances is always going to be a problem... if you are splitting everything 50/50 then either you will be forced to live above your means or the husband will be forced to live below his means. The other alternative, which many couples do, is contribute proportionally or contribute up to a max amount.  \n\nBut it sounds like in this case, you were pressured into living above your means and it's put you in this difficult position. \n\nLooking at it from a purely business perspective, if you were hiring contractors to do the house, then you would each owe a half their rate. But he is doing it instead, saving both of you from that expense. It's not fair that he gets the full benefit of saving on labor and getting paid for labor... since he should also owe half of the labor, in other words he is responsible for half of his own labor cost. Essentially, he is working his half off and you are paying your half off, so you would really only owe him half of whatever rate he is trying to charge. From a business perspective, a buyout would make the most sense here... you would still get your investment back and a little more, and not be obligated to supply any material or labor. He would own the house but that doesn't mean you couldn't still live there. \n\nBut this is not just a business, it's a relationship, and you are planning to make a house together to live in. From a relationship perspective, both partners are obligated to contribute to the relationship emotionally and financially. The financial aspect might be a combination of working a job, doing housework, child rearing, etc. You are contributing through your job, he is choosing to contribute by working on the house. I think this is the way most people see it (including myself) and is why you shouldn't be obligated to pay him for his labor. That would be like you demanding he pay you hourly for any housework you do. \n\nBut you need to stand up for yourself and figure out a way to untangle this mess. From a relationship perspective, the only consequence of not helping with the renovation should be that it will take longer, just like the consequence of not doing the dishes is that you have dirty dishes...there is no financial penalty.", "Girl\u2026 four years in nothing in the scheme of life when you\u2019re like to be caught in this situation indefinitely.

But maybe this aspect of our lives is not quite okay...", "remember he can insist and pressure you all he wants but you can still say no, don\u2019t be afraid to say no.
