I visited the doctor about it and she confirmed that this was chronic and therefore gave me a handicapped sticker. She gave me the choice of getting a cane or something akin to it but I unfortunately don\u2019t have the money to cover it and my insurance sucks. So it\u2019s not very obvious that I\u2019m disabled. \nNow to start off context is needed. I was skipping school (it\u2019s my senior year and we weren\u2019t going to do anything all day) and I decided that going to target would be fun. So I drove there and parked in a handicapped spot. I was in target for maybe 40 minutes to an hour before I got bored and checked out. I was walking out to my car with a very clear limp in my step when I noticed a lady standing right by it. She had to have been in her 40\u2019s. \nI walk up to her and ask if she\u2019s okay and she goes \u201cno I\u2019m not okay actually, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you getting out of your car earlier. You seem a bit young to be in a handicapped spot.\u201d I was curious as to why she stood there for an hour just to confront me, but regardless she was fairly nice about it so despite by discomfort I explained to her that I have an invisible disability and it\u2019s hard for me to walk.\nShe ended up getting into my face and saying \u201cso why don\u2019t you have a cane? Of a wheelchair?? Just admit that you\u2019re a fucking liar!!!\u201d \nI. Was. Flabbergasted. \nAt this point I\u2019m done with this lady\u2019s bullshit so I look at her and tell her \u201caren\u2019t you a bit too saggy to be in a 17 year olds face like this? Back the fuck up and get a life bitch\u201d She didn\u2019t take kindly to me calling her saggy and so she yelled at me about how other people need it more than I do (at this point I was struggling to stand, how ironic). So I just get into my car and drive off.\n\nI do feel kind of bad for calling her saggy and a bitch (even if she was) and I do know that there are more people that are more disabled than me.

It took me a long time to stop caring about what strangers think but it's difficult when people aren't happy and try to make others as unhappy as they are", "Aww sorry to hear that! I hope you\u2019re able to find an affordable one soon! I use a knee scooter myself", "She deserved it\u2026 cmon now.", "I\u2019m sorry for calling you dumb I didn\u2019t even expect you to reply. But I just can\u2019t fathom how you would possibly think you are in the wrong here. That lady is an asshole, very much so. Like it\u2019s very obvious.", "I have rlly bad anxiety so I always think the worst possible thing in every situation. I accept your apology even if I\u2019m still mildly annoyed at being called dumb.", "I mean maybe you could of not called her saggy although I\u2019m not even sure what that meant. Like saggy boobs? Or saggy stomach? Lol. Yea idk I kind of just wrote the first thing that came to my mind but that was an asshole move on my part so Im glad u accept it. But yea ur def not the asshole."]}
