I visited the doctor about it and she confirmed that this was chronic and therefore gave me a handicapped sticker. She gave me the choice of getting a cane or something akin to it but I unfortunately don\u2019t have the money to cover it and my insurance sucks. So it\u2019s not very obvious that I\u2019m disabled. \nNow to start off context is needed. I was skipping school (it\u2019s my senior year and we weren\u2019t going to do anything all day) and I decided that going to target would be fun. So I drove there and parked in a handicapped spot. I was in target for maybe 40 minutes to an hour before I got bored and checked out. I was walking out to my car with a very clear limp in my step when I noticed a lady standing right by it. She had to have been in her 40\u2019s. \nI walk up to her and ask if she\u2019s okay and she goes \u201cno I\u2019m not okay actually, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you getting out of your car earlier. You seem a bit young to be in a handicapped spot.\u201d I was curious as to why she stood there for an hour just to confront me, but regardless she was fairly nice about it so despite by discomfort I explained to her that I have an invisible disability and it\u2019s hard for me to walk.\nShe ended up getting into my face and saying \u201cso why don\u2019t you have a cane? Of a wheelchair?? Just admit that you\u2019re a fucking liar!!!\u201d \nI. Was. Flabbergasted. \nAt this point I\u2019m done with this lady\u2019s bullshit so I look at her and tell her \u201caren\u2019t you a bit too saggy to be in a 17 year olds face like this? Back the fuck up and get a life bitch\u201d She didn\u2019t take kindly to me calling her saggy and so she yelled at me about how other people need it more than I do (at this point I was struggling to stand, how ironic). So I just get into my car and drive off.\n\nI do feel kind of bad for calling her saggy and a bitch (even if she was) and I do know that there are more people that are more disabled than me. Am I the asshole, Reddit?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m much too tall for a cane that stores sell and I don\u2019t have a card, I\u2019m living on cash lol.

They only work for people within a very limited height range, don't work if someone has certain hand differences or hand pain, and they also are not very sturdy. They break easily just from regular wear and tear. So if someone is too tall, too short, has any differences in their hand, has any hand pain, and doesn't have the money to replace them regularly, those canes are not a solution. I only say this because I know a lot of people who use canes and need special ones and they also get people telling them \"but they're so cheap at the pharmacy!\" and it tires them out to explain it all the time. So I try to explain it whenever I see someone say canes are really cheap. \n\nGenerally, if someone were able to get one of those canes, they would. I'd always assume that a disabled person has done their research, because too many people assume that we haven't even tried looking at the most basic solutions. People who assume we haven't considered basic solutions aren't being cruel, and generally only have the intention of being helpful, but they just don't realize that it's kind of akin to a microaggression, because it's yet another implication that the disabled person just isn't doing everything they could do. And that's what the medical system and society tells disabled people constantly. All the things like that, big and small, add up. \n\nI use a rollator myself, and I'm lucky my insurance covered it because it would've been hundreds of dollars otherwise for the kind I need. But when I was trying to get it I kept being told I could get one for super cheap! I couldn't use those kinds. I also need a wheelchair for certain things and I can't afford the kind I need, which means I just can't do those things until I get one, and insurance doesn't cover them even though I got a prescription. Of course I've thoroughly researched all my options, but that doesn't stop people from telling me that I could get a heavy, easily broken, manual wheelchair for really cheap from Walmart, as though I wouldn't get a cheap wheelchair if I could use that kind. In general, I think it's best to avoid giving unsolicited advice to a disabled person about their disability, especially if the advice assumes that they are unaware of the easiest, most well known solution for their problem.\n\nDoes all of that make sense? Genuinely not trying to come across as passive aggressive or angry or anything. Just wanted to share how many disabled people feel about this kind of input and explain the reasoning behind it. I understand you may be disabled too, but \"any single point cane will do\" is just not the case for many, many people, and it's frustrating to hear over and over for people who have been desperately trying to find a solution for their unique needs.", "Totally agree, though it's not akin to a microagression, it IS a microagression.", "It took me all of my 20s to get past it too. But this Christmas my friend is getting me a walker with a seat \ud83e\udd23 also finally going to ask my doctor to start the paperwork for my disability placard. I\u2019m very proud of 32 year old me.", "I think it can be, and I definitely feel that way about it, but I also know *some* disabled people who aren't bothered by it at all, so I hesitate to universally declare that it's a microaggression just because it feels that way to me. I know I personally really dislike unsolicited advice and that not everyone minds it. I try to be cautious with my language so that my personal bias doesn't lead me to overstate the severity of the behavior. I don't feel like I can speak for everyone on this one topic, but yeah, to me it is a microaggression. I know I'm not alone in feeling that way, obviously, but I also don't want anyone to dismiss what I'm saying because *they* don't consider it to be a microaggression.\n\nThere also are, of course, rare occasions where a disabled person has *not* heard of a well-known, basic thing that could help them, and I understand people wanting to make sure that some helpful thing has not been missed. I've definitely felt that way before, especially because I know plenty of disabled people are too exhausted to research all the options for all of their needs. I personally feel like the solution to this is to first say, \"You may already know all about this, so feel free to ignore, but just in case you haven't come across this, here is some info about xyz.\" It acknowledges the disabled person's expertise about their own body and needs, while also offering information that might be helpful, without making any assumptions or demands. What bothers me is when people make really basic suggestions with no disclaimer, especially if they claim that something someone is struggling with is really easy and/or cheap to solve.\n\nLike obviously it's a microaggression to suggest someone \"just try yoga,\" \"get less screen time,\" \"try lavender,\" or other bingo card type things that every chronically ill person has been told 10,000 times, but I'm not sure if every ignorant suggestion regarding disability is a microaggression? I think some might be borderline microaggressions, or microaggression-adjacent lol. And maybe that's determined on an individual basis? I genuinely am not sure how to think about it.", "You\u2019re welcome :)"]}
