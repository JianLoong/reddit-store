He had 120 days to cash me out on my half of the equity in our home. In exchange, I was to provide him a quitclaim deed for my interest in the home. We went to the bank today to have the doc witnessed and notarized. I told him I would not give him the doc without proof of wire transfer, either completed or initiated. He gave me a confirmation that an email was sent. In the confirmation, it stated they would reply in 1-2 days. I told him to let me know when they did and he could have a copy of the doc. He completely flew off the handle and started yelling at me that I was in contempt of court. I leave to go out of town for the holidays in 2 days and let him know that I would drop his copy at my attorneys office and he could pick it up there if he is able to provide proof of completed/initiated transfer.\nWe are divorced because he cheated and lied about several things. During our entire separation and all through our divorce I have followed through with everything I said I would. I have even helped him with a ton of stuff that I didn\u2019t need to because I did it for us for 20 years as a married couple. Now all of a sudden he thinks I am not going to do what I say I am. Giving him this document means I received the money. It also says so in the document.

Give it to your lawyer and he will confirm compliance with the other attorney and it's done and done.  He's the one with trust issues (and reasons for YOU to have as opposed to him thinking you might stoop to his level), so that is fair, and all parties will get what was agreed upon so long as they live up to their end of the bargain (ie he actually transferred the money)", "NTA  \n\n\nHe is being a big baby. An email asking for the wire transfer does not equal money in the bank. Stick to your guns, you've got a solid plan in place already. If he can lie and cheat, he can certainly find a way to try and snake his way out of this payout.", "NTA. Once he has that quitclaim deed he is home free and you are out of luck. If anyone is in violation of a court order, it is him. He hasn\u2019t completed the funds transfer. Wait until the money is in your account.", "NTA. \n\nThe agreement was the quitclaim deed for your interest in the home. You do not have that money. He has seen your end of the deal completed but you are still waiting for his to go through. \n\nShit can happen between this and the actual receipt of money. He can wait.", "NTA\n\nSounds sketch.  \n\nWait for a COMPLETED transaction only.  Initiated can be stopped.  \n\nLet your attorney handle this.", "NTA.  He thinks you're lying because he'd lie.\n\nDo not give him the document until you confirm that you *received* the money - not just that he sent it, but that it's actually in your account.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA  but can your attorney handle this? His response was inappropriate, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with him either.", "He's trying to cheat you out of your money is my guess. Forward your lawyer any correspondence he sends on this topic, and don't speak with him about it over the phone or otherwise.  Email or text only. NTA.", "Not a lawyer, haven\u2019t been divorced or anything, but have seen smaller things like this go down. \n\nDo not give home anything til the money is in your account. I would even go so far to pull it and put it in a separate account so he can\u2019t attempt to pull it after. \n\nWhat happens if he \u201cinitiates\u201d the transfer. You give him the document that says you\u2019re good and he cancels the transfer? Now he has a notarized document from you saying you\u2019ve received the funds. The burden is now on you to prove you didn\u2019t get them or move them to another account. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The quitclaim should not be completed until the money is in your account. I would never budge on that. Him flying off the handle changes nothing and probably helps cement your reasons for leaving such an unreasonable AH.", "NTA - proof that the wire has been initiated is not enough.  You absolutely need a formal confirmation that the funds have been received and settled on your end. There is no way you are in contempt of court over this.  \n\nThe only reason I can see for him getting so angry and threatening you is that he hasn\u2019t in fact made the transfer and is hoping to trick you into giving up your rights.", "NTA.

Keep up with what you're doing.", "The only person that can say you are in contempt of court is a judge. NTA.", "NTA.  No money.  No deed.  He may have thought he could get the deed and then withhold the money.  Good for you for holding his feet to the fire.", "NTA.  An email is not proof of a monitory or other transaction.  Anyone can write an email with anything in the world written on it.", "NTA. No money, no document. Once that cash hits your account, then you can call your lawyer's office to release the document.\n\nThis is the only leverage you have to get the money owed you. Don't hand it over just because your lying, cheating ex yelled. His yelling is not your problem any more.", "NTA. Tell him due to the way he is speaking to you, your attorney said it is best if you let him handle it so no matter what, you will be giving it to the attorney. And that any future contact must go through the attorney otherwise you will get a restraining order.", "Give it to your attorney and make him submit proof. I would stop talking to him altogether after this. He\u2019s obviously trying to avoid paying you by getting the document to claim he already has.", "NTA.  You\u2019re not in contempt unless you refuse to give him the document *after* you\u2019ve received the money.  That means the money is in your account.  Not a confirmation that it\u2019s been initiated.  Proof that it has been completed.  With mobile banking, you should be able to see that the money has been deposited to your account, even if you\u2019re not in town. \n\nI\u2019d recommend transferring the money immediately into a savings or other account.  Then, and only then, should you give your attorney instructions to release the document.  \n\nYou\u2019ve signed a document stating you\u2019ve received funds in return for your quitclaim.  Do not give him the document based solely on proof of initiation of transfer as there is a possibility of that transfer being cancelled.  Once he has the document, it\u2019ll be that much harder to get your funds if he cancels the transaction or never really initiated it in the first place.  \n\nNo court is going to hold you in contempt of a court order that stipulates payment as a condition of receiving the quitclaim until payment is completed and you actually refuse to provide the document.", "NTA - FYI Wires are pretty much instant....

Then if he tries to argue that you \u201cunreasonably\u201d withheld the document, you have proof that you lawyer was the intermediary with instructions to release it as soon as the conditions were met.", "NTA definitely wait until you get your money.", "You are doing the correct thing. Let him communicate via the attorney", "Cash 1st then the receipt !", "NTA", "NTA.", "Wire transfers (as opposed to ACH or some other form of transfer) should happen basically instantly, so if the money\u2019s not already in your account, it was either not sent via wire or not sent at all.", "NTA\n\nHe has proven himself to be an untrustworthy liar.", "NTA. Your ex is playing the victim & trying to bully you into doing something that is unwise and potentially very damaging to your financial interests. From this incident & your description of the reasons for your divorce, it sounds like the man is a walking red flag. Whatever you do, DON\u2019T do what he\u2019s telling you to do.\n\nAbsolutely nobody who is playing things straight would (1) try to pass off an email as a substitute for a wire transfer confirmation, (2) pitch a fit when they don\u2019t get the quit-claim document without holding up their end of the agreement first, and (3) throw around phrases like \u201ccontempt of court\u201d to intimidate you. As another commenter said, only the judge can find you in contempt. With the way he\u2019s acting, I\u2019d bet the very last thing this man wants is the judge looking over his shoulder. If he threatens you with contempt, tell him to take it to the judge. He won\u2019t because he can\u2019t. He\u2019s just hoping you don\u2019t know that.\n\nAgree with others who\u2019ve recommended you ask the attorneys to complete the transaction and cut off contact with your ex except communication through attorneys. The fact that you\u2019re here asking about this & feeling defensive about your own history of trustworthiness says a lot about how much manipulation you\u2019ve dealt with from the ex. He\u2019s still doing it, you\u2019re not yet 100% confident that it\u2019s manipulation vs truth, and those are two very good reasons to put an attorney between you as an intermediary. Let him pull this BS with your attorney and go live your life in peace and happiness.", "DO NOT GIVE HIM ANY DOCUMENTATION!!!!  \nObviously, he's not a man to be trusted. Do not for one second consider giving him the deed before you have the money safely deposited in your account.   \nHe can rant all he wants, do not let him push you around.   \nSafest route, as you said, give it to your lawyer so he can't continue to badger you for it. No money, no deed. You don't answer to him!  \nHis part of the agreement has to be completed before you can act on yours.", "Don't give him the doc until:\n\n(1) you receive the money. Not that the transaction has been initiated, but that it has been completed.\n(2) you transfer it, in some irreversible way, to a different account. You do not want the transaction able to be reversed and from the sounds of it, he is not to be trusted.", "Question though wont the quitclaim be invalid since he failed to complete this part of the deal?", "I don't understand why she signed it before receiving the money. That makes no sense. Why would you sign you got the money before you got it?", "Most likely it will still be valid unless she goes to court to try to enforce the agreement.", "It would be, but if she gives him a document stating she\u2019s received the funds before the funds hit her account, and then he cancels the transaction, she would now have to spend a bunch of money taking him to court to prove he violated the court order.  Puts the burden on her.  Better to withhold the document until all the terms of the agreement have been met.", "Probably because it was easier for her to get it notarized when she had the time, instead of waiting on her deadbeat ex while getting ready for holiday trips. It's effectively just a piece of paper until she delivers it to the ex.", ">I don't understand why she signed it before receiving the money. That makes no sense. Why would you sign you got the money before you got it?\n\nSame this makes no sense", "That\u2019s not that uncommon.  Getting a document notarized can be a PITA.  You do it when it\u2019s convenient.  I had an insurance settlement from a car crash and the insurance company wanted me to send in the signed document prior to sending the settlement check.  It stated I had received the money.  My attorney told them we\u2019d provide the document after we received the check.  I signed the document, gave it to my attorney and he handled the exchange.", "ah thank you :)"]}
