He had 120 days to cash me out on my half of the equity in our home. In exchange, I was to provide him a quitclaim deed for my interest in the home. We went to the bank today to have the doc witnessed and notarized. I told him I would not give him the doc without proof of wire transfer, either completed or initiated. He gave me a confirmation that an email was sent. In the confirmation, it stated they would reply in 1-2 days. I told him to let me know when they did and he could have a copy of the doc. He completely flew off the handle and started yelling at me that I was in contempt of court. I leave to go out of town for the holidays in 2 days and let him know that I would drop his copy at my attorneys office and he could pick it up there if he is able to provide proof of completed/initiated transfer.\nWe are divorced because he cheated and lied about several things. During our entire separation and all through our divorce I have followed through with everything I said I would. I have even helped him with a ton of stuff that I didn\u2019t need to because I did it for us for 20 years as a married couple. Now all of a sudden he thinks I am not going to do what I say I am. Giving him this document means I received the money. It also says so in the document. Am I being unreasonable or an a-hole or is he just being a big baby because he\u2019s not getting his way?", "created_utc": 1703090076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18myrek/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_ex_a_doc/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give it to your lawyer and he will confirm compliance with the other attorney and it's done and done.  He's the one with trust issues (and reasons for YOU to have as opposed to him thinking you might stoop to his level), so that is fair, and all parties will get what was agreed upon so long as they live up to their end of the bargain (ie he actually transferred the money)", "NTA  \n\n\nHe is being a big baby. An email asking for the wire transfer does not equal money in the bank. Stick to your guns, you've got a solid plan in place already. If he can lie and cheat, he can certainly find a way to try and snake his way out of this payout.", "NTA. Once he has that quitclaim deed he is home free and you are out of luck. If anyone is in violation of a court order, it is him. He hasn\u2019t completed the funds transfer. Wait until the money is in your account.", "NTA. \n\nThe agreement was the quitclaim deed for your interest in the home. You do not have that money. He has seen your end of the deal completed but you are still waiting for his to go through. \n\nShit can happen between this and the actual receipt of money. He can wait.", "NTA\n\nSounds sketch.  \n\nWait for a COMPLETED transaction only.  Initiated can be stopped.  \n\nLet your attorney handle this.", "NTA.  He thinks you're lying because he'd lie.\n\nDo not give him the document until you confirm that you *received* the money - not just that he sent it, but that it's actually in your account.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA  but can your attorney handle this? His response was inappropriate, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with him either.", "He's trying to cheat you out of your money is my guess. Forward your lawyer any correspondence he sends on this topic, and don't speak with him about it over the phone or otherwise.  Email or text only. NTA.", "Not a lawyer, haven\u2019t been divorced or anything, but have seen smaller things like this go down. \n\nDo not give home anything til the money is in your account. I would even go so far to pull it and put it in a separate account so he can\u2019t attempt to pull it after. \n\nWhat happens if he \u201cinitiates\u201d the transfer. You give him the document that says you\u2019re good and he cancels the transfer? Now he has a notarized document from you saying you\u2019ve received the funds. The burden is now on you to prove you didn\u2019t get them or move them to another account. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The quitclaim should not be completed until the money is in your account. I would never budge on that. Him flying off the handle changes nothing and probably helps cement your reasons for leaving such an unreasonable AH.", "NTA - proof that the wire has been initiated is not enough.  You absolutely need a formal confirmation that the funds have been received and settled on your end. There is no way you are in contempt of court over this.  \n\nThe only reason I can see for him getting so angry and threatening you is that he hasn\u2019t in fact made the transfer and is hoping to trick you into giving up your rights.", "NTA.  Sounds like he's trying to pull a fast one on you.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
