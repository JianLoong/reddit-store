{"id": 32193, "submission_id": "1896708", "title": "WIBTA for asking my family to accommodate food allergies for our annual Christmas baking day?", "selftext": "Every year my wife\u2019s family hosts Christmas Baking day. Everyone gets together with the grandkids too and the grandkids sometimes help. Well, my wife and I have a child who is allergic to peanuts and eggs. They are 2 and at the age where they are beginning to notice that others get food he can\u2019t have. Which is fine and it\u2019s part of life, but with this Christmas Baking day he won\u2019t be able to have ANY items due to cross contamination. He also won\u2019t be able to help at all due to cross contamination. As a parent this is obviously problematic. \n\nSo, WIBTA if we asked the family to use peanut free chocolate and other ingredients that are peanut free? In addition, they do have egg replacer you can use instead of actual eggs. We were considering asking them about that too, or if they would consider making the treats that use egg a separate day. \n\nFyi there are like 5 different types of treats they make - fudge, cookies, truffles, chocolate covered pretzels, etc. I think only the cookies use egg. Also there will be other activities for the kids to do - IE going to the park nearby or playing with the other cousins and toys. The other cousins will all help with baking in some capacity, especially as they get older. Also, things fall on the floor, kids may not wash their hands, etc.\n\nLast year worked out okay because our kid was 1 and had no idea what was going on. \n\nAnyone have any advice on how to approach this topic? Baking these treats is a long standing tradition with the family, so some of these requests may seem wild to them. My wife and I can\u2019t tell if we would be out of line asking for some changes for our own peace of mind and for our child to be included in the fun (and enjoyment of the treats) going forward.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback. We are going to move forward with asking that they do the cookies last after we leave or perhaps we will stay away from the area when they are making food with eggs. We\u2019ve suggested peanut free alternatives for everything else, and as you all said we think that should be easier to accommodate than the eggs. \n\nIn my own mind, including others trumps traditions, but I also know that egg replacer objectively probably tastes worse than actual eggs. So hopefully they can do the egg treats last after we leave. \n\nDouble edit: In response to people saying just don\u2019t go, that is not an ideal choice for a couple reasons. First, it\u2019s kind of expected that we\u2019d be there and I think there would be a lot of drama if we did not go. It\u2019s honestly like Christmas part 1. Second, I think based on the feedback in this thread, it\u2019s reasonable to ask for peanut free options and save the egg foods for last. Third, there are only so many Christmases left with grandma and grandpa, you know? However, we will not attend if there are gonna be eggs and peanut products everywhere.

By the very nature of fudge, etc, one would keep those items away from raw eggs to begin.\n\nCould you just ask that the cookies be prepared before you arrive or after you leave?  Or in another area of the kitchen?  Depending on the cookie, substituting the egg for an egg replacement might not be a viable option.", "Uhhh\u2026 I appreciate the feedback people gave you but also\u2026 there are SO many egg and peanut free recipes you and your extended family could try. Shortbread is (imho) much tastier AND much more christmassy than cookies and guess what. No eggs. No peanuts. Just plain flour, caster sugar and butter. Traditional Austrian Vanillekipferl (yum) don\u2019t have any of those either. Like\u2026 These are top tier Christmas biscuits. I feel like something *could* give here without compromising taste to make the whole experience more inclusive.", " NTA for asking but I would suggest also offering to provide the substitute ingredients that way it actually saves them money instead of costing money (and don\u2019t get the cheap ones get the good ones)", "NTA for asking. Be ready if they say no, which not knowing the family dynamic I can't say which one they'd lean to. \n\nYou could also suggest doing 1-2 items first that your kid can participate in. At 2 years old, they likely aren't hanging and participating for more baking than that anyway. Then go to the park or the other activities you mentioned so the eggs and peanuts can come out.", "It\u2019s a pretty big request, but for the goodies you mentioned peanut free substitutions would be pretty simple. And just don\u2019t let your kid have the cookies with eggs.", "This is one of those things where there\u2019s no way to make it fair or even or just. No one is wrong, no one did anything wrong, but it is still hurtful. \n\nI\u2019ve been a parent for 20 years and have 6 kids. For US, I call this a \u2018path of least resistance\u2019 situation. I know I\u2019m not technically using that phrase correctly but I give names to concepts when I\u2019m teaching my kids stuff. \n\nWhat is the decision that causes the least upset/inconvenience/whatever to the most people? \n\nFor this, it would be a 3 step process for me. \n\nStep 1: Decision. Removing my child would be the correct decision this year. It causes the least upheaval and fosters good will. \n\nStep 2: Replace that activity. Figure out something that you can do with the kiddo to replace this activity. Maybe when the family is doing this, you and the wife take the kid to dinner and a show. Or dessert and shopping for Cmas presents for the grandparents. Or a drive through light show. A sports game, a play, a weekend away- whatever fits in your family life and interests. You\u2019ll do this every year on their cookie night and start a tradition that your child looks forward to. \n\nStep 3: Negate future problems. After Christmas you need to sit down with the in laws and discuss how this is going to be negated in the future. Your child can\u2019t be left out of everything bc of his allergies. The family is going to have to make sacrifices in some way. Your son is worthy of those sacrifices. \n\nYou need to come to an agreement about: \n\n- Family dinners. You can\u2019t control what others do in their own home so everyone needs to be on board with you bringing his own food. EVEN if that means it\u2019s take out that will upset other kids in the family. Life gets busy and you won\u2019t always have the time to prepare an allergy friendly replication of what they\u2019re cooking. You may have to stop and grab take out that he can safely eat on the way. \n\n- You\u2019ll have to curate a list of foods that are safe to order for him from local restaurants. That may mean meeting with a manager at each restaurant and talking to them. You\u2019ll have to make multiple copies of each binder and distribute to each family member. \n\n- Cakes for birthdays. You\u2019ll have to find a bakery that can cater to your sons needs and distribute that info to each family member. They can order the cake from there, order your son his own mini cake, or give you a heads up so you can order it. Who pays for it is up to you guys. You can plan a fun night with the adults and have a taste testing from that bakery so they can see what everything tastes like. Give them a price list so they can factor that in. \n\n- Have a dinner with the adults of the family and bring a medical professional in to show everyone how to properly administer his epipen and what to do after. Call it Eats & Epinephrine or Shots for Shots or whatever. That way everyone knows how to properly react to an accidental exposure. \n\n- Make it clear that you will NOT entertain complaints that the other kids in the family don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d or they got upset bc Juniors food looked better than everyone else\u2019s or Junior got pizza while everyone else had pot roast. \n\n- Be patient. There will be growing pains. There will be mistakes. Everyone will survive everything. Your son also deserves to survive. \n\nI hope that helps you a bit! I always remember to be SO thankful that my own entire offensive line of kids didn\u2019t come with a food or life threatening allergy. We do have Tourette\u2019s, though, and that\u2019s a wild ride if it\u2019s own! ;)", "I think it is totally fine to ask. Honestly if anyone in my family had an allergy like that we would just accommodate them because it is not a big deal. I worked in restaurants for years, I cook and bake all of the time and am very good at it. It is not hard to keep eggs and nuts out of most baking. Egg substitutes are fine for cookies and it is super easy to get peanut free chocolate. You can make egg substitute out of flax seeds and water lol. Or find a way to ensure there isn\u2019t cross contamination. They can make cookies at the dining room table, and you or your wife can be on contaminant clean up duty.  I think offering to get those ingredients would be helpful. People are acting like this is some super huge ask and I just really can\u2019t imagine feeling that way about family. They may say no and that is also okay, although I think it\u2019s a bit small hearted", "YTA - that\u2019s an awful lot to ask - it negates the family preferred treats and tastes and puts a damper on their fun and tradition\n\nMad empathy for your situation though.  \n\nYou do have a teachable moment for your child here, they are going to need to learn to cope with their allergy issue and so you can consider using the family baking opportunity to talk about avoiding things and why, what they can eat instead, you can bring a treat for the 2 year old to make that falls within their ability and tolerance.  \u2026.Dip grapes in powdered sugar and pop in freezer.  Melt some safe chocolate in a little pan and let them dip sliced apples, etc\u2026so they are both safely participating and learning \u2026\n\nMaybe Teach them some kids can\u2019t eat shrimp, some can\u2019t eat nuts, some can\u2019t drink milk \u2026etc\u2026and that it\u2019s just part of life and how their body works. \n\nWe have this issue in our family.  2 grandkids of 8 that have nut and seafood allergy issues.  Epipen level allergy.  We all support them and the problem but do so in a way that doesn\u2019t penalize everyone.  \n\nAt all family events, the food is labeled clearly if it has a known allergen.  The parents go around with the kids and cover the potential problem foods.  There are plenty of options for the grandkids with allergies.  Many in family will make a small version of a dish without nuts for them to try if so inclined.  \n\n Also, on the dessert buffet there are always tree nut free cupcakes for them - just in case. \n\nSo Perhaps consider making this family event a teachable moment for your child about what makes them itchy, rashy, trouble breathing \u2026to scary anaphylaxis- epipen and emergency trip.  \n\nThe sooner they learn, and receive re-enforcement - the safer and safer they will become for pre k, kindergarten, school etc\u2026\n\nKnow you just want them to participate and not feel slighted and applaud that and also know they have a scary potentially life threatening issue - so educate and model !!! \n\nBest of Luck \ud83c\udf40", "NAH - however, finding a substitute for the eggs is a problem. One doesn\u2019t put eggs in cookies for the taste, but for the chemical properties that eggs provide. Baking is cooking science- and eggs are a big part of how it works. They can\u2019t be swapped out for something else in Aunt Patty\u2019s favorite cookies. Look for vegan recipes for baked goods.", "In going to say peanuts, yes. Eggs, no. Many things that you bake NEED eggs to turn out a certain way. Heck, most baked goods, I like mostly because of the eggs. Peanuts are something I think are superfluous to baked goods. \n\nThat being said, I make baked goods with nuts as someone allergic all the time. I make the first part sans nuts and then add them at end for the last batches. Just keep them separate. I don\u2019t have to and don\u2019t always do it. But if someone requests it, I usually do bc why not? I\u2019m not that allergic. \n\nAlso, your kid is two and you still control what he eats. This isn\u2019t a big issue yet. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re thinking forward, but I don\u2019t think this will be as big an issue as you think it is. \n\nAnd talk to your doctor about the newer treatments they have for treating kid\u2019s allergies. Apparently, allergies that start as a child are treatable as opposed to adult onset allergies. Sigh. I miss almonds.", "YTA. As someone who has food allergies, I understand the need to ask. You can\u2019t ask them to replace everything that they bake without nuts and eggs. However, fudge can be made without peanuts. I make fudge all the time for family and friends, and I never use the same pot if I making, something that has peanuts and something that doesn\u2019t. So you could ask them to do one or two variations so your son could participate with. Those are two very specific allergies that you are not going be able to ask people to always accommodate.", "I just buy a steady supply of Enjoy Life Foods chocolate (free of several top food allergens) and give it to any family members that like to bake. It's expensive but worth it IMO. Chocolate is easy to replace with safe chocolate. Eggs are harder since, as you point out in your update, things may not taste as good. If I were in your position, I would get the recipe from your family for the cookies that contain egg, and pre-test it with one or two egg substitutes, to make sure it works. But even so, others may not find it as tasty as the version that contains egg, and then you have to accept that, as long as they're willing to make that recipe last, so your child can participate in the other recipes.\n\nYour child will have to go out into the wide world and learn how to manage eventually. But within the family environment, I think it's reasonable to expect that they be included where possible. However it really depends on how organized the other cooks are. Some people are chaotic in their kitchen and their process just can't be made safe for allergens. You need to be present to supervise also, as things might occur to you, that won't occur to other family members. For example, my MIL is a very tidy cook, but sometimes eats chocolates while she's doing her Christmas baking, and those chocolates might contain nuts. So I had to point out, explicitly, that the nut remnants on her hands from eating her hazelnut candy, could contaminate the cookies she's making. \n\nYour family are entitled not to make any modifications and if they are unwilling (or unable) to make the event safe for your child) then you have to let it go and just skip the event. If you decide to skip the event, you'll probably have to hide from your child that the event occurs, otherwise he'll feel very rejected and excluded. This means most likely none of your children can attend, allergic or non-allergic. \n\nIt would not be a terrible idea to create a similar event just for your own children at your home, that serves as a substitute for your in-laws event, and that is done in an allergen-safe way. This could then be a tradition your kids keep with you when they are adults and when they have their own children.", "NTA for wanting to protect your child. You should either bring treats child can have or not go. It\u2019s a huge request to ask people to change family recipes that have been used for generations.", "NAH Reasonable accommodations to ask for. It's a family baking day. Most people aren't gonna have a problem making simple changes to avoid excluding one of the people the day is for.", "Yta, my 18 month old has a dairy allergy, I take her own food to grandparents , if she wants to cook we will do our own at a small plastic table we have for her out the way, this is obviously a long standing tradition and the world isn't gonna evolve to work around them we need to find ways to include them without inconveniencing vast amounts of people while keeping them safe", "[deleted]", "NTA, but I wouldn't bother asking. If they cared they would have already noticed and be talking to you about accomodations. You are just going to be disappointed.", "absolutely, not an asshole... allergies are a very serious thing.....", "Nah.  He is going to have to get used to it.  Peanuts should be an easy one, but the eggs are kind of a different thing.  Bring a bunch of your own stuff including cookie dough which is egg free (pans too) and then there are fresh cookies for him too.  They have kid books about food allergies which should help with his understanding.", "NTA. Those are easy accommodations for those baked goods.", "Another NTA - Anyone saying this is a \u201cbig ask\u201d is heartless and without understanding how damaging leaving a child out of family activities. No peanuts and using egg substitute is a minor inconvenience, at its most extreme. But I understand, for some people, even a barely registered inconvenience is too much to ask\u2026 even if it is what any decent human would do.", "NTA this is totally reasonable", "I would just say sorry but I cant risk my toddlers health with these ingredients but he and I maybe see you next year but tell your wife to go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would even offer to do a test batch that they can try too with both before the event to make sure it tastes the same", "This! I can\u2019t understand people thinking that asking FAMILY to accomodate dangerous allergy needs would be inconsiderate! Or saying sorry - you\u2019re the only one of all the cousins that can\u2019t come to this event. This is baffling to me. I would bake with allergy friendly substitutions for anyone who was close enough to come to a family event like this. I can\u2019t imagine telling one of the grandkids to just not come.", "Exactly. My best friend\u2019s daughter has epipen level allergies to nuts, eggs, and milk. She has taken this approach since the beginning; her daughter will be around food that she can\u2019t eat her whole life- it\u2019s her responsibility as a parent to 1) make sure she knows what she can and can\u2019t eat and 2) bring her own food and snacks so her daughter can participate as much as possible. \n\nIf you want to protect your child you have to start now- and that means not making their world allergen free, it means being creative and kind but introducing them to the fact that they cannot eat what other people can and that that\u2019s ok.", "Thanks for the feedback. I like all of your suggestions but there is a problem with one of them. I have 0 problem with teaching my child to cope, but the problem is there will be cross contamination of ALL the treats at baking day. It\u2019s the main attraction of the day and the ingredients get everywhere. \n\nUnfortunately there is also an extremely high likelihood of the other grandkids not washing hands and such. For example, one of the cousins had Reese\u2019s puffs as a snack and was dropping them on the floor last year. We\u2019ve since figured out that with that family and they don\u2019t do Reese\u2019s puffs anymore when we\u2019re around. \n\nI\u2019m all for teaching my son to cope, but it\u2019s not realistic at 2 years old on this specific day that is focused only on baking. It\u2019d be like going to a petting zoo but you\u2019re allergic to everything.", "Great suggestion, I don't have food allergies, but most of the time when I make fudge I don't use nuts as a person preference. There's some quick and easy  recipes that a youngster could certainly help with.", "No eggs? That is not at all an easy accommodation for a baking party. The nuts can be worked around.", "No eggs isn\u2019t reasonable. Egg substitute doesn\u2019t taste at all the same. It sucks and I feel really bad for OP and his wife and child but you can\u2019t reasonably expect a baking party to be egg free.", "Maybe less heartless than afraid?\n\nFrom my perspective (no deadly food allergies), the big ask part would be my fear of accidentally causing harm. What if a cousin got out the regular ingredients without being stopped in time? What if the surfaces weren't cleaned enough/right and some cross-contamination occurred, what if I got the wrong safe-substitutes...\n\nI am learning how to be safer since I now know a child who has to be extremely careful about nuts. They can't even have nut-free products that were processed in  certain facilities. We show every food label to their parents in advance to make sure all is well, and wipe down everything before preparing the meal.\n\nThe commenters who suggest the parents bring the special products and do all the non-allergy foods first so the little one tires of it and then goes onto the other activities sounds like a good way to deal with the problem. Given time I would expect the family to feel safer about their competence in keeping all of the children safe.", "Right I just don\u2019t see how this is a huge ask or would put a damper on things for anyone. I can\u2019t imagine  being more attached to real eggs in my cookies than an actual person. My most impressive dessert has raw eggs in it, but I would happily make another or figure out a substitute for anyone with an allergy to be included- even if they weren\u2019t family.", "And I have a solution. I had a dear friend whose son had a nut allergy. I had a big party every year, and never wanted him to miss out on my delicious cookies. So, after I cleaned the kitchen in preparation for baking day- I made the cookies that he could eat  1st, made sure the finished products were stored separately, and then went on with the rest of my baking. No cross contamination.   I suggest you do it that way. When he showed up at the party, I quietly showed him which cookies/ food was \"his\". He never felt singled out or deprived.", "I think that unfortunately means you won't be able to have your child at these events until they're old enough to understand how to care for themselves.

We used 1/8 C peanut butter per egg, but you can also use condensed milk, applesauce, or a couple of other things.\n\nHe was *thrilled*. His mom said that it was the first time that he didn't have to bring his own treat to a birthday party.\n\nThese people are your sons *family*, and it would not only make sense, but it would be the right thing to do for them to make sure he can participate fully.

My brother has a new girlfriend who is celiac so we all just naturally started to accommodate this without being asked, so obviously a young child who is our actual family would be even more important to us to accommodate. If they didn't think of it, I wouldn't think twice about asking. And know they would say yes.\n\nI'm aware other families may not be like this though. They may feel insulted, inconvenienced, etc. in which case your options are to either stay away, or arrive and leave before the allergens are taken out. \n\nYou are never an asshole for asking people a question, especially one that is an important matter to your young child's health.

Bring your own snacks for him", "I have a food allergy (corn) and bring my own food to other people's houses. It is weird to some, but I don't care and don't give it a second thought honestly. I came to see the people and enjoy their company, not feel sick from the food I have no control over. And no one truly understands food allergies unless they have it. \n\nMaybe you can make a batch of his favorite cookies before you go? Put it in a container that is placed away from all the other foods and explain to your son that he can only eat the special ones that mommy and daddy made for him? Then he gets a special cookie treat and doesn't feel left out, plus you all get to see family and have fun too. \n\nFood allergies are not a reason to stay away. That is how it becomes isolating. It's also really hard to control or demand 20 people stop their tradition when they have no allergies. I personally feel that unfair and refuse to have people cater to me - hence why I bring my own stuff or eat beforehand. I believe in alternatives right now until he is old enough to know better. One day he will understand and then you don't have to worry about him feeling left out or eating something he shouldn't. \n\nNAH.", "NTA for asking.

You really can't taste the starch in particular (flax gives a nutty flavor). It's harder to use these as an egg substitute in cakes where you really need a lot of rise.

If I can\u2019t tell my family what I need to feel safe at an event\u2026 who can I have community with?", "\u201cI know we have this big all-day event that\u2019s super fun and all the family is invited but your 2 year old just doesn\u2019t get to participate because he has allergies and we can\u2019t be bothered to make slight changes to include him.\u201d\n\nWhat a bonkers fucking concept. Like aren\u2019t people supposed to make an effort to include their loved ones? Fuck", "Completely agree. I also can\u2019t believe that the other kids don\u2019t already have friends or schoolmates with allergies and aren\u2019t already totally cool with accommodations.  Probably just the adults that are ignorant or inflexible. \nOur adult kid is tree nut allergic and my family still asks every time to make sure they\u2019re not planning any thing problematic when he come over.", "Gently, if it isn\u2019t realistic for your 2 year old to cope (understandably so) do you really think they will feel left out or that they\u2019re missing something?? It sort of sounds like YOU will be upset with them being left out. Totally understandable.\n\nI think you have some responsibility to pack safe things first them to do. Why don\u2019t you bring safe chocolate and pretzels/fruit and make chocolate covered snacks. You can even decorate with sprinkles. \n\nThis is also a learning experience for the other kids in the family to be cognizant of food safety. Maybe you can research a safe sugar cookie recipe and bring items to make that and then decorate. Or be in charge of a craft? \n\nSince your child has the allergies, I\u2019d expect that you\u2019ll need to put in effort to make things accessible for them in order to participate for this particular holiday event. Good luck!!", "Sounds like it\u2019s just this specific, potentially messy event, and probably just until the kid is old enough to understand his own needs. It\u2019s not like folks are being told to never enjoy or share the allergens, just work with them separately from the communal bake.", "You nailed it IMO", "I guess I just come from a family that would rather everyone be together and happy over Christmas than eating a particular cookie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I understand, but I think I you need to be firm. A Christmas baking tradition might not be the best idea anymore. And I don\u2019t understand when you say not going is not an option. Of course it\u2019s an option. If they can\u2019t accommodate - don\u2019t go!", "Parents can ask for a separate baking day.  No, I'm not wasting $100 in baking ingredients  to make cookies no one will eat.  Yes, I spend at least $100 on baking over the holidays.", " made these once and they were amazing. minimalist baker in general is great, and nora cooks, those are my two fav recipe sites for egg and dairy free. \n\n[https://minimalistbaker.com/1-bowl-vegan-sugar-cookies/](https://minimalistbaker.com/1-bowl-vegan-sugar-cookies/)\n\n[https://www.noracooks.com/the-best-vegan-cornbread/](https://www.noracooks.com/the-best-vegan-cornbread/)", "I am away for the weekend but I will when I get home. I also have a great recipe for chocolate cake that is completely dairy/egg free. It is so moist!", "That\u2019s what happens when you ask a bunch of 14 year olds for advice.", "Exactly. I do think there are times when it\u2019s unreasonable to ask for accommodation. For example, when my white sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy free, and whatever else her holistic \u201cdoctor\u201d told her to avoid that week roommate complained to her boss about her coworkers only ever bringing veggies and hummus for her to eat at staff meetings when they always varied up the snacks for everyone else, I thought that was pretty entitled of her. \n\nAsking your own family to not harm your toddler at a family gathering??? Definitely reasonable!!", "How big of an inconvenience it is to avoid allergens really depends on the allergen in question. Cashews are quite easy to avoid on most cuisines; same with most other nuts & peanuts. Other allergens (like eggs) are much more difficult to avoid. \n\nI have multiple allergies. Nuts are really easy to manage and don't incur a food allergy tax when avoiding (minus a few things like sunbutter.) A lot of other allergens aren't.", "Yeah seriously. It would absolutely suck to not be able to be included in this tradition every year simply because you have allergies.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. Start the day with the egg-free and nut-free things and then do the other things. My buddy\u2019s kid has a nut and egg allergy and if I bring any food, I always make sure it\u2019s safe for them.", "And you can eat the raw dough! \n\nCheck out chocolatecoveredkatie.com for some fun things too. And if anyone likes peanut butter cookies, substitute sunflower seed butter instead. When baked, it's the closest I've found. (And you can buy it in food service size tubs)", "Isn\u2019t the fun part making treats? I doubt the kids (or even the adults) are so attached to a specific recipe that they\u2019d put it above the safety and inclusion of a family member. The kids can still have fun making treats, just with slightly different ingredients (which they probably don\u2019t care about at all). All traditions change in small ways over the years. This isn\u2019t completely changing it and the spirit and activities are still preserved.", "So now asking is demanding? This sub is getting ridiculous.", "Do you not know what cross contamination means?", "Oh no, it\u2019s an option. But an avoidable option if people are willing to jump on board! Sorry if I worded that poorly. There is absolutely a world where we don\u2019t go.", "While I agree that eggs in general are tough to avoid, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case in this situation. As an avid baker, eggs are extremely easy to avoid for this occasion. Egg substitutes work great for baking, and there are hundreds of naturally egg free cookie recipes out there. I regularly sub out eggs in my baking simply because I\u2019m out of eggs. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for them to avoid them here.", "I\u2019ve found that the baking powder/water egg replacement works pretty well. I haven\u2019t used it in cookies but banana bread and muffins turn out just about the same as if I used eggs. \n\n\nI can never remember the ratios - I just Google it every time. You could also (more intensive potential solution) ask for recipes especially if it\u2019s only one recipe with egg and test out different egg alternatives on your own to see if they\u2019re any good.", "How are they an AH to ask? It\u2019s not a demand, it\u2019s a request. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to ask family, who love you, to make changes (in this case literally very small ones- peanut free chocolate and no eggs) for your health and inclusion. My family does make accommodations for me with my allergy, because they care about me, want me to be included, and don\u2019t think a hyper-specific recipe is more important than my safety. \n\nThere\u2019s a particular dessert recipe that my grandma makes two of- one with nuts and one without. It\u2019s a semi-significant change but worth it for her. \n\nTraditions can change. It\u2019s probably been modified in dozens of ways over the years already.", "Many people can taste substitutes. There's usually a texture difference as well. Sometimes the texture difference is a good thing (I've had truly amazing vegan zucchini bread because the lack of eggs made it extra moist and just the right density for me). But sometimes it's not. I've had vegan cookies where I definitely noticed the lack of eggs. If asked...I lie and say they're amazing and I can't notice any difference. Because I'm not an a-hole. But I don't go home, throw out my eggs, and start using egg replacers at home.", "Good!", "This is my take! It\u2019s family, being part of family shouldn\u2019t be a place your 2 year old needs to \u201ccope\u201d.", "Yeah, I'm really wondering about some of the families of the redditors who are like \"you cannot change tradition, how dare you even ask\". We have two family members with diverticulitis, so we avoid those foods. My house has food allergies, those are accommodated. Part of holidays is.....family time. I can't understand the rigidity in so many people who think a freaking 2 yr old who still cant have toys with small pieces should just learn and know better. Lordy.", "I envy you this because one side of our family has been awful. Yet our friends made up for it! And my daughter has a stronger relationship with some of our friends than family because of that.\n\nOur friends would absolutely make the Baking Day safe!", "Sorry to hear that! We do have some sticky issues with one side of our family too (this one not allergies, but sensitivity issues with neurodivergent kiddo - they seem to think he just needs \u201cmore discipline\u201d). So frustrating!", "I have a child with a mitochondrial disorder and she has food restrictions and  allergies. \nShe also is severely heat intolerant. I would never think of asking family to modify a FAMILY event bc of her condiition.  \n\nI bring her own food to events. She knows she can't eat off of buffets because of contamination issues and it's just the way it is. We don't inconvenience others because she was dealt a hard hand, but we try to make up for it with her in other ways.\n\nYou can make your own dough and give the baby cookie cutters to \"help\" and then provide the safe food that was pre prepared that you brought from home when it's time to eat.", "genuinely r ur family all sociopaths. like i cannot imagine endangering a child\u2019s life because of \u201cinconvenience\u201d or whatever", "Bit rude to insult my family instead of just realizing that as a mother, there is no feeling of inclusion that is worth risking my daughter's health. I don't know what fingers or ingredients touched what foods and what contaminants could be accidentally present, so we avoid the issue and bring our own food from home because my child's safety is paramount."]}
