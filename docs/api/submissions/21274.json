Honestly, though, this could have been handled better.\n I understand where you and your rules about sleepovers are coming from. But this is a big deal to your daughter. Stop thinking about it as your kid trying to break the rules and think about how you just possibly found out something huge about your daughter, and she didn't even get the chance to tell you.\n\nI would take a deep breath, calm down, and go be the parent your daughter needs. Reassure her that you love her. Ask about the relationship and how it started. Let her know she is safe and celebrated. Then, go over the rules again and be sure that expectations are clear. \n\nI knew that my parents weren't homophobic, but I remember how scared I was to come out.

She knew better, thinking that she could see how far she could take it with locking the door, knowing that she shouldn't but thought she could take her chances.

You should also consider removing the lock, because growing up none of us kids ever had that luxury because as kids we never paid the mortgage, so we had no rights to privacy for anything.  You and your wife need to be her parents first.", "NTA - sounds like she had a scare when you almost barged in on them in an intimate moment.

And there is nothing wrong with your rule objectively.\n\nThat being said, you did mention that they \u201ccuddle together when going to sleep\u201d so they have already slept over before? If this is the case there is some validity to her frustration because the only thing that changed was your realization it was a romantic situation but now they can\u2019t sleep over - maybe she feels like she is being punished for your lack of perception.", "NTA.", "Did you verify with your daughter that she's actually dating this girl?", "NTA very involved father. Thumbs up if you ask me.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your house your rules and it's disrespectful to lock you door at that age if they are fooling around.", "Slight YTA, not for maintaining the rules, but for how you handled the situation in the moment.\n\nYou have to keep in mind a few things. \n\n1) You kicked a teenager out of your house in the middle of the night. That\u2019s dramatic and feels like a punishment. Even if you drove her home, that was a harsh response to a delicate situation. \n2) Your daughter was just outed to you. You are completely accepting which is obviously good, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she was outed. She wasn\u2019t ready to share that with you and it happened suddenly and not at all on her terms. That is a *huge* deal. \n3) The very first thing that happened after she was outed was you guys removing someone she cares about very deeply from your home. \n\nGiven that context and being 15 years old, I don\u2019t think her response was disproportionate to the situation. This whole thing could have been so much smoother if you\u2019d sat both girls down and had an open conversation with them where you could have explained your rules and boundaries and why those are in place.", "Soft YTA. The rule is entirely fair. \n\nBut kicking them out in the middle of the night like that is a bit much. But maybe that\u2019s just me.", "YTA. I get wanting to not have your kids do stuff in the middle of the night, but kicking your daughter\u2019s friend out late at night when you were about to go to bed is extreme. Imagine how awful your daughter\u2019s friend must feel now. That\u2019s the type of stuff that would make her never want to come back to your house, and you\u2019ve either ruined your daughter\u2019s close friendship, or whatever else they may or may not have been doing.\n\nA better solution would have just been to tell them they have to keep the door open, or have a sleepover in your living room or something, as there\u2019s no way they\u2019d do anything then. Then after you could have sat your daughter down and talked to her about things.\n\nAlso, I want to point out, you say your daughter is 15 and you have an older son who you also have the rule of no girlfriends/boyfriends spending the night. That just leads to them doing stuff not in your house where you can\u2019t keep an eye on what is going on.", "YTA not for having rules, but for the way you handled it; as others said, they could have moved to the couch, etc. rather than forcing the friend out late at night. \n\nINFO: Does your daughter have a habit of lying to you? If not, then why believe your son over her? Maybe he just wanted to get her in trouble; he's 12...  Definitely have a talk with your daughter but don't expect it to be easy.", "NTA. I\u2019m 23, have a niece who\u2019s more like a sister who\u2019s 18, and one who\u2019s 12. I\u2019ll tell you that it seems super questionable and almost like you\u2019re paranoid or socially unaware, you\u2019re not.\n\nIf they cuddle when they sleep in the same bed, they *likely* are romantically involved. I\u2019ve never cuddled with anyone I wasn\u2019t dating, even when I was attracted to women (besides like my mom when I was little and my youngest niece (8) when she has nightmares). I have had several girls who were \u2018best friends\u2019 who have slept in my bed with me or vice versa during frequent sleepovers and we usually sleep with our feet in each other\u2019s faces or someone gets on the floor. \n\nYour daughters love language may just be physical touch. I\u2019d even have her take the love language test for teens. But let me be clear: you have the right to choose not to accept that form of intimacy between them anymore if your suspicions are correct. Then, it\u2019s not platonic and therefore highly inappropriate in a separate room with a closed door in the dark at night while everyone else is sleeping. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible she is trying to weaponize the angle that you *can appear* homophobic in a biased telling of this situation, which she\u2019d have to count on to get away with it. \n\nThen, it doesn\u2019t take you *several* minutes to open a door unless you have to do something before you open the door. That sounds very sus, you\u2019re right. \n\nAnd about the argument that it\u2019s \u2018extreme\u2019 to send her home, absolutely tf not. Your wife got in the car and drove her. She\u2019s fine. If you\u2019d moved her to the couch, you and your wife go to bed, they\u2019re gonna sneak and be together. When you break the rules, sleepover\u2019s over. And your friends mom has to know. Period. Because your 15 year old kid isn\u2019t liable for most of her decisions, and as grown as she feels, it don\u2019t fall on her. In this generation, where it\u2019s so easy to do illegal and inappropriate things, stricter boundaries are needed. Trust me. Besides that, there\u2019s no room for mistakes regarding consent and they need to understand that consent is not just two-party when you are a minor. \n\nMy suggestion is this: She broke a known rule and under highly suspicious circumstances so you sit her down and tell her that the phone\u2019s gone for a period of time. Make it clear that it\u2019s bc she broke a house rule and explain (or reexplain) *exactly* what it looks like. Her reaction should be indicative of if you\u2019re right. You know your kid. \n\nYou\u2019re her parent, she broke a rule, she\u2019s possibly lying. You have every right to look through her phone. That\u2019s a personal decision and I think reserved for extreme circumstances but she\u2019s at the age that kids absolutely *will* do  extremely sexually inappropriate things and post them online or circulate them. I have personal experience with this from multiple family members. Again, you all know your daughter better than Reddit. \n\nMy point is 1) NTA. 2) You absolutely did not overreact. Several minutes is a long time to need to open a door and they need to tell you what they were doing even if they weren\u2019t doing anything sexual bc that\u2019s alarming. 3) Make absolutely certain you know what the dynamic is between the girls before you allow your daughter\u2019s friend back over. That\u2019s not homophobia, that\u2019s enforcing the rules of your home.\n\nEdit: clarity.\n\nEdit: first two drafts made a negative assumption about intimacy. I\u2019m all for platonic physical intimacy between consenting parties, so I fixed the phrasing a bit.", "All these people saying. Why kick them out in the middle of the night!? What are you doing to the guy who climb the window in the middle of the night? They knew the rules and thought they\u2019d use their sexuality against their parents\u2026\u2026.honestly NTA but you do need to have a REAL conversation with your daughter. Not even about her being bi/gay itself, only if she wants. But about that she did use her sexuality to a sneak a s/o. Pregnancy or not safe sex is still important embarrassing or not.", "NTA but at the same time I have never got this rule for same sex couples.  No one is getting pregnant and porn is on all phones with an internet conection.", "YTA\n\nInstead of talking with your daughter you directly removed her friend based on the tellings of a younger sibling. \n\nI want you to think about \"telling of the younger sibling\".", "YTA,\n\nNot because of your rule. Although I do not agree with banning sleepovers with partners until they move out, there needs to be a minimum age somewhere...\n\nKicking someone out gives a very clear signal: \"I do not want you here.\" I think that was the wrong signal to give to your daughters friend.\n\nYou could have let that one night slide and have proper conversation about it with the two girls.\n\nAnd someone should teach 12yo not to snitch on his siblings...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
