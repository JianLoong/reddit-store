Stop thinking about it as your kid trying to break the rules and think about how you just possibly found out something huge about your daughter, and she didn't even get the chance to tell you.\n\nI would take a deep breath, calm down, and go be the parent your daughter needs. Reassure her that you love her. Ask about the relationship and how it started. Let her know she is safe and celebrated. Then, go over the rules again and be sure that expectations are clear. \n\nI knew that my parents weren't homophobic, but I remember how scared I was to come out.

You should also consider removing the lock, because growing up none of us kids ever had that luxury because as kids we never paid the mortgage, so we had no rights to privacy for anything.  You and your wife need to be her parents first.", "NTA - sounds like she had a scare when you almost barged in on them in an intimate moment.

And there is nothing wrong with your rule objectively.\n\nThat being said, you did mention that they \u201ccuddle together when going to sleep\u201d so they have already slept over before?

Thumbs up if you ask me.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your house your rules and it's disrespectful to lock you door at that age if they are fooling around.", "Slight YTA, not for maintaining the rules, but for how you handled the situation in the moment.\n\nYou have to keep in mind a few things. \n\n1) You kicked a teenager out of your house in the middle of the night. That\u2019s dramatic and feels like a punishment. Even if you drove her home, that was a harsh response to a delicate situation. \n2) Your daughter was just outed to you. You are completely accepting which is obviously good, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she was outed. She wasn\u2019t ready to share that with you and it happened suddenly and not at all on her terms. That is a *huge* deal. \n3) The very first thing that happened after she was outed was you guys removing someone she cares about very deeply from your home. \n\nGiven that context and being 15 years old, I don\u2019t think her response was disproportionate to the situation. This whole thing could have been so much smoother if you\u2019d sat both girls down and had an open conversation with them where you could have explained your rules and boundaries and why those are in place.", "Soft YTA. The rule is entirely fair. \n\nBut kicking them out in the middle of the night like that is a bit much. But maybe that\u2019s just me.", "YTA. I get wanting to not have your kids do stuff in the middle of the night, but kicking your daughter\u2019s friend out late at night when you were about to go to bed is extreme. Imagine how awful your daughter\u2019s friend must feel now. That\u2019s the type of stuff that would make her never want to come back to your house, and you\u2019ve either ruined your daughter\u2019s close friendship, or whatever else they may or may not have been doing.\n\nA better solution would have just been to tell them they have to keep the door open, or have a sleepover in your living room or something, as there\u2019s no way they\u2019d do anything then. Then after you could have sat your daughter down and talked to her about things.\n\nAlso, I want to point out, you say your daughter is 15 and you have an older son who you also have the rule of no girlfriends/boyfriends spending the night. That just leads to them doing stuff not in your house where you can\u2019t keep an eye on what is going on.", "YTA not for having rules, but for the way you handled it; as others said, they could have moved to the couch, etc. rather than forcing the friend out late at night. \n\nINFO: Does your daughter have a habit of lying to you? If not, then why believe your son over her? Maybe he just wanted to get her in trouble; he's 12...  Definitely have a talk with your daughter but don't expect it to be easy.", "NTA. I\u2019m 23, have a niece who\u2019s more like a sister who\u2019s 18, and one who\u2019s 12. I\u2019ll tell you that it seems super questionable and almost like you\u2019re paranoid or socially unaware, you\u2019re not.\n\nIf they cuddle when they sleep in the same bed, they *likely* are romantically involved. I\u2019ve never cuddled with anyone I wasn\u2019t dating, even when I was attracted to women (besides like my mom when I was little and my youngest niece (8) when she has nightmares). I have had several girls who were \u2018best friends\u2019 who have slept in my bed with me or vice versa during frequent sleepovers and we usually sleep with our feet in each other\u2019s faces or someone gets on the floor. \n\nYour daughters love language may just be physical touch. I\u2019d even have her take the love language test for teens. But let me be clear: you have the right to choose not to accept that form of intimacy between them anymore if your suspicions are correct. Then, it\u2019s not platonic and therefore highly inappropriate in a separate room with a closed door in the dark at night while everyone else is sleeping. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible she is trying to weaponize the angle that you *can appear* homophobic in a biased telling of this situation, which she\u2019d have to count on to get away with it. \n\nThen, it doesn\u2019t take you *several* minutes to open a door unless you have to do something before you open the door. That sounds very sus, you\u2019re right. \n\nAnd about the argument that it\u2019s \u2018extreme\u2019 to send her home, absolutely tf not. Your wife got in the car and drove her. She\u2019s fine. If you\u2019d moved her to the couch, you and your wife go to bed, they\u2019re gonna sneak and be together. When you break the rules, sleepover\u2019s over. And your friends mom has to know. Period. Because your 15 year old kid isn\u2019t liable for most of her decisions, and as grown as she feels, it don\u2019t fall on her. In this generation, where it\u2019s so easy to do illegal and inappropriate things, stricter boundaries are needed. Trust me. Besides that, there\u2019s no room for mistakes regarding consent and they need to understand that consent is not just two-party when you are a minor. \n\nMy suggestion is this: She broke a known rule and under highly suspicious circumstances so you sit her down and tell her that the phone\u2019s gone for a period of time. Make it clear that it\u2019s bc she broke a house rule and explain (or reexplain) *exactly* what it looks like. Her reaction should be indicative of if you\u2019re right. You know your kid. \n\nYou\u2019re her parent, she broke a rule, she\u2019s possibly lying. You have every right to look through her phone. That\u2019s a personal decision and I think reserved for extreme circumstances but she\u2019s at the age that kids absolutely *will* do  extremely sexually inappropriate things and post them online or circulate them. I have personal experience with this from multiple family members. Again, you all know your daughter better than Reddit. \n\nMy point is 1) NTA. 2) You absolutely did not overreact. Several minutes is a long time to need to open a door and they need to tell you what they were doing even if they weren\u2019t doing anything sexual bc that\u2019s alarming. 3) Make absolutely certain you know what the dynamic is between the girls before you allow your daughter\u2019s friend back over. That\u2019s not homophobia, that\u2019s enforcing the rules of your home.\n\nEdit: clarity.\n\nEdit: first two drafts made a negative assumption about intimacy. I\u2019m all for platonic physical intimacy between consenting parties, so I fixed the phrasing a bit.", "All these people saying. Why kick them out in the middle of the night!? What are you doing to the guy who climb the window in the middle of the night? They knew the rules and thought they\u2019d use their sexuality against their parents\u2026\u2026.honestly NTA but you do need to have a REAL conversation with your daughter. Not even about her being bi/gay itself, only if she wants. But about that she did use her sexuality to a sneak a s/o. Pregnancy or not safe sex is still important embarrassing or not.", "NTA but at the same time I have never got this rule for same sex couples.  No one is getting pregnant and porn is on all phones with an internet conection.", "YTA\n\nInstead of talking with your daughter you directly removed her friend based on the tellings of a younger sibling. \n\nI want you to think about \"telling of the younger sibling\".", "YTA,\n\nNot because of your rule. Although I do not agree with banning sleepovers with partners until they move out, there needs to be a minimum age somewhere...\n\nKicking someone out gives a very clear signal: \"I do not want you here.\" I think that was the wrong signal to give to your daughters friend.\n\nYou could have let that one night slide and have proper conversation about it with the two girls.\n\nAnd someone should teach 12yo not to snitch on his siblings...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't quite fault her for that - especially if she is one of those teenage girls - like I was - that thought they HAD to have been with a girl to know for sure if they were gay/bi/pan. And I'm also hesitant to outright call a 12yo an A.H so I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nSo, hold on a second. Your wife, son and you were chatting about relationships, your son somehow slips into the conversation that \"(daughter) is dating (friend)\" and your wife goes straight up there? I'm curious if the light was already turned out, and also curious as to how it's written, it seems as if your wife tried to open the door before she knocked which also says a lot - Basically I'm getting the impression that although you say your kids are both \"trust-worthy\" that you take your younger son's word more because otherwise you would have just said something to your wife privately and then had a private conversation with your daughter later and then based on that - set new rules. \n\nSide note: Your daughter may not even be lesbian, or bi - she could have even just been experimenting to figure it out because it is a confusing time in her life, especially if she does enjoy cuddling her friend and they are physically close. She could go through her entire sexual life after this friend only having relationships with men and only being with that specific friend and saying \"No, I'm not attracted to women, I was just specifically attracted to X because we were so close\". Which works the same way how a man may not be attracted to overweight women, or disabled women, and then meet the love of their life who happens to be an overweight or disabled woman. That doesn't mean they were wrong about their attraction tastes, it just means that they fell in love with the person not their \"label\".  \n\nI hope the friend is already out to her parents in a loving, supportive home and that you haven't just driven her home to danger. I think a conversation tomorrow is best - with everyone together and separately. Together you need to get everyone to be honest, and have your son tell your daughter what he saw/thinks he saw, and ask him honestly if that's the truth or if he wanted his sister in trouble for something. Then you need to say to your daughter \"well son saw this, and I don't know son to be a liar. What's your side/would you like to talk about anything?\" And then come to an agreement together that suits your boundaries and rules, with your daughter not losing sleepovers completely - because she shouldn't be punished for her assumed sexuality. And then you need to talk to your son about the dangers of outing someone - even accidentally.

The thing is, sex doesn\u2019t only happen at night or at home, they could have sex in a parking lot, or in a car park, or literally anywhere else. It just seems kinda redundant to ban it to me because it\u2019s not actually going to prevent the thing you want it to and it just means they\u2019re probably going to do it in an environment that\u2019s less safe (or still do it in your house just during the day). I\u2019m not sure the age of ur kid but if they\u2019re older teenagers then I don\u2019t really get the point in trying to enforce this because as I\u2019ve said before it\u2019s redundant and if you want them to be safe about sex then just teach them about safe sex.", "YTA.\n\nIt seems the rule you had was no opposite gender sleepovers and she didn't break that rule.

This feels like an important distinction that a lot of people are ignoring.\n\nAdding to that, a few people have already pointed out how hard it could be on her emotionally if she is outed, treated as if she broke a rule, and prevented from seeing her friend/girlfriend all at once, and your overly broad application of this rule just doesn't provide a good justification for this. It's especially egregious because you seem to only be going on hearsay from your son and she may think (possibly correctly) that she simply won't be able to have any of her friends sleep over (either because most of her friends are also girls or because she thinks the opposite gender rule is still in place).\n\nIn short, your rule is very strict, and although it can be manageable for a straight kid who's grown up with it, when you try to suddenly expand it to queer kids it becomes a sudden restriction based on an arbitrary judgement.

Privilege is thinking the daughter is exempt from the same rules as her siblings just because she's gay.\n\nBefore this, the blanket rule was \"no opposite-sex friends\" because the assumption was their children were straight. Now that is no longer the case, they adjusted accordingly and now the specific rule is \"no romantic partners\". The rule is still being applied consistently.\n\nYes, it's unfortunate the daughter was outed before she was ready but the daughter knew what the intent of the rule was. \n\nShe's not being oppressed, she's being dramatic and lashing out because she got caught. Again, this situation has nothing to do with her sexuality directly. She's just being a teenager and pushing boundaries. \n\nThe fact that you argue she should be treated differently just because she is queer is frankly disgusting. Didn't we fight for equality so we'd be treated the same as our straight peers?", "\"If you are not LGBTQA+ member, you cannot call us out when we break rules\".\n\nThis take is so dishonest.

I'd rather know she's safe than pretend my rules will stop teenagers having sex when they want to. However, until she's an adult, I wouldn't want sleepovers with significant others in our home.\n\nThe number of girls at her school who got pregnant or had pregnancy scares was terrifying.

It's developmentally neccessary and teaches them how to excersize autonomy and agency as adults). However if they don't feel like they are successfully negotiating for that autonomy, they will find ways around it, like sneaking out, sneaking someone in, etc, or in some cases, when the parents manage to browbeat the children into behaving, they can easily become people pleasers who don't know got to excersize autonomy and agency as adults, or just move out at 18 and have very little self control, cause there was always an external force to do it for them. \n\n\nMaybe as a compromise, allow a  sleepover once every 2 weeks but it has to be in the living room (for both kids,\n And their respective partners)?

None of us knows what goes on in other peoples homes or minds so we have to assume they are telling the truth, but that doesn\u2019t stop the wildest speculation.", "Sameeeee. I\u2019d spend nights cuddles between my two guy best friends who were gay. Me and my friends cuddle piled a lot", "Just want to shout out to my mom for pretending that taking that long to open a door was a normal, not-suspicious thing to do. She's a real one.", "Thank you so much for that. It means a lot to me.", "she was kissing her girlfriend around the son and having sex with her while everyone was home and walking around? like i understand teens are dumb but that\u2019s just plain careless and the fact so many ppl are accusing OP and the brother of \u201couting\u201d them is absolutely insane.", "So the 12 year old boy is an AH for inadvertently \"outing\" his sister, but the 15 year old daughter isn't AH for going behind her parent's back?", "To be fair, most parents just don't want their kids to be having sex or relations in their house, especially at the age of 15. While it's a debated point, there are plenty of posts here about parents of adult children trying to keep them from sharing a bed with partners. \n\nPersonally, I think OP's point of consistency with the rules (no friends of romantic interest spending the night) is totally fair. To the son, it would be very unfair that his sister's partner/girlfriend/romantic friend can spend the night while his can't. Op needs to sit down and talk to the daughter about why her friend was kicked out, explain their reasoning, apologize for outing her/open a dialogue, and set the rules going forward. \n\nMost people are also hung up on the no opposite gender sleepovers rule and yes, it's very heteronormative, but it doesn't mean OP is homophobic. Times have changed and parents have to adapt now, but for OP this was probably the standard when they grew up. Doesn't make OP a bigot, just someone with some education to do and clarifications to make with the kids.", "Yet she was still upset after OP was obviously fine with it being a girl? They say she\u2019s still upset which means even after explaining that the rules are for everyone, she chooses to believe it\u2019s a homophobia thing. She\u2019s 3 years from 18 and knows what rules are. She took advantage, and that\u2019s all that should be discussed. \n\nEdit : Her even calling him homophobic after does not show she was scared. Thats called weaponizing.", "It\u2019s insane to me that you\u2019re being downvoted so much \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d this guy reeks of toxic masculinity and misogyny given how neither of his kids gave any concrete evidence for either of their claims but his son is \u201ctrustworthy and would never snitch\u201d while his daughter is \u201ckeeping things from her parents to get her way\u201d\n\nalso lmao what happens when either of his kids come out as trans? Guy is gonna have an aneurysm about their maleness and femaleness", "[removed]", "This is an exact copy of u/GothPenguin\u2019s comment. Are you a bot?", "This needs more upvotes honestly . it would be super upsetting to get outed like that and this is all the reaction she gets .", "A lot of teenager actually to do this. They knew that their parents would never find out about this because they can treat each others friends  infront of other people.", "Haha my parents never caught on", "I did gay stuff under my parents\u2019 roof with joyful abandon \ud83c\udf08 \ud83e\udd17", "Agreed. It\u2019s a blanket rule for the house and OP\u2019s daughter knew this. She figured she could get around the rule by saying they were just friends.", "So they shall do it on a gas station restroom? This rule is stupid and dangerous \n\n\nBlaming the kids for doing it at the most responsible place is just bad parenting", "First of all yes, US Americans are very prudish! Europe sent all their prudes here. So thanks for that. \n\nBut it\u2019s also pretty common to not allow sleepovers for romantic partners under 18. My parents were pretty open and discussed sex with me and being responsible and I was definitely not allowed to have my boyfriend sleep in my bed when I was in high school. I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend in college but after college my boyfriend was allowed in my room when we visited because at that point I was an adult and the rule no longer applied. \n\nThe whole \u201cthey\u2019re gonna have sex anyway\u201d thing is what it is. I know I did! We figured it out. Managed to not get caught. But also because my parents did talk to me I also was safe about it.", "I think the point is \"a 15 year old is a child, and parents shouldn't be facilitating their child having sex at that age\" which 100% applies in western Europe.\n\nIt is, a little unusual imo, that they dont let them e.g. sleep on a sofa or guest room, but their house their rules.", "Ummm, last I checked we're talking about a 15-year-old girl. Sex with anyone under the age of 18 is illegal in the US. Parents could do jail time for allowing this.", "Oh that's fucking terrible.", "Why would you feel that way when the rule of the house has been no special friends over night. The daughter definitely thought she was getting away with something and was caught and is now lashing out.", "There have been many a drunken nights where one of us wakes up half naked on top of the other where absolutely nothing sexual happened between us. Even my friend group when I was a teenager.. literally we all made snuggle puddles coed or otherwise. Human touch and intimacy does not need to be inherently sexual. As a troubled kiddo who went through some deep childhood trauma, it made me feel loved, heard, and wanted. That doesn\u2019t mean I fucked all of my LGBT friends. The younger a kid, the more pure their love and affection is.", "As far as your concern. Maybe your son is not lying on purpose but is assuming because he heard she was gay and assume they had to be doing something. He was too quick to snitch.\n\nMy siblings always snitched on me for things that I did not do all the time and my parents did not know they were capable of lying. It hurt that they believed them.\n\nYour son may or not be doing it on purpose but a conversation needs to be done.\n\nYour daughter states it\u2019s not true and you should believe her until she gives you a reason not to.\n\nIt looks like your son was annoying them and that is why she locked the door. He could either 1) lied for revenge because he is a brat or 2) assumed wrong and would not leave them alone and told to use y\u2019all to get you to unlock the door to let him bother them more\n\nI would have a talk with the son as well", "This just happened, I would give the girl some time to calm down and then have a talk with her. Obviously OP is not homophobic, but I\u2019m not gonna dismiss the emotional feelings his daughter is having after having been caught with a girlfriend and having her sexuality come to light. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "Prefrontal cortex will be developed by age 25. That part has to do with seeing consequences for example. \n\nSo she has per definition not a fully developed brain.\n\nThis is a teenager trying to skip houserules by saying it's just a friend. Typically for teenagers though to try and and disobey rules, it's just part of their development. \n\nTherefore parents should be steady when raising their children.", "This is an absolutely stupid comment lmao no one is going to jail because two same age minors are having sex - which is not illegal in most states. I don't think any reasonable person would consider giving a teenage daughter privacy \"facilitation\" because she made the decision to use that privacy to engage in sex. It's just completely absurd.", "I agree siblings lie on each other all the time and the parents chose sides. What you did could affect the way your daughter trusts you. Your son is young and does not understand and only assumed and you took his side. He was probably bother them.\n\nYou need some major damage control with the daughter because your son played ok your paranoia of the gay friend.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t know it but your son was so quick to tattle and something needs to be done\n\nYour daughter says he is lying and you should trust her", "I can\u2019t disagree there, but i\u2019m also not going to act like a 15 year old doesn\u2019t know that they would get in trouble for kissing anyone in the house when it was explicitly against the rules. That\u2019s why the door was locked. OP should have that conversation, but I do think she took advantage and that OP isn\u2019t TA in the slightest for upholding his rules.\n\nHer calling him homophobic after the fact just sounds like she was upset.", "Yeah because people on this sub are always 100% honest about an interaction and never bend the truth for their own gain.", "Absolutely love that you included a definition showing it\u2019s a noun to try and prove the word female is an adjective and not a noun. It can be both depending on context. For what it\u2019s worth, I agree with you that it\u2019s gross and dehumanizing when men use the word \u201cfemales\u201d but to say it\u2019s grammatically incorrect is not true at all.", "My parents still think I only ever liked 1 girl, dated her for 1 year and got married to her. I still laugh when my parents look at me puzzled giving dating advice to my younger cousins.", "This. Kids today have more access to information than ever and therefore can learn *exactly* the buzzwords to use. They often *know* what to say to get you to question just enough so they can get away with it until it\u2019s unavoidable. It\u2019s unfortunate but growing more common for them to weaponize genuine facets of their identity because they know the connotation of the accusations.\n\nEdit: less presumptuous language", "She doesn't even experience how to be a kid all of his life. I feel pity on him because he was doing something cringe here.", "A lot of people in these comments demonstrating that they cannot relate to a 15 year old girl in this situation. Regardless of her intent, this is potentially traumatic and making sure she feels safe should be #1 priority. Any breaking of boundaries on the daughters behalf should be acknowledged, but at the same time this isn't a fully formed adult, this is a teenager coping with a distressing situation. The parents rules should be there to service her path through adolescence for the sake of her well-being, her breaking them should not betray that principal.", "Wtf even is this lmao\n\nYes, children are sitting online looking up just the right buzzwords to use.
