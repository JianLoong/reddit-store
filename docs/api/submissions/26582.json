I\u2019m probably doing better than most people around my age. My parents are both immigrants and they have worked so much to give their 6 daughters a house, food, clothes etc. we were never rich, in fact we were very poor.

The problem is, I have this immense amount of guilt because my parents are still struggling with money. I help them any way I can. I\u2019ve been paying their internet for 5 years now while also paying me & my bfs internet, I give them $100-$300 for Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, birthdays or Christmas and I have no idea what they do to that money.

I am not in as dire straits as I used to be, however I do still struggle. My oldest is 25, in grad school and just got a full time job making really good money, while my youngest got a security job also making great money. They both live at home, for now. I do not ask them for any money because they are both saving to pay for their education, housing when they move out, and transportation. I do not ever want my kids to help me financially, what I really want is for them to be able to take care of themselves with the resources that they have and not to struggle in their own lives as I have struggled. If they do that, I feel like I\u2019ve done my job and can be proud.", "I see no conflict as they are not asking. You are already helping within your means. NTA.

Maybe that is why you feel guilty. \n\nYour bf can easily say don't help but is that the same for his family? \n\nAlso ask your other sibling that can help, how you both can make meaningful contributions to their lives. \n\nI'll get downvoted for this but I will not be happy if it is no skin off my nose to help out my parents that sacrificed so much and I'm now hiding behind my bf and pointing fingers at others. \n\nAll the best.", "NAH. \n\nI'd try to work with them on budgeting and their plans for retirement.

And tell your spouse the truth, hiding it won\u2019t help in long run", "NTA, it's good that you keep looking out for your parents and probably a few hundred dollars here and there won't make a huge dent in your income. Once all the kids have moved out and made their way hopefully your parents' financial situation will become more stable, at some point you might want to suggest they speak to a financial advisor to think about their retirement because in the US it's brutal. And your mother can always find some kind of job, preferably one which has health insurance. It's not your burden to bear.", "But, OP, do not do anything that puts your future at risk. Think if it this way - how can you help them in the future if you are not doing well? Or, flip it around - you will be able to help them so much more if, in the future, you are that much more successful.\n\nSo, ensure your loans are paid off. Ensure you can pay for current/future education if that is in the plan. Ensure you can pay for a mortgage if you buy a home.\n\nIs there reliable health insurance in your country? Can you perhaps pay for that? That would benefit your parents as they get older. That is an example of something you can pay for directly so you know your money is benefitting your parents. \n\nAlso, if you see a future with BF, be open to him about your payments to your parents. He will find out eventually - if you are not open to him about this and he finds out, he may see it as you not being honest with him.", "I'm American and that got me too. I don't understand.
