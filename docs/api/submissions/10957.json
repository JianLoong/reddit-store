She i get her every two weeks and she\u2019ll come and live with me and my fianc\u00e9e. I work as an ER nurse so I have weird shifts sometimes, this leaves my fianc\u00e9e and daughter alone together a lot. I thought it\u2019d would be good for them to get some girl time with each other. I was wrong, they don\u2019t really get along (part of me thinks it\u2019s her mother\u2019s influence because her mother HATES my fianc\u00e9e). \n\nSo this situation started Friday night. That morning she asked me she could go out with some friends that night and I said sure. Her curfew is 11pm which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable for a teenage girl. She knows this and knows she will be punished if she doesn\u2019t show at 11. That night I had to work so I asked my fianc\u00e9e to make sure she was back home safe and sound by 11. I\u2019ve never had a problem with her missing curfew, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. I went to work at 8pm and didn\u2019t make it home till around 9AM.\n\nWhen I got home my fianc\u00e9e was up and clearly distraught. She told me that my daughter came back home passed curfew and when she confronted her on it, my daughter lost her temper and went off. After talking to her, I spoke to my daughter who said that she was only a few minutes late and that my girlfriend overreacted and tried to punish her.\n\nSo typically I don\u2019t like to take sides and just try to find some middle ground between them, but this time I could actually check everything by looking out our home sec cameras. My daughter didn\u2019t get home until 1AM. I interpreted this as my daughter not being fully truthful so I sided with my partner. I punished my daughter by taking her car keys and stopping her allowance.\n\nShe and her mother have in response both accused me of caring more about my fianc\u00e9e more than my daughter which isn\u2019t true.\n\nAITA?\u201d\u201d", "created_utc": 1677415589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cg8fr/aita_for_siding_with_my35_fianc\u00e9e26_over_my/", "score": 1009, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have 2 active parents. It is my job to be safe and respectful and participate. I enforce basic house rules for the youngest, but I don't decide the punishments or get into fights with them about things. I inform DH and he deals with that, as its his job to parent his children. I'm saying he's a bit of an AH for expecting his fiance to deal with the punishment and enforcing. In her position I would have called DH because I was worried and after she was home safe it would be up to him to deal with his daughter. \n\nI would never punish or enforce my 17 Step daughter, we have a great relationship because of that. I'm a safe person for her but not her parent.", "Still not her right. \nShe has no authority over your child that is only 9 years younger than her. I would've laughed in her face.\nYour daughter missing curfew is between you and your daughter.

Kid came home two hours late.  Fianc\u00e9e has EVERY RIGHT to say \u2018your dad was clear, and you know your curfew\u2019.  She does NOT have to \u2018be\u2019 the parent", "She wasn't trying to be the parent, she was trying to do what the parent asked. Maybe dad should step up and I don't know, be the parent, instead of putting the bad guy part of parenting on his fianc\u00e9e, but it sounds like he doesn't always do that.  OP is kind of the TA because he knows his daughter, for whatever reason, doesn't like or respect his fianc\u00e9e. The instructions should have been, 'let me know if she comes home by curfew and whatnot and I'll take care of it in the morning.\"  That way the fianc\u00e9e is monitoring the daughter but not interacting with her.", "How do you get that from the post.  So by your reasoning, the fiance should say NOTHING.  Him, did daughter come home at 11?, her SILENCE.  When did she come home?  SILENCE.  How in the hell can do any parenting if he is not informed.  OP is nta.", "Because people are judging you for dating someone 8 years older than your teenager and then leaving that someone in a position of authority over the teenager. There is zero chance your daughter is ever going to have a positive relationship with your fianc\u00e9e if you keep doing that.", "Because you are expecting your 17 year old yo respect your 26 year old as a parental figure when she is not one. \nShe shouldn't involve herself in any of this. You are the one that need to parent your child. Your girlfriend should stay in her lane.", "Welcome to Reddit \ud83d\ude09. Probably that their relationship is so new that fianc\u00e9e trying to exert authority over a young woman only 9 years younger is sketch.", "Again, OP'S fault. He needs to understand his child will never respect a woman that is 9 years older than her. HIS  JOB IS TO parent his child. NOT to leave his girlfriend to do it.  Thus girl is 17 she doesn't need a babysitter or someone to \"watch\" her.\nHe is wrong and he will make his daughter hate his fiancee even more because he can't be bothered to parent and want to outsource that.", "This. ESH", "\u201cHey it\u2019s 2 hours past your curfew, I was worried where you are. I\u2019m gonna have to tell you dad that you didn\u2019t get back her before 11.\u201d", "Lol you are proving my point further. \n\nYou are reading between the lines but brought out his whole history and reasons for divorce ? Yeah sure mate. Assumptions max. \n\nDivorce is always hard and especially for the kid. That's not even the issue here. Dad is moving on with a new person... That doesn't mean the kid has to like her. It's her wish and she can take her time to be comfortable and all dad can do is provide that atmosphere and let her know that he's gonna be there for her. \n\nBut this is a mistake from the girl clearly. Whether it was the fiancee who was there in that house or the father the result would still be punishment. Imagine the dad was in the house and she didn't come at 11... Don't you think he would be worried sick and he would make calls and ask her location? And even after that if she came at 1 she would have been punished for sure. So what's different here ? \n\nShe came late because she knew her dad was at work. That's taking advantage and she was wrong for it. Dad is trying his best to be diplomatic and didn't let her bad mouth the fiancee for just being there and confronting. \n\nYou on the other hand mate need to get some calm in life. Hope things go good for you unlike the advices that you give.", "So the fianc\u00e9e should have called or texted daughter once at 11 and said, \"I'm concerned. I was told your curfew is at 11 and that you're always good about being home by curfew. Are you okay? Do you need anything?\" Then let the daughter come home at 1am and told OP. OP could then check cameras, talk to his daughter, and punish as needed/ as he thought was appropriate, without involving his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nExpecting a teenager to respond well to a 26-year-old who is not their parent attempting to parent them is unreasonable. Fiancee should never have been put in the position of parenting in this case. Fianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for trying to enforce consequences/ \"confront\" daughter.\n\nESH. Daughter shouldn't have tried to take advantage by pushing her curfew by two hours, fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have confronted the daughter or be trying to parent at all given the ages involved, OP should not be putting his fianc\u00e9e in this position, etc.\n\nPlus, the assumption here is simply that the daughter is trying to get one over the fianc\u00e9e and that may not be a fair assumption. She's a kid with divorced parents who clearly don't get along and her father is about to marry someone much younger. She's frequently left alone with her father's fianc\u00e9e who she doesn't like (do you really think she then wants to be there) and her father is naive enough to think she should have \"girl time\" with that fianc\u00e9e. Meanwhile her mother is making it clear she doesn't like that. In other words, she's likely a pretty troubled kid right now in the middle of an impossible situation who just did something out of character. \n\nIf she usually comes home on time and blatantly didn't this time, the first response should have been concern for her and some questions about why before punishment and confrontation were even in place. She should be punished, once for breaking curfew and once for lying, but someone should at least be talking to her about what she was out doing and why she decided to ignore her curfew this time. She's incredibly vulnerable right now given her age, the fact that her parents can't get along well enough to co-parent effectively, the fact that she's with a parent working long hours in a stressful job and who likely is distracted by an upcoming wedding and the fact that she's being left alone with her parent's much younger partner who is inappropriately trying to parent. She's going to be a legal adult in a year and able to do whatever she wants anyways and her father was about her age when he had her (she can likely do that math and probably is at a stage where him trying to control her given that fact feels hypocritical). It's probably time to have a talk with her about what is going on in her head and how she feels about the choices her parents are making in addition to any punishments that seem appropriate. She's at the stage where it makes way more sense to try to resolve conflicts with her like an adult before going straight to punishment.\n\nOP has less than a year left where he can expect her to come around based on a custody plan or expect to be able to \"punish\" her. It's poor parenting at this point to just take car keys and stop an allowance.", "That\u2019s fine. All fianc\u00e9e needs to do is tell OP that daughter was 2 hours late. Asking her to check is not the same as asking her to punish the daughter. \n\nAlthough I do feel that daughter might be exaggerating the \u201cpunishment\u201d as she has clearly lied about how late she was and is probably lying to her mother about the situation.", "But she took it upon herself to confront and punish her. Not her lane.", "That doesn\u2019t mean she has the unilateral authority to dole out punishment either tho. ESH. Daughter, father, fianc\u00e9, and the mother all suck.", "YTA\n1. OP was dead wrong to put the fiancee in that position in the first place, (over a seventeen year old for cryin out loud) and\n2. if the fiancee had any sense or wisdom she would not have accepted the tattling as a task. \nBut \n3. she does NOT have sense or wisdom about that situation, and shouldn't be expected to, because she's too young AND too inexperienced, and\n4. her youth and inexperience is why OP was attracted to her in the first place.\n\nHE set up a power struggle between two young women and now he's mad his daughter is not treating her big sister--whoops, I mean stepmom to be--as an actual parent.\n\nThis whole thing is on him. He can use the camera as the babysitter/snitch in future instead of the fiancee.\n\n[Edited to add the Y T A and also tried to make it display the numbers as I wanted it to, unfruitfully]", "If you keep relegating your parenting duties to your fianc\u00e9e, you would just be constantly pitting them against each other.", "That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I think the word choice of \u201cconfronting\u201d/\u201ccalling her out\u201d is throwing people.", "The thing is, we only have the daughter's word that the fianc\u00e9e \"tried to punish her\". The same daughter who was \"only a few minutes late\". The only thing we know happened is that the fianc\u00e9e \"confronted her\" which might as well be saying \"you're in big trouble when your dad gets home\". Everybody here is talking as if the fianc\u00e9e grounded her for a week or smth when there's absolutely no indication that this happened.", "You are assuming the fianc\u00e9e has the daughter's number.  If they don't get along, there is a good chance that she doesn't. But even if she did have the daughter's number, I have a feeling that the fianc\u00e9e texting the daughter to check up on her wouldn't have had a good outcome, either. To the daughter, it probably would have felt like overstepping.  \n\nAnd, we have no idea if the fianc\u00e9e actually tried to punish the daughter, just that she confronted her which could have been something along the lines of \"Where have you been?  Do you know what time it is? You were supposed to be home two hours ago!\"  followed by a \"When your dad hears about this....\"  That could have easily set the daughter off because 1)   \n the fianc\u00e9e was checking up on her and questioning her, and 2) the fianc\u00e9e is going to tell on her so she is going to get in trouble.  The daughter bold-faced lied about how late she was, so I would question if anything she told her dad about that night was the truth or if it was a ploy to take the heat off her for breaking curfew and lying about it.", "I didn't read anywhere that fiance attempted any punishment, only confronted daughter about being late.  She definitely should have confronted her and told her I will inform your father.  This seems to be what occurred.  OP is nta.", "As I said upthread, we only have the word of the known liar for the punishment part, and \"confront\" could mean anything.", "(It keeps turning my 4 into another 3 and I don't know why, sorry)", "Confronting her was already a misstep. As would be a threat like \"you're in trouble when your dad gets home.\"\n\nShe should absolutely not have confronted her at all.\n\nThat is trying to parent out of place.\n\nEven saying \"you're in big trouble when your dad gets home\" would have been highly inappropriate. That's trying to threaten the girl with punishment using the father and any teenager is going to see through that and be offended by it.\n\nShe could have let the father talk to and punish the daughter appropriately without a confrontation. There was no scenario where a confrontation was going to go well at 1am when daughter had been out late and fiancee was stressed. The teenager yelling at her was a very predictable consequence of her choice to engage and escalated a situation that did not need to be escalated at that point. She had no actual authority to punish the daughter and both of them knew that. So any confrontation was merely creating a conflict. They already don\u2019t get along, it just reinforced the animosity for no reason. \n\nShe could have discreetly said something to the father and he could have then checked the cameras and talked to his daughter.\n\nShe's not the parent to a 17 year old and trying to pretend she is is only going to create further conflict. It's laughable given the ages of all involved. Daughter\u2019s likely not an idiot, her own father was out conceiving her when he was 17-18 and he\u2019s now leaving her alone with his much younger partner. Her own parents are interested in getting along well enough to co-parent effectively. The 26 year old stepping in at 1am to try to enforce a curfew was absolutely unnecessary and futile. What was she going to actually be able to do to daughter except say \u201cI\u2019m telling\u201d like an immature older sibling?  Daughter is at the age where she likely thinks the curfew is bullshit anyway. Everyone involved would have been better off if OP started by talking to his daughter about why the curfew is needed, whether she was safe, why she\u2019s acting out right now, etc. and then merited out punishment.\n\nNow they\u2019ve got a situation where the daughter thinks she is being punished for getting into it with the fianc\u00e9e who tried to inappropriately parent her and where that is being reinforced by daughter\u2019s mother. \n\nSo nothing was learned here by daughter expect that fianc\u00e9e is overstepping. Which means the animosity and lack of respect will only increase. \n\nAny attempt on the fianc\u00e9es part to talk to the daughter as though she has authority over daughter was a punishment in this case. She should have let the actual parents parent.\n\nShe likely doesn't know any better because she's 26 and therefore in no position to be parenting a teenager.

OP was at work and asked his fiancee to keep an eye out since the daughter was supposed to be home by 11. Fiancee (the adult) obviously had to stay up until 1am waiting and was probably annoyed. I wouldn't fault her for being irritated just like I wouldn't fault the daughter for being irritated about the dynamic. If OP wasn't at work everything changes but he literally wasn't home to make sure his daughter was following the rules. All we know is his daughter who was only \"a couple minutes late\" (2 hours) also says fiancee \"punished her\" but gives not further context. Making a comment like your dad will be pissed isn't truly a bad thing. Teenagers can act like they hate their real parents when they get caught and punished.\n\nThe real problem that needs to be addressed is the family dynamic. You don't have to view the young fiancee as a parent figure to recognize they were the adult in charge of you. Sometimes siblings are given authority over brothers/sisters only a year younger than them. If my parents told me so and so was in charge than I listened all the way up until I was old enough to make my own decisions. Therapy or joint sessions with Dad and daughter only seem in line. There is an underlying issue here.", "She clearly DOES need a babysitter.

It has to do with respect. \n\nNowwww not all adults deserve respect. I think we have to earn it. So the daughter not respecting fiancee could be for several valid reasons. She might not appreciate dad having a new wife If the separation happened anytime recently. There might be an underlying issue with fiancee. Maybe no attempts to bond (not as parent/child but as a person who will be a part of your life) didn't work because dad just leaves them alone together instead of taking initiative as the bio parent to facilitate. Dad and daughter need therapy or counseling, they need to figure this all out together and the daughter needs to feel their opinion matters before anything else can be done. This is over the head of AITA.", "Tell that to all of the new teachers who start teaching high school after they graduate college.", "Do you think teachers, babysitters, older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles have no right to be in-charge of children who are a decade younger than them?

She should have kept her mouth shut and just reported back to the actual parent. Everyone sucks in this situation, the parent shouldn\u2019t have put his partner in this position nor his kid especially knowing how his kid feels about his partner. The partner didn\u2019t have to say anything and just should have reported back like asked.

You think the teen is going to like every boss or teacher (or professor perhaps) in life? Of course not. And some will likely be young women not much older than her. When I was 16 my shift manager was a 20 yo woman. I still learned how to take directions, be disciplined, etc from her, despite me not seeing her really as an authority figure.
