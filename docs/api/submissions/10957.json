She i get her every two weeks and she\u2019ll come and live with me and my fianc\u00e9e. I work as an ER nurse so I have weird shifts sometimes, this leaves my fianc\u00e9e and daughter alone together a lot. I thought it\u2019d would be good for them to get some girl time with each other. I was wrong, they don\u2019t really get along (part of me thinks it\u2019s her mother\u2019s influence because her mother HATES my fianc\u00e9e). \n\nSo this situation started Friday night. That morning she asked me she could go out with some friends that night and I said sure. Her curfew is 11pm which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable for a teenage girl. She knows this and knows she will be punished if she doesn\u2019t show at 11. That night I had to work so I asked my fianc\u00e9e to make sure she was back home safe and sound by 11. I\u2019ve never had a problem with her missing curfew, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. I went to work at 8pm and didn\u2019t make it home till around 9AM.\n\nWhen I got home my fianc\u00e9e was up and clearly distraught. She told me that my daughter came back home passed curfew and when she confronted her on it, my daughter lost her temper and went off. After talking to her, I spoke to my daughter who said that she was only a few minutes late and that my girlfriend overreacted and tried to punish her.\n\nSo typically I don\u2019t like to take sides and just try to find some middle ground between them, but this time I could actually check everything by looking out our home sec cameras. My daughter didn\u2019t get home until 1AM. I interpreted this as my daughter not being fully truthful so I sided with my partner. I punished my daughter by taking her car keys and stopping her allowance.\n\nShe and her mother have in response both accused me of caring more about my fianc\u00e9e more than my daughter which isn\u2019t true.\n\nAITA?\u201d\u201d", "created_utc": 1677415589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cg8fr/aita_for_siding_with_my35_fianc\u00e9e26_over_my/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have unquestioningly sided with your fiance when your teenager admitted to being back after curfew. \n\nFinding a \"middle-ground\" when there was already a rule that represented a middle-ground is a way of you personally avoiding the difficult job of enacting your own discipline.

She definitely shouldn\u2019t have been two hours late or lied about it but also if you want your daughter and fianc\u00e9 to form a relationship putting fianc\u00e9 in a parent role probably isn\u2019t the way to do it. Your daughter is not going to easily accept someone new telling her what to do or thinking they get to punish her, especially at 17. You should\u2019ve told your fianc\u00e9 to tell you if she got home on time so you can handle it, not take it upon herself to confront your daughter for being late.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\n1am is more than a few minutes late, what was daughter's explanation to that?", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter referred to your FIANC\u00c9E as your \"girlfriend\"? There is a clear lack of respect for your relationship with your SO. And your ex may very well have an influence here. \n\nStand your ground, but be gentle. Maybe you could spend more time with your daughter vs trying to make her spend more time with someone she clearly dislikes because of your odd hours?", "This is the most reasonable take. Only person who doesn\u2019t suck here is the fianc\u00e9.", "Fianc\u00e9e should have been there to report back to OP and not enforce a consequence. However, they are getting married and if the daughter will be staying with them she should have respect and courtesy toward the fianc\u00e9e. I would be incredibly worried if my soon to be stepchild came home 2 hours late, I\u2019m sure fianc\u00e9e was upset because the responsibility was given to her. I do agree, ESH.", "Further add on: why would you think this (being a \"parent\") would be a great idea if your daughter already doesn't like her? Doesn't that just reinforce the negative feelings?", "He shouldn't have left it to his fianc\u00e9e to handle the situation though. She clearly has no authority over his daughter who is just eight years younger than her. His 'support' for his fianc\u00e9e should consist of doing these sort of things himself from now on.", "This 100%, have you explained your reasoning to your daughter and more importantly her mother?", "They met 2 years ago", "This.", "I think you mean \u201cyour partner should *not* be punishing your daughter\u201d but other than that I agree with this take wholeheartedly. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s father married someone 18 yrs younger than him (and 11 yrs older than me) it\u2019s just not possible to see that person as an authority figure. Neither the fianc\u00e9e nor the daughter should have been put in this position. It was always going to be a problem.", "I love this response.  Then dad had to WORK.  His wife is a responsible adult.  The daughter scared her and when she came home she bull dozed her.", "This, the age gap is too small to expect anything good if your girlfriend try to parent your daughter. You should just had asked your daughter to respect the curfew and your girlfriend to send you a text once your daughter came home. Then you could punish her by yourself.\nSo YTA for the way you handle things", "The man she cheated on me with didn\u2019t stay with her after she ruined our marriage. Now she\u2019s bitter that I have someone who loves me while she is still alone with no one", "BS. FULL NTA.\n\nThe fiance plays an active role in parenting and its up to the daughter and her birth mother to realize that the girl has 2 sets of parents who make and enforce the rules.\n\nThe daughter doesn't get to get away with coming home at 1am because she doesn't have to respect the fiance enforcing the rules. Between the daughter and fiance, there is 1 adult and 1 child.", "Especially when OP has cameras. He could\u2019ve just checked them himself without making his fianc\u00e9e have to be the bad guy.", "This. She comes to see her dad, not her dad's gf.", "His daughter lied about being a few minutes late. A few minutes like 2 hours late.  What's to say she's not lying about the fianc\u00e9e trying to punish her?", "Your daughter Lied!  Good for You!  Truly.  Supporting your spouse is a beautiful thing.\n\nYour daughter is clearly lying, and manipulating, other people to paint uou as the bad guy. \n\nAnd these people saying, \"ESH \" are ridiculous.   She was the adult in the home responsible for your daughters safety.   Of course she should be upset and SAY something.", "I mean yeah he\u2019s the one who gave out the punishments, not her", "Finally, a reasonable response. 11pm curfew for a 17-year old and if not punishment? CRINGE.", "Lol he works in the ER mate. As a person being in medical field who has to earn money too...it's not easy to just come and go with a fixed job. And it's one day he requested his fiancee to just oversee the situation and usually his daughter who is 17 (hormones or not, one can see the time and also know the right from wrong) \n\nI would love to see you being busy the whole day unable to be there at 2 places and ending up in this situation before commenting on this post. \n\nYou seem to be an asshole here mate to just assume these things. \n\nI'm sure the Dad is doing his best to take care of his daughter.", "what are you on? that's exactly what he did. He listened to both of them before reviewing the security footage. the punishment came after. also he didnt force them to spend time together. he just wanted his fiancee to make sure she got home on time. did you even read the post?", "Depends on how much she forces her \u201cauthority\u201d in the daughter. But from what\u2019s there I think you\u2019re right", "You're in a pretty tough spot. Your fiancee doesn't have a relationship with her where she can enforce rules, and that's enforced by the mom. 3 hours late is no small thing, and in fact rather terrifying. Is she allowed this behavior at her mom's house? How would the mom react if that had happened on her watch? \n\nYou could set the rule that if she can't be trusted to be home on time when you are at work, she can't go out, but she's 17 and about to be of legal age and that too can blow up in your face. \n\nHave you guys ever done family therapy?", "Ah thank you for catching that! Definitely meant *not* punishing.\n\nYeah I'm imagining a 26 year old trying to punish 17 year old me and I would have laughed in their face and just not ever visited them if my dad tried to make it so they could give me punishments.\n\nLike the partner in this story and yours is not old enough for \"respect your elders\" to apply, and therefore comes under \"respect has to be earned\". And then would only earn respect by understanding there is not a big enough age difference between us for them to ever have the authority to punish me.", "Too bad for your ex.", "The fianc\u00e9e is only eight years older than the daughter. My teenage children wouldn't listen to someone in their twenties either.\nHe is her father, he should be the one who gets to talk to/discipline his daughter.", "Well, she shouldn\u2019t be playing an active parent role and that\u2019s the point. They\u2019re close enough in age to be sisters. And I am going to say, they\u2019re alone a lot we don\u2019t actually know how fianc\u00e9 acts towards her, some kids keep their mouths shut about it. Either way this is an ESH", "Shitty excuse after shitty excuse. You make a mistake as a father, you own it. By being more present, i meant when he *can* be available. It is clear they aren't close as they could be, probably as a result of the divorce. I am assuming nothing - only, reading between the lines. \n\nI work full-time, have had 60 hour work weeks for months on end, have taken care of people while working full-time... yeah, no. You are a bum if you think you can use your job as an excuse to be an absentee father. \n\nOP, own your shit and don't listen to this fool. Yeah, you got kinda screwed by your ex and all, but still. You could do better man, your daughter *needs* you right now (fathers are suppppper important in the teenage years for girls), and it won't be forever. I might be harsh, i can be an asshole, but someone gotta tell it to you straight.\n\nBe the biggest person in the situation, take responsibility, lead by example. Show her you're there, even when she makes mistakes, and will try to understand and work with her. What this australian dude doesn't realize is, social media encourages (directly or through influencing others who influence her)  younger people to make poor decisions, and kids these days need strong role-models more than we ever did.", "I mean (not in this situation) he does say because of his work he often has to leave them alone together"]}
