She i get her every two weeks and she\u2019ll come and live with me and my fianc\u00e9e. I work as an ER nurse so I have weird shifts sometimes, this leaves my fianc\u00e9e and daughter alone together a lot. I thought it\u2019d would be good for them to get some girl time with each other. I was wrong, they don\u2019t really get along (part of me thinks it\u2019s her mother\u2019s influence because her mother HATES my fianc\u00e9e). \n\nSo this situation started Friday night. That morning she asked me she could go out with some friends that night and I said sure. Her curfew is 11pm which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable for a teenage girl. She knows this and knows she will be punished if she doesn\u2019t show at 11. That night I had to work so I asked my fianc\u00e9e to make sure she was back home safe and sound by 11. I\u2019ve never had a problem with her missing curfew, so I didn\u2019t worry about it. I went to work at 8pm and didn\u2019t make it home till around 9AM.\n\nWhen I got home my fianc\u00e9e was up and clearly distraught. She told me that my daughter came back home passed curfew and when she confronted her on it, my daughter lost her temper and went off. After talking to her, I spoke to my daughter who said that she was only a few minutes late and that my girlfriend overreacted and tried to punish her.\n\nSo typically I don\u2019t like to take sides and just try to find some middle ground between them, but this time I could actually check everything by looking out our home sec cameras. My daughter didn\u2019t get home until 1AM. I interpreted this as my daughter not being fully truthful so I sided with my partner. I punished my daughter by taking her car keys and stopping her allowance.\n\nShe and her mother have in response both accused me of caring more about my fianc\u00e9e more than my daughter which isn\u2019t true.\n\nAITA?\u201d\u201d", "created_utc": 1677415589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cg8fr/aita_for_siding_with_my35_fianc\u00e9e26_over_my/", "score": 1556, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have 2 active parents. It is my job to be safe and respectful and participate. I enforce basic house rules for the youngest, but I don't decide the punishments or get into fights with them about things. I inform DH and he deals with that, as its his job to parent his children. I'm saying he's a bit of an AH for expecting his fiance to deal with the punishment and enforcing. In her position I would have called DH because I was worried and after she was home safe it would be up to him to deal with his daughter. \n\nI would never punish or enforce my 17 Step daughter, we have a great relationship because of that. I'm a safe person for her but not her parent.", "Still not her right. \nShe has no authority over your child that is only 9 years younger than her. I would've laughed in her face.\nYour daughter missing curfew is between you and your daughter.

Kid came home two hours late.  Fianc\u00e9e has EVERY RIGHT to say \u2018your dad was clear, and you know your curfew\u2019.  She does NOT have to \u2018be\u2019 the parent", "She wasn't trying to be the parent, she was trying to do what the parent asked. Maybe dad should step up and I don't know, be the parent, instead of putting the bad guy part of parenting on his fianc\u00e9e, but it sounds like he doesn't always do that.  OP is kind of the TA because he knows his daughter, for whatever reason, doesn't like or respect his fianc\u00e9e. The instructions should have been, 'let me know if she comes home by curfew and whatnot and I'll take care of it in the morning.\"  That way the fianc\u00e9e is monitoring the daughter but not interacting with her.", "How do you get that from the post.  So by your reasoning, the fiance should say NOTHING.  Him, did daughter come home at 11?, her SILENCE.  When did she come home?  SILENCE.  How in the hell can do any parenting if he is not informed.  OP is nta.", "Because people are judging you for dating someone 8 years older than your teenager and then leaving that someone in a position of authority over the teenager. There is zero chance your daughter is ever going to have a positive relationship with your fianc\u00e9e if you keep doing that.", "Because you are expecting your 17 year old yo respect your 26 year old as a parental figure when she is not one. \nShe shouldn't involve herself in any of this. You are the one that need to parent your child. Your girlfriend should stay in her lane.", "Welcome to Reddit \ud83d\ude09. Probably that their relationship is so new that fianc\u00e9e trying to exert authority over a young woman only 9 years younger is sketch.", "Again, OP'S fault. He needs to understand his child will never respect a woman that is 9 years older than her. HIS  JOB IS TO parent his child. NOT to leave his girlfriend to do it.  Thus girl is 17 she doesn't need a babysitter or someone to \"watch\" her.\nHe is wrong and he will make his daughter hate his fiancee even more because he can't be bothered to parent and want to outsource that.", "This. ESH", "\u201cHey it\u2019s 2 hours past your curfew, I was worried where you are. I\u2019m gonna have to tell you dad that you didn\u2019t get back her before 11.\u201d", "Lol you are proving my point further. \n\nYou are reading between the lines but brought out his whole history and reasons for divorce ? Yeah sure mate. Assumptions max. \n\nDivorce is always hard and especially for the kid. That's not even the issue here. Dad is moving on with a new person... That doesn't mean the kid has to like her. It's her wish and she can take her time to be comfortable and all dad can do is provide that atmosphere and let her know that he's gonna be there for her. \n\nBut this is a mistake from the girl clearly. Whether it was the fiancee who was there in that house or the father the result would still be punishment. Imagine the dad was in the house and she didn't come at 11... Don't you think he would be worried sick and he would make calls and ask her location? And even after that if she came at 1 she would have been punished for sure. So what's different here ? \n\nShe came late because she knew her dad was at work. That's taking advantage and she was wrong for it. Dad is trying his best to be diplomatic and didn't let her bad mouth the fiancee for just being there and confronting. \n\nYou on the other hand mate need to get some calm in life. Hope things go good for you unlike the advices that you give.", "So the fianc\u00e9e should have called or texted daughter once at 11 and said, \"I'm concerned. I was told your curfew is at 11 and that you're always good about being home by curfew. Are you okay? Do you need anything?\" Then let the daughter come home at 1am and told OP. OP could then check cameras, talk to his daughter, and punish as needed/ as he thought was appropriate, without involving his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nExpecting a teenager to respond well to a 26-year-old who is not their parent attempting to parent them is unreasonable. Fiancee should never have been put in the position of parenting in this case. Fianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for trying to enforce consequences/ \"confront\" daughter.\n\nESH. Daughter shouldn't have tried to take advantage by pushing her curfew by two hours, fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have confronted the daughter or be trying to parent at all given the ages involved, OP should not be putting his fianc\u00e9e in this position, etc.\n\nPlus, the assumption here is simply that the daughter is trying to get one over the fianc\u00e9e and that may not be a fair assumption. She's a kid with divorced parents who clearly don't get along and her father is about to marry someone much younger. She's frequently left alone with her father's fianc\u00e9e who she doesn't like (do you really think she then wants to be there) and her father is naive enough to think she should have \"girl time\" with that fianc\u00e9e. Meanwhile her mother is making it clear she doesn't like that. In other words, she's likely a pretty troubled kid right now in the middle of an impossible situation who just did something out of character. \n\nIf she usually comes home on time and blatantly didn't this time, the first response should have been concern for her and some questions about why before punishment and confrontation were even in place. She should be punished, once for breaking curfew and once for lying, but someone should at least be talking to her about what she was out doing and why she decided to ignore her curfew this time. She's incredibly vulnerable right now given her age, the fact that her parents can't get along well enough to co-parent effectively, the fact that she's with a parent working long hours in a stressful job and who likely is distracted by an upcoming wedding and the fact that she's being left alone with her parent's much younger partner who is inappropriately trying to parent. She's going to be a legal adult in a year and able to do whatever she wants anyways and her father was about her age when he had her (she can likely do that math and probably is at a stage where him trying to control her given that fact feels hypocritical). It's probably time to have a talk with her about what is going on in her head and how she feels about the choices her parents are making in addition to any punishments that seem appropriate. She's at the stage where it makes way more sense to try to resolve conflicts with her like an adult before going straight to punishment.\n\nOP has less than a year left where he can expect her to come around based on a custody plan or expect to be able to \"punish\" her. It's poor parenting at this point to just take car keys and stop an allowance.", "That\u2019s fine. All fianc\u00e9e needs to do is tell OP that daughter was 2 hours late. Asking her to check is not the same as asking her to punish the daughter. \n\nAlthough I do feel that daughter might be exaggerating the \u201cpunishment\u201d as she has clearly lied about how late she was and is probably lying to her mother about the situation.", "But she took it upon herself to confront and punish her. Not her lane.", "That doesn\u2019t mean she has the unilateral authority to dole out punishment either tho. ESH. Daughter, father, fianc\u00e9, and the mother all suck.", "YTA\n1. OP was dead wrong to put the fiancee in that position in the first place, (over a seventeen year old for cryin out loud) and\n2. if the fiancee had any sense or wisdom she would not have accepted the tattling as a task. \nBut \n3. she does NOT have sense or wisdom about that situation, and shouldn't be expected to, because she's too young AND too inexperienced, and\n4. her youth and inexperience is why OP was attracted to her in the first place.\n\nHE set up a power struggle between two young women and now he's mad his daughter is not treating her big sister--whoops, I mean stepmom to be--as an actual parent.\n\nThis whole thing is on him. He can use the camera as the babysitter/snitch in future instead of the fiancee.\n\n[Edited to add the Y T A and also tried to make it display the numbers as I wanted it to, unfruitfully]", "If you keep relegating your parenting duties to your fianc\u00e9e, you would just be constantly pitting them against each other.", "That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I think the word choice of \u201cconfronting\u201d/\u201ccalling her out\u201d is throwing people.", "The thing is, we only have the daughter's word that the fianc\u00e9e \"tried to punish her\". The same daughter who was \"only a few minutes late\". The only thing we know happened is that the fianc\u00e9e \"confronted her\" which might as well be saying \"you're in big trouble when your dad gets home\". Everybody here is talking as if the fianc\u00e9e grounded her for a week or smth when there's absolutely no indication that this happened.", "You are assuming the fianc\u00e9e has the daughter's number.  If they don't get along, there is a good chance that she doesn't. But even if she did have the daughter's number, I have a feeling that the fianc\u00e9e texting the daughter to check up on her wouldn't have had a good outcome, either. To the daughter, it probably would have felt like overstepping.  \n\nAnd, we have no idea if the fianc\u00e9e actually tried to punish the daughter, just that she confronted her which could have been something along the lines of \"Where have you been?  Do you know what time it is? You were supposed to be home two hours ago!\"  followed by a \"When your dad hears about this....\"  That could have easily set the daughter off because 1)   \n the fianc\u00e9e was checking up on her and questioning her, and 2) the fianc\u00e9e is going to tell on her so she is going to get in trouble.  The daughter bold-faced lied about how late she was, so I would question if anything she told her dad about that night was the truth or if it was a ploy to take the heat off her for breaking curfew and lying about it.", "I didn't read anywhere that fiance attempted any punishment, only confronted daughter about being late.  She definitely should have confronted her and told her I will inform your father.  This seems to be what occurred.  OP is nta.", "As I said upthread, we only have the word of the known liar for the punishment part, and \"confront\" could mean anything.", "(It keeps turning my 4 into another 3 and I don't know why, sorry)", "Confronting her was already a misstep. As would be a threat like \"you're in trouble when your dad gets home.\"\n\nShe should absolutely not have confronted her at all.\n\nThat is trying to parent out of place.\n\nEven saying \"you're in big trouble when your dad gets home\" would have been highly inappropriate. That's trying to threaten the girl with punishment using the father and any teenager is going to see through that and be offended by it.\n\nShe could have let the father talk to and punish the daughter appropriately without a confrontation. There was no scenario where a confrontation was going to go well at 1am when daughter had been out late and fiancee was stressed. The teenager yelling at her was a very predictable consequence of her choice to engage and escalated a situation that did not need to be escalated at that point. She had no actual authority to punish the daughter and both of them knew that. So any confrontation was merely creating a conflict. They already don\u2019t get along, it just reinforced the animosity for no reason. \n\nShe could have discreetly said something to the father and he could have then checked the cameras and talked to his daughter.\n\nShe's not the parent to a 17 year old and trying to pretend she is is only going to create further conflict. It's laughable given the ages of all involved. Daughter\u2019s likely not an idiot, her own father was out conceiving her when he was 17-18 and he\u2019s now leaving her alone with his much younger partner. Her own parents are interested in getting along well enough to co-parent effectively. The 26 year old stepping in at 1am to try to enforce a curfew was absolutely unnecessary and futile. What was she going to actually be able to do to daughter except say \u201cI\u2019m telling\u201d like an immature older sibling?  Daughter is at the age where she likely thinks the curfew is bullshit anyway. Everyone involved would have been better off if OP started by talking to his daughter about why the curfew is needed, whether she was safe, why she\u2019s acting out right now, etc. and then merited out punishment.\n\nNow they\u2019ve got a situation where the daughter thinks she is being punished for getting into it with the fianc\u00e9e who tried to inappropriately parent her and where that is being reinforced by daughter\u2019s mother. \n\nSo nothing was learned here by daughter expect that fianc\u00e9e is overstepping. Which means the animosity and lack of respect will only increase. \n\nAny attempt on the fianc\u00e9es part to talk to the daughter as though she has authority over daughter was a punishment in this case. She should have let the actual parents parent.\n\nShe likely doesn't know any better because she's 26 and therefore in no position to be parenting a teenager.

Start a conversation with the goal of building trust so that she stops lying to you and she can simply ask you for permission to stay out a little longer if she wants to.", "Well considering I pay a sitter to watch my child and she\u2019s only 5 years older than my ten year old, are you saying she\u2019s not allowed to say no games if he doesn\u2019t follow directions or do his homework? Age really isn\u2019t the factor here. His daughter is old enough to know better. She knew she would be in trouble. 17 year old is the AH.\nEdit for extra word", "Do you have any idea how many public school teachers are 22 or 23 and in charge of 18/19 year olds. This is a ridiculous argument. One is an adult and one is not.", "So the daughter can do whatever she wants when the dad isn't around, got it.", "This happened yesterday too, only the woman was 29 \ud83d\ude44", "Never said her fiance wasn't wrong for giving her directions", ">ianc\u00e9e was in the wrong for trying to enforce consequences/ \"confront\" daughter\n\nwhere did you see her trying to enforce consequences?? we have no clue what happened. You have all sorts of assumptions here. Calling her an ah is a stretch", "Her being 17 is immaterial. The daughter may not respect that she is an authority figure, but she is in that position. Saying she isn\u2019t does not render it untrue.", "An authority figure is whoever the parent says. That's why even a 13-year-old babysitter is an authority figure for the duration of their duties: because the parent has appointed them as such.\n\nWith that said, nobody can force a teen to *care* that somebody is an authority figure.", "Lol!! No, it\u2019s not. Once OP said to make sure she is home by curfew, it became her business. It is like a parent who leaves an overnight babysitter. That babysitter\u2019s role is to make sure the kids follow the rules set by the parents.", "Yes!!!!! This is what I\u2019m saying and you know the daughter did this on purpose to establish dominance because she knew dad wasn\u2019t home and it was just the finance and \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have to listen to her because that\u2019s not her mom\u201d. Fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t give the kid a curfew her dad did so she\u2019s really just disrespecting her dad", "[deleted]", "Your sitter is 15, which means you agree that 17 is old enough to not need a baby sitter. Fianc\u00e9 is not a step parent and should not be trying to parent someone who is essentially and adult. Op is out of line for delegating parental duties to someone so close to daughter\u2019s age.", "Yeah, but they don't already hate you because you are going to marry her very older dad, at least I hope. \nOp's daughter already hate this woman and instead of dealing with his daughter OP decided it was a good idea to outsource his parenting to her.", "Yeah but those teachers usually aren\u2019t fucking the students parents FYI.", "The curfew was 11. The daughter showed up at 1. Clearly, that is not a few minutes late.....", "Well he does say the finale was \"distraught\" the NEXT MORNING, which leads me to believe there was more than just a \"hey, you know I need to tell your dad about this\" type conversation with the daughter", "Exactly. Fianc\u00e9 was probably worried something bad happened, and mad she had to wait up til 1am to make sure the daughter got home safe. Just because she said something about it doesn\u2019t mean she was actually trying to punish her in that moment.", "The fiance has the number because the OP leaves her to parent a lot. Re-read the post.", "They'll never understand. No one is supposed to parent a child, EVER! at least according to reddit.", "I just think your missing the point", "Still missing it.", "So he shouldn't have gone to work? He's an ER nurse.\n\nFianc\u00e9 did not punish her. Just said I was worried about you, I am going to tell your father. She is a monster.\n\nMy point was age alone is not a reason to say she has no authority.", "We can at least hope...", "Being almost an adult or being an adult wouldn't matter, the owner of the house/actual authority figure set a rule that was intentionally broken due to pettiness and/or misguided anger.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 didn't deserve that disrespect for being there, OP didn't deserve the disrespect for not being there.", "You sound like a child and good luck for the 18 year old supporting themselves fully in this economy or pursuing higher ed.", "Which is perfectly fine, when she's old enough to move into her own place, she can set her own rules with the expectation that people in her residence won't break those rules, until then she is expected to follow the rules set forth by her father regardless of whose home.", "I'm confused, who said the 26 year old was an infant? I know I certainly didn't.", "And it really doesn\u2019t sound like much parenting even happened, she simply confronted her about violating curfew and the daughter went off on her.", "[deleted]", "Op is an idiot for leaving his girlfriend in some mythical position of power and then acting shocked when his daughter didn't play along in that fantasy. She is almost an adult. His fiance is nothing to her, not a parent, not a guardian, no one she has to listen to in any situation. It'd be like leaving a \"baby sitter\" in charge of a 17 year old. Its nonsense. And his daughter reacted the way most 17 year olds would. By putting the fake parent back in their \"you're just my dad's girlfriend STFU\" lane.", "I stand by both comments I made.", "You don\u2019t have to be a parent to confront the daughter. What the fianc\u00e9 did is no different than what a teacher, coach, work supervisor, school administrator, etc might do with someone who steps out of line. The fact that he isn\u2019t the parent is immaterial.", ">Op is an idiot for leaving his girlfriend in some mythical position of power \n\nJudging by the information given, OP didn't expect his fiance to do anything other than let him know she made curfew. \n\n>then acting shocked when his daughter didn't play along in that fantasy.\n\nThe shock came from the daughter breaking a rule she had never broken before, the only thing different this time was that he wasn't home. \n\n>She is almost an adult.\n\nShe's acting like a child. \n\n>His fiance is nothing to her, not a parent, not a guardian, no one she has to listen to in any situation. \n\nShe is the future wife of her father, her future step mother and potential future mother to her future half siblings, daughter doesn't have to obey fiance but she needs to accept that she's marrying her father. Harboring that resentment is unhealthy.\n\n>It'd be like leaving a \"baby sitter\" in charge of a 17 year old. Its nonsense.\n\nBad example, unless you're trying to prove my point. \n\nYou would still be in the right to punish the 17 year old for disobeying a babysitter you gave authority to, again the age isn't ther issue here, it's the blatant breaking of a rule set by OP.\n\n> Its nonsense. And his daughter reacted the way most 17 year olds would. By putting the fake parent back in their \"you're just my dad's girlfriend STFU\" lane.\n\nI suppose that is what I expect a child with built up resentment towards their step mom,  fueled by a resentful (jealous?)bio mom, to react. As a child would, which kind of renders your ,\"almost an adult\", argument null and void. \n\nYour comments appear to come from an emotional place, I don't know if you had a bad step parent or are too young to have regrets about shit you did as a teenager but there's a bias there that doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon,  if it's the latter, you'll figure it out eventually. If it's the former, I'll quote something I mentioned earlier. \n\n>Harboring that resentment is unhealthy.", "Not the person you were responding to but I'm a bit confused by your comments, so I'm just trying to clarify that you use a 15 year old to baby sit your 10 year old because a 15 year is old enough to baby sit, but you are also saying that OP's daughter a 17 year old needs a babysitter?"]}
