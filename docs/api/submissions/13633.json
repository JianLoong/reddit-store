Why continue with the arrangement if you are not being respected?", "NTA. If your boyfriend is going to be pushy and make huge decisions without talking to you about it, I\u2019d think really hard about the long term and if this is a relationship you want to pursue.", "NTA but you are incredibly naive to have agreed with this set up. Time to move and lose the bf.", "NTA.  Where are her parents?  If you are the guardians, then the parents owe you child support.   She's still a minor.  She lives with mom, or dad, or someone owes child support...", "NTA you don\u2019t need to split the bills you need to split from them", "NTA\n\nHis sister is entitled and he's indulging her. Are you really happy in a relationship with a man who moves his sister in without your consent and now expects you to provide for her?", "NTA. Stick to your guns.\n\nYour bf has a ton of audacity to force you to live with someone you don't want to live with, but to also insinuate you need to financially care for her as well is delusional.\n\nThe fact that he said her living with you is \"non-negotiable\" is messed up in itself. You should be included in that decision as someone who also pays rent. I'd tell him HE needs to pay for her expenses, and that you will never be the one to do so. \n\nIf he pushes on the matter, I'd suggest either moving out yourself or overriding his \"non-negotiable\" decision, and kick her out. Because wtf. They are both taking advantage of you. Don't let them treat you like a doormat.", "NTA for expecting her to pay, but kind of for dating this guy.  What on earth does be bring to the table? Sorry, sis has to go - she may not be able to live there if she is not on the lease,  especially with her record.", "NTA but you just signed a new lease.

I would of moved out right then.\n\n\nSo his sister is 17 and already a felon.\n\n>She has a felony and continues to want to do the things that got her in that situation.\n\n And stealing your things ..\n\n>She\u2019s a high school drop out with no job who takes all of my belongings without permission.\n\n  If she isn't going to school or getting the GED, she needs to work. If she doesn't want to work she can go back to her parents. \n\n  Or you can dump both of them..\n\n And I wouldn't of lined up a job with your family for him.", "NTA. If it doesn't change.  1st choice Rehome your BF and his little sister. 2nd choice If she dropped out of school, then she should be working. BF wants her there, then he needs to find a way to support her. You shouldn't be paying for either.", "NTA\n\nYikes. Why are you still dating him?", "NTA\nHis sister needs to take responsibility for herself, not pampering.", "NTA - Are you adopting her?? Or is he just using you to take care of her?", "I might come across as a bit unsympathetic here, but come on! He got a job through you - why did he need you to get him a job? He over-rode your objection to his felon sister living with you both. He expects you to support her in her quest to do sweet FA all day, every day, while she tries to earn herself a new felony charge. She steals your belongings and in return you cook and clean for her.\n\n\nYou have already solely supported your bf throughout 2023 and he wants payback for covering you for 1 month of living costs. Now he's angry that you won't support his family member indefinitely (probably until she ends up incarcerated). Don't forget that chances are lawyers fees will likely need to be budgeted for, if your description of the sister is an accurate one. \n\n\nOP you are 21 years old. You are not responsible for, anyone but yourself and this is a time in your life you won't get back. Don't waste your 20's on this guy and his sister. NTA for not wanting to live the life your boyfriend is trying to foist onto you. Get out, don't look back and go be 21!", "NTA, and it sounds like she shouldnt be living with you at all.  it also sounds like your BF is attempting to sponge off you for both himself and for her. this is not the time to give in, as it will set the president that the princess gets whatever she wants.", "NTA. She is not your responsibility. I\u2019d suggest for her to find a job since she\u2019s not going to school or to move back home with her parents if that\u2019s possible. It is unfair and selfish for your boyfriend to expect you to cover her costs after you told him you weren\u2019t comfortable with her moving in. I wish you luck though!", "Not your responsibility to pay for the sister.  Or the BF for that matter.  This is a recipe for disaster.", "NTA, but you REALLY need to reconsider this relationship because having him say it's non negotiable for her to live there and expect you to pay for her rent while also being her maid is just all sorts of wrong.", "NTA if your boyfriend didn't make his expectations clear about paying her share of the rent and bills before you signed up.  You clearly had different ideas about how this set up was going to work and it's hard to say if that's down to a lack of communication between the two of you or whether he was deliberately being deceptive in order to get you to sign the lease.  Either way, I don't think it's reasonable that you should be paying anything towards her share.  It might be different if you were a married couple, but you're not. You didn't even want her there.", "NTA but you need to decide if your relationship is worth doing so or not. If you feel so strongly about not doing so then take that stance, but be prepared for whatever his reaction may be.", "You: NTA.\n\nYour BF & his sister: TA & leeches.\n\nThe \"little sister\"may end up getting you in trouble. She's bad news. Your BF had no right to impose you such a responsibility. You're barely an adult yourself. Maybe you can't legally split rent in three, but since demon sister being in your house is non negotiable, tell your BF that she needs to get a job,, pay for her own groceries & stuff and at least clean after herself. And that's non negotiable either.\n\nAnyway, I think you're buying a problem  with those two. Run before it's too late.", "You've moved from a toxic waste to a cesspool.

NTA.", "Move out. NTA", "NTA. Having to be financially responsible for 3 people at 21 is exhausting and really shouldn't be your responsibility as you're not her parent. If she's refusing to work work or contribute, you'll have to decide if this relationship is worth whatever headache she will bring, but you don't owe anything to his sister just because you're dating him.", "NTA.\n\nKick them both out. They are both trying to sponge off of you.", "ESH except maybe your boyfriend.\n\nYour boyfriend made it clear that it was a non-negotiable for him when it came to her paying rent. I don't know why you thought that would change after she moved in when he was clear on that from the start. You signed a new lease *knowing* this.\n\nHis sister needs to grow up and figure out what she's doing in her life. She's young so she has time but it's on her to make that choice now.\n\nYour boyfriend possibly an asshole for letting his sister take advantage of the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may not be allowed to have a permanent resident or long term guest. It could either be you moving out or little sister moving out. I would not live with her.", "NTA it is not your job to financially support his sister.", "NTA but stop everything you\u2019re doing for her and when the lease is up move out.", "NTA you really need to be careful where you are paying out a lot more than a partner, then they start bringing relatives or even friends and expecting you to fund them too, then making out that you are in the wrong and not only not backing down, but giving you absolutely no choice in the matter. It is like they only really care for their own and you're just a means to an end.", "NTA. I would tell him either she gets a job, he pays for her food etc or she moves out. Like, this is relationship breaking level issues.", "NTA but what did you think would happen when she moved in? She has no job and is a minor. You had to find your boyfriend a job. Sorry but they both sound like losers and you didn\u2019t think this situation through before agreeing to it. Actually none of you seem mature enough to be living on your own.", "Esh. You never should have moved in and signed a lease unless that was all decided to everyone's satisfaction. You have caused yourself a ton of headaches here.\n\nYour bf is ridiculous to expect you to support his sister. He's right that 17 year olds shouldn't be paying rent but he is missing the fact that it is supposed to be their parents or guardians that provide for them - not their sibling's SO. Where are her parents?", "NTA - If he is insisting on her being there then HE pays her portion of everything. That includes HIM financing anything that isn't a normal standard household grocery.\n\nI would also buy a locker and a lock and lock up everything you own since she keeps taking without permission. Or tell him straight out that if he cant control her then you are out. It's one thing to do standard cleanup and cooking for an extra person but you are neither an ATM nor a willing victim of theft. NO means no. If he cant control her, she needs to go and it is on him to be the one to explain that and to back up his words.", "You need to lose both of those deadbeats", "NTA. Not your kid.

You\u2019re still NTA but just contractually, you owe what you signed up for. On a positive note, your bf owes half too, so unless you said the prior months you covered were a gift, he owes you back for those.\n\nYou could pursue having the sister removed and see if the landlord is willing to help end the lease early based on the breach of terms. I don\u2019t see another way for you to get out of it. Sorry.", "I have questions about her situation that could affect you. Is she emancipated? She is currently underage you said right? Does your BF (her brother) have any legal right to guardianship?\nAt 17 with a felony she more likely than not has a PO, are you sure she hasn't violated any of her probation or parole stipulations during this move?\nThese are things that could potentially deeply affect you. Depending on the situation, they could adversely legally affect you.", "It is over.", "It was over when he said \u201cnon negotiable \u201c. She is not your child.  And if he keeps coddling her she isn\u2019t going to grow up.", "See, here is the problem.  What if you said it was non-negotiable for her to move in, essentially making him choose between you and her?  He chose her.  You had the choice between them (package deal) and yourself and you choose them.  Stop putting yourself last.  \n\nHe owes you not only basic respect and care, but his livelihood.  And he is showing you entitlement.  Try to get out of the lease by alerting your landlord to her presence in the apartment.", ">However, when he asked her to move in i told him i wasn\u2019t comfortable with that and he said it was non negotiable. While she shouldn\u2019t have to pay rent.\n\nThen I'm confused by this part. I assumed this was at typo for him saying she shouldn't have to pay rent. What did you meant by \"While she shouldn't have to pay rent.\"?", "This is the way", ">So then you probably owe half, contractually.\n\nContractually - for most/many rental contracts - the responsibility is joint and severable: in that the landlord can hold OP or BF responsible for the rent - whoever is more likely to be able to pay.\n\nWhether OP can recover anything from BF will depend on what documented agreements they have between them and whether they want to go to court to enforce them."]}
