Please be careful and look out for yourself. We don't have a lot of information but from what we have it does not sound like a healthy and supportive environment for you.", "NTA\n\nOf course she should pay, but let\u2019s face it, she ain\u2019t gonna get a job, or pay or help now or ever.\n\nMy real concern here is you \u201cspending every dime\u201d you have on these people. Your boyfriend is a big boi, he can find a job himself, you don\u2019t have to financially support him or find him a job. These people are taking advantage of you, what is the benefit out if this arrangement for you? \n\nYou can\u2019t expect apples from the maple tree. These people are irresponsible and your love won\u2019t change deeply rooted in accountability and entitlement patterns. Sorry. You are very young and you are setting yourself for failure here.", "ESH\nSister needs to get off her ass and support herself. \nBoyfriend is delusional thinking anyone should have to support a fully capable person and then has the audacity and entitlement to get angry when you said no. \nOp for even entertaining this sort of living situation. \nOp pay your third and look for a new place. They are going to bleed you dry and then get angry when you have nothing left to give. \n\nPut your foot down now. This is unacceptable.", "Your way to young to be dealing with this drama with a boyfriend. Just leave him and start new. Yiur not marries to him. This isn't a future you want nor one yiu deserve. Let him support him and his sister and see how he likes it...don't do this to yourself. He isn't worth it", "He's not naive. He's a user.", "Your boyfriend made it clear that paying his rent was non-negotiable for him. I don't know why you thought he would change after entering when he was clear about it from the beginning. You signed a new lease knowing this.", "Agree. He clearly is using her. I can't imagine being so desperate for a man to put up with this. Sad.", "her parents are still allowing her to live there. but her parents have substance abuse issues. so she wanted to be here.", "Comment stealing bot", "Then you kick her out. HE can pay for her but your not. Stop cleaning up after her. Put cameras up in the kitchen and living room for your safety.", "You don't need to kick her out, just stop providing for her. If he wants to take responsibility for his 17yo high school dropout of a sister with no job then \\*he\\* can take care of her both financially and by cooking for and cleaning up after her.\n\nYou are not her mom.", "You can break up with him and be just the roommate.", "Tell the LL your bf has someone unapproved living there that's not on the lease. Maybe the LL can evict her? Idk.", "Then you kick her out. Refer to the section of your lease that details how long guests can stay. Show him you are in violation of your lease if she stays and you don\u2019t want to risk losing the apartment. I guarantee you somewhere in your lease it says something like guests can\u2019t stay for more than 3 weeks in any given month.", "Tell landlord she is not on the lease landlord will deal with it", "The cops will. He cannot move someone in without your permission. Unless he's her legal guardian.", "Yours and his is on the lease, not hers.. Take it to your landlord if you have to. You didn't agree to her living with you. He broke the lease by having her move in", "Well, you don't anymore and now you are her mom. Be smarter, leave now.", "But you have a bad one since ONE year ago.", "Your post history tells quite the story.  First relationship, toxic man, you asking if fights that are horrible are normal????\n\nGirl, you just refused to see the red flags.", "Are you sure? I know in New York that immediate family members are allowed to live in the apartment without being on the lease. I think only one person though.", "I see so much of that here....I swear if I read \"my partner has no job and plays video games all day/night, what did I do wrong\" I swear my head will explode. WHY???", "And that is fine - but it is still her parents responsibility to pay for her upkeep.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, she might not be allowed to stay.", "our landlord do know she\u2019s staying here.", " I know in New York that immediate family members are allowed to live in the apartment without being on the lease.", "She's a minor so legally, they might not be able to put her on the lease anyway.\n\nBest advice - stop buying her anything.  Divide all utilities up into 3rds and BF gets to pay 2/3 since he invited her and insists she stays.  Keep your money separate from his and do NOT allow him access to your accounts or credit cards.  Consider getting a PO Box and having your mail sent there so neither of them can \"accidently\" get a credit card in your name.  Put a lock on your closet, your drawers and your bedroom door.  Consider installing cameras and tell both of them if she \"borrows\" anything else of yours, you will take the footage to the police and file theft charges against her.\n\nYou do not have to be passive here nor do you have to take what he is dishing out.  He doesn't like it, tell him to  either kick out sister or the two of them are free to leave.  \n\nSister is a mooch and BF is an enabler.  You need tostart doing whatever you can to break the lease and move away from them.  This will not end well for you otherwise \n\nYou are NTA and thank goodness you are seeing these red flags", "our landlord knows she lives here", "Not just his sisters mom, he\u2019s trying to put her in a parental role with him.  He wants her to finance him as well as his sister, and she does the bulk of looking after the flat and cooking. He\u2019s not worth her time. He\u2019s altogether icky and should be her ex soon hopefully.", "she\u2019s no emancipated and we do not have legal custody. And yes, she is 17. Her PO is her mother since she is on \u201cvoluntary probation\u201d but her mother is involved in the same activities that led to this situation. in fact, i don\u2019t even think she told the courts we moved. I am terrified they will effect me. and he\u2019s worried about it too. but he doesn\u2019t know how else to make her stop", "you\u2019re absolutely right but they blow all their money on booze", "i mean as a 17 year old you shouldn\u2019t have that financial responsibility. BUT she\u2019s not being forced to be here , so she made it her responsibility", "The way out of this mess is NOT renewing your lease and get out. And by get out, I mean RUN. He ain\u2019t no prince", "Break up with him and take the hit on the lease. These losers are not worth it at all. You can do better I\u2019m sure", "You are worth more. You can do better. You can and will be happy in a relationship. This is not it", "Exactly. She is in to be financially abused and more.", "I was referring to what Op can pursue in small claims, rather than what the landlord can pursue but you are also correct.", "Not even money wise but she's old enough to make her own meals and clean up after herself.\n\nI would argue that it's reasonable he doesn't want to make her pay since she *is* still a minor. That's his choice. If that doesn't work for you it likely speaks to a bigger divide with how you see family responsibilities and may be compatibility issue."]}
