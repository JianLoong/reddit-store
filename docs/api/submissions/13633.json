You have no obligation to take care of her in any way. That is all on him or his parents. They should pay 2/3 rent plus 2/3 utilities, groceries and cover her daily essentials. \n\nNTA", "\"However, when he asked her to move in i told him i wasn\u2019t comfortable with that and he said it was non negotiable.\"\n\nConsequences . You were not comfortable with this idea of living with the sister, but you choose to do it anyway. Be honest and tell him you made a mistake and don't want to live with this sister.", "If you have low standards, keep the boyfriend, and probably he will be unemployed soon or raise your standards and find a hard-working, dependable, caring man.", "Girl, you're 21. Dump him and move on. NTA", "NTA-Break up with them!", "NTA please get out of that situation.", "Yessss. OP: dump him and his sister.", "I can't for the life of me understand why OP moved in with this asshole to begin with. But it's time to find new living arrangements. And a new boyfriend.", "she\u2019s on probation. \u201cvoluntary probation\u201d. she\u2019s not a convicted felon, but nonetheless she\u2019s still a felon.", "I bend over backwards for good people. So i\u2019m sure he thought i would. Their parents are unfortunately addicts. Him and I both laid down terms but she refuses to listen. We\u2019ve tried punishing her, talking to her, grounding her and yelling at her but she just does not care. Our lease ends in like 11 more months. She\u2019s supposed to be getting her GED online but has 2 months left and is less than 10% done. She wants to go to trade school but she will not put effort in to get there.", "to be fair she\u2019s been lying to him for the past 4 months saying she was doing school", "he knows i don\u2019t want to live with the sister. at this point i don\u2019t think he WANTS to live with his sister. But at this point her only options are the streets, a trap house or with us. So i genuinely do understand why he made it non negotiable. But since i told him no from the jump, i\u2019m pretty firm on the im not paying her costs of living.", "Why on earth would you sign a lease with someone who insisted on moving in a deadbeat who steals your stuff?", "Move out the second the lease ends and say goodbye to them both.", "Then he didn't ask. See if you can get off the lease because your boyfriend is letting a felon live there who is not on the lease. He can't tell you something is non-negotiable without you being able to say the same.", "why are you with a guy who keeps trying to get you to pay for himself and his sister? Now that he is working after being unemployed and supported by you for 3 months, HE is the one that should be picking up the tabs! You are 21 and still very young, don't tie yourself down with a dude who doesn't appreciate you or respect you.", "Do you think that it will ever be back to that? Is the sister the entire problem, or is it how your boyfriend is handling things?", "I was keeping an open mind until I read this. She\u2019s a kid raised by substance abusers who got herself in bad trouble young. I\u2019d like to hear that she\u2019s trying to restart,but it seems like she\u2019s *not* trying at all. She probably needs help,but it\u2019s not something YOU are qualified for. She AND her enabling (maybe well meaning,but enabling) brother are just going to drag you down. You need to GTFO,lease hit or no lease hit. This situation is quicksand and you are too young to get buried.", "Look, you are young. You don\u2019t see the real person you are seeing until after a few years, and it is difficult to hide after a while living together.\n\nYou are being taken for granted, it will never get better, you are already having huge arguments, and his parents and sisters have severe issues. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this happen so often. Don\u2019t stick with this and find out the hard way. It will just get worse and worse until you become a shell of yourself.\n\nNothing in all your stories here is good.", "Well then, he should be addressing that and not rewarding her with paid rent.  That is his sister, and he may want to accept her poor behavior, but this is not going to resolves itself.  She is not being held accountable, so she is going to keep doing it and he is going to keep expecting you to pay for her.  I mean, you go him a job, you help pay his way but now he wants more - he wants you to pay her way.  He sounds like someone looking for an ATM to supplement his lifestyle choices and his sisters as well.", "If she's on the lease, she will still be responsible for rent though.", "I\u2019ve had my fair share of awful roommates and got stuck on the lease until it was over.. I suggest a camera for your room.. small and hidden so if she does steal you\u2019ll have proof.. she seems way to shady to not take precautions.. lock up valuables also..", "And lock your stuff up so she can't get to it.", "to be fair she was supposed to get a job before we moved. and the stealing didn\u2019t start till after either. I\u2019m assuming because now she has her own room", "I mean, technically her family is supporting him too since his job is with them. Maybe he is really great at it but nepo jobs don't always work out. And if OP's parents have to fire him and she is then the only one working... this isn't a situation that will end well. OP needs to get out of this mess while everyone grows up a little.", "i think the sister is the problem. i think she adds to much stress. i think she makes him and i so angry and then we end up bickering with each other. we both acknowledge that she\u2019s bad af. and neither one of us know what to do. i get that she\u2019s his sister and he doesn\u2019t want her on the streets. it\u2019s just a messy situation but we were SO good before it. We\u2019d even go hang out with his sister! but living with her has been rough. Ultimately though, i think if she isn\u2019t around forever we will go back to normal", "... is the way", "Just fyi, I got out of a lease by having a therapist send a letter stating the change in living situation (having someone else move in) negatively affected my health. You may have similar luck, but no matter what, don't stay with this tool.", "Tell the landlord, the relationship is over and you need to leave. Quickly.", "Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make an issue out of it.", "Agree that you should just a hit on the lease.  It will be way cheaper than the costs that are coming down the road.  I don't know how feasible it is for you to find another place to live but this situation will beat. you. down.  \n\nDon't let that happen.", "I guess I'd wonder how good things were before, and if I really see him the same. You're both on the lease, but he overrode you and moved his sister in. The way he's treating you under stress still results in you being hurt, and there are going to be things more stressful in your life than a 17 year old roommate. Also, did he lose the job with your parents? From an outside perspective, your boyfriend is causing the sister problem, or at least leaving it for you to deal with.", "he asked after he told her she could. i said no when he asked. but he said it wasn\u2019t negotiable", "At 21 men ain't usually ain't shit. OP, raise your standards and expectations from relationships. You'll find love again, and be more at peace.", "He does treat me poorly under stress and he knows it and acknowledges it and he does feel bad about it. i don\u2019t doubt that. We\u2019re in the process of trying to find therapy for him. He didn\u2019t lose the job with my parents, it\u2019s his third week", "So you just let him tell you what to do? Seriously this is not your circus if you can find a way to break lease try and get out.", "Get yourself some therapy too. You need to figure out why you don\u2019t have enough self-respect to get out of this mess. One minute you say he\u2019s perfect, then you say he treats you poorly under stress. Those two statements cannot coexist.\n\nThis is your first relationship, according to your post history. You are NOT in a good one. You said no to his sister moving in; he overrides your no. He expects you to pay half of everything. You have to cook for and clean up after her.\n\nIf you don\u2019t value yourself, you might as well be wearing a neon sign that says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine to treat me like crap,\u201d because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. You are worth so much more than what you\u2019re getting from this situation. Cut your chains and fly free."]}
