Tell him she needs to take your place on the lease so that you can move out. \n\nThis is a big red flag, the situation screams of him not respecting you and trying to take advantage of you.\n\nAlso, get tell your parents what's going on. Hopefully they can help you.", "Then report her as being there if she's not supposed to be a person on the lease. If she's on the lease then request to transition to a different unit. Your boyfriend would have stayed jobless way longer if you hadn't gotten him a job with his parents. How is he at work? Have you checked on him about it yet?", "If her name isn\u2019t on the lease you can report her to the landlord for official eviction I believe. Maybe not since she\u2019s a minor?", "I highly doubt this.  It seems more like you didn't know what an ass you were dealing with up to this point.  Wise up because he sounds like he's digging in so this is not going to change.", "You may need to have a good think about if you're in love with him or in love with who he used to be/ the idea of what you want him to be. He's using you and so is his sister.", "Fuck all, so jackshit", "He is going to continue to get more abusive, and you can be held legally responsible for what happens in the place because you're a leaseholder. Leave and go stay with family, ask your family with help getting a consultation with a lawyer to get out of the lease, and never talk to bf or his family again.", "Yeah. You should still only pay a third of everything, and let it up to him to support his sister.", "This makes the most sense to me. Go to management and tell them he has allowed someone to move in who isn\u2019t on the lease. (Than go to your parents and tell them to replace your boyfriend from the company roster. But I\u2019m terribly petty).", "You need to get her out. If she's doing illegal things and it comes back to your place, does illegal things in your clothing/with your items... yeah no. Your bf can't make her stop anything. \n\nSource: a woman who was once an 18 yo drug addict and was also a felon at 18.", "Not your problem unless you continue to let it be", "Yeah, depending on the type of landlord, they generally help the good tenant get the wastes of soace out if they can.", "NTA.  Get yourself a new place to live and a new boyfriend.", "NTA. Unfortunately I think you need to reevaluate your situation. You are being used and have become a doormat, a parent, a maid and an ATM. \n\nUntil his situation changes with his sister and she\u2019s old enough to be on her own and off in her own apartment, you should probably think about having your boyfriend get his own apartment for himself and his sister. I feel if you don\u2019t do this soon, your relationship with them wil become more volatile. \n\nThere are so many red flags \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 here. You guys aren\u2019t married, but he\u2019s suddenly making all the rules and telling you things are \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d? What\u2019s that about? \n\nYou are only 21. Are you really ready to take on the full responsibility of a teenager who doesn\u2019t feel like she needs to contribute to anything? She\u2019s not going to school. Felony or not she needs to get a job and help to pay her share. Period.", "NTA and sweetie you need to get the heck out. You are just 21. IMO way to young to be living with a guy for a year. And def way to young to be taking care of his sister.  I am guessing their parents are not in the picture ?  How does she have a felony at that age? Why isn\u2019t she is in jail?\nYes 21 is an \u201cadult\u201d. But I was still pretty stupid at that age as are a lot of 21 yo. Get support from your family and get out", "Get out of this relationship. That\u2019s what you really need to hear. Not if this is an AH situation", "NTA, see if your landlord will let you break the lease. If you can't afford to pay the penalty to break the lease, see if your parents will give you a loan to help you move out and get a better living situation; they seem pretty supportive, getting your bf a job and such. Better to be in debt to your parents than owe any more rent with your bf. You should cut your losses now, the longer you stay, the bigger the hole in your pocket will be. Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy!", "NTA but YIKES! You\u2019re being used, time to move out on your own.", "NTA and lock up you IDENTITY", "Ok if he believes she\u2019s 17 and can\u2019t pay so he pays 2/3. \nNTA", "NTA what did I even just read.", "Time to move .", "ESH, it sounds like you all deserve each other.", "Move out. Let him take care of his dead-beat sister.", "Run while you still can.", "NTA. \n\nThis child is a felon at 17?!\n\nIf your boyfriend and sister come as a package deal, I'd seriously re-evaluate this relationship. It doesn't sound like she is going to change any time soon, and certainly not with you and your boyfriend doing everything for her and buying her vapes and other stuff.", "NTA.  She's his drop-out felon of a sister.  She's contributing nothing to the household.  If he wants to allow her to live with you, she needs to be paying 1/3 of everything.  It would be different if she was going to school and saving money to go to college.  Then I'd say that she shouldn't be expected to pay but could help with chores.  There's no excuse for him to give her a free ride.  If you're going to continue to live with your bf, you need to purchase a safe for your valuables.  Don't give bf the combination.\n\nIf he refuses to make her pay her own way, then he needs to pay for her.  You don't owe either of them anything.", "NTA. Girl Run. This is not the life for you.", "You are not the asshole she is she should either go to school or get a job or move out if she wants to live there of and stop stealing shit as well you should talk to your bf about it bc you shouldn't have to deal with that", "NTA but RUN", "Nta. Red flags everywhere. Please reassess the relationship", "NTA - this sounds like a nightmare situation and I hope you get out of it, live on your own and enjoy your freedom.", "You need a new BF and they need to move out.", "You should not clean for her, but she should clean the place if she can\u2019t pay. Clean, cook, laundry, etc. Non-negotiable. Don\u2019t buy her vapes & snacks, because she has no reason to work then; she gets it from you for free!", "Break your lease and get the hell out of there.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nLook, if she was in school, and helped with chores then yes, you would be in the wrong but it's also still not your responsibility either.\n\nBut. She is not in school, not working, not doing anything. NTA. She needs to step up or step out. Sorry. No.", "Bingo! OP Please learn from our hard lessons. This situation won\u2019t get any better. Go take care of yourself. Let (ex)BF get his shizzle together and you can re-visit a relationship if & when that happens.", "So then OP ends up supporting the deadbeat BF and the sister. \n\nOP is NTA but could be in a lose/lose situation. There could be a tenant advocacy group offering legal advice. I would recommend looking into that. \n\nAs soon as OP is able to they should run and let these two destroy themselves.", "Notify the landlord if another party not on the lease is taking up residence. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have something to say about it.", "Tell the landlord that BF, and NOT you, brought someone else to the apartment and you want out but don't want to be penalized.", "He was making you pay for him, moved her in when you told her no, and is massively disrespectful. The sister is not the issue, he is. DTMFA.", "You are very young. Break the lease and get out. Explain the situation to your landlord. Your partner is being manipulative and financially abusive. Get out, it will get worse. Do not waste your youth on this loser. DTMFA", "All this", "No, don't. Get out. This guy and his sis are not in good working order. You are young and be single. Find joy.", "Bf can pay 2/3s if the rent if not - dump his ass.", "OP, dump him. You are too young for this nonsense. This is not a healthy relationship, relationships should make you happy. When you're this young, it's not about struggling or working through things. He's actively making your life worse. Get out. Break the lease if you must. It is *far* better than the alternative.", "The way is this", "This is unacceptable at any age, but rn you are too young for this BS. Do you want the rest of your life like this? Get out, who knows maybe he'll mature and you'll get back together, but if he can't deal with stress without getting emotionally abusive he's in poor working order. Enjoy your youth.", "Move", "NTA.\n\nFrom the sounds of it you have two kids you\u2019re raising. It may be nonnegotiable to him but it can also be nonnegotiable to you as well.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I feel like YWBTA if you worked on enabling that behavior.  Girl needs to learn to be an adult and that doesn't sound like it's happening.", "You must leave this situation NOW!!!!", "Find a subletter for your part of the lease and get the hell out of this relationship and this situation. He clearly doesn't respect you and is just trying to use you for money, cooking, cleaning, groceries, etc", "Leave your boyfriend", "NTA. I went through and saw your previous posts about him, and I\u2019m honestly worried for you - this is abusive behavior, and I know he has only been doing it recently, but many people have said that before being assaulted or unalived. \n\nPlease, please, please do yourself a favor and get out while you can.", "What reason does he give for imposing her support on you?\n\nHave you given any thought to how quickly your boyfriend and his sister are looking to you to cover costs?", "I don\u2019t even understand why you\u2019re putting up with the situation to begin with. If he wants to pay for his sister, that\u2019s fine. Either you should move out, or have them move out. He can take care of her himself. It\u2019s not your responsibility. NTA", "NTA dump them both", "Red flags!! walk away from both of them", "NTA, would be different if she was in school but she isnt so she should be contributing or get out.   Or OP should get out of that situation and let bro/sis be alone together.", "Nta. Move out. You don't need to live in this situation.", "Leave that terrible man and his shitty sister immediately. When you wrote this, I didn\u2019t immediately register that he is enabling his terrible sister while using you?\nNTA", "NTA. dump him.", "Why are you dating this loser?", "Get out", "Oh hun, you\u2019re far too young to be raising someone who is nearly your age. \n\nNta but your Bf is and you should rethink your living situation.", "For real. NTA OP, but run before you get any deeper", "Somehow I read that as, \"He not a keeper, he is an user!\"", "And carry all your credit cards and money with you at all times. Get a PO Box for mail,t oo."]}
