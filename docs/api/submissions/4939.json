Before I moved out, my living situation wasn\u2019t great. I was raised by my grandmother due to both my bio parents having issues with drugs and mental stuff when I was first born. My dad with my younger siblings moved in with us a couple of years back due to them being evicted from their last home. My grandmother was supposed to have retired by now, but was unable to due to having to care for more people. She and my dad would constantly argue due to him refusing to get a job and move out, or him usually leaving her to watch and provide for his kids while he left for days or even weeks to who knows where, as well as him encouraging my younger siblings to do things like skip school, vape, etc.  He also constantly leeched and asked to \u201cborrow money\u201d not just from my grandmother but me and my younger siblings. Money he never paid back 95% of the time. If I refused or tried to say no he would get angry or say stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything\u201d because there were times I asked him to drive me places when I was younger. You know, things most parents do for their kids without expecting something in return. There\u2019s other things he does too but I won\u2019t list them all. \n\nI wanted to be close to him at a younger age because he had been gone a lot for my early childhood. But after seeing the way he treated his own family and hearing screwed up things he did, I started to distance myself from all of them. When I moved out, I kept my plans private and didn\u2019t give them my address, by saying I was just staying with a friend for a while because I really didn\u2019t want that toxicity to follow me to my new start. Not for a while at least.\n\nAt some point recently, my grandmother finally had enough and forced him out, telling him to take his kids too or she would call CPS. Some of you might think she was in the wrong for this, but again he had been leeching on her and living rent free for two years off her, and had the nerve to constantly insult her when she didn\u2019t want to live with his crap. It wasn\u2019t her responsibility to take care of more grand kids just because he thought because he did it with the first one, so why not the others? \n\nA few days back I got a call from the youngest who told me what happened and said my dad wanted to know where I was. I didn\u2019t want to say and he picked up and got mad, calling me ungrateful and a brat and other terms I don\u2019t want to put. Even if I had enough space which I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t mentally handle any of them right now. I blocked and I haven\u2019t heard from them personally since, only that they\u2019re now staying with an aunt. I spent so long wanting and planning to get away from that hellhole, there was no way I wanted to let it follow me because \u201ciTs fAmiLy\u201d. But I have gotten mixed responses from my friends who say I should have at least tried.

They obviously just don\u2019t get it, not a single clue.\n\nKeep with the no contact, and if they somehow show up at your door, call the police.", "NTA. Your roommate and your lease are your trump card. Legally, visitor clause aside, the persons named on the lease are the only ones allowed to inhabit the apartment. Strike 1 for dad. Second, your roommate should be allowed to approve or veto your guests staying overnight at your apartment (you would be allowed the same courtesy). Strike 2. Finally, dad sounds like a real peach who never amounted to much besides being an absent parent and a first class mooch. Strike 3.", "Omg, NTA!!! Sweetie you\u2019re establishing yourself as an independent responsible adult. Nothing is more important than that. No one who loves you would try to steal the beautiful thunder of this moment of your life \u2014 love yourself better and don\u2019t let them! Keep protecting yourself, growing and thriving! Leave those dysfunctional home dynamics in your dust.", "NTA just because you have biology tying you to someone does not mean that you should allow them to walk on you to use you to abuse yourself or others. You are very smart to go low contact or no contact with this parent. If you wish to you might have an email set up so siblings can update you of their life plans. But do let everyone know they are not to come to your place you are not going to give that information out and if they press you or hand the phone over to your parent that you will block them. I'm very happy that your grandmother raised you properly to make sure to take care of yourself. And I applaud your grandmother for standing up for herself and reclaiming her home. Whether one is related or not being used and abused is not acceptable. You are not alone. You are not the only person raised by their grandparents. You are not the only person who has toxic families members. I love this quote friends are the family you get to pick. Please keep yourself surrounded with healthy stable supportive individuals. Do not forget that mental health professionals can help you repair some of the side effects left over from toxic family members. I highly encourage you to do that. Because it will make it easier for you to stand up for yourself in the future and also not to allow toxic people around you. Because you'll be able to know the warning signs and have a good strong sense of self to not put up with it. Good luck to you and yours. Be safe in all things.", "NTA! Do not tell your dad where you live. He will show up at your doorstep with kids in tow. He will mooch off you like he did to your grandma. He will \u2018borrow\u2019 more money from you he will never repay. \n\nKeep that toxic shit away from you! I know it\u2019ll be hard, especially when kids are involved. If you\u2019re close to your siblings I\u2019d still try to help them somehow without letting your dad know.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them shit. You deserve to live your life independently and also free from people who would just \u201cleech\u201d on you like they did to your grandma.", "NTA!  You are on a shaky foundation in life. You cannot allow that toxic person and his family to destroy you and drag you down.\n\nMost responders here will say to maintain no contact.  I would have to agree.  Your dad will just drag you down to his level.", "Ugh, lose the friends that don\u2019t get it, because you absolutely will be doing the \u201cfriends are my family\u201d thing out of necessity. NTA.", "NTA - With a situation like that and your previous experience there is no need to try. Keep them blocked and out of your life. At least now you can enjoy a home you don't have to suffer in again", "\nNta and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Don't let anyone you know give out your address.....if anyone you know knows your dad or siblings and tells them cut them off because who knows what else they will give out. You don't owe them anything. You're good.", "NTA at all, not even in the slightest!!\n\nYou are doing something that's very hard to do, which is to make something of yourself when you have a toxic family environment.  \n\nWhat you need is encouragement and support to just keep doing what you're doing because you're on the right track!  I have to say I admire your strength.  Hopefully it continues!", "NTA\n \nStay away from them\nand stay safe.", "NTA, family is what you make it and clearly your dad isn\u2019t", "NTA. Moving your deadbeat father and younger siblings into your apartment that you share with a roommate.... That would be the asshole move!", "NTA....you got away, don't give them a chance to visit their toxicity on you again. Keep them blocked.", "NTA.  The toxicity of your dad and his actions are worth staying well away from.  The hard part is his other kids, your siblings at some level, that need to be cared for.  CPS sadly should be part of the response to dealing with him.  sorry, there's not a lot of winning going on here.", "NTA. He's looking at his child like a meal ticket instead of as a child.   \nI have 3 kids. If there was some sort of disaster and I was homeless, I would feel incredibly bad for being forced to stay with a child of mine, even temporarily. I certainly would not feel it was my 'due.'   \nNow, when I'm very old, if I cannot care for myself, I hope that my children would handle the arrangements for my care, that's true. BUT, the key here is that your parent IS able, simply unwilling. You don't owe this man anything. Take care of yourself. Call your grandma. Don't feel guilty.", "NTA that is way too much for someone just starting their life. I am sure he will figure out something. He is not your responsibility.  You would probably get kicked out of where you are living if he moved in. Not worth the drama. Move on with your life and don't look back. I don't blame your Grandmother for kicking him out either. She's probably old and needs some peace.  I hope the future brings you happiness.", "NTA - It sounds like your father is the main issue here, and unfortunately that puts your siblings in a tough spot. That said, it's not your responsibility to fix that or get them out, and the situation with your father is too damn toxic to try and work something out. Stay strong, don't tell them where you live, and enjoy the peace you've carved out for yourself.", "NTA.  Make sure there is no way they can find out where you live.  Anyone who thinks you should give them another chance is clueless.  You finally got away from this, and you need to stay away.  Besides, how would your roommate feel about letting these people into your life?  Think of him or her.  Your dad is someone who could blow up your life in so many ways.  If your roommate moved out, at a job, or whatever.  Keep him away!", "NTA - And BTW, what does your roommate have to say about the possibility of letting this addicted leech into their home?  Not to mention adding that many people into the apartment could well violate the lease agreement.  Tell your \"friends\" that they can offer up their living space if they are so worried about the situation and keep your boundaries.  It may well be that CPS needs to get involved for the children, but your AH dad can deal with his own problems.  Keep your address under wraps and be ready to call the cops if he shows up.  You do not deserve to have to deal with this.", "NTA You're at a point in life you have to choose what's best for YOU and don't allow anyone bring you down goodluck", "Oh love. NTA! Sooo NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. The situation sucks and I wish you had a functional father. But what we know, is that giving him a place to crash, solves nothing. So you wouldn\u2019t be \u2018helping\u2019 him. \n\nApart from that you got out clean! You\u2019re free! STAY free. Family may not understand. But you deserve the space and time to learn about yourself and build the best life you can for yourself. I\u2019m sorry for your siblings. It really sucks. And maybe when you\u2019re more secure/stable you can help them in some way that doesn\u2019t involve letting your dad into your home. \n\nBut for now. Good for you, you got out!", "NTA. There is a reason the youngest called you and not your dad. He's horribly trying to manipulate you and likely nothing has changed from your grandma's situation. Its ok to take care of yourself and you don't  have the capacity to raise your siblings", "NTA\u2026.do not tell them where you live. He will show up and leave the kids and bounce or he will try to force you to let them live there. If he ever leaves his kids in your presence immediately call the police for child abandonment. Document as much as you can. So not let this continue to affect your mental health and well-being. You do not owe him anything!!!!", "NTA.  You don't owe that man so much as a hello.  I understand that you feel for your siblings, however right now there is nothing you can do for them that wouldn't put your security at risk.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The most important part is keeping no contact and taking drastic measures to keep them away, if need be. As for your friends, you probably shouldn't even discuss it with them ever again.

They also have some experience with toxic family from their moms side and wouldn\u2019t let people, family or not, move in without hearing my thoughts first and if they weren\u2019t 100% sure it was temporary. In fact it was their idea to move in together when we both had a plan and I would never want them to have to deal with the same situation I have. I wanna say I love my family and I don\u2019t wanna turn them away out of resentment or hate, but because I genuinely couldn\u2019t help them even if I wanted to. I was miserable having to live with that and I don\u2019t wanna go through it again.
