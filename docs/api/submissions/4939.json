Before I moved out, my living situation wasn\u2019t great. I was raised by my grandmother due to both my bio parents having issues with drugs and mental stuff when I was first born. My dad with my younger siblings moved in with us a couple of years back due to them being evicted from their last home. My grandmother was supposed to have retired by now, but was unable to due to having to care for more people. She and my dad would constantly argue due to him refusing to get a job and move out, or him usually leaving her to watch and provide for his kids while he left for days or even weeks to who knows where, as well as him encouraging my younger siblings to do things like skip school, vape, etc.  He also constantly leeched and asked to \u201cborrow money\u201d not just from my grandmother but me and my younger siblings. Money he never paid back 95% of the time. If I refused or tried to say no he would get angry or say stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything\u201d because there were times I asked him to drive me places when I was younger. You know, things most parents do for their kids without expecting something in return. There\u2019s other things he does too but I won\u2019t list them all. \n\nI wanted to be close to him at a younger age because he had been gone a lot for my early childhood. But after seeing the way he treated his own family and hearing screwed up things he did, I started to distance myself from all of them. When I moved out, I kept my plans private and didn\u2019t give them my address, by saying I was just staying with a friend for a while because I really didn\u2019t want that toxicity to follow me to my new start. Not for a while at least.\n\nAt some point recently, my grandmother finally had enough and forced him out, telling him to take his kids too or she would call CPS. Some of you might think she was in the wrong for this, but again he had been leeching on her and living rent free for two years off her, and had the nerve to constantly insult her when she didn\u2019t want to live with his crap. It wasn\u2019t her responsibility to take care of more grand kids just because he thought because he did it with the first one, so why not the others? \n\nA few days back I got a call from the youngest who told me what happened and said my dad wanted to know where I was. I didn\u2019t want to say and he picked up and got mad, calling me ungrateful and a brat and other terms I don\u2019t want to put. Even if I had enough space which I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t mentally handle any of them right now. I blocked and I haven\u2019t heard from them personally since, only that they\u2019re now staying with an aunt. I spent so long wanting and planning to get away from that hellhole, there was no way I wanted to let it follow me because \u201ciTs fAmiLy\u201d. But I have gotten mixed responses from my friends who say I should have at least tried.

Your roommate and your lease are your trump card. Legally, visitor clause aside, the persons named on the lease are the only ones allowed to inhabit the apartment. Strike 1 for dad. Second, your roommate should be allowed to approve or veto your guests staying overnight at your apartment (you would be allowed the same courtesy). Strike 2.

Leave those dysfunctional home dynamics in your dust.", "NTA just because you have biology tying you to someone does not mean that you should allow them to walk on you to use you to abuse yourself or others. You are very smart to go low contact or no contact with this parent. If you wish to you might have an email set up so siblings can update you of their life plans. But do let everyone know they are not to come to your place you are not going to give that information out and if they press you or hand the phone over to your parent that you will block them. I'm very happy that your grandmother raised you properly to make sure to take care of yourself. And I applaud your grandmother for standing up for herself and reclaiming her home. Whether one is related or not being used and abused is not acceptable. You are not alone. You are not the only person raised by their grandparents. You are not the only person who has toxic families members. I love this quote friends are the family you get to pick. Please keep yourself surrounded with healthy stable supportive individuals. Do not forget that mental health professionals can help you repair some of the side effects left over from toxic family members. I highly encourage you to do that. Because it will make it easier for you to stand up for yourself in the future and also not to allow toxic people around you. Because you'll be able to know the warning signs and have a good strong sense of self to not put up with it. Good luck to you and yours. Be safe in all things.", "NTA! Do not tell your dad where you live. He will show up at your doorstep with kids in tow. He will mooch off you like he did to your grandma.

You cannot allow that toxic person and his family to destroy you and drag you down.\n\nMost responders here will say to maintain no contact.  I would have to agree.

The toxicity of your dad and his actions are worth staying well away from.  The hard part is his other kids, your siblings at some level, that need to be cared for.

He's looking at his child like a meal ticket instead of as a child.   \nI have 3 kids. If there was some sort of disaster and I was homeless, I would feel incredibly bad for being forced to stay with a child of mine, even temporarily. I certainly would not feel it was my 'due.'   \nNow, when I'm very old, if I cannot care for myself, I hope that my children would handle the arrangements for my care, that's true. BUT, the key here is that your parent IS able, simply unwilling. You don't owe this man anything. Take care of yourself. Call your grandma. Don't feel guilty.", "NTA that is way too much for someone just starting their life. I am sure he will figure out something. He is not your responsibility.  You would probably get kicked out of where you are living if he moved in. Not worth the drama. Move on with your life and don't look back. I don't blame your Grandmother for kicking him out either. She's probably old and needs some peace.  I hope the future brings you happiness.", "NTA - It sounds like your father is the main issue here, and unfortunately that puts your siblings in a tough spot. That said, it's not your responsibility to fix that or get them out, and the situation with your father is too damn toxic to try and work something out. Stay strong, don't tell them where you live, and enjoy the peace you've carved out for yourself.", "NTA.  Make sure there is no way they can find out where you live.  Anyone who thinks you should give them another chance is clueless.  You finally got away from this, and you need to stay away.  Besides, how would your roommate feel about letting these people into your life?  Think of him or her.  Your dad is someone who could blow up your life in so many ways.  If your roommate moved out, at a job, or whatever.  Keep him away!", "NTA - And BTW, what does your roommate have to say about the possibility of letting this addicted leech into their home?  Not to mention adding that many people into the apartment could well violate the lease agreement.  Tell your \"friends\" that they can offer up their living space if they are so worried about the situation and keep your boundaries.  It may well be that CPS needs to get involved for the children, but your AH dad can deal with his own problems.  Keep your address under wraps and be ready to call the cops if he shows up.  You do not deserve to have to deal with this.", "NTA You're at a point in life you have to choose what's best for YOU and don't allow anyone bring you down goodluck", "Oh love. NTA! Sooo NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. The situation sucks and I wish you had a functional father. But what we know, is that giving him a place to crash, solves nothing. So you wouldn\u2019t be \u2018helping\u2019 him. \n\nApart from that you got out clean! You\u2019re free! STAY free. Family may not understand. But you deserve the space and time to learn about yourself and build the best life you can for yourself. I\u2019m sorry for your siblings. It really sucks. And maybe when you\u2019re more secure/stable you can help them in some way that doesn\u2019t involve letting your dad into your home. \n\nBut for now. Good for you, you got out!", "NTA. There is a reason the youngest called you and not your dad. He's horribly trying to manipulate you and likely nothing has changed from your grandma's situation. Its ok to take care of yourself and you don't  have the capacity to raise your siblings", "NTA\u2026.do not tell them where you live. He will show up and leave the kids and bounce or he will try to force you to let them live there. If he ever leaves his kids in your presence immediately call the police for child abandonment. Document as much as you can. So not let this continue to affect your mental health and well-being. You do not owe him anything!!!!", "NTA.  You don't owe that man so much as a hello.

The most important part is keeping no contact and taking drastic measures to keep them away, if need be. As for your friends, you probably shouldn't even discuss it with them ever again.

Not if you don't let him through the door. \n\nYou are at a unique point in your life & will never again have the opportunities that you do right now at 19yo You CAN put yourself through college or trade school on scholarships or by working. It took my husband 8 years; it's taking my niece only 5 because she is really good about going after scholarships of all sizes. Even if it takes you 20 years, get yourself job training or a degree. There will be *so many* more opportunities available for you, and the pay is so much better. Otherwise, you are limiting your future. \n\n19yo you has the chance to make these choices. Do what's best not just for yourself, but for your future loved ones.\n\nThis is relevant to your situation bc if you want to help your siblings down the road, or even your father, you will be in a much better place to help them If you help yourself first.
