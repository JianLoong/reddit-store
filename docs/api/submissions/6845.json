The day you lost your mom, your dad lost the love of his life and had to pick up the pieces while also raising young children (including newborn twins!) as a single father.\n\nYour father was lucky enough to get another shot at love and managed to provide for you a mother figure who, by all accounts, sounds like she loved you and was a good person. For 9 years she helped raise you and provide for you, etc. Not for nothing, she invested time, money, energy and love into you. She watched you become an adult and you opted to keep your birth mom (a woman you hardly know, to be frank) as your legal mother. That is your choice of course, but that was probably hurtful to her, and it seems like you didn\u2019t consider how that would make your dad feel\u2026 this rejection of a woman that he loves. \n\nThen for 8 more years after you left the home your dad had to juggle and balance his dedication to you with his dedicated to his wife. I\u2019m not saying that your stepmoms behavior after you moved out was right, but that certainly isn\u2019t your fathers fault and it sounds like he did everything in his power to fix things.\n\nAnd now, finally, after what sounds like 2 decades of familial hardships your dad is going through perhaps one of the darkest times of his life and is likely in a very difficult financial position if he was paying for your step moms treatments for a year and a half.\n\nNo, you should not be fully responsible for covering the funeral costs of someone who was cold to you. But I do think you should be there for your father in his time of need. It sounds like he\u2019s been there for other people his whole life and maybe he needs someone there for him now.\n\nMaybe that means paying for a little bit of the funeral, or maybe that means attending anyway even if you weren\u2019t \u2018invited\u2019. Either way, I think you should reconsider how you want to treat your dad in all this before you do or say something that will irreversibly damage that relationship.", "He was already extremely generous in paying for  the treatment of the liar.", "Nah being dead doesn't change that they were asshole in life.
