No one else waiting in line has an interest or responsibility to teach your 7 year old to use self-checkout. That's not a crucial skill he needs now.

Do it when the store isn't busy. Yes some people are slower than others, but many can't help it. You could have easily done it yourself, but you chose to take longer at the checkout, knowing that there was a line behind you.", "Ummm idk. I used to work at the self checkout when I was a cashier and I thought it was cute and cool when moms would let their kids to the scanning by themselves. But it was also annoying when I had a line down the isle and someone was letting their kid scan their groceries taking all day.   \n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly fine to teach a lesson when business is slow and it\u2019s not a line.

People have to remember that kids need to learn how to operate in the world, lest they be a burden on society.

Let\u2019s say there were 8 registers open.  You\u2019re only slowing down one of them.  Unless this person was the 8th (or later) person in line, you had no effect on their checkout time at all.  None.  I know lines are long, but not usually 8 people long.\n\n\nAnd even if you did slow them down, too bad.  Kids need to learn sometime.  And if you don\u2019t like stores with self checkout, shop somewhere else.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even care if it was that busy. It\u2019s not Black Friday or anything.

Good job teaching your son.", "YTA, it's great that you are teaching your son things! That's actually great and will most likely benefit him in the future. Just don't do it when it's a line of people.\n\nIt reminds when people get their kids to order food and it takes forever because they're nervous.

I\u2019ve seen elderly people take quite a long time in the self checkout, would she yell at them too?", "NTA -- my son is autistic and not a child (23). He is still in school and one of the activities his class does is go to the store and use the self-checkout as a part of learning independence. I do it with him at the store too. If it's busy, I will help, but I usually let him do it himself.", "YTA\nSituational awareness and respecting other people's time are also lessons you could teach your child.\n\nThe world doesn't stop just so your kid can learn at the exact moment you want to teach him.  You should have picked a better time.", "NTA. Plenty of grown people are just as slow as your son and you know what? It may annoy me internally, but I definitely don\u2019t say anything, and I smile politely if we catch each other\u2019s eyes. \n\nPeople at a grocery store already know they\u2019re gonna have to wait for check-out. Your son is a human being with every bit as much of a right to do it as anyone else. And it\u2019s not even like it was the only machine, which is the one scenario in which I might have an issue.\n\nSome people just need to chill. I get that it\u2019s frustrating, but waiting five minutes to check out their groceries is not going to kill anyone. And I will reiterate: plenty of adults take a long time too. I think it\u2019s cool that you\u2019re teaching your son how to do things as they come up, instead of him realizing he doesn\u2019t know how to Adult when he\u2019s eighteen and potentially out of the house.", "NTA. It is what it is. Sometimes there are lines at the store. The kid needs to learn and clearly that AH did not LEARN patience as a child. \n\nThere were 9 other machines.

However,\n\nI am shocked by all the \u201cthe kid has to learn\u201d kind of comments here.\n\nActually, no he does not have to learn how to scan groceries. For crying out loud, he is seven years old.  Is he going to go shopping by himself sometime in the foreseeable future? I think not. Does he need to train so that when he is old enough to go to the store on the his own, he will know how to scan his groceries? Oh, come on. Eventually, when he is old enough to go food shopping on his own, he will also be old enough to either a) figure out how the scanner works on his own or b) show him how it works.\n\nThis is just a kid who wants to do things himself whether or not it is appropriate at the time  and a mother who is more interested in her kid taking every little opportunity to build confidence (which he already apparently has in spades) while caring little to not at all about everyone else in the line.\n\nJust scan your groceries as quickly, efficiently and cheerfully as everyone else \u2026 particularly when the store is busy and let your son prove he can do a multitude of other things that will not take up other people\u2019s time.", "YTA, doing that at anything other than a super slow time is inconsiderate. \n\nNot to mention that even using self check outs is a horrible practice. They literally use you for labour, less staff are hired so less jobs, and you often end up paying more because you aren't trained to ring things in properly ( my local news actually did a study on this, you pay more in the end). \n\nPerhaps not the point but training in the next generation to think these things are normal is speeding us toward a horrible automated future.", "NTA. \n\nSelf checkouts are not meant to be speedy, they are meant to replace cashiers. \n\nIf this person wanted a store with a more predictable line they should have chose one that didn\u2019t have a self checkout.", "If I were waiting in line watching that, I'd be silently blowing a gasket.

I've felt impatient with people at the self serve for being unbelievably slow, but then I remember it's just a checkout, a few minutes won't hurt lol. People need to chill. Also love that your son is wanting to learn! What a great kid! I hope the sad angry lady behind you didn't discourage him", "I agree. I have an 8 year old who thinks using the self check out is the pinochle of fun, but I only let him help I\u2019d we are not at the shop at peek times and there isn\u2019t a queue. The woman didn\u2019t need to talk that way in front of OP\u2019s son, but OP should have a little more awareness and choose appropriate times for her child to learn.", "Agree with this, I have a toddler who just wants to help with everything. If it was busy I would say \"Not now but you can pass me things to scan and put away\". I always let her tap to pay and she loves that too. \n\nIt's definitely not ok to hold up lines but if it were quieter then there would be no issue. Maybe next time take your kid at a less busy hour.", "Gosh I'm getting flashbacks from working in McDs as a teen. There's a special place in hell for parents who tried to get their kids to order their own food at 12pm on a Saturday afternoon, with queues out the door and my manager yelling at us about \"time targets\".\n\nThere is a time and a place to let your kids practice doing this stuff, and it's not when it's incredibly busy with people and huge queues.", "Interesting how people on Reddit always assume everyone posting is a guy, except when they mention taking their son shopping", "Aisle.", "Most self check outs are queues so it's not like OP was holding up all registers. She just held up one. There were 9 other ppl in front of the asshole lady.", "But if there is a line and you have the ability to go faster but choose to go slower, that is selfish and makes you an asshole. Maybe teaching your 7 year old to be considerate is a better lesson than how to scan a barcode.", "You are my spirit animal", "Right?! NTA. The majority of the people in this thread don't remember the days before self checkout. I remember standing in a single line so long my feet hurt and watching the other lines move faster because an item needed to be price checked by the lady two people ahead of you. God, remember the 10 items or less lines as the ONLY kind of fast track? And it was only open if there enough cashiers! While I get times have changed and I'm glad for it, this whole comments section sounds entitled.", "Right? It's a line for a fucking grocery store, not a hospital. They'll live", "Except if you\u2019re waiting for people who are slower and have no other way to check out faster and then there\u2019s this kid also going at a slow pace when his mom, who appears to be of an age where she\u2019d probably be able to check out faster, is just standing there. It all adds up. The other woman was rude but OP should have told her son he could do a few but that she had to finish up so other people could have their turn. That\u2019s also a valuable lesson to learn.", "She could have let him bag or hand things to her. That would have helped everyone", "Whether it's an essential life skill or not is largely irrelevant. Teaching a child independence and encouraging them to have a go at uncharted territory is gonna benefit their development into adulthood massively.", "THIS. My parents never explicitly taught me how to pump gas. So when I was 16 and had just gotten my license, the first time my fuel light went on I confidently pulled into the gas station figuring I knew what to do and holy shit I did NOT know what to do. It took me several minutes to find the gas cap cover opening button (this was before internet on your phone so I couldn\u2019t just google my car lol). The gas cap itself only has arrows pointing in the direction to CLOSE it and it took me a few tries to realize that and be able to take the cap off. And then I completely didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d have to like pump the gas handle a couple of times before gas started coming out. I had to go in and ask the store clerk for help. It was so embarrassing because I just didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. Ugh.", "Really? I see it quite often", "Precisely. Situational awareness and common decency are things OP might want to try to teach her kid instead. Unfortunately it looks like she doesn't have either.", "The queue advances by registers becoming open. If they are all being used, any one single register being slowed down adds to the wait time for everyone in line.", "Being disabled, do you also add to your checkout time by checking your email, voicemail and favorite TikTok videos while you are in the middle of ringing up your items?\n\nIt's not about raw speed, it's about intentionally and knowingly making a choice to move more slowly.", "Not everyone has the luxury of planning better. When I work 80-100 hours a week I don\u2019t get to choose when to go to the grocery store.", "You are just being an arse. He can easily work it out later.", "No offense, but you don't really need to teach anyone to use a self check out. It's self explanatory and literally has on screen instructions. Your son isn't going to be doing groceries on his own and when he is old enough to, he will be able to scan the bar and check out with no problem. I still don't think YTA but you could just show him visually yourself.", "I guess the 7 year old got a couple of life lessons from that experience then", "where i live, the produce is weighed at little machines in the produce section, and it prints out a bar code that can be scanned at the cashier or self checkout.  no idea how things work in his country/region/province/state/banana\\_republic :)", "She didn't take twice as long as others. She took four or five times, if not more, longer than others. So it affected the whole line, she added minutes to everyone's shopping. Had this not been the case, people would have told her how cute her child was instead of calling her an asshole. The rude woman was probably the one who dared to speak while everyone else was glaring daggers.", "Scanning groceries is not something a child who cannot be physically independent from an adult needs to learn during a period where the store is congested.", "You should have let your son help with a few items, not all of them, or taken him at a less busy?", "Then there's me stood behind mother of the year with my POTS gradually making me dizzier and dizzier, the old lady in front of me whose arthritis is killing her, and the guy with the migraine behind us, all of whom just wanted to grab a couple of essentials and get gone, all being forced to watch playtime.", "But the old man was moving at the best speed he could. OP consciously made the decision to greatly delay their own checkout speed, and to add that much time to everyone's wait in the store.\n\nNot the same.", "At least you were helpful. I worked at Target for a short while when I was 19, and had a guy come through with a shitload of produce, many of which I hadn\u2019t seen before and while learning 3 pages of produce codes. Dude was a nightmare about it, all impatient and yelling at me. Over fucking produce. It\u2019s been over a decade and I still remember that. I hope his produce went bad quickly.", "I\u2019d probably need help identifying the flavor of lettuce too, but in my defense we never have lettuce at home because my mom\u2019s body has decided it\u2019s unacceptable lmao", "My dad used to take us on saturdays in the morning before it got busy. She might try that. Or a Sunday but before all the churches let out. Produce is better in the morning anyway, before it\u2019s been picked over by a bunch of people who are looking for the same things you are.", "Employee's perspective: the speed of the line isn't any individual customer's responsibility. When it's their turn at the self-checkout they can stand there staring at it for 10 minutes before paying for all I care, it's their turn with the machine until they're done.", "Exactly this, people need to remember that strangers dont give a shit about your child, teach them shit where it doesn't slow everyone else's day. Some people have places to be and they're at the stor for its intended purpose (to buy groceries and leave) so why should we wait on you to teach your kid something it could easily learn in seconds by themselves like everyone else did", "this 100%. self checkout=your own speed. the amount of entitled ass people in these comments are astonishing. there were ten other self checkout lanes and im sure there were lanes with cashiers as well. it\u2019s a public grocery store, if the mom wants her kid to scan the groceries then so be it!", "Either way, take a damn breath. Cussing at a 7 year old is just so unnecessary. I just wait til I\u2019m in the car to bitch about it, like a normal person. It\u2019s not a situation to make such a fuss like that.", "bro just go to the next open one goddamn. why be fixated on the mom and her kid when there are 9 other registers available? i wouldn\u2019t even give them a second thought", "I was trying to find a comment like this.  There were no self checkouts when I was a kid.  When they started becoming a thing, I used them without needing help from anyone.  I'm not sure a 7 year old really needs to be taught this in order to survive once they've turned 18.  It's fine to let them try it, but yeah, not during a busy time.", "Yep, curtesy is ALSO a lesson to teach children!", "It\u2019s not about learning specific skills but concepts and problem solving. That\u2019s what still separates us from AI.", "Excellent points. I\u2019d thought about the social anxiety angle, but not the financial anxiety part. Im disabled and I use self check because I know if I bag my groceries, everything will be bagged as I need it. When I get home from shopping, I put my fridge/freezer items away and everything else waits until after I rest. At regular checkouts, more than once I\u2019ve asked for fridge/freezer items to be grouped together with everything else separate, gone home and put those away only to come back hours later to find a cashier or bagger has put perishables in the bottom of a bag with non perishables on top and it\u2019s unfrozen and ruined in the time it\u2019s taken me to rest. (My \u201cfavorite\u201d was a kid bagging most everything else up well but putting ice cream in the bottom of a bag and then stacking canned food on top of that. It was about 60 degrees that day, so I just left what I thought was the canned food in the car, figuring I could take it in after a while. A couple hours later I had a lovely mess to clean up)", "It was literally started as a fast lane for people to move efficiently\u2026 everyone just wants to do it on now their own regardless of their skillset.", "Sometimes we have to remind ourselves that as adults we don't magically know everything. Sorry that happened to you. \n\nThis holiday, I was telling my friend(30s F) about my leek and cheese pie recipe. \n\nShe had no idea what a leek was, despite being a great southeast Asian cook. Just never came up as an ingredient for her. \n\nMy first instinct was to tell her that it was the vegetable that the Pok\u00e9mon Farfetch'd carried. I only got a blank look.\n\nI didn't realize that despite being with her gamer BF for ages, she didn't know Pok\u00e9mon.  Had to describe it as large scallions and show her a photo on my phone. \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but I get that error message every time when I bag stuff. Like I scan something, set it down and immediately get that error message.", "I'm absolutely flabbergasted at this point by the many people who basically say kids are less than. A while ago I would've said people pointing out how children are treated like an inconvenience are exaggerating, but it's happening right here. Why is everyone's time worth so much more? Why are kids such an inconvenience? 'Teach 'em when it isn't busy' ok how about when you hate queuing so much you go when it's less busy? 'Some people can't help themselves being slow' you mean like a 7 yr old who does it for the first time? They aren't pets, they aren't something you just shove to the side whenever you come along. Children are part of society and they have every right to be there,  just like every adult. I'd even understand when they had blocked the only checkout, but it was one out of ten. People really need to get their shit together.", "right!! she could\u2019ve gone to a cashier if she was in such a hurry. if that was my kid, i\u2019d def have some shxt to say to her & it wouldn\u2019t be friendly.", "Unless you're super young you figured out how to work a self checkout the way all of us did -- i.e. as an adult when your local store introduced them. It's not like they've been around since childhood for most of the adult population.", "Agreed 100%. Years of retail do pay off lmao", "Honestly in some cases (albeit probably not that many) it is a skill can transfer to other jobs too.  At my job we have a lot of scanners that help with tracking part/chemical inventory and product locations.  Some are hand scanners and some are attached to shelves and tables.  When I first started I was coming off eight years of working retail and I've always been the fastest when using them.  I just know the optimum distance to get it to scan immediately, the right angle to hold it at if the label is faded or damaged, ect.  Yeah anyone can do it, but I was just faster at it so I was pretty often picked to be the guy put in charge of organizing our storage room and loading up our work stations.", "Theres a difference between wanting to be in and out and wanting the shop to take a normal reasonable amount of time.\n\nIf I go into a shop to get some bread and milk, I might not be in a hurry, but I still don't want it to take 40mins when I could have taken 15.", "Ok, as someone who works in a liquor store in the rough side of town, that would help SO much with theft. It happens almost daily and so hard to stop.\n\nBut I know times are absolutely shit right now, I get it, sometimes I just go meh when I know I can't stop them. \n\nI just work for a corporation that makes billions and gives nothing.", "Yes indeed. The mother has never once had the chance to step into a store when it wasn't this busy, because this is the only store with a self service checkout and she only exists on weekends.", "More and more stores are doing this in the US.  Amazon has their grocery stores that don't even have cashiers.  And Walmart\\\\Sams Club (among others - it's catching on) use Scan & Go via their store apps on your phone so then you just waltz right out and show your phone at the exit.", "Some of our supermarkets in Australia are the same. You scan items within the store app as you shop, then get a QR code to scan at a specific checkout at the end. \nIt\u2019s fabulous - I just wish it were more common!"]}
