Leash laws in most places only apply OFF property and in my state require that the dog be out of the owners control off their property. If the dog was in the street aggressively coming towards you, yes, you would have a reason to jump on the whole ass hood of a car but a dog walking towards you thats on its own property? Heck, no. How do you know there wasn't an invisible fence preventing it from leaving the property. Get some therapy for your unrealistic fear of a walking dog, and next time, just calmly walk across the street.", "YTA  \n\n\nWe all have phobias. I had a good chunk of my face ripped off by a dog when I was a kid and are still terrified of them. Doesn't mean I can't control myself like an adult when I see one. I don't go damaging other peoples property because of MY issues with them.   \n\n\nCause look at it from this point of view: You walked towards the dogs home, panicked when he (still inside his own yard and friendly by your own words) came closer, you jumped up, the owner came out and ushered the dog away with no harm to you, and you think not only are you entitled to act that way, but also entitled to damage his car because... of your feelings?   \nShit, does that mean I get to smash up the next bank with a scary teller behind the glass? What about flail my arms about in my grandmothers house because she owns birds, smashing everything I can reach?   \n\n\nThen why tf do you think you have a right to damage other peoples stuff for your phobias?", "INFO: did the dog ever leave its property? This sounds like you trespassed which of course would make you an asshole. And idk where you live but saying \"leash laws apply\" on private property doesn't make sense anywhere I've lived.", "YTA  \n\n\nYou damaged the man's property.  Pay him.    \n\nHow on earth do you think this is the dog owner's fault?  \n\nHow could he imagine that you would get so terrified of a dog on its own property would force you to  jump on top of a car?   \n\nDid you ever think of being nice?   Did you consider asking him nicely to hold his dog for a moment til you left because you're afraid of dogs?    Most reasonable would understand and just grab the dog for a minute. \n\nYou overreacted in this situation and caused the dent yourself.", "YTA sounds like the dog wasn't barking at you and you made a ton of assumptions about what would happen due to your own fears and then decided to dent the man's car. You could've chosen to walk on the other side of the road.\n\nIf I was the man, I'd sue you", "INFO: Did the dog leave the yard?", "INFO: how do you know the dog / yard did not have an invisible fence?", "YTA\n\nIts not about the dog or the leash, it's about how you walk away after he called you out about the dent.\n\nAbout the leash or not, refer to your state law.", "YTA. The dog didn't even leave his yard, and instead of crossing the street to get away from a dog that was walking towards you (though, again, he never left his yard), you decided to jump on a vehicle and damage it? And, to make it even worse, you shouted at the owner and told him this was all his fault? \n\nTalk about entitlement. You don't have the right to vandalize people's property because you're not a fan of their dogs.", "YTA\n\nNot saying the guy isn't at fault as well, but the fact that you visibly DENTED HIS CAR and did nothing about it is not okay. Should he have had his dog on a leash? Yes. Are you in the wrong for being mad at him for that? No. Are you in the wrong for causing property damage and not exchanging insurance information for that or offering to pay? Absolutely.", "YTA you big drama queen. Whatever it is the problem you have with dogs it's not excuse to damage people's property. For the sounds of it the dog was walking in it's own yard and you decided to make a big drama out of it.", "YTA - for all you know they had an invisible dog fence because the dog never left its property.", "YTA if the dog was within the property lines it was hardly out of control.  Getting on the hood of the car seems likes an overreaction.  Especially if you caused damage to the vehicle.", "Doesn\u2019t seem like the dog was out of control nor left the property. Kudos for jumping like George of the jungle.", "YTA, I know of no area that requires leashing a dog on your own property.  Your should be arrested and sued for vandalizing the car.", "YTA. Nowhere here do you indicate that the dog got anywhere close to you, or close to leaving its own yard. Given your attitude I'm sure you would have said it if so.", "Yta Lol sounds like you prolonged the interaction-your so scared you\u2019re gonna hang around in the direct vicinity instead of getting the hell away??", "YTA. Just because you're scared of dogs does not give you the right to tell a property owner what he can or cannot do on his own property, or to damage his possessions. Be a decent human being and go back, apologize and offer to pay for the damage you did. It was not his fault, don't blame others for your phobias.", "Had to think for a second but I\u2019d say YTA. Should the dog have been on a leash? If it\u2019s the law, yeah. Responsible dog owners should be in control of their dog at all times.\n\nBut if you really don\u2019t want a dog approaching you, the best thing to do is probably ignore it and keep walking. Dogs want attention and they want to explore what\u2019s in their \u201dterritory\u201d. If you don\u2019t give it attention and leave, most dogs will lose interest. If this dog was left out there unleashed, he likely doesn\u2019t have a problem with leaving the property. I obviously can\u2019t verify that, but assuming owner competence, it\u2019s most likely the case. \n\nThe real question is *why on earth would you leap onto the hood of a car to avoid a dog?* Were there not better alternatives like crossing the street or just\u2026 getting off their property? Most driveways are near the property line, so it seems foolish to jump on someone\u2019s car instead of taking two steps off their property and walking away. I know nothing about the law, but you may want to pay that guy for the damage you did to his car, because he might try to sue.", "NTA. OP had no way of knowing that the dog couldn't leave the property b/c of an invisible fence. Dog owner should put up signs showing where the dog is contained.", "Today on aita: Am I the ah for causing property damage and fleeing the scene with no intention of fixing said property damage?", "Yta the dent is YOUR fault.", "Hopefully he has camera footage of you damaging his car.

You said nothing about repairing the damage you caused.", "I\u2019m a dog owner. I do think the dog owner should have controlled their dog better. You don\u2019t have to like dogs. It\u2019s whatever. But YTA for just jumping onto a car to avoid said dog, and then not taking responsibility for the fact you did dent the car. It doesn\u2019t matter if the dog should or should not have been on a leash, you still did damage to the vehicle.", "NTA for asking the owner to control the dog, honestly sick of dogs being friendly being used as an excuse for having to put up with other peoples animals annoying me. I couldn't care less If the dog is on their property, if there are no fences there is zero guarantee of no contact. And historically every single encounter like this has been a fuck up despite owners insistence that their dog is this magic unicorn that behaves and has manners. \n\nBut jumping on his car. Um. A bit too far?", "Fake as shit", "YTA. That dog never left its own yard. Go back there and pay that man for the dent in his car.", "Where do you live that pets must be leashed on private property?\n\nIn any event, YTA.", "I\u2019m going to hope this is fake but I\u2019ll answer honestly. \n\nYTA and a major one at that. I don\u2019t like dogs, never have and never will. You know what I do when I leased dogs walk up to me? I walk away or try to find the owner cause I have a heart. This was such an overreaction you should honestly be ashamed to be a grown man jumping on a strangers car because a dog looked at you. You caused that dent in his car so it\u2019s your responsibility to pay for it.", "YTA you overreacted", "YTA. You sound ridiculously entitled. Like I can't even wrap my head around what your worldview must be for you to actually think you aren't the asshole in this scenario.\n\nFor one thing, the dog is on his property. Those bylaws don't apply to his property. Second, the dog never left his property, so you had no reason to jump on his car. \n\nYou should go back there and pay for the damages you caused. But you won't, because of course you won't", "YTA and a tool. It\u2019s on its property.", "Did you consider, I dunno, WALKING AWAY? The dog did nothing to you.

Grow up and pay for the damages.\n\nYou may also want to look into local leash laws because it is very common for \"control\" to be enough to satisfy them even without a leash.", "YTA and a big wussy to boot. I hope he sues you.", "\"He tells me the dog is staying in the yard\"\n\nYou admit the dog never left the yard and then changed your story in the comments, saying it came on the sidewalk.\nSeems like you could've just kept walking in the first place.\n\nYTA", "People have utterly lost their minds when it comes to dogs, unfortunately.  These days everyone seems to think that the precious pupper wupper should be allowed to do whatever it wants and people can get fucked.  Imo the owner should be thankful you didn\u2019t kick the Shit out of its unrestrained mutt", "YTA, you damaged his car.  Did the dog ever leave its yard? Usually the law is dogs need to be leashed when they're off their property. Maybe he has an invisible fence. And you probably should find another neighborhood  for your walks.", "YTA\n\nHe\u02bbs right. No dog has to be leashed on its own property.\n\nYou broke the law with that hood stunt. You owe him for damages and he could have you arrested.\n\nYou need to deal with your dog phobia. That\u02bbs on you. Not on the rest of the world to accommodate you.", "NTA, its never okay for unleashed dogs to approach strangers.  The dog owner is the asshole.", "ESH\n\nIf the dog didn't actually leave his property line, it wasn't attacking you. But I also understand why you might be concerned that it *would* leave the property line and why having a dog unleashed in an unfenced front yard is dangerous to everyone, including the dog. \n\nBut damaging a car isn't ok either if you weren't in immediate danger. Especially as you could have crossed the street/kept walking/walked to the other side of the vehicle as a barricade.", "ESH. He shouldn't have let his dog unleashed, but you shouldn't damage his property. You weren't in any danger and the dog wasn't pursuing you, you could have just continue your walk without the need to jump on the car.", "You\u2019re liable for the damage to his car. Hope he calls the police. The dog did not leave his property. YTA.", "Yta. Get therapy and pay for the dent your irrational fears caused.", "YTA\nDog showed no aggression whatsoever and stayed on its own property. You could have walked across the road if you were that worried.", "Yes, YTA. The dog never left its property. You spectacularly overreacted and damaged that guy\u2018s truck.", "So it never even left the yard? Why the hell didn't you just go to the other side of the street? Ugh, you sound annoyingly dramatic. You're lucky he was nice enough to let you just walk away after doing that because not everyone would. YTA.", "YTA definitely. You owe that man money. Go pay up. You overreacted on purpose and jumped on that car trying to make a point like an idiot", "YTA. Good grief, you jumped on the hood of his car over a dog that hadn't even left his property or acted threatening? Pay for the dent and work on your phobia.", "YTA\n\nWho TF chooses to react by climbing on a car?! And if the car didn't belong to the dog owner, what would you have done; run away like a coward like you already did? Go back and pay for the dent. Also, if this is a phobia from past trauma, you need help to fix it. Even if not, you need help. You had a major overreaction to a dog in its own yard. In that context, your discomfort does not matter.", "As someone that's been bit, I'm going to actually say N T A about the first reaction but YTA about jumping on the car.\n\nI don't usually have an issue with dogs if they're immediately with the owner and preferably on a leash.  But a dog that appears to be unsupervised and not visibly tethered down would have me anxious, especially if it doesn't react to me trying to get it to leave me alone.\n\nSure it may have been in someone's yard, but the transition from the edge of someone's yard to the sidewalk where I am is very small. The argument of \"it's in his yard!\" is not exactly black and white.\n\nStill though - jumping on a car seems silly to me. I'd rather just start walking away from it even if it meant walking backwards in the direction I came from. And since you did cause damage OP, you have to rectify that. I do not believe your excuse is valid here.", "Op your nta don't gaf about what other people say they weren't there you where right", "[removed]", "You sound like a wuss Yta", "YTA.  Also, you're a vandal at this point.", "YTA for not liking dogs.", "YTA. The only one who sounds out of control here is you... not the dog. You said it approached you? Tail wagging or hackles up? Running or walking towards you? From the little you said it sounds like it was probably walking towards you, wagging it's tail... not running at you with it's hackles raised or growling. It stayed in it's yard (which I'm sure as others have pointed out may have had an invisible fence). It didn't leave the yard. Meanwhile you stopped your walk to yell at it and jumped on a car. I get you were scared. Own that (get some help dude before someone sues you for damaging property) and move on.", "YTA. Walk to the other side of the street if you are that scared of a dog in its own yard. Had you simply continued walking instead of stopping and engaging with the dog it probably wouldn\u2019t have even approached you.", "YTA big time. I hope he calls the cops on you and you get charged for damage. If you are that scared of dogs that you damage other people\u2019s property trying to avoid them when they are STILL ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY then you shouldn\u2019t be out in public", "YTA. As long as the dog stayed on his property it\u2019s not your business. You can review  laws about leashes. On the flip side, you can\u2019t jump on his car. It makes no sense you even jumped on their car if you were so scared of the dog. Pay for the damages, get therapy or don\u2019t leave the house. Who knows what reaction you\u2019re going to blame your fear for next.", "YTA\n\nhow do you function in society?", "NTA, there's a shit ton of dog people here. Unleashed dogs are dangerous. Plus it's extremely irresponsible too. Since the car was in the street I don't see any issue in using it to get away from the dog. Strangers have no idea what your dog is like and whether or not it's fully vaccinated, plus people can have traumas about dogs too. It's rude AF to think everyone is fine with their dog running off the property onto public land and straight to you smfh. Dude deserved the dent on his car tbh. What if someone is severely allergic to dogs like I am? The owner would have to be held accountable for any medical bills should my allergies act up since he can't seem to bother leashing his dog.", "NTA", "Your fear of dogs is your truth, but YBTAH, when you damaged his car.\n\nDamn, we just experienced this same situation.

I'm not sure where you stand *legally* regarding any damage to the car, but NTA for *taking issue with an unleashed dog in their front yard*", "ESH, he should\u2019ve had his dog in a fence or in a leash but you damaged his car. You owe him whatever costs to repair it.", "Unleashed dogs not enclosed in a fence is always problematic to me. I LOVE dogs. But uncontrolled dogs, (even if the sweetest babies) are liabilities to everyone. The owner is 100% at fault. I assume that you weren\u2019t walking into his yard but on the sidewalk or street. I love dogs but just as I approach a strange dog to pet I stand a distance away and put my hand out in a friendly manner waiting for them to come to me. A lot of dogs come hesitantly and find out that you\u2019re a friend which is always a dopamine rush for me. However, I\u2019ve also been bombarded by well-meaning friendly dogs who haven\u2019t been trained and are very excitable- dogs over 100 lbs+  that threaten to knock you down by their sheer excitement. I (again a dog lover) do not appreciate being jumped on by dogs, but particularly large ones. I would never be litigious, but I do think it\u2019s just not responsible. You don\u2019t mention anything like that here but I think the same thing applies- NOT EVERYONE LIKES DOGS, some people have traumatic experiences with dogs, some people have small children and big ol good-intentioned puppers can and have injured them just by being overly friendly and hyper. Keep your dogs controlled by whatever means (leash, gate, kennel) at all times. Even if they\u2019re friendly. Even if they\u2019re 8 lbs. It will keep the owner from litigation and keep everyone safe.\n\nAs far as the dent goes, if the dog was unleashed but scared you, even if it did not attack, I would assume a judge in small claims court would place it on the fault of the owner of the dog. I don\u2019t know this but it\u2019s the most common sense argument and I like to assume that most judges have common sense. \n\nI think it\u2019s absolutely not your fault. Dogs are capable of amazing feats and just like people- some have temperament issues. You\u2019re not the asshole. Anyone who lets their dog out without a leash and without boundaries is the asshole. \n\nI like to think I know how my dog will act in certain situations but ole boy is a pupper. To me, it\u2019s like not paying attention to what my 6 year old does and giving her the keys to the car. I\u2019m sure wherever she was trying to go was well-meaning, but as a responsible adult you would never let a child carry that responsibility. Same with a dog.", "NTA. He\u2019s not only breaking the law, but clearly gives no shits about his own dog\u2019s safety.", "NTA. You don't get to unleash your dog if you don't have a proper fence. I don't care about the laws.", "ESH. I don't think I can say you're innocent because you damaged his car and walked away. He's definitely an asshole because, idc what the other comments are saying, an unsupervised, unsecured dog is an asshole move no matter where it is. Dog could run off and get hit by a car, dog could get into something that could make it it sick, dog could hurt itself or someone else. \n\nIf he had been outside with his dog in his own yard, you would have been the asshole.

I would walk on the other side of the street from now on though.", "NTA", "ESH. Despite others trying to invalidate you, leash law differs depending on your state/county/city. You could very well have a leash law for private property. \n\nThe owner should have kept his dog from going to the sidewalk, and the nice thing to do would have been for him to grab the dog instead of doing the whole \u201che\u2019s friendly\u201d bit. My dog is friendly too, but that does not mean that he likes everybody. Especially people exhibiting fear. Better safe than sorry. Had he grabbed his dog from the start, the situation wouldn\u2019t have escalated.\n\nThat being said, your fear(which is reasonable) does not absolve you of property damage.
