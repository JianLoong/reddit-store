{"id": 2585, "submission_id": "yy3zct", "title": "AITA for using a spray bottle to keep my wife and kids out of my office when I am in a meeting.", "selftext": "I have two sons 3 and 5. My wife is a stay at home mom. I work from home 3 days a week. It's good because I can help out with the kids and give my wife a break. I leave the door to my office open 80% of the time. I have explained to my wife multiple times that when my door is shut I am in a meeting and I cannot help and I need her to not interrupt me.\n\nShe keeps opening the door to see if I need anything, or to let the kids in to see me, or to take out the garbage. I wait until after my meeting and then I tell her again that if my door is closed I NEED her to leave me alone and keep the kids away from me. She just cant keep it in her head. I told her that I was going to get a lock for the office if she could not understand what it meant when the door is closed. She said I was being mean to her and treating her like a child and that I did not need to lock her out of the office.\n\nI have plants in my office that I take care of so I have a spray bottle that I keep for misting them. So last week I was in a meeting and she came in again to see if I needed anything from the store because she was going grocery shopping with her mom. I asked her politely to close the door because I was in a meeting. She said sorry and closed the door.  My meeting had just finished and she opened the door again. So I sprayed her. She shut the door. Then she called me an asshole for treating her like a misbehaving animal. I asked her if she understood what it meant when my door was closed. She shut up and left with her mom.\n\nSo before I get dogpiled I will clear some stuff up. I work 40 hours a week. I might have my door closed for 8 of those. So on the weekends we take care of everything together. Monday through Friday there are only 8 hours where I need to be left alone. My children know better than to open the door when it is closed. But she just does not get it.\n\nSo now I am at the point where I have given her a choice. I can start spraying her on camera during my meetings, I can get a lock for my door, or I can just go into work in town every day. If I do the last one it means she is stuck in the house all day with the kids because we only have the one car.\n\nI am at my wits end and I feel like an asshole for treating her this way but I do not want to get fired or forced to work at the workplace because I cannot have meetings when I work from home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry my math sucks. It might be more than 20% because I only work 24 hours at home so it is more like 33%. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1668725074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy3zct/aita_for_using_a_spray_bottle_to_keep_my_wife_and/", "score": 714, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get that lock, your wife should be able to respect that when the door is closed you're having a work meeting and need privacy. Your children understand the concept better than she does!\n\nThe spraying wasn't your first action, it was the result of her continued interruptions. If she has concerns she needs to say so in a mature way, or at the very, very least knock instead of poking her head in.", "I was all set to say Y T A based on the title, but NTA.  You have told her over and over again not to bother you if your door is closed.  That's not a hard thing to remember.  She needs to start being a better partner.  How about a sign that you can put on the door?", "NTA.   I am a wife and I'm annoyed on your behalf, so trust me when I say: keep spraying her.  Obviously verbal communication isn't working, so she needs the mist reminder.", "NTA. I\u2019m a wife, mother, and 40 her per week hybrid worker. Reading this made my blood boil. Working from home is a privilege which can benefit every member of the house if done properly. She\u2019s taking it for granted and about to ruin it for everyone", "NTA\n\nShe's not being treated like a child.   The children have learned.

Get a lock for the door.", "Nta. \n\n>She said I was being mean to her and treating her like a child and that I did not need to lock her out of the office.\n\nClearly she is acting like a child and does need to be locked out of the office. If my dog can understand that a closed door means he can't come in, surely your wife can too.", "NTA\n\nWhat's her suggestion to staying out of the office? Because she can't respect the door being shut and thinks a lock would be childish.", "NTA, these people giving you Y T A comments seem to be missing the part where you tried to talk about a lock and she pouted and threw a fit about not being locked out. You then reinforced the don\u2019t come in when the door is closed, only for her to completely disregard a boundary and potentially costing you guys your income. Next time, buy a nerf gun and shoot her in the face when she comes in.", "Just get a lock", "NTA, but just get a lock for your door.  The spray bottle, while warranted, is demeaning.  A lock is not.", "I don\u2019t want to judge because it sounds like you have tried over and over to communicate but she can\u2019t remember. I\u2019d lock the door over spraying though.", "LOL funny how you get rid of her!\n\nMy husband works from home 3x week also (what a coincidence!!) in one of our bedrooms. \nOur kids understand to not barge into the bedroom when he\u2019s working. \n\nYou guys have smart phones, right? Can\u2019t she just text you ? \n\nI just text him if I need to talk to him or ask him something. \n\nNTA!", "NTA - she keeps pushing your boundaries and you snapped.   Spraying her wasn't a very nice thing to do but she's not being nice either.\n\nI'd just start going to the office.  Getting a lock will just mean she keeps knocking and calling out to you. That's probably worse.\n\nNot being there is the only way to probably prevent this.  That would would be a consequence of her actions as she's been told time and time again to not interrupt when the door is shut.\n\nSo apologise for spraying her and the in the same sentence say that you are now required to come to work for those meetings!", "NTA\n\nYou tried reasoning. That clearly didn't work.\n\nI am sure she feels humiliated, but she should have listened and respected your very reasonable boundaries when you set them like a rational human being.", "N T A.  Get a lock, she apparently does not understand boundaries.  Let her be mad.  If she can't understand stay out if the door is closed, then you need to do what you have to do to keep from getting in trouble with work.  Make a sign for the door. \"I'M IN A MEETING.  DO NOT ENTER.\"", "NTA - I mean, spraying her is not the best option, but she's a grown ass woman and if she can't keep out of the room while OP's in a meeting, that's what she gets. \n\nAm I the only one that thinks if he gets a lock for the bedroom door, she's just going to pound on it and interrupt him that way?", "Lol I love this. Sure you\u2019re treating her like a child because she\u2019s acting like a child. If the door is always open than the fact alone that it\u2019s closed should be reminder enough. NTA", "NTA. This is so funny to me. Keep it up. She is literally jeopardizing your employment by refusing to prioritize your need for privacy", "NTA is someone does not learn from words then they are willfully ignoring instructions.

Tell her her actions aren't showing you respect, and how it's making you feel. Ask her for her reasons as to why she keeps feeling the need to interrupt. There might be some insecurities at play or perhaps she just hasn't been taking you seriously.\n\nIf she still ignores the boundary you have set, then spray away.

That's weird to me and maybe a bit of a power play but that's just me....  If she wants to continue to have you home to help during the week, it might be a good idea to not be disruptive during important work hours or feel the consequences.  All actions have consequences especially after you have been told numerous times as an adult what the expectation is.", "NTA only because WTF. What is the deal with these partners who can\u2019t respect WFH spaces? This is not the only post like this. It\u2019s insanity. I would flip the fuck out.", "NTA. This is hilarious. Just get the lock dude. If she wants to be treated like an adult than she should act more mature than your small children who can grasp a small concept better than her.", "> She said I was being mean to her and treating her like a child \n\nProbably because she\u2019s acting like one by not being able to remember and respect a very simple and common boundary. \n\nNTA. You\u2019re not asking for anything difficult. It\u2019s not hard to remember. You\u2019ve repeatedly tried to have respectful conversations about this. You\u2019ve repeatedly explained things to her. It\u2019s not like you told her once and then started with the petty passive aggressive behaviour. When reasonable conversations don\u2019t work, you need to try another tactic. \n\n> I asked her if she understood what it meant when my door was close. She shut up\n\nSo\u2026 she has known the whole time and just not cared? Cause it seriously sounds like she just thinks it\u2019s a stupid rule she shouldn\u2019t have to follow, so she doesn\u2019t regardless of what you have expressed you need.", "NTA. You've tried reasoning with her like an adult and she's forcing your hand. I'd get the lock, but be prepared for her to start calling out for you and knocking continuously while you're in meetings. \n\nI would give her a heads-up, that you're getting a lock and that if she makes a ruckus, you're going to have to go in to work full time. That you would love to be able to stay at home, but she's being very disrespectful, and putting both your livelihoods in jeopardy. Tell her you feel bad for spraying her, but you're at your wits end with how she's been treating you.", "NTA \n\nMy husband is in the same boat as you and when he needs to be left alone he closes his office door. Even our 4 yo gets the concept, your wife should be able to too. Since she can\u2019t, just get a lock. It\u2019s not personal, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s taking it that way when you\u2019ve brought up wanting to do that. \n\nWhen my husband is wfh the things I may want to tell my husband during the day I text him. He gets back to me when it\u2019s convenient for him, which may be during a meeting, might not. If she\u2019s heading to the store and you actually want something, but don\u2019t text back because you\u2019re too busy it\u2019ll be understood that it\u2019ll wait till next time. Same with anything else she may want to interrupt you for. Barring an emergency of course. \n\nMaybe telling her to text you the things she\u2019s interrupting your meeting for instead would work for you two like it does us. Bottom line, I think you\u2019re more than justified in getting a lock.", "NTA, my spouse works from home and we have the same agreement. Door open-available, door closed-unavailable. It\u2019s really not that hard to grasp and respect. I would go back to in person work more days if she can\u2019t respect your work hours.", "NTA\n\nI work from home. I have worked from home for 20 years. My kids are trained that even if the door is open, they don\u2019t just run into my office making noise. They stand in my peripheral vision until I stop what I\u2019m doing and turn to them. As preschoolers they understood how to do this! \n\nMy office entrance doesn\u2019t have a door, so when Covid hit and everyone was home all day, I put up a curtain and said, \u201cCurtain closed means do not interrupt me.\u201d  One day my husband poked his head in to say goodbye as he was leaving to go on errands and I gave him the most shocked, annoyed look. He mentioned it to the kids and they said, \u201cDad, don\u2019t you know the RULES?\u201d We all laughed about it but he never did it again!", "NTA. If your 5 year old is capable of grasping this concept I'm not sure what's going on with your wife. Some weird power play?\n\n\nGet one of these doorstop locks you get for hotels. I have a feeling though that'll just lead to her coming and banging on the door (when she could just text you).", "NTA. She\u2019s choosing to treat your home office like you\u2019re just hanging out. She wouldn\u2019t get sprayed literally at all if she didn\u2019t bother you. \n\nYou should absolutely get a lock for your door.", "NTA, that\u2019s hilarious. I wouldn\u2019t *keep* doing it if I were you, but she has to understand the boundary. Could you post a sign on your door saying \u201cmeeting in progress, please do not disturb\u201d? Otherwise a lock might be the only way.", "NTA see if you can work from the office for week maybe that will drive home the point for her! 50 hrs all alone with the kids might be the attitude adjustment required to help respect the meeting boundary!", "HAHA omg, NTA. maybe slightly an asshole but too funny.\n\nMy advice is get a doorstop and wedge the door shut from the inside.", "Put up a sign on the door that says \u201ckeep out - yes that means you wifey\u201d. NTA.", "You have been very patient and reasonable when many people would be frustrated, even angry. Your livelihood and therefore the welfare of the entire family is on the line, yet your wife cannot bring herself to respect a simple rule.

It is possible that she will rap on the door if you lock it, so you might have to go ahead and go to the office to work until she gets the idea.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s not that she can\u2019t keep it in her head-she doesn\u2019t care. I have a suspicion she doesn\u2019t like not knowing what you are doing.", "NTA. Get a lock. I don\u2019t think your wife would pay any attention to a sign.", "NTA, bt if you continue to deal with this by spraying her you will be.\n\nGet a lock. ASAP.", "NTA you need your office to work.", "NTA. I spray my kids, their friends, pets and husband when they get on my nerves \ud83d\ude39. She should learn after a couple of sprays, and then you don\u2019t have to bother with the lock.", "NTA\n\nIf there are ramifications for your interrupted meetings, they affect her. She need to understand that she has no say in how that would go.\n\nIt\u2019s not an unreasonable rule. She needs to dump the ego.", "NTA. I don't agree with spraying your wife, but it sounds like you only did it once, and it's not something you've made a habit of.

The obvious hasn't worked.", "INFO: When you are in a meeting, is she visible on the camera when she comes in?", "NTA and I definitely chuckled reading this. Hopefully they leave you alone now.", "NTA and get a super soaker if she keeps it up. She obviously does not give a crap about what you think regarding this topic.", "NTA. Buy a nerf gun.", "NTA, it can\u2019t be that hard to stay out.

What the hell is her problem?", "NTA. You explained it to her multiple times.  That's actually pretty funny.", "NTA. you wouldn\u2019t have to do this if she didn\u2019t act like a child", "NTA\nGet a lock. If she starts banging on the door then then just start going in for work.", "NTA. What is your wife's problem? Because you told her more than once and she just doesn't care... So weird and actually kind of a red flag even though it's such an odd one. Just tell her that for the next 2 weeks, a closed door means she can't come in and if she decides to ignore that, a lock will be installed. Plain and simple.

Personally I\u2019d get the lock anyway.", "NTA That's obnoxious I'd say lock the door but then she'd resort to banging on the door. Tell her one last time and if she keep barging in you may need to go back to working in the office", "NTA \n\nHonestly, just get a lock. \n\nUnrelated - you should stop misting your plants. It's really not beneficial and increases the chances of things like fungal issues.", "NTA. Working from home is still working and that needs to be respected. Thar isn't what's happening.

You keep saying she doesn't get it, but it's impossible *not* to get it. It makes me think it's somehow wilful - that she is resentful or freaked out that you have this requirement and she's deliberately breaking it for reasons I cannot fathom.\n\nI would get the lock, but I would also want to sit down with her and get to the bottom of \"*why* do you keep doing this\".\n\nTechnically ESH.", "NTA, but I would just get a lock and a \"Please Do Not Disturb\" sign.

Her doing this every single time despite your warnings every single time sounds like she is doing this on purpose.

My wife is a stay at home mom. I work from home 3 days a week. It's good because I can help out with the kids and give my wife a break. I leave the door to my office open 80% of the time. I have explained to my wife multiple times that when my door is shut I am in a meeting and I cannot help and I need her to not interrupt me. \n\nShe keeps opening the door to see if I need anything, or to let the kids in to see me, or to take out the garbage. I wait until after my meeting and then I tell her again that if my door is closed I NEED her to leave me alone and keep the kids away from me. She just cant keep it in her head. I told her that I was going to get a lock for the office if she could not understand what it meant when the door is closed. She said I was being mean to her and treating her like a child and that I did not need to lock her out of the office. \n\nI have plants in my office that I take care of so I have a spray bottle that I keep for misting them. So last week I was in a meeting and she came in again to see if I needed anything from the store because she was going grocery shopping with her mom. I asked her politely to close the door because I was in a meeting. She said sorry and closed the door.  My meeting had just finished and she opened the door again. So I sprayed her. She shut the door. Then she called me an asshole for treating her like a misbehaving animal. I asked her if she understood what it meant when my door was closed. She shut up and left with her mom. \n\nSo before I get dogpiled I will clear some stuff up. I work 40 hours a week. I might have my door closed for 8 of those. So on the weekends we take care of everything together. Monday through Friday there are only 8 hours where I need to be left alone. My children know better than to open the door when it is closed. But she just does not get it.\n\nSo now I am at the point where I have given her a choice. I can start spraying her on camera during my meetings, I can get a lock for my door, or I can just go into work in town every day. If I do the last one it means she is stuck in the house all day with the kids because we only have the one car. \n\nI am at my wits end and I feel like an asshole for treating her this way but I do not want to get fired or forced to work at the workplace because I cannot have meetings when I work from home.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
