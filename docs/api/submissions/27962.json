{"id": 27962, "submission_id": "16wecpx", "title": "AITA for calling the non-emergency line on my neighbors kid?", "selftext": "I (25F) live in a new fairly upscale apartment so all the apartments are not filled yet. I have a dog who I take out for walks and thus sometimes interact with my neighbors.\n\nMy neighbor who's name is Becca, I've talked to several times while taking my dog out but otherwise we don't really have a relationship. Becca has a daughter who was really shy so I didn't press her on her name or anything(so we'll call her Sara.) and I've only seen her about half the time I've seen Becca.\n\nAnyway yesterday Becca came to my door and asked if I could watch Sara for the day since she had to go to a meeting in a main town about 2 hours away. I said no. She asked why so I told her I have ADD and I would be too focused on my work. She tried to convince me by saying her daughter would be quiet and just watch TV all day. \n\nSidenote the real reason I didn't want to watch the kid is that I am an awkward person around adults and I'm especially an awkward person around kids because neither of us can read social cues. I also have some shitty childhood parentification trauma so I'm really not a kid person. Lastly I plot out everything I'm going to that day before I get out of bed and the kid would mess that up and while I can deal with that. It ruins my whole day.\n\nI still said no and closed the door and went to work. About an hour later I went to walk my dog and Sara is sitting outside my door. She says her Mom said I would take care of her today. \n\nI'm not totally heartless and i do actually like kids, im just awkward around them. So I let her in my apartment and told her after she washed her hands (I could see some sort of residue on them) she could go sit on my couch. \n\nWhile I was walking my dog I called the non-emergency line and told them that my neighbor abandoned her kid at my apartment. My city is woefully underfunded for police so they said it would be awhile before they sent an officer out since she was currently fine. \n\n\nI went back to my apartment and info-dumped about dogs to a seven(?) Year old for like an hour and then we made cookies before the cops arrived and took my statement and hers and told her it wasn't her fault and all that jazz. Anyway they made some calls and as it turns out Becca has two Moms so they were gonna take her to the other one. \n\nBecca that night came and banged on my door till I opened and then proceeded to yell at me. I'm pretty used to older women yelling at me so I just blocked myself out of it and said okay at the right times in a very neutral tone until one of the aparment guys saw what was happening and got her to back off. \n\nNow I'm wondering if social rules dictated me to take care of her even though I said no; making me the AH in this situation for calling the police? Someone else taped a note to my door criticizing me for breaking up a family and ruining the Moms life and calling me a horrible person.", "created_utc": 1696099172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wecpx/aita_for_calling_the_nonemergency_line_on_my/", "score": 665, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ideologically, I\u2019m very anti calling the cops on our neighbors but what were you supposed to do?! You are under no obligation to watch your neighbor\u2019s kid. You said no, and then she just leaves her kid and tells her you will be watching her?! That\u2019s really negligent parenting and put you in a terrible position. Anyone angry at you over this clearly does not have the whole story. Ignore them. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nAlso, wtf is with people dumping their kids with practical strangers?!", "NTA\n\nthe mother is entitled and irresponsible. She tried to have her daughter looked after by a stranger in a situation that wasn't an emergency (she doesn't know you well enough to be able to trust you with her daughter) AND she left her child alone outside ?  \n\nAnything could have happened to this kid and she spent an hour bored on a bench. It's surprising you didn't find her crying, maybe she's used to being left alone.\n\nYou did the right thing by calling the police, thank you for taking care of the child, you were the only one to behave like an adult in all this.", "NTA - You did _everything_ right.  You're a damn good person.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Becca abandoned her child and the police/social services' response to that is not your problem.\n\nIt sounds like the kid will no longer be under the care of a negligent parent anymore, so if nothing else I think you've done her a favour.", "NTA\n\nI actually read a similar story earlier today on r/BestofRedditorUpdates. Mum abandoned the kid outside her disabled neighbour's flat. The neighbour took the kid in and called the police. The dad, who was going through divorce proceedings, ended up getting full custody. \n\nNo, you did the right thing. Hopefully you saved that girl from being abandoned again in the future.", "This is the third \u201cmy neighbor left their child on my doorstep\u201d story that I have read in 24 hours. Wtf is going on?\n\nNTA", "NTA - Sounds like the kid's other mom might be a better fit for actually caring for her... especially if this is now a split up pair of moms in a custody argument. You calling someone to report this means that the kiddo probably has someone on her side for once while her adults argue with one another.\n\nThanks for being the good person here.", "NTA\n\nNo, social rules don't say that you should have taken care of Sara, social rules say that Sara's mom deserves to have CPS involvement and possibly lose custody for her actions.", "NTA\n\n> I said no. *She asked why*\n\nThat's not a person who understands the limits of social request.  Asking a big favor like that of a stranger is bad enough, but to ask for justification is simply wack.", "NTA.\n\nShe literally left her kid just sitting outside your door after you said you weren't going to watch her. God forbid if that kid had decided to just wander off or if she had gotten abducted because her mother couldn't find proper childcare", "NTA, if she\u2019s willing to abandon her kid like that, the kid isn\u2019t safe with her. Whoever taped the note to your door (assuming it wasn\u2019t Becca herself lol) should have been offering to babysit.", "You are doing great.\nNTA.", "Just adding my NTA, I think everything was already said.\nThe poor girl though being basically abandoned by her mother.", "NTA \nI actually had a similar experience\nI have same kind of traumas and fears. Recently my colleague who I barely know asked me to watch his kid because his ex wife had committed suicide. I couldn't say no due to the situation but I ended up having a melt down because all the childhood trauma was triggered. So I know for a fact that if someone says no to that request it can be for a very strong reason. You did nothing wrong. She put you in a position you had already very clealy said no to. Also I'm jealous of your ability to say no and protect yourself. I wish i had done the same with my colleague's son.", "NTA - Your neighbor was wrong to leave their child behind after you told them you would not be watching them. That is horrible parenting behavior, and she clearly feels you are a pushover and will do it if she forces you in the situation. This will teach her to back off and be a lot more considerate. \n\nI mean if the child would just sit and watch tv all day why cant she sit in her own apartment?\n\nShe should have arranged something with the 2nd mom or with someone she has a closer relationship with.", "Nta.

The note writer (who may just be Becca) could have cared for the child.", "NTA\nShe abandoned her child to a stranger,  what if you hadn't gone outside at all and something happened to the child? What Becca did was beyond unreasonable and getting authorities involved was the beat idea.", "NTA and how much do you want to bet that the note taped to the door was from mom?", "Nta you were correct in calling the police. She abandoned her kid after you said no. \n\nShe didn\u2019t know who she was leaving her kid with so it\u2019s a good life lesson she is learning and the child will be protected in the future hopefully, by her other mom.", "NTA. The mother abandoned her child, outside a closed door. Anything could have happened to the child. The mom was a fool, who deserves whatever the law says is appropriate. A predator, a trafficker could have taken the child; OP didn't know she was there, no one would have missed her for hours. It could have been a tragedy, now it's just paperwork.", "NTA, she literally abandoned her child. I\u2019m sorry for the child, but if she was that ready to just drop her at a strangers house imagine what else that poor kid must deal with.", "NTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t know each other near well enough for her to ask you to watch her child. And if you hadn\u2019t gone out when you did, who knows how long she would\u2019ve sat out there.\nAlso, if you find out who wrote that note, and Becca does get her daughter back, at least you found someone to watch the child for her. Assuming Becca herself didn\u2019t post that note.", "Wow, shouldn't the mother be charged for child abandonment or neglect?\n\nOP is NTA\n\nYou should also report this and the harassment to apt manager. This will not get better for you, OP.", "No get a ppo", "NTA you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were already generous to let the kid in.", "The fuck was this woman thinking dumping her child with someone who said no?!  Absolutely insane.  NTA.", "NTA. Becca has issues. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s dumped this poor kid, I\u2019d just about guarantee that. Hopefully the other mother is sane. Either way, none of this is your fault. You said \u201cno,\u201d you were not obligated to give her a reason. She was wildly out of line. \nHad this been an actual emergency, if she was being wheeled out in an ambulance or something, then I\u2019d say you should extend yourself to help a neighbor in need. But this was just a person who didn\u2019t schedule her time well. That\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA\n\nBut, when she first asked, I'd have made up a story about being not permitted to be around children under the age of 16 by court order, and I did not want to violate my parole.", "NTA what if you had not opened your door again all day!?\n\nSomeone could have taken the little girl. She could have been left sitting there alone all day. That sort of mother does not deserve to have a child. You saved her from a shitty parent", "It\u2019s not socially acceptable for this woman to even ask you, a person she just met, to watch her kid.

Only a very negligent parent would \n1 leave a young child at a neighbors door\n2 Lie to the child promising the neighbor agreed to watch the child \n3 not notify the neighbor the child was waiting \n4 not leave contact information in case of emergency \n\nBecca is now likely in the care of the other mom, who truly wants Becca and accepts parental responsibility.  Becca is safe and cared for.  The other mom is probably grateful that someone finally reported her ex for neglect so that she can keep Becca safe and loved.  You are a hero to that little girl and her other mom!", "She didn't even know if you were home! That child could have been sitting out there all day alone! And then if somebody noticed and called the police you would have been in trouble too until they could figure out what happened! You would have at the very least been questioned by the police! At no point does anybody with a child think it's okay to drop them off in front of somebody's house that said they will not watch them and just leave! Nta and you didn't break up their family or ruin the mom's life, she did! She just thought you were going to roll over and put up with it, and thankfully you didn't! If she's willing to do this to the daughter, what else does she do?", "That Mom deserved to \u201c have her life ruined \u201c.", "> She asked why so I told her I have ADD and I would be too focused on my work.\n\nTactical error. She was asking why so she could argue with you. If you weren't going to change your mind you should not have given her a reason. She doesn't need a reason. The reason is \"Because I'm not going to do that under any circumstances, go away now\".\n\nNTA. You can't just strand a kid at somebody else's house.", "NTA.  She had no right to dump her kid at your place.  No means no.  She asked you to babysit, you said no.  She dropped the kid at your place any way without you knowing she was going to be there.  You'd have been right to call the emergency line.  Tape a note to your door saying that you are not running a day care center.\nIt is absolutely outrageous that someone you barely knew ditched their kid at your doorstep!  This has nothing to do with ADD, social cues, awkwardness or anything else.  No is a complete sentence.  You said you didn't want to babysit, that should have been the end of the story.", "NTA", "NTA. You specifically told her you WOULDNT watch her kid. Did she not know what that meant?", "NTA! You said no, that\u2019s all that matters. She chose to ignore your answer and lied to her child, then abandoned her. You\u2019re 100% NOT responsible for the choice she made and it was very kind of you to let her daughter in.", "she abandoned her child and you are at fault?? ugh\n\nNTA", "No social rules require you to watch someone's child when you tell them no. Leaving a child on someone's porch without telling them is child abandonment. You did the right thing.", "You are not the terrible person here, you did the right thing and NTA.", "OMG you did NOTHING WRONG!!!! Becca doesn\u2019t know you from Adam, for all she knew you could be a serial killer. She abandoned her child on your doorstep and didn\u2019t even let you know the girl was there! The police was exactly the right call to make. Thank God you are a decent human being. Becca needs to have a paid vacation in the Gray Bar Hotel for child endangerment.", "NTA", "NTA! It is totally not OK to leave your child with someone you barely know after you've told them no. And to just leave her outside your door? \n\nYou did better than I would have. I'd have let her watch whatever she wanted on TV while I worked. No cookies from me.", "NTA -- What if you were a pedophile or something!? This mom's entitlement and frankly brazen endangerment of her own kid is astounding to me.\n\nI'm not saying the kid was in any danger from you, of course, but mom doesn't know that for sure. What kind of person leaves a child with a neighbour they barely know, especially AFTER you said NO. The mom is the AH and the kid is obviously better off with mom #2.\n\nyou did the right thing.", "NTA. You said no, twice. She literally abandoned her kid at your doorstep. You did the right thing. The note was probably left by her or a friend of hers acting on her behalf.", "Next time call CPS. Becca abandoned her child and is a shit parent for doing so. Also, you don\u2019t ever have to justify why you say \u201cno\u201d to someone. NTA", "OP clearly has some problems, but being an AH is not one of them.  On the upside, she'll likely not get bothered by anyone in the building again.", "NTA and this would have definitely continued to happen.  She is a negligent mother and her kid deserves a life with a responsible parent.", "NTA\nShe abandoned her child. Luckily with someone that wasn't going to harm her, and you did the right thing.", "NTA. She tried to force you to babysit. It sounds like she doesn't know you well. I get that she had meeting... but she would have been better off with a babysitting service and it sounds like a random sitter wouldn't have been much less familiar than you with her daughter. Who knows how long the kid was outside your door. She's probably better off with her other mom.", "NTA at all. She (the mother) is very lucky that getting the police involved was all that happened. No is a complete sentence. Also, the mother didn\u2019t know your contact info or anything. You could have been someone who would sell a child to a trafficker, and she would have had no proof that you even opened the door, thus a good alibi. Becca is guilty of child abandonment, full stop.", "OP keeps mentioning areas she feels are lacking but she handled this with finesse .", "Also if OP hadn\u2019t called then I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve happened again. And again. And again.", "Plus if Mom had gotten away with it one time it may happen again.  Might not even check if OP is there first before leaving the kid. Better to take care of it now.", "Do you have a link to that post?", "I\u02bbve noticed this sub follows patterns.\n\nYou\u02bbll see the same theme repeatedly posted within a day.", "And this one is almost verbatim another I read \ud83d\ude44", "There was one on BORU today and usually you see repeats whenever those go up.", "99.9% of these are fake (but entertaining), so the authors find what tics and write stories about it.", "I feel awful for Sara. Makes me wonder if she is also that shy when with her other parent, or if she is just in survival mode with this one.", "there's several AITA stories on this subject, so it either happens frightfully frequently or people are posting various versions for the updoots.", "or her mom", ">You smack of a sad amount of lack of kindness, empathy, flexibility, civility, social-mindedness, and more. Do better. Don\u2019t hide behind your generation or your upbringing or whatever.\n\n\n\nYou lie. \n\nA woman is that careless she abandons her child on a new neighbor's doorstep after receiving a clear no? And you talk all this crap about Op. \n\nDo better. \n\nOp isn't hiding behind anything. You are hiding behind words to preach self righteousness and often those who preach don't do. \n\n\n>I hope you never have kids\n\nOp is the kind of person to have them. She knows she wouldn't be abandoning them, unlike you and this mother.", "Or what if OP never left the apartment that day? Would the kid have just quietly sat in the hallway all day with no supervision??", "It's kinda funny to watch the themes change day by day. Certain ones are boring such as most wedding ones and MIL + Allergy ones are pretty mid.", "I'm trying to figure out why \"points\" matter? You mean like karma? I delete my profile every time I hit 40,000 karma and make a new one. In a forum that allows an even encourages throwaway accounts why do people care?", "The other day it was bad baby names.", "What's the point of deleting at 40,000?", "Oh my god bad baby names are so funny"]}
