{"id": 27962, "submission_id": "16wecpx", "title": "AITA for calling the non-emergency line on my neighbors kid?", "selftext": "I (25F) live in a new fairly upscale apartment so all the apartments are not filled yet. I have a dog who I take out for walks and thus sometimes interact with my neighbors.\n\nMy neighbor who's name is Becca, I've talked to several times while taking my dog out but otherwise we don't really have a relationship. Becca has a daughter who was really shy so I didn't press her on her name or anything(so we'll call her Sara.) and I've only seen her about half the time I've seen Becca.\n\nAnyway yesterday Becca came to my door and asked if I could watch Sara for the day since she had to go to a meeting in a main town about 2 hours away. I said no. She asked why so I told her I have ADD and I would be too focused on my work. She tried to convince me by saying her daughter would be quiet and just watch TV all day. \n\nSidenote the real reason I didn't want to watch the kid is that I am an awkward person around adults and I'm especially an awkward person around kids because neither of us can read social cues. I also have some shitty childhood parentification trauma so I'm really not a kid person. Lastly I plot out everything I'm going to that day before I get out of bed and the kid would mess that up and while I can deal with that. It ruins my whole day.\n\nI still said no and closed the door and went to work. About an hour later I went to walk my dog and Sara is sitting outside my door. She says her Mom said I would take care of her today. \n\nI'm not totally heartless and i do actually like kids, im just awkward around them. So I let her in my apartment and told her after she washed her hands (I could see some sort of residue on them) she could go sit on my couch. \n\nWhile I was walking my dog I called the non-emergency line and told them that my neighbor abandoned her kid at my apartment. My city is woefully underfunded for police so they said it would be awhile before they sent an officer out since she was currently fine. \n\n\nI went back to my apartment and info-dumped about dogs to a seven(?) Year old for like an hour and then we made cookies before the cops arrived and took my statement and hers and told her it wasn't her fault and all that jazz. Anyway they made some calls and as it turns out Becca has two Moms so they were gonna take her to the other one. \n\nBecca that night came and banged on my door till I opened and then proceeded to yell at me. I'm pretty used to older women yelling at me so I just blocked myself out of it and said okay at the right times in a very neutral tone until one of the aparment guys saw what was happening and got her to back off. \n\nNow I'm wondering if social rules dictated me to take care of her even though I said no; making me the AH in this situation for calling the police? Someone else taped a note to my door criticizing me for breaking up a family and ruining the Moms life and calling me a horrible person.", "created_utc": 1696099172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wecpx/aita_for_calling_the_nonemergency_line_on_my/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ideologically, I\u2019m very anti calling the cops on our neighbors but what were you supposed to do?! You are under no obligation to watch your neighbor\u2019s kid. You said no, and then she just leaves her kid and tells her you will be watching her?! That\u2019s really negligent parenting and put you in a terrible position. Anyone angry at you over this clearly does not have the whole story. Ignore them. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nAlso, wtf is with people dumping their kids with practical strangers?!", "NTA\n\nthe mother is entitled and irresponsible. She tried to have her daughter looked after by a stranger in a situation that wasn't an emergency (she doesn't know you well enough to be able to trust you with her daughter) AND she left her child alone outside ?  \n\nAnything could have happened to this kid and she spent an hour bored on a bench. It's surprising you didn't find her crying, maybe she's used to being left alone.\n\nYou did the right thing by calling the police, thank you for taking care of the child, you were the only one to behave like an adult in all this.", "NTA - You did _everything_ right.  You're a damn good person.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Becca abandoned her child and the police/social services' response to that is not your problem.\n\nIt sounds like the kid will no longer be under the care of a negligent parent anymore, so if nothing else I think you've done her a favour.", "NTA\n\nI actually read a similar story earlier today on r/BestofRedditorUpdates. Mum abandoned the kid outside her disabled neighbour's flat. The neighbour took the kid in and called the police. The dad, who was going through divorce proceedings, ended up getting full custody. \n\nNo, you did the right thing. Hopefully you saved that girl from being abandoned again in the future.", "This is the third \u201cmy neighbor left their child on my doorstep\u201d story that I have read in 24 hours. Wtf is going on?\n\nNTA", "NTA - Sounds like the kid's other mom might be a better fit for actually caring for her... especially if this is now a split up pair of moms in a custody argument. You calling someone to report this means that the kiddo probably has someone on her side for once while her adults argue with one another.\n\nThanks for being the good person here.", "NTA\n\nNo, social rules don't say that you should have taken care of Sara, social rules say that Sara's mom deserves to have CPS involvement and possibly lose custody for her actions.", "NTA\n\n> I said no. *She asked why*\n\nThat's not a person who understands the limits of social request.  Asking a big favor like that of a stranger is bad enough, but to ask for justification is simply wack.", "NTA.\n\nShe literally left her kid just sitting outside your door after you said you weren't going to watch her. God forbid if that kid had decided to just wander off or if she had gotten abducted because her mother couldn't find proper childcare", "NTA, if she\u2019s willing to abandon her kid like that, the kid isn\u2019t safe with her. Whoever taped the note to your door (assuming it wasn\u2019t Becca herself lol) should have been offering to babysit.", "You are doing great.\nNTA.", "Just adding my NTA, I think everything was already said.\nThe poor girl though being basically abandoned by her mother.", "NTA \nI actually had a similar experience\nI have same kind of traumas and fears. Recently my colleague who I barely know asked me to watch his kid because his ex wife had committed suicide. I couldn't say no due to the situation but I ended up having a melt down because all the childhood trauma was triggered. So I know for a fact that if someone says no to that request it can be for a very strong reason. You did nothing wrong. She put you in a position you had already very clealy said no to. Also I'm jealous of your ability to say no and protect yourself. I wish i had done the same with my colleague's son.", "NTA - Your neighbor was wrong to leave their child behind after you told them you would not be watching them. That is horrible parenting behavior, and she clearly feels you are a pushover and will do it if she forces you in the situation. This will teach her to back off and be a lot more considerate. \n\nI mean if the child would just sit and watch tv all day why cant she sit in her own apartment?\n\nShe should have arranged something with the 2nd mom or with someone she has a closer relationship with.", "Nta. You said no, what if you had gone out? She'd expect her daughter to sit outside all day...", "You absolutely did the right thing calling the police. No responsible mother would leave her child at a stranger\u2019s front door?! \n\nWhoever left the note is the ah and should have volunteered to watch the little girl if they are so invested in keeping the family intact! NTA", "NTA. Nope, not at all. She asked, you said no. Then she abandoned her child with a near stranger who had explicitly said no. The note writer (who may just be Becca) could have cared for the child.", "NTA\nShe abandoned her child to a stranger,  what if you hadn't gone outside at all and something happened to the child? What Becca did was beyond unreasonable and getting authorities involved was the beat idea.", "NTA and how much do you want to bet that the note taped to the door was from mom?", "Nta you were correct in calling the police. She abandoned her kid after you said no. \n\nShe didn\u2019t know who she was leaving her kid with so it\u2019s a good life lesson she is learning and the child will be protected in the future hopefully, by her other mom.", "NTA. The mother abandoned her child, outside a closed door. Anything could have happened to the child. The mom was a fool, who deserves whatever the law says is appropriate. A predator, a trafficker could have taken the child; OP didn't know she was there, no one would have missed her for hours. It could have been a tragedy, now it's just paperwork.", "NTA, she literally abandoned her child. I\u2019m sorry for the child, but if she was that ready to just drop her at a strangers house imagine what else that poor kid must deal with.", "NTA. It sounds like you don\u2019t know each other near well enough for her to ask you to watch her child. And if you hadn\u2019t gone out when you did, who knows how long she would\u2019ve sat out there.\nAlso, if you find out who wrote that note, and Becca does get her daughter back, at least you found someone to watch the child for her. Assuming Becca herself didn\u2019t post that note.", "Wow, shouldn't the mother be charged for child abandonment or neglect?\n\nOP is NTA\n\nYou should also report this and the harassment to apt manager. This will not get better for you, OP.", "No get a ppo", "NTA you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were already generous to let the kid in.", "The fuck was this woman thinking dumping her child with someone who said no?!  Absolutely insane.  NTA.", "NTA. Becca has issues. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s dumped this poor kid, I\u2019d just about guarantee that. Hopefully the other mother is sane. Either way, none of this is your fault. You said \u201cno,\u201d you were not obligated to give her a reason. She was wildly out of line. \nHad this been an actual emergency, if she was being wheeled out in an ambulance or something, then I\u2019d say you should extend yourself to help a neighbor in need. But this was just a person who didn\u2019t schedule her time well. That\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA\n\nBut, when she first asked, I'd have made up a story about being not permitted to be around children under the age of 16 by court order, and I did not want to violate my parole.", "NTA what if you had not opened your door again all day!?\n\nSomeone could have taken the little girl. She could have been left sitting there alone all day. That sort of mother does not deserve to have a child. You saved her from a shitty parent", "It\u2019s not socially acceptable for this woman to even ask you, a person she just met, to watch her kid. It\u2019s even less socially acceptable to abandon the kid outside your door.\n\nCalling the police was the only answer, and her coming to the door screaming should have been another call.

Like some other commenters have said, I'm not the type of person to jump immediately to involving the police, but this woman literally abandoned a child with you. I'm sure it didn't feel nice to have to do, but I think you made all of the right calls there, and probably also made the experience as easy as it could have been on the poor kid.
