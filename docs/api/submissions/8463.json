If you can afford a mini-fridge, get one and bring it in when he's not home so he doesn't know you have it and buy a lock. Keep your food in there.

It's Monday and I want it for Wednesday\", meant that it was hands off that whole time.

I think we need to, because he's not understanding it enough all separately.", "Yep. Do an intervention.\n\nBiggest thing, you need to have an agreed upon punishment. That he has to drive to the store, get the material, and make a better replacement. Or more easily, pay 10x the cost of the stuff. Drank $4 milk? No prob, $40 please. Eat $8 labeled sandwich, no prob, $80 please.\n\nOtherwise you're a free UeberEats.", "Oh, he understands, he just doesn't care.

OP, google \u201crefrigerator lock box\u201d and order something that looks like it will work for your fridge and lock your stuff in it.", "Tell him to buy his own fridge and lock up the main one. \n\nMy mom had to lock up ours when she let a friend of hers and her 2 teen kids move in (this was back in 79). They brought their own fridge and it was in the garage,  plugged up and working and their food in it, but they kept eating our food.  My mom would tell her friend that our fridge was ours and their fridge was theirs. We weren't allowed to, \nand didn't,  go into their fridge. When my mom would cook, she'd cook enough for everyone and when her friend cooked,  she'd do the same.  My mom finally had enough when the food she put together for her lunches (she worked overnights) was missing when she went to take it out to take to work.  Next day when I got home from school,  I saw a chain around the fridge and freezer handles and it was locked to a hinge thing screwed into the counter right next to the fridge. Problem solved \ud83d\ude02\n\nTelling them for a month was all she could stand and she took drastic measures lol. She gave us each the combination and that was that. \n\nGood luck!\n\n****Edited to add NTA", "NTA\n\nBut he is either a massive inconsiderate jerk who doesn't care and is selfish or he genuinely has an eating problem? Does he smoke a lot of weed, sometimes people who smoke literally can't help themselves when they have the munchies and just eat like crazy.", "NTA.  \n\n\nOf course he'll start an argument.  Because the system is currently working great for him.  He eats whatever he wants.  Nobody eats his stuff.  Who wouldn't like that?  \n\n\nHonestly, the problem should've been nipped a LOT sooner.  Like a decade ago.", "NTA\n\nGet a fridge lock and give everyone but him a key", "Better yet: put a lock on the family fridge. Everyone gets a key but him. He can buy himself a mini fridge for his food.", "yeah ramp it up because there's no pesky HR.  hot peppers imo.", "He is absolutely understanding, what he is doing is disobeying.", "He doesn\u2019t want to understand. Personally, I would go nuclear at this point. Get a mini fridge for your food and lock it. Optional: To be extra petty, eat his stuff for a week or two (if you dare) and if he accuses you, either deny it or DARVO him and ask what a repeated food thief would know about boundaries. Eventually he will understand your complaints better when put in your shoes", "I'd also charge him for it. The meal cost $12 and half was left? $6 please! Keep the receipt and highlight the item. Take a picture for yourself for a record. \n\nHe understands and he just doesn't care. It only bothers him when people do it to him. You may not get the money but you will make a point."]}
