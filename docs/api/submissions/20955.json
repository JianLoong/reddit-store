As you said, it's not like he can't eat anything there, he just doesn't want to try. You're not telling him to become vegan, it's just one meal. \n\nI have a vegetarian friend who I go out to eat with regularly. We often go to places that do share plate dining and we always order all vegetarian dishes. Would I like to try some meat dishes? Yes. But we can share more if we just stick to vegetarian. It wouldn't matter to me if she was vegan, it's like at most once a month that I'll have to 'restrict' my diet. That's what good friends do. If he can't inconvenience himself this one time for you for your birthday, is he even a good friend?\n\nAnd anyone saying 'would you take a vegan to a meat only restaurant?', well that argument is only valid if the person is strictly carnivore. Most people eat meat, veggies, carbs so taking someone to a vegan restaurant doesn't mean they can't eat anything. Taking a carnivore to a vegan restaurant would mean they can't eat anything. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your birthday, he offered and you accepted. End of story as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm not vegan personally, but I always find vegan/vegetarian restaurants to be very creative.", "NTA - he offered and told you to pick the restaurant and you did. Unless he has allergies to all vegan food somehow he can find something to eat there. Vegans and vegetarians always have to settle for the few things on the menu (if that) they can eat when going out somewhere \"everyone\" can eat. Also he's being a dick trying to take it back or trying to change the restaurant to something he wants when he literally told you to pick AND it's your birthday.", "NTA   \n\n\nwhat an idiot. \"i cant have vegan food!\" what does that even mean? its YOUR birthday! get those vegan foods. i love vegan food! Oreos! yum! lol", "Omg so NTA. Why did he even give you an option to pick. A lot of plant based restaurants have terrific menu options. It\u2019s sound like he won\u2019t even entertain the thought. It\u2019s your birthday it\u2019s your choice. How do you normally eat around your friend? For this to be in a friend zone relationship it doesn\u2019t sound equal at all.", "sorry for posting twice my first post i believe was deleted", "NTA. It's your birthday. He sounds like a big baby.", "NTA, your friend is being really rude", "NTA. He offeref to take you to a restaurant of YOUR choice for YOUR birthday... and then says he \"can't\" eat vegan food?\nI'm not a vegan, I enjoy meat, but that poor man must suffer from a very specific condition that makes you unable to eat anything but meat. Truly horrible. Guy is probably a cat.\n\nNo, for real, he's an AH for that reaction and this is not in any way your fault.\nHe can just go there and eat fries or something, vegan doesn't mean they only have salad and raw tomatoes.", "NTA...I just made a birthday post too. There is a ton of vegan food that is delicious.

Very rude to tell you to pick a restaurant and then make you feel lousy about your choice. Of course non-vegans can eat vegan food. If he wasn't an AH he might even be supportive of your diet and interested to learn more about it and try it himself for a night. You shouldn't feel bad AT ALL and honestly I would cancel the dinner date altogether because he sounds like a major AH. Show him my post so he understands why you're cancelling. Friends support friends, they don't make them feel bad about something like this. Ditch that lame friend.", "NTA. Why, supposedly, can he not eat there? \nAnd also, does he do stuff like this a lot?

He needs to grow up.", "NTA. Your friend sounds like one though. It won't kill him to eat at a vegan restaurant for one meal.

I can\u2019t fathom a single reason why he can\u2019t just chill out and eat some vegetables or tofu for his close friend. Like you said, he isn\u2019t allergic. There is nothing preventing him from trying some vegan food for a night. No, you are NTA. Your friend is being an inconsiderate jerk.", "NTA - even if it wasn\u2019t your birthday there is absolutely nothing wrong with suggesting a vegan restaurant. I have omnivore friends who don\u2019t mind eating a vegan meal every once in a while. If someone can\u2019t go a single meal without meat they are actually just a weirdo", "You're NTA for picking a restaurant you want to go to for your birthday. He's being weird. If he doesn't want to eat there, he should just say that. It's not fair on him to ask you to pick a place and then say that just because he can't order meat there, it's not somewhere he can eat. Most people can eat plant based foods (although I know some coeliacs who will avoid vegan places because of the high amount of gluten used in many mock meats).\n\nYou shouldn't feel bad about picking somewhere you want to go to. If he's not willing to even try the menu, it's perfectly reasonable that you would feel disappointed and hurt by that.\n\nIt's good that he's trying to find a compromise, but you're NTA for feeling hurt.", "NTA. Your good friend doesn't comprehend the meaning of friendship, not what it means to be gracious. If he had stipulations, he should have mentioned them when he made his offer, rather than scold you for assuming he actually meant what he said. \ud83d\ude44 Nice friend. And great way to ruin what you thought was going to be a special birthday treat. \n\nI can't help but wonder what would happen, when your good friend's birthday comes around and you tell him to pick any restaurant he wants, would he be so gracious towards your preferences as he expects you to be towards him?  Or would he choose some Brazilian steakhouse, like Fogo De Minas, and expect you to pick one or 2 side dishes to eat with him?", "I don\u2019t think what you wanted was unreasonable. He did offer. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Look for a new friend, this guy can\u2019t endure a meal without meat so their friend for once gets to eat anything on the menu, not just the one salad or limited entree. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what a real gift is.\n\nI hope you make new friends who can appreciate more food options and go on some vegan adventures with you!", "YTA\n\nThere's never a justifiable reason to pick restaurants that literally restrict what's on the menu. \n\nI wouldn't ask a vegan friend to strictly a meat place, I expect my vegan friends to pick places that entertain all of our diets.\n\nWhat is the deal with Vegans showing up on this Reddit feeling entitled to forcing their diet down other people's throats?", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong for choosing a restaurant you were excited about. I\u2019m sorry your friend let you down.   \n\nPerhaps he\u2019s having a hard time spending his money on a meal he doesn\u2019t think he will enjoy and believes you would enjoy a vegan meal at a meat serving restaurant just as much as he would enjoy his meal?  \n\nIt\u2019s hard for people like me who view the meat as the main part of the meal to give that up. It\u2019s like we aren\u2019t satisfied without the meat. \n\nI don\u2019t think your friend understands how hurt you are and that every time you go out to a regular restaurant it\u2019s difficult for you to find food to enjoy.", "nta...gl finding a restyrant.. its best to find a place you both can get into if you can...even if you did go to that vegan place, do you want to see your friend pout?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

THATS WHAT A MENU IS!", "I think a lot of people that aren\u2019t familiar with vegan or vegetarian diets don\u2019t realize that many places have very few options that work with a vegan or vegetarian diet and offer balanced nutrition. Like, if you go to McDonald\u2019s, sure you can get fries, but that\u2019s not a *meal*, you\u2019d have to supplement it with another meal somewhere else to get all your nutrients. And this is one of very few options that are even acceptable with the diet - you could also get apple slices or something but if there\u2019s no plant-based protein option you can\u2019t really make a meal out of it. Plant-based diets doesn\u2019t just mean people don\u2019t eat meat, they have to replace those nutrients with something else.\n\nEven with dining it is easy to go to places that have many \u201cvegetarian\u201d or \u201cvegan\u201d options that are just kind of removing nutrients and replacing them with nothing. Hell, you go to of those salad bar places and ask to replace the chicken with tofu, and they\u2019ll charge you extra. Then somewhere adds a plant-based meat option and people flip out (why?). Most people I know with plant-based diets eat out so little because places generally are geared toward meat-based diets, and it\u2019s a relief for vegetarians or vegans to go to a place with many options for them. So if you have friends with dietary restrictions, the least you can do is let them pick a place on their *birthday* that will give them (and you) many food options to choose from that conform to everyone\u2019s dietary needs.\n\nTLDR: Most restaurants have very little (or even zero) nutritionally viable options for vegetarians and vegans, and you eating one plant-based meal every once in a while is a trivial burden, probably not a big deal to eat at a vegan restaurant for your friend\u2019s birthday.
