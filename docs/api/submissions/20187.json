We met and fell in love, we lived in opposite ends of the country but we made it work. He works mainly from home doing music related projects. He has a somewhat steady income that is far less than mine which i do not mind at all. I have a really good position and pay to keep us comfortable.\r  \nMy boyfriend moved in with me about 6 months ago, he has been so helpful and attentive to me. He prioritizes our living space first, the apartment is always clean, he drives me to work, brings me lunch whenever I ask, picks me up from work, has dinner cooked, my cat well cared for and so on. It's been such a blessing for me.\r  \nSo onto the issue, my family is very old fashioned and very much all about \"the man brings home the money and the woman stays in the kitchen\", it's such a tired old mentality which has no room in todays landscape and especially my life!\r  \nAbout a week ago I was talking to my mother on the phone and just telling her how everything has been going with me and my boyfriend since he's moved in, I couldnt help but gush about him and all he's done for me. She was a bit confused and asked if he was looking for a job and I explained to her that he had comissions and so fourth with his work, but that I was the overall breadwinner. She was a bit quiet and said \"well if that makes you happy\" and changed the subject.\r  \nTwo days ago my mother called me and we talked like usual and while on call I could hear my older brother in the back being his usual self, loud and obnoxious, he's very immature for his age and spends most of his time at my parents house (he doesnt live there). He suddenly grabbs the phone from our mother and asked how I and the \"girlfriend\" were doing. I paused feeling confused, then asked what he meant with \"my girlfriend\". He laughed out loud as if proud of himself then he answered with \"yea that little bit\\*h who stays home and cleans up after you\", I could hear others in the background laughing, assuming it was my dad amongst them. I told him that it was none of his business how we lived and to mind his own and stop being an a\\*s. He wouldnt drop it so I got angry and told him to worry about his kids that he never see's and the child support he never pays. This was a sensitive subject that I knew darn well everyone else avoided brining up around him. He began going off on me calling me every name in the book and throwing insults at my boyfriend as well. I stayed calm and even laughed a bit (not entirely proud of) which got him more mad. He hung up on me and soon after my mother messaged me telling me that I was out of line for going off on my brother. I told her that he should have backed off, they're being cold and distant from me. I have never really been super close to them but still like for them to be apart of my life. Should I apologize? Was I out of line? My boyfriend is fully supportive of me and thinks I should do whatever makes me feel happy and content but I just dont know what that is.", "created_utc": 1687293066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14em9hc/aita_if28_for_going_off_on_my_older_brotherm34/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have NOTHING to be sorry for. That was an epic response. EPIC! Your family are a bunch of assholes. They basically let your brother crap all over your life and laughed and laughed and laughed, and when you fought back, they got mad at you. People like your brother are literally the reason we have that old adage, \"He can dish it out, but he can't take it.\" Also, \"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,\" comes to mind. I'd suggest telling them that the topic is off limits, and if your brother (or anyone for that matter) goes off again, they will receive the exact same treatment in response.", "NTA obviously.\n\nThere's clear favouritism going on. Your brother is allowed to insult your lifestyle and partner unprovoked, but when the shoe is on the other foot he can't take it. Your parents are no better.\n\nOutside of your family's outdated and bullying attitude towards your lifestyle, do you actually like being around them? Or do you feel obligated to keep them a part of your life because they are family? Food for thought.", "NTA\n\nDo NOT apologize. Your brother was projecting his own insecurities, considering he isn't supporting his own family, and realized that he isn't a \"man\" by his own standards. All you did was hold up a mirror for him.", "NTA. Tell your brother that maybe he could keep a woman if he was more like your bf. No joke go low or no contact with those toxic masculinity pushers.", ">I stayed calm and even laughed a bit (not entirely proud of) which got him more mad. \n\nIf you aren't proud of yourself, I am.

Not everyone wishes you happiness however you may find it. They mean well but it's none of their business and clearly sharing with one family member will be shared with all in a degrading way. It speaks to the amount of respect they have for you as well as your boyfriend.", "Your brother is a child.  NTA.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like he not only deserved your comments for his actions, but he was being incredibly nasty and needed to be checked.\n\nWith that said I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that it is pretty unusual for any 20 something year old childless couple to maintain a stay at home spouse. You do what works for you, but it always raises my curiosity a bit whenever I hear that kind of dynamic regardless of what sex is staying home", "NTA.\n\nYou haven\u2019t told us the full dynamics of your brother\u2019s situation, nor should you. There may be something you know that would say YTA a bit for the way you told him off, but he was being AH and a misogynist and needed to be told off.\n\nAlso good on you and your boyfriend. It takes strong people to not bow to narrow minded societal pressure. I hope you have a long strong relationship.", "NTA.  You\u2019re brother crossed the line. You responded in kind and he couldn\u2019t take it.  The fact that your mom only addressed your comment and not your brother\u2019s means that you\u2019re not going to get any support from them for your BF.", "NTA. Read all the other comments. Now ask yourself why would you want anyone like that in your life? You may not be able to choose your relatives but you damn sure can choose your family. \nBlood don't make family. You don't owe that imbecile a thing and Mom owes YOU an apology for defending him.", "NTA and you did right giving your brother a reality check.", "NTA whys the favorite kid always the loser", "NTA    people who live in glass houses, should not throw stones. \n\nIt's amazing to me that there are multiple posts a day, that ask the same thing. Why does every decent person think they are an asshole, for pushing back? Because the answer, every time, is NO! \n\nYou and your boyfriend have a dynamic that works for both of you, it's nobody's business to make unwanted, unnecessary, unhelpful, and just plain rude comments. \n\nDo not apologize! It makes it seem like their comments are correct, and they aren't. If they keep pressing you to apologize, go NC with the lot of them.", "NTA, please don't apologize to those ****s.

Your mom said you were out of line for telling the truth but he's *not* out of line for insulting you and your bf? Just no.", "NTA but consider whether or not bragging about your stay at home boyfriend to your family is the best idea.  Your family doesn\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t work, especially when there is no reason to stay home, like having kids at home.  Staying at home to take care of his girlfriend so he doesn\u2019t have to work is kind of a weak position to be in, and probably the less you share with your family the better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
