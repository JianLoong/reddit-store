I wasn't so hot on the idea of going to a resort with my in-law family but we came to an agreement to be there as two different group and only do some activities together so both groups wouldn't have to skip on things they wanted to do on behalf of the other.  \n\nOne of the resort activity was horse riding. You have to be a group of at least 4 persons, or you can join a group of random people. At the stable we were informed that my SIL and MIL would not be allowed to ride horses due to their weight. While they are aware they're both above an ideal weight, they do entertain a certain level of delusion towards their actual size. They threw a huge fit which, IMHO, was handled very well by the manager. \n\nMeanwhile I was booking my ride along with my SO ride. Hearing his mother and sister yelling he went to investigate. He come back to tell me we're going back to the hotel as his mother and sister were furious of being called \"fat\". I had just paid for our ride and was about to go pick my horse. The employee told me she could refund us both, or just his ride. I really wanted to go a horseback ride so I told my SO I was going. Two groups were getting ready so a stablehand inquired on my behalf if any group wanted to take a lone rider. I ended up with two unrelated couples. The ride was awesome, our guide was very funny and entertaining, the two couples were lovely and we had a really nice time together that made the whole time pass in the blink of an eye. \n\nI came back to the resort to my SO sulking in our room. His mother and sister teared him a new hole because I went on the ride instead of \"standing in solidarity with them\" and he was taking it out on me. We had a huge argument about how we agreed to not do everything together, he claimed I hated his family and ruined our \"family vacation\". The next morning he apologized for his reaction but still maintain that it was really shitty of me to go on the ride on my own seeing how they insulted his mother and sister. But from what I overheard from my side of the barn the manager handled it very diplomatically and in a very non-judgemental way, he explain it was out of concerns to the welfare of the animals and suggested other activities held at the stables they could do, even gave them free voucher for them. [Pony riding lesson for nephew, petting zoo, carriage ride]. I did apologize for the argument we had but I didn't apologize for going on the ride. It's no fault of mine and I don't see why I shouldn't do something just because my SIL and MIL cannot do it. \n\nWe've been back over a week now and my SO is still butthurt about it. My SIL and MIL haven't talked to me since and when they call my SO he goes in another room so I don't overhear him.\n\nEdit : showed my SO this thread last evening. He admitted he over reacted, he was already stressed out at the resort. While he loves his family and was missing them he's the first to admit going on a 10 day trip with them was a bad idea, he knows how they are. They were quite demanding in his/our attention during the trip and he was torn between just wanting some goddamn space but also factoring he didn't saw them in 3 years and did missed them he said it was just overwhelming trying to deal with those conflicting emotions. Over all he didn't care I went on the ride, at the stables he just wanted out, he was just fucking done with the whole trip, their tantrum the straw that broke the camel's back so to speak. We've been together 15 years, I know him and that's not how he usually is, I can see in hindsight the tension he was under but didn't realize at the moment just how fed up he was. As for MIL and SIL, before the pandemic we usually saw them once or twice per year, only a couple days each time. Our relationship was always warm and cordial. We never stayed with them nor they ever stayed with us, we always book hotels as neither of our places has enough room to host the others. They live on the other side of the country, they're not a presence in our daily lives.

They didn't \"insult\" his family if it was unsafe for them to ride.", "NTA. I worked at an amusement park and I daily had to inform larger guests that they couldn\u2019t ride. Either weight limit or the safety restraints wouldn\u2019t fit correctly. It\u2019s common sense. Horses can only support  so much weight on their backs. Plus if they\u2019re that heavy how the hell would they get on or off their horses. \n\n\nOne of my siblings and their spouses are very obese. It\u2019s something my sister struggles with and she\u2019s lost weight and gained it back. She at least tries. My BIL is huge, he makes no effort to change. It\u2019s gotten to the point where he damages furniture. When it comes to family vacations, I don\u2019t let his limitations stop me from what I want to do. And it\u2019s gotten to the point where I have no sympathy for problems caused by his weight anymore. It\u2019s self inflicted.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve portrayed this accurately, the women weren\u2019t \u201cinsulted\u201d\u2026 The manager simply stated facts to take care of the animals.

Do they know that making a horse carrying excessive weight will severely hurt them? Or are they just concerned about their hurt feelings?", "NTA, putting a large person on a horse can injure it.  They weren't being called fat, they're just too heavy for the horses.  Just because they couldn't go doesn't mean you should have chucked your ride.  Your SO should have joined as well.  Just because you were on vacation together doesn't mean you were chained at the hip.", "NTA at all. You stood in solidarity with the poor horses. They couldn't choose which butt was going to sit on him. It's same as a child throwing a tantrum because he's  too short or too young to ride the go karts at the fair.

Then, out of jealousy and embarrassment, they got mad because you could and did ride. \n\nYou didn't make them big and they don't get extra rights because they are significantly overweight. They are selfish because this is clearly not discrimination.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You haven't fat shamed anyone. You just participated in an activity they couldn't do. If your bf wanted to skip the ride because his mom and sis couldn't go, that's his choice. Neither of you did the wrong thing. Except that he shouldn't expect you to miss out on something you want to do. \n\nIt is troubling that he feels you ruined \"family vacation\" when you already had the agreement that you all didn't have to do everything together. He violated that agreement and should apologize to you.", "NTA Too heavy is too heavy. Better to have a couple people feel insulted than to harm the horses.

None of them should've reacted this way.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly didn't do anything wrong, and your in-laws are delusional. I have several family members who would be disqualified on anything with a weight limit and I can't imagine any of them acting this way.

There is an upper limit to what a horse can safely carry, and that\u2019s around 250lbs, give or take. They would\u2019ve turned away an NFL linebacker or professional weightlifter as well.", "NTA but it might have been better to talk it through with your husband instead of just going, and remind him that you all agreed to do some activities separately and that it was something you really wanted to do. The manager was completely right to think of the welfare of the animals but you just look like you didn\u2019t care whether he went or stayed with his family, instead of the reality that it was something you really wanted to do ideally with your husband.", "NTA. You can do as you please.

If MIL had to get a seatbelt extender for her car - then it wasn't even close when it came to horse back riding.  OP and SO agreed ahead of time that they wouldn't be locked in to doing family events and would be free to do things on their own.\n\nSIL and MIL are AH's for putting up a stink about not being able to go horse back riding and OP's SO is a jerk for telling OP that she hates his family for going riding and thinking she should have skipped the ride out of \"solidarity\" with his mom and sister.", "NTA. I had something similar happen to me on vacation. I tend to be on the heavier side and we where doing a whole day trip that involved a horseback ride, and I knew going in there was 50/50 chance I was gonna have to hike along side the horse trail, because of how much my fluctuates on the daily. The staff made it very clear that if the stable deemed me to heavy I would walk. However I was lucky in that I was able to ride that day\u2026 I just had to ride on mule. Which honestly was totally fine because I ended up twisting my ankle on my first dismount (I landed on a slippery rock). And if it was from a horse I would broken my ankle in the Mexican jungle.

Not all horses can carry over a certain weight. Warning is if these women are over 200lbs. approaching 300!\n\nApparently, they didn't have draft horses (specifically certain breeds of them) to carry weights over a certain amount. Your boyfriend regardless of height & weight could ride which means they are bigger & heavier than him.\n\n***I don't care if they are insulted. I'm mad they would rather abuse a horse to keep their ego in check! That horse may never be able to be used again, in pain & in some extreme cases euthanized!***\n\nIf they & your boyfriend don't realize this, I doubt these are the people to be around. They weren't told they were fat. They only heard that. Most likely told they had no horses to accommodate their weight. ***Sorry, if their ego wants to hurt an animal they deserve to wait in the car or never go to a stable again. If they act entitled a horse of any size can carry them, they need to be as far away from a live animal as possible.***\n\nI'm near 300 lbs. I used to ride horses when young at a lighter weight. Now? I'd call to see if the stable had a horse (*ahead of time*) to accommodate me.

I'm not going to keep others came with me from riding them.\n\nThere were other activities everyone could do. This was a planned activity not all could do unfortunately. This wasn't discrimination or they the stables were rude to them.\n\nRather they demanded the support of OP for a slight thinking this was an offense (stating too fat to ride). When it was actually a fact. *She* chose to do something looking forward to & paid for herself. It's not her fault they're overweight. That's blunt but true. Again, what did they expect for them to do, allow them to ride a horse? That's cruelty to an animal.", "NTA. It isn't the saddle that makes them look fat......it's those fat asses.", "NTA. The agreement was that people could do separate activities.", "NTA    so if they couldn't swim, you should stay out of the water?", "NTA. We're responsible for others weight now? What do they expect from them for them to be allowed to ride the horse and cause injury?

I've gone a few times and it's so fun!", "NTA and I would have done the same thing.\n\nOn our 25th anniversary trip I really wanted to go horseback riding. The day of our anniversary I told him we're going riding. He really, really did not want to go. I said fine, drop me off at the stables and I'll go alone. He ultimately went with me and had a great time but I was willing to leave him \\*on our anniversary\\* to have a fun time doing something I really wanted to do. \n\nAnd as far as the weight thing goes for your MIL and SIL, it is a very rude and harsh awakening to not be able to do something because of your weight but it's a very sad reality - and hopefully is a wake up call for them if for no other reason than to get healthier.", "NTA. The in-laws couldn't handle the truth about themselves, and got mad when told they wouldn't be allowed to break rules that are meant for safety.

It\u2019s torture for them!", "NTA.  Who wants to **hurt a horse** by riding it if you are too heavy???????  And if you can\u2019t ride, that is no reason for others to not ride!  I\u2019ve been on the top heavy end plenty of times.  It\u2019s rotten to deny others their fun, you just do something else.\n\nSeriously, OP, the answer here is to be a broken record, whenever it comes up, \u201cwait, you want to risk hurting a horse by ignoring its weight limit?\u201d  Don\u2019t address solidarity, because it\u2019s nonsense based on the idea that it\u2019s ok to injure a horse.

Here in the UK we have very strict welfare standards for riding school horses and the weight limits they can legally carry is usually much less than the 20% research suggests as a maximum. This is because many riders are novices and are therefore lacking in balance and core strength when on a moving horse, and so feel like a dead weight and are much more harmful for the horse to carry. This is no fault of the new riders, as riding uses many muscles not found in many other sports so it takes quite a while to build them up. But it's also not the fault of the horse and their welfare was always our priority. Our largest horse at the riding school was about 17.2hh (approx 178cm to the top of his shoulder) and was part draft horse, weighing in at nearly 700kg. In therapy that means he could carry about 140kg, but our max weight limit for him (and the school in general) was 90kg (14 stone or whatever the equivalent is in lbs) because of all the other factors at play. This weight limit was based on vets advice and our council licencing agreement, as well as our own judgement of the horse in question.\n\nIt should also be noted that whilst initial research suggested that 20% was an acceptable amount for the horse to carry (and in than needs to include the weight of tack - English tack can weigh about 10kg which also needs to be factored in. Western saddles often weigh significantly more) more recent research suggests regularly carrying 20% is a risk factor in numerous issues with horses, with kissing spine (where the vertebrae are too close together and rub, causing severe pain) being very common. Research is now suggesting 10% to be a maximum for horses in hard work (hunting, eventing, racing etc) and 15% being a maximum for leisure horses. This advice is slowly trickling down in the UK and will hopefully become the norm soon.", "I\u2019ve travelled regularly and usually explore my surroundings on horseback and been in the equestrian community and it\u2019s sometimes incredibly difficult to tell apart good and bad horse trainers and handlers for someone who\u2019s not involved. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for relying on their confirmation, just know that those horse trekkings are a source of income and animal welfare and money don\u2019t go often hand in hand. \n\nThat\u2019s why I have written the text, to inform more people, so next time, they can make an educated decision in favour of the horse\u2019s well-being.", "14 pounds to a stone or 2.2 pounds to a kilogram", ">Apparently the standards differ between the US and the UK but I(maybe mistakenly) was thinking that OP was in US(living/flying across country)", "I'm scared of horses (at least getting on one anyway), so why did this make me sad that I'm just above the cut off \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI'm gonna go binge eat some carrots now so I can still sad eat but not make it worse.", "I\u2019m from neither country, and I highly doubt that the US or the UK have extraordinary strong horses that carry significantly heavy riders without impact\u2026 so my explanation stands worldwide. \n\nHowever, I did google the number again too and in my country it\u2019s 15 % max, including gear and all the points above.", "NTA not your fault they\u2019re overweight, delusional and have zero care for the horses welfare.", "NTA at all not even close, they are for sure", "NTA.
