You have to be a group of at least 4 persons, or you can join a group of random people. At the stable we were informed that my SIL and MIL would not be allowed to ride horses due to their weight. While they are aware they're both above an ideal weight, they do entertain a certain level of delusion towards their actual size. They threw a huge fit which, IMHO, was handled very well by the manager. \n\nMeanwhile I was booking my ride along with my SO ride. Hearing his mother and sister yelling he went to investigate. He come back to tell me we're going back to the hotel as his mother and sister were furious of being called \"fat\". I had just paid for our ride and was about to go pick my horse. The employee told me she could refund us both, or just his ride. I really wanted to go a horseback ride so I told my SO I was going. Two groups were getting ready so a stablehand inquired on my behalf if any group wanted to take a lone rider. I ended up with two unrelated couples. The ride was awesome, our guide was very funny and entertaining, the two couples were lovely and we had a really nice time together that made the whole time pass in the blink of an eye. \n\nI came back to the resort to my SO sulking in our room. His mother and sister teared him a new hole because I went on the ride instead of \"standing in solidarity with them\" and he was taking it out on me. We had a huge argument about how we agreed to not do everything together, he claimed I hated his family and ruined our \"family vacation\". The next morning he apologized for his reaction but still maintain that it was really shitty of me to go on the ride on my own seeing how they insulted his mother and sister. But from what I overheard from my side of the barn the manager handled it very diplomatically and in a very non-judgemental way, he explain it was out of concerns to the welfare of the animals and suggested other activities held at the stables they could do, even gave them free voucher for them.

When this comment section collects some steam and all the NTA judgements come in, I suggest showing them all to your dumbass husband in hopes he pulls his head out of his mother's ass.\n\nHe owes you more than apology.

You are allowed to do and enjoy things that YOU can do.\n\nThe \"solidarity\" thing is BS. There were probably listed rules and policies and the management was the one to deal with it. They didn't \"insult\" his family if it was unsafe for them to ride.", "NTA. I worked at an amusement park and I daily had to inform larger guests that they couldn\u2019t ride. Either weight limit or the safety restraints wouldn\u2019t fit correctly. It\u2019s common sense. Horses can only support  so much weight on their backs. Plus if they\u2019re that heavy how the hell would they get on or off their horses. \n\n\nOne of my siblings and their spouses are very obese. It\u2019s something my sister struggles with and she\u2019s lost weight and gained it back. She at least tries. My BIL is huge, he makes no effort to change. It\u2019s gotten to the point where he damages furniture. When it comes to family vacations, I don\u2019t let his limitations stop me from what I want to do. And it\u2019s gotten to the point where I have no sympathy for problems caused by his weight anymore. It\u2019s self inflicted.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve portrayed this accurately, the women weren\u2019t \u201cinsulted\u201d\u2026 The manager simply stated facts to take care of the animals. This family sounds ridiculous, and your boyfriend needs to wake up and see the reality of the situation.\n\nI\u2019m glad you had a fun time on the ride!", "NTA are they also against animal abuse? Do they know that making a horse carrying excessive weight will severely hurt them? Or are they just concerned about their hurt feelings?", "NTA, putting a large person on a horse can injure it.  They weren't being called fat, they're just too heavy for the horses.  Just because they couldn't go doesn't mean you should have chucked your ride.  Your SO should have joined as well.  Just because you were on vacation together doesn't mean you were chained at the hip.", "NTA at all. You stood in solidarity with the poor horses. They couldn't choose which butt was going to sit on him. It's same as a child throwing a tantrum because he's  too short or too young to ride the go karts at the fair. MIL and SIL probably wouldn't be allowed either. \n\nI'm glad you had a great time. Let them have their hissy fit.", "NTA \n\nMany things in life have a weight or size limit. When it comes to riding horses, that a living breathing animal that they were willing to injure in order to get their way. Then, out of jealousy and embarrassment, they got mad because you could and did ride. \n\nYou didn't make them big and they don't get extra rights because they are significantly overweight. They are selfish because this is clearly not discrimination.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You haven't fat shamed anyone. You just participated in an activity they couldn't do. If your bf wanted to skip the ride because his mom and sis couldn't go, that's his choice. Neither of you did the wrong thing. Except that he shouldn't expect you to miss out on something you want to do. \n\nIt is troubling that he feels you ruined \"family vacation\" when you already had the agreement that you all didn't have to do everything together. He violated that agreement and should apologize to you.", "NTA Too heavy is too heavy. Better to have a couple people feel insulted than to harm the horses. I'm overweight and probably too heavy to ride a horse, but I wouldn't want my loved ones to miss out because of me. Your inlaws aren't just delusional about their size, they're selfish.", "NTA Being told that you can't go on a horse ride because your overweight is not an insult, its a fact. None of them should've reacted this way.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly didn't do anything wrong, and your in-laws are delusional. I have several family members who would be disqualified on anything with a weight limit and I can't imagine any of them acting this way. You're going on the back of a living creature, obviously your weight is important. It's extremely selfish of them to then demand that the rest of the family not do the activity either because they're insulted by animal welfare.", "NTA. Do not go to any amusement park with them. They would be very insulted if they did not fit on every ride.", "NTA. I'm a fat woman. I KNOW I'm a fat woman. That comes with some limitations and I just need to suck it up and deal with it because it's MY problem not anybody else's. I'm glad you had a good time and I'm sorry that your MIL and SIL can't grasp reality and think everybody should suffer because they can't do it. Screw that.", "NTA.\nI can grasp why those entitled people are upset with you, but that's THEIR problem. I'm sorry to hear they are taking their bad attitude out on you.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.

It doesn't feel like a vacation if you have to forgo the things you want to do because someone else gets butthurt. I eventually stopped going on vacation with my extended family for that reason.\n\nAll they wanna do is do outdoor activities and I am 1000% an indoor person and the things I like to do are usually educational like going to museums (I'm an eternal scholar at heart lol). So it would be super frustrating when someone made me feel bad for wanting to go off on my own even though I AM IN MY FREAKING THIRTIES. I have some anger about this lol.", "NTA.

I  overweight myself and have been told that there are things I can\u2019t do, or had to get an extender, etc\u2026 I guess the difference is that I am self aware enough to accept the truth about myself and to understand that employees are just doing their jobs. I also have not begrudged other people to do things I couldn\u2019t.", "NTA, and I'd 100% be letting them know you'll decide when to support family in solidarity. \n\nI've stood up my MIL when she was targeted unfairly because she was brown,  but never when she was called out for some of her blatant manipulations (Seriously, she would fib about  anything if she thought it would get her what she wanted.)

This can\u2019t be news to them?", "NTA.\n\nYou wanted to go, they couldn\u2019t go, they were able to enjoy other activities. There was no reason for you to not do stuff, especially since this was a free-for-all kind of trip.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being big, or fat. There is an upper limit to what a horse can safely carry, and that\u2019s around 250lbs, give or take. They would\u2019ve turned away an NFL linebacker or professional weightlifter as well.", "NTA but it might have been better to talk it through with your husband instead of just going, and remind him that you all agreed to do some activities separately and that it was something you really wanted to do. The manager was completely right to think of the welfare of the animals but you just look like you didn\u2019t care whether he went or stayed with his family, instead of the reality that it was something you really wanted to do ideally with your husband.", "NTA. You can do as you please. I would have understood if they were treated poorly, but it sounds like they just didn\u2019t receive the rules well.", "NTA\nNow you have a reason for not hanging around them.  It is an amazing \ud83e\udd29 thing !\nEnjoy you newly acquired freedom.", "NTA.  It's not like SIL and MIl didn't know they were way overweight.  If MIL had to get a seatbelt extender for her car - then it wasn't even close when it came to horse back riding.  OP and SO agreed ahead of time that they wouldn't be locked in to doing family events and would be free to do things on their own.\n\nSIL and MIL are AH's for putting up a stink about not being able to go horse back riding and OP's SO is a jerk for telling OP that she hates his family for going riding and thinking she should have skipped the ride out of \"solidarity\" with his mom and sister.", "NTA. I had something similar happen to me on vacation. I tend to be on the heavier side and we where doing a whole day trip that involved a horseback ride, and I knew going in there was 50/50 chance I was gonna have to hike along side the horse trail, because of how much my fluctuates on the daily. The staff made it very clear that if the stable deemed me to heavy I would walk. However I was lucky in that I was able to ride that day\u2026 I just had to ride on mule. Which honestly was totally fine because I ended up twisting my ankle on my first dismount (I landed on a slippery rock). And if it was from a horse I would broken my ankle in the Mexican jungle. So I mean there are just things you have to accept when you are large.", "**NTA MIL & potential SIL are**\n\nSome horse stables have a wide variety of horses while others are limited\n\nOne can crack a horse's back & other injuries refusing to admit of a certain weight. Not all horses can carry over a certain weight. Warning is if these women are over 200lbs. approaching 300!\n\nApparently, they didn't have draft horses (specifically certain breeds of them) to carry weights over a certain amount. Your boyfriend regardless of height & weight could ride which means they are bigger & heavier than him.\n\n***I don't care if they are insulted. I'm mad they would rather abuse a horse to keep their ego in check! That horse may never be able to be used again, in pain & in some extreme cases euthanized!***\n\nIf they & your boyfriend don't realize this, I doubt these are the people to be around. They weren't told they were fat. They only heard that. Most likely told they had no horses to accommodate their weight. ***Sorry, if their ego wants to hurt an animal they deserve to wait in the car or never go to a stable again. If they act entitled a horse of any size can carry them, they need to be as far away from a live animal as possible.***\n\nI'm near 300 lbs. I used to ride horses when young at a lighter weight. Now? I'd call to see if the stable had a horse (*ahead of time*) to accommodate me. I was thrilled on one occasion I got to ride a Clydesdale (one of my favorite horse breeds).\n\nI used to go on rollercoasters. I can't now primarily due to vision issues. I'm not going to keep others came with me from riding them.\n\nThere were other activities everyone could do. This was a planned activity not all could do unfortunately. This wasn't discrimination or they were rude to them. \n\nRather they demanded the support of OP for a slight thinking this was an offense (stating too fat to ride). When it was actually a fact. She chose to do something looking forward to & paid for herself. It's not her fault they're overweight. That's blunt but true. Again, what did they expect for them to do, allow them to ride a horse? That's cruelty to an animal.", "NTA. It isn't the saddle that makes them look fat......it's those fat asses.", "NTA. The agreement was that people could do separate activities.", "NTA    so if they couldn't swim, you should stay out of the water?", "NTA. We're responsible for others weight now? What do they expect from them for them to be allowed to ride the horse and cause injury? It's ridiculous you'd be mad at others because of your own life decisions (yes ik medical conditions exist but that's a very small amount of overweight people). Girl you had every right to horseback riding. I've gone a few times and it's so fun!", "NTA and I would have done the same thing.\n\nOn our 25th anniversary trip I really wanted to go horseback riding. The day of our anniversary I told him we're going riding. He really, really did not want to go. I said fine, drop me off at the stables and I'll go alone. He ultimately went with me and had a great time but I was willing to leave him \\*on our anniversary\\* to have a fun time doing something I really wanted to do. \n\nAnd as far as the weight thing goes for your MIL and SIL, it is a very rude and harsh awakening to not be able to do something because of your weight but it's a very sad reality - and hopefully is a wake up call for them if for no other reason than to get healthier.", "NTA. The in-laws couldn't handle the truth about themselves, and got mad when told they wouldn't be allowed to break rules that are meant for safety. Plus they apparently caused a scene (\"Hearing his mother and sister yelling he went to investigate.\") They acted like entitled jerks, then expected you to storm out indignantly with them. \n\nGood for you for sticking to your plan! I hope your SO comes around, but I'm not super hopeful.", "NTA \n\nThank god these were responsible to those horses! I hate seeing horses and other animals carry huge people. It\u2019s torture for them!", "NTA.  Who wants to **hurt a horse** by riding it if you are too heavy???????  And if you can\u2019t ride, that is no reason for others to not ride!  I\u2019ve been on the top heavy end plenty of times.  It\u2019s rotten to deny others their fun, you just do something else.\n\nSeriously, OP, the answer here is to be a broken record, whenever it comes up, \u201cwait, you want to risk hurting a horse by ignoring its weight limit?\u201d  Don\u2019t address solidarity, because it\u2019s nonsense based on the idea that it\u2019s ok to injure a horse.

Couple's counseling, and find the exit if he refuses.  That's my advice.", "LOL obviously they have no idea how much it costs to feed a horse of that size.  It would simply not be cost effective. Just got a visual of a loading dock, bad me I know, but it made me chuckle.", "Also, sitting a horse that broad is not easy. They could go on a 'hayride' if it's that big a deal.", "Yeah, needing a seat belt extender is pretty heavy.", "Ah yes, the words that XYZ is the plan but in reality they wanted to control it all.  Definitely try to avoid traveling with them in the future. I had the same issue with my ex and his family. He still calls and asks me why he just automatically asks how high with his sisters say \"jump\".  It's ridiculous, and I don't miss it affecting my life at all.", "Eh, there's a decent chance it's fake; this is a common trope.", "Yeah, I'm fat (under 200lbs but definitely fat) and pregnant with big boobs. I am no where close to needing an extender. I imagine you need to be pretty big to need one.", "I am over the weight most horses (or the donkeys at the Grand Canyon) could handle, but nowhere near big enough for a seatbelt extender! If there's a weight limit on something, it's to protect you, whatever you'd be riding/using, or both. A friend of mine owns a horse. I'd love to ride it sometime, but if she says I'm too heavy, I know she's not fat-shaming me, she's protecting her animal!", "Hey Joe! We're gonna need a larger chute for these two...", "Limit on a chute is 16.5 Stone.", "For a vacation place they probably try to have a couple of horses that can carry up to 250lb or a bit more.  But it sounds like it was a pretty busy day to ride so those horses might be out or have hit their max trips as well.", "TIL... thank you for this!", "The 20% rule is common, but also you have to factor in the rider\u2019s ability- if the rider is new to horse riding they don\u2019t have as much control over their weight/balance (think slamming on the horse\u2019s back getting on or trotting) and so many places would actually want to round down from the 20% weight limit.", "I used to weigh 290 pounds, and I didn't need a seat belt extender. However, at that weight I certainly did not attempt to go horseback riding. One has to be realistic.", "I call dibs on NOT doing that tandem", "You mean \u2018we\u2019re gonna need two larger shoots for this one\u2019", "When the military drops tanks from airplanes they have a cluster of 3 giant parachutes", "Do we still have those hot air balloons?", "I was inexplicably sad to hear I\u2019m too big to go skydiving. I\u2019m heavier than I want to be, but still\u2026\n\nThen I double checked the conversion on google. Turns out my calculation was way off. I might be too stupid to skydive, jury\u2019s still out. But I\u2019m not too big!", "Nope you only shoot them when they're fat enough to eat. *\"Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered.\"* Until then you can use a (larger) chute...", "Well, thank you. You never go to bed without learning something new."]}
