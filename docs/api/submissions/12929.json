We used to catch up once every few months over a meal but after she became a very strict vegan, I stopped wanting to hang out, because:\n\n1. She only wants to eat at expensive vegan restaurants located far away from where we live. No compromise. I told her I don\u2019t mind going to somewhere where they sell both vegan and non-vegan food (because I dislike vegan food) but she said it won\u2019t do. I told her I don\u2019t mind trying her vegan food but one that\u2019s not as expensive or far away -won\u2019t do. Basically she feels that we must both eat expensive vegan food together. \n\n2. I just simply dislike vegan food. TO CLARIFY: most vegan restaurants in my country don\u2019t do nice dishes (I would know, I was vegan for a few years myself). The vegan food is incredibly expensive and often involves mock meat, which I dislike. Just happens that M loves mock meat and insists we eat it together too. I know I can do without meat for ONE meal and I did give in for many years - going to far away vegan restaurants, whichever she wanted to try. but all thing\u2019s considered now (her wish to eat only expensive food and from restaurants located really far away), I simply don\u2019t want to meet up because I feel like I\u2019m always the one giving in.  \n\nI may be TA because in lieu of those reasons above, I\u2019ve turned down all her attempts to meet over the last 6 years or so. She\u2019s upset that I \u201cprioritize meat\u201d over our friendship, and thinks I\u2019m super inflexible, but it really isn\u2019t the case, at least to me.\n\n\nTo clarify: she doesn\u2019t want to meet for anything other than eating or exercise. I tried proposing meeting for coffee but she says she\u2019s too busy, she wants to meet for a \u201cproductive\u201d activity (eating)", "created_utc": 1679504634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ypbh3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_accommodate_my_vegan/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The veganism is part of it, but clearly it's not at the core, OPs friend is just self serving and only wants to meet up if it suits their needs in general, as exercising is also mentioned. So don't bother arguing with him or the rest of the anti-vegan mob, there's no point.\n\nI genuinely think the whole anti veganism shit is just projection personally. And I'm not even vegan myself, I have no personal stake in the argument.
