I tried to have a conversation about it, but she doubled down on a decision she was making that was deeply harming a marginalized group in the US that I am a member of.  I wasn't getting anywhere on enlightening her so I ended things.  When she showed her true colors, I came to the conclusion she was no longer worthy of my time.  I'd bent over backwards to help her with housing, making friends when she was new to the area, taken her out on several boat rides to beautiful local places most people never get the opprtunity to see, and given her introductions to my friends in local groups of people that shared her interests.

Either she can deign to eat at a more affordable and potentially omnivorous restaurant (like Chipotle!) for the sake of seeing you, or she can get takeout from her favorite restaurant and bring it to your house, or she can pay for your dinner at one of these restaurants, or she can learn to see coffee as being productive, but right now, your boundaries are incompatible.", "NTA my best mate is a vegan and he NEVER puts his ideals on to me or our other friend.
