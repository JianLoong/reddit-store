I then had our first daughter. I have been supporting us financially while he is in school and we split watching our daughter and chores. Here\u2019s where the issue lies. My husband seems to be addicted to his phone games. Any free moment he is playing. He has forgotten to turn of burners, gets distracted from HW, and has issues prioritizing helping around the house. \n\nA few months ago our clergy leader recommended that he cut back on his video games to focus on our family and school. He did delete a few games then, but I haven\u2019t seen much change. My parents have been complaining to me that my husband will ignore chores around the house while standing in the middle of the room playing a game. I\u2019ve talked to him a few times and he said he\u2019s thinking about it and waiting for a solid answer from God for what he should do. \n\nThen his favorite phone game announced they would be ending. I thought for sure this was the sign for him, but he disagreed. \n\nTonight, I was hosting for my book club. I had been planning this get together for a month and my husband was meant to watch our daughter during it. I held my daughter for the first bit, because he was eating dinner and I know how hard it is to eat with our daughter, but then after 2 and a half hours I never saw him again. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene in front of my friends, so I just winged the evening with my daughter. \n\nUnfortunately, she got fussy so I excused myself several times to take care of her. I was really disappointed that I wasn\u2019t able to participate as much as I had planned.\n\n After a bit, my mom said it was odd that my husband hadn\u2019t come to collect our daughter and I agreed. My dad said that my husband has been outside with our dog since dinner was cleaned up. He had helped clean up to his credit. My dad took my daughter and said he\u2019d pass her along to my husband.\n\n I messaged my husband that I was very disappointed with how the evening turned out and that we\u2019d talk about it later. After my friends left, he came and apologized that he was slow to collect our daughter. He explained that he took our dog out to enjoy a bone  from dinner and lost track of time. He wouldn\u2019t admit to me that he was scrolling or playing phone games.\n\n I believe he truly felt sorry. He asked what he could do to make it up to me and I asked him to delete all his phone games. He seemed surprised, but he did. He is very bummed now and I feel terrible. I truly believe he will be so much more successful with out the distraction, but did I go to far?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the very very important detail that my husband has depression and severe AdHd. Please take that into consideration. My husband is not under fire here. I personally do not consider him an AH. Judge me alone, please.

I know adhd and depression shows up in different ways for us, and I sympathize for the both of you. That doesn\u2019t mean though that he shouldn\u2019t seek help if he\u2019s struggling and do what he can to find tools that make his and your life together easier. He has a responsibility to you and your child, as well as to being a good house mate to your parents. You can be understanding while holding him accountable. The struggle of having depression and adhd is real, but that being said, he chose you and having a baby with you.

He\u2019s letting you pick up all the slack while he\u2019s treated like an overgrown child and you get more frazzled. \n\nThis sign from God is never going to come.

It's not about games it's about the fact ADHD brains don't make the same chemical rewards for completing mundane tasks as neurotypical brains. It's even hard for us to get started on tasks we WANT to do sometimes because of executive dysfunction, it's not laziness it's a faulty starter motor.  He needs professional medical help to manage this. Maybe medication even.   NAH but this is something that is going to take patience and work to get through and you probably want to let him  have a few games once you find some balance or it may make his depression worse if you don't.

Kudos to you for being so astute and compassionate. \n\nIt might also be helpful to sit down with him and talk about how he's feeling about the choices the two of you have made recently. If he's feeling a bit lost for direction outside of his studies, you might consider telling him you'd be super impressed if he got a job and took on some of the financial responsibilities the two of you share. Tell him you're getting hyper to move back out of your parent's home even though they're all for it and totally supportive, because you'd rather devote your time and energy to him and the baby, even if it means you're scraping by.\n\nFeeling like one's life is without real purpose, and that no one really needs you, can put a person into a tailspin that is so distracting one can't do even the most basic things. Playing a video game gives immediate purpose to the moment and helps with focusing on something outside yourself that you are potentially very good at.

I always spend time with her when she gets home and do my best to stay off my phone unless we are watching memes together. Although when she falls asleep and if im not tired I'll start up my game and begin playing. And reliving my childhood of all the games i bugged my dad to buy me. It's a good thing you made him delete his games because a baby needs both parents. and if anything were to happen im sure he would regret the times he spent playing games instead of being with his wife and child.

It used to be exercise for him, but he has been having a hard time returning to that habit. Maybe I should encourage that more? Or would that just be replacing the games?  I guess he wouldn\u2019t be able to get distracted that way.", ">He has very severe ADHD\n\nOk, these behaviors are all likely bc of his ADHD. If it's this out of control, I think he needs to seek treatment to help him learn how to cope with his day to day life. \n\nWhile ADD/ADHD hits men and women differently, I know that it can intensify as get older. My own ADD has been ramping up over the last 5-10 years when I was able to easily handle it in my teens and 20s. \n\nIf he's not medicated, he may need to start on meds. If he is medicated, it's obviously not working so a new medication regimen may be needed. \n\nPersonally, I don't think he's trying to get out of being a father. When he says he got lost in the game, he means that literally. \n\nThere have been times where I've e picked up a book and the next think I knew 10hrs had gone by and I was only stopping because I *really* needed to pee. \n\nThe best way to keep a marriage healthy and whole is communication. TALK TO HIM!!! Ask him for way that have helped him in the past in dealing with the ADHD. Find out if he's open to your parents helping him manage it as well, and if so, sit down with your parents and husband, and explain to them what's going on.

Avoid the world, avoid responsibilities, avoid feeling bad, but also avoid connection and joy and purpose and real satisfaction at a job well-done.  He needs to manage his depression instead.  This seems like a common theme, from your other post - he sounds very avoidant.  He avoids facing his problems and tries to run from them instead.  The problem is that his problems are part of him, and no matter how far you run, there you are.  The one thing you can never escape is yourself.  Escapism is a bad coping technique.  He needs to learn to do real self-care and connect to his life instead of withdrawing and avoiding it.  It is past time that he starts work on healing himself instead of trying to avoid the pain.  He has a wife and a child, and his avoidance is breaking every important relationship in his life and harming everyone he loves.  It\u2019s making him forget that love is as much about action as it is about feeling.  How loving is it to leave all the work on your shoulders?  How loving is it to be physically present but completely unavailable and shut off?\n\nAt the end of the day, he needs to start choosing the life he wants instead of avoiding the life he has.  That will at a minimum mean therapy.  It might mean medication, but he won\u2019t know unless he tries therapy and it isn\u2019t enough.  And no, your preacher\u2019s counseling isn\u2019t enough, he needs a therapist who has training and experience in treating ADHD and depression.  He needs to become an active participant in his life, in his relationships, in his work, and that takes learning positive coping techniques and saying no to avoidance and escapism.\n\nEscapism and avoidance are choosing to kill a part of yourself - the part that connects and builds and has purpose and meaning.  And as much as you and your child deserve that part of him being alive and thriving, *he* deserves that even more.  He deserves relationships and having a passion for things and truly living his life and building a life he\u2019s proud of.  He deserves to be someone who respects himself and can look at his life and say \u201cI built that, we made that together, I am a part of something that is wholesome and good and worthwhile.  I am worthy of the good things in my life.\u201d  Right now, all he\u2019s doing is killing time and avoiding life.

I think talking about you didn\u2019t want to ask it, but had to will ease it. It\u2019s sad to see someone suffering and not wanting to get help. On the other side, escaping is a way to maintain the depression. If you explain it from a position of love and not knowing how to help him another way than this, I think you did something valid.

I know that usually helps me. \n\nIf he needs a bit more structure with what needs to be done, offer to help him make a schedule (it can be as loose or as detailed as needed) so that he has allotted times for certain activities, and that can also help with depression, even if it's just that he needs to disconnect/ground himself after classes are done for the day. I know that helped me a lot when I was studying.\n\nHe'll probably slip back into old habits, but it's important to guide and be understanding when that happens and to just start again.

I have previously talked with him about managing it. He refuses, because of some previous trauma related to his parents.

Perfect amount of tough love and honesty in your words.", "Boy, does this hit home\u2026\n\nSo no.  I say NTA.\n\nGood on you to recognize that this isn\u2019t simply a matter of him being \u201clazy\u201d or inattentive.  You know he has ADHD and depression.  That alone helps him, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like that.\n\nSpeaking from experience, therapy is difficult.  Two things must happen (after agreeing to go).  First, you have to find a good one and that can take time.  Ask your clergyman for help in this matter.  He may know of someone or can point you in the right direction.  Second, it takes work.  Changing habits is one thing (and it\u2019s not easy).  But confronting pain in your past\u2026that\u2019s overwhelming.  In the end, it is worth it though!\n\nHonestly, the best thing to do is to have some open, honest conversations with him.  No ultimatums or judgement or nagging.  That will only make him dog in his heels.  Approach it like a conversation you\u2019d have over a glass of wine (if you don\u2019t drink, hopefully you can imagine the situation I\u2019m going for).  Be encouraging and convey how you feel.  Allow him to express himself and acknowledge his feelings too.\n\nThis won\u2019t happen overnight.  It will take time.  Don\u2019t rush it though.  As irritating as it is, it\u2019s not a crisis.", "Thank you for not immediately disregarding my husband as a person.

It's possible he doesn't agree about how his ADHD is affecting your life because if things aren't right in front of our noses, we don't notice them *at all.* I bet if he were to be left alone in the house for a week, the growing pile of dishes and trash would be a clue. That's definitely a last resort move, though.\n\nI want to pass on something I first saw on reddit that's really helped me with buckling down and working on the aspects of my ADHD that my meds don't magically fix: \"Your mental health is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\"", "Then it's definitely time for a serious conversation and possibly couples counseling. Unfortunately, a lot of ppl with ADD/ADHD have trauma from their parents, especially those around my age bc ADD was a new diagnosis back in the late 80s, early 90s. ADHD wasn't even a thing when I was diagnosed. The only medicine available was Ritalin and it turned us all into zombies. Back then parents just didn't have the tools to know how to raise a kid w severe ADHD and turned to more abusive type tactics to get their kid under control. Which has now resulted in traumatized adults that are terrified to get their ADD/ADHD treated. \n\nAll I can really say is try to be both understanding and firm. You are having to pick up all the balls he drops because he's forgotten they were in the air or because he had what I like to refer to as a shiny moment. Which is essentially when he's doing something or talking about something and then gets distracted out of nowhere by something \"shiny\". \n\nDon't try listing everything he's not doing if you're in the middle of a fight bc then he'll become defensive. Instead sit down w him when you're both in good moods and calm. Recognize everything he does do as well as pointing out all the dropped balls you're having to pick up. \n\nUnless you've got reasons to believe he's using his ADHD to get out of his responsibilities, which it doesn't sound like hes doing, try to remember he's not doing these things on purpose. \n\nOn the off chance he is doing this purposely, that an entire different can of worms, and one I'd toss in the trash.", ">He refuses, because of some previous trauma related to his parents.\n\nHe is a parent now, he has to get his shit together for the sake of your child. I can't think of the right words to phrase it, but it feels like he's letting his parents ruin his life and relationships now. I have ADD and shit parents, but at some point you have to decide whether your past is still going to shackle you or not, and unfortunately he doesn't have much of a choice in the matter now. He's putting your family in danger if he's getting too distracted to turn off burners", "I live with bipolar, and probably ADHD, and am married to someone with depression and ADHD.  I\u2019ve walked this path myself, and tried to help my own spouse navigate it.  My husband\u2019s avoidance has come perilously close to ending our relationship, and we\u2019re not out of the woods yet because he keeps choosing his avoidant depression habits over the ones that help him to be better, because they\u2019re easy and safe.\n\nGetting better isn\u2019t easy.  It\u2019s a bit like doing physical rehab after a severe injury - all the habits and ways of thinking that build you up get weak when you\u2019re not using them.  So it is honest to goodness hard work to build them up and make yourself do things right.  But it\u2019s also how you go from being mentally bed-bound to having an active, healthy life again.  If you keep avoiding the hard work, it\u2019s like choosing to never walk again because PT is hard and it makes you tired.", "Sorry my English isn\u2019t my main language \ud83d\ude02", "He does sound like he adores you. I think you've picked a really good guy. No worries, the kindness, understanding and strength you're showing him now will be just what you need and receive down the road. A struggle with a loving hand to hold is one worth celebrating.", "Maybe not hand him a schedule, but make one with him? And be certain to tell him it's to help *him*. Even though you and I know it's to help you both, especially in the long run. \n\nIf he has no execution issues, make a to-do list together instead.\n\nEven though he needs to step up and help around, he might need help in doing so, considering he has depression, it's important to remind him that it's not because he's *lacking*, he just needs a little help - and there's nothing wrong with that.", "I like that phrase. Well put.", "Thank you. No he is not doing any of this intentionally.", "A lot of people have suggested healthy alternatives. This past month we\u2019ve gotten into volleyball and badmitton. We both have a lot of fun playing. I enjoy walks and hiking and he does too with lots of allergy medicines. He\u2019ll go with me most of the time even though he suffers from outside allergies.", "Thank you!", "I bet I could find him in the right mood to make a schedule. We previously had a distribution of chores list, but he didn\u2019t like that and suggested we just do what needs to get done when we see it. You can imagine that didn\u2019t work well, but we have the college try. He agreed to go back to my distribution of chores list. I could try something similar with designated times. We have soemthing similar. I watch out daughter in the morning one while he does hw and he watches his in the afternoons and evenings when I work. We split one hour on one hour off of \u201cprimary caretaker time\u201d if our down time. He is a very active parent. But when we go off our schedule like tonight he just.. gets lost.", "I'm glad. The first time I read it, it was like it hit a switch in my brain from \"ugh, I can't do this\" to \"right, let's knuckle-down and get this self-improvement train moving.\" So now I pass it on wherever and whenever I can in the hopes that it does the same for someone else.\n\nSending you and your husband my best. ADHD is a right bitch to live with sometimes, but once it's managed - with meds, habits, or both - you can start to see the upsides, odd as that may sound.", "You're welcome. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more.", "Those are good, but he really needs to do therapy.  If he doesn\u2019t figure out why he\u2019s avoiding his life and do something about it, he\u2019s just going to find new ways to be avoidant.  That\u2019s the nature of the beast.", "Yes. I can understand how he's getting lost when going outside of routine. I usually do that, too. \n\nI hope you guys succeed and find a way to move forward together. It seems to me that he's a good person, who needs a little help getting back on track/schedule and taking charge of how he grounds himself. Do suggest he takes a walk or something when he can. He can also take your daughter with him in the pram while he's taking care of her/while she's napping. I bet getting out will help him a lot.", "Therapy will be a hard sell.", "If he can\u2019t deal with what causes him to be depressed and learn to change his patterns of thought, speech (especially self-talk, the things he says to himself), and action, he won\u2019t have a chance at not being depressed.  He won\u2019t get better, or at best he\u2019ll cycle between a little better and finding his next escape.  Therapy is necessary."]}
