Usually I'd say you should RSVP no so the host doesn't have to follow up in case the invited person just forgot or their response got lost somehow. Given you aren't in contact and haven't been for years I agree no relationship means no RSVP. You shouldn't be forced to contact someone you're in no contact with out of general manners. Manners are for how you treat people you're in contact with, even if they're a cashier or someone you have even the slightest contact with. They aren't for people you're no contact with, else you're in contact, which defeats the purpose of no contact.", "NTA. The happiness of your mother's full grown step-daughter is not anyone's responsibility - but definitely not yours. If your mother wanted to make amends she would put her energy into making the family time about you. Taking you out so you guys can talk and start repairing things (assuming you even wanted that).

Sigh. Look. I understand parents divorce and re-marry, creating blended families.....but sometimes those families are not going to blend. Remarried parents then try to force their \"one big happy family\" dream onto their children. The trouble is human affections and human relations don't work like that. Children, no matter what parents would like are independent human beings and cannot be forced to feel things they do not just for the parents sake. \n\nYour mother knew-or should know--that you would not be attending this party. After all you are NC with all of them.  Demanding an RSVP is just ridiculous. Ignore her.", "NTA obviously you were going to say no.

Her choice to send an invitation does not mean that you are obliged to interact with her.", "NTA. Big shock.

It isn't your problem to befriend such an obnoxious person.", "Your mom is delusional. There was never any relationship with your stepsister so there's no relationship to repair.

Two things can be true. You\u2019re right and your mom is right. You\u2019re right in that your feelings are valid and I\u2019m sure there is a rich history in your 18 years that a absolutely justifies the relationship you\u2019ve chosen and that\u2019s before the consequences of stepsisters actions.  Your mom is also right in this case- Someday you\u2019ll have to mature to the point of RSVPing no politely without it being emotionally charged. It\u2019s okay that it\u2019s not yet.

You do whatever you need to do to feel comfortable, safe and respected.", "ESH. You've had no contact for 4 years, how do you know this girl hasn't changed? Is there no such thing as redemption or growth? I hate to think a >14 year old has to be labeled for the rest of their life. I mean I obvi don't know the details, and she may still be a bullying asshole, but it's not healthy for you to continue to carry such hatred. The best revenge is a life lived well.
