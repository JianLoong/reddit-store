Usually I'd say you should RSVP no so the host doesn't have to follow up in case the invited person just forgot or their response got lost somehow. Given you aren't in contact and haven't been for years I agree no relationship means no RSVP. You shouldn't be forced to contact someone you're in no contact with out of general manners.

Sigh. Look. I understand parents divorce and re-marry, creating blended families.....but sometimes those families are not going to blend. Remarried parents then try to force their \"one big happy family\" dream onto their children. The trouble is human affections and human relations don't work like that. Children, no matter what parents would like are independent human beings and cannot be forced to feel things they do not just for the parents sake. \n\nYour mother knew-or should know--that you would not be attending this party.

Your mom is also right in this case- Someday you\u2019ll have to mature to the point of RSVPing no politely without it being emotionally charged. It\u2019s okay that it\u2019s not yet.

Mom told me as an 18 year old I should be more polite and learn how to RSVP. I told her that no relationship means no RSVP.*\n\nYou are right.  She's wrong.  In a normal situation, RSVP would be the right response.  But **this isn't a normal situation.** This is a situation where you had to cut her out of your life because of her bad behavior.  **This is a situation where you have to protect yourself from her.**  Abusers do not get to use the norms for normal people to demand a response.  Abusers are the ones that broke the relationship, not us.  You do not owe them anything, ever, because of their abuse.  You do not owe them a greeting if they show up at your favorite grocery store.  You do not owe them RSVPs or answering their texts or anything.  THEY lost all that, by what they did.  \n\n**This is not your fault.  Polite responses are for polite society, not abusers.**\n\n *She told me to grow up. I hung up on her.* \n\n**You are growing up.  Without her help.  You made adult decisions, like protecting yourself from her manipulations** and abuses.  And hanging up on her.  And refusing to let her manipulate you into treating her like she was someone that was part of polite society and deserved to get answered when she invades your no contact.   You did very well here, acting like an adult.\n\n*But I got some random comments on Instagram that I assume are her dummy accounts telling me I am being mean.*\n\nNope.  **You are protecting yourself from a manipulative abuser** who just tried yet another way to get your compliance to her wants.  **When she accuses you of being mean, she's projecting.**  Her whole goal was to get a response from you, and maybe to force your compliance to her wants, which ignored all your needs.

In another comment OP is asked if she would have a relationship with her mother if her mother didn't try to force a sister relationship on her. OP says she would still speak to her mother but her mother made it clear that she would never accept her reasonable boundaries. If people try to manipulate or force you into things against your fair boundaries they deserve to be cut off.", "Right but that bully is a little girl she was 14 and you want your mom to suffer because she married a 14 year old girl with behavior issues dad. You call her \u201cthe bully\u201d as an attempt to dehumanize her but she ain\u2019t never done nothing to you yet you saw her behavior to other people and when presented with an opportunity to help her by showing her compassion you othered her blamed your mom and now are playing the victim on Reddit. No you\u2019re NTA for what you said to your mum but you\u2019re definitely an AH for how you\u2019re behaving at 18 to an even that happened years ago when you had an opportunity to help both the people getting bullied and the bully herself", "She bullied some of my closest friends. She didn't need to do anything to me for me to feel how I do about her. She targeted people I care about, people I love. I helped my friends who were bullied. I even supported kids who weren't my friend who were bullied. But I don't have compassion for someone who bullies others the way she bullied them."]}
