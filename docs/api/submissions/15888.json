Usually I'd say you should RSVP no so the host doesn't have to follow up in case the invited person just forgot or their response got lost somehow. Given you aren't in contact and haven't been for years I agree no relationship means no RSVP. You shouldn't be forced to contact someone you're in no contact with out of general manners.

Children, no matter what parents would like are independent human beings and cannot be forced to feel things they do not just for the parents sake. \n\nYour mother knew-or should know--that you would not be attending this party.

Your mom is also right in this case- Someday you\u2019ll have to mature to the point of RSVPing no politely without it being emotionally charged. It\u2019s okay that it\u2019s not yet.

But **this isn't a normal situation.** This is a situation where you had to cut her out of your life because of her bad behavior.  **This is a situation where you have to protect yourself from her.**  Abusers do not get to use the norms for normal people to demand a response.  Abusers are the ones that broke the relationship, not us.  You do not owe them anything, ever, because of their abuse.  You do not owe them a greeting if they show up at your favorite grocery store.  You do not owe them RSVPs or answering their texts or anything.  THEY lost all that, by what they did.  \n\n**This is not your fault.  Polite responses are for polite society, not abusers.**\n\n *She told me to grow up. I hung up on her.* \n\n**You are growing up.  Without her help.  You made adult decisions, like protecting yourself from her manipulations** and abuses.  And hanging up on her.  And refusing to let her manipulate you into treating her like she was someone that was part of polite society and deserved to get answered when she invades your no contact.   You did very well here, acting like an adult.\n\n*But I got some random comments on Instagram that I assume are her dummy accounts telling me I am being mean.*\n\nNope.  **You are protecting yourself from a manipulative abuser** who just tried yet another way to get your compliance to her wants.  **When she accuses you of being mean, she's projecting.**  Her whole goal was to get a response from you, and maybe to force your compliance to her wants, which ignored all your needs.

Both do not deserve friendship.\n\nSheesh.", "Then good job sticking to your boundaries. That\u2019s all there is to say. This shit is hard and you did nothing wrong.", "I\u2019m sure that he would answer if I called him\u2026he\u2019s participated in 3 or 4 way texts with my other siblings and has never indicated he was MC\u2026but you could be right. I doubt it since he didn\u2019t leave those text groups and responded to things all 3 others said\u2026but it\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t push boundaries at all\u2026he lives his life and I and my brother (sister has passed) live theirs. The difference is that I understand common courtesy because that\u2019s the way we were raised\u2026and the almost 50% demographic here that\u2019s less than 24 largely ignores common courtesy from my observation. Don\u2019t know your age\u2026but if you\u2019re in that 50% maybe that illustrates my point.", "They're probably the mom trying to garner sympathy.", "Obviously she is doing a crappy job at being NC since moms number wasn\u2019t blocked and she didn\u2019t immediately hang up\u2026but whatever. Your ridiculous claim that NC trumps NC (or really poorly executed NC)\u2026sort of indicates you might not understand common courtesy either\u2026but as I said many young people don\u2019t. Here we are disagreeing and debating\u2026but we are being polite. An invite usually includes a reply card for the RSVP\u2026it is easy to just check no and put it in the mail.", "I wouldn\u2019t say Nc as neither of us have ever said that\u2026and he\u2019s participated as I noted in group texts with us and responded to us\u2026it is mostly a matter of we have little to nothing in common and don\u2019t talk much. The other 3 siblings got educated and had rewarding and well paid careers\u2026he was content to ignore education (he\u2019s nod stupid, just lazy), quit numerous jobs, refuse to tru and better himself, and grow dope in the yard. Don\u2019t care about the dope one way or the other\u2026not my thing and I had a security clearance and drugs are a hard no there but if he wants to then it\u2019s his life. And today he\u2019s retired on disability because of his \u2018bad back\u2019\u2026but works for cash as a yard maintenance guy and participates in kick boxing and other martial arts so o really question his disability\u2026but despite all of that I can still be polite to him.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be around people who don\u2019t bring you peace.", "Why do you think op doesnt know how to rsvp? Op probably knows how rsvp work, and choose to no respond to their mom, isnt that hard to get.", "If you want to talk about common courtesy...common courtesy says you don't harass someone who has gone NC with you and who very clearly informed of the fact.", "I am actually over the age of 24 by quite a bit. But as the person below stated, people here 50% or more try not to harass people. You seem level headed, I don\u2019t know your situation. In the situation OP explained they made it clear to their mother over multiple years they were completely no contact. In this case, the mother continuing to force contact, and using a different phone number is harassment. If someone is harassing you, then you\u2019re no longer required to rsvp. In fact I would avoid responding so the person doesn\u2019t have any idea where I may be to avoid further potential harassment.", "What part of \"mom called her from a different number\" is so difficult for you to understand?   Is it the words, or the concept?\n\nAnd if you want to make the \"common courtesy\" argument, then the actual violator is mom, because common courtesy says you do not harass people with invitations when they have made it clear that contact is not welcome.\n\nI'm beginning to think the other poster who suggested that you are mom is right.", "Again the difference is you still are fine with contact from your brother... OP is not and states as much very clearly in the post.  Her mother knew before sending the RSVP that her own daughter wanted nothing to do with her because of the step daughter and despite OP being no contact (per OP's wishes ) for 3 years she sent the RSVP. Then when that didn't work she harassed op by using a different phone number to contact her . Common Courtesy does still exist but it does not mean that you have to speak with someone that you have made clear prior that you want nothing to do with.", "You don't have to declare that you're dropping contact to make it \"official\".", "Your mom should have known better to even send it. She was trying to force communications, and that is bad on her.", " NTA. You\u2019re better than me at answering unknown calls I\u2019m over 30 & all unknown calls go to voicemail. No answer is an answer just like no is a full sentence/answer.", "I guess it's because I like ice cream.  \n\n\nJust because mom is an AH doesn't mean ghosting an invitation is right. What don't you get about that?  \n\n\nIf she was no contact like you're wanting it to be, this post wouldn't exist, and she would have just hung up.  Which is what I would have done. I wouldn't have the question of being an AH about it at all.   \n\n\nBut you absolutely fail to understand is that op may not feel like this forever, and there's something inherent about those that share DNA with you that it's unhealthy to close off permanently before your frontal lobe is full developed. There isn't physical, psychological or sexual abuse listed here. There's a well founded dynamic that is unhealthy and space is needed.  I smell a narcissist mom, but there's not enough to make that accusation on a subreddit and it's none of our business- and yes, if that were the case, the non-contact will probably be permanent, but neither you nor I have any business commenting on it beyond the parameters of the sub.   \n\n\nWe both have agreed she's N T A, so thanks for the chat and continuing opportunity to get downvoted and best wishes.", "I mean, I\u2019m no contact with my stalker. If he sends me a birthday invite, do you think I hace go RSVP no?\n\nThe daughter being no contact with the mother is absolutely a justification for not RSVPing."]}
