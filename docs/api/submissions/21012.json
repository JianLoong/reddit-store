He likes to complain because his commission compensation was reduced and the pre sales engineers got a raise. I know it\u2019s because a lot of sales people were writing really aggressive contracts that led to unhappy customers and now the guidelines for sales has made it harder to make sales. My bf use to make $40k more so he\u2019s a bit pissed about that although to me it\u2019s just the natural downturn in the tech sector. \n\nHe was talking shit about how all presales engineers do is talk about products on PowerPoint and don\u2019t do any actual work that makes the customer sign. I got annoyed because he doesn\u2019t know anything about tech and most presales engineers I use to work at had 4-8 years of software development experience not to mention very specific training on the products before they got to be making that salary. I have 2 years of support experience 3 years of software dev experience before I made 180k and my bf only has sales experience so to discount with how much knowledge is needed is pretty shitty. He said he knows some coding and could take their jobs.\n\nI told him since he thinks he thinks he knows their role he should be able to pass a junior coding interview and technical questions. He agreed and said loser pays for dinner and I agreed.

I had 10 very basic questions and he couldn\u2019t answer a single one. He also did make any of the code run. \n\nHe was pissed and argued with me the entire time but I googled things to prove he wasn\u2019t right he would sulk and didn\u2019t pay to dinner.\n\nI was kind of bitter he didn\u2019t pay for dinner and when a friend of his came over a week later I told him about it and we had a good laugh because he always likes to complain how easy engineers have it while he has to travel and boasts how he could do their jobs easily.

Tearing each other down in front of friends is a good way to lose trust and respect for each other, and without that it's hard to keep the relationship going.\n\nYou proved your point.

I'm in the same same industry, started as sales then moved to post sales engineering, we should have a similar job scope. I have been on both sides. The number of times sales talk shit about us but afraid to meet client tech team by themselves is hilarious. I have also sat in meetings and listen to the sales team promise the sky, none of which was deliverable, even in the case that it were it is way beyond the client's budget and they need to partner with 3rd party providers which sales will conveniently neglect to mention.
