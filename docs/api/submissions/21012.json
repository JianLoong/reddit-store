I since left but he\u2019s still there. He makes about $130k in tech sales. I make $180k as a cloud architect. He likes to complain because his commission compensation was reduced and the pre sales engineers got a raise. I know it\u2019s because a lot of sales people were writing really aggressive contracts that led to unhappy customers and now the guidelines for sales has made it harder to make sales. My bf use to make $40k more so he\u2019s a bit pissed about that although to me it\u2019s just the natural downturn in the tech sector. \n\nHe was talking shit about how all presales engineers do is talk about products on PowerPoint and don\u2019t do any actual work that makes the customer sign. I got annoyed because he doesn\u2019t know anything about tech and most presales engineers I use to work at had 4-8 years of software development experience not to mention very specific training on the products before they got to be making that salary. I have 2 years of support experience 3 years of software dev experience before I made 180k and my bf only has sales experience so to discount with how much knowledge is needed is pretty shitty. He said he knows some coding and could take their jobs.\n\nI told him since he thinks he thinks he knows their role he should be able to pass a junior coding interview and technical questions. He agreed and said loser pays for dinner and I agreed. I got some interview questions and coding questions like fizz buzz and hash map coding questions. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t answer a single question not even things like what\u2019s a difference between Java and Python, explain what the OSI layers are, what caching is and the craziest one is what\u2019s the difference between SAAS and IAAS which he definitely should know because he is selling SAAS products. I had 10 very basic questions and he couldn\u2019t answer a single one. He also did make any of the code run. \n\nHe was pissed and argued with me the entire time but I googled things to prove he wasn\u2019t right he would sulk and didn\u2019t pay to dinner.\n\nI was kind of bitter he didn\u2019t pay for dinner and when a friend of his came over a week later I told him about it and we had a good laugh because he always likes to complain how easy engineers have it while he has to travel and boasts how he could do their jobs easily. He was there and yelled at me later for humiliating him.", "created_utc": 1688168041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nfogo/aita_for_humiliating_my_bf_and_telling_his_friends/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You for bringing it up with a friend of his just so you could both laugh at him about it.", "NTA you and his friend were just having a good laugh over something light hearted. it sounds like your bf is a little embarrassed about not knowing something simple for his field of work.", "ESH\n\nYou didn't have to tell the friend, but you did, specifically to humiliate him.\n\nHe talked a good game, but could back it up and is a sore loser. He lost a betand didn't pay up.", "ESH. He was talking smack, you proved your point. Rubbing salt in the wound by telling a friend is just making fun of him and just made him feel worse. This is a small disagreement and you could have defended your feelings in a much less inflammatory way.", "NTA. He got the right treatment for acting so winey", "He welched on a bet.  Humiliate him some more until he pays up.  NTA", "ESH.\n\nTelling his friend about it was cold and unnecessary. You already made your point.", "Yta look I have been an engineer for awhile.

Kinda a intermediary between sales and development. Technical expertise is priceless. Knowing I had a team of wizards to call was always more valuable than having a sales guy that promised such crazy shit I needed wizards. Having said that, a big ego is important for sales. Don\u2019t crush his ego if you want him to be successful. He doesn\u2019t need to be an astronaut to be sales, just a confident monkey.", "As much as I can\u2019t stand braggarts OR sore losers,you crossed the line when you told his friend.

Was the friend one of your former/his present coworkers? If so, YTA. Otherwise, your bf is being a sore loser and has some ribbing coming to him.
