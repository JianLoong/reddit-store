You gf sure is though.", "NTA, but your girlfriend seems to be. \n\nEvery last moment with your mother should be cherished, but her last Mother\u2019s Day should be a special day to celebrate her and make memories with her whilst you still can.

This is your girlfriend not your wife. She can visit her mother on mother's day and have a fun time without you.

You have one mothers day left with your mom and your gf will have multiple with hers. Your needs absolutely trump hers in this instance. She needs to stop being so selfish", "NTA.

Go and spend the day with your mother on what is likely to be her last Mother\u2019s Day. You\u2019ll treasure every moment you had with her once she\u2019s gone. Personally, I\u2019d feel extremely resentful if someone tried guilt tripping me into going and sitting in a movie instead of being with my terminally ill mother just because they feel incapable of visiting their family alone. \n\nYour gf needs to take a step back and think about how selfish a request this is of her to make. If she\u2019s not capable of seeing just how absurd and selfish she is being then I would seriously question the relationship altogether. Do you really want to be with someone that callous and self centered?", "NTA. Your mother is terminally ill. Her mother is not. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dividing and conquering so each person sees their OWN mother. Your gf appears co-dependent unable to do anything without having you along.

Your gf is a huge one though", "NTA is your gf stupid though? Why does she think it\u2019s ok. To leave your terminally ill mother on Mother\u2019s Day?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re facing this alone and your partner isn\u2019t supportive.", "NTA \n\nHopefully your gf will come to terms with this, and maybe even talk it thru with her own mom and later apologize to you.\n\nBut your NTA in this situation at all.", "NTA. Yor GF seems entitled AF", "NTA. What the actual hell is wrong with your gf? I am disgusted by her behavior.", "NTA. Your GF is probably being guilted by her sister, mom or both. If they (and GF) can't wrap their brains around you needing to spend what is her last mother's day with your mom then they are very shallow, self-centered people. I'm sorry about your impending loss and hope the day you spend with your mom is a good one.", "Nta but your gf is very inconsiderate", "NTA\n\nEven if she was your wife, you've every right to spend what could possibly be your last mother's day with your mom. She should understand that and how awful she is for giving you a hard time with this.\n\nI'd seriously reconsider that relationship, she has an awful side that she's just starting to show.", "NTA! Your girlfriend is selfish and so incredibly disrespectful. \n\nYou go and spend Mother\u2019s Day with your mom and she can go suck a lemon. What an absolute B*\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your mom. Make the most of the time you have. Make some awesome memories on Mother\u2019s Day and don\u2019t let this taint it.", "NTA. And as far as I\u2019m concerned even if your mom hadn\u2019t been given dish a short time to live. You\u2019re each entitled to see your own mothers for Mother\u2019s Day. But it\u2019s even more justified in your particular case", "I don\u2019t think your gf\u2019s demand would be reasonable even if your mother were healthy.
