You need and want the time with your Mom, but you also need to do other things for yourself and with others.\n\n2. Your Mom's thoughts on the subject.

The care giving, visits, knowing, and focusing on it all take resources from the survivors and typically in a way that you don't realize until the mental breakdown happens or the death happens and then you are left with recording not only life with that person but with life in general.\n\nMother's Day may or may not be the day to do something different, you're the only one that can answer that.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re requesting she miss mother\u2019s day with her own mother to see yours, going to do things separately with your moms seems like a good compromise.", "NTA. That girlfriend is not worth keeping.", "Your girlfriend is TA... you most definitely are not. The circumstances are different given how much time your Mom has left. She probably deep down truly understands this and if she doesn't, you might have bigger problems.", "OP you offered a completely reasonable setup even if your mother wasn't terminally ill. It's not uncommon for folks who are dating or married to visit their own parents and not spend the day together. This is a completely reasonable expectation and plan. \n\nYour GF sounds very selfish in the matter. If this is truly the first time she's done something like this, it might be worth talking to her and figuring out of there's something else impacting her behavior. To find out if there is there a specific reason why she wants you there. But you would also be valid in communicating that this is your boundary, you will be spending the time with your mother. And if she doesn't like it that may mean a discussion of are you truly a fit together.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "You\u2019re totally NTA\n\nBut I need more info. Why does she want you to go with her?

I'm 6 years married, 11 together and we still go our own ways on mothers/ fathers day. We have no children so it's nice and easy. I'm an only child so if I don't visit then they don't get one.", "NTA!!!! Your GF who I guess up till this point exhibited maturity and empathy is acting oddly out of character. First of all, the outing she described sounds like a girls day out. And her sister and mom would probably feel horrible having you there knowing that this could be your last Mother\u2019s Day with your mother. I\u2019d seriously ask her that if her mom where dying would she want to hang out with your family on what could be the last very important holiday with her mom? If she says yes!

You not only are NTA, but your GF expecting you to give up time with your terminally ill mother makes her TA.

So she wants him to leave *his* mom to go to the movies and dinner with her family? Including her sisters kids? Not to mention with kids it needs to be a kid friendly movie.

If I pressured him into that situation, my mom would chose physical violence on me.", "NTA, at all. Even if your mum was healthy, there is no requirement for you to spend any part of mother's day with your girlfriends mum. Even in that situation it would be NTA for wanting to spend it with your own mum", "This!! THIS!! \nWish I had awards for as this is the the right answer.", "I think it would be fair to skip the chain of communication. Tell the MIL and the sister mayhap in a group chat, expressly that this may be the last mother's day OPs mother has, and his intentions on dedicating that to his own mother.

Maybe her own family or mother could help set her straight. \nI know that when I was just fresh out of the house myself I still felt like a child, duty bound to keeping up with every family holiday and whim like they were somehow mandatory.

It felt so complicated. Although if that were the case it still makes wifes response to being told no inexcusable. \n\nIf the whole family is demanding OP is there under these circumstances, RUN, cause this is sooo callous and narcissistic. If that's the case I'm sure there have been many other situations where OPs feelings have been disregarded. \nOP now that things are clear in your mind and you can see this as what it is do you feel as though your emotions truly matter in your relationship, aside from wife not stopping you from seeing your mom in previous instances.

Cancer just plain sucks all the way around and it can be totally consuming for the patient's loved ones. I have been in her shoes as my husband lost his dad to cancer. As much as I love my husband and his dad and wanted to support them every step of the way, after months of it consuming our entire lives and schedules, the burnout was real. I missed my husband and our normal lives together. I ached for for everyone involved and just wished for life to normal again. She probably just snapped in burned out frustration.

Dying wife is the only thing that I think could really change this in my mind.
