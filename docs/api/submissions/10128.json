What \"stress\" comes from normal high school?\n\nINFO - Does your son have any friends, especially friends his own age? (You didn't mention any social achievements or that he is on par with his peers)... and honestly, I am ambivalent about his academic achievements, though some are wonderful, but I worked with a 16-yo \"homeschooled\" kid while I was in high school who took classes at community college & smug about it, but those classes were inferior to my high school's honors/AP classes, which quickly knocked him down a peg.\n\nCommunity College is much easier than rigorous public or private high school programs, and a lot of musically oriented kids can play 2 instruments.

My friend who is now a music teacher can play over a dozen).\n\nI agree that unschooling is whack, but sheeeeeeeeshhhh none of you should be talking to pregnant women.", "[deleted]", "You have no idea how easy it is to fool the state.

I don\u2019t give him homework. Studies have shown that homework is actually bad for the learning process, and the only reason our schools mandate it, is because there is no way a single teacher, teaching multiple classes for 30+ kids, all with varying comprehension speeds, will be able to effectively make all of them competent in a subject matter without using homework.\n\nMy kid had assignments during learning hours, if they were not finished, we picked them up next period, no doing school work during leisure hours.", ">What \"stress\" comes from normal high school?\n\nHave you been to high school??", "My son has friends his age, I made sure that he did so since he was young (sent him to daycare 2 days a week, signed up for sports and artistic activities that were done in groups, he goes to camp every summer\u2026)\n\ns for his level, I used to be a high school teacher, we follow a curriculum, he is advanced for his age, he is currently doing SATs prep, and is doing great with that.

I believe about half do have the requirement whether its yearly or during certain grades.", "Reminds me of a few people I met in college. One of my friends was homeschooled, very smart 0 social skills. Was very offended when I asked how evaluations went. How did the state know what her competency was to allow her to graduate high school? How did the state know her parents didn't just say yes she's competent? Then she met my other friends who were homeschooled. Also very intelligent, but with better social skills. They informed her \"oh yeah, we were taught reading, writing, basic arithmetic and then we figured everything else out on our own. I didn't really understand science until I was 13 because I didn't want to. My brother didn't do algebra until he was 16 because he didn't like math.\" All were shocked.

My public high school (and all of the surrounding ones) had more $$ than the majority of the private schools, except for the most elite ones.  (Mass shootings happen everywhere, and I believe more often on college campuses and other random places, same w/ sexual assaults - so... ???, though some have absolutely occurred in lower schools). I agree with bullying, but your kid wasn't bullied.  You are responding to ideas and not your son's actual experiences.  Similarly, this baby isn't born.\n\nI agree that unschooling is goofy, but I have not met one homeschooled person (and I've encountered many) that the lack of socialization was a pro for. I'm just saying - you sound smug, and this is parent-centered not kid-centered.", "[deleted]", "yeah, i'd be more okay with it if it was every kid in the state. done just twice- like the end of elementary and the end of high school. and the elementary school was solely to see where kids are and where do they need extra support. \n\nand both could be done almost in sections. 5th grade math. well, if a private school feels their 3rd graders can complete the 5th grade math test after the 3rd grade- fine. you don't need to wait to take the test. and you don't need to take math and language at the same time because different people are at different places academically at different times. let's set everyone up for success. \n\ni took a lot of standardized tests and probably have a few too many feelings on the matter.", "Depends on the state.

In fact, she constantly stressed that it's very hard - which it is. I honestly wouldn't be capable of doing it.

Absolutely. Friendships, learning how to adjust to authority, even possibly learning how to assert himself and stand up for himself. High school is like a jungle. \n\nDo i personally think op is doing the right thing? No, i don't. High school is stressful and if you're dealing with bullying it can be so much worse, but it's still an experience that i think people should have (unless traumatic events happen, of course). \n\n But op asked for judgement on saying what she did to pregnant cousin. And i don't think she is TA for telling her homeschooling is very hard.", "There are WAAY to many standardized test I can 100% agree with that. Some states only require homeschooled students to do evaluations in certain grades and some yearly. I think yearly for all children is too much like you mentioned but I doubt that will change.", "yeah, the tests make them feel in control.\n\nand i'm very- teaching to the test doesn't help kids learn. and when teachers are constantly being told- the students have to do well on this test, their only option is to teach to the test.\n\ni still remember when Florida started having our foreign language teachers do lessons for the FCAT. it was the most ridiculous thing ever.", "NTA. As a homeschooler myself who was schooled how you school your son, you were correct in stating the truth to the other person. Homeschooling can make certain things easier, but it's not \"easy\" in and of itself. \nPeople like your SIL are the ones who give homeschooling a bad rap.", "NTA. Truth is an absolute defense.", "NTA she\u2019s right that unschooling is super easy but forgot it borders on neglect.", "I think you are NTA. Your opinion on homeschooling reflects your own experience, and that's perfectly valid.\n\nHowever, I think it's important to remember that it's your experience, and that is not universal. No, it is not always extremely hard to homeschool. It takes thought, yes. It absolutely can take work, yes.\n\nBut you do not always have to do it all yourself, and therefore get a good grasp of every subject. You don't even have to balance your role and parent and teacher unless you have chosen to homeschool in a way that puts a barrier between learning from teacher mom vs. learning from parent mom. Many people do it differently.\n\nI homeschooled my kids as well (they are both grown now). I did it in multiple states and have seen some very different homeschooling practices, many of which ended up creating children who had a good education, even with very different methods and levels of effort. Some parents put in a lot of effort, and some put in much less.\n\nI think a lot of effort is saved when people can collaborate and be part of the community when they are trying to help their kids learn skills.\n\nJust for some examples, in most homeschooling groups I knew, people traded skills.\n\nOne mom from Mexico offered free Spanish lessons to anyone interested. Another ex-math teacher was willing to teach middle and high school level math, another geography, another local history. This was done at parks, in homes, during playdates, or online.\n\nOne homeschooler I know asked a much older seamstress friend to teach their child sewing, and then the kid also learned woodworking from that woman's husband, who had made their entire house from the ground up.\n\nI know another child who was so enamored of wood working that he apprenticed with someone who made furniture and got a career from that. Some joined dance troupes, or took local art classes, etc...\n\nWe parents don't have to do it all alone, as long as we're willing to trust that other people may be able to offer something good to our kids. Because homeschooling isn't equivalent with 'all main topics are from parents.' It just means the learning is not done in a school.\n\nThat doesn't mean that doing it mostly by ourselves is wrong. I'm not saying that. But it's just 'one' way of doing things rather than 'the' way of doing things.\n\nBut it also sounds like your in-law is presenting THEIR way of doing things as the only way, as well, in a much less realistic way, so your views on this seem like a good contrast for the person you were talking to. So again, NTA.", "Nta and she is failing her kids. Doesn't matter that she's mom and she gets to choose her parenting. There are limits and no one should defend a parent that is failing their children like this.", "NTA.

But\u2026.it was for 3rd and 4th grade (after some behavioral issues) so it was and should have been on the easier side. After that well I put him back in school. He needed more socialization with other children his age and I feel like he was better able to enjoy school. I don\u2019t think I would have done a good job on the harder subjects and it would have been wrong of me to keep him at home with me no matter how much I enjoyed the time with him working on assignments together. \n\nYou did the right thing by telling the truth. No one should get into homeschooling without some thought.", "NTA but im curious - since you have to plan the curriculum for all subjects, how did you plan for the subjects you didn't have special expertise in?", "I am lucky that we could afford to pay for classes for some things. For example, I only speak English (barely, as grammar is my enemy), so all those languages were the result of classes. Same goes for a lot of other things. I only taught what you would consider basic/general subjects.\n\nI was not lucky enough to be part of a good group, as most of the ones I tried to join seemed closer to my SIL\u2019s idea of homeschooling, than they did mine", "You don't seem to understand that it may be easy for some and they still do a great job.", "Not sure if it\u2019s worth mentioning, but k-12 is a public school education done at home.", "There's an overwhelming smug tone of \"my kid is great, my niece & nephew are a hot mess\", and a lot of bragging.

Our actual final was a full house plan, including electric overlays and roofing and siding and full elevation. Not something easily converted to a multiple choice exam, tbh. \n\n2-5: AP lit, bio, stats, government. All of which had actual finals.... A month and a half before school ended. Because the AP exams were 5 weeks before school ended. So the teaching period for that class was done in April. Which is when we took the final. I still remember my bio final was \"deleted\" by my teacher's toddler in protest. \n\n6: upper level band. Our final was the spring concert. It wasn't a music theory class, that was a different thing (we had one, just not what I was in). My class was all playing, not theory.

Finals were a month later.\n\nBut you were done- you had to be done by early May. you literally spent a month watching movies. what were they going to test us on? what movies we'd watched in the last month?\n\n(Also, made props to my AP Calc teacher who thought it was ridiculous that 94+ was an A and applied the rule to every senior who had at least a 90.)", "NTA-people like that give homeschooling a bad name", "What is unschooling? \n\nNTA\n\nWhat is her plans for her kids when they are adults? Jobs? Staying home forever?", "I was homeschooled. I have a cousin who was unschooled (in a way that wasn't like, actively detrimental to her future.) Even when done properly (which your SIL isn't doing) they're not the same thing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you were just giving your opinion and honestly dang do you have any pointers on raising children because I wanna know what you do \ud83d\ude05 to get your child to tht level . You can tell you put a lot of work into a child on how far he\u2019s come.", "You asked if you were the asshole for \u201cprovoking her.\u201d So if you did that intentionally \u2014 and it sounds from what you wrote that you did \u2014 you are sort of an AH. You got defensive and somewhat arrogant. Why do you care what she thinks about the difficulty of homeschooling?", "When he was younger, it was very easy, since the knowledge I had to teach was close to common knowledge, or easy to learn.\n\nWe he got older, he was signed in classes in some academies (languages, music and a handful of subjects he was interested in, like auto mechanics), he had a tutor for English and lit, to have up to standard (because I am hopeless).\n\nWe are lucky that we make enough to be able to do that. But I know people who are in homeschool groups who take on different subjects.", "My son has never expressed that he wants to go to school. He has classes outside of our house, and he likes the way I teach", "I tried, apparent it\u2019s not illegal. They are well taken care of, she loves them (no mental abuse), and sadly, not teaching them is not a form of abuse.", "So here are the broad strokes of how I teach my kid:\n\n- for STEM related subjects, I just broadly follow the state mandated curriculum for public schools, the pro of one on one teaching, is that we advance at his speed alone, which makes it faster because my kid has an affinity for those subjects. The most difficulty I had, was in getting most items (especially chemical materials) needed for experiments.\n\n- for geography, history (including world history) and related subjects, I followed this model: we chose a country, he has a week to do some research on it (to teach him how to do research and write essays), then we do a deep dive, we start by studying the geography, then the history, the religion, the socioeconomic makeup, the governance model\u2026. This kills many birds with one stone. The US took us a long time, because we studied each state on its own, and we went more in depth into the whole political makeup of our country.\n\n- for English and literature, he had a tutor. I am hopeless in that subject, and we are lucky enough to be able to afford it.\n\n- languages, he was in classes in an academy (Spanish, Italian and German), because I can barely speak English. Same goes for music.\n\n- I made sure to put him sports (whatever he chose when he was younger and wanting to try everything, then he stuck with soccer and taekwondo when he was older), send him to daycare 2 times a week when he was younger and send him to camp each summer, so he can have enough socialization. We tried Boy Scouts, he did not like it.\n\nHope it helps.", "We homeschooled for a very short time due to some personal circumstances that we thought our kids would do better being at home than at school. \n\nIt was a fight to get them baseline tested at the beginning of the year, and no one ever asked for anything to prove what we were doing.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t cheap and it wasn\u2019t easy. I spent a lot of time on Teachers Pay Teachers figuring out what we were doing. NTA.", "\ud83d\udc4d would it matter if he did? My cousins were forced into homeschooling. They had all cut contact with my aunt by the time they were 21.", "If he wanted to go to school? We would have done our best to send him to a good private school. We are gentle parenting, and respecting his opinion when it comes to his life and decisions is very important to us.", "NTA.\n\nFirst I\u2019d like to congratulate your SIL for ruining her children\u2019s future and contributing to future welfare rolls.\n\nI\u2019m now retired but I used to be a college professor. Obviously the homeschooled kids who get into a university are taught fairly well academically. They\u2019re no more weak in certain subjects than formally schooled kids generally are. Their biggest struggle lies with social skills. They tend to have problems in working with others. Socializing with others isn\u2019t usually the issue, but actually working with others is.\n\nI used to live in Missoula, Montana which has a very strong, very active home school community. My niece was a part of that. My niece is college educated and is the daughter of a school teacher, so she was well aware of the need to prepare and plan. She worked really hard at it for her two boys. The other moms in her group appeared to do the same, often coming together to co-teach (where someone who was strong in math would teach math while the other, strong in English composition would teach English, for example). They went on field trips and had their kids do projects together. If anyone was doing it right, my niece was. But as the boys got older she began to see they were missing out on certain things she felt she couldn\u2019t adequately provide. She and her husband made the decision to transfer the boys to traditional school. Home schooling isn\u2019t easy. If it is you aren\u2019t doing it right. Teaching is a true profession. My hat is off to you for working so hard to do it right!\n\nThank you for giving your husband\u2019s cousin the honest truth.", "NTA for what you said but if her children are 14 and 10 and barely read them she needs to be reported to CPS because that is abuse!!", "NTA at all. Unschooling doesn't mean you don't teach your children! I fully believe in the unschooling ethos and plan to do that with my own children, but people like this give it a bad name.", "NTA. You gave your opinion. Nothing wrong with that", "NTA you are not wrong.  Her kids are going to be at a real disadvantage.", "Your SIL is a dangerous person to society and should be reminded of it everyday. What she is doing is child abuse, you should call CPS not come.here", "NTA can't social services do something for the kids?", "That's what I wanted to know! Im afraid to Google it."]}
