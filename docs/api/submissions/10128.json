It\u2019s a huge job when done right, just like you said. It\u2019s about being prepared, diligent, and accountable. You have your children\u2019s future in your hands.

What \"stress\" comes from normal high school?\n\nINFO - Does your son have any friends, especially friends his own age? (You didn't mention any social achievements or that he is on par with his peers)... and honestly, I am ambivalent about his academic achievements, though some are wonderful, but I worked with a 16-yo \"homeschooled\" kid while I was in high school who took classes at community college & smug about it, but those classes were inferior to my high school's honors/AP classes, which quickly knocked him down a peg.\n\nCommunity College is much easier than rigorous public or private high school programs, and a lot of musically oriented kids can play 2 instruments. (My brother can play 4, and he learned one. My friend who is now a music teacher can play over a dozen).\n\nI agree that unschooling is whack, but sheeeeeeeeshhhh none of you should be talking to pregnant women.", "[deleted]", "You have no idea how easy it is to fool the state. I know for a fact that the curriculum and outlines my sister submits are printed off a website, changed a bit and sent away.

Especially when kids are still young, the amount of time I have spent trying to plan how to introduce and teach any given topic to my kid is just overwhelming, more than I had to do when I had 30+ kids in my classes.", "An aside, the greatest thing about homeschooling my kid? I don\u2019t give him homework. Studies have shown that homework is actually bad for the learning process, and the only reason our schools mandate it, is because there is no way a single teacher, teaching multiple classes for 30+ kids, all with varying comprehension speeds, will be able to effectively make all of them competent in a subject matter without using homework.\n\nMy kid had assignments during learning hours, if they were not finished, we picked them up next period, no doing school work during leisure hours.", ">What \"stress\" comes from normal high school?\n\nHave you been to high school??", "My son has friends his age, I made sure that he did so since he was young (sent him to daycare 2 days a week, signed up for sports and artistic activities that were done in groups, he goes to camp every summer\u2026)\n\ns for his level, I used to be a high school teacher, we follow a curriculum, he is advanced for his age, he is currently doing SATs prep, and is doing great with that. Like I said, he is on track for early admission to some great colleges. \n\nI don\u2019t claim that is a genius, but he is more advanced than students I had that were his age, but not as advanced as some others.\n\nAs for what stress is there is high schools, what planet are you living on? Beyond one problem that starts with mass that I can\u2019t mention here, and another one that is an alarming statistic that will get me banned for even mentioning, bullying is an issue, the volume of hours they study is an issue, the school hours are in contradiction with their biology, the class numbers, the lack of funding, some real propaganda that is being taught in school\u2026.", "She didn't made comments about Sil parenting, she answered a question about her own parenting. \n\n>keep your opinions to yourself\n\n The cousin literally asked her an opinion about homeschooling kids, and op spoke from her experience. She never said \"sil does it wrong\". \n\n>she doesn't have the necessary skills or knowledge it takes to educate her children.\n\nShe just said (here, not to the cousin) that sil's kids can barely read. Her kids are 10 and 14. Does that seem good to you? And again, op only wrote that here, she didn't made any comment to the cousin.", "Eh op was asked about her opinion on homeschooling. She gave it and it contradicted what her sil said. Op didn\u2019t say yea sil not good at it or something else. She gave an honest opinion to someone who asked for it.", "This is why I wish more states required homeschooled students to participate in annual testing or evaluation.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of standardized tests as I think data-wise they don't tell us much about learning other than memorization....in cases like your SIL it would speak volumes, especially for reading and writing as you can't memorize that as much. \n\nThere are also better sources of evaluation that could be used states just don't. I believe about half do have the requirement whether its yearly or during certain grades.", "Reminds me of a few people I met in college. One of my friends was homeschooled, very smart 0 social skills. Was very offended when I asked how evaluations went. How did the state know what her competency was to allow her to graduate high school? How did the state know her parents didn't just say yes she's competent? Then she met my other friends who were homeschooled. Also very intelligent, but with better social skills. They informed her \"oh yeah, we were taught reading, writing, basic arithmetic and then we figured everything else out on our own. I didn't really understand science until I was 13 because I didn't want to. My brother didn't do algebra until he was 16 because he didn't like math.\" All were shocked. The two shrugged and went \"the state didn't check and our parents didn't teach us. They wanted us to teach ourselves.\" All of them are doing pretty ok though. All things considered.", "Thing is, you were trained to be a teacher, so you know what needs to happen to teach something, even if it is outside your field. \n\nDon't they do any checks on home schooners where you are? Student progress, curriculum requirements etc.?", "I'm asking her why she is blanket stating that it is \"stressful\" b/c it can be, but unless a kid is going through an extreme hardship (severe bullying or whatever), it's typically not worth removing them entirely.\n\nEDIT: She is projecting things onto her own son and some unborn future child that don't exist yet.", ">As for what stress is there is high schools, what planet are you living on?

My public high school (and all of the surrounding ones) had more $$ than the majority of the private schools, except for the most elite ones.  (Mass shootings happen everywhere, and I believe more often on college campuses and other random places, same w/ sexual assaults - so... ???, though some have absolutely occurred in lower schools). I agree with bullying, but your kid wasn't bullied.  You are responding to ideas and not your son's actual experiences.  Similarly, this baby isn't born.\n\nI agree that unschooling is goofy, but I have not met one homeschooled person (and I've encountered many) that the lack of socialization was a pro for. I'm just saying - you sound smug, and this is parent-centered not kid-centered.", "[deleted]", "yeah, i'd be more okay with it if it was every kid in the state. done just twice- like the end of elementary and the end of high school. and the elementary school was solely to see where kids are and where do they need extra support. \n\nand both could be done almost in sections. 5th grade math. well, if a private school feels their 3rd graders can complete the 5th grade math test after the 3rd grade- fine. you don't need to wait to take the test. and you don't need to take math and language at the same time because different people are at different places academically at different times. let's set everyone up for success. \n\ni took a lot of standardized tests and probably have a few too many feelings on the matter.", "Depends on the state. For some states, just sending them a copy of your curriculum is enough. And those you can print off of the internet, no need to think or do any research. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s someone standing over you making sure that you are actually teaching the kids, and not just letting them run wild.", "a lot of states have very little if any requirements for home schooling. it's very much the wild west.", ">some unborn future child that don't exist yet.\n\nShe just answered some questions, didn't told the mom to homeschool him. In fact, she constantly stressed that it's very hard - which it is. I honestly wouldn't be capable of doing it. And i don't mean the teaching per se only, i mean all the paperwork that must be submitted to the state to show gow you homeschool them. \n\n>unless a kid is going through an extreme hardship (severe bullying or whatever),\n\n Does he lose some experiences by not going to high school? Absolutely. Friendships, learning how to adjust to authority, even possibly learning how to assert himself and stand up for himself. High school is like a jungle. \n\nDo i personally think op is doing the right thing? No, i don't. High school is stressful and if you're dealing with bullying it can be so much worse, but it's still an experience that i think people should have (unless traumatic events happen, of course). \n\n But op asked for judgement on saying what she did to pregnant cousin. And i don't think she is TA for telling her homeschooling is very hard.", "There are WAAY to many standardized test I can 100% agree with that. Some states only require homeschooled students to do evaluations in certain grades and some yearly. I think yearly for all children is too much like you mentioned but I doubt that will change.", "yeah, the tests make them feel in control.\n\nand i'm very- teaching to the test doesn't help kids learn. and when teachers are constantly being told- the students have to do well on this test, their only option is to teach to the test.\n\ni still remember when Florida started having our foreign language teachers do lessons for the FCAT. it was the most ridiculous thing ever."]}
