Knowing I wouldn't have time to get my hair done in my hometown, I researched a salon 2 weeks in advance in town to get it done. \n\nThe week before, I saw that on that day I would have a very tight schedule and I couldn't be late in the salon. I sent a message asking if my 1 hour schedule would be enough and not having delays. The salon girls said yes. Basically cut a little and dry (my hair is on my shouldrt and lacks volume). Asked again 1 day before to be sure, becausa I couldn't be late, same answer.\n\n\nI arrived 10 minutes before te schedule and even so, the hairdresser attended to me 15 minutes\n\nThis is where the situation begins: \n\nThe girl, every time she talks to others, she stopped cutting my hair for a time and come back, then stop again (and she talked a Lot) (added and edited), basically not even half of my hair on 25 (ops my mistake) minutes and the other half still needed to cut. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes and she just started fiddling with the other half, I said \"Hey, I have something after this and I have limited time, could you focus here?\" she got quiet and finished cutting.\n\n There were 5 minutes left t and I said that I wouldn't need to dry my hair, because I would be very late.\n\n They didn't say much, but when I mentioned it to my friends, some pointed out how rude I was and that I shouldn't be surprised about delays at the hair salon even more so in the week of Christmas (22).\n\nSorry for the time guys,  I will correct because I may have been wrong, but basically she finished cutting everything 5 minutes before my schedule ended\n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1671946916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuro5i/aita_for_asking_my_hairdresser_to_focus_and/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You requested to be done within 1 hour and confirmed about it more than you should have to....and yet, she was not fully taking care of you..

Having a conversation and pausing a haircut repeatedly to be distracted is not a delay, thats a failure to do her job. \n\n> The week before, I saw that on that day I would have a very tight schedule and I couldn't be late in the salon. I sent a message asking if my 1 hour schedule would be enough and not having delays.

Asked again 1 day before to be sure, becausa I couldn't be late, same answer. \n\nA minor hair cut does not take that long. If she couldn't keep her word, she should have said no. If it was a fancy haircut, it'd be different. But a minor cut does not take an hour.", "NTA\n\nI really don't understand these answers stating that going to a salon means time and schedules go out the window. Not everyone has the luxury of not worrying about time. Obviously getting color can make time estimates a little tricky, but you weren't getting anything complicated done and you tried confirming that one hour would be enough. \n\nIt's not like you were rushing her while she was cutting, she was just wasting time instead of focusing on her client. If she can't chat with others while also cutting hair, it's her issue, not yours for speaking up.", "Former stylist here, 35+ yrs in the business. Unless your stylist was a newbie, she should have been able to finish a shampoo, cut & blow dry within 45 minutes. The only time I ever booked longer than that was if I was providing extra styling (curling or straightening), or an up-do. It's unfortunate that you had to speak up with your stylist, but she needs to focus on her clients. NTA.", ">when I mentioned it to my friends, some pointed out how rude I was and that I shouldn't be surprised about delays at the hair salon even more so in the week of Christmas \n\nNTA Did your friends even listen to what you said? This isn't about some kind of inevitable delay, it was about the hairdresser not taking their job or what you said seriously and spending too much time time chatting and not working. Even if you hadn't specifically told them you were on a tight schedule it still would have been rude.\n\nI get that some people are rude to those in the service industries, and some people are sensitive to that fact, but reflexively defending workers even to the point of ignoring the facts of the story, and inserting excuses that don't actually apply, is not justified.", "NTA I bleach my hair a lot. My hair doesn't bleach well. If my hairdresser says 4 hours (sounds long but isn't for me) you bet your butt I'm gone in that time or less. She was disrespectful to your time, and frankly, shouldn't be talking to others if she can't multitask.", "NTA in my opinion. Maybe it's not socially acceptable to speak up for yourself? But I think given the fact that you told them beforehand you were on a tight schedule and they said it could be completed in the hour, you're not in the wrong for asking the hairdresser to stay on track. This is why I hate salons lol. Like come on guys can you at least act like I'm paying for a service here", "NTA but you should have reminded her politely earlier.", "NTA based on what you shared, you weren\u2019t rude. It sounds like you went a little overboard checking beforehand, but nothing that actually makes you TA. Personally when I have a hair appointment, I try never to plan anything pressing immediately afterwards because I want the stylists to be able to do their best work without being rushed. (I get balayage, so it\u2019s very time-consuming and expensive.) I also just enjoy talking and playing girlfriends with them when I\u2019m being styled. Again NTA, but you might have enjoyed yourself and gotten better service if you hadn\u2019t been so tightly scheduled.", "You were just getting a cut and dry? Then definitely NTA. If you were getting a dye job or something that involves a lot of wait time, I could see her socializing in between. But a cut and dry shouldn\u2019t involve leaving and coming back.", "NTA: I fired my facialist same reason, she couldn't spend 30 minutes with me without constantly texting and talking to people outside the room and generally living her life as if I wasn't there.", "NTA - for expecting her to do her job without interruptions, and for wanting to get in and out in a timely fashion, but...don't piss off someone who is handling your food or cutting your hair.", "NTA. The problem with hair and nail salons is that they're gossip hubs. You were right to tell her to focus on the task at hand. A hair appointment is not a gabfest.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't demanding with your request and you mentioned you were on a tight schedule. I don't think that you did anything wrong. \n\nI stopped going to a local hairdresser because of a similar issue; I had one appointment where another customer was getting a complicated treatment done and the focus was entirely on them, including the person cutting my own hair. They kept going over and watching how it was done, joining in the conversation about it and offering advice as the customer's long thick hair was causing issues. \n\nI get that they wanted to help but what should have been half an hour tops was over an hour and a half because of the constant interruptions.", "NTA It isn't just about the time, it is also about the concentration. If she always stops ang do something else, she isn't really concentrated on what she did and still needs to be done. And a simple haircut doesn't need one hour. You are her paying customer, you need to be her priority.", "NTA if she wants to talk to her coworkers she needs to be able to multitask my stylist has never stopped doing my hair to talk to someone she is always able to do both at once.", "NTA. I hope you didn't tip.", "Unsure honestly. I also have never met a hairdresser that couldn't talk and cut hair at the same time too.", "Hmmm you told her you were under a time constraint but haircuts are not something you should rush. IMO she shouldn't have told you she could do it in under an hour and you should not have expected a \"good\" cut and style in under an hour", "Listen, I very much understand that you needed a haircut, but if you couldn't have it done by your normal hair stylist and you have thin, fine hair like mine, YTA if you make someone rush and your hair is not the way you want it. There is a learning curve to each person's hair. Sometimes a stylist steps away to ask a more experienced stylist something.\n\nDo not go to the salon when you do not have ample time for salon time. My salon time is sacred and I make sure to keep a 3 hour time window! Give your stylist time!", "YTA. \nYou spoke to her like you would speak to a child.  You should\u2019ve just emphasized that you had a very tight time constraint, rather than trying to dictate her behavior.  Don\u2019t schedule things so tightly next time.", "ESH but mostly YTA\n\nYou should never go to a salon when you have such a strict time restraint. And if her chatting around (like stylists do) bothered you so much you shouldn\u2019t have waited 55 minutes to say something. You waited until basically last second to let her know it bothered you instead of when it started.", "YTA - you are getting your hair cut at a new salon when you have a very tight schedule.  That is just asking for problems.\n\nYou also didn\u2019t tell the hairdresser at the start of your appointment your time crunch.  The onus is on you to communicate that with the person doing the work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  I have many friends who are hairdressers, a couple of them have owned their own business for decades.  A little-known fact among the customers is that when you go to get your hair done, you aren't just paying for a haircut.  You are paying for touch.  All human beings crave skin on skin touch with other human beings.  Now obviously, stylists are not prostitutes.  Well, there are some rare exceptions there.  But legitimate cosmetologists (99.99%) are still providing customers with physical human contact, in addition to cutting / styling hair.\n\nSome of them go the extra mile, mainly because it leads to higher tips.  For example, a standard cut might include a shampoo.  During the shampoo, they might give you a \\*scalp massage\\* for a few minutes.  If they are good at it, it can be a very pleasant experience, literally relaxing you to the point where you fall asleep.  If they can style your hair well in addition to that, can you imagine how well they do with tips?  It's not unheard of for the tip to exceed the cost of service.  Better professionals have figured that out a long time ago.\n\nSo now you know what the pros know, it is easier to figure out why they seem unrushed / unhurried sometimes.  They want the clients to be relaxed and feel good as this often leads to higher tips.  So it takes an extra 5 minutes or even 20 minutes?  So what?  One good tip can easily exceed several small tips.  It's better to have big tippers than lots of customers you rush through for minimal tips.\n\nAnd the average customer is in no hurry.  I mean, sure...we all have hectic schedules.  But hair day is kind of a slow day, usually.  If we aren't relaxed when we ARRIVE at the hair salon, then we really don't have time to get our hair done that day anyway.\n\nNow you said you called ahead and were told that one hour would be enough.  They led you to believe one hour would be enough.  Well yes, one hour would be about right for an average haircut, if it was rushed.  But here's something else you aren't aware of.  Rarely is the cosmetologist the one who answers the phone.\n\nMost likely, what happened is...you reached the front desk girl who knew (from experience) that the service you were asking for COULD be completed in a short time.  Then you got assigned to a cosmetologist who was operating under normal, non-rushed conditions.  And she honestly was trying to give you the best service that she personally could provide.  That meant not worrying about the clock much.\n\nIn context, what you said came across as rude, like you were questioning her competence.  They go slow for two reasons.  They would rarely be asked to speed up, and it's not in the customer's best interest for them to do so.", "Nta but with that attitude i hope you tipped well", "I'd say nta, but the way you phrased your timing was rude. You could have told her at the beginning of the cut (because a lot of receptionists I've worked with are pretty bad at communicating of simple things like reminding the stylist a time constraint) but you could have said something along the lines of \"hey, I'm sorry I have a limited time today but I really need to be out of here by x time\" if a client ever told me \"to focus\" I'd be pretty mad. (But also I can talk and cut hair at the same time-unless its crazy shaved designs or something then I trail off)", "It's also quite insulting to stylists who know exactly how long they take to perform specific services, their livelihood depends on it. If they book 10, 30min appointments and take an hour to do each, their nice day turns into a 10+ hour nightmare with screaming clients. Why would they book themselves that way? \n\nA stylist is a professional, professionals give accurate quotes on how long and how much a job takes. If they don't, they're not any good at their job. (Yes circumstances change, like a job that was more complex than presented, this is not that)", "Finally, someone here with some sense.", "But OP didn't want a cut and style, OP just wanted a cut and dry. Simple cuts don't take ages unless the hairdresser is wasting most of that time talking and not working.\n\nAnd if they couldn't keep to an hour, then they should not have told OP that an hour would be fine.", "I agree with what you wrote, except...in the better salons, the girl answering the phone is rarely the girl who is cutting your hair.  So I expect there was a lack of communication that led to a misunderstanding.", "she gave her stylist time, and the stylist wasted it. leaving your client for upwards of 10 minutes multiple times in the middle of a cut to socialize with *someone else\u2019s client* is wildly unacceptable in a professional salon environment. an hour is completely normal for wash/dry with a trim on a non-textured client with appropriate time management.", ">You should never\n\n\nReally?", "she told the receptionist explicitly, and it was the receptionists responsibility to communicate that to the stylist\u2014not the client. the receptionist is there for a reason.", "this is probably one of the most biased and out of touch responses i\u2019ve seen in an AITA response. leaving your client for 10-15 minutes at a time is not \u201ctaking your time\u201d, it\u2019s being unprofessional. especially if the client has wet hair. having a side conversation is one thing, abandoning your client is another. the only appropriate situation for leaving your client for an extended period of time is if you\u2019re doing a colour process\u2014and even then that needs intermittent monitoring and that MUST take priority over socialising, at the risk of causing serious damage to a clients hair. forcing a client to leave with an unfinished service (in this case, wet hair\u2014when a full service was booked) because of poor time management is unacceptable. you do not \u201cknow what the pros know\u201d if you think this is at all appropriate.\n\nthe hairdresser in question WAS being incompetent. OP was being rude, but it was well deserved. she \nset a clear boundary around the time frame, which the receptionist would have communicated to the stylist. the stylist ignored that. and even if it wasn\u2019t\u2026yikes. NTA, OP. i would leave a review and contact their manager about your experience\u2014it\u2019s likely this is a pattern with this stylist and they need to know that clients come first.", "I understand that, the situation was her in the middle of the cut , someone talks to her, she stops cutting, talks and comes back All this so many times\n\n\n The conversation was not with me but with another client and another hairdresser. Yes, I believe that quality is important and everyone has their time to make a cut, but it was clear that the conversation was delaying the cut, because I stopped counting at the 10th stop on 5 minutes.", "I really don't understand this. I think tipping culture has warped people's thinking, even those who try to be considerate to workers -- some overcompensate, tipping well no matter what, as if the customer were in a subservient position. That's not a healthy respect for others; it's going too far the other way.\n\nI fail to see how this person deserves to be \"tipped well\" because she had to suffer being very mildly reminded to actually do her job instead of acting like she was giving a free cut to a friend in her kitchen with the main activity being having fun chatting with everyone.", "out of curiosity, what\u2019s your type/length/texture?", "I've stopped letting stylists touch my hair because if there's one thing they can't do, it's their job. \n\nIf you can learn to do your own hair, you should. It's worthwhile. My hair never looked how I wanted it to until I started cutting it myself, and it takes much less time. \n\nIt's not a quality issue when the problem is that they literally aren't doing their job."]}
