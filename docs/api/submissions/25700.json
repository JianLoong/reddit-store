He didn\u2019t need or want anything specific. I don\u2019t think you need to even offer him a reason as to why you didn\u2019t reply. You don\u2019t owe him anything. He knew you were busy.

He might be under the impression that if they were closer, they might be together.", "It is. Because he knew she was busy beforehand. And just because somebody texts or calls you, you are not obligated to answer. She could have very well just need a break if they communicate daily.

If a partner is being neglected, has repeated grounds for suspecting unfaithfulness or if there was a serious breach of trust.\n\nThis guy is not your partner though, so it felt weird that he showed behavior as if he was.", "Some of them do make it seem like you can still be friends, but it's only because they want to keep trying for more. I had one like this and he would do really hurtful things to me just to get a reaction, he would rather start an argument with me to have that interaction rather than have no interaction at all. It really messed with my head.", "The same NTA. You were busy.", "What part about \"He's much more of an asshole, to an absurd degree\" are you not picking up on-", "I get that.

He knows for important comms to call not text.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"for texting back 3 hours later to an unimportant message?\" .. **if you feel you need to answer that fast, that is fine.** Taking longer would be ok, too.", "NTA available or not available is a matter of personal autonomy.", "NTA If you're an asshole for taking 3 hours to text back then I'm quite possibly the worst person ever lol", "NTA. Does he know that you are single? Sounds like he thinks he snuck himself a girlfriend.", "Nta, heck your nicer than I am. Lol sometimes I don't respond back for days.  I actually think he wants more with you. Probably jealous of you being out with other people even if it's just friends.", "NTA. Sorry I felt your comment about being single was amusing as I am in a similar situation. Single and yet you still have someone who expects you to constantly message them. On a serious note, he seems controlling as a friend... I expect people not to message when they are working or out.", "NTA.", "NTA, that\u2019s crazy. My best friend and I text every day, it\u2019s rare that we go a full day with neither of us texting the other. But neither of us expects responses within a certain timeframe either because we both have lives and stuff we need to do outside of responding to texts.", "Same.  I always say to my family if they need me now to call.  Otherwise I will reply when I am free. That may be 10 minutes or 5hrs depending on what I am doing.

To be clear, I don\u2019t believe 3 hours is an unreasonable delay before responding to a single word text. I also don\u2019t appreciate being subjected to your criticism, disapproval and judgement. We do not and will never have the type of relationship where that type of behaviour is acceptable. You can adjust your expectations and accept that this is the standard or just don\u2019t text me at all\u201d. You could also just text \u201cNever contact me again\u201d and block him. I\u2019m also suspecting there is another reason you have for delaying responding to this guy. NTA", "He is starting to make you feel uncomfortable. It is now time to end this friendship.", "Why are you stringing this guy along. Sorry but YTA, you need to end this friendship if you know he has a romantic interest and that it won\u2019t work out. Are you just using him for validation?", "I don't even always text my partner back immediately. We both have busy lives, and if it is urgent he knows to call and not send a text."]}
