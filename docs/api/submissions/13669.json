To me, it's a little weird that she expects you to pay for her dates ngl.  NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing the opposite of controlling her: you\u2019re telling her she can do whatever she wants, as long as she understands the consequences of her actions. Going on expensive dates means having less money in the bank. She doesn\u2019t have to go on expensive dates; she has all the freedom in the world to go to a park or trade books in a library. \n\nBy demanding that you pay for her fun time, she\u2019s trying to control you. It\u2019s extortion.", "NTA - Why would you ever pay for your kid's dates?", "Wait... wtf\n\nSo your adult daughter (who has the benefit of tuition, board, food, entertainment,  paid by you) is telling you that your refusal to bankroll her dates with her boyfriend is you being controlling?\n\nYes, you should have reservations about a boyfriend that is ok with someone else paying for his dates.\n\nI think you have an entitled daughter who has mixed herself up with a leech (who knows if he gave her the idea of you being controlling or she takes all the credit for that stupid idea). Make sure the money you give her is actually going to tuition and such. I've known people to drop classes to get the refund and blow it on something else.\n\nNTA", "NTA she should have more than enough money to pay for herself since you pay for her to live.", "NTA. She is the age of an adult, but apparently as mature as a 16 year old.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the entitlement for me, thinks you\u2019re trying to control her LOL", "NTA\n\nWhy should you pay for her dates?  That is between the two of them, not you.", "NTA and WHAT?????? I have never ever in the history of ever heard of a father paying for his daughters dates.  Die on this hill.", "NTA she should be paying for 100% of her entertainment costs no matter who she is with. Part time jobs & a summer job should cover this. You are being too generous.", "NTA... at least,  not an asshole for saying what you said to her.  Possibly an asshole for bringing your daughter up to be an entitled young person.", "NTA. Wow your daughter is beyond entitled. I've never heard of parents paying for their adult children's dates or most entertainment for that matter.  In fact many people have to get student loans for college.", "NTA. If she\u2019s grown up enough to date someone, she\u2019s grown up enough to pay for at least her portion. If she\u2019s expecting parents to pay for their date, then neither of them are mature enough to date at all.", "NTA. She works she can pay for it. Honestly pretty straightforward. Her saying you're trying to control her is pretty BS. Letting someone use their own money for what they want is not controlling lol", "NTA you do you. She should be happy with everything she's already getting.", "NTA\n\naanndd this is why is bad to continue to financially support your adult children", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t  understand how this is something she feels entitled to. Yiu are supporting her and she has part time jobs. When I was a student dates consisted of whatever we could afford that was cheap. There is generally lots of free or cheap stuff. We didn\u2019t have expectations of dining out or other expensive stuff until we were working and even then oniy what we could afford.", "I'm sorry, what!? \n\nAlthough it's nice when parents help their children to pay for college, it's not required. You're spending thousands of dollars to support her already. Of course she would bankroll her own dates. If she wants to go on them, then she can pay for them.\n\nObviously you're NTA. Show her this thread so she can learn it's not mommy and daddy's responsibility to finance her romantic relationships.", "Huh? She's an adult, why would you pay for her dates..?", "Frankly, I\u2019d stop the support after tuition and room and board. If she wants entertainment money, she can get a job and use her money from that. She\u2019s an adult. I stopped getting fun money from my parents when I started working at 16. NTA", "NTA \n\nI highly suggest that you stop paying for her entertainment completely and slowly start cutting back on her other expenses  to where you are only paying her tuition.   She needs to learn to be financially responsible.   Slowly cutting off your funding will do this, but she will still have the safety net of your help on crucial things.", "NTA - why on earth would anyone pay for their daughter's dates anyway?", "NTA By not paying for your adult daughter to go on dates, you\u2019re helping her learn how to manage her money. If she spends too much on dates and runs short, that will teach her how to make better financial decisions in the future. You are already paying for more items than many parents would for a 22-year-old.", "If you're going on the date too, think about paying.  Other than that, nah! She's grown. She can pay.", "I wouldn't pay for entertainment", "NTA. \n\nYou cover her needs, she gets to cover her wants. If she doesn\u2019t want to spend money then she will need to come up with date ideas that don\u2019t cost money; just like every other broke college kid lol.", "Wow, what a great loophole \u2014 if you don\u2019t give me free money for something then you\u2019re controlling!  I can\u2019t wait to find someone stupid enough to buy this argument!  NTA", "Either you pay for her entertainment or you don\u2019t, which is both fine considering she\u2019s an adult and also works several jobs, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s up to her how she spends any budgets available to her.", "If you'd pay if you didn't have reservations about the bf, you're controlling her. If you wouldn't pay under any circumstances, it's perfectly fine.\nSo INFO.", "INFO: is this a new policy? Are you fine with paying for her to go out with friends, or by herself, or with previous boyfriends you liked better?", "Why would the boyfriend be paying for both of them? She can help too she\u2019s has a job and is a member of society", "INFO:\n\nDo you pay for the same activities if she does them eith someone else?\n\nI don't think you are obligated to pay for her dates, but that doesn't mean she's wrong that you are trying to control her.", "You can do what you want. But wouldn't dating someone fall under entertainment?", "Info: are you saying you won't be giving her EXTRA money for her dates? Or you're going to be reducing what you've already been provided because she is spending money on dates? Ultimately it's your money but I'm curious how this is working out logistically.", "YTA\n\nIf you give her an allowance, you don't get to dictate what she does with that allowance.\n\nYou're trying to set your daughter up for success by giving her the means to not have to work while in school. That's admirable, but you need to let her be her own person as well.\n\nThe path you're attempting to go down is dangerous. She may realize her freedom is more important than your money, and get her own job which then impacts her schooling.\n\nOr she sticks it out till she's free of you completely, but your relationship is irreparably damaged and she never calls and never visits. You get occasional notifications of her life and new children on Facebook, but you've never met them... how sad for you...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you feel really bad I like the idea of giving her a flat fee for entertainment and she can use as she wants.. might help her with some money management too. It\u2019s easy to save when you aren\u2019t paying for anything but that isn\u2019t really the same as developing the life skill of saving and budgeting", "Heck- it\u2019s not even a rule and she upset! Unbelievable", "I as thinking that too", "We do pay for her to go out alone or with friends. It was never really an issue with other boyfriends that she needed to pay, so new rule in a new context.

This is new territory?  Or you never cared if she (you) paid with other boyfriends?", "NTA for not wanting to pay, but it's kind of weird gatekeeping that you pay for her to go out with friends but don't want to for the boyfriend.  Maybe switch to giving her a set amount for food/entertainment/daily expenses and save everyone a lot of hassle.", "Yeah, YTA then. You *are* trying to control how she spends her time, using money to do it.\n\nYou'd be justified in saying, \"actually, I shouldn't have any input in your recreation, all of that is something you should cover yourself\", and you'd be justified in saying \"this is your budget for recreation\".

A parents mission is to feed their children, dress them and put them into a good school that's it, paying for their dates is not included.", "You are the opposite of controlling.  She can spend her own money on whatever she wants.  NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter is spoiled. She should try college when parents cannot afford tuition haha! I am still paying student loans ten years later. She really does not seem to appreciate how fortunate she is to have so much covered by you. Perfectly reasonable to expect her to pay for dates, and honestly, all other forms of entertainment. She needs a reality check, she is 22, not 12.", "NTA but this should be a general, not specific to her boyfiend. I'd take entertainment out of her budget or give her a set amount of flex money that when she runs out, doesn't get refilled till the next month. Learning to budget is essential to her growth.", "YTA", "Nta, you are being more than reasonable", "Since when is a parent ever expected to pay for dates for the daughter and her boyfriend? So what if you have reservations about the boyfriend. That is totally beside the point. Dates are to be paid for by the people on the date, not the parent of either party. Your daughter needs to have a reality check. She can just go online and ask who should pay for the date. Forbes, Harvard Business Review, Wiki, all say that whoever asks the other out should pay for the date. If the boyfriend asked her out, the boyfriend pays, if she asks him out, she pays. In no case is the parent supposed to pay. If the boyfriend asked her out and is expecting either you or her to pay, he is probably just using her. When the date gets cancelled because you want pay, she will know that he is using her and hopefully will move on to someone else.", "NTA you are providing more, significantly more than you have any obligation to.  She has her own money she can pay for her extras.", "NTA.  She sounds like maybe she should get a taste of real life, and start paying a bill or 2...she certainly  sounds like she has no concept of managing money, even though she was able to save $, she has no clue what people actually have to budget in and pay for in real life.

You're not doing her any favors.", "Info: She specifically asks for money to go on dates? What???", "Parent is to blame for the entitled attitude", "op=nta\n\nbut her level of entitlement is off the charts, it sounds like it's time to start weaning her off the parental teat and expecting her to pay more and more of her own expenses.", "I got used by exes because my dad supported me in undergrad. It made things clear because once the gravy train ended, the guys bailed. Lesson learned.", "Your daughter is immature. Nta", "NTA", "NTA.  You aren't being controlling.  You didn't tell her she can't date her bf.  You just told her she can't date him on your dime.  I would never have asked my parents to pay for my dates, especially not at the age of 22.  I understand that she's trying to save money and that she's on a budget.  Paying for dates falls under the \"entertainment expense\" category.\n\nMy bf wouldn't let me pay for anything (he had more money than he knew what to do with and I was in college w/a part time job).  Once I graduated and had a full-time job, I did manage to convince him that we should at least go dutch on occasion.  It was still a struggle for him, though.", "NTA - you are already paying for everything else for her.  It\u2019s reasonable to draw the line at subsidizing a second person.", "NTA at 22 if she can\u2019t afford going out she shouldn\u2019t be going out. She just needs to get more creative with her date ideas if she doesn\u2019t want to spend money. Cooking at home, going for walks, going to the park. Those are the types of things I did as a broke college student.", "NTA she's 22 acting like 14", "Not necessarily. Good parents can have obnoxious children."]}
