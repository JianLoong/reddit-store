Is it safe to assume that those friends and family come from the same culture as your in-laws?\n\nIn your in-laws' culture, is it a generally accepted practice that wedding gifts are typically cash? And in that culture, do gift-givers generally base the amount of their monetary gift on the presumed/approximate per-person price? And does there generally exist the sentiment that the gift-giver is helping pay for their cost of attendance? Is it generally assumed that the PAYER for the wedding (say, bride's family? Or groom's family?) keeps all, or a portion, of the cash gifts received?\n\nAlternatively, could it be true that in this culture, there is an unspoken \"tallying\" of how much money is gifted between friends and family? For example... \"Hey Honey, how much do you want to gift to the Smith wedding coming up?\" \"Oh, I don't know... Didn't they gift us $200 when or oldest child got married?\" \u201d Yes, I think you're right.\" \"Ok, in that case, let's give them $200.. that way we're even.\" \"Ok, makes sense.\"\n\n\nI'm asking very pointed questions, but I'm inclined to say this is boiling down to a difference in culture that:\na) would lead the parents to viewing you as TA for wanting to keep gifts that were given by their friends and family to help defray the cost of the wedding, and also\nb) would lead to you viewing the parents as TA for wanting to keep the cash that was gifted at your wedding.\n\n\n\nThe way I see it, your in-laws threw a party in honor of your marriage so they could celebrate with their friends and family. I'm guessing those guests likely would not have gifted the money to you had it not been for them being invited to the wedding. Do you know all of the friends and family who were invited? Do you have a relationship with them? If the answer is no, then I would say the guests gave money because of their close relationship with your in-laws... Not because of their close relationship with you.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want the cash. Well, I guess.. let me clarify. I would, of course, love to keep the money.. But I wouldn't feel right for keeping it.. especially if I didn't pay for the wedding myself. And especially if I knew the cultural norm is for the money gifts to go to the payers of the wedding, and especially if the gift-givers prescribe to the same cultural norm.\n\n\nCan you suggest a compromise? Assuming what my pointed questions were trying to get at is all generally correct... Maybe you can suggest that if you/your husband personally have a relationship with the gift giver, then you keep the cash.  However, if you don't have a relationship with the gift giver, then the parents keep the cash. That seems fair to me.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you that your in-laws kept a spreadsheet of gifts received \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd \n\nBest of luck for working this out amicably!", "NTA\n\nLet them be mad.

In my country\u2019s culture, the wedding guests gifts are money, and it\u2019s like a mandatory things to give money each time you\u2019re invited to a wedding. Also, we threw a big party but mainly for the parents\u2019s friends and relatives, and not our friends because both me & my husband left the countries for a long time.\n\nSo, we have a small wedding, which we organised ourselves in the country where we\u2019re living currently, but agreed to our parents that they can  plan the local wedding (which in our minds, are \u201cfor themselves\u201d). All the preparations and expenses are paid by the parents, we just need to show up and smile.\n\nWhen it comes to the money received, for me & my husband, they are all for the parents and not ours. In fact, out of 300 guests who were invited to our wedding, only about 10 were actually our friends. The rest are relatives & parent\u2019s friends. Also, the money given by a guest are seen as \u201cpayback\u201d for the money we gave/ will give when attending their wedding (hence the counting things, so we will give approx the same when it come to their wedding \ud83d\ude02). In our case, we didn\u2019t, and will not attend any of the guests\u2019s wedding (because always live abroad), but our parents did.

The parents gave us back the part that were gifted by our friends, and keep all the rest to help cover the expenses, which again are totally fine for us.\n\nSome of my friends keeps all the money, but that\u2019s because their parents have means and wanted them to keep it for a heads start.", "NTA, but the \"wedding gifts\" of money from their guests are usually used to off set the cost of the wedding.

You receive money when you throw the party, and maybe from close family members even if you don't throw it.\n\nAs it stands, it seems you only got the money because they bothered with the party.\n\nEdit: Not only that, but for you to receive money from their family members it means your in laws also gifted money to those family members when they got married.

Some of these peoples responses are ignorant and downright racist. As a middle eastern I\u2019ve never heard of this. I can\u2019t imagine my parents or any of my aunts and uncles doing this. I had a huge middle eastern wedding and my parents friends and family were super generous. No one asked for a thing. In fact their generosity paid for the entire wedding.

This has to come from him. \n\nYou'll still be blamed, considered disrespectful, a bad influence, etc. That *may* go away over time. Usually improves at the birth of the first grandchild.

No, girl. Then you shouldn't have married an ethnic person. That's just not how it works. You marry the person AND their family--At the very least the immediate fam. And when one side has strong cultural values and things they do, it's all part of what you get\n\nAnd it goes both ways--he has your family now too. As the ethnic person in my relationship, my bf has had to understand what the cultural traditions, behaviors, and expectations are for where my family is from and how to respect them. Those things shaped me.

Is everyone in this story illiterate or is this another cultural difference?", "DANGER! DANGER! DANGER!", "This is what's confusing me. They didn't want a party. I think wedding gifts are somewhat proportional to the wedding. If someone invited people to a courthouse wedding with a BYOB reception with no food, I probably wouldn''t give as much cash/as large a present because weddings can already be quite expensive to attend.

He said everyone used to compete for Middle Eastern passengers because they were the best tippers, but you HAD to approach them for their tip when they were in front of family or friends. If you approached them on their own, you got very little or nothing, in front of family or friends, incredibly generous.\n\nObviously everyone is an individual, but as a general rule he said the important thing was to make sure people could SEE those passengers being generous. That way you made a lot more money!", "The husband grew up in this culture and she did not.

There's cultural expectations and husband has to be the one to say that it's not going to fly.\n\nOne of the posters mentioned how some wedding cultures work by a cycle of cash gift giving.  The parents gave cash to other families and expect cash in return to recoup former expenses.  Husband should have explained the cycle to you.  Now he has to adult up and talk to his parents, because he went along with your plans and he shouldn't be throwing you under the bus.", "This is the sort of thing that sounds like a clever plan, but is more likely to cause irrevocable damage with OP's husband's family and lead to more drama and stress.
