Is it safe to assume that those friends and family come from the same culture as your in-laws?\n\nIn your in-laws' culture, is it a generally accepted practice that wedding gifts are typically cash? And in that culture, do gift-givers generally base the amount of their monetary gift on the presumed/approximate per-person price? And does there generally exist the sentiment that the gift-giver is helping pay for their cost of attendance? Is it generally assumed that the PAYER for the wedding (say, bride's family? Or groom's family?) keeps all, or a portion, of the cash gifts received?\n\nAlternatively, could it be true that in this culture, there is an unspoken \"tallying\" of how much money is gifted between friends and family? For example... \"Hey Honey, how much do you want to gift to the Smith wedding coming up?\" \"Oh, I don't know... Didn't they gift us $200 when or oldest child got married?\" \u201d Yes, I think you're right.\" \"Ok, in that case, let's give them $200.. that way we're even.\" \"Ok, makes sense.\"\n\n\nI'm asking very pointed questions, but I'm inclined to say this is boiling down to a difference in culture that:\na) would lead the parents to viewing you as TA for wanting to keep gifts that were given by their friends and family to help defray the cost of the wedding, and also\nb) would lead to you viewing the parents as TA for wanting to keep the cash that was gifted at your wedding.\n\n\n\nThe way I see it, your in-laws threw a party in honor of your marriage so they could celebrate with their friends and family. I'm guessing those guests likely would not have gifted the money to you had it not been for them being invited to the wedding. Do you know all of the friends and family who were invited? Do you have a relationship with them? If the answer is no, then I would say the guests gave money because of their close relationship with your in-laws... Not because of their close relationship with you.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want the cash. Well, I guess.. let me clarify. I would, of course, love to keep the money.. But I wouldn't feel right for keeping it.. especially if I didn't pay for the wedding myself. And especially if I knew the cultural norm is for the money gifts to go to the payers of the wedding, and especially if the gift-givers prescribe to the same cultural norm.\n\n\nCan you suggest a compromise? Assuming what my pointed questions were trying to get at is all generally correct... Maybe you can suggest that if you/your husband personally have a relationship with the gift giver, then you keep the cash.  However, if you don't have a relationship with the gift giver, then the parents keep the cash. That seems fair to me.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you that your in-laws kept a spreadsheet of gifts received \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd \n\nBest of luck for working this out amicably!", "NTA\n\nLet them be mad.

In my country\u2019s culture, the wedding guests gifts are money, and it\u2019s like a mandatory things to give money each time you\u2019re invited to a wedding. Also, we threw a big party but mainly for the parents\u2019s friends and relatives, and not our friends because both me & my husband left the countries for a long time.\n\nSo, we have a small wedding, which we organised ourselves in the country where we\u2019re living currently, but agreed to our parents that they can  plan the local wedding (which in our minds, are \u201cfor themselves\u201d). All the preparations and expenses are paid by the parents, we just need to show up and smile.\n\nWhen it comes to the money received, for me & my husband, they are all for the parents and not ours. In fact, out of 300 guests who were invited to our wedding, only about 10 were actually our friends. The rest are relatives & parent\u2019s friends. Also, the money given by a guest are seen as \u201cpayback\u201d for the money we gave/ will give when attending their wedding (hence the counting things, so we will give approx the same when it come to their wedding \ud83d\ude02). In our case, we didn\u2019t, and will not attend any of the guests\u2019s wedding (because always live abroad), but our parents did. So in our minds, the money received are parents\u2019s, and not ours.\n\nAt the end, we gave all money for the parents. We didn\u2019t even bother counting them. The parents gave us back the part that were gifted by our friends, and keep all the rest to help cover the expenses, which again are totally fine for us.\n\nSome of my friends keeps all the money, but that\u2019s because their parents have means and wanted them to keep it for a heads start.", "NTA, but the \"wedding gifts\" of money from their guests are usually used to off set the cost of the wedding.

Had my parents paid for my wedding I would have given them the money received (at the very least part of it). \n\nSo I can easily see how your in laws would have assumed when you said you wouldn't give them any money that you meant you were keeping all the cash gifts that guests probably gave intending to help cover the cost of the party.", "This is a tough one.\n\nMy husband and I kept all the wedding money, but that was because we paid for the wedding ourselves.

OP is TA (because while she's not aware of the cultural norms of her husband's family, she appears unwilling to learn and understand it)\n\nThere's a reason why in-laws wrote down what was received- so they're aware of what may be due back.\n\nSpeaking from the perspective of someone who is a part of a culture similar to middle-eastern, there is a bank of money that is forever circulating amongst family and friends. This covers weddings, births, new home etc. When you accept money, there's an assumption that you've agreed to be a part of this system. If you plan not to reciprocate money given, cash gifts should be returned back to your parents/inlaws, since it is their input into the system that got you this money.\n\nWedding related parties are expensive as anything, and any cash gifts don't cover the cost of the party, however they do offset the amount. In this culture if parents/in-laws do not hold a wedding, despite enjoying and participating in weddings held by family and friends, it may appear cheap. You do not want to appear cheap.\n\nTo cut a long story short. OP and husband opted out of engaging in the system, being that they had an intimate ceremony which didn't require any financial outlay to in-laws family and friends.\n\nOP and husband(who surprisingly knows nothing of this cultural practise)should return ALL the money to in-laws, seeing its money they received not only because of their relationship with in-laws, but because of a history of cash-giving in-laws have participated in within their culture.\n\n*It's wild how insensitive some people on here are of cultures they don't belong to.", "> It\u2019s common courtesy to decline the first few times before you accept a gift in most settings in middle eastern culture\n\nthis is exactly it, as an Arab person", "interesting point.

So in fact offering half of the money (where you keep half of what you did not even invest) or even all of it still seems like a pretty good deal - you got a nice party to attend in our name at least. I mean hey! For zero spending from your own pocket? Sounds like a good deal. If you did not want a free party at all, say no and call it a day. I am assuming the parents wanted the party for their friends and family - to give them the chance to celebrate you and also \"re-pay\" them for the wedding parties they attended or will attend in the future. It is pretty similar in Eastern European culture. Which is why for our wedding we decided to bear more than 60% of the wedding costs ourselves.  But since both our parents wanted to contribute we agreed they would pay what they felt comfortable with and we covered the rest. We did not have to agree, they would have said to keep the money anyway, but we did decide to clarify with them before-hand if they wanted \"their paid share\" back. They didn't - and we kept it. Which btw was less than 50% of what we invested in the wedding, and no - we did not make a lavish wedding, it was pretty low-cost in fact. The guests were just not feeling very generous I guess. Which was fine. We knew we were investing in memories, and not to have a return-back on investment situation.   \n\n\nIn this case you did want any, yet you still got \"some\". Just as a simple act of gratitude I would have offered the half they expected, even all of it. Seems fair since you got a free party out of it and some (hopefully) nice memories.

I have half the money to my in laws without asking if they wanted it or then suggesting (they paid for everything) it was money I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise and my way of saying thank you. Really you should, and you shouldn\u2019t ask if they want it- you just give it", "YTA. You agreed you wouldn't give them money FOR THE PARTY. That doesn't mean you can't be thankful and pay them back some of it from the gifts, which apparently are supposed to pay back for some of the party cost anyway? You wouldn't have had ANY MONEY if they hadn't thrown you a party.\n\nClearly the husband knows more than OP and he's the biggest AH for not explaining how it works.", "It\u2019s your wedding gift so you decide what happens with your property. My advice after having been married into a very traditional Chinese family for a few years now is don\u2019t allow toxic behavior for the sake of tradition or culture. Took me years to get my wife to be willing to tell her mother no about literally anything but my boundaries are my boundaries.", "NTA\n\nThe deal was agreed and they are now wanting to change terms.", "I mean, would also work for Irish in-laws. My family will say they don\u2019t want a coffee, and then be passive-aggressively mad at you for a year because they didn\u2019t get any coffee. (I asked three times! That is the agreed on number of times to ask in society.)", "This is true. Always let your husband handle his parents. Meaning, give all the money to your husband and tell him to handle it. Be prepared to lose all the money. That\u2019s how it will be till death do you part. Kids will tie you to that too. Good luck.", "This would not go the way you think. They'll all pity the parents for having a daughter-in-law from hell. As an Arab person, I cringed through the whole post and every clearly Westerner comment here. \n\nThis post is pretty divided between ME people thinking YTA and Westerners thinking NTA.", "You elaborated so well. \n\nIn my view, OP - your intention of finding out who TA is in this situation is probably not the most urgent thing. Ideally we should refrain from passing a judgement and just moving on when it comes to family but rather discuss amicably and sort out stuff. \n\nIf the gifts would have never been given unless there was a ceremony then I personally would have given the in laws a share to cover their wedding costs. But again this isn\u2019t mandatory and ideally should have been discussed before the event. Probably if you could have just given everything to them they would have returned it saying you guys are young, keep it. But instead taking the cash gifts at an expensive event organised by the in-laws says you only care about your savings and not your family\u2019s.", "Yup, exactly THIS. In my culture you \u201ehelp\u201c pay for the wedding through your cash gift as a wedding guest. I\u2018d ask for my money back if I was a guest at this wedding and found out the bride and groom paid for NOTHING whilst keeping my money intended to help pay off the wedding.", "Then western person should've split half the cost bc that's western tradition. But she didnt,she followed his tradition for a party with his family and friends giving gifts, where it's tradition to give the money to the poor Indian family.", ">They're playing power games with you.\n\nthey're literally acting completely normal within the logic of their culture, which is a msitake solely because the unspoken rules weren't explained to OP *before* the awkward situation", "Lol your advice is probably the worst I've read in this post. She's married into a Indian family, they are tighter than your self hating white family your use to.", "So if you know the culture you understand that they throw parties just because, which they always do. This party was meant as a gift for us, perfect, they decided to name it a wedding party so we could receive gifts, which was okay. \n\nThey could've perfectly throw a party with the same guests and no one would've taken a gift, but they did because it was meant for the bride and groom. \n\nDoesn't matter the customs, if you say something regardless of the traditions, they shouldn't act as victims when we do what they ask for. \n\nI've never seen that someone needs to pay after a baby shower thrown by in-laws, so what's the difference in here?", "Sounds like you married into a dumpster fire.\n\nGood luck.", "100%. OP only received the Not Ahole judgement due to their shoddy initial description of the scenario. Reading their additional comments firmly plants OP in A-hole territory.", "Sounds like a you problem.", "This isn't it at all. You're applying Western logic to a ME cultural issue. It's considered common courtesy to decline having your expenses paid by someone else a few times. We do this all the time and over the smallest thing. If you don't, you risk appearing shameless, greedy, taking advantage of people's good will.\n\nIf someone else does pay the bill you're supposed to pay it forward in the future by also offering to pay and not taking no for an answer.\n\nIt's not some 4D chess, it's a tradition of I-owe-yous.", "it\u2019s not like presenting the owner of a restaurant a tip. the restaurant owners recovers the cost within the price of the meal. i go to events for friends and i try to provide a present that covers the cost of my attendance plus a little extra. because if the event is to celebrate someone else\u2019s good fortune i don\u2019t want the invitee to pay for me to celebrate with them. i don\u2019t want them to pay for my attendance. instead i want to gift them. so i try to make my gift just a little more costly than what i think my attendance costs the host.\n\ni do find it odd that your parents in law are ultimately expecting you to help cover the cost of the wedding. they\u2019re not willing for the full cost of the wedding to be a gift to you. but at the end of the day you didn\u2019t earn that money. if they want some of it back just give it to them.", "You're literally desperate to be the victim here.\n\nYou complain about them getting some guest money because you \"didn't have any say in the planning\", you didn't want to have a say and taking on the labour of making all the decisions also is a gift. Then you also claim you didn't want this, in which case why would making decisions matter?\n\nThen you complain they didn't pay for your elopement party - very much doubt the customary amount would exceed 50% of the guest gifts, so you are still getting more than you would have anyway. Plus, they paid 15k for the party on top of giving their time which is well past their \"fair share\" to attend the elopement party.\n\nThen you complain about the rest of the family, in contexts that are irrelevant. Obviously they give money to their college age daughter. Who wouldn't. The other son is ill advised but they don't want him to die. And you don't \"know\" that they wouldn't do the same to those kids, because from the sounds of it, they aren't married.\n\nYou're literally getting free money for putting zero work in, stop being so tight", "'...your last three sentences have me thinking you're insensitive to their culture and probably many others.'\n\nUm ok. You got all that from my comment which gives history behind cash gifts in my culture which appears to be somewhat similar to Middle Eastern culture?\n\n'My generation is being forced to have these ceremonies and our parents pay...'\n\nThis mysterious force enacted on your generation...could it be called...culture?\n\nI'm not speaking to what people are forced into doing by their families in the name of culture. OP and husband opted out of paying for hundreds of guests. That is their right to do. So why would/should they benefit from a system they're not a part of?", "Stupid camel trader custom though, we're ending it.", "It's not of who's a victim in here. \n\nIt's that they could've throw a party \"just because\" with the same guests and no one would've brought a gift, the difference here is that everyone brought a gift to the groom and bride, not to whoever did the wedding. Everyone is loosing the point. \n\nWho said the other son is not married? \n\nJust because the family situation is not expressed in this post, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I talked facts about both of them, because guess what? When my husband was in college they didn't give him money, but both of the other children they got money. My husband had to buy his own house, but his parents gave the oldest son land so he could build his house (which he never did) and I can go on with the bunch of situations here.", "Thank you. Couldn\u2019t have said it better. OP clearly doesn\u2019t want to listen even after it\u2019s explained by so many of them.", "I\u2019m Greek, some shit is truly universal.  Our wedding was truly a Big Fat Greek wedding that I had to be dragged into.  My mom and sister planned the whole thing but the cash gifts paid for our first condo cash.", "OP didn't want to have this party, so why shouldn't she get the benefit? As stated,  it is not in our tradition to give money for the wedding back to the person why pays, so, again, your comments do not apply to this culture. Come again..", "They're gonna half a fun life together. Selfish wife and traditional helping husband.", "You seem to keep not acknowledging that you would not have ANY of that money had they not pushed and paid for a wedding party for you both. A decent person would show gratitude where you are showing entitlement. You're right, the issue is not the money, the issue is your discourteous and entitled response to a kind and generous gesture. You're trying to profit off their kindness while simultaneously bashing them, their culture, and can't even offer a small pittance to recognize their efforts and costs incurred. \n\nIt's clear you're only searching for an echo chamber to back you up, but you're still the (bigger) AH in this scenario.", ">This wedding party was a gift from them, since when should we pay for gifts?\n\nYOU are not paying for anything. The guests did. Not YOU. The wedding was the gift, the money the guests paid should go in part to recoup the wedding. \n\nYou don't even sound like you'll be paying that money back into those peoples' future weddings. You're taking money out of an ecosystem with no intention to give back.\n\n>Beside the guests gave gifts to the bride and groom not to whoever paid the party\n\nGo ahead and tell them ME guests this story then. Make yourself seem like the rude daughter-in-law from hell to everyone. The example they tell their sons not to marry into. Nuke every bridge.\n\n>their kids are married and they never requested money from them\n\nAccording to you, one is constantly broke and the other is a girl (hence that cost is her husband and in-laws' responsibility). And you're terribly resentful that they don't ask the son with little money for money. Like it should be the other way around somehow... \n\n>their mindset should change and if not, this is our family and we set up boundaries\n\nGirl, your \"boundaries\" are \"fuck your shitty culture THIS IS AMERIKKKA\". It's incredibly racist and I have to wonder if your husband knows you think so little of his culture.\n\n>If you don't set them up at the beginning every party they will expect money back.\n\nThat is NOT how these traditions work and you're saying this in bad faith. You think you're setting boundaries when in reality you're antagonising your in-laws for no reason.", "The parents are getting the benefit of saving face and not looking poor. Guess what, it's going to cost them. The other alternative was nothing, which was the baseline expectation from the couple.", "It\u2019s a culture which highly prioritizes family. No one is saying you need to give all your money to his siblings. But there is a cultural expectation to support your family (not only financially). But if you continue to ignore everyone\u2019s comments indicating the cultural norms and instead choose to ignore them entirely you will struggle with your relationship with the family.\n\nYou\u2019re not an ass for not understanding the culture around accepting money. You are one for  how you are representing yourself in this post and to his family."]}
