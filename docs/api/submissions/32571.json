Is it safe to assume that those friends and family come from the same culture as your in-laws?\n\nIn your in-laws' culture, is it a generally accepted practice that wedding gifts are typically cash? And in that culture, do gift-givers generally base the amount of their monetary gift on the presumed/approximate per-person price? And does there generally exist the sentiment that the gift-giver is helping pay for their cost of attendance? Is it generally assumed that the PAYER for the wedding (say, bride's family? Or groom's family?) keeps all, or a portion, of the cash gifts received?\n\nAlternatively, could it be true that in this culture, there is an unspoken \"tallying\" of how much money is gifted between friends and family? For example... \"Hey Honey, how much do you want to gift to the Smith wedding coming up?\" \"Oh, I don't know... Didn't they gift us $200 when or oldest child got married?\" \u201d Yes, I think you're right.\" \"Ok, in that case, let's give them $200.. that way we're even.\" \"Ok, makes sense.\"\n\n\nI'm asking very pointed questions, but I'm inclined to say this is boiling down to a difference in culture that:\na) would lead the parents to viewing you as TA for wanting to keep gifts that were given by their friends and family to help defray the cost of the wedding, and also\nb) would lead to you viewing the parents as TA for wanting to keep the cash that was gifted at your wedding.\n\n\n\nThe way I see it, your in-laws threw a party in honor of your marriage so they could celebrate with their friends and family. I'm guessing those guests likely would not have gifted the money to you had it not been for them being invited to the wedding. Do you know all of the friends and family who were invited? Do you have a relationship with them? If the answer is no, then I would say the guests gave money because of their close relationship with your in-laws... Not because of their close relationship with you.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want the cash. Well, I guess.. let me clarify. I would, of course, love to keep the money.. But I wouldn't feel right for keeping it.. especially if I didn't pay for the wedding myself. And especially if I knew the cultural norm is for the money gifts to go to the payers of the wedding, and especially if the gift-givers prescribe to the same cultural norm.\n\n\nCan you suggest a compromise? Assuming what my pointed questions were trying to get at is all generally correct... Maybe you can suggest that if you/your husband personally have a relationship with the gift giver, then you keep the cash.  However, if you don't have a relationship with the gift giver, then the parents keep the cash. That seems fair to me.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you that your in-laws kept a spreadsheet of gifts received \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd \n\nBest of luck for working this out amicably!", "NTA\n\nLet them be mad.

I prefer to move-out of state than leaving my marriage cause of in-laws. My mindset is I married my husband not his family, my family is the one we started when we got marry. If they want to be part of this family, they better respect those boundaries. I'm hispanic and my boundaries with family are extremely strict, specially cause my mom had the exact problem and she thought me good without quitting marriage.", "She is blind to the reality of her life at this point I'm afraid.", "I would agree to give them money if I would've been involved in the wedding decisions, or if we would've agreed to it in first place. But they said no money is needed from gifts or from us. Besides, that was a gift from them. \n\nWe hosted a super expensive wedding dinner with our families and we are not requesting them to pay for it. Why should we do theirs?", "Be right, as this will be the third time making us feel guilty and offering them an apology for something we didn't do and doesn't make sense.", "From what some of the people say, there won't be peace.  The parents will just come up with new demands.", "Thank you for the correction!", "URI will also make you woozy and kind of disoriented if I remember correctly!!!!!!!!!! Hope you feel better soon!!!!", "Are they Persian, by any chance? There's a cultural tradition of ALWAYS refusing money even though you expect it to be paid. I'm not joking when I say always. A cab driver in Tehran will straight up refuse payment from you but run after you if you get out of the car without paying. It's a back-and-forth (honestly as common as asking someone how they are. The expected response is \"fine, how are you?\" as opposed to it being a real request for info)", "So is it customary to reimburse the parents for the costs? It's unclear why they expect reimbursement.", "Middle Eastern? They'll expect dil to take care of them", "Don\u2019t ever let them move in with you, or \u201cbuy you a house\u201d, or you will never know peace.", "If I were you, I'd tell your husband right now that if these people are ever in your house for longer than 48 hours, he'll have divorce papers by close of business the following business day.\n\nLife's too short to entertain bullshit like this in yours.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t offer since we used it for X. We appreciate that you agreed this in advance.\u201d", "Then you did marry your husband's family, after all. \n\nIf he's too sweet to refuse their demands, expect him to be their proxy every time something ridiculous like this comes up.", "You have a husband problem, not an in-law problem.\n\nYou probably want to bookmark /r/justnomil for later.", "Then he\u2019s not with you.  He\u2019s with whoever pushes more.\n\nHe needs to take point of this and tell them to stop", "Ahhh this is a husband problem not in in-laws issue then! \n\nNTA but your husband sucks for not stepping up and telling his gaslighting parents to go to hell. \n\nYour in for a LONG HARD life unless you put a stop to these shenanigans right now.", "This is incredibly naive, you married into a middle-eastern family - it will never just you and your husband.", "No, not Persian, but they did joke because they even said it with straight face this is y'all gift.", "Not at all.", "Not just take care** wait on them hand and foot. Always make sure the nuts are fresh & the tea is hot. There is a hot fresh meal & the bread is warm.", "She is in the honeymoon phase and can't wrap her head around what a colossal mess she is in with this man. Why on earth should he be apologizing? That would be a huge mistake! If he does, the parents will have a death grip on their life together forever!", "It's not a husband problem at all, as he's with me on the decision on not letting them guilt us for this situation. But he prefers to have peace with them, which will lead to apologize to them when he's not in fault.", "Well then, they're bonkers. NTA somehow I think you're happily married to a man who's parents you will never be able to please or satisfy.", "NTA\n\nTell your ILs that if you did so that you would have to send amended thank you notes...to everyone. \n\n\"Thanks so much for your generous gift of $100!  Newlyweds will be using $50 towards a honeymoon. The other $50 will go to ILs because they say they are poor and need the money more than us.  Again we ALL thank you.\"", "If he's willing to sacrifice your peace for their games then you do in fact have a husband problem, he will choose his parents over you every single time unless you draw a hard line in the sand and quickly.", "Nope. He can\u2019t have it both ways. Either he is on your side and setting boundaries with his parents, or he is not actually on your side at all. Everyone has to learn to set boundaries with their family as they grow, if they want to have healthy relationships with their family and their partner. \n\nThis. Is. A. Husband. Problem. \n\nHis family. His job to handle it and take the brunt of the pushback over it.", "He's not choosing at all his parents, otherwise they would've had the money right after he knew they were mad because of that and he would've accepted their calls, food, etc to fall into their games. But he has asked me every single time how to proceed. He has shown what a real husband is.", "Obviously you know him better than us, all I have to go off is what you've said and honestly it sounds exhausting. \nHe has to ask you every time ? He doesn't know how to stand up for his family without you always holding his hand and telling him what to do ?\n\nMaybe I just have zero tolerance for this kind of nonsense but he shouldn't need your guidance every step of the way", "Yes, we discussed everything before taking decisions that will affect others, specially when these type of situations emerge, as he doesn't want me to be seen as the bad one. We are always extremely careful on how we say things to our families."]}
