My husband said he didn't want anything from Culver's but agreed to go for me. He comes back about 20 minutes later with two drinks, one looks like a milkshake and one looks like a thicker, lumpier milkshake. He said \"Here's your oreo malt you wanted.\" I am taken aback and say \"Baby I didn't want that type of drink and I was really looking forward to my concrete mixer\" He said \"Yes you told me you wanted a malt.\" \n\nMind you, I've never even tasted a malt before this one he got me. I figured I might like it, so I gave it a sip. I tried it and I honestly was disgusted by the thick grainy-lumpy texture, but tried to ignore it while he sat on the couch and drank his oreo shake. I finally couldn't take it anymore and I started to cry and say that I really didn't like the malt and it's not at all what I ordered or wanted. He told me I was overreacting and \"Every other human being in the world would shut up and say thank you and drink the drink, but you're really something else entirely\". I said I didn't think I was overreacting, and I asked if he still had the receipt to be able to go back to the restaurant and explain that he'd ordered the wrong thing. He left to get me the concrete mixer anyway, but said I was being crazy and unreasonable. \n\nHe told me that when he initially got to the restaurant he forgot what I wanted but knew it wasn't a milkshake so he ordered whatever else was there.  Am I the asshole for asking him to return the malt?\n\nEDIT for some questions I keep seeing:\n1.) He had his phone, his reasoning for not double checking with me is that he didn't want to hold up the drive through or make the clerk wait.\n\n2.) He did end up getting me the mixer but had a whole dialogue about how he hoped he got me the \"correct oreo ice cream dessert this time\"\n\n3.) I have a texture issue when eating, so I prefer ice cream with toppings mixed in (a concrete) over a milkshake\n\n4.) I am not saying the sofas are not a shared responsibility- I am saying when he asked me to help he said he'd get me dessert.

All he had to do was say \u201csorry babe, I\u2019ll go back and get the thing you asked for.\u201d\n\nHe probably does this all the time, in a multitude of different little ways, and this was finally the breaking point. It\u2019s just a million little ways that he tells you he doesn\u2019t respect you. Let me guess, it\u2019s always your fault, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s never his.

Your husband really doesn't give a shit, and this malt was the physical manifestation of how little he cares about you.

Another commenter mentioned he could have offered you his drink since he got the order wrong, this would have been a much better solution than just telling you to suck it up and be grateful.\n\nAt this point it isn't about the icecream. It's about the disrespect.  I would never treat my partner like this if I cared about their feelings. I'm guessing this is just one instance, stacked with many other varying degrees and situations where he's disregarded your feelings or minimized you. It's a culmination.\n\nYes, crying was a perfectly reasonable response to this situation. There is nothing inherently evil about crying. It is something that happens outside of our control, especially when we are overwhelmed.\n\nThere is a deeper issue here that needs to be addressed. Do you have close friends or family outside of your relationship that you can talk to without judgment? Or maybe a therapist, or couples counselor if that's more appropriate for you.\n\nI'm sorry for what you are going through. You are not crazy. This was rude as hell and your reactions were warrented.

Hell, I cried one day because I couldn't find the shirt I wanted to wear.\n\nHe would've likely had a similar reaction if you promised him his favorite food and came home with something completely different.

It is hurtful that over the course of the years from when you were first together to now married with a child, it went from him having you on a pedestal and doing anything to be with you, to make you happy, and now he doesn\u2019t even give a rat\u2019s behind that now you can\u2019t have ice cream and he can and it\u2019s his fault for spacing and not caring to call!

I bet if he was mistakenly given something that wasn\u2019t what he ordered for himself and he didn\u2019t like it, he\u2019d have gone back. \nWhat sucks, too, is that he\u2019d probably have offered and apology and quickly gone back if it were like, a friend or neighbor or co-worker, because he probably is Mr. Charming Nice Guy to everyone else but you, his actions are showing that in his view, you apparently only deserve him being a selfish, irritated jerk who just wants you to shut up and stifle your emotions. It\u2019s a miserable existence and if you do just shut up and keep your emotions to your self and never or seldom ever tell him something he did or said isn\u2019t right in order to not get gaslit, guilted, or reprimanded by him, eventually you\u2019ll end up dead inside.", " NTA", "My favorite part is where you started crying but then said you didn\u2019t think you were overreacting\u2026.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband acted like a jerk, and so insulting.", "ESH\n\nI mean...who TF thinks it's acceptable to return ICE CREAM?!", "NTA - Every phone has a notes app, no excuse other than apathy.", "Crying over this\u2026.

Are you like normal and ok in this relationship is the dialogue normal for you??", "Did I miss the reason why you didn't go with him to culvers?", "Your husband is an inconsiderate asshole, that\u2019s really it", "Both of y\u2019all need to grow up", "YTA. Malts are a wonderful taste and texture delight. Whopper candies come close, but the ice cream drink is pure heaven.", "ESH. Some people are so in the moment they forget some details, especially after moving two sofas a couple blocks away. He was kind of tired and probably didn't want to go, but still did for you. Yes he should have called/texted you, but if he didn't want to go in the first place, he probably wanted to be in and out there as fast as possible, he took a chance hoping you'll like it, but failed. You should have sent a text, say babee don't forget it's \"blank\" kind I'm craving/want. Communications is key. He's already doing the majority of work getting you what you want, at least help the poor fella out with a text, so he will remember for sure with other occasions in the future. But one thing is for certain he ain't gonna forget what type of Oreo milkshake you only drink. I've learned that if I'm going to get things I let them know text me what you want, cause anything can happen in the moment that will distract anybody's memory.", "Thank you so much for linking the book- I was reccomended it long ago but never got around to reading it. Thank you for your take as well, I appreciate the clarity", "Has it occurred to you he might have misheard OP or misremembered what she said? Why is the first thing that came to your mind abuse tactics", "This is super bad advice, it's childish to whine over a milkshake , yeah he could have given his but it doesn't matter it's a milkshake. Maybe he has things that he thinks are more important on his mind. \n\nMaybe they are different types and don't belong together, I'm sure plenty of individuals would care about small things in life, but maybe he is a person that doesn't want to, doesn't mean he is the asshole or gasligther", "Funnily enough he repeated my order back to me before he left and still got the wrong thing", "This is why even if my partner tells me what he wants if I'm stopping off somewhere, I tell him to text it to me so I can verify it when I'm ordering that I'm getting the right thing.", ">He can\u2019t return the malt as it\u2019s a food item\n\nIt's up to the store/restaurant whether they would allow a return.  They would have to toss it in the trash because it's a food item, but many places will take returns and refund your money or credit you for a replacement drink/dessert/whatever.", "Thank you, this was super validating", "OP... This. All of this. My husband has gotten me the wrong thing before and I cried. It wasn't that I hated him, it was just that I was looking forward to something specific and I got overly emotional. My husband still apologized and offered to get me something else.\n\nI can't drink certain coffee without getting physically sick, and one day he ordered the wrong thing... his first response has never been \"be grateful you overreacting baby\" it was \"oh my God babe I'm so sorry, here try mine, you might like it better.\" We joke about each mix up to this day and I always apologize for my emotions, hell tell me that I have nothing to apologize for and it's ok\n\n\nYour husband needs to get over himself.

Do you flop on the ground and have a sook aswell? \n\nChrist you're dramatic.", "What a ludicrous diva drama queen overreaction.", "Yes he does, yes he did, and he said he didn't want to call me because he didn't want to make the drive through worker wait", "Yes he does things and doesn't really think about how it affects me until after the fact.", "Thank you- Yes I have a therapist.", "Not when your partner gaslights you, emotionally manipulates you and disregards your feelings in a matter. This sounds like the last straw in a series of relationship neglect on his part. Although sometimes we also can't control our emotions when things are stressful so calling her dramatic for having emotions is shotty itself.", "Finally, someone talking about the crying over ice cream. I have small children who don't cry over ice cream. Either op is dealing with some deeper issues or... I can't think of anything else to make me cry over ice cream. I can think of lots of reasons to cry but this just isn't one of them.", "I had an issue with that opening sentence too. That she \u2018helped\u2019 move the house furniture - that did not sit well with me. Then her husband got them drinks, messed up the order and she cried over it and sent him back to the shop to say he ordered wrongly. What was she expecting the shop to do anyway? Give them a new drink?

He knew he didn\u2019t but what she wanted.  He knew he had forgotten.  But rather than own that, he doubled down and told her this is what she ordered.", "It's not (only) the shake, it is mostly the lack of understanding and lack of care of her partner...I would be very sad too and also there is nothing childish about crying for this. It happens on bad days to cry for little things, sometimes I cry when I get my shirt sleve stuck on the door handle, in general when is the cherry on top of a bad day", "The people who get mad about others crying are often the same people who think anger isn\u2019t an emotion", "If you feel unheard and insignificant to the point of tears, because someone accidentally got you the wrong drink is just dramatic.\n\nHe was trying to do something nice for her", "This is \u2026.a lot.  And I think you somehow managed to nail every bit of it.  This is how it feels.", "It may not be a first-time thing. And if the day was really stressful, it might just be the last thing that knocked them over the edge.\n\nI've cried over a pencil dropping on a day that just couldn't seem to give me a break for 5 seconds. It's pent up stress.", "I'd say crying over a literal milkshake is the giant red flag here!", "Sure, but crying because someone accidentally got you the wrong drink type is entitled and childish.", "Honestly, yes to all of this.", "You forgot something between 2 and 3.\n\nHe gaslighted her into thinking she ordered the wrong thing and then disregarded her emotions about the wrong drink. - being upset about getting the wrong order is a valid thing. And then crying about this treatment from her husband made her cry... not the fact that it is simply a wrong order.", "It\u2019s not about the shake. It about how little he cares about her. How long does it take to call and say \u201cI forgot what was it you wanted. Easy but he did not care. I bet he does this stuff all the time.", "Kinda sorry for your 6-year old for having such an emotionally non-reflective and not really empathetic parent who does not understand the results of gaslighting and getting their emotions disregarded.", "How?", "Yes - I'm a FTM and was super stressed out today. My husband promised me dessert after helping him. I cried because I felt like he wasn't really listening to me.", "Because he knew he was wrong and still told her she made the mistake. That is gaslighting and abusive behaviour.\n\nEDIT: If he misheard her and would actually be sorry about it he would have apologized and told her that he misheard/forgot in the beginning (even tho, there is still the question why he didn't text her), instead of making her doubt her own actions and accountability.", "It's Reddit and relationship advice. \n\nNo couple can have an issue without abuse being involved.", "Found OP's boyfriend. YTA", "Okay, so apparently he's like my brother.  I can tell him what I want, he'll repeat, but he still forgets.

NTA", "It's not about the vanilla oreo concrete mixer....", "How do you get over emotional over a drink are you 5 years old ?", "Most of us are not married to the cashier so they never made vows to care about our feelings.", "Totally different context", "Yes, because God forbid he realize that he forgot what you wanted, and go park the car and call or text you and go inside to get it \u2026\n\nHe wasn\u2019t willing to inconvenience himself for his memory lapse.", "Something I do with my forgetful fella to avoid situations such as this is text him my order, whether I have verbalized it or not. That way if it slips his mind be can quickly pull it up. Cheers!", "I see. Thank you.", "This situation is deeper than. It\u2019s not just about the ice cream. In my opinion You guys need to sit down and have a calm conversation about whatever you need to talk about. Slowly building resentments sucks, that\u2019s why communication is key. I hope he is willing to listen and I wish you the best.", "Woah relax the only info she gave was about the wrong order - you added all these assumptions based on nothing", "Ofc she would cry if this is the last straw. Duuuuh. Most of you have never been in a terrible/abusive relationship and it shows", "I mean we all scream for ice cream but never cry", "Yeah and he's a dick for that. As I said.", ">He was trying to do something nice for her\n\nAre you sure? Because he gaslighted her and disregarded her emotions.\n\nJust because someones does 'something nice' for you does not mean you have to appreciate it, especially if the 'nice' thing shows that he just did not care about her wishes and, instead of telling her he made a mistake, shows her how he rather lies to her about her own actions instead of telling her the truth.", "I cried over an email yesterday. Everyone gets overwhelmed by stress sometimes. It's what we do next that matters. I don't think OP handled it well, but her husband threw gas on the fire with the way he spoke to her.", "people don\u2019t just go from 0 to 100 in a second, she started crying bc this is a reoccurring thing with him.", "I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this comment...  and comments that he's gaslighting ???? I think more realistically, he only remembered she said oreo something and ordered the first item he saw that had oreo in it...\n\nEta, omg, these morons have reproduced.", "Then let's ask OP if her husband has a phone to begin with.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, the guy had a phone, but didn't call since he was apparently in a drive-through. \n\nIn this case, I think that he could have parked in the parking lot to call or text.", "It is the point that he didn\u2019t care enough to get what she wanted. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not about the shake. He could have called you but again he doesn\u2019t care. Does he ignore you often?", "Yeah this is over the top. You being a FTM doesn't matter. esh . You guys are perfect", "I\u2019m on your side for the rest of this but concerned that you think being trans has anything to do with it? Cis and trans people both have emotions and emotional reactions.", "I doubt he knew he was wrong, what does he get out of lying about the order? He didn\u2019t apologise because he clearly thought his order was right, then she started crying over a drink.\n\nEither way, accusing someone of an abuse tactic is serious", "I guarantee if it was a man crying because his wife got the wrong drink after he \u201chelped her carry the sofas\u201d, people would called it abusive", "My SO always say \"text me what you want\" to not risk to misremember.

I'm guessing you've never gotten emotional over something.\n\nEditing to add- It wasn't the drink she was crying over. It was his blatant repetitive disregard for her and her feelings/wants/needs and his reaction to her.", "Yeah, most of us also marry a person that we think are atleast emotionally stable and not cry over the smallest of things. \n\nI mean, I dont like ricotta in my tomato pasta when its my wife's turn to cook. But it's her favourite, I dont throw a fit over it when she tells me that's whats on the menu for dinner that night.", "This makes a lot of sense, especially why you genuinely were in tears - it sounds like it's not just the malt.", "Actually she's made a comment about what I've said, claiming this isn't the first disregard and disrespect he's shown", "Gaslighting is now everybody\u2019s favorite word on", "Getting an order wrong and saying someone ordered something different, because you though they did, isn\u2019t gaslighting.\n\n\nIf someone does something nice for you and you aren\u2019t appreciative, especially if it\u2019s something you asked for them to do, you are the AH", "We don't know that, which makes it tricky.\n\nIf this is reocurring behaviour with him, totally valid reaction.

If there is an actual deeper reason for her crying, then her emotional response is valid. But if there isn't and she just wanted ice cream then she's in fact being childish (but not controlling, \"like a dog\" chill, he's not her slave, damn). But OP is being very vague in her responses to know which is it.\n\nShe's making is seem as if there's a deeper issue, but not really giving an actual response of weight to anything.\n\nIt's tricky because the info we have, even the extra one in the comments, is vague enough to make it so."]}
