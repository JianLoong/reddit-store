You can see the future for your boy when it comes to graduations, weddings etc, and the rows about whether his steps attend/participate, and it\u2019s all likely avoidable if they just back off and let the kids develop a relationship of their own.

This is your time with your son and he is plenty old enough to make his own decisions, but it's understandable that your ex would want her son at an important family event.
