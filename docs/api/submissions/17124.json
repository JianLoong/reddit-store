I said it's my parenting time and I am bringing him to the party he wants to attend. She ended the call with me and then called our son who told her he wanted to go to his friend's party. She called me back up then and told me what she'd done. She said I could still bring him to his stepsister's party and let the other parents know he won't be attending. I told her I would not do that to him and he's old enough to decide which party to attend.\n\nShe called me an asshole and said I should be helping him prioritize a family party over a friend party, especially when it's a party for a younger sibling.

Sounds like stepsister is you ex's family, not your son's. She can get over it", "NTA, and at 12, your son is certainly old enough to decide which party he wants to attend. Your ex will just have to build a bridge and get over it.", "NTA. Even if he wanted to go to the other party he\u2019d already committed to the friend.", "Nta it's your time and you don't have to do anything she asks.", "NTA. Mind boggling behavior from your ex.", "NTA Your son is old enough to decide for himself which party to attend. Just because they're step siblings doesn't make them actual siblings and want to be around each other.", "NTA - 1. he is 12, which is more than old enough to choose his own preferences, 2. this is YOUR weekend and she doesn't get to dictate what you do on it, 3. he didn't want to go to his step-siblings bday either way (he doesn't like them that much).\n\nDoes she really think strong-arming him into forgoing his actual FRIENDS bday will somehow magically cement a sibling relationship when they don't like each other currently? If so, she's delusional. Want to make him hate those kids even more? THIS is how you do it. Force him to give up what he wants in order to appease his mother and the step's, and watch how fast he disengages from them altogether.\n\nIf she keeps disrespecting his wants, you may end up back in family court with him telling the judge he wants to stay by you full time.", "NTA, that's not his sibling and he doesn't want to go.

His step siblings, which OP calls his ex steps, are younger than him.  this leads me to believe step sibs mom isn't 12 year old's mother.  Unless he was with mom, they split up, she got with someone else and then OP and mom got back together later.", "He gets every other week (we do one week with his mom and one week with me) and sometimes there's like two weeks with one and two with the other for summer. But yes, there are other times they are together.", "They have already pushed it to where I expect that will be the relationship they have at best. My son has grown used to the pushing but doesn't like it and it hasn't warmed him up to his stepsiblings at all, much to the annoyance of my ex.", "Exactly!  When you assume, you make an @$$ out of u and me.\n\nNTA OP.", "For me it's about my son and the fact he wants to go to one over the other. I think she would be upset but I'm not sure. I don't really know his stepsister or his stepbrother.", "Yes, they don't share any biological parents. They are my ex-wife's stepchildren from a prior relationship of her husband. Ex and I share custody of our son and my ex's husband has full custody of his two children.", "It\u2019s something that you see on here so often, and it\u2019s really sad - kids being shoehorned into a pretence at happy families ending up estranged as adults, when giving them space and respecting their feelings might let a loving or at least friendly relationship develop naturally.   You can see the future for your boy when it comes to graduations, weddings etc, and the rows about whether his steps attend/participate, and it\u2019s all likely avoidable if they just back off and let the kids develop a relationship of their own. He might eventually find he likes them for themselves if they weren\u2019t being pushed on him so much.", "The only ways they're siblings would be if your ex formally adopted them (and even then it'd be tenuous), or if they liked each other to actually consider themselves family.  I'm gathering the first hasn't happened, and from other comments the second isn't likely, so.  This is likely to be a bellwether of a longer-term issue, though, and you need to gently remind your ex that continuing to push the sibling narrative is only going to make your son resent her.\n\nNTA, and good luck.  I have a sinking feeling you're going to need it.", "NTA. Tell her if letting him go to the party he wants to go makes you an AH in her eyes then tell her to call you cheeks.", "NTA. he is 12 and old enough to decide.  It's your parenting time. Forcing him to prioritize siblings will make him hate them more not less", "NTA, your son is old enough to make his own decisions.  It sounds like he doesn't want to be with his step siblings. So glad you are respecting his boundaries (if any) and requests. Your ex needs to learn how to show respect when it comes to your parenting time.", "NTA.  Your ex is though, if she continues to try to force a relationship with her stepkids he won't want to live with her at all.  If you haven't already been asked, I don't think it will be much longer before your son asks to live with you all the time.", "NTA, I can see why you divorced her.", "Its a clear case of the wedding rule: you always go to the event that you have first accepted, unless you get invited to a wedding - then you go to the wedding", ">said I should be helping him prioritize a family party over a friend party\n\nOh should you? I'm laughing at this. It's your custody time. It's his best friend. He wants to go to that party. He doesn't want to attend step's party. He doesn't even really like the steps. I predict he's going to end up living full time with you. NTA.", "NTA, does she always put stepkids before your son? The fact that she called him after you had said no many times shows that she doesn't care about his feelings and only cares for her own and stepkids.", "Why on earth would you even consider that? It's his best friend vs his step sister? WTF. \n\nNTA\n\non an off note, your ex-spouse should stick his/her attitude where the sun don't shine.

There\u2019s only so many weekends and sometimes you have to miss one. \n\nBut I will say now that you\u2019ve pulled the \u201cthis is my parenting time\u201d card, you need to be prepared for her to do the same thing in the future.", "NTA!
