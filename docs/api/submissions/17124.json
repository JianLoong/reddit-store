You can see the future for your boy when it comes to graduations, weddings etc, and the rows about whether his steps attend/participate, and it\u2019s all likely avoidable if they just back off and let the kids develop a relationship of their own.

He\u2019s only got one childhood", "NTA you are doing what your son want and you\u2019re totally correct if it\u2019s your parenting time you get to do what you want with him on your parenting/visiting time.Because your ex has moved on doesn\u2019t mean that her new kids will automatically be the best of friends with the previous partners kids, and I truly wish people would stop trying to push that because it makes the kids not like them more.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to decide what party he wants to go to. This will be a good learning opportunity for him that it\u2019s okay to prioritize close friends over toxic family. It\u2019s also a good learning opportunity for the stepsister AND your ex that you don\u2019t always get what you want and toxic behavior will make it even less likely that you\u2019ll get what you want.", "It seems to me that if the ex prioritized family she would have scheduled her stepdaughter's birthday party for a day when she had time with her son. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou hit the nail on the head: this is your parenting time. If she wanted him to attend his step sisters party so badly, your ex could have rescheduled it to a weekend in which your son was with her, or negotiated a weekend swap with you. She did neither of those things. \n\nI suspect that even if your son didn\u2019t have prior arrangements, she still would have assumed you\u2019d give up your time with him for the party. Honestly, this sounds like a weird power play - given the way she speaks to you, I assume it wasn\u2019t an amicable separation. I\u2019m glad that he has at least one parent that isn\u2019t intent on disregarding his decisions, and backs him up when needed.", ">She called me an asshole and said I should be helping him prioritize a family party over a friend party, especially when it's a party for a younger sibling. I ignored her. But she texted me again this morning saying she expects me to bring him and I'll be TA if I don't.\n\nI can see why she's your ex, no ability to accept a no.\n\nAnyways, no NTA. People can slap the step-title onto eachother, but it does not a family make. Family is more than that, more than blood, it's about bonds, and frankly sounds like your son has more of a bond with his friend than his step-sisters making the friend closer family than the one's forced on him.", "NTA. \n\nIf his mom wanted him to attend the party, she would have planned it for when she had your son. Planning a family party when your son is with you and expecting him to attend is an asshole move on her part.", "Hell I\u2019m a mother and I\u2019d let my child skip their sibling\u2019s birthday for their best friends party.  They can celebrate with their sibling earlier.", "It depends. I have had it go both ways, especially since my kids have a biggish gap. We always separately celebrate as a family.", "She\u2019s just mad the kids having a good time and still has a good relationship with his dad. Good for this guy and his son alot of times this isn\u2019t the case", "Info: does his SS even want him there? Being she doesn\u2019t. This is just mom trying to play happy family. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m confused.  Was there any prior conversation with you regarding step sisters party & the expectation you\u2019d bring your son during your visitation time?  & how long ago was the step sisters party date set vs your rsvp regarding the best friends party?  Regardless, NTA, your parenting time, your son is old enough to decide which event he wants to attend, assuming you were clear with your ex when the expectation was first raised.", "NTA", "NTA at this age siblings start to do their own things. He can go to his friends and the step sister will have all her friends there at her party I\u2019m sure. If they are that upset about it they can get another cake and do a \u201cfamily party\u201d to celebrate one evening.", "NTA.  Seems like more is going on here, if she wanted him to attend she should have planned the party during her time not yours. At 12 your son can decide.", "NTA - your son is 12 which is old enough to decide what he wants to do. Plus it's YOUR parents time, not hers. If she wanted him to attend the step-sister's party she should have made arrangements and not just assume you and your son would cater to her demands.  She wants you to go to be the bad guy because she doesn't want to own up to her own poor planning/irresponsibility. Take your son to where he wants to go and he can have a good time there!", "NTA, at all. You are respecting your son's choice. And, really, if your son and his stepsister don't get along, you're probably doing her a solid as well.", "So your ex has remarried?\n\nNTA.", "IMO NTA I allow my kids at that age to start doing what they want with there free time. I refuse to force my kids to spend family time. And the choose family enough. Forcing creates resentment", "NTA- The son is old enough to make that choice.", "NTA. Part of growing up is being able to form friendships and make choices. Eventually we all (mostly) prioritize a chosen family over the one we are born into.\n\nBut it can feel incredibly difficult to kids who are navigating not only their family of origin and their own friends, but then are also expected to navigate stepfamilies and associated obligations if divorce and remarriage are involved. \n\nYou are empowering your child to make his own decisions. Good on you.", "NTA. Part of growing up is being able to form friendships and make choices.

He rsvp\u2019d to his friends party first so that\u2019s the party he should be going to. It\u2019s basic social manners 101.", "NTA your son decided to choose. You have obviously decided that he\u2019s old enough to decide. And he\u2019s obviously not fond of his stepsiblings. She should just deal with it.", "NTA\n\nIf it was that important, she should have had the party on her parenting time.", "NTA it's your parenting time, tell her to plan another event on her own time if she wants him there", "Yeah, the worst part for me was her calling the kid. Wielding guilt like a club is not a solid parenting strategy.\n\nNTA OP.", "Yep ! My sons father tries this all the time and my son is only 6. It's shit parenting and makes me sick. As a result, 80% of my parenting is focused on the importance of my sons own emotions and self care over all other things. Not a bad thing, but just sad. I feel like I'm counter parenting instead of just parenting.", "Plus making him go is going to make him super resentful to his step sister - this is more likely to poison their relationship then help it.", "Why would you give up *your* time with your son for a party she could have scheduled on *her* time? Even if all the two of you did was sit at home and snap rubber bands at each other she shouldn't expect him to be at her house on *your* time.", "NTA. 12 is old enough to choose. It's your time. If she wanted to force the kid to be at a particular place and time, it needs to be on her time.", "nta; what everyone else said. \n\nplus, who knows what the birthday girl wants ? maybe she doesn\u2019t want her stepmom\u2019s kid at her party, and mom is pushing because illusion of control, her own issues, whatever.", " NTA and stand your ground dad. Stand up for your son.  Exes are exes for a REASON.  If they were great they\u2019d still be called WIVES.  Fuk her.", "NTA\n\nSeeing as he doesn't like his step siblings, this isn't what the kids want it's what your ex wants. Stick to your guns. Clearly, your ex is doing things that benefits others and herself. Also, the whole family thing is bullshit. Is just a weaponize word to manipulate people. They are family cause your ex got married, they aren't related.", "NTA.\n\nI am also a divorced parent.  I had to stop looking at it as my time or my ex\u2019s time and realize it was our children\u2019s time.  I just have scheduled days to make that time the best I can and the same goes for their dad.  Your son wants to use *his* time to be at his best friends party and should absolutely be there.  NTA at all and good for you for standing up for him.", "NTA", "Nta. But YTA for not cancelling his stepsisters party. They had to call you to find out? Just say he can't attents it", "The point is, it\u2019s your time and your choice. You are respecting HIS choice and your ex made no prior agreement with you for this weekend, which, again, is YOUR time. And now, the day before the party, she\u2019s demanding that you bring y\u2019all\u2019s son the next day? Nope. You made the right decision\u2014NTA.", "NTA It\u2019s your custody day and plans were already made.", "NTA.  He is 12, it\u2019s his best friend\u2019s birthday party.  The stepsister is not going to miss him at her party.  They can have a family birthday dinner together to celebrate but birthdays parties are mostly for the kid and the kid\u2019s friends, not siblings.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why she is so insistent on her son going to his stepsisters party over his best friend. She needs to calm down.", "Doesn't matter though, what matters is what the son wants", "What you've said is quite callous, even for Reddit. Try to put yourself in her shoes: you own something similar to a talking dog, and one day it turns around and snarls at you, instead of obediently doing what you tell it to do. Then you call the co-owner and they tell you that they won't drag it by the collar, and it's old enough to decide where it wants to be. Of course you'd be incensed. \n\nThe mother didn't have to know about what's in his son's calendar. It's only natural that he forfeits any prior commitments that won't mesh with her plans, because what her son wants matters only if it aligns with what mom wants. \n\nNow I'm not saying that my hyperbole is what goes on in OPs post, but some parents don't care about what their child wants, and aren't too enthusiastic about talking things through, 'cause you don't have to negotiate with someone who has no recourse when strongarmed.", "It is his parenting time. She should have made the arrangements on her time if she wanted him there FFS!", "That\u2019s horrifying", "NTA.. You are respecting your son choice something his mother clearly doesn\u2019t give two craps about. Your son has no obligation to his step siblings and owes them nothing. If he clearly stated he wants to attend his friends party your ex needs to respect that. I hated my parents for forcing a relationship between my step siblings and I and it made us hate each other. I would do all I could to avoid spending any time with them. Now as adults their tolerable but I still avoid them for the most part because their all drunks including my own siblings and mother. Your ex is TA here.", "She shouldn't have planned the party on the dad's weekend if she wanted him to be there. If he's not in attendance, this is not life altering. He can always wish her a happy birthday when he gets back to his moms house.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your son's decision. He spends enough time with stepsiblings he doesn't really care for, why should he want to go to a birthday party for one of them? It sounds like it's more important to your ex that he attends than it is to her stepdaughter.", "NTA \n\nHonestly, friends are the family you choose!\n\nSteps are the family someone forced on you!", "NTA. She could have had the party during her parenting time. Your time is your time.", "NTA your son's at an age were you should be letting him make his own decisions not only will forcing him to go will make him miserable but if will also not be enjoyable for his SS did your EX even ask if she wanted him to go I doubt she did", "Your ex's stepdaughter. But not his half-sister or your stepdaughter. That is not his stepsister.  NTA. Maybe that relationship is not beneficial to your son. How old is this girl. Best friend  wins out. You should have declined party when invited,  hopefully"]}
