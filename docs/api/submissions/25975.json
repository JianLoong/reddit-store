It was a long road, her family can be difficult but I love my wife and accepted she came with her family. She has 1 sister Emma (27F) whom my post is about.\n\nEmma asked to stay with us for a week while she saw some friends who live in our city and hotels were too expensive for her. I was hesitant but Laura thought it would be nice to see her sister for a week because they live hours apart now so we set up the guest room for her and agreed.\n\nMy wife is a very picky eater whereas I am not. I proposed a 50/50 split on cooking early in the relationship but my wife's fussiness meant that it is now a 90/10 split where I cook the occasional lunch. I now know never to cook breakfast because my wife is very grouchy when she wakes up and wants to cook breakfast herself since I used to accidentally make it not to her liking. She's more than happy with this arrangement and much prefers it to the 50/50 rule. I have asked multiple times if she wanted me to cook more but she said she likes having the space to cook and have time to herself so we stuck with 90/10.\n\nBecause I never cook us breakfast, I waited for my wife to wake up to cook Emma and myself breakfast - it would have been an hour wait. I thought Laura would want to eat with both of us so myself cooking breakfast just for her sister would have been pointless. Emma is an earlier riser like myself, so when she saw me waiting for my wife to cook breakfast, she was irritated and asked me why I put it all on Laura to cook. I explained the above about why I don't make breakfast and she said that I should put more effort into making Laura breakfast and it would be a nice surprise for her to wake up to breakfast in bed. I explained that I have done in the past but she much prefers to cook herself and that it makes her happy. She called me lazy and trying to make excuses to force Laura to cook for me so I then told Emma to cook her own breakfast if she was that hungry and she left to buy breakfast I'm guessing.\n\nMy wife woke up and asked where her sister was so I explained. She sighed and said it wouldn't have been hard to offer her toast or something low-effort and small until she woke up to cook. I told her that I didn't really appreciate her sister intruding into our cooking dynamic like that, practically insulting me and implying I force her to cook for me while being a guest in our house.\n\nI don't think I am in the wrong here but I am open to all opinions.

So your SIL repaid your free room by criticizing your cooking arrangement and calling you names, and instead of making herself breakfast went out to buy it. No, not the AH.", "NTA Not sure why Emma couldn\u2019t make her own breakfast.", "NTA, wife would have been right if SIL was complaining about HER not getting breakfast, but it sounds like she was taking issue w the cooking arrangement you have with your wife. If she was hungry, she could have asked you to make something small for her, or made something herself since she is staying there for free. Instead she insulted you and more than implied that the cooking arrangements yall mutually agreed upon were somehow you taking advantage or not putting enough effort in.

At the very least just ask if your host minds if you make yourself breakfast. I'm guessing in this case the answer would have been \"Go ahead.\"", "SO...NTA.  I have the same cooking arrangement.  I love to cook and do most of the cooking, which is my choice.  But there are always bagels on hand, toast, eggs to scramble.  Also a sister is different.  At least to me.  She's not a guest, she's family and has free use to my kitchen and can make herself breakfast.  Laura's sister reminds me of my mom's best friend.

But you and your wife are both rude hosts. \n\nYour houseguest is awake, your wife shouldn't be sleeping in for another hour while you tell SIL to poke around in your kitchen to make her own breakfast.

Not even a little bit!  \nSo .... exactly what is Emma's disability?? You are not her manservant and she is not your responsibility. I'm sure she was able to make a piece of toast!  \nAside from that, she has no business criticizing the arrangement that you and your wife are happy with. And she definitely has no right to call you lazy or make accusations about your relationship with your wife. She didn't \"practically\" insult you, she absolutely insulted you.", "YTA because you\u2019ve been with your wife 8 total years and you\u2019re telling me you STILL haven\u2019t figured out what and how she likes her food?  You would \u201caccidentally\u201d cook the breakfast wrong? What was wrong with it? Why were you not able to take direction and just make it to her liking? Sounds like weaponized incompetence to me and you\u2019re using her being a \u201cpicky eater\u201d as an excuse not to do any cooking.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't cook breakfast for you and your GUEST. That is being a bad host. \n\nYou get 90% of your meals cooked for you and couldn't move the gauge to 11% to be a good host and make some eggs.\n\n\"I can't cook you breakfast because breakfast is her meal to cook.\" WTF?", "NTA.\n\nShe's a guest in your home, and she just made you regret your hospitality.", "NTA.

Just small things like the texture of eggs or her seasoning being too much (she prefers less to me). \n\nWe don't always have lunch together and would cook dinner together before she also asked to do that for downtime after work. I did offer to cook more but she said she likes to cook for both of us because it's a way for her to collect herself and unwind after work or to prepare mentally before work. The 90/10 split is more her choice than mine", "I agree you wouldn't expect it as a host, but to expect it the other way around as a guest is also wrong to me.\n\nI definitely wouldn't be criticizing the host for not cooking breakfast for their wife or any other reason. I'll make or get my own if someone isn't offering to make me breakfast and I'm staying at their house. Anything else to do with your food or how you choose to eat it is none of my business.", "I get it, she was being pushy on something that works well for you and your wife. Clearly she doesn\u2019t know how the cooking dynamic works between the two of you and basically refused to listen to you.", "Yeah, she was hungry and thought her host would at least tell her where the cereal was instead of telling her only the wife is allowed to cook breakfast.\n\nDo you want her to not like staying there so a little sabotage to start the day?", "Exactly. Do not reward bad behavior.", "Exactly. I tried my best to tell her what we like to do but she said I was being incompetent on purpose and that \"anyone who actually cared would learn how their wife likes breakfast\"", "Nope, totally get why her attitude was very off-putting! She has no clue how things work for you two, she just assumed."]}
