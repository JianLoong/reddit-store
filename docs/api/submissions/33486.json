I doubt that, since most cleft lips have been surgically repaired to some extent at birth (otherwise they can't properly suck for breastfeeding or bottle feeding) and usually speech isn't too impacted (and she seems comfortable talking shit on the regular).

You trade the bullies suffering, which they themselves provoked, for your own well-being, which they sought to disrupt.\n\nThat seems like a morally fine trade", "Ask the dad to tell her off is the ideal response but, this is an 11 year old and they aren\u2019t perfect so they make a mistake. Both people get in trouble when fights occur because you can\u2019t justify hurting someone because you yourself were hurt", "It's common in many AITA posts to use Y-T-A to call on OP to take a different look at a behavior from the other side that is so egregious and outrageous that accepting that behavior, including the likes of abuse, in itself is wrong.", "because it\u2019s better than doing nothing and crying about your problems like the majority of y\u2019all do", "Counterpoint: Sister needs to learn real fast the old adage of \u201cFuck Around And Find Out\u201d if she\u2019s a couple years away from college with that kind of attitude. \n\nYou think your adopted brother making fun of a cleft lip scar after you insult his dead parents is bad? Wait till you want to date Chad but Beverly has had her eyes on him and believes love is a battlefield. \n\nSister is in for a world of trouble in her future either way without an attitude fix.", ">Correct, you can\u2019t expect an 11 year old to know better, but it\u2019s their job as parents to help guide him.\n\nA 15 year old SHOULD know better than to say something like that.

If anything I\u2019m siding with the boy? But I also think he needs to be told that even in those situations you can\u2019t let your emotions get the better of you.
