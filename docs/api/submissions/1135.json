We were working at the same place.\nBecause of family loss I suffered from severe depression since April. My boyfriend tried to console me at first but after 1 month 'he couldn't handle my sadness'\nHe got in contact with a co-worker (36f; O). He asked me if it was okay for me and I said \"ok\"\n\nIn July he started to take pictures (he never did this before) of places we visited and when I asked him what he's doing, he responded \"I want O to see that I go out, too.\"\nDuring a journey one of the first thing he did, was to take pictures of our hotel room for her! I was mad these days because he wrote messages and took photos for her but didn't talk to me and didn't took pictures of us.\nI exploded on him. We had an argument and he told me that he now knows what kind of a person I am. (always treated him like sh*t and always been selfish)\n\nHe broke up with me 3 weeks later. I lost it completely. I knew he still had contact with O. So I told him that he can now scr*w her as much as he wants. I acted like a storm. He crawled on the sofa crying.\nWe wanted to talk how to \"safe\" our relationship, but than he came home crying that he kissed O I consoled him because he looked sorry. Then we had our conversation and he asked for an open relationship. I was sad, but somehow undestood him. So I said \"okay\" but told him to give me time to quit my job (5 weeks). He also should stop the contact with O. while I'm stuck at my job. He agreed. (End of August)\n\nIn September he had to travel for work. I wanted to spend a nice evening. I bought a cake and cooked his favourite meal, while he was at work.\nThen he called me. The tone of his voice told me what happened. According to him he and O. met secretly because he \"needed a hug\". She also wanted to seduce him. They started kissing and she tried to get his D. But he refused and stormed out. (Another co-worker confirmed.)\nI told him that I'll move out. He begged me not to do so. The next day he went to his journey and I moved out.\n\nAfter that long \"prelude\"; my question:\nSince then we tried the best to rebuild our relationship. We agreed that he has to go no-contact with O. But she still writes him messages and telling him how deep in love she is. He answered her messages. I asked him to stop the contact completely but he refused by saying \"I'm not the type of person who just throw people away like garbage.\" I tried to get over it, but I couldn't. \n\nHe knows I started comparing myself to her and how it's destroying me and my life.(BPD) \nLast week I forced him to break up the online contact. But yesterday he told me that she still talkes to him at school ('You look terrible, is everything alright?' Etc.) I don't mind if it's work-related, but want no private.\nI'm begging him to stop but he refuses because \"it's not polite to ignore someone\" and \"you don't have the right to make that request\".\n\nSo... \nIs he right?
