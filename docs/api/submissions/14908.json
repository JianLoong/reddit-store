I\u2019m really bad with names too.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nIt happens sometimes. You get to know someone in a way that doesn't involve their name, and then the right moment to get it has passed.\n\nYou need to hang out with them in the context of other people somehow. Then a new person can ask their name. You have to be paying close attention and make sure you get it.\n\nLike invite him out to drinks with a friend and have the friend introduce themself, or out to dinner at a place that asks for names when food is ready or take him to Starbucks and pay attention when they ask for the name to put on the cup.\n\nEdited to fix ruling. I forgot there was a no assholes option.", "I don't even know how to judge this.\n\nBut this seems like such a GUY thing--your \"best friend\" is someone you've never bothered to learn his name.  No one has ever said his name AROUND YOU?\n\nHow about a long con?  Say you misplaced your lease and want to look at his?  ask to borrow something that would have his name on it. Library card?  Ask someone in your apt complex office, if you think they can keep their mouth shut.  Surely, if you put a bit of thought into it You could find a way to learn it without admitting your ignorance(pick up mail at same time?)\n\nHave him put his number in your phone?  Ask for his email?  Facebook? something.", "NAH Maybe ask him how he spells it? Hey, I wanted to enter your name into my phone/address book, could you spell it out for me? Or just get drunk together and admit it in a drunken story where it will be a funny memory? Lol", "LOL.. your only hope is he goes on vacation and asks you to collect his mail for him.  If you have any sneak skills you could subtly try to prod a conversation around how shitty your driver's license photo is and ask to see his, while climbing those trees.   \n\nBut this is a relatively minor issue though it seems profound.  Your other solution is bring a third person around who doesn't know the guy and get the third person to introduce themselves \"Hey I'm Rick\" Anonymous guy will usually respond, \"Hey I'm Bill\".  \n\nAnd there you go.\n\nNAH", "Watch him grab his mail and peak over his shoulder. Oh and NTA sounds like you have better conversations than answering what\u2019s your name? What do you do for a living? Where are you from? Etc", "NTA. you obviously didn\u2019t do anything wrong, although you should probably try to figure out his name without obviously doing so. Maybe ask for one of his social medias!", "NAH. You two get along great from what it sounds like, and you can try to learn in a natural way even. Don't worry too much about it, friends are friends. But maybe.. try to learn their name in a subtle way.", ">AITA for not taking the time to get to know his name in the first place?\n\nI mean, kind of I guess? It feels like it takes a certain amount of ignorance above the norm to go an entire year without learning his name while simultaneously giving him a false one to refer to him as for your own ease because... what? You're too embarrassed to ask now?\n\nJust ask him what his name is.\n\nI'm not really sure how to judge this, to be honest. You're not an asshole, but if you go all looney toons trying to figure it out instead of just asking like a normal person then you'll certainly veer that way. NAH for now.", "Weird situation but NTA. I think his gf is the key to learning his name if you want to avoid the awkwardness of revealing that you don\u2019t know it. Listen carefully when she speaks. Eventually she\u2019ll refer to him by name.", "NAH\n\nAsk for his Insta (or other social media) handle.", "NAH.. you could ask to add him on facebook so you can message him later about.. the thing you're currently talking about. If he says yes you get to straight up ask for his facebook name, which is probably his real name and he'd even spell it for you. Then for sure he'd know your name too.", "NTA\u2026 this, this happened to me in college. I have ADHD and names are my kryptonite. I am better now as a real adult \ud83d\ude02but college I was horrible so called everybody, honey, darling etc. Was back in early 90\u2019s not considered offensive, I no longer do it, do not crucify me. Anyway my boyfriend and I lived together in a house on his grandpa\u2019s property and he had a cousin that lived about 2 hours away but I could not remember his name for the life of me for like 2 years. I mean I am a space case but you would have thought I would have picked it up somewhere but nooooo everyone was like me with the babe\u2019s and the darlings. Come to find out his name was Daniel. My great grandfather was Daniel, my grandfather was Daniel, my dad was Daniel and my brother was Daniel. But could I remember that name to save me from hell. Nope I was like burn baby, burn \ud83d\udd25", "Nah but omg I feel for you.\n\nMy go-to move is to add people on FB. Here, type your name here. \n\nOr phone number. Here type your name and number into my phone pliiiz.", "NTA but he's not your \"best\" friend either.  He's your neighbor.\n\nDoes he know your name? In casual conversation one day, you can say you were reminiscing about your school days and remembered nicknames and what your parents called you. Ask him if he had a nickname when he was a kid and what his parents called him. Then after he responds, say \"What was your surname again? I've forgotten.\"\n\nIf you're living in the same building, are the mailboxes labeled?\n\nNow write it down somewhere.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First name was intuitive, last was not. \n\n\"Oh, the regular way to spell Dave! And last name?\" Usually works. \n\nEven Smith  v. Smythe,  Gonzales v. Gonzalez OR be misheard. Oh!
