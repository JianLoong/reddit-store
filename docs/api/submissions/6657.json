Prior to this she had an early diagnosis of another gastric cancer a few years back. It was an early diagnosis, so they were able to take it out and she did not have to go through and chemotherapy. She used to use her sickness as a weapon. I got my belly button pierced and she told me I was going to kill her because of the sight of her seeing my belly button pierced. And that was only the start. Now that she is stage 4 pelvic cancer, I have stopped going out and have been focused on her primarily. It\u2019s been a few months and I\u2019m 22. She is slowly getting better and taking care of herself but she insists we still do everything for her. I recently got sick and she was upset because we were not \u201cdoing our best to get better so we can help her.\u201d My family and I all had the flu, and were bedridden. My brother wanted to see his friend she got mad at the audacity that my brother wanted to go out and was not doing his best to be better and help her. Then after not seeing my friends for a few months they come to my house so I am still home and we START to drink. My mother sees this, and starts yelling at me \u201cyou better not get drunk, how are you going to take care of me, I\u2019m the one that is sick here!\u201d \u201cYou better give me do my nighttime ritual before you get drunk!\u201d She was yelling all of this in front of my friends. In the beginning she would say please and thank you, but now she is demanding and expecting us to just do everything she wants us yo the moment she asks. She craves a food we go buy it for her, if it takes too long she asks \u201cwhere\u2019s my food?\u201d She gets everything she could ever ask for and we have to obey her will because she\u2019s sick. AITA for being tired of taking care of her? What should I do? \n\nP.S. I do understand and want to help her but at this point she\u2019s treating us like servants. Also I say US a lot because it is both my step father and I that are taking care of her.", "created_utc": 1673028961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10517e8/aita_for_being_tired_of_having_to_take_care_of_my/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It got to a point (during one of her fits) i looked straight in her eyes and told her death is only a part of life we can't live for ever.", "Oh my... NTA ofc.", "NTA - It sounds like you are suffering Caretaker Fatigue and it can be brutal to your own mental health and sanity.  I'm sorry that she's become so entitled to feel like she can demand things in such rude ways though.", "NTA\n\nYou are young, move out for your sanity.  You don't deserve this.  Please don't drink, just move out.\n\nShe is being nasty, resentful and using her health issue to control others.\n\nLet her know you will help out with scheduled  cleaning once a week.  \n\nFor her other needs, she can hire a personal caregiver.", "NTA \n\nYou have ever right to be tired of this. \n\nDo you and your family have any other support? There are a lot of group to support not just people with cancer but also their families.", "My first question is what is her nighttime ritual?!  \n\nYou are NOT the AH and need to start setting some serious boundaries because this is going to get worse before it ever gets better.  She sees you as her caregivers for the rest of her days and will keep you in her little nest as long as she can.  It's time to have a talk with mom...an intervention if you will...and let her know that while you love her and want to be around to help her, you cannot sacrifice your happiness and future.  Explain her kind requests has turned into cruel, gaslighting demands and if she doesn't stop, she will push her children away from ever wanting to be around her anymore.  She needs a little wake up call...and you might need to move out.", "NTA\nYou are taking care of her, a lot of people won\u2019t go and help their parents in times of need. You are her child, family she isn\u2019t treating you like family. You also got sick and she is demanding to be taken care of when she clearly has enough energy to yell at you is lame. You need to tell your mom your boundaries or she\u2019s never going to stop. I hope you feel better.", "NTA. If I were you, I'd be drinking, too. (Have one for me!)", "NTA  \nEven if she were a saint about it, i wouldn't hold it against you if you were tired of being someone's caregiver even in the best of situations it exhausting and emotionally draining. Honestly talk to step dad see where he is on her behavior if you can show a untied front about how here behavior is unacceptable it would be better.", "Goodness, NTA. I'm sure the illness is very taxing on her, but it's a huge sacrifice for you, and you should absolutely be able to have your own life as well. It's NOT okay to demand that you focus 100% on her and never do anything else.", "NTA you need to get out of that toxic environment for some time as it's immoral to leave your mom.. But make sure you communicate that to her... This situation is surprisingly very common... My grand pa was like that when he was bedridden and i had to take care of him... I love him but he became davil... You know what I did   , I told my grand pa that look grandpa, this thing I cannot do.. If you still make me do it then I am gona go away... That made him calm for some time.", "NTA - Many people who have children do so with the idea that their children will take care of them in old age.  Heck, some cultures revolve around this notion.  It is AWFUL to be brought into this world as some sort of future servant and it is hard to not become one, especially if you do care about your parent(s).  The guilt, shame, and societal expectation is often too much to just shirk that supposed responsibility, even though it can severely impact that younger person's ability to lead a happy life.  Make sure you are candid (and kind) with your parent in expressing your feelings and expectations if they are willing to listen (which they probably won't be given the abuse that seems to be occurring.)    \n\n\nAlso remember that prolonged illness can have profound psychological effects.  While it is not an excuse for poor or abusive behavior, it can be the reason for it.  If your parent has the capacity to be self-reflective, it's possible you could convey your pain to her in a way that she would resume being respectful to her caretakers.  With some people it takes standing up for yourself to get the message across that you aren't a doormat.  For the most part, the free care you provide her should be on \\*your\\* terms, not hers.", "NTA. If she is unable to take care of herself - she should be in a nursing home until she has recovered enough.", "NAH\n\nShe's going through hell. You haven no idea what that's like and hopefully you nor I will ever had stage 4 cancer and be on chemo. That shit will CHANGE YOU. Make you nasty, mean, say things you never thought you'd hear that person say. \n\nI want you to know I really feel for you. This must be so hard on you and I can't even imagine. It's ok to feel like you don't want to take care of her anymore. Just be aware that she's a human being too.  One with stage 4 cancer. Deep down, she's probably terrified, as any of us would be. She's going to lash out.\n\nBut hang in there, OP", "My sympathy is with your mother. I will go with NAH though.\n\nThe survival rate for pelvic cancer is not good; 85% die within five years of diagnosis. I would think she'd be unhappy and scared about this. Plus all the pain she may be going thru, and treatments. Loss of mobility and independence. My neighbor just died of cancer last month, and his wife said the loss of independence was really hard for him.\n\nI looked after my parents when they were ill. Yes, it can be stressful, and you get resentful about it. Yet now they're gone I still feel guilty that I didn't do enough.\n\nOne thing that helped was when we talked to a social worker. She made us see both sides of the situation. The HMO we used had social workers on staff, so I'd assume her clinic/treatment center/hospital does too. It's really like talking to a counselor. I recommend doing this.\n\nGet her to see that caregivers need care too. Taking a break will help you be a more effective caregiver. See if you can split up the work. If possible, bring in a caregiver now and then; payment for that could be covered by insurance.", "NTA She only treats you like this because you let her get away with it. It is time to stop treating her like a mum and start treating her like a naughty toddler having a temper tantrum. It is time to make baby go stand in the corner. 'you won't get that until you ask nicely. Go to your room until you learn to ....blah blah.'", "NTA.\n\nMy 60-something year old neighbor (we'll call her T) was at this point with her 96 year old mother (we'll call her D) at one point... even with a nurse (we'll call her N) that would come in for 8 hours a day and take care of her.\n\nWell, N took a well-deserved vacation, which meant T would be doing all the work herself, despite having a brother living nearby. D and T didn't have the greatest relationship because T had a career and didn't dote on her parents like her brother did. \n\nAnyway... T asked D if she'd be okay with her getting some help from me and my daughter (my daughter is 19). D said that she was okay with that, because hospice care is not pretty and it had to be agreed upon. \n\nSo, T called me and my daughter and asked us to help. D would often speak poorly to T about her needs \\[just like you're talking about\\], but NEVER acted like that with me, my daughter, nor N the nurse. \n\nSo, there were times that I would let my boss know, \"Hey, I'm going next door, I might be away for an hour or two\"... \\[I work in IT and for awesome company and boss\\]. My daughter and I would relieve T so she could take a break and get away from the verbal abuse. By the time she got back, D would be nicer... my daughter and I would make sure she was not only comfortable, but would ease her mind, stress, and muscles by massaging feet, hands, head and neck. There were times that D would be fast asleep before T got home... which was also a relief.\n\nSometimes... you just need a break and some down time. I know you said that your stepdad was there too, but maybe find out if there's someone that could come in for even just a few hours a day to give you guys some relief and downtime without anyone harping on you.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
