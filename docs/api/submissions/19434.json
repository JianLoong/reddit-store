I hope you can leave this situation soon.", "NTA", "INFO: Why do you have to live there? It sounds filthy and awful. The world is full of better roommate situations.", "How do you figure this? Kids can load dishwashers. Maybe not the 3 year old, but the other 3 should absolutely be able to put their plates, silverware, and cups in the dishwasher.", "I'm confused, did you stop before or after she complained on social media?\n\nAnyway, NTA for not cleaning after her children anymore.\n\nEdit: lol to the downvote without explanation.", "> I (20) live with my partner( 20) and our roommate(35), along with her 4 children, ranging from 14 to 3. We all have jobs.\n\nI just want to know what the 3 year old does for a living.", "This sounds like Hell. Why are you living here? NTA.", "NTA. The kids are her responsibility. If she isn\u2019t teaching them to clean up after themselves she\u2019s setting them up for failure.", "NTA, at the very least the 14 year old could be pitching in too.  Sounds like your roommate needs to get on her older kids about picking up after themselves.", "Never mind who\u2019s the AH. You need to find a new living situation.", "Ok. I see the situation as your roommate, maybe a family member, let you a room in their house. 2 things could make you an AH, if you don\u2019t pay rent and if you eat the food there. \n\nI doubt that as you would have mentioned roommate complaining about those 2 things too. This leads me to believe you contribute financially and buy your own food. \n\nThe idea that roommate thought she\u2019d have additional help with the household chores should have been discussed BEFORE you moved into the house. \n\nYou can sit her down and renegotiate your lease. I\u2019d offer daily dishes and pick up in exchange for 50% reduction as they sound like a handful. However you need to spell out exactly what those duties are and if she says no, exactly what she can (or can\u2019t) expect of you needs to bs spelled out. And texted later as reference. \n\nI\u2019m going Nta because instead of talking to you, she went on social media.", "Especially the part about the soiled pull ups....are they changing this kid anywhere BUT the bathroom?", "NTA.. not your job to clean up after her children.\n\n I hope you both are cleaning up after the spaces that you and your dog live in. That would include your bathroom, your garbage, your dog hair and toys in living areas, dishes, counters and sinks that you use. Along with any home maintenance that renters usually cover.", "NTA time to find a new situation soon.", "NTA. This sounds like a nightmare. Imagine you live in this situation for a reason and cannot move. However, there should be an agreement in place about general upkeep. It should be your/BF responsibility as well as roommates, to contribute to general upkeep cleaning such as mopping, vacuuming, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, etc. But most definitely not when all the children's stuff is spread about cluttering those areas. If you were to live without the children those are normal duties required to maintain a reasonable living condition and should not be ignored but split with reasonable accommodations. Dogs do dirty floors, walls, furniture, contribute to dust, dirt on lower kitchen cabinets/doors, etc. As for dishes, granted you two don't participate in meals cooked by the family then I see no reason to contribute beyond washing what you use. Hopefully you don't just add to the pile. I would personally just address roommate's post, telling her you have seen it and think a fair compromise would be to make an agreement for the cleaning duties of the home.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThis living situation sounds horrible! Time to move out.", "what is the 14 years old doing? i\u2019ve been helping out my parents with cleaning after my younger siblings since i was 11 especially when we\u2019re not at our house. NTA", "Exactly. I think it\u2019s funny that she complains (behind their backs) that the kids shouldn\u2019t clean up after the dogs but she somehow can\u2019t apply that same logic to OP and their partner not having to clean up after HER kids.", "Sounds like a single mom moved in with two adults to help her raise her children, so she can come home that she doesn't have to clean up after 4 kids. \n\nOP, you're closer in age to her eldest child than you are the adult roommate. You and your partner are probably better off finding roommate's either closer in age to you, or are older and child free.", "INFO: You're in your early 20s. Why are you and your partner living with a 35-year-old with 4 kids?? What steps have you taken to get out of that situation?", "What the absolute fuck is that living situation???", "NTA\nIf kids are walking around in full diapers, she\u2019s not a mother.", "Honestly ESH\n\nYour dogs makes messes and the kids make messes.\n\nHonestly why are you as a 20 year old without children living with a 35 year old woman WITH FOUR CHILDREN.\n\nChildren are noisy and messy - four children with a single working mother would be even messier than most families. \n\nWhy would you deliberately want to be in a situation with lots of kids in your 20s", "NTA from the info I could get from your post, but it sounds odd for you and your partner to live with a roommate and roommate's kids. Are you relatives or something? Is the roommate expecting something because of situation that wasn't cleared out in the post, like you two renting a room in her house with written/or verbal contract of helping to maintain the house?\n\nThere was no mention of anything like that so I must assume this is purely three people renting a room from a landlord. In which case the roommate with kids can not assume you two would do anything to clean up after her kids and dogs.\n\nEven if you were renting a room from her, if there's not written or verbal agreement of doing chores that do not belong to you, NTA. \n\nShe can't just expect you to do anything but pay your part of the rent. That's all.", "NTA. Move out ASAP.", "Honestly if you are picking up full nappies from the floor it's probably at the stage you have a moral obligation to call social services. Start to dcument the state of the house and kids with pictures including what you use and what you cleaned. Speak to the kids and get an idea of if they are receiving the care they need. Assess from there. \n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: obv don't take pictures of the kids.", "NTA. Roommates' kids, roommates' responsibility. Time for them to learn about cleaning up after themselves.", "NTA and I really wish there was a way to make sure people having kids are delusional assholes before they have kids but there is just currently no way to be selective about who gets pregnant without it becoming a human rights violation pretty quickly. \n\nBecause the US government likes violating human rights, just to be clear.", "NTA. Sounds fair to me. You clean your mess, she cleans hers and her kids'.", "Take pictures of the messes, especially of the dirty pull-ups and toys. When she posts crap about you not cleaning, post a picture of her kids\u2019 messes with the comment \u201cwhy should a childless couple clean up after your children made the mess?\u201d Save a few pics to show your landlord as well.", "Tell her that, and no you're not.", "NTA. \n\nIs there an overwhelming reason you are continuing to live in this situation? If you can move, do so immediately.\n\nYour roommate is unreasonable and you definitely should not be putting up with this if you have any other option at all. \n\nPlease don't move into a similar dynamic again.", "NTA but you really need to get out of this situation.\n\nShe is the parent and she needs to sort her own kids' messes.", "Whatever you do, definitely don\u2019t have an actual conversation with her about this. Oh wait, maybe that\u2019s worth a try. ESH", "Exactly! I bet the room mate takes up at least 2/3 of the rooms and doesn\u2019t care the kids destroy the common areas so that Op and partner can\u2019t easily use them. There is no way the rent is discounted enough to clean up after not their kids and not to be able to use most of apartment", "Even if it was 1 hour a day of straightening up, that would only be 30 hours for the entire month. It would be very easy to discount a 2 person occupancy for a room at the rate of 30 hours a month. Picking up and doing chores is not highly skilled work. And it certainly isn't the same as providing childcare. Even if they wanted $20/hr, which would be high for providing very light housework most days, that would be $600/month. But most of the days there would be only loading dishwasher at night, emptying it in the morning and picking up toys. That's not going to even take an hour.", "NTA. Try looking some other place to stay.", "Info \n\nWhy are you rooming with this person? Is there a lease? If so when is it up and who has signed it? \n\nCan you afford to find a new place?", "They probably can\u2019t afford their own place.", "Lol I paused for a second over that myself!", "We were rooming with them to get out of my toxic family members' house. The lease is up in december, and the only signature on it is hers. We could, with the next paycheck.", "Why can\u2019t they live with other 20 yr olds who are in the same stage of life though? What 20 yr old wants to live in a place that\u2019s filthy with dirty diapers", "Or, mom and the kids could pick up toys and do their own dishes. Kids need to learn responsibility for cleaning up their own messes. Even the three year old can help put toys back in the toy box.", "Well sure, but I was asking about if there was an agreement. If you follow a train of thought from the earlier comments, I asked about what the rental agreement includes.", "This is a total desaster.

Get out as soon as possible.  They are laughing about the sweet deal they have with housing AND staff.", "NTA.  You signed up to be a roommate, not a 24/7 free babysitter.  What I want to know is, what are the older children doing to help?  Where is the kids' father in all of this?", "She had a baby at 21, and is a single mother, that's... uhhh... suspicious... Did you ask how many baby daddies she has? \n\nAlso, NTA. Move out if you can.", "Which country are you from?", "How much privacy do you and your partner have from the single mom and her kids?", "I had a college roommate that would hang her period stained underwear on our doors and closets, it was SO embarrassing. I talked to her about it, and she said since she didn\u2019t have any issue with it I shouldn\u2019t either (and the friend group we had sided with her for some reason).\n\nThe mom and my old roommate should room together \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I would have left poop stained underwear on her door and use her own words against her, \"Well I dont have a problem with it so you shouldn't either.\""]}
