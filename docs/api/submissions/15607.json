When my cousin got married, she asked me a few months ahead if I would film it as a wedding gift. She said if I didn\u2019t want to I didn\u2019t have to. The act was the gift to her, so she offered to reimburse me for gear rental if I needed it.\n\nShe recognized that I have a skill and wanted me to apply that towards a cherished family memory.

Also, I cannot be responsible for how different peoples skin may react to new/different products...", "NTA\n\nThe initial makeup offer for those who can't do it themselves was generous.

I'll give your grandma the benefit of the doubt that she was well intentioned and simply doesn't understand the time and effort that goes into doing a full face of makeup for an event like a wedding, so she thought it was *'only'* volunteering a fraction of the time it is in reality but, yeah, people can't go volunteering your time, skills, and (I'm guessing pricey) products, *for free*.

They should have checked with you first, and you should have the option to say NO especially considering it\u2019s unpaid work. No one should expect work for from you for free unless you voluntarily offered to do so. It can be difficult enforcing these kinds of boundaries with family, but it\u2019s worth standing your ground imo. It\u2019s exploitation, plain and simple.", "NTA You're are not being selfish and they are being inconsiderate.

Give it all to your grandmother and let her know that she can reimburse you since she already promised everyone else that it would be free.", "NTA. You previously agreed to help your mom, aunt, and grandma with their makeup for the wedding, which was reasonable. However, being asked last minute to do a full face of makeup for three cousins is unreasonable, especially considering the additional costs and time it would take away from your own preparation and relaxation time. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and overwhelmed. Your family should respect your boundaries and not expect you to do something beyond what was previously discussed. It's important to set limits and prioritize your own well-being.", "NTA. Your grandma had no right to offer you up like that. Its rude. Your cousins should've asked about that sooner so you could get everything you need. Not to mention, you're traveling to Jamaica for a wedding and wedding events.
