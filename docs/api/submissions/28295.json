Seriously girl you need help.", "NTA\n\nBut you should never have married into this family. \n\nYour husband has shown you from the start that he is NEVER going to take your side. He has allowed his mother to steamroll right over you, starting with pushing you into converting to a religion you didn't particularly believe in and marrying her son just because you were pregnant. Have you even stopped to think about the fact that it wasn't your husband who ultimately proposed to you, but his mother?  \n\nHis mother has been running your relationship since before you were married, and now she is deciding how your child will be raised, including exposing him to *potentially deadly diseases within 24 hours of his birth* (and honestly, I'm side-eyeing you for not throwing them out, but it's not entirely your fault because you were exhausted from childbirth). There was no point \"insisting\" on them being vaccinated if you weren't going to follow through. But the real point is that your husband doesn't have your back and HE NEVER HAS. \n\nPeople here are saying, \"You need to get your husband to tell her . . .\" Um, no. Your husband is never going to do that. He showed you that before you were ever married, when he let her bully you into converting and marrying him in the first place. His mother is the boss of him, and he doesn't care what she does to you. She will always come first, in your marriage, with your baby, and with everything else.\n\nSo you have two choices: accept that you are never going to have a voice in your own marriage or in what happens with your kids, or GET OUT. As it is, you're still going to have to deal with this woman now because she will be your child's grandmother forever. But the smartest thing you can do is walk away from this marriage and establish a separate household ASAP, where she has no say, and you can feel like yourself again. Because until you do, your mental health is going to suffer as you find that your voice continues to go unheard and dismissed in every facet of your own marriage and life.
