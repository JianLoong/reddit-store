{"id": 7730, "submission_id": "10g1wn5", "title": "AITA for not adding my SIL to the lease?", "selftext": "I and my SO rent a house that my dad owns. My brother used to live in the area but he moved out of state over a year ago with his wife. He's currently going through a hard time financially, after he moved his wife didn't work for a year (Idk why) and they racked up close to 200k in debt. My dad agreed to loan him 1/3 of that to help him get his head above water. They both make good money but the move to a high cost of living state and his wife not working put them in a bad spot. I'm concerned for his mental health and that he might hit a breaking point. Two days ago I called him and he said he was coming to visit and I was excited. He rarely makes time to see me when he visits and I thought maybe that changed.. but he wanted something. Apparently my SIL who is a nurse had her contract cancelled and doesn't have a job. In two weeks her license expires unless she renews it but he claims she can't in the state they live in because she'd have to retake tests etc. It would be easier for her to renew in our state but she needs to prove residency. He wanted me to sublet a room to her to prove residency and at first I agreed. But then it started sounding fishy. He wanted me to send my utility bills so he could forge her name on them, send her mail back to her but not forward because that would let them know she moved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent him a text telling him I didn't want to be involved. It sounds like fraud. He claims it isn't because she will actually be renting a room and I could add her to the utilities. I told him no and cut contact because my brother has a history of harassment if he doesn't get what he wants. I told him if my dad wanted to sign a lease for her he was welcome to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother started texting and calling, he went to my dad about it and I started getting texts from my dad saying as my landlord I need to sign the lease. I told him no that's something he needs to do. Then he texted me saying as my landlord he needs to make sure my utilities are on and he's requiring me to send him the utility bills and add my SIL to them. Which is bs, he just doesnt want my SIL to lose her job or her license (my brother didn't tell him about the job). I also don't understand why I'm hearing about this now two weeks before her license expires. She's been a nurse for 10+ years, it's not like this renewal would be a surprise to her. The whole thing is odd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped responding to both my dad and my brother and haven't answered their calls. I've gotten nasty texts from my brother about how I don't care about family. And I know I can't ignore my dad forever because he's my landlord. My dad signed the lease for him but I don't want any involvement with the utilities or mail. If it is address fraud I don't want to be connected to it. But simply adding her name to the utilities and sending my dad a copy seems like a small line to draw in the sand over my brother's financial and mental ruin and they both think I'm an AH for it.

You don't want to get dragged into this whole thing if something does go wrong or something is flagged in a system somewhere. It may seem unlikely to happen, but some states take this sort of thing extremely seriously. \n\nMy father has been using his sister's address as his main residence for years because he works at a campground in the summer and stays at an off-season hotel on the beach during the winter, and needed a mailing address for things like his license (his state doesn't accept PO boxes). Sure enough, it got flagged in a system after a few years and he had to fight like heck to prove there wasn't some illegal motive behind what was happening. \n\nBut...I also get a really bad feeling about this, and think there may be more to this story. I'm not so sure I believe this is truly just about her nursing license being about to expire. Maybe I've just read too much Reddit, but something seems...Off.", "NTA. It does sound like they're engaged in some sort of fraud.\n\nLet your father rent her a room in *his* house\u2014or doesn't he live in-state, either?", "nta.  I'd nope out of this entirely when the lease ended.  And... don't you ahve to live in a state for 6 months or so to get residency?", "NTA, you are awesome! Hold your ground. They are bullying you. You don\u2019t need to get involved in this illegal activity. Also, in many areas, it may be illegal for your landlord to request copies of your utility bills. Only government entities (school systems, etc.) can request that (and they can\u2019t specify that it has to be utility bills). \n\nI would send each of them a typed and signed letter VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, that you refuse to add your \u201cinsert full name\u201d to your lease and utility bills which is illegal as she doesn\u2019t live there and thus would constitute fraud. Include in the letter that they are not to contact you again with regard to this matter, or you will file a report of harassment. \n\nThen be sure to take screenshots of all the texts you already have. If they contact you again, your best course of action may be to file harassment charges against your landlord (father I know) because he is violating your lease (a term called \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d). Technically, your brother isn\u2019t doing anything illegal-he\u2019s as annoying as a telemarketer, but your dad is. A landlord is not permitted to harass a tenant. \n\nAnd I guess it\u2019s time to find a new place to move to.", "NTA.\n\nYou are correct, they are asking you to at least help them commit fraud (accessory), if not committing it yourself.\n\nIf they want to forge shit, they don't need your help or address, they can pick another house.", "NTA. That does sound sketchy and like poor planing on her part. If she\u2019s a nurse and having employment issues that\u2019s a serious red flag. They are in high demand.", "NTA\u2026 stick to your guns.", "NTA, what they\u2019re doing is fraud. Don\u2019t implicate yourself in any way.", "NTA - The minute she\u2019s on the lease and utilities, she has control over things that affect you. Even if I knew their intentions were good, I wouldn\u2019t be okay with that.\n\nOut of curiosity though, does dad live in the same state as you? If so, it seems like Dad could put his own address down and add her to his own utilities. The fact that they\u2019re so stuck on it being your house that she\u2019s added to is really shady to me.", "NTA. Sounds fishy to me as well and you shouldn't do something you're not comfortable with. It doesn't matter that she is \"renting the room\" its not her place of resident. Which is what they want so sounds like fraud to me. They are adults they need to figure things out. Your dad needs to stop constantly stepping in and helping them.

Good for you. Next step is to move out so your dad has no leverage over you going forward. He tried to abuse his position as your landlord to force you to do something illegal.", "NTA but you might want to call the nurse licensing board in your SILs new state and let them know what she's trying to do. Literally, you just need to google (state name) nurse licensing board and call the contact number on the website.", "NTA.  They are committing fraud and not only want you to participate they don't get a shit about how it can also ruin your finances.

My brother has a history of doing shady shit and this is what he's told me but I believe there's more he's not telling my dad or I.

He's actually not helped my brother much over the years because of how shady my brother can be but he's concerned for his mental state. They're both kind of bullies though because if they don't get what they want they start threatening this or that. But my dad also doesn't know half the stuff my brother has done and I don't understand him sending my dad after me when I keep secrets for him.", "And making sure most of your mail is digital, so they have no access to anything they can use for their shady dealings.\n\nHell, I'd lock down your credit ASAP. It's a wretched thing, when you're afraid of fraud with family.", "Unfortunately that would almost ensure my dad never sees his money again. Which I understand isn't my responsibility but it would completely alienate me from both my brother and my dad/landlord as well", "Oh dear, that actually explains a lot, and clears up a few questions I had when I read the post (200k debt in a few years? Why is she not working during all of this? Why would she only now decide to get back into work?)\n\nOkay, yeah, they're definitely getting involved with something illegal that's far more serious than fraud. Who knows if it's some sort of scam or drug-related, but make it clear to your father that you can't put yourself at risk, and put emphasis on their history. I'd try to reason with your father, mostly to help him avoid getting into a bad situation himself, but I have a feeling he's just clinging to hope that your brother and his wife finally want to turn things around (and I'm sure it doesn't help that he's probably worried he'll never see the money he loaned them if she doesn't start working).", "You made the right decision to protect yourself - never break the law to 'help' someoneelse as it will come to haunt you.\n\nAlso, if you put her on the lease she could just show up and move in if she and husband sink further into debt.", "Both I and my SO have a lease with my dad. Which is part of what made me suspicious because we signed electronically but my brother was insistent on me signing the lease at first because he said he needed an in person signature.", "NTA - I was going to make the same suggestion.  Just remember, what is happening here is essentially a conspiracy to enable someone who may have drug use issues and heaven only knows what other problems to continue to practice in a profession where vulnerable people could be endanagered.  I can see why you have some concerns about your dad, although his participation in this makes him just as complicit as your brother and SIL, but it doesn't sound as if the relationship with your brother is the biggest thing to worry about here.", "Thanks!  One thing you might consider is having a one time consult with an attorney.  This won't cost much and it doesn't obligate you to anything.
