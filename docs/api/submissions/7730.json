{"id": 7730, "submission_id": "10g1wn5", "title": "AITA for not adding my SIL to the lease?", "selftext": "I and my SO rent a house that my dad owns. My brother used to live in the area but he moved out of state over a year ago with his wife. He's currently going through a hard time financially, after he moved his wife didn't work for a year (Idk why) and they racked up close to 200k in debt. My dad agreed to loan him 1/3 of that to help him get his head above water. They both make good money but the move to a high cost of living state and his wife not working put them in a bad spot. I'm concerned for his mental health and that he might hit a breaking point. Two days ago I called him and he said he was coming to visit and I was excited. He rarely makes time to see me when he visits and I thought maybe that changed.. but he wanted something. Apparently my SIL who is a nurse had her contract cancelled and doesn't have a job. In two weeks her license expires unless she renews it but he claims she can't in the state they live in because she'd have to retake tests etc. It would be easier for her to renew in our state but she needs to prove residency. He wanted me to sublet a room to her to prove residency and at first I agreed. But then it started sounding fishy. He wanted me to send my utility bills so he could forge her name on them, send her mail back to her but not forward because that would let them know she moved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent him a text telling him I didn't want to be involved. It sounds like fraud. He claims it isn't because she will actually be renting a room and I could add her to the utilities. I told him no and cut contact because my brother has a history of harassment if he doesn't get what he wants. I told him if my dad wanted to sign a lease for her he was welcome to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother started texting and calling, he went to my dad about it and I started getting texts from my dad saying as my landlord I need to sign the lease. I told him no that's something he needs to do. Then he texted me saying as my landlord he needs to make sure my utilities are on and he's requiring me to send him the utility bills and add my SIL to them. Which is bs, he just doesnt want my SIL to lose her job or her license (my brother didn't tell him about the job). I also don't understand why I'm hearing about this now two weeks before her license expires. She's been a nurse for 10+ years, it's not like this renewal would be a surprise to her. The whole thing is odd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped responding to both my dad and my brother and haven't answered their calls. I've gotten nasty texts from my brother about how I don't care about family. And I know I can't ignore my dad forever because he's my landlord. My dad signed the lease for him but I don't want any involvement with the utilities or mail. If it is address fraud I don't want to be connected to it. But simply adding her name to the utilities and sending my dad a copy seems like a small line to draw in the sand over my brother's financial and mental ruin and they both think I'm an AH for it.

If she has been a nurse for as long as you say ots pretty rare they make you retake the test as you would have professional references that can be utilized but this varies by state. If your dad wants to help them he can put her on his bills, there is a reason he's shifting it to you and if it blows up he won't take the blame or suffer the consequences. Also wife has no family? Why does it fall to you? This all seems so odd.", "Call the licensing board if they don't stop harassing you.  That should get them off your back.", "NTA. Don\u2019t get involved in this. I\u2019m trying to think of a reason your SIL would have to retake her licensure test. I\u2019ve moved states a few times (RN), and had to submit transcripts and license numbers, but never retake the test. I looked it up, and here\u2019s what I found:  \n\nhttps://allnurses.com/do-re-take-nclex-move-t414704/\n\n\nWhatever is going on here, it sounds shady. Don\u2019t get involved in this.", "NTA", "NTA, I think is quite fishy SHE KNOWS she had to renew but only worried 2 weeks before her license ends?\n\nWhen your brother is in so much debt?\n\nI wouldn't sign either, no matter how my father/ brother called me", "Yeah, this is a 100% BS story.  She had PLENTY of time to renew and do whatever - if she didn't, it was a choice on her part, and hey, probably why she lost her contract.  I mean, there's no shortage of nurse jobs out there. \n\nLet Dad put her on HIS utilities, that'll solve the problem.  NTA, you need to both stay out of this and find a new place to live.", "NTA - The whole thing sounds like fraud to me.  You're going to have to make a difficult choice since your Dad is willing to drag you into fraud for his convenience.\n\nTell you Dad that if he doesn't remove your SIL from the lease that you will be moving and you will be returning mail to anyone but you and your SO to the sender.  Further that as long as the utilities are in your name, you will not be sending him a copy.  If he puts the utilities in his name so he can add your SIL you will be moving.  If he forces you and your SO to move, you will go LC or NC because you absolutely will not get dragged into fraud.\n\nThen do it.  Get a PO box and start forwarding your mail.  Pack up and move somewhere with a landlord not related to you (issues on it's own that at least won't involve fraud).\n\nYou are Not responsible for your brother's 'financial and mental ruin'.  Those are the consequences of his and his wife's actions.", "NTA. How does someone wrack up $200K worth of debt in a year? Did they have a medical crisis?", "NTA. This screams of something fishy.\n\nIt's on my mind because tax season just started, but are there any huge tax differences between your states? Like no income tax or no sales tax? I remember the border of Oregon and Washington was tax fraud central because one had no sales tax and one had no income tax.", "NTA. Are you sure the texts from your dad are actually from your dad and not someone using your dad's phone?\n\nAlso, ask yourself this: Is dad just completely stupid and ignorant about your brother's shady business, or is he complicit and willing to forcibly throw you under the legal bus just so he gets  his money back?\n\nA lot of commenters have already suggested how to report this. It's up to you if you think dad is worth protecting.", "NTA. Report her to the certification agency.", "NTA. This is fraud. If she wants to, she can establish something at that address, like a meal subscription or her cell phone bill. But don't give her any control over your actual utilities. That's super sketchy. Keep all messages for the inevitable lawsuit. Sorry, but this is going to get ugly.", "NTA. No expert here, but I believe each state has licensing requirements. You can't automatically work in one state because you have a license in another. There is a nurse licensure compact which allows you to practice in multiple states. So all this fraud being committed to look like SIL is residing in one state in order to work in another doesn't make sense.", "NTA", "NTA = Not the Asshole.\n\nWhat your brother is suggesting absolutely IS fraudulent, and this could come back to bite you in the arse end. And even though your Dad is your landlord, he's also being an A-hole in this regard. If you add her name to the lease, etc. it opens the door for her and your brother to potentially claim that you were wrongfully denying them the right to move in, and it's possible he'd coerce your Dad into allowing this intrusion as well. \n\nAnd this is possibly the whole purpose behind your brother's request. To become unwanted room-mates.", "NTA - don't be responsible for adding her name to anything. However perhaps you should look at getting housing that isn't dependent on family property.", "NTA. Be careful. She may be able to move in now", "why can't SIL live with her FIL. In HIS HOME? NTA\n\nLove the way everybody has the solution but it involves YOU. UGH!!!!!!!", "There is a huge shortage of nurses currently in the US making it very suspicious that she couldn\u2019t get another job. It is also suspicious (weird) that with one partner out of work but the other working, they racked up $200,000 of debt. Sounds like she either did something unethical (obviously she isn\u2019t afraid to be unethical) or drugs. That debt could be legal fees? \n\nNo way would I let my name get tangled up with theirs. I can\u2019t believe your dad is going along with this and putting you in jeopardy to do it.", "NTA.\n\nHow in the *WORLD* do you rack up $200k in debt in less than 2 years?!?!? There is some shady crap going on..... or they are gambling, doing drugs, etc.  \n\nKeep yourself out of this.  And you better find a new place to live, so you arent dragged into this.", "Yeah, this thing stinks all the way through.  OP should consider moving somewhere else where he's not renting from his dad.", "If OP has a signed lease, the terms of the lease can't be changed without OP's signature until the lease is up.   When the lease is up, the landlord can renegotiate.  But right now, OP has a contract signed by both parties as to residency of this address.   Unless OP signs a new contract that includes SIL,  he should be good at least until his lease is up.  \n\n\nAnd YEAH, this whole thing smells fishy to me, too.  Are they trying to establish SIL as a resident so they can move her and BIL in,  and force OP out?   Maybe BIL got in Dad's ear and is pressuring him for a cheap place to live.", "I know it would be a major hassle, but personally contact the sender of any such mail to explain she doesn't live there.

A problem with utilities is that, where I am, you can switch names on those utilities at the drop of a hat.
