{"id": 7730, "submission_id": "10g1wn5", "title": "AITA for not adding my SIL to the lease?", "selftext": "I and my SO rent a house that my dad owns. My brother used to live in the area but he moved out of state over a year ago with his wife. He's currently going through a hard time financially, after he moved his wife didn't work for a year (Idk why) and they racked up close to 200k in debt. My dad agreed to loan him 1/3 of that to help him get his head above water. They both make good money but the move to a high cost of living state and his wife not working put them in a bad spot. I'm concerned for his mental health and that he might hit a breaking point. Two days ago I called him and he said he was coming to visit and I was excited. He rarely makes time to see me when he visits and I thought maybe that changed.. but he wanted something. Apparently my SIL who is a nurse had her contract cancelled and doesn't have a job. In two weeks her license expires unless she renews it but he claims she can't in the state they live in because she'd have to retake tests etc. It would be easier for her to renew in our state but she needs to prove residency. He wanted me to sublet a room to her to prove residency and at first I agreed. But then it started sounding fishy. He wanted me to send my utility bills so he could forge her name on them, send her mail back to her but not forward because that would let them know she moved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent him a text telling him I didn't want to be involved. It sounds like fraud. He claims it isn't because she will actually be renting a room and I could add her to the utilities. I told him no and cut contact because my brother has a history of harassment if he doesn't get what he wants. I told him if my dad wanted to sign a lease for her he was welcome to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother started texting and calling, he went to my dad about it and I started getting texts from my dad saying as my landlord I need to sign the lease. I told him no that's something he needs to do. Then he texted me saying as my landlord he needs to make sure my utilities are on and he's requiring me to send him the utility bills and add my SIL to them. Which is bs, he just doesnt want my SIL to lose her job or her license (my brother didn't tell him about the job). I also don't understand why I'm hearing about this now two weeks before her license expires. She's been a nurse for 10+ years, it's not like this renewal would be a surprise to her. The whole thing is odd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped responding to both my dad and my brother and haven't answered their calls. I've gotten nasty texts from my brother about how I don't care about family. And I know I can't ignore my dad forever because he's my landlord. My dad signed the lease for him but I don't want any involvement with the utilities or mail. If it is address fraud I don't want to be connected to it. But simply adding her name to the utilities and sending my dad a copy seems like a small line to draw in the sand over my brother's financial and mental ruin and they both think I'm an AH for it.

You don't want to get dragged into this whole thing if something does go wrong or something is flagged in a system somewhere. It may seem unlikely to happen, but some states take this sort of thing extremely seriously. \n\nMy father has been using his sister's address as his main residence for years because he works at a campground in the summer and stays at an off-season hotel on the beach during the winter, and needed a mailing address for things like his license (his state doesn't accept PO boxes). Sure enough, it got flagged in a system after a few years and he had to fight like heck to prove there wasn't some illegal motive behind what was happening. \n\nBut...I also get a really bad feeling about this, and think there may be more to this story.

You don\u2019t need to get involved in this illegal activity. Also, in many areas, it may be illegal for your landlord to request copies of your utility bills. Only government entities (school systems, etc.) can request that (and they can\u2019t specify that it has to be utility bills). \n\nI would send each of them a typed and signed letter VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, that you refuse to add your \u201cinsert full name\u201d to your lease and utility bills which is illegal as she doesn\u2019t live there and thus would constitute fraud. Include in the letter that they are not to contact you again with regard to this matter, or you will file a report of harassment. \n\nThen be sure to take screenshots of all the texts you already have. If they contact you again, your best course of action may be to file harassment charges against your landlord (father I know) because he is violating your lease (a term called \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d). Technically, your brother isn\u2019t doing anything illegal-he\u2019s as annoying as a telemarketer, but your dad is.

I'd try to reason with your father, mostly to help him avoid getting into a bad situation himself, but I have a feeling he's just clinging to hope that your brother and his wife finally want to turn things around (and I'm sure it doesn't help that he's probably worried he'll never see the money he loaned them if she doesn't start working).", "You made the right decision to protect yourself - never break the law to 'help' someoneelse as it will come to haunt you.\n\nAlso, if you put her on the lease she could just show up and move in if she and husband sink further into debt.", "Both I and my SO have a lease with my dad.
