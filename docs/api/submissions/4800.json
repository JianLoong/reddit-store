They live out of state so I don\u2019t have much interactions with them. They\u2019re currently visiting and I have a limit on how much time I can spend with SIL before I can\u2019t stand her anymore.\n\nMy family plan things but we like to go with the flow. If we plan on going to breakfast, there\u2019s no set time and we\u2019ll go whenever everyone is up and ready. SIL is different in that she plans out everything down to the very minute we need to leave. If we don\u2019t leave at her exact time, she gets stress and it\u2019s annoying. She can also be incredibly rude. The other day I made a comment about how I need to go for a run because I\u2019m gaining some weight. She looks at me and said my belly does look bigger and I\u2019m getting a double chin. I was about to say something back but my brother quickly joked it off then pulled her into the bedroom.\n\nThis morning we (parents, siblings and significant others) were all sitting around enjoying our coffee when SIL started talking about dinosaurs. I tuned her out after 5 minutes but she went on for another 30 minutes. I finally had enough so I tried to tactfully change the topic by asking my dad about his plan to buy an electric car. We talked about it for less than 1 minute when I said it\u2019s cool how electric cars can run without using gas. This is when SIL jumped in and said that gas comes from oil which mostly comes from plants that layered on top of each other because bacteria needed for decay didn\u2019t exist yet because this was before the time of dinosaurs and just like that, we were back listening to her dinosaur facts. I had enough so I stood up and told SIL I don\u2019t care about dinosaurs and don\u2019t want to hear any more facts about them. I left and went to my room.\n\nMy mom came in and said she understood my frustration but I was rude for saying that and need to apologize. I argued SIL was rude for dominating the conversation with a topic no one cares about. \n\nShould I have stayed and listened about dinosaurs for another hour?", "created_utc": 1671121089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmp25p/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_dont_want_to_talk_about/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Such characteristics are extremely typical of such.", "NTA. guys even if SIL is on the spectrum it\u2019s rude and at most changes my opinion to a NAH. but sil should try to learn to control info dumping and controlling conversations either way.", "I mean, for one she has no tact whatsoever if she is making thoughtless comments about your weight. Saying you're worried about weight gain is no excuse to double down and insult you when you show any insecurity. Being pushy about time suggests she came from a tight scheduled home and you guys NOT being on a timetable is likely a stress for as well even if that makes no sense to non-time tabled based homes.\n\nIf you said that in a matter of fact manner like you did in this post, NTA. You're entitled to be able to change the subject after half an hour and she needs to learn to go with the flow. (Is there any chance she is on the Autistic spectrum? This doesn't excuse her behavior but might help to explain her lack of decorum.)\n\nIf you screamed, shouted, cussed, or otherwise flew off the handle then I'd change my vote. This being said you can only \"kill someone with kindness\" for so long.", "NTA your SIL sounds exhausting\n\nSaying that you want to go on a run is not an invitation for her to say you\u2019ve got a belly and a double chin!! How rude! I\u2019d have had a lot to say if someone talked to me like that. \n\nAnd while I see everyone saying that a 30 minute info dump about dinosaurs can point towards her being neurodivergent, it could also just be that she\u2019s being annoying? Like, not everyone who you perceive as socially unaware or rude is neurodivergent??

I'd rather talk about dinos than electric cars", "Soft YTA, it could've been phrased better, a simple I'll be back, then not come back could've sufficed, or a \"let's change the topic\". You were definitely pretty blunt with your phrasing.

She\u2019s on the spectrum \u2026 super literal", "YTA. This was a family discussion - not one between just you and SIL. And the way you went about it was AHish... trying to switch topics was fine, but I guess they didn't care to.

You could have just said \"excuse me\" and removed yourself.", "YTA but I understand your frustration even though I think there is something more with SIL as the other comments mentioned.", "I mean, sort of you could have just left the room.", "Info: Is your SIL neurodivergent? (On the Autism Disorder Spectrum)\n\nMore info: How old are you?\n\nSoooo,After reading your post, your SIL sounds just like my daughter who is neurodivergent. She is extremely direct and has little use for \"social graces.\" She can ~~talk~~ monologue for hours on subjects that interest her with teeny tiny factoids and stats about whatever the subject may be (from Pokemon to microbiology and genetics). She is also obsessive about structure. Especially time. These tendencies become more obvious when she is a little stressed (Maybe like visiting in-laws for the first time in a couple years....)\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\n\nAll of this aside, you were rude to your brother's wife who is a guest in your parents home. I can understand frustration at someone commandeering the conversation, but perhaps take a moment to consider your SIL's brain may work a different way than yours does and allow her some grace.\n\nWas going to go with NAH  but you were rude and went pouting to your room.\n\nVERY soft YTA\n\n\\*ETA If SIL is neurodivergent and has chosen not to divulge that to OP or OP's parents, that is her right.

I finally had enough\n\nIt sounds like you didn't really tune her out after all. YTA, tune her out for real or just leave the room, no need to be rude. \n\nOr work on your conversation skills, she steered the electric car discussion back to dinosaurs, but that's not game-set-match, you could have redirected again.", "YTA she\u2019s passionate about dinosaurs it was a group conversation you could have walked away at any time and also dinosaurs are great", "Ditto on thinking she's on the spectrum for being insensitive to remarks.\n\nBut YTA for making it into a scene when she was having a conversation with the GROUP that you decided to take as a personal offense. And frankly, you brought up electric cars, so it was a revelant tangent.", "Info: have they told you that sil is autistic?

But better at reading social question than your sil at least.", "YTA. \n\nYes, you were rude. No need for that.\n\nAnd do you have any idea how annoying it is for some one to \u201cgo with the flow\u201d when others might be on a schedule? You may not have sh*t to do the rest of the day but others might have other plans. Go with the flow on your own. This is an excuse to be late everywhere.", "YTA for saying SIL is rude for 'dominating the conversation'. You're welcome to add input at any time, or you know, talk to someone else. \n\nAlso, SIL sounds neurodivergent off the charts. I myself am. From being meticulous to a time schedule to not having social cues, you can't hold that against her unless she's being cruel just to be cruel which it doesn't sound like.", "Your SIL sounds like she may be on the spectrum. You're still TA though for being so hateful.", "YTA. The way you describe her she sounds neurodivergent. And you didn't need to be rude like that.", "YTA.  We wouldn't get along for sure.", "YTA your SIL sounds like she may be autistic (speaking from experience) so yeah you sound so ableist.", "YTA. The fact that she annoys you is a you problem and doesn't justify you treating her badly. It's perfectly reasonable to find someone annoying, but you have more options than either listening to dinosaurs for an hour or being rude and hurtful to her. I agree with others that it sounds like she's on the spectrum and you're just being intolerant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
