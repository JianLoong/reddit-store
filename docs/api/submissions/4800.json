If we plan on going to breakfast, there\u2019s no set time and we\u2019ll go whenever everyone is up and ready. SIL is different in that she plans out everything down to the very minute we need to leave. If we don\u2019t leave at her exact time, she gets stress and it\u2019s annoying. She can also be incredibly rude. The other day I made a comment about how I need to go for a run because I\u2019m gaining some weight.

I was about to say something back but my brother quickly joked it off then pulled her into the bedroom.\n\nThis morning we (parents, siblings and significant others) were all sitting around enjoying our coffee when SIL started talking about dinosaurs. I tuned her out after 5 minutes but she went on for another 30 minutes. I finally had enough so I tried to tactfully change the topic by asking my dad about his plan to buy an electric car. We talked about it for less than 1 minute when I said it\u2019s cool how electric cars can run without using gas. This is when SIL jumped in and said that gas comes from oil which mostly comes from plants that layered on top of each other because bacteria needed for decay didn\u2019t exist yet because this was before the time of dinosaurs and just like that, we were back listening to her dinosaur facts. I had enough so I stood up and told SIL I don\u2019t care about dinosaurs and don\u2019t want to hear any more facts about them. I left and went to my room.\n\nMy mom came in and said she understood my frustration but I was rude for saying that and need to apologize.

I don\u2019t feel like I can get breakfast because at any second other people can just get up and decide that they are ready to go. \n\nI know it\u2019s just an example but I think this is one of those situations where no one is right and no one is wrong, there are just different ways people prefer to do things. \n\nOP It sound like SIL is on the spectrum and I encourage you to seek out resources on understanding what She is going through and how her brain processes and reacts to information. \n\nI came to the realization that my mother and I both have ADHD. But my mother refuses to even consider it. She grew up in rural Mexico and the culture has a hard time viewing mental health, ADHD, autism etc as real. But I started doing research and when I tell you it COMPLETELY changed the way I viewed myself, my brain and my mom, I\u2019m not exaggerating. \n\nSuddenly so much started making sense and I was able to understand and relate to why my mother does certain things or reacts in certain ways.", "My first thought!", "Yeah but being on the spectrum doesn\u2019t make it not rude", "I agree that it sounds like she is autistic, but that\u2019s an explanation, not an excuse. SIL should be getting resources and support but that doesn\u2019t excuse calling people fat or monopolizing conversation. and I say that as an auDHD adult who has had to learn these lessons too.", "Got the same vibes. I'm neurodivergent and likely on the austism spectra. I have a \"super interest\" that I can easily dominate a conversation with for an hour or so...", "Literally everything OP is complaining about sounds like my autistic + ADHd self. \n\nAlso how old are you OP? (Please tell me 17 or younger).", "This post screams ASD to me too. Schedule stress, lack of filter, hyper focusing on special interests If OP didn\u2019t know about the SILs ND then they prob just assume this person is intentionally being rude or self absorbed but if they\u2019re aware of SILs ND then I\u2019d say OP is the AH.", "The issue is that when SIL is actually on the spectrum but not diagnosed (very common for women) and never had therapy, she never really learned to deal with it so her behaviour becomes socially accepted.", "(I would also note that I feel it's silly to get on OP's case for being blunt, when they are responding to SIL, who seems to have a history of being very blunt.)\n\nEchoing others (and as I've commented at length in other threads): if SIL has no idea that she might be on the spectrum, and if those around her do not (her husband, etc.), then it's definitely harder for her to deal with.  AFAB people who are not diagnosed until well into adulthood spend years making do and just thinking \"oh, I'm just weird\" (and regarding somethings, \"Oh, I'm flawed, oh, I'm a fuck-up -- how can I mask this and seem normal? how can I manage this and not have people think I'm terrible?\" etc.).\n\nI mean, you're exactly right -- being on the spectrum doesn't give her license to be rude, or monopolize a conversation, etc.  But if she and others knew that these behaviors were due to being on the spectrum, other people, like her husband or others in the family, could help her deal with it when it arises.  (And she could get therapy for ways to recognize when she's doing it and strategies for avoiding it.)", "Yes but they need to know to learn what people consider rude. She might not be insulted by such a comment and therefore can't see why others are.\n\nDoes SIL know and is / was in therapy?", "Is anyone actually saying that ND people \\*can't\\* be rude?  I don't think most of us are.\n\nOf course what SIL is described as doing here is rude.  (Or potentially rude, with regard to demanding that everyone follow a very strict schedule or else it will cause a meltdown.)\n\nBringing up neurodivergence is a potential \\*explanation\\*, and if it turned out to be true, it might enable SIL and others around her to find ways to mitigate these rude behaviors.\n\nAs with so many things, you can't fix a problem if you don't understand that it's a problem in the first place.  That is where SIL is right now.\n\n(I mean, as described, it's shocking that nobody has suggested she check out the possibility before this.  But, it's really easy for us to sit here and read a short summary of observations, separated from the distraction of being there and knowing the person and so on, and say \"hey that sounds like...\"  It \\*is\\* surprising how often ND behaviors are explained-away, or just how often family members refuse to consider it might be a factor, because they have some picture of what neurodivergence looks like in their head, and this person \"doesn't seem that way\".)", "I think in general we judge whether someone is an AH partially by how easy or difficult something may be for them, and for certain tasks that differs greatly for ND people.  And in this case specifically, is the other party even aware they made a mistake? Usually we don't consider making a mistake to be an AH behavior, unless it was negligent, but depending where SIL falls on the social difficulties part of ASD she could have been completely unaware.", "If you made the plan you want to stick to it. I get it, its hard being the one that makes all the plans. I don't think people realize the work that goes into it. Its very easy to be the person that just goes along with the plan.", "But, you know that your child is autistic, and thus you are raising him with this in mind.\n\nThere's a good chance that SIL has made it into adulthood having no idea that she is ND, and was never tested or diagnosed.\n\nIt's easy for us to read a short summary of behaviors like this, without the messy factor of dealing with a person in real life and knowing them, and saying \"ah! that all sounds like...\"  It's a lot more common for people to brush off or explain away these behaviors, because they think they know what neurodivergency looks like, and they don't think this person fits that preconceived notion.  (That goes for both SIL, and people around her: her family, teachers, her husband, her husband's family, etc.)\n\nYes, absolutely -- ND or not, SIL is being rude.  \n\nFinding out if she is ND or not would only be a way to make more constructive suggestions for how she can figure out ways (probably with her husband's and family's help) to become better at being not-rude.", "And to be honest 30 minutes of dinosaur facts sounds a lot more interesting than \u201cit\u2019s cool how electric cars can run without gas\u201d", "What's your favourite dinosaur?", "Ross?", "SIL might very well not have considered it or know it about herself.  AFAB people are notoriously under-diagnosed when it comes to these things, and sometimes don't get a diagnosis until later in life, after they've read some articles and said \"heyyyyyy\".  (I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was over 50.)\n\nIt could also be that she does know  and so does her husband, but they don't want to openly tell the rest of the family.  (OP feels like an unsympathetic listener, so that might be a reason they wouldn't have been told; although perhaps I do OP a disservice, maybe they'd be more sympathetic if they knew this was the case.)\n\nI mean, here we are, all internet strangers, and of course I hesitate to diagnose someone based on some anecdotes from somebody else.  But, yeah, all of those anecdotes fit a recognizable pattern.\n\nSomeone who doesn't know the root of these behaviors could have a hard time coming up with ways to mitigate them / manage them.  (A lot of people with undiagnosed conditions DO come up with strategies or ways to mask them, but it's still a huge lightbulb moment when you realize it's all linked together.)", "I was reading this like 'hmmm, that could be me!'", "That\u2019s when I have *second breakfast*\n\nI have the first one when I get up.  Then I have the other one with everyone else and I\u2019m no longer anxious or stressed about when because I\u2019ve already been fed.\n\nI\u2019ve figured myself out well enough to know some anxiety defeating tricks!", "I'm with you. If we're having breakfast. We're having breakfast- I need to schedule my day. That said- I will just go about my morning without everyone else and plan my vacations accordingly. If I'm up at 8am, I'm not waiting to have breakfast when you get up at 11.", "Oh, definitely not.  There would be ways to manage, or come up with strategies to manage, each of the things described here, if SIL and others knew that she was on the spectrum (or had ADHD; but this sounds like more than ADHD).  And if she and others knew, and she just wasn't bothering to try to learn ways not to be rude, I'd judge her differently for that.\n\nBut right now we're left wondering if SIL knows this about herself at all, or has even suspected.  A lot of neurodivergent AFAB people aren't diagnosed early.  Many are finally diagnosed in adulthood (I was over 50 when diagnosed with ADHD).  Up until then, a lot of people think that they're \"just weird\", or in some cases they're flawed or broken in some way and come up with masking techniques to try to hide it.\n\nUltimately, though, you have to know what the problem is, or even that you have a problem, in order to really successfully address it.    \n\nThe interactions described here are definitely rude on SIL's part.  Getting testing and getting a diagnosis might lead her to therapy, and learning ways to mitigate the behaviors described here. \n\nUnfortunately, given the bad blood described here, it kind of sounds like OP is not going to be the right person to gently suggest that SIL might be on the spectrum and might benefit from testing.  OP's best bet would be to talk to her brother and give him a hint; or even just show him this post.", "I had the same question -- I really, REALLY want to know OP's age here!  It's a little telling that they don't note it.  (I wonder if they just didn't think to; but it comes off as them thinking that it would make them look bad.  They ARE acting like a kid under 17, rather than an adult.  Or at least they sound like it in this post.)", "Same for me. \n\nI have ADHD and not having a plan and a schedule would drive me batty IF I was expected to be doing things with the group. \n\nLike if it\u2019s no big deal that I have breakfast when I want and I don\u2019t have to be ready to go anywhere? No worries. But having it all up in the air would make me anxious. \n\nAs for the fat comments and dinosaur stuff, I don\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s and have more social clue than to do that.", "agreed on the therapy points, and that those around can help deal with it - i think her husband already is, considering that he took SIL aside after the weight comments. hence why i think that part of helping SIL navigate these situations is having another party tell her when her enthusiasm needs to be checked after she'd had her turn to express it.", "Exactly!  And a lot of AFAB people spend a lot of years feeling different in a bad way, and trying to cope but not knowing how to do so successfully (or, trying to cope but falling right back into the behavior), until they are diagnosed and it all fits together.\n\nThe way I see what's described here, for example: if SIL \\*was\\* ND, and knew it, and her husband knew it, and perhaps others in the family knew it, then they could come up with more successful ways to help her deal with schedule anxiety, or help her recognize when she is dominating a gathering by talking and not allowing others a chance to talk.  (And, helping her in a way that doesn't blame her for the behavior, when it's initially not coming from an intention to be rude.)", "Yeah, people 100% love to use speculative neurodivergence to excuse inexcusable behaviour... needing routine, being blunt, and being excited about dinosaurs are not things I think are actually terrible traits.\n\nOP seems to dislike SIL way more than warranted.\n\nAlso definitely not the slightest bit autistic, and \"we just do stuff whenever people get up\" would drive me insane. I would not attempt to holiday with people who roll like that.", "I want SIL to come to my family Christmas, it tends to be boring", "Totally agree! I was diagnosed at 36 and even now I\u2019m discovering things I thought were \u201cnormal\u201d that apparently aren\u2019t!

We just gravitated together without really knowing why so we\u2019d be there reassuring each other we were fine when in reality our \u201cfine\u201d was not the \u201cfine\u201d neurotypical people experience!", "Loving this Hobbity life hack!", "Definitely sounds like it and it says my vote.

Niiiccceeee.", "Yes, but you know and you probably had some sort of behaviour therapy. If SIL doesn't know, she might not have learned it since she doesn't even know why she acts like she does and why people are acting the way they do.\n\nAlso, some things, she can't change. She might not even consider what she said to be mean but wanted to engage in conversation. This is not specific to \"neurodivergent\" people. This is also true for different cultures having different ideas of \"rude\" except that neurodivergent people don't always comply to their own culture either.", "And these sound like some top notch facts as well\n\nI knew that dinosaurs and oil were related somehow, but SIL seems to have some serious knowledge\n\nI\u2019m not saying I know much more about Electric vehicles vs. ICE than OP, but SIL sure as hell knows a lot more about dinosaurs than he does cars", "I think it was a rude thing to say and social norms would say not to make those kinds of comments. And I even agree that\u2019s how it should be because comments like that are hurtful (even when they aren\u2019t intended to).\n\nThat being said\u2026 Its pretty equally weird to feel like \u201cOP never asked for her input\u201d when OP is the one who brought it up with her? Again, she shouldn\u2019t have made that comment at all. But bringing something up with someone means opening the conversation up to their input. If you don\u2019t want someone\u2019s input on something, don\u2019t bring it up with them.\n\nIt\u2019s not about whether OP asked for input or not.

But also OP did kind of create a social trap and get his feelings hurt when she walked into it. \n\n\n\n\nLike I want to point out that a factual observation in response to a topic that somebody else brings up is perfectly appropriate in most circumstances. \"I have to save up for a trip to Hawaii this spring\" \"yeah, I hear it's expensive\". No biggie. The faux pas is that people get very touchy about weight. \n\n\nIt sounds like OP would have been more comfortable if SIL had responded by reassuring him he is a skinny legend or commisserating about her own body struggles or something, but either of those might require her to lie if he is gaining weight or if she doesn't have those struggles, so there are contradictory social rules at play. At the end of the day if OP didn't want people to walk through that conversational door he didn't have to open it.", "Be that as it may, it's still not an invitation to a conversation about weight.... this is basic etiquette.", "Hence the questions about her being neurodivergent.  Because this is one of those instances where 'basic etiquette' makes no sense at all for ND people - he made a statement, and she shared her confirming observations - without being judgy, at least as OP presented, I want to point out.    \n\n\nTacit rules about what does/doesn't or should/shouldn't happen are allistic territory.  Dominant groups enforcing norms on non-dominant groups is sh\\*++y and dictatorial. Maybe accommodate neurodivergence, rather than call it ignorant, rude, or incompetent.", "The only reason that is etiquette is because of social norms / judgements around weight, which ASD individuals might be unaware of / bad at seeing how they come into play. If OP was saying her eyes were looking pretty green today, and SIL said something like \"Yeah, they're looking emerald,\" it's just as unsolicited, but a more socially acceptable pattern of conversation. To an ASD individual, \"You've put on weight.\" could very well just be a neutral statement, and the conversation was opened by OP.", "Nobody called neurodivergence ANY of those things. If you go back to my original comment, you'll actually see that I was agreeing that she probably IS ND given that she doesn't really grasp social taboos. Me agreeing with someone's premise does nit equate to me bashing ND people. \n\nAlso, you seem INCREDIBLY triggered by this, amd I assume that's why you jumped to conclusions that were blatantly wrong."]}
