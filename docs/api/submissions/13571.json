I\u2019ve never been a big surprise/party person, I like to celebrate my birthday by usually doing something a bit quieter that I know I\u2019ll really enjoy. In light of this, I bought tickets for this Friday to see my favorite band. Bought them almost a full year ago. When I say favorite band, I mean #1 played artist on my Spotify for the past 5 years, cry to in the shower, know the lyrics to every song favorite band. But I\u2019ve never seen them live! And I\u2019ve had a year to plan. Even got myself a cute little concert outfit.\n\nSkip to three weeks ago, I mentioned something to my flatmate about how excited I am for the 31st & long story short she spills the beans that my friend planned/paid for \u201csomething\u201d for that day, and said I should cancel my plans. \n\nThe first issue here is, I\u2019m worried what they have planned. The friend who apparently \u201cpaid for\u201d this \u201csurprise birthday thing\u201d is big into getting tables at these London clubs, and that\u2019s very sweet but I\u2019m just not that kind of girl. And I was waiting for a year for this concert. When I expressed my concerns (just politely saying that I wished someone had asked if I was free) I was met with a surprising lack of sympathy, and again told to cancel \u201cwhatever I had going on.\u201d\n\nThe second issue\u2026 because I still did want to do something (small) with my friends for my birthday, I made dinner reservations weeks ago for the day after the concert (Saturday). I told them all and they all said they were looking forward to it. And I mentioned it more than once, even talked to one of them about it two days ago. I found out today that all three of them made plans without me for Saturday. They\u2019re going to a game together. Everyone forgot about the dinner, no one invited me. \n\nNo one\u2019s doing anything tonight for me either. Not that I needed anything\u2026 but, you know, who wants to spend their 25th birthday alone?\n\nI\u2019d really rather go to the concert and say screw them.
