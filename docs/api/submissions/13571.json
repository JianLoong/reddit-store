I\u2019ve never been a big surprise/party person, I like to celebrate my birthday by usually doing something a bit quieter that I know I\u2019ll really enjoy. In light of this, I bought tickets for this Friday to see my favorite band. Bought them almost a full year ago. When I say favorite band, I mean #1 played artist on my Spotify for the past 5 years, cry to in the shower, know the lyrics to every song favorite band. But I\u2019ve never seen them live! And I\u2019ve had a year to plan. Even got myself a cute little concert outfit.\n\nSkip to three weeks ago, I mentioned something to my flatmate about how excited I am for the 31st & long story short she spills the beans that my friend planned/paid for \u201csomething\u201d for that day, and said I should cancel my plans. \n\nThe first issue here is, I\u2019m worried what they have planned. The friend who apparently \u201cpaid for\u201d this \u201csurprise birthday thing\u201d is big into getting tables at these London clubs, and that\u2019s very sweet but I\u2019m just not that kind of girl. And I was waiting for a year for this concert. When I expressed my concerns (just politely saying that I wished someone had asked if I was free) I was met with a surprising lack of sympathy, and again told to cancel \u201cwhatever I had going on.\u201d\n\nThe second issue\u2026 because I still did want to do something (small) with my friends for my birthday, I made dinner reservations weeks ago for the day after the concert (Saturday). I told them all and they all said they were looking forward to it. And I mentioned it more than once, even talked to one of them about it two days ago. I found out today that all three of them made plans without me for Saturday. They\u2019re going to a game together. Everyone forgot about the dinner, no one invited me. \n\nNo one\u2019s doing anything tonight for me either. Not that I needed anything\u2026 but, you know, who wants to spend their 25th birthday alone?\n\nI\u2019d really rather go to the concert and say screw them.

Honestly, sounds like whatever was planned was more for them than you anyway.", "NTA. \n\nYou stated that you bought the tickets almost a year prior so obviously you were going to be busy and knew that a YEAR in advance and your friends most likely knew too. \n\nThey can\u2019t just expect you to cancel something you\u2019ve had planned for so long and have been wanting for however long as well. \n\nEnjoy the concert!", "NTA. Their failure to check on your availability is not your problem. With what concert tickets cost right now, I wouldn't be missing a show unless I, or someone in my family, was in the hospital. Most important - IT'S YOUR FAVORITE BAND! Go to your concert, buy a t-shirt, and have a wonderful time!", "Just a crazy thought, your friend seems so sure of themselves, is it possible your surprise party is all of you going to the concert?\n\nI'd find out first before dropping any bombs. If it is you have a ticket to scalp on the night. If not ditch them and go to the gig.\n\nNTA.", "Happy birthday and NTA. I'm not a big surprise/party person either, can't imagine carefully planning certain things and having people just...disregard all that to do something I wouldn't even like.\n\nDefinitely go to the concert, and enjoy the hell out of it.

Have fun at your concert...", "The only excuse for your friends acting like this is if they bought you tickets to THE concert you wanted to go to, not knowing you already had, and were trying to get you to sell them to recoup your costs. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only valid reason. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine throwing a surprise party for someone who hasn\u2019t explicitly expressed the desire for such a thing.

I didn\u2019t really want to go because my roomie and I weren\u2019t that close (but happened to share a bff) We ubered home when it was almost dark and when they went to unlock the door I grabbed their hand and tried to pull them out of the doorway because I saw a shadow move inside our house through a curtained window. \n\nI literally had 911 up on my phone in seconds ready to hit send and by that time she reached with her other hand to open it and people were all \u201csurprise!\u201d \n\nI had to sit in my room in the dark for 10 minutes because the roomie- and at least 3 guests- knew about past trauma that directly relates to that \u201cpeople hiding in my dark house\u201d scenario- and STILL thought it was a good idea to get me hammered and have people hiding in the dark in my house.\n\nSome people are just fucking stupid. \n\nI learned that day to never spend my birthday doing anything other than exactly what I wanted and I hope my story is lesson enough for you!!

Play into the surprise.", "NTA\n\nOP their gift wasn't for you...they just planned for it to be on your birthday.\n\nAlso, they didn't forget the dinner that you made to be with them...because they made sure not to include you in their new plans.\n\nGo to your concert.\n\nWhen they complain,  point out that hey told you to go when they ditched you on purpose", "NTA, but you might want to leave early for the concert so you can avoid them and get to the concert on time.

They\u2019re throwing themself a party with you as the excuse. \n\nGhost them and see who misses you there to see who your actual friends are. \n\nHave fun at the concert!", "NTA. This is the problem with doing surprise events or surprises in general. And it is wrong of them to expect you to cancel your plans, that you've had for a freakin' year, to do something you'd hate.", "NTA. Please tell me you'll go to the concert!\nI would be raging too, after this. They are ignorant of your plans/feelings.", "NTA.

Enjoy your concert!!!", "No enjoy the concert. They can't get angry. You (officially) didn't know they'd planned a party. Presumably they may have known about the concert.   You waited a year.

Who knew last year that id be finally going to xxx concert for my bday weekend this year! And on top of that the gang is getting together for celebretory food saturday!

Or take friend(s) who didn\u2019t ditch you", "This is the way", "Agree", "My idea of a good birthday party is dinner at home with family with cake and ice cream for dessert.", "No, it most definitely is not.  If it was, most surprise parties would fail, since most people do indeed have other plans.\n\nWhen you plan a surprise party, you are supposed to make FAKE plans for the honoree.  Tell them you are cooking dinner for them at your house, and when they arrive, surprise, 100 of their closest friends are there.", "A surprise party is only as good as the friendship between the host and the honoree. \n\nA good friend knows things like \"this person hates big parties,\" and respects the honoree enough to let their preferences be the guide, so they plan a surprise small dinner party with a few friends. The honoree doesn't like surprises or parties? The good friend will include them in the planning and be fine with having no party at all. And some people love surprises and parties (like me! I always wished someone would throw me one, but no dice), and everything works out.\n\nThe problem comes when the hosts aren't good friends to the honoree. Either they aren't aware of someone's preferences or - usually more likely - decide that they know better. \"He only *thinks* he doesn't like big parties!\" \"She's said she's an introvert but we can change that!\" Those are bad friends who don't respect the honoree's decisions, and that will make for a disappointment at the absolute *best*.", "Graduations are boring af to everyone but maybe your parents.", "My mom fell asleep at mine"]}
