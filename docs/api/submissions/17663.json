{"id": 17663, "submission_id": "13lzwnu", "title": "AITA for not helping my neighbor with her kids after her husband left her", "selftext": "Background info: My husband and I (late 20s M&F), have lived next to Jack and Jill for two years. We have a son who\u2019s six years old, and they have two kids who are a similar age, but a little bit older. All the kids go to the same elementary school and I used to see Jack in the car rider line. Our neighborhood is relatively close to the school so the school bus does not pick up here, we have to walk or drive our kids to school. \n\nJack and Jill have constantly had loud fights ever since they moved here. And by fights I mostly mean Jill would scream at jack and kick him out the house on a weekly basis. Normally he would sleep in his car and come back inside in the morning after she leaves for work. Jill works as a CNA at a nearby hospital, the 6am-6pm shift. Jack worked from home, like I do, which let him take the kids to school. \n\nWell, after this last fight jack packed up all his stuff and left, flew back home to his mother in a different country. Jill recently came to me saying that she has no one to watch her kids from roughly 5 am to 7 pm. \n\nShe asked if she could send them over in the morning, have me watch them and feed them breakfast and then take them to school. And then later pick them up and feed them dinner and watch them till she gets off work. I explained to her that being expected to be a second parent basically to two kids is not something I\u2019m really interested in. I asked how much she was willing to pay and she said she EXPECTED me to do it for free, since she has no friends and no one else to ask. She also asked if I would watch them on the weekends so she could pick up extra shifts, otherwise she won\u2019t be able to pay the rent. \n\nI told her absolutely not, and that she\u2019s insane basically to think I\u2019d agree to something so unreasonable when we aren\u2019t even friends and our kids aren\u2019t friends either. \n\nMy husband thinks I was an asshole, and that we could offer to at least help sometimes for the kids sake. My stance is that we both know she wouldn\u2019t do the same for us if the roles were reversed, since Jill isn\u2019t really a nice person. \n\nAITA for not helping my neighbor with her kids after her husband left?", "created_utc": 1684512512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lzwnu/aita_for_not_helping_my_neighbor_with_her_kids/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not even her asking you for help, it's her expecting you to pick up her slack.\n\n* 5a-7a Monday-Friday (with breakfast and transportation)\n* 3p-7p Monday-Friday (with snack, dinner, and transportation)\n* weekends as needed\n\nAnd let's not forget, it's about time for summer break.  So you'd what, have to provide full daycare while she works?\n\nShe needs to come up with a plan on her own that does not involve forcing neighbors to parent her children.", "NTA.\n\nIt's empathetic that Jill is in a tough spot, but it's not fair or reasonable for her to ask you to become an unpaid, full-time caretaker for her children. That's a huge commitment that involves a lot of time, effort, and resources, and it's completely out of the norm for what you'd ask of a neighbor, particularly one you don't even consider a friend.\n\nIt's clear you would have been willing to discuss some form of compensation, but Jill expecting you to do it for free is out of line. Your husband is right that it's sad for the kids, but it's not your obligation to pick up the slack. Jill needs to find other arrangements or support systems to help with her children.\n\nMoreover, your assessment of Jill's behavior from what you've seen also plays into your decision, which is understandable. You've observed her being disrespectful and aggressive in her relationship with Jack, which could reasonably make you cautious about getting more involved with her family. In short, your decision is justified. You're not the asshole for setting boundaries and maintaining them.", "NTA. Your husband needs to back off. You are not responsible for watching Jill's children. She needs to arrange for a family member or get a nanny. This is her problem, not yours.", "NTA. This is way too big of an ask and is not even a fix for her--if she can't afford rent absent Jack's income, she needs to start looking for a new place now, meaning you won't be her neighbor for long.", "Nope nta. Do not budge. The husband needs to come back and step up. Tell your husband to look after the kids", "NTA. You were spot on, that\u2019s an insane request!!", "NTA. Hell...the husband left the country to get away from her.", "NTA - She's got a lot of nerve asking for that!", "NTA\n\nHelping out on an occasional basis is one thing. But *every day*? Plus weekends? Insane. \n\nShe should have considered this result when she was kicking her husband out time and again.", "NTA.  That's tough to watch children suffer for their parents' bad behaviors.  That said, in what universe would someone expect an almost stranger to assume responsibility for their children?  You clearly needed to set boundaries.  \n\nI appreciate your husband's compassion for the children, but am disappointed that he did not seem to support you as I think he should have.  You are not a bad person for not allowing this stranger to impose on you for what looks like a potentially long time, both with your time and effort and your money (since you would need to feed her children with no compensation).  She may be in a bind, but looks like she got there on her own and needs to make some adjustments in her life as a single parent.  \n\nYou were right in not allowing this lady to impose on you and your family.", "Nta\n\nBut isn't that so nice of your husband to volunteer *himself* to do all that though lol.", "NTA.... Stay far away from this women.\n\nThe audacity... The entitlement is mind boggling.\n\nYou can offer help as in being over a meatloaf here and there so the got something to eat. NOT fulltime free babysitting for her kids... She'll latch on and never let go.", "NTA. She can't just shove her responsibilities on you. Your husband is wrong. If you help her at all it will become raising her kids as she wants you to have them all day every day", "NTA. Why would your husband want you to? This is a lot to take on and would be relevant only if your kids were friends. Don\u2019t budge!", "NTA\n\nGuess you're finding out now why such a demanding, bullying woman is getting divorced.", "NTA, and I think that all of the reasons why are in the OP\u2019s post. \n\nFirst, OP states that was Jill would scream at Jack and throw him out of the house. With Jack gone, who will Jill now turn her frustrations onto in her ever increasingly difficult situation as money becomes more scarce?\n\nSecond, Jill has **no friends.** Why do we suppose that is? Young couple with younger kids in school, who doesn\u2019t have at least some friends? Could it be that they\u2019ve been alienated for some reason? Did you want to find out and join their club? \n\nAnd let\u2019s not even get started on the whole \u201cfor free\u201d aspect of her whole proposal. **WITH FOOD!** You know that this will also include transportation to the beach, park, zoo, museum, take your pick, and the price of admission and food as well. \n\nYour husband may have a good heart,  I get that. But then again, I presume that the bulk of the work falls upon OP, and perhaps he hasn\u2019t fully thought thru the financial implications. \n\nBut especially if you believe that Jill wouldn\u2019t do it for you, no, just no. \ud83d\ude15", "NTA, if you wanted you could help, but neither would i. And i think you're afraid if you give the finger, she takes the whole hand. Stay abstain.", "NTA. As you said it yourself, you have no obligation at all to be a \"second parent\" to her kids. And the favor she asked for is really abusive to be honest. If you and your husband were, like, best friends with Jack and Jill, maaaaybe the scenario could be a little different (or not!). But since you guys are not even friends with them, you were totally sensible.", "NTA not, not one little bit. You handled it well", "Not your pig, not your farm.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe someone would even ask that of someone else, let alone for free! You didn\u2019t make those babies, I wouldn\u2019t even feel bad about telling her to fuck off.", "nta", "NTA. If she can't handle the kids she should agree with her husband about the time he will have the kids. Or she has to pay for a sitter. But no, you don't have to look after their children. Especially not if she thinks you should do it for free and every day and also on weekends. Just no. Not your children, not your problem", "NTA\nHelping is one thing, working for free is another, especially when it involves responsibility and commitment to schedules.", "NTA you will definitely be used. This is her responsibility and she needs to figure it out.", "NTA. Sounds like she created the situation she's in on her own. It's not your responsibility to bail her out of it. Especially not for free!\n\nAnd if your husband thinks you should offer to help, let him offer and provide the help himself!", "NTA\u2026you\u2019re not Jill\u2019s nanny nor are you obligated to watch her kids.  She needs to figure that out on her own and stop acting so entitled.  Let her find a babysitter or a family member to help her.  How dare she expect you to do this.  As for your husband, if he thinks your an AH maybe he can try watching these kids without any help from you.", "NTA - It sounds insensitive when you say \"I wont help this mom whose husband just left her\". BUT what she is asking is so unreasonable it's not even funny. She is legit asking you to take care of her kids all but a few hours in the day. EVERY SINGLE DAY. Shoot, it is hard to be a parent in that same time span.  \n\nSounds like this lady is in a bad spot but what I always remember is it is not my fault she is in a bad spot and I am not the only one in the world who can help. I may even be the least best person to help.  \n\nSucks for her and her kids but that is life sometimes. Have to rethink how to go about things, downsize, find a babysitter, whatever.", "<My husband thinks I was an asshole, and that we could offer to at least help sometimes for the kids sake.>\n\nThen let HIM do it!\n\nNTA!!", "NTA", "Nope don\u2019t get involved in this mess. \n\nThe entitlement of your time is insane. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Good for you for standing your ground.  She has no friends? Color me shocked.\n\nAnd please make sure you aren't voluntold by hubby.", "NTA. That is suck a huge ask and on top of it, not get paid? \n\nIf your husband disagrees then tell him he\u2019s more than welcome to buy/cook extra meals, get them to/from school, and give up his weekends to watch them. \n\nCause you know everything would fall onto you if this was to happen. Stay strong!", "Shoot I forgot about summer break! yeah nope on that one", "Absolutely **do not** tell your husband any such thing! You of course know who will end up watching those kids. \ud83d\ude23", "OP's husband does not need to be on daddy duty for the neighbor's kids.  That leads to husband duty and No one needs that, except maybe the neighbor.", "Yeah basically if you want to do it you might as well adopt them!"]}
