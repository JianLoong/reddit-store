{"id": 17663, "submission_id": "13lzwnu", "title": "AITA for not helping my neighbor with her kids after her husband left her", "selftext": "Background info: My husband and I (late 20s M&F), have lived next to Jack and Jill for two years. We have a son who\u2019s six years old, and they have two kids who are a similar age, but a little bit older. All the kids go to the same elementary school and I used to see Jack in the car rider line. Our neighborhood is relatively close to the school so the school bus does not pick up here, we have to walk or drive our kids to school. \n\nJack and Jill have constantly had loud fights ever since they moved here. And by fights I mostly mean Jill would scream at jack and kick him out the house on a weekly basis. Normally he would sleep in his car and come back inside in the morning after she leaves for work. Jill works as a CNA at a nearby hospital, the 6am-6pm shift. Jack worked from home, like I do, which let him take the kids to school. \n\nWell, after this last fight jack packed up all his stuff and left, flew back home to his mother in a different country. Jill recently came to me saying that she has no one to watch her kids from roughly 5 am to 7 pm. \n\nShe asked if she could send them over in the morning, have me watch them and feed them breakfast and then take them to school. And then later pick them up and feed them dinner and watch them till she gets off work. I explained to her that being expected to be a second parent basically to two kids is not something I\u2019m really interested in. I asked how much she was willing to pay and she said she EXPECTED me to do it for free, since she has no friends and no one else to ask. She also asked if I would watch them on the weekends so she could pick up extra shifts, otherwise she won\u2019t be able to pay the rent. \n\nI told her absolutely not, and that she\u2019s insane basically to think I\u2019d agree to something so unreasonable when we aren\u2019t even friends and our kids aren\u2019t friends either. \n\nMy husband thinks I was an asshole, and that we could offer to at least help sometimes for the kids sake. My stance is that we both know she wouldn\u2019t do the same for us if the roles were reversed, since Jill isn\u2019t really a nice person. \n\nAITA for not helping my neighbor with her kids after her husband left?", "created_utc": 1684512512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lzwnu/aita_for_not_helping_my_neighbor_with_her_kids/", "score": 5315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not even her asking you for help, it's her expecting you to pick up her slack.\n\n* 5a-7a Monday-Friday (with breakfast and transportation)\n* 3p-7p Monday-Friday (with snack, dinner, and transportation)\n* weekends as needed\n\nAnd let's not forget, it's about time for summer break.  So you'd what, have to provide full daycare while she works?\n\nShe needs to come up with a plan on her own that does not involve forcing neighbors to parent her children.", "NTA.\n\nIt's empathetic that Jill is in a tough spot, but it's not fair or reasonable for her to ask you to become an unpaid, full-time caretaker for her children. That's a huge commitment that involves a lot of time, effort, and resources, and it's completely out of the norm for what you'd ask of a neighbor, particularly one you don't even consider a friend.\n\nIt's clear you would have been willing to discuss some form of compensation, but Jill expecting you to do it for free is out of line. Your husband is right that it's sad for the kids, but it's not your obligation to pick up the slack. Jill needs to find other arrangements or support systems to help with her children.\n\nMoreover, your assessment of Jill's behavior from what you've seen also plays into your decision, which is understandable. You've observed her being disrespectful and aggressive in her relationship with Jack, which could reasonably make you cautious about getting more involved with her family. In short, your decision is justified. You're not the asshole for setting boundaries and maintaining them.", "NTA. Your husband needs to back off. You are not responsible for watching Jill's children. She needs to arrange for a family member or get a nanny to watch her kids. This is her problem, not yours.", "NTA. This is way too big of an ask and is not even a fix for her--if she can't afford rent absent Jack's income, she needs to start looking for a new place now, meaning you won't be her neighbor for long.", "Nope nta. Do not budge. The husband needs to come back and step up. Tell your husband to look after the kids", "NTA. You were spot on, that\u2019s an insane request!!", "NTA. Hell...the husband left the country to get away from her.", "NTA - She's got a lot of nerve asking for that!", "NTA\n\nHelping out on an occasional basis is one thing. But *every day*? Plus weekends? Insane. \n\nShe should have considered this result when she was kicking her husband out time and again.", "NTA.  That's tough to watch children suffer for their parents' bad behaviors.  That said, in what universe would someone expect an almost stranger to assume responsibility for their children?  You clearly needed to set boundaries.  \n\nI appreciate your husband's compassion for the children, but am disappointed that he did not seem to support you as I think he should have.  You are not a bad person for not allowing this stranger to impose on you for what looks like a potentially long time, both with your time and effort and your money (since you would need to feed her children with no compensation).  She may be in a bind, but looks like she got there on her own and needs to make some adjustments in her life as a single parent.  \n\nYou were right in not allowing this lady to impose on you and your family.", "Nta\n\nBut isn't that so nice of your husband to volunteer *himself* to do all that though lol.", "NTA.... Stay far away from this women.\n\nThe audacity... The entitlement is mind boggling.\n\nYou can offer help as in being over a meatloaf here and there so the got something to eat. NOT fulltime free babysitting for her kids... She'll latch on and never let go.", "NTA. She can't just shove her responsibilities on you. Your husband is wrong. If you help her at all it will become raising her kids as she wants you to have them all day every day", "NTA. Why would your husband want you to? This is a lot to take on and would be relevant only if your kids were friends. Don\u2019t budge!", "NTA\n\nGuess you're finding out now why such a demanding, bullying woman is getting divorced.", "NTA, and I think that all of the reasons why are in the OP\u2019s post. \n\nFirst, OP states that was Jill would scream at Jack and throw him out of the house. With Jack gone, who will Jill now turn her frustrations onto in her ever increasingly difficult situation as money becomes more scarce?\n\nSecond, Jill has **no friends.** Why do we suppose that is? Young couple with younger kids in school, who doesn\u2019t have at least some friends? Could it be that they\u2019ve been alienated for some reason? Did you want to find out and join their club? \n\nAnd let\u2019s not even get started on the whole \u201cfor free\u201d aspect of her whole proposal. **WITH FOOD!** You know that this will also include transportation to the beach, park, zoo, museum, take your pick, and the price of admission and food as well. \n\nYour husband may have a good heart,  I get that. But then again, I presume that the bulk of the work falls upon OP, and perhaps he hasn\u2019t fully thought thru the financial implications. \n\nBut especially if you believe that Jill wouldn\u2019t do it for you, no, just no. \ud83d\ude15", "NTA, if you wanted you could help, but neither would i. And i think you're afraid if you give the finger, she takes the whole hand. Stay abstain.", "NTA. As you said it yourself, you have no obligation at all to be a \"second parent\" to her kids. And the favor she asked for is really abusive to be honest. If you and your husband were, like, best friends with Jack and Jill, maaaaybe the scenario could be a little different (or not!). But since you guys are not even friends with them, you were totally sensible.", "NTA not, not one little bit. You handled it well", "Not your pig, not your farm.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe someone would even ask that of someone else, let alone for free! You didn\u2019t make those babies, I wouldn\u2019t even feel bad about telling her to fuck off.", "nta", "NTA. If she can't handle the kids she should agree with her husband about the time he will have the kids. Or she has to pay for a sitter. But no, you don't have to look after their children. Especially not if she thinks you should do it for free and every day and also on weekends. Just no. Not your children, not your problem", "NTA\nHelping is one thing, working for free is another, especially when it involves responsibility and commitment to schedules.", "NTA you will definitely be used. This is her responsibility and she needs to figure it out.", "NTA. Sounds like she created the situation she's in on her own. It's not your responsibility to bail her out of it. Especially not for free!\n\nAnd if your husband thinks you should offer to help, let him offer and provide the help himself!", "NTA\u2026you\u2019re not Jill\u2019s nanny nor are you obligated to watch her kids.  She needs to figure that out on her own and stop acting so entitled.  Let her find a babysitter or a family member to help her.  How dare she expect you to do this.  As for your husband, if he thinks your an AH maybe he can try watching these kids without any help from you.", "NTA - It sounds insensitive when you say \"I wont help this mom whose husband just left her\". BUT what she is asking is so unreasonable it's not even funny. She is legit asking you to take care of her kids all but a few hours in the day. EVERY SINGLE DAY. Shoot, it is hard to be a parent in that same time span.  \n\nSounds like this lady is in a bad spot but what I always remember is it is not my fault she is in a bad spot and I am not the only one in the world who can help. I may even be the least best person to help.  \n\nSucks for her and her kids but that is life sometimes. Have to rethink how to go about things, downsize, find a babysitter, whatever.", "<My husband thinks I was an asshole, and that we could offer to at least help sometimes for the kids sake.>\n\nThen let HIM do it!\n\nNTA!!", "NTA", "Nope don\u2019t get involved in this mess. \n\nThe entitlement of your time is insane. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Good for you for standing your ground.  She has no friends? Color me shocked.\n\nAnd please make sure you aren't voluntold by hubby.", "NTA. That is suck a huge ask and on top of it, not get paid? \n\nIf your husband disagrees then tell him he\u2019s more than welcome to buy/cook extra meals, get them to/from school, and give up his weekends to watch them. \n\nCause you know everything would fall onto you if this was to happen. Stay strong!", "Shoot I forgot about summer break! yeah nope on that one", "Absolutely **do not** tell your husband any such thing! You of course know who will end up watching those kids. \ud83d\ude23", "OP's husband does not need to be on daddy duty for the neighbor's kids.  That leads to husband duty and No one needs that, except maybe the neighbor.", "Yeah basically if you want to do it you might as well adopt them!", "Who did your husband mean by \"we\"? He's so jovial about it, it doesn't sound like he included himself and his time - or at least has no idea what it would mean to him.\n\nI mean, he can offer it to her but that would be HIS responsibility alone. I think he'd talk differently then", ">My husband thinks I was an asshole\n\nWhat? Why? Does he understand what she's asking? The kids would basically move in with you. Wtf. No.", "I'm getting an idea of why the husband might have left...", "Think of all the days that the kids won't have school. Like all summer and holidays.  Mom is a CNA so I doubt she gets holidays off. So you'd be watching the kids all day at those times.\n\nEven if school was in session, this is still a big NO.", "NTA - Do you know how much parents PAY for the kind of service she is asking of you? Hell and Nah.", "NTA.  You just described a full-time parent.  Money is not even the issue here.  Taking on two kids to raise is insane.  She's a single parent now and has to figure it out and expecting neighbors to just take on the parenting of her kids is NOT the way to go.", "NO. This is absolutely a \u201cgive an inch take a mile\u201d kind of person. Do not help out \u201csometimes.\u201d NTA.", "Not your kids, not your responsibility. I guarantee you will be expected to feed them, and since she's not paying you, it will cost YOU money and time to watch her kids for her.

Why on earth would you raise her kids??", "NTA.\n\nYour neighbor is insane. She just expects you to watch and feed her kids all day every day, weekends too, and on top of that, *for free*???? Hell no. \n\nYou aren't these kids' parent. You aren't their grandparent. You're just the neighbor. \n\nAlso, your husband needs a reality check. If *he* wants to babysit two random kids all day every day and pay for/make their meals and get them ready for school and clean up after them and make sure they do their homework, then *he* can volunteer. Otherwise it sounds like he's volunteering you to do it all and no. No no no. Don't let him talk you into that insanity.", "NTA.\n\nLol, what are you ? Free babysitting? \n\nOf course your husband thinks you're wrong, since it's not him she asked for.\n\nDon't agree and don't let her force her kids on you. With all the crazy stories I've read on here, she just might drop them against your will \ud83d\ude05", "NTA she can look for before school programs or change her work schedule none of those include involving you nor your husband", "NTA - wow. Nope.", "That's a pretty big ask of even good friends/neighbors. If anything happens to those kids the liability will be on you. No. Just no.  NTA", "NTA. You said you work from home. You are working.  You can\u2019t be a babysitter too. And take on the responsibility of 2 extra kids.  It sounds like besides going to school and going home to sleep, they would be your responsibility.  And weekends? So when would you get to relax, spend time with friends and family, and do chores/run errands. That is crazy. \n\nIf you even helped a little, those kids would be dropped off at your door whether you liked it or not.  Stay away.", " Offer up your husband", "NTA at that point they'd just be your kids??? Wtf", "NTA, but you're not doing any good here either.  Jill's next step is to pack up her belongings in her car and either move to a shelter or live, with her kids, in the car.  You could help her out for a few weeks, even a month or two, while she comes up with a solution.  Instead, she is about to be homeless through no fault of her own.\n\nI said NTA because your not doing anything more than saying no.  But really, think of the consequences and what nightmares you would be facing if you were in the same situation.  It takes a village.", "NTA.\nI think I would have accepted in mornings until she found someone to pay to do the same... But would have capped it at a month or so. Not weekends. It takes a village. She should get child support from her ex and use that for their childrens care.", "She could do BASP, that would prob be her cheapest option.  But that still  leaves the weekends.   NTA", "NTA.... and your husband is wrong in lending a hand for a short time...because these arrangements have a way of becoming a long term thing.  She needs to come to recognize what her life is like without Jack in hers. That's what happens when she booted dad. She gets stuck with the fallout. Worse here is Jack is from a different country. Have fun getting support from him, LOL She's going to need to find a new job or move closer to family to lend a hand.", "She is simply asking too much. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour husband might be nice, but he's volunteering *your* time, not his and there is a 100% chance that if you watch them once, it will  become expected of you.", "NTA. She wants you to provide a service and not get compensated for it. Absolutely not and you'll be basically raising her kids for her. Should've thought about that before constantly berating her husband. He left the country to get away from her....let that sink in.", "NTA. Usually people start off with something smaller before gradually taking advantage of the situation by piling on more shit. This lady went straight to the worst possible setup from the get-go. Hell no.", "NTA. I doubt your husband would be so willing to help if he would have to be the one feeding them/picking them up and dropping them off every day and not you. What she\u2019s asking of you, especially for free, is ridiculous. They\u2019re not your kids.", "NTA and your husband is way off. Do you do all the parenting? This ask is WAY off base. Stick to your boundaries. This lady is unhinged.", "NTA. Sounds like she brought this shit storm on herself. She can figure it out.", "NTA\n\nAs SHE said, you are not friends and really don't have a relationship or kinship.\n\nSounds like these kids aren't even in your kids' social circle.  \n\nShe wanted him out, she got him out, she can deal with the consequences.\n\nShe is looking for child care.  People pay strangers for child care.  \n\nStand Strong!", "[deleted]", "NTA. If your husband is so willing to be helpfull, he can take those kids by himself every saturday. But I expect him having ton of excuses.", "NTA. This is a massive undertaking and it would be completely reasonable to turn down a request like this from a loved one, let alone a neighbor known best for her screaming fits and throwing her husband out of their home. \n\nShe\u2019s desperate and I understand that\u2019s where the request is coming from, but sooner or later she\u2019s going to have to face the fact that she\u2019s a single parent and budget accordingly. There\u2019s no end date to her request other than the children getting to the age where they can watch themselves. If she requires such a massive amount of support to pay her rent, when she\u2019s already a full time nurse, she might have to accept she can\u2019t rent a house anymore and that she\u2019s gonna have to deal with apartment living. It sucks. It really does. But that doesn\u2019t make her entitled to your free labor. \n\nAnd frankly, it\u2019s odd to me your husband would even consider you to be an AH here. He\u2019s got a child, why doesn\u2019t he see what a huge deal this is? Or does he just think YOU should do all the babysitting?", "NTA, let your husband handle your kid for a week so he can see what needs to be done to handle more kids.", "NTA\n\nNope.  Don\u2019t do it.  The fact she expects you, a total stranger, to provide free childcare service is just the tip of the iceberg of her entitlement.\n\nIf you help her now, eventually she\u2019ll start expecting you to pay for her kids to participate in certain extracurricular activities\u2026 or she\u2019ll expect you to willing put your life in the backseat to chaperone her children and her.", "NTA, but it sounds like your husband is volunteering that he can do it.", "NTA - Don\u2019t do it even just a little. In this case, I believe it would be you give and inch and they take a mile.", "Wow, that's so generous of your husband to volunteer his time and energy to help Jill. Oh, wait. He's actually wanting to volunteer your time and energy to help Jill. Let me guess, he's too busy working to help out but is happy to volunteer your services? Definitely NTA but Jill is and so is your husband.", "NTA. That\u2019s a full time job with the hours she\u2019s wanting out of you, and for free. You would be responsible for two additional children, and if there was an accident you would be at fault for that. 100% not worth the risk or the headache. Jill needs to get those kids in a daycare, and make better choices.", "NTA. OH HELLLLL NO\u2026.   I did that once to help someone. It was my son\u2019s friend\u2026 he walked over to our house. I insisted he eat breakfast bc his mom didn\u2019t have any money. Make him a lunch and then take him to school. He came over and hung out did homework, had dinner sometimes and walked home. \n\nThe difference.. they were 13..  he was the most polite young man\u2026 and I was heading that way to drop my son off at school and making dinner anyway.. \n\nIn no way was that child a burden to me and his mother never asked. He was a good kid.  Your deluded neighbor thinks she\u2019s entitled to free labor.. don\u2019;t let those children in your home.", "NTA do not give her an inch or she will take a mile.", "NTA. Jill needs to sort herself out.", "Definitely NTA in no way your responsibility.\n\nYou could be empathetic and help out at your convenience instead of a hard no. \n\nI think you probably know this, which is why you came to the subreddit. \n\nDoes it make you an AH, absolutely not. Does your response lack empathy? Absolutely.", "Nta.. sounds like if she wasn't so incorrigible she would still have a husband to help her out with these things. I guess she better look into before and after school programs and possibly rearranging her schedule. Plus, there are programs out there help with these things finacially. If y'all were friends or even if your kids were friends that might be different. But since she feels entitled to this makes it a solid nope. Hey, maybe you'll get nice new neighbors soon!", "NTA", "NTA. The entitlement is incredible. I wonder if she has any idea how much she would have to pay for a typical before & after school program with transportation. Do not give an inch, or she'll take a mile.

Because she wants it and no other reason or reward. \n\nWow, pretty clear why her husband left lol. \n\nNTA....time to go no contact and tell her to stay on her side of the fence.", "NTA, not only would she not do the same, she will take advantage. Your husband is wrong, if you give an inch, she will take a mile and completely walk all over you expecting more and more. Its her responsibility.", "NTA. I see why husband left", "NTA.

I\u2019m a mom of two kids, and think your neighbour is an AH for even asking - let alone doubling down after you (reasonably) brought up payment. \n\nI feel terrible for her kids though, and her husband is an asshole for leaving them there with her and not helping.", "Oh hell no. Not your circus, not your monkeys.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the entitlement she has. How are you supposed to know that she has no other help? It\u2019s not your responsibility.

And you'd still be free to say no.  Her kids and divorce are not your problem.", "NTA. She's already demanding more than I'd ask of my own family, nevermind a neighbour.

Nope. She can pay someone to help her.

Why does this have to be only your responsibility?\u2026because you\u2019re a women? \n\nIf he feels so strongly about it, he can take them.", "NTA, OP, what an absolute nightmare to live next to. Jill treats Jack like crud and then acts like the victim when he leaves? She created her mess, it isn't your job to clean it up. This means even if you were to help a little, Jill would probably take advantage of you, treat you horribly, berate you if you fed her children the wrong food, etc.", "NTA at first it's 'get them to school' but she wants free, unpaid day care  7 days a week with meals included. I think we can see why hubby left her and it's a shame the kids are caught out like this but even for great friends this would be a major ask. she's not a great friend.", "NTA.\n\nYou give Jill an inch now and she will demand a mile.", "NTA\n\nWow people really do have this kind of audacity, huh?

Either way, not your problem.", "No way. There is a little girl next door and I will help get her off the bus and she will play with my daughter for like 1/2 hour VERY occasionally.

It was very much a beneficial situation all around, as the money was helpful for their family. In fact, when my father was transferred to another state, the mom had to find a part-time job to replace the lost income. I don't know how much my father paid the family, but evidently it was quite reasonable all around.\n\nI know my family's situation is different, as my mom had been a SAHM and so we didn't lose an income stream after her death. Jill is now trying to support her family on one income. I\u2019m guessing child support is unlikely since Jack left the country. If I were in her shoes, I'd reach out to the school and PTA to see if there are any local families who would be willing to assist the family UNPAID. I stress that the payment situation be front and center. If there's several families willing to take one weekday each, then the load would be divided.\n\nWould it be nice if your family helped out?

However, expecting anyone, much less people who aren't family, to be responsible for helping her get through it is so unreasonable. And expecting it for free?? It is a terribly sad situation but that doesn't mean that you have to take on that responsibility. Exactly how long does she think you should have to do this? 30+ hours a week when they are in school and all day when school is out for the next 4-5 years?It is too much to ask. Honestly, it's too much to ask even with compensation when you have a whole other job to do and a family of your own. I do feel bad for her but you can't personally take that on, especially when she doesn't seem like a reasonable person. You will never get out of it. I'm assuming you are in the US because she has a CNA job, in which case there are programs to help low income families with child care.
