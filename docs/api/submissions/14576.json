{"id": 14576, "submission_id": "12j4vto", "title": "AITA for not sending my daughter to a different school district so she could be in gifted education?", "selftext": "I have 3 kids, Michelle (7), Juliet (6), and Leo (2). Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?", "created_utc": 1681262141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j4vto/aita_for_not_sending_my_daughter_to_a_different/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We do not have that kind of resource locally and I wish we did. While we have mostly had amazing teachers who will adjust to our kiddos, my children have struggled socially. They simply cannot relate to most of their peers. Our school system doesn\u2019t see the issue because we are raising polite humans who can get along with others, but my daughter did not feel genuinely connected to anyone until this year (5th grade). \n\nRaising and teaching a child of that intelligence has its own nuances and challenges.

If you don\u2019t support her at her level her future will basically go in one of two directions. 1) She\u2019ll continue to be frustrated with her classmates, which could isolate her socially or 2) she dumbs herself down to fit in socially. Neither are good choices.", "As someone who spends 1.5 hours in a car (each way) with a 2.5 yr old and a 6 month old, I can empathize with your situation and your desire to avoid a long car ride. \n\nThat said, as your daughter grows, if she\u2019s not mentally stimulated enough she may be prone to trouble. She may also struggle forming relationships if she doesn\u2019t have exposure to peers who are on the same level. \n\nHave you approached your daughter about what she wants? This is a pretty big decision to make without her input as it heavily impacts her future and potential happiness.", "YTA. Your husband has explained to you exactly why.

Her brain is literally so far advanced compared to them everyday in class will be torture). She\u2019ll do poorly academically as a result of being frequently removed from class and not being challenged enough. Everything will just spiral from there. \n\nAs a parent it is your moral obligation to do everything in your power to set your children up for success in life, so why are you first in line to hobble her?

Other kids, and later other adults, are/will be unbelievably boring to her.  Forcing her to stay in her current school is forcing her to build an \u201cacceptable\u201d personality that won\u2019t get her bullied or written up.

The idea that parents, especially mothers HAVE to sacrifice everything for their kids is ridiculous.  If you have 3 kids,  you have to take the well being of all of your kids into account and not just 1.  People have this idea that women's time in unlimited and that they can just give and give and give. 2 additional hours a day is not reasonable. \n\nIt's not your husband's place to volunteer anyone to help ya'll take care of your kids. How is he stepping up to make this new school work for Juliet? \n\nSome things you can do\n\n1. Do your research on local regulations regarding your school district.  They may have a provision in place that will assist you with transportation to and from the new school for your daughter.  i.e ask if you can drop her off at her regular school and the school/district will be responsible for getting her to the new school\n2. ask if both of your girls can be transferred to the new school so you don't have 2 school dropoffs and pickups to do\n3. Your husband can be responsible for either pickup or dropoff for the girls\n4. See if there is a family/carpool you can add either girl to so that the burden of dropoffs and pickups is shared amongst a group.  So can Michelle join a carpool for her school and Juliet can join a dropoff for her school.  That way you don't have to drive ALL of the time.\n5. Ask your family to help but also think about what's going to happen if they decide to take a vacation or are sick.", "Unrelated to moral judgement, but please look more into the culture of this gifted school. Mental health can be a huge, huge problem at some of those schools.\n\nA few of my friends and I were all taking the same advanced classes in middle school, and all had similar intelligence levels. They went to a gifted school, I stayed at our public school (at my own request) and just took some classes ahead (remember that fully or partially skipping a grade is an option). Now, we'll be going to the same college and have roughly the same opportunities in life, but they're dealing with much worse depression and depersonalization than I ever experienced. The different cultures of our schools contributed greatly to this.\n\nI'm not saying this is every \"gifted\" school, or that my friends' experiences are representative of everyone who goes to even that one school, but sometimes those schools put success above their students' wellbeing.\n\nI was a lot like Juliet once, if I may project. I read books through recess instead of interacting with other kids and got annoyed at them for not understanding things or constantly having to explain myself. I'm only 18 now, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I think staying with my peers was really helpful for me. I've learned how to interact socially with other people here.\n\nThe times I've visited the gifted school for school activities, it has stuck me that a lot of the kids there haven't learned how to not be condescending or, to put it bluntly, play nice with others. Obviously, again, my own experiences, but it's worth looking into. If you can, ask students, not the parents who push them to overachieve.", "If being a sahm is your job, you should be fired.

Most experts will tell you that kids don\u2019t need gifted accommodations at that age. If you go over to hoagiesgifted (the motherlode of gifted info) they will explicitly advise you NOT to enroll your child in a gifted program that starts in kindy if your child is exceptionally or profoundly gifted. (Less important if your child is just gifted or highly gifted.) Few of the more rigorous programs start before 3rd. Dedicated schools may be the exception to that, but if those are intended for the highly/exceptionally/profoundly gifted, she could even end up being the dumb kid. \n\nIn any case I wouldn\u2019t take the advice of a school that can\u2019t handle its gifted students at all.

Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Gently, being a gifted kid with no resources would be terrible. My school only had gifted class once a week, and the rest of the week was rough! I had teachers who were annoyed that I was ahead in my work, weirdly felt threatened by it (even though I was a polite, quiet kid), and other kids felt threatened by the \u201csmart kid,\u201d too. \n\nGifted is a special education need just like if a kid has autism or dyslexia. It\u2019s not just being \u201csmart.\u201d It\u2019s a whole other way of your brain working that often comes with its own set of challenges. You may not have seen them yet because she\u2019s young, but they\u2019re coming. She\u2019s less likely to do as well in school (socially or academically) than if they\u2019re in the right placement. Juliet needs more to be successful. \n\nIf the school can\u2019t meet her needs, can they help with transportation? They\u2019re legally required to meet her needs per an IEP, unless they\u2019re asking you to disenroll and re-enroll so they aren\u2019t responsible.

Can your husband adjust his work hours so he can do some drop off/pick up for either girl? \n\nThat drive each day sounds AWFUL, but if it\u2019s really the best thing for your daughter, please don\u2019t dismiss it due to inconvenience.

That was school for me. Guess what? I was completely unprepared for college. Not only did my shitty school not prepare me to where I needed to be academically, I never needed to learn how to learn anything, because I never knew that teachers knew anything worth learning, because the academics being taught were so far behind where they should have been. \n\nSmart kids need to be challenged the entire time they're in school. It's a difficult path to walk, because you don't want to push them beyond their limits, but they need to learn that being smart is not enough.

A gifted child needs as much extra resources as a child with special needs. It is abhorrent that you refuse to make this sacrifice for a few years of your life so she can have the chance at a proper education. Keeping her at her current school means her risk of dropping out of school goes way up, risk of substance abuse issues increase, risk of poor mental health increase significantly.

It\u2019s not just about \u201cnot reaching her full potential.\u201d It\u2019s about basic quality of life for your child to have opportunities for socialization in addition to a level of academics that will provide actual learning.

Get yourself educated as well to the challenges that will come from having a gifted child. Her high IQ requires MORE support, not less.

I wanted to move her schools so she could get support all day,not just one day a week,  even if it meant driving 30 minutes out of my way. I also have a small child who is a year and half and it would be hard to keep them in the car that long. You have to really listen to the advice of the teacher but not necessarily move her schools now.  She doesn't know she's different from the other kids. And  if she's with her peers who she feels comfortable with,  then why move her now. At least wati til she's in 5th or 6th grade. That's what my daughter's teacher recommended.

Let her self study - both topics that interest her and her peers - to supplement her education. If she\u2019s showing any neuro-divergence, get support for that. But mostly let her mind and her body catch up with her brain. NOTHING BAD will happen if elementary school and middle school and high school and the first few years of college aren\u2019t hard for her.

This! I am also a SAHM to a 7, 4 and 2 year old. Our 7 year old is also gifted and we knew he would be bored and potentially disruptive at our local elementary school. I worked hard to get him into a program 40 minutes away that would help him thrive- and he is. Yes, I spend hours a day driving back and forth, but it's worth it because my job is to give them as many opportunities to succeed as I can. We've adjusted our lives accordingly- our 4 year old attends a preschool close to our oldest son's school and all three kids do activities in that area as well. We go play at the park, toddler gymnastics, run errands, bring our dogs for walks, read books etc. to minimize the amount of driving back and forth. Am I tired? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. OP- it will require some sacrifice and change on your part. But I bet your daughter won't be the only kid coming from a few towns over.

Busses are expensive and many districts limit their use. Districts do not pay for more than they have to. It doesn't sound like the family is in the district, so transportation would be on them.

Countless gifted kids have told how this happened to them and I've seen it happening, too. I consider it a disability that needs special attention.\n\nNormal school is for average kids.

There are often overlaps amongst the three, and an above average prevalence of anxiety, depression, substance abuse disorder and bipolar disorder. And for A LOT of gifted kids, these cormorbidities are overlooked for years due to their intellect and doing well in school. Even 25-30 years ago when I was in elementary school, there was research showing that gifted children needed just as much support and accommodations as children with ADHD and ASD and teachers could not teach gifted children in elementary school (in the district I was enrolled in) without special certifications. My mom had to get it when she got certified for other specialties.", "Yup happened to me. I was tested for gifted. Supposedly two points under in one test. They said no even with teacher reccomendation. I never learned how to study. Breezed through middle school with As. Did nothing but read.
