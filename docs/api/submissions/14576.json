{"id": 14576, "submission_id": "12j4vto", "title": "AITA for not sending my daughter to a different school district so she could be in gifted education?", "selftext": "I have 3 kids, Michelle (7), Juliet (6), and Leo (2). Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?", "created_utc": 1681262141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j4vto/aita_for_not_sending_my_daughter_to_a_different/", "score": 4743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We do not have that kind of resource locally and I wish we did. While we have mostly had amazing teachers who will adjust to our kiddos, my children have struggled socially. They simply cannot relate to most of their peers. Our school system doesn\u2019t see the issue because we are raising polite humans who can get along with others, but my daughter did not feel genuinely connected to anyone until this year (5th grade). \n\nRaising and teaching a child of that intelligence has its own nuances and challenges.

If you don\u2019t support her at her level her future will basically go in one of two directions. 1) She\u2019ll continue to be frustrated with her classmates, which could isolate her socially or 2) she dumbs herself down to fit in socially. Neither are good choices.", "As someone who spends 1.5 hours in a car (each way) with a 2.5 yr old and a 6 month old, I can empathize with your situation and your desire to avoid a long car ride. \n\nThat said, as your daughter grows, if she\u2019s not mentally stimulated enough she may be prone to trouble. She may also struggle forming relationships if she doesn\u2019t have exposure to peers who are on the same level. \n\nHave you approached your daughter about what she wants? This is a pretty big decision to make without her input as it heavily impacts her future and potential happiness.", "YTA. Your husband has explained to you exactly why.

Her brain is literally so far advanced compared to them everyday in class will be torture). She\u2019ll do poorly academically as a result of being frequently removed from class and not being challenged enough. Everything will just spiral from there. \n\nAs a parent it is your moral obligation to do everything in your power to set your children up for success in life, so why are you first in line to hobble her?

Other kids, and later other adults, are/will be unbelievably boring to her.  Forcing her to stay in her current school is forcing her to build an \u201cacceptable\u201d personality that won\u2019t get her bullied or written up.

The idea that parents, especially mothers HAVE to sacrifice everything for their kids is ridiculous.  If you have 3 kids,  you have to take the well being of all of your kids into account and not just 1.  People have this idea that women's time in unlimited and that they can just give and give and give. 2 additional hours a day is not reasonable. \n\nIt's not your husband's place to volunteer anyone to help ya'll take care of your kids. How is he stepping up to make this new school work for Juliet? \n\nSome things you can do\n\n1. Do your research on local regulations regarding your school district.  They may have a provision in place that will assist you with transportation to and from the new school for your daughter.  i.e ask if you can drop her off at her regular school and the school/district will be responsible for getting her to the new school\n2. ask if both of your girls can be transferred to the new school so you don't have 2 school dropoffs and pickups to do\n3. Your husband can be responsible for either pickup or dropoff for the girls\n4. See if there is a family/carpool you can add either girl to so that the burden of dropoffs and pickups is shared amongst a group.  So can Michelle join a carpool for her school and Juliet can join a dropoff for her school.  That way you don't have to drive ALL of the time.\n5. Ask your family to help but also think about what's going to happen if they decide to take a vacation or are sick.", "Unrelated to moral judgement, but please look more into the culture of this gifted school. Mental health can be a huge, huge problem at some of those schools.\n\nA few of my friends and I were all taking the same advanced classes in middle school, and all had similar intelligence levels. They went to a gifted school, I stayed at our public school (at my own request) and just took some classes ahead (remember that fully or partially skipping a grade is an option). Now, we'll be going to the same college and have roughly the same opportunities in life, but they're dealing with much worse depression and depersonalization than I ever experienced. The different cultures of our schools contributed greatly to this.\n\nI'm not saying this is every \"gifted\" school, or that my friends' experiences are representative of everyone who goes to even that one school, but sometimes those schools put success above their students' wellbeing.\n\nI was a lot like Juliet once, if I may project. I read books through recess instead of interacting with other kids and got annoyed at them for not understanding things or constantly having to explain myself. I'm only 18 now, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I think staying with my peers was really helpful for me. I've learned how to interact socially with other people here.\n\nThe times I've visited the gifted school for school activities, it has struck me that a lot of the kids there haven't learned how to not be condescending or, to put it bluntly, play nice with others. Obviously, again, my own experiences, but it's worth looking into. If you can, ask students, not the parents who push them to overachieve.", "If being a sahm is your job, you should be fired.

That\u2019s clearly above average, but at the same time really not so far outside the norm - there are a lot of kids at that level. I was, and my gifted son was there with the math (though he\u2019s dyslexic). Neither of us are all that. \n\nMore importantly, Juliet is in kindergarten. Most experts will tell you that kids don\u2019t need gifted accommodations at that age. If you go over to hoagiesgifted (the motherlode of gifted info) they will explicitly advise you NOT to enroll your child in a gifted program that starts in kindy if your child is exceptionally or profoundly gifted. (Less important if your child is just gifted or highly gifted.) Few of the more rigorous programs start before 3rd. Dedicated schools may be the exception to that, but if those are intended for the highly/exceptionally/profoundly gifted, she could even end up being the dumb kid. \n\nIn any case I wouldn\u2019t take the advice of a school that can\u2019t handle its gifted students at all. It would make more sense to take her in for an assessment to find out what her real needs are before deciding.", "Nta. She is 6.

Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Gently, being a gifted kid with no resources would be terrible. My school only had gifted class once a week, and the rest of the week was rough! I had teachers who were annoyed that I was ahead in my work, weirdly felt threatened by it (even though I was a polite, quiet kid), and other kids felt threatened by the \u201csmart kid,\u201d too. \n\nGifted is a special education need just like if a kid has autism or dyslexia. It\u2019s not just being \u201csmart.\u201d It\u2019s a whole other way of your brain working that often comes with its own set of challenges. You may not have seen them yet because she\u2019s young, but they\u2019re coming. She\u2019s less likely to do as well in school (socially or academically) than if they\u2019re in the right placement. Juliet needs more to be successful. \n\nIf the school can\u2019t meet her needs, can they help with transportation? They\u2019re legally required to meet her needs per an IEP, unless they\u2019re asking you to disenroll and re-enroll so they aren\u2019t responsible.

That was school for me. Guess what? I was completely unprepared for college. Not only did my shitty school not prepare me to where I needed to be academically, I never needed to learn how to learn anything, because I never knew that teachers knew anything worth learning, because the academics being taught were so far behind where they should have been. \n\nSmart kids need to be challenged the entire time they're in school. It's a difficult path to walk, because you don't want to push them beyond their limits, but they need to learn that being smart is not enough.

A gifted child needs as much extra resources as a child with special needs. It is abhorrent that you refuse to make this sacrifice for a few years of your life so she can have the chance at a proper education.

It\u2019s not just about \u201cnot reaching her full potential.\u201d It\u2019s about basic quality of life for your child to have opportunities for socialization in addition to a level of academics that will provide actual learning.

I wanted to move her schools so she could get support all day,not just one day a week,  even if it meant driving 30 minutes out of my way. I also have a small child who is a year and half and it would be hard to keep them in the car that long. You have to really listen to the advice of the teacher but not necessarily move her schools now.  She doesn't know she's different from the other kids. And  if she's with her peers who she feels comfortable with,  then why move her now. At least wati til she's in 5th or 6th grade. That's what my daughter's teacher recommended.

The lack of mental exercise will cause damage that will be felt throughout her childhood and further.\n\nAlso please have her tested for ADHD within a few years because it can show in girls like this, if she does have it she doesn't have to take medication for quite a while but an early diagnosis is very powerful for her future when she may need it.", "I have a friend who tested out of everything you put in front of him until high school, where he was so bored he did no work and just couldn't cut his grades.

My parents pulled me out of regular public school when I was in elementary school and sent me to a variety of private and charter schools, which looking back was not the right decision for my social development. I actually got a worse education in some ways because they were much less structured. I think that the gifted program could be a good option in a few years, but if it\u2019s too much of a burden now, there\u2019s no harm in waiting and making sure it\u2019s worth it. \n\nI will also say that my magnet schools were about a 45 minute drive away, which was hard on me. I hated being in the car that much. I also never had friends in my own neighborhood. I came home with a ton of homework and was very lonely. \n\nPlus, there has to be at least a few other gifted kids at her school, or at least kids sort of at her level.

When parents take short cuts for their own comfort, children miss out on important growing opportunities, and it almost always comes back to bite them as an adult. Even kids that cant get what they need for legitimate reasons, such as financial struggles, suffer from the effects as adults and have to grow to overcome them.

So, I rebeled against them... especially when I realized they were more worried about what others thought of them than disciplining me.

The building is new, the test scores are good, the kids have resources, but I think the kids they're getting have more to do with their success than the teachers they have.

With a really bad mark because she was doing those two years during the \"puberty dip\" that seems common with most kids. Then she didn't know what to do because she couldn't start studying yet, her grade was not good enough and she was too young for a year abroad, so she hang around for two years. \n\n\nShe is extremely arrogant and so are her friends from the same school. They all think they are better than everyone else, however socially inept.\n\nSo from what I saw with my niece I think it's better to do more things after school that are challenging. What OPs daughter  needs is to learn social skills and that won't happen at the gifted school from what I have seen.", "One difference though... In a normal class you either have to hide your abilities or you will be bullied, because the other kids think that any time your abilities show, you are only showing off and trying to make everyone else feel bad. In an advanced class you don't have that problem.\n\nFinish a maths test in 15 mins and get the perfect score when everyone else in the class gets B or worse after spending an hour on it? Guaranteed to get you bullied. Never do any homework but still know the answer to every question the teacher asks?

This is a joint decision. Why didn't you even ask your daughter if she'd want to go to that school.  \n\nWhy won't you even consider asking your ILs? Why does this bother you so much.

If family sacrifices need to be made for a child\u2019s education, I think it is fair to consider a range of options including moving the family, not defaulting to you and the infant driving around. This is a long term investment and it\u2019s not fair to your other children if you are spending all your time in driving for one of them.", "YTA.\n\nMy daughter was in a similar position. She went to a normal school and right from the start every teacher who worked with her told us she was exceptional. She was way ahead of every other child in the class.\n\nShe would come home crying because she hated school. She had friends, academically she was doing great, but she was bored in every lesson. The teachers didn't have the time or the resources to give her the individual support she needed, she was stuck learning at the same pace as the other children and hated it.\n\nThen my wife's crazy-generous family stepped forward and offered to pay to send her to a very prestigious private school. I was doubtful for so many reasons I won't bore you with, but a tour of the school with the head teacher convinced me to at least try it.\n\nOur daughter has flourished there! She loves the school, the teachers, and her classmates. She's learning at a pace that honestly makes us dizzy, and she regularly comes home and teaches us things! She turns 9 tomorrow, but her learning and development are more like an 11-12 year old.

Consequently I spent kindergarten through third grade BORED OUT OF MY MIND having to sit at my desk  and listen to the rest of the class stumble and bumble their way through the ABC's and 2+2.  The result was that I HATED SCHOOL WITH A PASSION and told the teachers there was no effing way I was going to college because I hated school so much. Instead, I became a truck driver.  At least THAT was interesting.", "YTA \n\nYou've set your child up for a life of never truly having her brain stimulated. She's gifted, she needs specialized teaching to keep up with her brain and her school found that for you and you're lucky it's only 30 minutes away and yet thats too far for you. You even said the school starts and ends 45 mins later than the normal school so you'd still have time to get both your girls to school on time. Saying no just because you can't be bothered to have your 2 year old in the car more than usual is selfish and frankly your husband is right to be furious with you. You said you had options to make this work too but you aren't even going to talk to your in laws and just assume they don't want to take 2 measly hours out of their day to get this girl to a school that can support her educational needs. You're the biggest AH.", "Two hours a day? That is a LOT of time that could be spent enriching her life and extending learning opportunities for her. What if she decides she wants to play sports? Gets involved in a musical instrument? Makes close friends at the faraway school and then has to say no to parties because it's too inconvenient? And how will you manage the impact that this will inevitably have on your other children, who might have agendas and interests of their own?\n\nAlso, before anyone signs up for a \"fantastic\" school that's all about gifted and talented, check out what is going on in the high school. Is it full of miserable kids who are competing relentlessly against each other to be the ones the guidance counselors will recommend for top Ivies? Do students there routinely take the SAT/ACT three, four, or even five times because a 1500 or a 33 isn't good enough? Are they spending all of their time building their resumes with meaningless clubs and activities, or are they doing things that they really love?\n\nAnd while it's wonderful that the other school has opportunities, from what I have seen, it's a waste of her talents and capacity to do half of college in community college. She is likely to want to do a four-year degree, I presume. Most students do better and get more out of the experience if they do a four-year degree at one institution where they can put down roots and really get to know faculty. Give her the support she needs and encourage her to live a rich, varied life. The rest is likely to take care of itself, including earning merit money to attend a wonderful university.\n\nNTA, as a person in education and the parent of exceptionally smart adults who survived public schools and did fine in college. AND as a person who went to a shitty public school where I was working way above grade level the whole way through but nonetheless managed to survive, get into and graduate from a top college, and get further degrees from top-flight institutions afterward. \n\nA lot of it is about whether you can teach your daughter to have a little resilience. Alternatively you can teach her to be a hothouse flower who cannot endure boredom or interactions with people who are \"beneath her\" intellectually, but I guarantee you that won't lead to a happy life. Genius alone won't get her there. And that is what you want, right? You and your hubs need to have a serious conversation and perhaps work with a counselor about this.", "I\u2019m going against the grain NTA- your school district should have to figure it out the transportation.

How will you work out the logistics of picking everyone up. \nPerhaps it\u2019s time to move to a better district but I bet you likely wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it. So again NTA because you have to take on this responsibility on top of everything else you do.

As an educator, I cannot emphasize how huge an issue it is that there are children who are not able to be academically challenged enough because the school they currently go to doesn\u2019t have the resources for it. It\u2019s just as big of an issue as schools that don\u2019t have the resources for academically struggling students, if not more. \n\nMany schools end up putting in so much effort to trying to catch up the students who are falling behind (which is great, of course!), but they often don\u2019t put in as much effort to stretch those who are academically gifted. You can\u2019t just give a gifted child an extra worksheet to complete and call it a day, they need activities that are thought-provoking and challenging!\n\nAcademically gifted children NEED to be challenged. They will end up becoming bored in class and won\u2019t be able to live up to their full potential.

She didn\u2019t fit in with the kids in the mainstream school no matter how hard she tried. I transferred her to the new school (and told him where to shove it) and she went from failing to straight As. \n\nThis is just my family\u2019s experience, and only you can know your own, but please consider that the extra effort to allow her to thrive may be well worth it.", "I'm not exactly sure what judgement to give, I see both sides.\n\nI was an autistic gifted kid in primary school as well. (Btw I'm noticing autism traits, you should look into that) But I wasnt gifted forever, around year 9, I started to level out. Gifted schools can sometimes apply unnecessary pressure onto children, they grow up with certain expectations of themselves. OR she'll finally be at a pace that she likes and be able to learn and grow as she pleases. She could relate more to the other kids at the gifted school. Learning can be exciting and I do remember feeling bored with the level they had me at, I wanted a challenge. I think I also annoyed my teacher's because I kept wanting more and harder work, and it was difficult to accommodate me. Plus, I was picked on for answering all the questions and being good in class. Kinda hurt to hear from the teacher \"can anyone else except [me] answer?\". I had an opportunity to go to a gifted school but I turned it down, but I can't say that if I went back in time I would make the same decision. \n\nI also see it from a mother's perspective. Having young children in the car for long periods of time is 1) not healthy and 2) can be quite difficult. I've BEEN that kid in the car, it's tiring even from my perspective. Moving schools is difficult. I've been to 3 primary schools in 3 different states, and 2 different highschools. My mum at one point had to drive me to the train station before 7am, drive back home, drive to kindy, drive to primary school, drive to highschool and then drive back home. It's a lot. It's difficult when your children are at all different schools and I understand wanting to keep your child at the school they already go to. It's so much easier, and it alleviates a lot of stress. Plus the cost of a new school, new uniform and with how expensive petrol is nowadays. Being a SAHM IS stressful, she shouldnt have to bend over backwards because people expect her to.\n\nHowever, you need to think about your daughter. Does she even know that this school is an option? Does she want to go? Her decision matters too, no matter how young she is. My father wanted my younger brothers to go to a different school that was closer to his house. My brothers (9 & 11 at the time) told my mother that they wanted to stay at their school, so my mother fought for it. But she also would've fought for their decision to move, and I think that's why people are voting YTA. You aren't fighting for what your daughter wants. Not that she wants to move schools, since we don't know that yet, but that she wants to learn at HER level, which the other school can provide. I hate comparing you to other mothers like the other comments have, which I feel is unfair BUT I kinda need to. My mother has fought for all of us. Fought for me to drop out of high school and pursue tertiary education early. Fought for my sister to go to 3 different high schools, stay back a grade and to continue up when the school wanted to keep her back. Is currently now fighting for my brother to move to his second high school because he is being bullied at his current one and the school is doing shit about it. It's not like we have endless amounts of money either. My mum has just started a job after 17 years of being unable to work, and we are still living paycheck to paycheck off government benefits. But she prioritises OUR wellbeing and our education, and she will get it done. \n\nI think what needs to be done, is to talk to your kid, ask if she wants to move to this school. Tell her without any bias (\"it'll be a big drive for mummy and it might cost a lot\") Don't make her feel guilty for making a decision. Is there anything really keeping her there?

I\u2019m still not formally diagnosed but my male cousin was at least diagnosed with ADHD.  I suspect he\u2019s also somewhere on the autism spectrum. \n\nPossibly myself as well, but I hesitate to conjecture because I see it\u2019s considered extremely disrespectful and distasteful to self diagnose autism. Unfortunately I lack the means and the courage to pursue a diagnosis. But if I could know for sure, it would be wonderful and would explain a lot of my struggles to communicate with people in person. I do okay in writing. Not great, but okay.  \n\nHowever I am sure I\u2019ve suffered with ADHD all my life. My dad and I discussed how something was wrong with me but we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. I was considered gifted and was able to keep my grades high but it took me four times as long as most people to complete my work because I was constantly distracted. My time management skills were non existent. \n\nNow thanks to the internet, I see I\u2019m practically a textbook case of a female struggling with ADHD but able to force myself to sit still and \u201cbe good\u201d in a way my male cousin wasn\u2019t. And so I slipped through the cracks. \n\nHowever, with my current access to medical care there\u2019s no hope I\u2019ll ever know if I\u2019m autistic. I\u2019m too old at 56 and I have battled sexism and even sexual harassment to get physical ailments diagnosed. I don\u2019t dare try to get my doctor to help me figure out something like this. Before the pandemic, maybe. But my access to doctors has fallen off a cliff after the pandemic. I\u2019d rather work on getting my daughter evaluated. There\u2019s a long waitlist but through her pediatrician, she\u2019s got a chance at being seen. \n\nI don\u2019t feel let down by my public education system. It was very good in that era and I had very dedicated teachers. I feel the curriculum was so much better than it seems to be now.  I do think the gifted students program was too new and poorly designed though. That\u2019s one thing that probably has improved over the generations. \n\nI\u2019m horrified that as late as the early 2000\u2019s you and other girls were still going undiagnosed just as my generation of girls did. But I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. I was entering the workforce then. Sexism and sexual harassment were still huge obstacles to achievement, as was racism. Perhaps worse in some ways, because unlike earlier eras, everyone seemed determined to pretend times had changed and racism and sexism were over. Overt racism and sexism perhaps were dramatically reduced. But systemic racism and sexism were flourishing under the radar. And sexual harassment was still prevalent.

Must autistic advocacy networks actually ADVOCATE for self diagnosing as an adult if you truly believe you are autistic. When you're older, it can be extremely difficult to be diagnosed, especially if you present female- I was lucky that I was able to get in to a female psychologist who I told 'I think I have either Autism, or ADHD' and she basically handed me my results like 'you have both, babe' lol.\n\nI was an extremely obvious case of autism and ADHD as a child and teen, which was ignored due to me being assigned female at birth. I literally had meltdowns and food sensitivities to the point where my mother had to make me snack packages for sleepaway camps, and as a teen I melted down in loud classrooms daily. I was finally diagnosed in 2020, after being evaluated three times as a teen, and autism never even being discussed.\n\nSo please don't be afraid of calling yourself what you are, there are thousands of adults in your same situation. For some adults, getting diagnosed might mean that they lose access to their children, to care, or to their immigration possibilities! It's okay and in no was disrespectful to be self-diagnosed when you do it in a genuine way. You know what your body and your mind is saying, even if sometimes the terminology you find and use is wrong- you know your experiences. There's a saying my therapist uses 'even if you find the wrong label, as long as the coping mechanisms and skills help, that's what's important'. If your brain is saying that autistic experiences look uncomfortably familiar, it's worth it to look into that because the amount of resources you can find when you accept that you are autistic, even without being diagnosed just being able to look up resources for autistic people is huge. I only found descriptors for certain 'quirks' of mine after I accepted I might be autistic- for example, did you know Autistic Burnout is a thing that happens for a large majority of masking people, which is an intense regression in coping? Like... For example... All of a sudden being unable to handle the noise of loud classrooms when last year you could? Or lights that previously were just frustrating, now being actively painful?\n\nSorry if this is a little rambly, I just want to emphasize that self diagnosis of autism and hell, self diagnosis in general IS NOT A BAD THING when used properly. I 'self diagnosed' with borderline personality disorder as a teen, which is usually a 'no, it's only adults'. I was diagnosed a year later during a psych ward visit with teen bpd symptoms.  The online bpd community (which is mainly bpd adults, diagnosed) welcomed me with open arms when first self diagnosed, and again when diagnosed and congratulated me for being self analyzing enough to discover it myself, and telling me that as a teen I had high chances of being able to heal to the point of being undiagnosable by the time I was an adult.\n\nMy therapy and the community support from my self diagnosis worked to diminish these symptoms to where I am, to this day, considered a 'recovered teen BPD case\", I can say that self diagnosis can be misused, of course but has amazing applications in being able to care for yourself.

Not all schools are created equal.  We were fortunate that he was in a school in a neighbourhood with a lot of smart kids and high achieving parents so JK to gr 5 he wasn't even near the top of his class.  The teachers were accustomed to accommodating gifted kids. Maybe your kid can move to a different public school.  Start by getting your kid identified at an IPRC.  Being gifted gets you an IEP that the school has to follow.  She needs a psych-ed assessment to determine if she meets the criteria for giftedness in your school district.  She may just be very smart.  Get her into programs outside the classroom that challenge her - coding, chess, music, 2nd language, math classes.  If she isn't very coordinated get her into dance and sports - that would challenge her in a different way.   Your daughter probably has short-comings.  Identify them and have her work on them.  Maybe socially she is behind and that is not something to ignore- that will hold her back no matter what her IQ is.  I can't stress that enough.    Being ahead of her class in grade 1 doesn't mean she should go to a gifted program - it could mean  she has an early birthday or had opportunities to learn that her classmates didn't and they will soon be at her level.  Reading is easy - give her more advanced books.  But reading and reading comprehension aren't the same thing.  Your big focus in grade 1 should be having a kid with no social issues.

Her child could potentially get two years of college paid for in her junior and senior years in community college...isn't that worth it?", "I have a friend who drove her niece into the city every school day and picked her up from her private high school. (She and her sisters lived together and her sisters were both widowed. There was one kid in the house and she was managed by all the women in the household.) At any rate, the kid really was a rock star student and so they all worked hard to help her succeed. My friend was the one with a job in the city, so she tweaked her schedule and did that part of the heavy lifting.\n\nLots of people will always go the extra mile. Its just easier when there's teamwork?", "If you're a SAHM, this is a decision to be made with your husband with both inputs equally.  You went against your partner.  Not cool.  You're a team. \n\nPerhaps you could mix with FIL and split the duty so you don't do it everyday.  Or like someone suggested, they can babysit while you drive.  That's 2 hours to yourself for a nice audiobook or something.  \n\nHUGE YTA\n\nYou're damaging your daughter's potential drastically.  If it was so noticeable that the teachers, principal, and whoever else at the school called you in and researched the options already for you, it's a big deal.  \n\nI know a ton of people who commute longer than that to work everyday.  You're being insanely selfish.  \n\nIf my spouse did this, we'd have a hard talk and divorce would be on the table.  Not exaggerating.", "Also shocked that so many people think it\u2019s no biggie to spend hours a day driving. Besides being a huge time suck, it will cost a small fortune in gas and car maintenance. And as the daughter gets older and starts with after school activities, she\u2019ll have to drive an hour in the middle of dinner time to pick her up. And lastly, check into your state and school district laws. I know my state requires schools to provide gifted services. And it\u2019s by child, like an IEP.", "Not true... Gifted does not = socially awkward does not = bullied. Times are different.", ">Being gifted is like having special needs. It is not about being better than other kids, it is about needing specialized teaching to thrive at school. Put a gifted kid into a normal class and they will be bullied and turn into an underachiever.\n\nno necessarily. what happened in your schools", "As an ex gifted kid, i highly disagree. There sort of skills i needed more help with were not those a \"gifted kids\" school wouldve helped me with, and my home life would have been much worse if my mother had an extra 2hr commute daily."]}
