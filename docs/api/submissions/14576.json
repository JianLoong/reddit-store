{"id": 14576, "submission_id": "12j4vto", "title": "AITA for not sending my daughter to a different school district so she could be in gifted education?", "selftext": "I have 3 kids, Michelle (7), Juliet (6), and Leo (2). Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?", "created_utc": 1681262141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j4vto/aita_for_not_sending_my_daughter_to_a_different/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We do not have that kind of resource locally and I wish we did. While we have mostly had amazing teachers who will adjust to our kiddos, my children have struggled socially. They simply cannot relate to most of their peers. Our school system doesn\u2019t see the issue because we are raising polite humans who can get along with others, but my daughter did not feel genuinely connected to anyone until this year (5th grade). \n\nRaising and teaching a child of that intelligence has its own nuances and challenges.

If you don\u2019t support her at her level her future will basically go in one of two directions. 1) She\u2019ll continue to be frustrated with her classmates, which could isolate her socially or 2) she dumbs herself down to fit in socially. Neither are good choices.", "As someone who spends 1.5 hours in a car (each way) with a 2.5 yr old and a 6 month old, I can empathize with your situation and your desire to avoid a long car ride. \n\nThat said, as your daughter grows, if she\u2019s not mentally stimulated enough she may be prone to trouble. She may also struggle forming relationships if she doesn\u2019t have exposure to peers who are on the same level. \n\nHave you approached your daughter about what she wants? This is a pretty big decision to make without her input as it heavily impacts her future and potential happiness.", "YTA. Your husband has explained to you exactly why.

Her brain is literally so far advanced compared to them everyday in class will be torture). She\u2019ll do poorly academically as a result of being frequently removed from class and not being challenged enough. Everything will just spiral from there. \n\nAs a parent it is your moral obligation to do everything in your power to set your children up for success in life, so why are you first in line to hobble her?

Other kids, and later other adults, are/will be unbelievably boring to her.  Forcing her to stay in her current school is forcing her to build an \u201cacceptable\u201d personality that won\u2019t get her bullied or written up.

The idea that parents, especially mothers HAVE to sacrifice everything for their kids is ridiculous.  If you have 3 kids,  you have to take the well being of all of your kids into account and not just 1.  People have this idea that women's time in unlimited and that they can just give and give and give. 2 additional hours a day is not reasonable. \n\nIt's not your husband's place to volunteer anyone to help ya'll take care of your kids. How is he stepping up to make this new school work for Juliet? \n\nSome things you can do\n\n1. Do your research on local regulations regarding your school district.  They may have a provision in place that will assist you with transportation to and from the new school for your daughter.  i.e ask if you can drop her off at her regular school and the school/district will be responsible for getting her to the new school\n2. ask if both of your girls can be transferred to the new school so you don't have 2 school dropoffs and pickups to do\n3. Your husband can be responsible for either pickup or dropoff for the girls\n4. See if there is a family/carpool you can add either girl to so that the burden of dropoffs and pickups is shared amongst a group.  So can Michelle join a carpool for her school and Juliet can join a dropoff for her school.  That way you don't have to drive ALL of the time.\n5. Ask your family to help but also think about what's going to happen if they decide to take a vacation or are sick.", "Unrelated to moral judgement, but please look more into the culture of this gifted school. Mental health can be a huge, huge problem at some of those schools.\n\nA few of my friends and I were all taking the same advanced classes in middle school, and all had similar intelligence levels. They went to a gifted school, I stayed at our public school (at my own request) and just took some classes ahead (remember that fully or partially skipping a grade is an option). Now, we'll be going to the same college and have roughly the same opportunities in life, but they're dealing with much worse depression and depersonalization than I ever experienced. The different cultures of our schools contributed greatly to this.\n\nI'm not saying this is every \"gifted\" school, or that my friends' experiences are representative of everyone who goes to even that one school, but sometimes those schools put success above their students' wellbeing.\n\nI was a lot like Juliet once, if I may project. I read books through recess instead of interacting with other kids and got annoyed at them for not understanding things or constantly having to explain myself. I'm only 18 now, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I think staying with my peers was really helpful for me. I've learned how to interact socially with other people here.\n\nThe times I've visited the gifted school for school activities, it has stuck me that a lot of the kids there haven't learned how to not be condescending or, to put it bluntly, play nice with others. Obviously, again, my own experiences, but it's worth looking into. If you can, ask students, not the parents who push them to overachieve.", "If being a sahm is your job, you should be fired.

I was, and my gifted son was there with the math (though he\u2019s dyslexic). Neither of us are all that. \n\nMore importantly, Juliet is in kindergarten. Most experts will tell you that kids don\u2019t need gifted accommodations at that age. If you go over to hoagiesgifted (the motherlode of gifted info) they will explicitly advise you NOT to enroll your child in a gifted program that starts in kindy if your child is exceptionally or profoundly gifted. (Less important if your child is just gifted or highly gifted.) Few of the more rigorous programs start before 3rd. Dedicated schools may be the exception to that, but if those are intended for the highly/exceptionally/profoundly gifted, she could even end up being the dumb kid. \n\nIn any case I wouldn\u2019t take the advice of a school that can\u2019t handle its gifted students at all.

Michelle and Juliet are in kindergarten and first grade at our local public school. Juliet, however, is very gifted. She came into kindergarten reading chapter books and was doing math at a 2nd grade level. She\u2019s obviously doing great academically but struggles socially at her school for a couple reasons. Firstly, she doesn\u2019t understand that other people\u2019s brains don\u2019t work like hers and tends to get frustrated when people take a bit longer to figure things out. Second, she\u2019s just a huge bookworm and would rather spend recess reading instead of playing with the other kids, then she gets upset that she can\u2019t talk about her books with them. \n\nI was recently called into a meeting about Juliet with her teacher, the principal of her school, and the superintendent. They basically said that they don\u2019t have the resources to support Juliet in her school or any schools in the district but there\u2019s a school 2 towns over specifically for gifted students from 1st-10th grade, then for 11th and 12th grade, they have a building at a community college and she would be taking college courses for high school and college credit. She would have to test in to the school but her school will provide the testing. The school sounds great for her but it\u2019s close to 30 minutes away from her current school. It starts and ends 45 minutes later than her current school so I\u2019d still be able to get her and Michelle to school on time but it would eat up at least 2 extra hours of my day and I don\u2019t have that kind of time for school drop off and pickup, nor do I have the patience to deal with a 2 year old in the car for 2 hours per day. My husband works in the opposite direction and wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her off. We could ask my FIL, he sometimes drives the kids around for me but I don\u2019t want to have him do drop off and pickup 2 hours per day. \n\nMy husband does not agree with me at all. He thinks I should be willing to make the drive for her and insists that I have the time because I\u2019m a SAHM. I brought up the issue of having Leo spending that much time in the car but he says that I could just have his parents babysit. \n\nI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 2 hours per day that I\u2019d have to put in to take her to this school so I went through with enrolling her in our local public school for next year and my husband is furious with me for \u201cignoring her social and academic needs\u201d. \n\nAITA for not enrolling her in the gifted school because it would take too much time to get her to and from school?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Gently, being a gifted kid with no resources would be terrible. My school only had gifted class once a week, and the rest of the week was rough! I had teachers who were annoyed that I was ahead in my work, weirdly felt threatened by it (even though I was a polite, quiet kid), and other kids felt threatened by the \u201csmart kid,\u201d too. \n\nGifted is a special education need just like if a kid has autism or dyslexia. It\u2019s not just being \u201csmart.\u201d It\u2019s a whole other way of your brain working that often comes with its own set of challenges. You may not have seen them yet because she\u2019s young, but they\u2019re coming. She\u2019s less likely to do as well in school (socially or academically) than if they\u2019re in the right placement. Juliet needs more to be successful. \n\nIf the school can\u2019t meet her needs, can they help with transportation? They\u2019re legally required to meet her needs per an IEP, unless they\u2019re asking you to disenroll and re-enroll so they aren\u2019t responsible.

Can your husband adjust his work hours so he can do some drop off/pick up for either girl? \n\nThat drive each day sounds AWFUL, but if it\u2019s really the best thing for your daughter, please don\u2019t dismiss it due to inconvenience.

That was school for me. Guess what? I was completely unprepared for college. Not only did my shitty school not prepare me to where I needed to be academically, I never needed to learn how to learn anything, because I never knew that teachers knew anything worth learning, because the academics being taught were so far behind where they should have been. \n\nSmart kids need to be challenged the entire time they're in school. It's a difficult path to walk, because you don't want to push them beyond their limits, but they need to learn that being smart is not enough.

A gifted child needs as much extra resources as a child with special needs. It is abhorrent that you refuse to make this sacrifice for a few years of your life so she can have the chance at a proper education. Keeping her at her current school means her risk of dropping out of school goes way up, risk of substance abuse issues increase, risk of poor mental health increase significantly.

It\u2019s not just about \u201cnot reaching her full potential.\u201d It\u2019s about basic quality of life for your child to have opportunities for socialization in addition to a level of academics that will provide actual learning.

Get yourself educated as well to the challenges that will come from having a gifted child. Her high IQ requires MORE support, not less.

I wanted to move her schools so she could get support all day,not just one day a week,  even if it meant driving 30 minutes out of my way. I also have a small child who is a year and half and it would be hard to keep them in the car that long. You have to really listen to the advice of the teacher but not necessarily move her schools now.  She doesn't know she's different from the other kids. And  if she's with her peers who she feels comfortable with,  then why move her now. At least wati til she's in 5th or 6th grade. That's what my daughter's teacher recommended.

The lack of mental exercise will cause damage that will be felt throughout her childhood and further.\n\nAlso please have her tested for ADHD within a few years because it can show in girls like this, if she does have it she doesn't have to take medication for quite a while but an early diagnosis is very powerful for her future when she may need it.", "I have a friend who tested out of everything you put in front of him until high school, where he was so bored he did no work and just couldn't cut his grades. It didn't challenge him. He works at a post office now because it's all he really wants to do. School never pushed him, so he never pushed himself. A lot of gifted kids go under by a school system that can't support them.", "I was such an underachiever because I was bored as shit in school.  I had to attend summer school after my class graduated so I could graduate high school.  \n\nWhen I eventually went to college, I had  the highest gpa in my university\u2019s school of business.", "Oh, we're good at becoming underachievers.  We give up and do the absolute minimum to skate by.", "You don't seem to realize that isn't going to be easily measured.   I was one of these kids.  There's not a box to tick that says \"Hey, didn't this kid used to be gifted and now...apparently....isn't?  Like, what happened there?\"", "Same. I was reading this thinking this kid needs to get an Autism diagnosis.\n\nIt\u2019s very much overlooked in girls, especially those that are academically gifted. Just because they do well in school doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t REALLY struggling elsewhere.\n\nAt 34 I finally had a reason why everything seemed so difficult. I wasn\u2019t broken, I was just different. \n\nI am autistic. I needed those special classes but I was put into classes with people that didn\u2019t understand me and it did a lot of damage.\n\nOP, my heart breaks for your child.", "I made a deal with a devil a long while back. So my oldest child could go to an amazing school walking distance from my house, I agreed to do all the transportation when my child was in the custody of the other parent. That parent sucks and is basically the party funtime parent who won't lift a finger, doesn't parent, but of course kids love the lack of rules.\n\nSo for a long, long time 50% of my weekdays I get up extra early and drive 30 minutes each way to pick up my child and get them to school. In the evening I drop them back at Funtime's house. it used to be an additional 10 minutes each trip before Funtime moved a bit closer. \n\nSo I spend 10 to 12 hours every other week driving my child around to get them to the best school. I also have two jobs and two more children. I have taken jobs based on my need to transport my child. If I can manage two jobs, three kids, and 10-12 hours of driving, plus my 90 minute commute, you can do this. I have just over 2 years left. Your kids get one childhood and one education. It is time to step up.", "Sweet merciless Cthulhu I just realized that you are a SAHM. YTA. This is literally your job.

Seriously what do you do all day that this is even an imposition?", "Instead of saying \u201cI doubt,\u201d I recommend actually looking into it for Juliet\u2019s sake. My sister went to a gifted school far away and often carpooled with people closer to us. There was also a specific school bus that picked up many students from a designated location. With something like that and your FIL helping one or two days a week, it would be much more manageable. Check Facebook groups, ask around. \n\nI do think it\u2019s important to consider that your daughter is a person who will one day become an adult. I don\u2019t agree with everyone calling you super lazy; being a SAHM is a full-time job.

Not saying sacrifices aren\u2019t made or that things work out the way you wanted or intended but I think shutting down the idea of moving her kid to the gifted program because of the drive is really unfortunate.\n\nLike you say there could be a ride share option. There could be a ride share option for the other school, too. Is there a bus? Is there a before/after school program that would shift the times around making it more manageable? Could dad shift his schedule somewhat? Where can grandparents come in? Is there a babysitter option? I think we just don\u2019t know what kind of research OP has done, if any at all.\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to say she\u2019s TA because I get it, she\u2019s a SAHM of multiple kids and it\u2019s rough, but still seems like a big decision to make on so little data.", "But Op isn\u2019t even looking for options even if fil is there.
