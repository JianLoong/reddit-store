Also start looking for a counselor for yourself.\n\nI, like a lot of folks here, think your husband has some deep issues going on.\n\n1. This sudden change in behavior is troublesome. Does he just want to get away from all of you... every. single. day? Is he having some weird affair? Does he have some other secret habit? Does he really hate your cooking that much? (BTW, why doesn't he ever cook dinner?) There could even be a sweet, but stupid, reason (e.g., a surprise), but he's not doing your marriage any favors with this behavior.\n2. 'It's no big deal' is not an answer; it's a deflection. You can tell him that, whether he thinks it's a big deal or not, he needs to talk with you and honestly tell you WHY he wants to eat take-out every day. If he still refuses, then he's not being a partner to you at all. You can tell him that one way or the other, the truth of what he's feeling and thinking and doing will come out. The simple fact that he won't communicate with you and dismisses you doesn't bode well for the future of your marriage.\n3. (Back to my suggestion...) You don't mention a financial concern. So you and the kids joining him for take-out doesn't sound like it presents a financial burden. He says getting take-out is no big deal (implying there's no special reason he's doing this), so yours and the kids' presence shouldn't change that.\n4. Be prepared that you may find a big deep hole in your marriage and face deciding what you want to do about it. I'm sorry to sound so dire. It would be great for it to be a sweet, but stupid, reason. As long as he's not communicating with you, you have to be prepared that it's likely a more negative reason.", "NTA tell him how much of an ahole he is being, if he wants takeout he can either tell you earlier snd get it for everyone or he xan eat with his family or give uou a darn good reason he is disrespecting you like this.", "NTA.

Retired RN here, tons of 10-12 hour shifts under my belt.  Prepare, have kids/yourself ready (not obviously so) say great - we're going with you!  Even if you have food prepared, just turn off the stove/oven and GO.  Call him on it.  His reaction will tell you his priorities.", "You seem to like the bad life...\nNTA", "ESH\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, you have every right to be annoyed with him and his actions are somewhere between thoughtless and suspicious. \n\nIt seems this behavior started recently but has been pretty consistent for the past two weeks.  I don\u2019t think refusing to cook for him anymore is the way to solve this.  Sit him down and ask what has been going on.  Be very clear that you aren\u2019t buying that this is just a series of coincidences.  It\u2019s not just an occasional thing, it has happens every time you have cooked for the past two weeks.\n\nHe needs to answer these questions: Why does he want to eat by himself instead of with the family? Why doesn\u2019t he offer to get takeout for anybody else in the family?  Why does he eat it by himself instead of bringing it home?  Where is he eating? (Because he\u2019s bringing the garbage home.) Why does he choose to go out when he can see you are already cooking for everyone?", "Maybe he doesn't like chicky nuggies and alphabites", "NTA!\n\nWhy isn't HE cooking a meal for you and the kids?!", "INFO \n\nOkay, something is going on here. He waits until you start cooking to get himself (and only himself) food. What happened before he started doing this? Did you two have a row about you having to cook dinner after a 12 hour shift? And is he now being petty and showing you that you don't have to cook dinner for him?", "NTA, order in food for you and the kiddo, see what he does?", "NTA\n\nBut his behaviour is very worrying - does he see himself as part of the family at all?  Eating together is basic family bonding.\n\nAlso why does he not cook for the whole family sometimes?\n\nEDIT  Having read your comments, I don't understand why you haven't talked with him about this already. \n\nDo you generally not communicate with each other?  Don't jump to conclusions.", "It's definitely fishy.  He's hiding something from OP and she really needs to find out what it is so she can protect herself.", "She hasn't had an actual conversation. It sounds more like just a one-off \"why you doing this\" and him saying what's the big deal. That's not a true attempt to work out with the underlying issue here.\n\nWorking through a marital issue can't happen just through watching someone's actions and then making your own actions as a consequence. That's a great way for things to escalate into some serious tit for tat.\n\nThe two parties have to talk about what the issues are in order to get to the truth. This might require having a mediator with them like a family counselor or therapist.", "How old are your kids? Do they not ask for takeaway food aswell. That is a really shitty thing to do to you, but it's also really bad behaviour in front of the kids. He just outright disrespects you in front of them. \n\nHe should eat at the table with his family and teach by example. If he wants takeaway food, he should ask everyone if they want it. Something is really not right about this. You need to check the trash for receipts when he throws it in there, check bank account withdrawals and charges and then say you and the kids want takeaway aswell when he next does this, see how he reacts. You are definitely NTA. You need to sort this out though.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. My ex was like this. He'd do these incredibly weird \"fck yous\" and then I looked crazy when I said anything to anyone about it. It took 15+ years for my family to believe me.", "NTA for wanting to stop cooking. But I would find out first if he really goes to get fastfood or if he is hiding something from you. Can you look at bank statements or follow him?\n\nApart from that, it's weird that he doesn't stop after you confronted him. Were you honest about how this made you feel?\n\nDid you change your cooking or lifestyle recently, or made remarks to him about weight or health, so this would be a reaction or a pretty way of telling you he will eat as unhealthy as he pleased? That's the only explanation I can think of that is kind of logic.", "My ex would do things like this. He does want you to be pissed off. He's mad about something, he's passive aggressive, and he's pushing you to be the one to start the fight. That way, he can look like the victim later.", "He wants you to think he's eating fast food every night, because whatever he's *really* doing is worse.", "Yeah, making sure she sees it is a little on the crazy side.", "She should look through his trash and see if there's a receipt with a time stamp.", "Every job I\u2019ve worked has shown me 30 minutes is completely long enough for a marijuana break as well", "Someone who is so inconsiderate of his wife is probably not preparing a super romantic and well planned valentines", "This thread made my frickin day"]}
