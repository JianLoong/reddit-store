He is a big asshole.\n\nTime for an actual conversation with him to get to the bottom of this, because he is not being honest with you.", "NTA and your husband is acting like an asshole.", "So. NTA but I'd like a bit more info... Does he leave or get delivery?  If he leaves how long is he gone?  Has he not eaten your cooking in a while...even leftovers?", "NTA. He should be cooking for you honestly. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty strange for him to do this continuously though. Might be time for a conversation.", "nta\n\nbut you have more problems than him not wanting to eat your dinner.", "NTA if he's not eating what you're making, he's wasting food and therefore money. Food ain't cheap. It's super disrespectful to order take out when someone has cooked you a meal, and after a 12 hour shift too! I'd be pretty pissed too.", "INFO why does he disrespect you like this?", "NTA\n\nFeels very inconsiderate, he should have just gotten something for everyone and had you not cook at all. Nursing work is brutal, especially now.", "That's incredibly rude, if not already disrespectful.\n\nIf I was cooking for my bf (who would see that), just for him to eat some cheap ass fast food, i'd stop cooking for him at all until given proper explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s thinking that it\u2019s not a big deal to order in when you\u2019re cooking for the whole gotdam family.", "NTA but this makes it sounds like there are other issues here. This is a huge red flag IMHO", "NTA - do not cook for him any longer!\n\nIs he buying food for everyone or only for himself?", "NTA.  Sounds win-win since apparently he prefers take-out anyway.", "Def NTA. The husband should had offered or gotten food for everyone, especially since being a mom and nurse is very exhausting. You should have a convo with him and see why he keeps on getting take-out all the time.", "I think you wouldn't be if you stopped because you can't do it anymore, or even if you're just mad and fed up, but it's probably best to communicate your annoyance rather than keeping it in and brooding on it.  Looking at this from a practical perspective rather than a right/wrong perspective.", "NTA.

Mabe to make it *look* like he actually went out to that place when all he's doing is grabbing it out of a garbage can.    I'd go through the bag and see if there is a credit card receipt and if the number is the same as his.   Obviously if he paid cash it won't work, but it may pan out if the CC # on the receipt is unknown to you.  \n\nStill feels as if he's up to something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He knows what he's doing, being a complete jerk to his wife's long hours, cooking, and feeding the family while he's out stuffing his face with takeout. He's slowly extricating himself from the family for some reason, and I don't want to speculate on the worst-case scenario.

Why is he just going to get take out while you're cooking? Is your relationship otherwise shit?\n\nI guess you two are both adults, so why aren't you communicating?", "NTA.   Take a break. Quit cooking.  Let him get all the take out he wants, long as he pays for it himself   I hope y'all have separate bank accounts.", "He has repeated shown you he does not appreciate your effort in cooking.

Is that not what's happening? Why are you upset that he's trying to make things easier after a long day?\n\nAlso if you're working a standard 7 to 7 you probably would't have dinner cooked until 9pm.

How long is he gone?   And is the takeout always from the same place?

My husband used to do these very bizarre things that nobody would ever recognize as mean. They looked far too innocuous. But I knew. \n\nFor him to purposely throw the bag away while she\u2019s watching feels like him liking her negative reaction/attention. Something along those lines. It just feels very attention-seeking/punishing. It\u2019s one of those things where if she were to tell anyone, it would be easy for her husband to make her look crazy.

There's something going on that he is not communicating with you.   \n\nStop cooking for him until this  petty stuff is explained.

Have you talked about this at all?", "any significant changes in behavior in a long term relationship should be examined and talked about by both parties. \n\nSomething odd is going on here.
