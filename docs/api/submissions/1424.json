Because explaining reason to a mentally unstable person...always works. And magically they see it through a lens of clarity and apologize. Seriously?!?! He is very sheltered and doesn\u2019t understand basic psych issues. Tell him the conversation is over and if he continues you will block him on all platforms until you think a reasonable amount of time has passed. Better yet send him the Reddit thread. You were correct in how you diffused the situation. She was delusional and instead of correcting it you played along and \u201cfixed\u201d the situation. This is the best way to handle the mentally ill outside of a clinical setting. It is the safest way to handle the situation.", "NTA I'd send him back home.", "NTA but did you explain to your cousin that she was not mentally well? His actions of pulling out a phone and recording someone who has mental health issues and is acting volatile could very well blow up in his face one day. It sounds like he could end up causing an issue he fears to happen because of his own actions and fear. It's best not to engage with someone who is obviously unwell.

It's obvious the woman has some kind of issues and at the time was unable to read the situation with rationality.

Or at least would have waited for an explanation from you.", "I really hate when a mentally ill person is experiencing an episode or something and people act like it is completely on purpose.

And the cousin and the woman both fit that bill LOL.", "I really want to talk about that in the morning with him.", "I want to feel bad, but he also said that false accusations are more traumatic than being an actual victim, and he also called his hero JD a person of color because a native tribe adopted him or whatever.", "I know this sounds kind of bad at first, but you can tell by just being around her for more than a few seconds that she is unwell and needs help. I find it really pathetic when people egg mentally ill people on like that.", "Again, not defending his general character.", "I know. I find it kind of funny how all he has to worry about is false accusations while I can just exist and be targeted by any man. Yet apparently I am the \"privileged\" one."]}
