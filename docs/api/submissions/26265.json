{"id": 26265, "submission_id": "16ap0av", "title": "AITA for not wanting our neighbors' kids to use our yard as a through way after school?", "selftext": "Our neighbors are nice people. They have kids that are the same age as our daughter and they play regularly. \n\nThe school bus picks up and drops off on the other side of our fence meaning, it would be a shortcut to come through our fenced yard to get into the neighborhood. Otherwise you would have to walk out onto the main street and up to the bus stop. \n\nThis year our neighbor asked if their kids could cut through our yard to come home. On the face of it this seems pretty reasonable but it doesn't really take into account a bunch of other factors, for instance:\n\n1. The kids' parents will not be home - they've asked another elderly lady in the neighborhood to watch the kids for an hour after school. \n\n2. Our daughter does not take the bus - we find it easier to pick her up and drop her off ourselves. \n\n3. The gate locks from the inside meaning we will either have to have it open for them beforehand or an adult will need to be there to open it. \n\n4. We have a 130lb dog that will need to be put away. \n\n5. The gate will need to be shoveled in the winter so that they can come through. \n\n6. We're afraid the elderly babysitter is going to get tired of this and because our kids all play together, it will ultimately land us to be doing the after-school care. \n\nWe just feel it's kinda a big ask. We don't ask anything of them so there's not much reciprocating here.\n\n***UPDATE BELOW***\n\nAfter all the great responses from the community here, we went ahead and politely advised it would not be possible for us. \n\nThe neighbor then replied by saying \"ok, no problem. We'll have to go back and unregister our kids from the school bus and do some re-organizing\". \n\nThis begs 2 questions:\n\n1. Did you go ahead and organize all this without consulting with us first?\n\n2. Do I sense a bit of an attempt at a guilt trip there?\n\nIt's also worth noting that today is the first day of school so...

It\u2019s also 100% your prerogative to say no regardless of whether those 6 reasons are valid or not.

I'm not getting any demanding or sense of entitlement from how you describe it. so just tell them it won't work logistically, as there's a few different factors you're not comfortable with. schedule wise, is it even feasible, for one. and it's irresponsible to leave the gate unlocked given that you have a dog. additionally you wouldn't be able to control who else might walk through as well, and that can be a huge liability. also, I've heard that \"No\" is a complete sentence so no explanation is needed. \n\nETA changing judgment to NAH and added some explanation.", "Nta tell them it is not possible do to the dog being in the yard.

So my read on this is that they trust their kids to walk to the bus alone if it's through your yard, but not if it's around your house on the road. And they weren't going to have care for them before school, just after?\n\nThis is not your problem and asking for trouble. If they fall in your yard and you don't notice, are you liable? Are they going to start appearing sooner and expect you to take care of them before school? This seems like something that's very dependent on the kids, the parents, and the situation.

They have a SAFE school program it's called... Basically you need to register them for the bus or advise you'll be driving them. Otherwise the school will call you and tell you that your child wasn't on the bus in the morning. If you don't register them in the first place they'll be calling you asking how your kid is getting to school. That's at least how I understand it. There have been days in past years where my child took the bus but for whatever reason didn't get on at a particular day... The school calls us telling us she wasn't on the bus.", "I see!  That makes sense, and is probably smarter than what they used to do 20 years ago, lol.", "NTA- That is too many factors to risk.  \n\nAnd per your update, I think they probably didn't organize anything with it, They just are guilt tripping you.  \n\nIf they bring it up to you, with the inconvenience of reorganize and you can ask them. Why didn't they talk to you first before planning anything? Could have saved them some work\n\nAnd then leave a firm in stone that you were advised that you shouldn't do that due to liability by your owner's insurance liability.\n\nPeople seem to respect that someone else advised you on something versus your own choices. Don't know why.", "NTA at all. You had me at \u201cwe have a dog\u201d.  It\u2019s also a liability issue.  AND like a few extra steps are good for kids who are so sedentary nowadays", "I\u2019m not sure I get a sense they were trying to manipulate you.

How entitled does someone have to be??", "NAH.\n\nThey asked, you answered, and they seem to have accepted it.  Yes, there's a guilt trip being attempted, don't fall for it.", "Nah for the initial response. Y t a for how you read into their reasonable response", "NTA. When my brother and I were growing up (circa 70s and early 80s yes I\u2019m old. Lol) our elementary schoolyard was right behind our house. We had a front gate and a back gate. However, my mom preferred that we walked on the sidewalk in front of the house to the path. Why? I\u2019m not really sure. Maybe because it was better than walking on the grass. Anyway they always got upset anytime someone cut through our yard. Even after we were done elementary school we still went that way because in the parking lot is where the buses picked us up for junior high and high school. Sadly the school is gone and it\u2019s a bunch of houses back there now.

She also does not understand things like property lines and small trees dying if  ( heavy) kids climb all over them . My belief in boundaries confuses her but we get along well .

You simply didn\u2019t want to do it(no problem there, it doesn\u2019t need to be justified) but in some communities in some regions it\u2019s just odd not to let them. When I read this I knew they would feel they had to justify the request. That\u2019s what you\u2019re misreading as an attempt to guilt trip you. Rejections can be awkward when they happen. Different regions have different cultures, there isn\u2019t anyone in my neighborhood that needs to ask me if their kids can cut through my yard. They know they can.", "NTA\n\nSo the kids can't walk a little further?   Good grief.   The dog and the gate are significant problems, and I don't blame you for not wanting to deal with them.", "NAH\n\nThey asked. You refused.\n\nThey can't get through the gate.

My vote was NAH, meaning OP is N T A, and neither are the neighbors. If the neighbors freak out, then the vote would be NTA - OP is not the asshole, but the neighbors are."]}
