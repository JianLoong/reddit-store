She then was adamant about staying in my mums room at our venue (mum was to look after our 2 kids) we had said the kids weren't close to her and didn't really know her at all since she had been in dubai most of my youngest life and there wouldn't be room as it was a double bed and single bed the room was for no more than 3 people. My mum then kept going on about it and how it was a shame that she would need to pay for a room herself as her husband wouldn't be joining her it went on for a few weeks every time I spoke to mum.

It sounds like she really didn't want to be there. If she lives in Dubai she can afford the airfare and her own hotel room. I bet she paid nothing towards her stay at the hotel either!!!!!\n\nNext time you have a big family thing, just don't bother inviting her, she will bring the mood down.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister seems either really spoiled, selfish and/or unhappy in her life in Dubai. Whatever it is, it is definitely not your problem.", "NTA. Sis needs an attitude adjustment, and mum needs to act like a mum and be a parent to Sis. This was your special day, not hers.", "NTA.  Your sister is being a little brat and your mom is condoning the behavior (which is probably why it has continued into her 30's).", "Are you a mama\u2019s boy? Are the mothers bossy drama queens always stirring the pot and causing trouble in your culture? Your sister had no reason to feel special. So your father lives in Ireland but your mother lives in England? Your mother and sister sound exactly alike.

Hers will come.

You probably didn\u2019t even let her walk down the aisle! \n\nNTA! Your sister is entitled and should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA Not her wedding day...", "NTA", "NTA - this was your day, not your sister's.   What the h\\*ll did she expect?", "NTA.\n\nI mean, she flew all the way from Dubai and was probably hoping that the family would be excited to see her after she\u2019s been gone for so long, and only staying for a short period of time.\n\nI get where she\u2019s coming from. It sounds like she went to GREAT LENGTHS to come to the wedding and was sad she couldn\u2019t spend alone time with her mother, and her husband couldn\u2019t come. \n\nAfter flying 14+ hours one way, for ONE day, and feel like your presence wasn\u2019t wanted\u2026 that sucks.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t have done that for my brother.\n\nI get that it is YOUR WEDDING, and not a random Saturday, but c\u2019mon everyone has feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mum then threw a fit that I was taking the kids away from her.\n\nI'm sure this was a longer conversation than that but I don't quite follow. If your mother didn't like the idea when you first suggested it, why did you all go ahead with it?\n\nNTA. As best as I can tell--and it's very hard to tell--the reason your sister had a miserable experience (quite apart from the very stressful travel arrangements) is because she wanted your mother to attend to her needs in some way, and when your mother didn't, your mother blamed you for it. Your sister refused to even begin to let you be part of her trip accommodation. Who knows why.", "NTA. Sounds like a whole lot of coded language for shes offended she wasn\u2019t asked to in the wedding party, specifically MOH or Best Woman, and your mother agrees she should have been asked.", "NTA. Your mom and sister sound like the types that like to find something to get in a snit about.", "It was your day not hers.", "Sounds like sis was put out by the traveling to the wedding venue and her buttocks not being kissed for doing so?  No idea what her problem really was but not your issue to make her feel special about your wedding.  Nice for her to attend but if she wasn\u2019t attending to wish her brother & his family all the happiness in the next chapter of their life together- she should have just skipped it and sent a card.", "Nta it\u2019s probably best to just ignore her and this. It sound irrational", "NTA \n\nI find it tragic that you feel a need to ask", "Yes she tends to act bratty and get what she wants \nShe earns a very good wage both her and her husband do \nMy aunt actually paid for her plane ticket as \"part of a gift to me to have her at my day\" as she was apparently complaining she wouldn't be able to afford it \nWe did tell her when we sent the invite over a year and a half before the wedding that we would understand if she couldn't make it and wouldn't be upset we just needed to know by deadline for numbers for meals we then expressed again near our deadline that if she couldn't get time off work we understood. And my mum had already paid for the room so no she spent nothing on the room or travel as mum collected her from airport and took her back to air port and as stated aunt paid plane tickets \n\nI haven't spoken to them in over a year now since all of this as it was the straw that broke the camels back after a lifetime of being treated like that.", "She even said to our mum the week before my wedding I seemed unhappy in my life (I think she's trying to project her feeling on to me) \nI don't know why she assumed I was unhappy I am with the woman I love and have 2 beautiful children to care for and at that point before the wedding I had just beaten cancer for the 2nd time my hair had all grown back and I was about to give my wife her dream wedding I was beyond excited", "My mum and dad have been divorced nearly 20 years at this point \nI'm definitely not a mamas boy I actually don't think she even likes me tbh", "Yeah I'm now NC with mum and sis after this was the last straw this behaviour has been going on my entire life \nGlad to know she's not the only crazy one in the barrel and that I'm not alone in thinking she didn't need to be treated any different from the other 85 guests", "Sis is already married she got married a few year before me", "Yeah this is four paragraphs of who gives a shit. The sister felt slighted for some reason, OP didn't do anything to cause it, so he's NTA. When you go to someone else's wedding you expect the spotlight to be on *them*.", "I am.  This is my understanding:  It sounds like the sister stayed at max, 72 hours in the UK, and turned right around and went back to Dubai.  She was never going to pay for anything and was planning on sharing a room with the mother.  But the littles were going to be in the room as well, and they barely knew their aunt.  Mom continues to gripe about the daughter having to pay for a separate room. Op accommodates mom and sister, but wants his kids with people they know.  So his mom gets pissed about that.  OP was damned if he did, and damned if he didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t deal with his mother\u2019s passive-aggressive statements about \u201cfiguring out\u201d his sister\u2019s emotional lability.  What an exhausting family.", "This. 1000% this.\n\nI also thought the sour face was probably from travel and jet lag.", "So yeah a longer convo but basics are my kids don't really know my sis at all she never calls or text when I would call her it would ring out or a text would go unanswered for weeks on end she has been in dubai since my youngest was 4 months only seeing her again at her 1st birthday where she was in the UK for 2 weeks and spent a whole 6/7 hours visiting us as she was passing through to visit granny on arran and stopped by on my daughters birthday\nMy mum wanted to have the kids in with her to look after them as we stay in scotland and she stays in England she doesn't get the opportunity to look after them we thought it was a great idea booked the room my son is 11 and daughter 4 at the point of wedding so my mum and daughter were to share a double bed and my son would be in a single bed in the room \nThe room was 3 persons only \nMy sister wanted to stay in room with my mum \nMy mum said how it was unfair and the kids would be fine squeezing in \nI told mum no I wasn't happy with my kids being uncomfortable at my wedding as my eldest didn't want to sleep in a room with sis as he didn't know her and also didn't want to squeeze into a bed with my mum and his sis \nMy daughter had never stayed out with anyone at this point other that my mil watching her at our house when me and wife had went out date nights but we were home before she got up in morning so this also was a big deal as my mum had never looked after them \nBut mum kept insisting it would be fine and not to worry etc that and the fact sis hadn't booked herself a hotel room made me weary that mum would just sneak sis into room that night when we wouldn't be able to do anything \nSo I asked mil If she would be OK to look after them \nTold my mum if she wanted sis in her room that was fine and that the kids would stay in mil room \nShe said it was unfair and that sis didn't have a hotel booked it wouldn't be fair and that she wanted the kids in her room \nBut end of day kids comfort came first and they chose to stay in mil room we gave son the decision in the end", "she sounds like a freeloader to me", "Your life sounds lovely.
