She always wanted a nice snow wedding in the cabins we used to go to when we were in school. Everything was going fine until she told me it was a child free wedding. Now, that would be fine with my wife and I because we would just drop of my son and daughter at my wife's parents or with their godparents, but my sister had asked them to be the ring bearer and the flower girl. Apparently, they want the kids to perform their duties at the wedding but then not attend the reception. That means either my wife or I will have to be there with them alone in the cabin while everyone is \"partying it up\", but wait, I'm the best man and will be conducting the reception so it's just going to be my wife. What about food? My mom will give my wife 20 minutes to come in, grab some plates with food and come back because the mother of the bride can't be missing for too long. \n\nSo, they expect me to abandon my wife with our kids who are under the age of 7 in a tiny cabin that is not child proof, where the source of heat is a fireplace and there is barely any cell signal. This is the day after driving for 7 hours with said kids. Not only do I think this is not a safe idea considering it would be the middle of winter, my wife has never been to these cabins and the lack of ability to properly communicate, but also, I think it's incredibly rude to invite someone to a destination wedding where they are only allowed to attend the wedding. Although my wife says she can manage (she's really gullible sometimes and is a little bit of a people pleaser), I refuse. She's not being treated like a guest but as the babysitter for the ring bearer and flower girl.\n\nI tried to talk to my sister and the jack\\*\\*\\* I call my best friend, who always preaches about being there for friends, loyalty and whatnot, but they are not conceding or willing to compromise. I asked if my kids could attend until the toasts, games and food then all four of us would retire to the cabin and let them party, no. If we could go completely child-free and leave the kids behind, no. If I just attend the wedding and retire to the cabin after the wedding, no. My sister is against all of these ideas while the jack\\*\\*\\* has taken a temporary vow of silence. \n\nSo, I'm pissed and said I'm not coming. Which in turn, began the messages and calls from everyone. My family, the groom's family and their/our friends. My wife has openly said that she can manage this, but I know that's to keep the peace. My kids are also upset because before asking us, my sister and jack\\*\\*\\* asked them first to participate in the wedding and they were really excited because they're close with both of them. \n\nWith all these calls and messages, I feel I'm going crazy and maybe I'm the a\\*\\*hole instead.

You've tried to come to a compromise and they're not listening. NTA", "NTA.  Yeah, the bride and groom need to realize your kids are not props.  If their presence will only be tolerated for the length of the ceremony, *and* no one\u2019s willing to help you out with childcare so you and your wife can attend the reception, then this wedding\u2019s just going to have to do without a flower girl and ring bearer.

Or kids can stay home, or we can all stay home.  Pick.  If no response then we will all stay home.

If she backs down and acknowledges that you and your wife are still invited regardless of the children, you can tell those same family members how delighted you are to be attending but what a shame it is that the children are unable to come since there will be no childcare for them (bonus points if you ask the nosy family members if they would be willing to skip the reception to babysit the kids)", "NTA\n\nI mean they've really put you between a rock and a hard place here. \n\nYou know what, i generally am of the \"it's their wedding - their rules\" party, but this is just ridiculous.

NTA\n\nThey can't have it both ways, IMO.", "NTA. Under those circumstances, the children who are in the wedding party should be able to stay for the reception. My friend had a childfree wedding (and it was very small so only the immediate family even got plus-ones) and even she unbent and allowed friends she had invited who had just had a baby and were traveling to the wedding, to bring the baby to the wedding. To her it was more important for her friends to be there, and she knew that the rest of the adults at the wedding would understand why an exception was being made. And they did. The baby slept through most of it, and the family left the reception early, and the bride understood that the new parents had a baby to care for, hugged them, and thanked them sincerely for coming.\n\nIn this case, the kids are expected to be at the wedding, the wedding is being held in a remote location, there is no local childcare available, so this childless woman would see it as a no-brainer that the kids would also be at the reception.\n\nI'd tell your sister that there are three options. 1. the kids are in the wedding and therefore at the reception, or 2. The kids are in the wedding and you will have to leave after the ceremony to be with your wife and kids since they can't be at the reception and must be cared for. Third option, no ring bearer and flower girl, and you and your wife don't come at all. They can pick.\n\nIt's not like the bride and groom have their feet to the fire here, they have three choices, none of them ideal for everyone, but they must pick one and not be pissy about it.", "NTA... \nAlso, I can't imagine getting married without my niblings there. They are family and deserve to be part of the celebration. My best friends daughters (AKA my nieces) were at my wedding and they had some core memories of me because of it (and vice-versa). The smallest one died due to cancer a few years later, this makes me cherish those memories and pictures with her even more.", "NTA.   \nI understand not wanting kids at the wedding, but inviting them to be in the wedding party but then saying they can't be at the reception? That's incredibly selfish. Part of the wedding reception is supposed to be to thank the guests and the wedding party for attending. They want you and your kids to fill a role...then have your kids stay out of sight.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister and best friend want a child free wedding that\u2019s fine. However, a consequence of that is no kids as part of the ceremony.  Some modification needs to be made on their part, or they need to drop the idea of children in the ceremony. That modification could be as you suggested them only staying for part of it.\n\nThey can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Nta! They're using your kids for pretty photos then putting them away in somewhere they'll be bored but also there's no signal if your wife needed it. \n7 hours is a long time travelling for less than an hour\nAnd your wife's not being treated fairly.
