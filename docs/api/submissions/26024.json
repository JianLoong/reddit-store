Absolutely not. He has a mother and stepfather to do those things. If they can't or won't, that's not your problem. But the boy isn't to blame for his situation or his existence. His mother and stepfather are and they will pay for all of it as these two kids grow up. One will hate them for abandoning her, the other will hate them for being losers who could barely provide for him.\n\nBe careful with your niece that you place the blame where it belongs and help her to manage those feelings in a healthy way (as I assume her therapist is trying to do). Hatred is a self defeating emotion. Misdirected it damages both parties. I'm glad she had you to step up for her when she needed you!
