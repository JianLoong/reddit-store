Needless to say she was devastated that her family basically kicked her out. She is currently in therapy\n\nBecause of her situation my siblings and I have been pretty much spoiling her, showering her with gifts and taking her to multiple trips.

And your sister-in-law puts the evil in evil stepmother.  Good for you for telling him he's dead to you.\n\nYou're an angel for taking in Joy.  I hope with therapy and the love she's finally surrounded with she can heal.", "NTA, you are doing the \u201cparent\u201d things for Joy, since her dad kicked her out and her mom is abusive. Lee has two parents, mom and step-dad. You are acting like a parent to Joy, not Lee, so Lee can\u2019t expect the same.", "He chose his stepson over his daughter. He was fine with sending her back to an abusive home. How she's treated now (while thank goodness for that) is none of his or Lee's business. NTA.", "I hate when kids get caught in the middle, but I can understand cutting Jack off for what he did to Joy. If he isn't in your life and you didn't really have relationship with Lee before you don't owe him that relationship now.", "NTA.\n\nUntil Jack realizes that he\u2019s let his daughter down in favor of his current wife, he\u2019s not in a position to demand anything. Anna should have thought about \u201cfamily\u201d before kicking Joy out. While it\u2019s not Lee\u2019s fault directly, just like Joy, he\u2019s feeling the brunt of Anna and Jack\u2019s poor decisions.", "So Anna marries your brother, moves into his home with her son Lee, takes over Joy's room, and tries to pawn her off to her abusive mother?  What kind of fuckery is this?\n\nAt that age, boys and girls need to have their own rooms, space and privacy.  If they can't afford it they shouldn't be cohabitating.  Also, OP's brother seems to be a failure of a father for abandoning Joy like that.  I commend you for stepping up where her father clearly will not.\n\nNTA; now that he has effectively abandoned his daughter and has a do-over son, he can lavish him in all the attention he wants.  He has no right to demand Lee be spoiled rotten after kicking Joy out of her own home.  His priorities are fucked.  My choice of words for Anna wouldn't be appropriate for this sub.", "NTA. What your brother did was absolutely disgusting. Surely, there must have been some other way to arrange the house so two opposite gender teenagers didn't have to share a room. Or they could have moved. *This was a foreseeable problem* and he dealt with it in the most deplorable way possible: sending his daughter away. And now he has the gall to complain that his stepson doesn't feel like he's family? Well, no shit sherlock -- he isn't.\n\nIt sucks for Lee, too, I think he is likely innocent in this, unless he asked his mother to get rid of Joy. He's a kid, albeit a teenager and not a small child devoid of understanding. It's not his fault he doesn't have family, but he also doesn't get to glom on to his stepfather's family, especially when stepdad did such an awful thing.", "Oh my GOD! NTA. Your brother is a horrible father. And his new wife also sucks. I feel bad for Joy AND Lee. They're just kids. It's 100% the parents' jobs to make sure their kids are loved equally. Thank God Joy has y'all. I feel bad for Lee a little but idk what that situation is like.", "NTA\n\nJack is T A for getting married KNOWING there were only two bedrooms, forcing the teenagers to share and then being just fine sending Joy to live with her abusive mother. It never occurred to him that they need a larger place? \n\nAnna is T A for getting married KNOWING there were only two bedrooms, forcing the teenagers to share and then being the catalyst for sending Joy to live with her abusive mother. It never occurred to HER that they need a larger place? And now SHE is the one who is jealous of the trips and fun Joy is having. I wouldn't be surprised if she's also hoping you'll adopt Lee too.", "NTA. It was absolutely inappropriate to push your niece out of their house, then complain that you treated her differently than step. They made a choice", "NTA for the question you asked but definitely the AH for the way you talked to Luke who is completely innocent in all this.  Why would you talk to any kid that way?", "ESH. It's completely unreasonable to expect opposite-sex step-siblings to share a room, and your brother and his wife should have moved to somewhere with three bedrooms before they moved in together. And you have to accept the fact that Lee is part of your brother's family now and therefore part of yours. It's not Lee's fault his parents are thoughtless idiots.", "YTA for hating on a kid but your brother is the bigger asshole by far for abandoning his daughter instead of coming up with a better solution. \n\nDo I think you owe it to the kid to take him on trips and stuff? Absolutely not. He has a mother and stepfather to do those things. If they can't or won't, that's not your problem. But the boy isn't to blame for his situation or his existence. His mother and stepfather are and they will pay for all of it as these two kids grow up. One will hate them for abandoning her, the other will hate them for being losers who could barely provide for him.\n\nBe careful with your niece that you place the blame where it belongs and help her to manage those feelings in a healthy way (as I assume her therapist is trying to do). Hatred is a self defeating emotion. Misdirected it damages both parties. I'm glad she had you to step up for her when she needed you! She's loved and in the end that will matter most.", "ESH except the young adults involved.\nALL of you \u2018adults\u2019 have failed them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're just doing an extreme reverse of the parents.\n\nIf Lee has tried standing up for Joy or reached out to her in any (sincere) way, YTA.

Family and love are not a zero sum game. \n\nYes, take great care with Joy because she's gonna be pretty fragile right now.
