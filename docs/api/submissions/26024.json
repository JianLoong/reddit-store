Absolutely not. He has a mother and stepfather to do those things. If they can't or won't, that's not your problem. But the boy isn't to blame for his situation or his existence. His mother and stepfather are and they will pay for all of it as these two kids grow up. One will hate them for abandoning her, the other will hate them for being losers who could barely provide for him.\n\nBe careful with your niece that you place the blame where it belongs and help her to manage those feelings in a healthy way (as I assume her therapist is trying to do). Hatred is a self defeating emotion. Misdirected it damages both parties. I'm glad she had you to step up for her when she needed you!

It's Jack and Anna", "I mean, the kid very well may feel left out.  He's not in charge of who lives where.  But the same way Annabeth gets treated unfairly due to her parent and step parent, it's happening to Lee too.

Or if he presses charges somehow. Do they go to school together? He could go that route. \n\nYou need to file for guardianship if you haven't already. \n\nIf dad won't sign off, get mom to.

What is he doing to her. Why does he think he should be included in things.   He is 16, he is old enough to know and understand that his mother kicked her out of her home and made her homeless.

Did Lee suggest kicking your niece out? I really doubt that. Regardless, the parents should have rectified it properly rather than kicking one kid out. The blame lies with them.\n\nAnd your niece, as sad as her circumstances are, has *chosen* to become a bully. There's no excuse for that. I'm also curious - what exactly are you doing to stop that?", "You are absolutely right.    \n\nPlease protect your niece and keep them far away.", "Therapy, supporting her through her problems and talking about why bullying is wrong while helping her cut contact with them as much as she can for her own sake", "Agreed, being a teenager and not wanting to share a room with another teen of the opposite sex isn't wrong or something to be criticized for.\n\nUnless Lee was actively telling his mom to get Joy out of the house, he hasn't done anything wrong.\n\nAnna and Jack are the clear Ahs in this, that being said, while I can feel bad for Lee, that doesn't translate into him needing to be included into OPs family and their outings. Lee has a family, his mom and step dad. They both chose him, so they can be his family and take him out and do things. \n\nOP has established that they no longer consider the brother Jack, family so there's no reason to include Lee, especially considering Lee's inclusion could be detrimental to the mental health of Joy. \n\n\nCrap. Edited to add, OP really needs to do something about Joy though,because the active bullying by her and her friends of Lee when really her anger should be towards her Dad is not ok. I get where OPs logic comes from but honestly Lee doesn't seem to have done anything wrong, and is now isolated and being bullied, love you don't have to welcome him with open arms, but maybe one on one members of your family can I don't know get dinner or coffee with Lee just to see of he's cool. \n\nLike your brother is an ass but this is just a 16 yr old boy who didn't want to share a room with a 15 year old girl he barely knows.  Oof and the way OP as an adult is speaking about this kid in the comments, wtf dude grow up, you're an adult act like one. My original judgment was n.   t.  a.  but I'm changing it to ESH."]}
