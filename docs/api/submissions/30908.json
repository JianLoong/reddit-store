Truly, I think she behaved that way out of concern. Many people don't realize that manipulation begins at a very small thing and balloons up.  She thinks you are changing for him, and changing who you are.  To you, this is something small that will please you both and make you both happy.  To her, this is him trying to change you.  Neither of you are exactly right or wrong.  She should have just shut up and supported you on your day.  Your relationship isn't hers.  You aren't changing FOR your husband, but because you wanted something and it was for you both.  She doesn't see it that way.  See if you can get together and talk.", "NTA. If what is written is a true and accurate accounting, you are 100% correct and she is 100% not your friend nor the kind of person one would want as a friend.  Congratulations on your marriage!", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ask her to leave. You gave her a *choice*. She *chose* to leave rather than respect your choices. She also chose the morning of your wedding to launch l into a pretty nasty tirade of abuse about your husband. That\u2019s unacceptable behavior. \n\nYou\u2019re right about it getting out of hand. She\u2019s parsing your words to make herself the victim in order to get a payday out of you. You need to make it clear that she\u2019s twisted the narrative. She chose to leave and there will be be reimbursement.\n\nGood luck OP.", "Need more info: She paid for your center pieces? What else did she pay for that would need money back besides her dress or any bachelorette/shower stuff?", "NTA. God forbid you do something nice for your husband on your wedding day (obvious sarcasm). I don't really know what to make of the money situation, but just know that you are most definitely in the right here.", "You can never repay a kindness, but you can pay someone back. If she wants her money back, give it to her. You can't take back what you said or did she missed your wedding there's no redo. She shouldn't have attacked you and should have realized you wanting to cater to him and do the small special things is what love is about. She may have been your friend since 12, but the funny thing about weddings is you only need the bride and groom. So I don't know if you can make up or have a meaningful relationship after this. But regardless, she doesn't feel comfortable paying for a wedding she didn't attend, so YWBTA, if you don't pay her back.", "NTA. You didn't tell her to leave, you told her she had a choice. A choice that would have been pretty obvious to any one from from the point. She made that choice for her self because she couldn't get over her self. THats on her.  A wedding is not a democracy, you get with the program or gtfo.  And paying for some parts of it does not entitled her to a say in maters or to verbally keep attacking your fiance", "NAH - Her timing was poor but you didnt quite say she was wrong \u2026 and she apparently had multiple things to reference to support what she was saying, so maybe she was on to something. \n\nBut if you didnt want to have her in your wedding party still, thats fine and your choice.

She set her bouquet down and left. I didn\u2019t have time to chase her so I finished getting ready and I didn\u2019t see her the rest of the night\n\nReally? She put the bouquet down and vanished in an Attosecond (look it up), leaving you no time to so much as get the word \"wait\" out of your mouth?\n\nPlease. Your response doesn't explicitly say \"leave\" but it does say that she wasn't wanted. Then when she started to put the boquet down you could easily have said \"wait\" and started talking. If at that point she walked away as you were talking, you'd have done your bit to make clear that you didn't want her to leave.\n\nInstead, you did things in a way told her to leave without quite explicitly doing it and allowed her to leave, all so you could try to tell her the next morning that she didn't \"have\" to leave. That *really* rubs me the wrong way. \n\nSomeone who wanted her to be there but respectful of their feelings would have said those words the second she started to put her boquet down. And you have a phone. You could have use it to place a call. Yes you absolutely did have time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, she should have kept her mouth shut about husband.\n\nESH    and the sneaky way of getting her to leave without saying it then telling her the next day she didn't have to leave really rubs me the wrong way", "INFO: Is there a possible nugget of truth to what she's saying? Do you potentially have a habit of giving too much of yourself away without getting much in return?", "You did tell her to leave OP, and yes you should pay her back for wasting her time and money ESH", "As the Spartans said to Philip of Macedon, \"IF!\"\n\nNTA.  You didn't tell her to leave, you gave her the option to if she couldn't be civil. Very different thing. Sounds you're well rid of her issues.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she needs to talk to someone about the issues she is carrying from her previous experiences.", "Easy NTA. She decided to leave of her own accord.  Her being upset is entirely on her", "I'm guessing she is usually the center of attention in your relationship.  Trust her for showing you who she is.  And she did not accidentally run into you the next morning.  NTA", "NTA Just because she's bitter doesn't mean you were supposed to act bitter to appease her. Sounds like someone you and your husband are better off without.", "ESA. She should have restrained her comments on your special day. It really wasn't her business to say that. You shouldn't have kicked her out of the wedding. Did her comments hit a little too close to home? Because altering everything for a significant other and losing your friendships almost never works out.", "ESH.. I think YTA for not talking to your friend or having a conversation with her about what shes talking about or what she means and shes TA for acting like that towards you.. Although if she spent money in your wedding and didn't even get to participate I see why shes upset.. and I'm confused on how you even had a wedding function properly without your maid of honor?", "You didn't kick her out. You gave her a choice and SHE opted to leave.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s your husband! Why would you NOT want to do stuff he likes? I\u2019m my own person and make my own choices but I know my partner\u2019s favorite clothes of mine and enjoy wearing them. I feel like this kind of thing is pretty normal.\n\nYour friend is really projecting her issues with men on you. I feel for her but she\u2019s not being helpful to you as her friend. You\u2019re NTA.", "Naw \n\nCome on, she took her toys and went home. And like any child, she is now blaming you.", "That\u2019s a really good point, i want to talk to her about this for sure", "Thank you!\nAnd it\u2019s really unfortunate. We\u2019ve been friends since we were 12", "I mean, technically yes, OP gave her a choice, but when someone ends a sentence with \"...you can leave\" it doesn't sound like a choice is being given. \nIt just sounds like a polite way of saying get out.", "She just made my center pieces for me,and then her dress, her own makeup and stuff she needed to be a maid of honor\nHer own food and travel expenses for the party, which is still a lot of money, I\u2019ve been in weddings, but I paid for everything else myself", "Everything she was saying was about me doing things for my husband to make him happy as well. It wasn\u2019t like I was sacrificing my own happiness to do it, I could understand if that was the case\nBut again, she has a history of projecting her relationship onto me, and she constantly sacrifices her happiness for him so I feel like she\u2019s assuming I\u2019m doing the same", "Like clearly ??? And I\u2019ll be up it later too LMAO", "I don\u2019t have time to chase people on my wedding day, i told her she could respect my choices and my husband OR leave, I never outright just said go, but I don\u2019t have time to argue with someone why I chose to do something completely harmless the day of my wedding", "Her and I both have had a history of strings of toxic relationships, I met my husband and he was very different than my past relationships. From the beginning my best friend would say how sneaky men are and how I always have to be cautious, then when we did get into an actual relationship she would make little comments about his sexuality and how am I not worried he\u2019s gonna cheat on me with a man, (he is bisexual), she\u2019d make jokes about our sex life and I had to shut that down. It was never about him being controlling or anything of that sort, just trying to find flaws in places there weren\u2019t flaws\n\nShe is still with the same man she was with when I met\nMy husband and she consistently makes sacrifices to her own happiness to accommodate to his incompetence and it feels like she projects her relationship onto me in the past and it felt like that\u2019s what she did on the morning of my wedding\n\nShw always wanted a wedding and all of that prior to meeting her current partner, now she never wants to be married or have anything we always talked about, which is fine but I feel like it\u2019s partially because she knows her partner will never give it to her", "I don\u2019t alter everything for him, my husband just makes me happy and I\u2019m willing to compromise a little bit so he\u2019s enjoying our wedding too, I\u2019m assuming she thinks I was sacrificing my happiness and comfort which I never felt like I was doing at all", "OP didn't tell her friend to leave though. They just presented them with the obvious choice.  This Kate made the choice to leave on her own, she could have just said she'll drop the topic.", "Good luck!", "It's possible that she just had a really bad week, or something, but it's also possible that the difference in moral compass was never really tested or made clear.   People change over time.  It happens.   It's also possible that (frankly speaking) she is jealous of your husband getting your attention, instead of her getting it.", "Yes, you definitely owe her for the center pieces then. I\u2019ve made them before for my own and other people\u2019s weddings. It\u2019s expensive and time consuming, even when you\u2019re doing it the cheapest ways possible. I\u2019ll say NTA overall, but I think it would\u2019ve been better to talk about these things and check in with her after she walked away. If she\u2019s done as much as you say she did for this wedding, you at least have owed her that even on your busy day.", "But do you see here in your comment you accused her of doing the exact thing she is accusing you of? Why are you right and she\u2019s wrong? \n\nHer timing was awful but tbh if I had a friend that was concerned for me about my relationship, id want to know.", "I get that Maids of Honor/Best Men have all sorts of traditions that they are supposed to \"do\" on the wedding day depending on how literal/traditional you are taking the role, but the ONE DAMNED THING you need to be is supportive! \n\nI reiterate my ffs.", "So you did tell her to leave LOL. How did you even have a wedding without your maid of honor??", "Got it. \n\nI'm just wondering why you haven't cut her out before, especially when she was being blatantly biphobic toward your partner?\n\nOverall, NTA, but I think this needs to be the nail in the coffin of your friendship. If she shelled out some money for the wedding centre pieces then kick that money back to her and be on your way to wedded bliss.", "It\u2019s possible, but she\u2019s done this in the past, she didn\u2019t really give my husband a chance, she would say she liked him but would constantly be skeptical of him, she\u2019s done it with other men and I know it\u2019s coming from a place of her worrying about me as her friend given my past relationships, but my husband is really a great guy\nI also have a 7 year old from a precious relationship, so after my first toxic relationship with my ex after my child\u2019s father, I really tightened down on my standards and what. I allowed because I have a little one looking up to me", "If she wasn\u2019t doing this from the moment I met my husband I would agree with you", "I had spoken to her about it when it happened and she never did it again, so I thought it was resolved but it apparently wasn\u2019t, we\u2019ve been friends since I was 12, so I think a part of my just always had a soft spot for her and just wanted to be there for her no matter what, but that was clearly the wrong thing to do", ">it\u2019s coming from a place of her worrying about me\n\nThis may very well be be the case, but (*from what little appears here*) it sounds more like she's jealous of the attention that's shifted to your husband.", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by wanting to make your wedding day special for both of you. A try friend would understand that and it\u2019s really concerning that she was getting into your head and questioning your relationship. If that\u2019s happening I would limit contact.\n\nIt\u2019s your relationship and if you and husband are happy that\u2019s the most important thing.", "Fair enough. \n\nMy advice would be take some time, and then when you're ready send her a note just letting her know you can't come back from this, wish her well and send her money for the centre pieces and move along."]}
