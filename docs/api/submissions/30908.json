Neither of you are exactly right or wrong.  She should have just shut up and supported you on your day.  Your relationship isn't hers.  You aren't changing FOR your husband, but because you wanted something and it was for you both.  She doesn't see it that way.  See if you can get together and talk.", "NTA.

She shouldn't have attacked you and should have realized you wanting to cater to him and do the small special things is what love is about. She may have been your friend since 12, but the funny thing about weddings is you only need the bride and groom. So I don't know if you can make up or have a meaningful relationship after this.

I would be showing extraordinary disrespect if I acted like she did on the day of my best friend's wedding. She had years to have this conversation, and you seem to have always given her the same answer, i.e., \"I'm good with him, and you have to trust my judgment.\" On your wedding day, you did the same thing, and she walked away. It was her choice -- not yours -- that mattered to her. I think this implies a number of conclusions about her, but you don't need me running your friend down.  \n\\- In your place, I would reimburse your friend whatever she spent as soon as possible; if you already know how much, great; but you might have to ask her, in which case we'll presume you think she's being honest. This is a good-faith gesture and provides relief for her material grievances.   \n\\- Once that's out of the way, you might have a non-threatening, boundary-setting conversation with her about the first point I mentioned above. Explain that she will have to treat your husband with \\*at least\\* the respect that she'd give you if she expects to be part of your lives.   \n\\- Even if you pay her off, your friend is likely to still feel a certain amount of shame. She knows that you've shared what happened with friends and family who are all judging her now. Based on my own experience, the company of those we've done wrong is seldom comfortable, and that may show. A really deep friendship can survive that, but it's going to take work on both sides.   \n\\- If this relationship ever fails, even if he cheats, you should never think she was right. You don't consider her position rational now, and even if she's broken-clock right after seven years, she still won't have been right to do what she did. And should she ask you to admit she was right, it would confirm the conclusions I mentioned before. Or heck, maybe you'll be the cheater. : /\n\nCongratulations on your marriage, and best of luck!", "NTA you didn\u2019t kick her out at all. You told if she couldn\u2019t be respectful & keep her negative comments to herself then she could leave. It wasn\u2019t a demand, it wasn\u2019t a dressing down, it was a simple request & she decided to be a brat and go pout with the expectation that you would put your special day (which I\u2019m sure cost a small fortune) on hold to placate her tantrum. She is bitter & jealous and now butthurt because you chose your own sanity and happiness instead of putting on the kid gloves & treating her like the sensitive little princess that she is.", "NTA.  The second you told her the day was for both of you, she should have gracefully dropped the argument.  It's super messed up that she was so jazzed about your appearance until you mentioned your husband.  How could she have stomached supporting you at all if this man's presence in your life upsets her so much?  I don't get it.  Just based on past experience, I'm guessing she stuck around because she was waiting for you to come to her to apologize and invite her back to the party.  The fact that she's hung up on you telling her to leave is her completely ignoring the fact that it was her inability to put her (incorrect!) evaluations of your relationship to one side so YOU could enjoy YOUR wedding.\n\nIf it'll make you feel more at peace, sure, pay her for her work on the centerpieces.  Maybe use the opportunity to tell her that her behavior is completely unacceptable and you're just not going to put up with it anymore.  I'm a really big proponent of going into stuff over-prepared, so maybe take a moment to write down some examples...ways she projected onto your relationship, the reality of your relationship, how it made you feel, etc.  Maybe ask her what things are occurring NOW in your relationship that have her concerned, and if she can only say that men are inherently bad people, ask her how you're supposed to ever earn her approval with regards to your love life.  If you want to continue your friendship with her, maybe you outline some pretty strict rules about her behavior.  That awful negativity is draining for everyone involved, her definitely included.", "NTA\n\nShe had a problem with your good relationship so she left.\n\nShe's not friend material.

Flat out wrong. I agree where she was coming from might look like a control thing, but it wasn't. So she was wrong and attacked (yes, verbally attacked) the bride on her wedding day over how the bride wanted to do her hair.", "Imma dissent here because once it became apparent that he is not abusing her, disrespecting her, or mistreating her, she needed to change her narrative. MOH has a relationship issue and she needs to be mature enough to recognize it's HER issue. Not everyone else's. Not everyone has crappy relationshps; some hit the jackpot, some work to make it work. Changing and evolving in your partnership is natural and NORMAL. Wearing a hairstyle your husband likes is not close to 'changing for someone'. Most women like dressing up and looking cute for our partners. We like that positive safe attention. Why shouldn't she wear it in a way they BOTH like? Her going off on such a negative rant, over HAIR, on the wedding day was out of line. No one wants to have someone there who is going to be so outwardly negative about their love. Plus she had the option of keeping her opinions to herself OR leaving. By leaving she declared she was going to actively sow discord at the event just because she could.", "You set a boundary. She decided she couldn't live with it.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, I didn\u2019t have the time nor energy to argue with her about something so pointless, especially when this was a problem I had with her in the past, projecting her shit onto me and I thought we were past it, but I learned this weekend we are not", "OP said, \"if you have a problem you can leave\". Friend completely disrespected and disregarded the relationship by her subsequent choice. NTA, and comments here explaining \"friend's\" viewpoint are pretty generous and not very realistic IMO.", "And she probably would have realized it was a choice if she wasn't so against the husband for *checks notes* liking the wife's hair.", "Thank you.  I think I meant the entire big picture, not the wedding day.  I did say she should have shut up and supported the bride on that day.  In the big picture, however, the friend is coming from a place of concern.", "Yes exactly!! And I\u2019ve tried having this conversation with her a few times, my husband treats me like a queen. Him and his family welcomed my daughter, who was just 4 at the time when i introduced them, with open arms and he treats us both in ways I dreamed of when I was very used to toxicity, I almost self sabotaged the (at the time) prospective relationship because even I had a moment where I projected my past onto him and questioned every good thing he did before I actually gave him a chance", "I am so sorry, I am clearly not communicating well.  I agree that on the wedding day, the MOH was 100% wrong.  There is nothing good that comes from the way she talked to the bride.  My only thought was that her own bad relationship was coloring her views, and that if she wanted to remain friends with this woman, communicating may help her see past that.", "Thats understandable, I am more than willing to pay her for her time and resources for the center pieces, but she also wants me to pay for her dress and the deposit she can\u2019t get back for her makeup she never got done, and for her shoes and everything else that I left to her discretion as well as my brides maids\nLike the dresses, i just picked a color and told them they can do whatever they find affordable, my two bridesmaids found dresses for under $100, she spent $292 on a dress from David\u2019s and wants me to refund that too, I\u2019m just not sure how to go about that part", "Yes, and I can agree with having those concerns for a friend. But being as she was the MoH, my guess is that this isn't the first time she has mentioned her concerns to OP. In fact, her toxicity has been projected since the beginning of OP's relationship. So this isn't giving OP any new info or a new perspective, its literally just stirring the pot.\n\nAnd I don't care how concerned someone is about a friends partner, unless it is new info coming to light and would immediately stop the ceremony, the day of the wedding is NEVER the appropriate time to bring up bullshit that is bugging you.", "Changing your actions because you are living in a new reality is growth and evolution. She was so hurt she can only see hurt. She needs therapy because she is slowly going to isolate herself and think it is protection.", "My bridesmaids stepped up lol", "Nope. No how. You have a clear understanding of what is fair here in this comment. If you want to pay her a reasonable amount for the center pieces that would be fair and probably good for your own conscience. (She probably won't appreciate it but you'll know.) Everything else she spent was on her own choices and for her own benefit, whether or however she chose to use/wear them or not.", "Well, I 100% agree with that too.  I don't know why she would make such an issue of hair on this woman's wedding day, when the bride wanted it like that.", "The problem is she\u2019s still with same man she\u2019s been with for 8 years now\nHe is the definition of incompetence and she\u2019s been talking about the same last chance for 6 of those 8 years and she only opened up to me about their relationship because we lived together and I started witnessing it\nWe always talked about marriage and building a life with our person, she always wanted to finish college and she doesn\u2019t even want those things anymore and I think it\u2019s only because she knows her boyfriend won\u2019t ever provide it for her", "Poor thing is mad everyone else is not as dissatisfied as she is.", "\"I said it was both of our days and if she had s problem with that she could leave.\"\n\nYou didn't tell her to leave. You told her what she needed to do to stay and she wasn't interested in shutting the eff up. She's not your friend and her jealousy over your relationship would have come to a head at some point. If you want to repay her, do so.\n\nEdit: NTA", "\u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t have the time to chase her.. I told her she didn\u2019t have to leave\u2026 \u00bb\nShe was giving you advice and you didn\u2019t take it right and told her to leave. She was giving advice on your hair choices, which you apparently were changing last minute, so I would say advice is needed and from someone\u2019s point of view could be being a good friend/MOH\u2026 As you describe it, the convo was not escalating and you went from zero to \u00ab\u00a0you are not agreeing with me so you are not a good friend, so leave\u00a0\u00bb.\nThe wedding madness is always the excuse for brides to be incredibly ungrateful. If you didn\u2019t like her comment, just say it and move on. But don\u2019t act surprised the morning after if she was not in the wedding when you told her to leave.\nYTA, and yes, you should refund her.", "My partner doesn\u2019t care how I do my hair. But over the years I have learned that he likes to brush my hair out of my face. It\u2019s like a love language for him. \n\n99.9% of the time my hair is up and not anywhere near my face. That how I like it.\n\nBut why would you NOT want to cater to your husbands preferences on your wedding day???? That\u2019s probably the one day he would know my hair was going to be down before he saw me haha.\n\n\n\nThe way you did your hair sounds beautiful! Your friend sounds jealous. If she didn\u2019t want to be kicked out of the wedding, she shouldn\u2019t have shamed you, the groom, the relationship, ect", "Nta she needs a shrink", "YTA kicking MOH out because this verbal dispute ? You made it sound like her choice to leave but from you said in the moment you clearly told her to leave. Her comment might be rude and disrespectful but not in the level of kicking her out of the weddings after all she had done IMO that is the level of asking to cut ties.", "\"altering everything\" She literally just changed her hairstyle\n\n>Did her comments hit a little too close to home?\n\nShe's not allowed to defend her husband on the day of their wedding?", "\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6"]}
