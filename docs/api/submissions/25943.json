She's not going to run around pulling table cloths and stuff you know.", "I wouldn\u2019t get on the plane, there is absolutely no reason for you and baby to travel. I would not sit outside the ceremony, then in another room and have a plate brought out to me, that\u2019s absolutely pointless", "YWNBTA. Just stay home.

Skip the wedding.", "NTA. However, don\u2019t fake sick with anyone. All people will hear from that is that is that your wife came to the wedding despite you not feeling well in the hotel. Which means that anyone who gets sick following this wedding (likely to happen with COVID-19 numbers going up again, travel, an event, etc.) will assume your wife thoughtlessly risked others\u2019 health.\n\n\u201cWe have an 8 month old and couldn\u2019t find appropriate childcare\u201d is a perfectly legitimate excuse.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m confused how you got to this point. Surely you knew the wedding was childfree and had months to figure out a plan (a vetted local sitter, just your wife traveling for the wedding, not attending and sending a large gift, etc.). Did you not know the wedding was childfree until the week prior? Or did you or your wife assume you could show up with baby in tow and they\u2019d figure it out for you? I\u2019m finding it hard to believe that they are responsible for the last minute component of this. \n\nYou aren\u2019t being inconvenienced if they told you it was childfree when they invited you. They are being more than flexible by suggesting that you still get a meal and another room. It\u2019s a childfree wedding, it\u2019s your responsibility to decide if you can or cannot attend and arrange childcare and expecting them to figure out how you can still keep your baby near their venue is absurd. \n\nYour other options (finding a sitter, having your kid watched at the home where other kids are, you staying in the hotel, etc.) are all perfectly reasonable. RSVPing no would have also been an option. So much so that I\u2019m wondering if your wife is the issue since she seems to be rejecting all of these reasonable, non-drama filled options. Is she trying to disrupt the wedding by drawing attention to the fact that you\u2019re in the parking lot? Getting other family to come out and see baby? Getting you and baby invited in? Drawing attention to the fact that it\u2019s childfree/ making it about her? \n\nYou staying at the hotel is a perfectly appropriate and more graceful way to handle it. If the couple getting married complains about you not being at the venue point out that you didn\u2019t want to draw attention to baby in the back room at their wedding since their wedding should be about them.  If they truly wanted a childfree event my guess is they\u2019d be much happier if you and baby weren\u2019t there. I\u2019m guessing their \u201cproposed solution\u201d is in response to your wife saying she can\u2019t leave you and the baby at the hotel for whatever reason. It\u2019s too absurd to be anything else. I think you may need to open yourself up to the possibility that your wife is being difficult and that they are working to accommodate her. I highly doubt they care if baby is left with a sitter or in the hotel with you as opposed to sitting in the parking lot.\n\nIf the whole family is local then someone knows someone who isn\u2019t a \u201crandom stranger.\u201d If the wedding was planned as far in advance as usually happens with these things you\u2019ve had months to make a plan. If I were you I\u2019d be strongly questioning whether the couple getting married is the issue here and not your wife.", "NTA,  that's better than being stuck apart from the rest of the wedding.
