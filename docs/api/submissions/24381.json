We have 3 beautiful children (all under 12) together and I have a early teenage step daughter who is with every other weekend. We are in love, love and adore each other and our family. I work as an executive, she is a SAHM.\n\nSince the birth of our youngest (6 years ago) our love life has suffered terribly, but not for the reasons you think (just kids). Prior to our 6th, we were intimate 4-5 times a week - not necessarily sex, but intimate - and everything was running beautifully. After our youngest was born, 3rd by caesarean, my wife suffered from post-natal depression, which naturally put things on hold. No stress, buckle down and do whatever is needed to support and get sorted. It's happened many times. \n\nHowever things haven't recovered since then. My wife has had a shocking track record with sustained chronic injury and illnesses that have rendered her only partially mobile and unable to work. In the last 4 years, we've made love no more than 5 times. I am currently her carer, taking her to appointments, waiting on her hand and foot when needed, running kids around, doing the household chores while doing 50-ish hours a week for my work, which is excellent for my stage of my career. We have little money, as most of our money is going on here care and anything else we need for the kids (my 8yrd old is autistic).\n\nAs it stands now, pretty much all of my spare effort time and energy is spent on caring for her, the house or the kids. I am lucky if i get an hour a week to spend on myself. And in terms of intimacy, it's just not there. I miss the feeling of another human wanting me for me - not as a carer to take care of another task for them, but someone who sees me and wants me as a person in their life romantically. \n\nI won't leave - it would break her heart. I can't talk to her about it without making her feel like shit and the only thing i get close to intimacy is the odd cuddle in bed - when it doesn't make her uncomfortable - and a kiss good bye in the morning. Other than that, i feel pretty much worthless, undesirable, and useless aside from my ability to provide.\n\nSo, in all of that, WIBTA if i were to find intimacy outside of the relationship, knowing that i would never break up our home? My two very good friends are split and are looking out for me. HELP!\n\n*** edit:\nMany commenters have said 'talk to your wife!' And the answer to that is i've been trying to have a conversation for the last couple of years. The other point is that im not seeking the ok to get sex elsewhere - im weighing the opinions of friends. Yes i'm desperate and lonely and feeling incredibly inloved and unwanted. The intimacy i seek isnt hust sex - otherwise pulling myself would relieve it. I have put myself last in our family for the last few years... and i'm breaking.

But seeking intimacy from someone else is absolutely wrong. YWBTA. \nYou need to talk to your wife. Hard discussions suck, I know,  but you're in a committed relationship and you need to talk to her. \nWill she shut down? Yeah probably, I certainly have. Its human, but you need to have the conversation. Just keep trying to talk to her about it. You're in  partnership, work to keep it together.", "NTA if she agrees to it and you abide by any restrictions. \n\nYTA if you do it without her consent. You made a vow, in sickness and in health, remember?", "YTA. You're not giving your wife a chance to have an opinion on this. You don't want to 'hurt her feelings/make her feel like shit' by bringing up your needs/wants, but you think that she'll be okay when she finds out (and trust me, she'll find out) that you're fucking someone else? All 'for her'? Fucking talk to your wife. She might think that your intimacy desire has waned with hers or that you don't find her attractive. If you haven't brought it up, then how is she supposed to address anything?\n\nWhy are people allergic to communication in a relationship. Talk to her. If you really NEED intimacy and she can't/won't give it to you, then divorce. You don't love her enough if you can't satisfy yourself with masturbation or work out something with her where you have scheduled intimate nights. But you're going to blow everything up in your face if you make excuses for why it's okay to fuck around on her.", "YTA\n\nCheating on your spouse because they are too ill to have sex is a major AH move.", "YWBTA.\n\nThat's not seeking intimacy, it's just cheating. Buy a fleshlight and hug your wife.", "Yes, you would be the asshole.\n\nI'm guessing when you got married you said some kind of vows. Vows aren't really vows if you break them when things get tough. That's kind of the point.", "YWBTA for cheating on your med ridden wife. I don\u2019t know why you tried painting it as something else", "YTA. Well, if you cheat on your wife, you WILL break up your home. You could get caught by your wife, your kids, or all of them. Your affair partners could get pregnant. They might catch feelings for you and vice versa, and then it won't just be about sex anymore. You're in a very difficult situation. But having affairs and keeping your wife in the dark about them will blow up your life.", "This isn\u2019t \u201cfinding intimacy\u201d, it\u2019s just cheating.\n\nIf you want to leave your wife and not be her carer then do that.

I wonder if you might qualify for more aid than you're receiving. \n\nDo you have friends or family who can help with childcare so you can get a proper break? \n\nYou also just need to have some hard conversations with your wife, and you can't take no for an answer. She is trying to avoid the hard talks, but this can't be avoided. Has she been treated for depression or is she only getting medical treatment for her physical issues? \n\nYou can't neglect your own needs like a martyr, but secretly stepping out on her is not the way. Ideally, you can convince her that therapy is necessary. Hopefully marriage counseling as well, because you are in crisis mode, but she is oblivious, choosing not to see or acknowledge it. You have to press this issue.\n\nI know that seems daunting because you're already emotionally exhausted, but you must make time and space to address this with her as soon as you can. You are clearly overwhelmed. Hiding it and allowing her to ignore it is not sustainable. \n\nI'm sympathetic to your situation. It's extremely difficult to juggle everything you're taking on. This is why you have to address it and reach out for more help. There is no shame in admitting you are burnt out and need more from your partner and anyone else who might be able to lend a hand. Don't wait until you are completely depleted and falling apart. Even getting some affection and emotional support from your wife can go a long way to feeling appreciated. \n\nI hope you'll find a way to get her on board with a new plan.

I'm not you and we're not here to judge a consensual dynamic in a relationship (if she agrees to this). I know several married couples who are poly and have more than their primary partners. I also know some who have babies with their secondary. If everyone is aware and they're all consenting, I\"m not one to judge. Your needs matter too and this sounds like you're the breadwinner and caretaker and it's taking a toll on you.

It sucks, it's a shitty situation but she's still supposed to be your partner, if she loves you she'll want you to be happy too (after she gets over her hurt feelings).

I know you think it\u2019d hurt her to talk to her about it, but it\u2019d hurt her even more and crush your family if you just started shagging around or found yourself a fuck buddy. \n\nHonestly, speak to her first and explain how it\u2019s making you feel. If a solution can\u2019t be found, then you need to really examine your situation. Can you continue like this mentally, emotionally and physically? If your family splits, could you find someone to be a caregiver etc? \n\nI know a lot of people are talking about vows in their responses, but put that to the side. How much do you love your wife? Can you imagine life without being married to her? And be honest about that. Then speak to her and see what can be achieved that way.

Massively so. \n\nDid you not make vows to each other during your wedding? In sickness and in health???\n\nThe ONLY way that this would be acceptable is if you spoke to your wife about it and she agreed to letting you seek sexual relations elsewhere. But I seriously doubt that that conversation would go the way you wanted. \n\nSo you've got two options.  Either be kind and caring to your wife and keep the vows you made, or leave her. You can't have it both ways, sorry.", "Wow. Just wow. YTA.", "\nYTA. And after looking through your comments on naked girls posts. Yikes.", "Talk to her. I know this situation sucks for you, but she isnt doing it on purpose. She probably feels undesirable as well, what with the impact the kids made on her and her body. She is not well, she is depressed. \nYou dont have to give yourself up for her but you are a team. Talk. Communicate. See some therapist, both alone and together. Imagine how she is feeling. You think she doesnt know she isnt the same as she was. She knows. And she probably already feels not good enough with all that you do for her. It is not all about you. (Im not saying it is all about her, your feelings absolutely matter and she needs to listen to you too) but what I wanna say is its not you vs her. Its you two against the problem. And the problem is you both feel lost and burned out en not good enough and you lost each other. \n\nGo find eachother again. And the only way to do that is to have some honest talks and to deal with the situation. \n\nYou having sex with someone else will not solve the problem, because it will not bring you closer together.

Cheating destroys families. Never works out well. Talk to your wife. These difficult conversations have to be had.

Your wants and needs matter too", "YTA for reasons plenty of people have outlined. But caretaker burnout is something you should look into. Taking care of some one is hard work, and it's exhausting. You need to find a support system to help take some weight off so you can breathe. Also therapy if you're able to afford it, for both of you.", "YTA but either way the situation sucks. I lost my ability to walk about a year a go exactly. My partner didn't believe I was losing all mobility and needed a wheelchair and constantly asked for sex besides me being in excruciating pain and barely able to lift my legs myself. He dumped me 2 days after my birthday and 2 days before my most intense hospitalization (not my first of the issue and certainly not my last). It sucks for everyone and I was heartbroken and it lead to a lot of hostile interactions. We both felt abandoned and like our needs weren't being met. I felt like he didn't give a shit because he literally works in Healthcare and I took care of him with a serious injury for almost a year and he couldn't handle me for a month. I was cooking for us while in a wheelchair. Im still angry so I apologize for that.\n\nDump her. Do not cheat. It will be better in the long run. Please, honestly is always better. For both of you. But just my opinion as a now chronically ill person who has been abandoned emotionally and physically. So do what you want with that.", "YWBTA broke up with her might break her heart but she will get over it it's better than what you gonna do. Cheating is asshole move and it will not only break your wife heart but your childrens view of you will change forever.

You deserve to have a good sex life she deserves to at least don't have partner who cheats on her.", "YWBTA. no situation excuses cheating. talk to her about it. that the lack of intimacy makes you feel unwanted.", "Kinda YTA ... I get the need for intimacy but I don't agree that you don't talk about your needs and looking for options to create intimacy.\n\nMy advice seek professional help from a therapist who has experience with intimacy issues and chronic illness, they can give you and your wife advice and also giving a safe place to talk", "As this highly depends on how you handle it i won't pass judgement now. \n\nYou are an equal partner in this relationship. Which means that you are also equally important. You have a right to discuss this with your wife. She can't keep shutting down, she needs to hear you out. \n\nI know this is a devastating situation. She probably feels like shit because she can't give you what you want. You feel like shit because she's sick, you don't want to hurt her but still you have some needs. I won't say this will be an easy conversation. And it won't be only one conversation but many. And your marriage might break apart from this. I really hope you guys can find a solution though.\n\n\nHaving an affair (especially as there probably will be emotions involved) has a very high chance of wrecking your marriage. She might find out. You might fall in love and leave her....have you really thought about this? Or are you only talking about sex/hooking up? \n\n\nit's good that you have friends to talk about it. But i think if you are really at the point of thinking about cheating then you need to think about if you really want to stay with your wife, if you think you'll be able to find a solution together or if she'll never be able to talk with you about this (in the end you are the one that knows your wife). But be very gentle about this. The situation isn't easy for you but neither is it for her. How you go about this, the way you say things and express your needs has a huge influence on the chances of finding a solution. I really wish you and your family the best.", "It\u2019s a really difficult situation. I would seek couples therapy first to address the issue in a safe place and see if you can come up with a solution together that is acceptable to you both. Don\u2019t do anything without her knowledge or consent - there\u2019s no coming back from that.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to live as a carer and as someone who needs care. Intimacy matters.

Men are not traditionally caretakers whereas women are the nurturers.\n\nI understand needing intimacy and I can only imagine how hard it is to have her shut down when you talk. If you just wanted a nut, there\u2019s toys and porn for that. But you want intimacy and that is more complicated than just wanting to get off. Say you find a woman who gives you this intimacy\u2026how will you keep yourself from developing feelings for someone who holds you and makes you feel cared for? You can\u2019t. What if the other woman falls in love with you? Will you tell her about your wife? Will she be okay with meeting your emotional, mental, and physical needs when she knows there is no future? \n\nI think it would be less asshole-ish if you just wanted the sex. But you want pillow talk, cuddling, affection, and all the stuff that comes from having a relationship. You\u2019re expecting partner benefits that you\u2019re not getting from your wife. It is not fair to the woman, your wife, or yourself. This is deeper than cheating on a physical level and it will not end well.\n\nPlease talk to your wife. If you have to, write her a letter.

People here have no idea what is involved in being a carer for a spouse, both emotionally and practically. Yes you made vows, yes you promised in sickness and health - but few people have to put that into practice in their 40s and care for a physically incapable person. It is not unreasonable for you to be broken by this. People are focusing on \"oh you just want to get your rocks off\" but actually what you are missing is intimacy and all of the things that have been taken away from your relationship by your wife's illness. I think your post is poorly worded and has centralised sex too much, so people are focusing on that, when actually it's clear that's not really the issue.\n\nI don't think cheating on your wife will provide you with what you need. It doesn't sound like you will have the bandwidth to really forge a relationship with another person. I think you are fantasising about it as a solution when it isn't one. I think you need to demand your wife talk to you. But I don't think you should go into the conversation with the goal of asking her if you can see someone else, I think you should go into it with an attitude of \"lets find a way to make this better together.\" Maybe there are things she can do to make you feel loved that are within her abilities. If she won't talk to you then I would propose couples therapy. If she is completely unwilling to talk to you or work on the relationship, well...", "NAH. I prepare to be downvoted. There isn't anything wrong with wanting intimacy and/or just sex. I don't think it is at all sustainable or fair to say 'just put up and shut up' at your age. That isn't license to cheat, actually I'm not clear what you want because it doesn't sound like just sex, more like a deeper connection. From what you have said your wife likely knows it's an issue (given you had an active sexlife) and is frightened to get into a serious conversation on it. If I was her I would be expecting you to ask to go elsewhere, to ask her to agree to some sort of arrangement. You are going to have to push it with her though to see how she feels (she must miss it as well). Also, if are not already, get clear on what you do want. Do you want license to have an affair? Casual sex? Do you have someone in mind? Or do you actually want an out of thecwhole situation? No bad answers, caring is v challenging and alters your relationship with the person completely. Also, is there any hope of improvement in your wife's condition?", "This should be a big, obvious YTA. Cheating is never acceptable, no matter the circumstances. Never acceptable.

I work as an executive, she is a SAHM.\n\nSince the birth of our youngest (6 years ago) our love life has suffered terribly, but not for the reasons you think (just kids). Prior to our 6th, we were intimate 4-5 times a week - not necessarily sex, but intimate - and everything was running beautifully. After our youngest was born, 3rd by caesarean, my wife suffered from post-natal depression, which naturally put things on hold. No stress, buckle down and do whatever is needed to support and get sorted. It's happened many times. \n\nHowever things haven't recovered since then. My wife has had a shocking track record with sustained chronic injury and illnesses that have rendered her only partially mobile and unable to work. In the last 4 years, we've made love no more than 5 times. I am currently her carer, taking her to appointments, waiting on her hand and foot when needed, running kids around, doing the household chores while doing 50-ish hours a week for my work, which is excellent for my stage of my career. We have little money, as most of our money is going on here care and anything else we need for the kids (my 8yrd old is autistic).\n\nAs it stands now, pretty much all of my spare effort time and energy is spent on caring for her, the house or the kids. I am lucky if i get an hour a week to spend on myself. And in terms of intimacy, it's just not there. I miss the feeling of another human wanting me for me - not as a carer to take care of another task for them, but someone who sees me and wants me as a person in their life romantically. \n\nI won't leave - it would break her heart. I can't talk to her about it without making her feel like shit and the only thing i get close to intimacy is the odd cuddle in bed - when it doesn't make her uncomfortable - and a kiss good bye in the morning. Other than that, i feel pretty much worthless, undesirable, and useless aside from my ability to provide.\n\nSo, in all of that, WIBTA if i were to find intimacy outside of the relationship, knowing that i would never break up our home? My two very good friends are split and are looking out for me. HELP!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
