We have 3 beautiful children (all under 12) together and I have a early teenage step daughter who is with every other weekend. We are in love, love and adore each other and our family. I work as an executive, she is a SAHM.\n\nSince the birth of our youngest (6 years ago) our love life has suffered terribly, but not for the reasons you think (just kids). Prior to our 6th, we were intimate 4-5 times a week - not necessarily sex, but intimate - and everything was running beautifully. After our youngest was born, 3rd by caesarean, my wife suffered from post-natal depression, which naturally put things on hold. No stress, buckle down and do whatever is needed to support and get sorted. It's happened many times. \n\nHowever things haven't recovered since then. My wife has had a shocking track record with sustained chronic injury and illnesses that have rendered her only partially mobile and unable to work. In the last 4 years, we've made love no more than 5 times. I am currently her carer, taking her to appointments, waiting on her hand and foot when needed, running kids around, doing the household chores while doing 50-ish hours a week for my work, which is excellent for my stage of my career. We have little money, as most of our money is going on here care and anything else we need for the kids (my 8yrd old is autistic).\n\nAs it stands now, pretty much all of my spare effort time and energy is spent on caring for her, the house or the kids. I am lucky if i get an hour a week to spend on myself. And in terms of intimacy, it's just not there. I miss the feeling of another human wanting me for me - not as a carer to take care of another task for them, but someone who sees me and wants me as a person in their life romantically. \n\nI won't leave - it would break her heart. I can't talk to her about it without making her feel like shit and the only thing i get close to intimacy is the odd cuddle in bed - when it doesn't make her uncomfortable - and a kiss good bye in the morning. Other than that, i feel pretty much worthless, undesirable, and useless aside from my ability to provide.\n\nSo, in all of that, WIBTA if i were to find intimacy outside of the relationship, knowing that i would never break up our home? My two very good friends are split and are looking out for me. HELP!\n\n*** edit:\nMany commenters have said 'talk to your wife!' And the answer to that is i've been trying to have a conversation for the last couple of years. The other point is that im not seeking the ok to get sex elsewhere - im weighing the opinions of friends. Yes i'm desperate and lonely and feeling incredibly inloved and unwanted. The intimacy i seek isnt hust sex - otherwise pulling myself would relieve it. I have put myself last in our family for the last few years... and i'm breaking.

But seeking intimacy from someone else is absolutely wrong. YWBTA. \nYou need to talk to your wife. Hard discussions suck, I know,  but you're in a committed relationship and you need to talk to her. \nWill she shut down? Yeah probably, I certainly have. Its human, but you need to have the conversation. Just keep trying to talk to her about it. You're in  partnership, work to keep it together.", "NTA if she agrees to it and you abide by any restrictions. \n\nYTA if you do it without her consent. You made a vow, in sickness and in health, remember?", "YTA. You're not giving your wife a chance to have an opinion on this. You don't want to 'hurt her feelings/make her feel like shit' by bringing up your needs/wants, but you think that she'll be okay when she finds out (and trust me, she'll find out) that you're fucking someone else? All 'for her'? Fucking talk to your wife. She might think that your intimacy desire has waned with hers or that you don't find her attractive. If you haven't brought it up, then how is she supposed to address anything?\n\nWhy are people allergic to communication in a relationship. Talk to her. If you really NEED intimacy and she can't/won't give it to you, then divorce. You don't love her enough if you can't satisfy yourself with masturbation or work out something with her where you have scheduled intimate nights. But you're going to blow everything up in your face if you make excuses for why it's okay to fuck around on her.", "YTA\n\nCheating on your spouse because they are too ill to have sex is a major AH move.", "YWBTA.\n\nThat's not seeking intimacy, it's just cheating. Buy a fleshlight and hug your wife.", "Yes, you would be the asshole.\n\nI'm guessing when you got married you said some kind of vows. Vows aren't really vows if you break them when things get tough. That's kind of the point.", "YWBTA for cheating on your med ridden wife. I don\u2019t know why you tried painting it as something else", "YTA. Well, if you cheat on your wife, you WILL break up your home. You could get caught by your wife, your kids, or all of them. Your affair partners could get pregnant. They might catch feelings for you and vice versa, and then it won't just be about sex anymore. You're in a very difficult situation. But having affairs and keeping your wife in the dark about them will blow up your life.", "This isn\u2019t \u201cfinding intimacy\u201d, it\u2019s just cheating.\n\nIf you want to leave your wife and not be her carer then do that.

I wonder if you might qualify for more aid than you're receiving. \n\nDo you have friends or family who can help with childcare so you can get a proper break? \n\nYou also just need to have some hard conversations with your wife, and you can't take no for an answer. She is trying to avoid the hard talks, but this can't be avoided. Has she been treated for depression or is she only getting medical treatment for her physical issues? \n\nYou can't neglect your own needs like a martyr, but secretly stepping out on her is not the way. Ideally, you can convince her that therapy is necessary. Hopefully marriage counseling as well, because you are in crisis mode, but she is oblivious, choosing not to see or acknowledge it. You have to press this issue.\n\nI know that seems daunting because you're already emotionally exhausted, but you must make time and space to address this with her as soon as you can. You are clearly overwhelmed. Hiding it and allowing her to ignore it is not sustainable. \n\nI'm sympathetic to your situation. It's extremely difficult to juggle everything you're taking on. This is why you have to address it and reach out for more help. There is no shame in admitting you are burnt out and need more from your partner and anyone else who might be able to lend a hand. Don't wait until you are completely depleted and falling apart. Even getting some affection and emotional support from your wife can go a long way to feeling appreciated. \n\nI hope you'll find a way to get her on board with a new plan.

I'm not you and we're not here to judge a consensual dynamic in a relationship (if she agrees to this). I know several married couples who are poly and have more than their primary partners. I also know some who have babies with their secondary. If everyone is aware and they're all consenting, I\"m not one to judge. Your needs matter too and this sounds like you're the breadwinner and caretaker and it's taking a toll on you.

It sucks, it's a shitty situation but she's still supposed to be your partner, if she loves you she'll want you to be happy too (after she gets over her hurt feelings).

I know you think it\u2019d hurt her to talk to her about it, but it\u2019d hurt her even more and crush your family if you just started shagging around or found yourself a fuck buddy. \n\nHonestly, speak to her first and explain how it\u2019s making you feel. If a solution can\u2019t be found, then you need to really examine your situation. Can you continue like this mentally, emotionally and physically? If your family splits, could you find someone to be a caregiver etc? \n\nI know a lot of people are talking about vows in their responses, but put that to the side. How much do you love your wife? Can you imagine life without being married to her? And be honest about that. Then speak to her and see what can be achieved that way.

Massively so. \n\nDid you not make vows to each other during your wedding? In sickness and in health???\n\nThe ONLY way that this would be acceptable is if you spoke to your wife about it and she agreed to letting you seek sexual relations elsewhere. But I seriously doubt that that conversation would go the way you wanted. \n\nSo you've got two options.  Either be kind and caring to your wife and keep the vows you made, or leave her. You can't have it both ways, sorry.", "Wow. Just wow. YTA.", "\nYTA. And after looking through your comments on naked girls posts. Yikes.", "Talk to her. I know this situation sucks for you, but she isnt doing it on purpose. She probably feels undesirable as well, what with the impact the kids made on her and her body. She is not well, she is depressed. \nYou dont have to give yourself up for her but you are a team. Talk. Communicate. See some therapist, both alone and together. Imagine how she is feeling. You think she doesnt know she isnt the same as she was. She knows. And she probably already feels not good enough with all that you do for her. It is not all about you. (Im not saying it is all about her, your feelings absolutely matter and she needs to listen to you too) but what I wanna say is its not you vs her. Its you two against the problem. And the problem is you both feel lost and burned out en not good enough and you lost each other. \n\nGo find eachother again. And the only way to do that is to have some honest talks and to deal with the situation. \n\nYou having sex with someone else will not solve the problem, because it will not bring you closer together.

Cheating destroys families. Never works out well. Talk to your wife. These difficult conversations have to be had.

Your wants and needs matter too", "YTA for reasons plenty of people have outlined. But caretaker burnout is something you should look into. Taking care of some one is hard work, and it's exhausting. You need to find a support system to help take some weight off so you can breathe. Also therapy if you're able to afford it, for both of you.", "YTA but either way the situation sucks. I lost my ability to walk about a year a go exactly. My partner didn't believe I was losing all mobility and needed a wheelchair and constantly asked for sex besides me being in excruciating pain and barely able to lift my legs myself. He dumped me 2 days after my birthday and 2 days before my most intense hospitalization (not my first of the issue and certainly not my last). It sucks for everyone and I was heartbroken and it lead to a lot of hostile interactions. We both felt abandoned and like our needs weren't being met. I felt like he didn't give a shit because he literally works in Healthcare and I took care of him with a serious injury for almost a year and he couldn't handle me for a month. I was cooking for us while in a wheelchair. Im still angry so I apologize for that.\n\nDump her. Do not cheat. It will be better in the long run. Please, honestly is always better. For both of you. But just my opinion as a now chronically ill person who has been abandoned emotionally and physically. So do what you want with that.", "YWBTA broke up with her might break her heart but she will get over it it's better than what you gonna do. Cheating is asshole move and it will not only break your wife heart but your childrens view of you will change forever.

You deserve to have a good sex life she deserves to at least don't have partner who cheats on her.", "YWBTA. no situation excuses cheating. talk to her about it. that the lack of intimacy makes you feel unwanted.", "Kinda YTA ... I get the need for intimacy but I don't agree that you don't talk about your needs and looking for options to create intimacy.\n\nMy advice seek professional help from a therapist who has experience with intimacy issues and chronic illness, they can give you and your wife advice and also giving a safe place to talk", "As this highly depends on how you handle it i won't pass judgement now. \n\nYou are an equal partner in this relationship. Which means that you are also equally important. You have a right to discuss this with your wife. She can't keep shutting down, she needs to hear you out. \n\nI know this is a devastating situation. She probably feels like shit because she can't give you what you want. You feel like shit because she's sick, you don't want to hurt her but still you have some needs. I won't say this will be an easy conversation. And it won't be only one conversation but many. And your marriage might break apart from this. I really hope you guys can find a solution though.\n\n\nHaving an affair (especially as there probably will be emotions involved) has a very high chance of wrecking your marriage. She might find out. You might fall in love and leave her....have you really thought about this? Or are you only talking about sex/hooking up? \n\n\nit's good that you have friends to talk about it. But i think if you are really at the point of thinking about cheating then you need to think about if you really want to stay with your wife, if you think you'll be able to find a solution together or if she'll never be able to talk with you about this (in the end you are the one that knows your wife). But be very gentle about this. The situation isn't easy for you but neither is it for her. How you go about this, the way you say things and express your needs has a huge influence on the chances of finding a solution. I really wish you and your family the best.", "It\u2019s a really difficult situation. I would seek couples therapy first to address the issue in a safe place and see if you can come up with a solution together that is acceptable to you both. Don\u2019t do anything without her knowledge or consent - there\u2019s no coming back from that.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to live as a carer and as someone who needs care. Intimacy matters.

Men are not traditionally caretakers whereas women are the nurturers.\n\nI understand needing intimacy and I can only imagine how hard it is to have her shut down when you talk. If you just wanted a nut, there\u2019s toys and porn for that. But you want intimacy and that is more complicated than just wanting to get off. Say you find a woman who gives you this intimacy\u2026how will you keep yourself from developing feelings for someone who holds you and makes you feel cared for? You can\u2019t. What if the other woman falls in love with you? Will you tell her about your wife? Will she be okay with meeting your emotional, mental, and physical needs when she knows there is no future? \n\nI think it would be less asshole-ish if you just wanted the sex. But you want pillow talk, cuddling, affection, and all the stuff that comes from having a relationship. You\u2019re expecting partner benefits that you\u2019re not getting from your wife. It is not fair to the woman, your wife, or yourself. This is deeper than cheating on a physical level and it will not end well.\n\nPlease talk to your wife. If you have to, write her a letter.

People here have no idea what is involved in being a carer for a spouse, both emotionally and practically. Yes you made vows, yes you promised in sickness and health - but few people have to put that into practice in their 40s and care for a physically incapable person. It is not unreasonable for you to be broken by this. People are focusing on \"oh you just want to get your rocks off\" but actually what you are missing is intimacy and all of the things that have been taken away from your relationship by your wife's illness. I think your post is poorly worded and has centralised sex too much, so people are focusing on that, when actually it's clear that's not really the issue.\n\nI don't think cheating on your wife will provide you with what you need. It doesn't sound like you will have the bandwidth to really forge a relationship with another person. I think you are fantasising about it as a solution when it isn't one. I think you need to demand your wife talk to you. But I don't think you should go into the conversation with the goal of asking her if you can see someone else, I think you should go into it with an attitude of \"lets find a way to make this better together.\" Maybe there are things she can do to make you feel loved that are within her abilities. If she won't talk to you then I would propose couples therapy. If she is completely unwilling to talk to you or work on the relationship, well...", "NAH. I prepare to be downvoted. There isn't anything wrong with wanting intimacy and/or just sex. I don't think it is at all sustainable or fair to say 'just put up and shut up' at your age. That isn't license to cheat, actually I'm not clear what you want because it doesn't sound like just sex, more like a deeper connection. From what you have said your wife likely knows it's an issue (given you had an active sexlife) and is frightened to get into a serious conversation on it. If I was her I would be expecting you to ask to go elsewhere, to ask her to agree to some sort of arrangement. You are going to have to push it with her though to see how she feels (she must miss it as well). Also, if are not already, get clear on what you do want. Do you want license to have an affair? Casual sex? Do you have someone in mind? Or do you actually want an out of thecwhole situation? No bad answers, caring is v challenging and alters your relationship with the person completely. Also, is there any hope of improvement in your wife's condition?", "This should be a big, obvious YTA. Cheating is never acceptable, no matter the circumstances. Never acceptable.

I work as an executive, she is a SAHM.\n\nSince the birth of our youngest (6 years ago) our love life has suffered terribly, but not for the reasons you think (just kids). Prior to our 6th, we were intimate 4-5 times a week - not necessarily sex, but intimate - and everything was running beautifully. After our youngest was born, 3rd by caesarean, my wife suffered from post-natal depression, which naturally put things on hold. No stress, buckle down and do whatever is needed to support and get sorted. It's happened many times. \n\nHowever things haven't recovered since then. My wife has had a shocking track record with sustained chronic injury and illnesses that have rendered her only partially mobile and unable to work. In the last 4 years, we've made love no more than 5 times. I am currently her carer, taking her to appointments, waiting on her hand and foot when needed, running kids around, doing the household chores while doing 50-ish hours a week for my work, which is excellent for my stage of my career. We have little money, as most of our money is going on here care and anything else we need for the kids (my 8yrd old is autistic).\n\nAs it stands now, pretty much all of my spare effort time and energy is spent on caring for her, the house or the kids. I am lucky if i get an hour a week to spend on myself. And in terms of intimacy, it's just not there. I miss the feeling of another human wanting me for me - not as a carer to take care of another task for them, but someone who sees me and wants me as a person in their life romantically. \n\nI won't leave - it would break her heart. I can't talk to her about it without making her feel like shit and the only thing i get close to intimacy is the odd cuddle in bed - when it doesn't make her uncomfortable - and a kiss good bye in the morning. Other than that, i feel pretty much worthless, undesirable, and useless aside from my ability to provide.\n\nSo, in all of that, WIBTA if i were to find intimacy outside of the relationship, knowing that i would never break up our home? My two very good friends are split and are looking out for me. HELP!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Rebuilding your couple's dynamic by some one on one activities. There are many spicy romance novels that you could read together or listen the audiobook to together in bed without having sex. Slowly bringing some touch and more from time to time. It may take more than it used to to turn on your wife, these books are well written and it can help her focus on listening to you read or the audiobook. And even before the spicy books, I would think about taking some time to reconnect with her as a person, because I can guarantee she sometimes feels like she lost her entire individuality and feels she is only sick and in pain. Playing some board games, card games can be a fun way to do something together that brings both your mind away from the daily life. You'll laugh together and it'll feel good.\n\nMany things could be done before discussing the possibility of opening your marriage. But the context of couple's therapy could help you naviguate the process and not hurting your wife's feeling by saying things wrong. \n\nI would recommend doing some other reading about disability as well.  It can help you understand the things that can go on in her head and all the things she has to face that she won't talk to you about since she's probably feeling like she puts enough on your shoulders. I'd recommend to read as well about your role as a carer (carer's burnout is a real thing that you should be careful of). \n\nSome patients associations provide some support group for carers as well as for patients. \n\nJust don't do anything behind her back, you could hurt everyone irreversably. I think it would be a big jump to talk with her about opening your marriage before you even work on things together. \n\nIf my husband came to me telling me something like : \"Hey, things have been hard for us in the last years and our dynamic has had to change through it all.

My uncle, her husband, was a MD and a damn good one. Took care of her, did all house chores, cooked etc. One summer day, during a dinner he confided in me and said \" I cannot even touch her because every time I do she responds with a painful sigh or\" don't touch me it hurts.\" Makes me feel like a vicious animal and I hate that feeling so I stopped touching her. She then started complaining about why we don't have sex anymore but I just can't seek my own pleasure knowing it's giving her immense pain. This went on for yrs. No sex, full workload on me along with her care. At one point I observed that she got too comfortable. She stopped doing things I know, as a doctor, that she is able to do. She claimed even holding a napkin hurt  but was able to hold a wine glass every night and host parties. She was happy, had no complaints, had a full time maid, loved the luxurious life I gave her but she never once asked me how I was feeling or what I needed. Being deprioritized in a relationship with an ill person is understandable but being constantly deprioritized is hard! So, I went elsewhere and started a casual relationship with a nurse I work with. It was glorious and felt like myself again. After many yrs I was finally doing something for myself with someone who concentrated on us and didn't bring on any burdens. I loved touching a woman who reciprocated with enthusiasm and desire. That said, I will never leave your aunt but I need you to know that the caretaker suffers as much as the ill. If she knew, she'd throw a fit and maybe divorce me but not once asking me how I have been doing all these years or what led me to do it. I chose to be the cheating villain of my story and I'll take full responsibility if it comes to that but I will not apologize for wanting to feel valued and good again.\"\n\nI did not judge or scold him for cheating but told him his secret was safe with me and it still is although my aunt died 10 yrs ago.

You do the chores, you earn the money, you take care of the kids and you take care of her but you don't have time to take care of you.\n\nYou married each other's, set up vows to be there in health and sickness. For the past years you've been doing just that.\nThe thing is, vows are a two way street, if you've been supportive, taken care of her, taken care of everything and she doesn't make you feel appreciated for this....\n\nI don't talk about her doing anything like chores or else but showing appreciation, showing love, make you feel good about what you do. If she can't respect some part of her vows because of injuries then that's okay, if she just don't do her part on the emotional side then you're not at fault for her behaviour.\n\nYou also have to understand that she might already do her utmost to show you support and love but sometimes, even if both parties do their best it's still not enough. You have the right to feel that way.\n\nNow onto the delicate part, should you be allowed to seek outside help for your needs? Well first of all is your wife conscious of everything? If yes does she do her best? If yes, then I'll be honest you would be, in my opinion, the AH if you still went trough, even with her blessing.\n\nIf she doesn't do her best, or if she does just part of what she is capable of doing and take a much lighter burden than what she could handle when carrying a family and she let you do all the work while watching and not acting then no, you would not in my opinion. People here are for some reason fixated on the vows.\n\nIf she respect her part of the vows to the fullest of her capability then you should too, to the fullest, to the end. It's your wife, the one you chose to marry and have a family with.\nIf she respect that and follow her vows and put as much works in it as she possibly can then I think that you should do the same.\n\nIf not, if she just let you do all the work then why should you follow your vow to the death?

If not worse. It seems to be quite common.\n\nMaybe not short term but over prolonged periods the effort their partner or family puts into caring for them becomes the norm and expected. It's no longer special at a certain point for a lot of people. But the person caring and trying to keep everything else in life going keeps sinking further and further into care fatigue, as the amount of work never gets less both physical and emotional. And when that gets no thanks you see it destroy people's souls over time.\n\nHappens all the time with old relatives as someone that's spent a lot of time caring. People want to look after their relatives at home rather than putting them in a care home but reduced mental capacity makes their older relatives exceptionally hard work and eventually less able to empathise with their helpers. In my experience most people don't make it a year before the relationship has degraded way more than if an outside person was the carer instead.\n\nSame thing goes for depressed people that are sick or need help. If they are to overwhelmed to cope then their empathy and consideration for others drops, as its easier to have someone else handle everything when you can't manage yourself. But obviously the whole time you're having it easier it's because they are putting in so much effort for you at their expense and it isn't sustainable forever. \n\nIsn't any excuse to cheat. But it's a perfectly valid reason to break up if the partner in need of help won't go to therapy with you and try to improve. If they won't even talk about it etc. Care fatigue is absolutely exhausting and in a way I am glad nearly all my family are dead as I don't think I'd be able to give as much of my love and attention as I used to.

He wanted the cuddles and in jokes and feeling masculine in response to her specifically.  It wasn't about ejaculating, he wanted to be truly intimate with her.  \n\nAnyhow, they were still in limbo when I moved on.  But if I could have given them any gift, it would have been recognizing his work as a caregiver with burnout symptoms.  Finding him some respite, or hiring a house cleaner to come do the toilets, or someone else to do half the medical appointments.  \n\nAnd though we absolutely never talked frankly about the nuts and bolts, if it were a friend I would advise trying to find a way to masturbate together in the bed, as something less athletic/ painful but still bonding.", "If you can afford it, hire someone to help you with her care.", "Are you sure?

It's also possible that she also really misses the intimatcy, but just can't do it with her health struggle.\n\nAnd if she *IS* feeling that guilt over not being able to make him happy, all while he's sacrificing himself for her, even if she's opened to it, the agreement will be from a place of knowing that she can't be enough for him right now.

Compliment that woman daily, even if its the smallest mention of her hair, her eyes, the reason you fell in love with her. Surely that's not too hard considering the naked women of the internet are easy to compliment. If this \"intimacy\" isn't just about sex then take it slow with her if you get the chance to cuddle. Like, fuck dude, sit down and talk with her. Watch TV together, discuss random bullshit with her. Before I get hit with \"You don't think I've tried?\" Well maybe you have, but she's obviously in dire need of your support whether it makes you feel like a carer or not.

Your need to be intimate is primal, and absolutely real, nothing to be pooh-poohed away.\n\nThat said, if you are so starved for it, you will find that you will fall for the other woman. Even if you try for a \"purely-sex\" situation, it will happen, because your wife will not be able to \"compete\" that way. And then you will want to break up, and all the heartbreak that follows, specifically about the betrayal she'll feel.\n\nSo please consider that.

It\u2019s so easy to slip into complacency with it. If you have anyone who can watch your kids for a little while, maybe you could go out on a date night so you could have some time to just be a couple. \n\nAs for approaching it with her, my best advice would be to go in making it clear that you don\u2019t blame her and know it\u2019s not her fault, but you miss her, miss having those moments of intimacy with her. Maybe make a conscious effort to set out time for you two, even if it\u2019s having a cuddle on the sofa watching a film, or sitting together to have a meal and reconnect. I know from experience that when I felt internal pressure (like if we would say \u201cwe\u2019re going to be intimate tonight\u201d) I\u2019d totally shut down, but when it happened organically, it was totally fine. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this helps, apologies if it seems a little disjointed!

Being starved of true intimacy is horrible in a relationship, and the kids will see it. Try to talk to your wife, and I truly advice you to involve professionals in that talk, but if she refuses to engage in any type of therapy to fix this, think of yourself and what kind of father you want to be to your kids. Do you want to be unhappy, exhausted and showing them that this is a good relationship? This is how good partnership looks like? They should exhaust themselves for their partner? Or expect their partner to be unhappy and exhaust themselves for their benefit?\n\nYou can love someone dearly but still come to the decision to end a relationship because it is not good for either of you anymore.

Cheat on her and wait for her to find out? \n\n\nReach his breaking point and drop a divorce on his chronically ill wife? \n\nIgnore his feelings until his life becomes so miserable that he contemplates suicide? \n\nYou tell me a better solution then, I'm all ears", "Don't delude yourself.

Can I tell you a story? \n\nI cheated 16 years ago but the relationship was already ending at that point. My ex was all kinds of abusive and he would insult my body and withhold sex for months at a time as punishment. He would tell me I was stupid. My self worth was in the toilet. One day, I connected with an old classmate on social media. He was a law student and very handsome. He made me feel pretty and desired again. We hooked up and it was actually terrible. It was less about sex and more about getting my humanity back. Did I get caught? No. Did it work out with the fling? Also no. But I realized that what I truly needed - affection, kindness, compassion - my ex would never give me. So I left.\n\nYour situation is a bit different, I\u2019ll give you that. You have a woman who loves you, who has given you four children. If I had a partner who loved me like that, I wouldn\u2019t have cheated. I have never been in love. I have never found someone to have children with. I would give anything to have a family. I\u2019m single af right now and I can sleep around and date multiple people if I really wanted but casual sex is not what I desire. It makes me feel lonelier. There is one person who is different, who I have loved for eight years and who got back in touch during the past year. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough. For the first time, I don\u2019t care about going on dates. I\u2019ve actually never been celibate this long. He is the person I want to be with and I see no point in putting in the effort to go back to dating apps. We chat every day. Hundreds of messages and we\u2019ve only hung out three times in one year. This might sound lame, but I prefer messaging him all day and video chatting to getting action.\n\nIn some ways, our situations are reversed. The grass always does seem greener on the other side. I just wanted to share my perspective and give you some food for thought.", "YTA", "Talk about generalizations.", "Oh I was being facetious. The post I'm replying to seems to think there's no way a man could cheat because of emotional needs, it HAS to be sex."]}
