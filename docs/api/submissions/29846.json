As it happens my brother-in-law's 9 year old son lives about 2 hours from where we staying and it was in the same direction as our road trip back home. My husband's brother asked him to ask me if I could pick up his son on our way back to town to save him from his bi-weekly drive.\n\nI considered saying yes but in the end declined for a few reasons. The main one being it would delay our drive by several hours as we would had to wait until 2.30pm (when he finishes school) to drive the last 7 hours of the trip meaning the earliest I could have gotten home would have been 10pm. We originally planned to start our road trip at 8am so we could get home around 6/7pm.\n\nWhen I got home my husband seemed a little off with me. After our son went to bed we got into a fight where he basically called me selfish for not picking up his nephew and making his brother drive all day when I could have done something nice for him my simply swinging by.\n\nIn my opinion it's not that simple and I don't think I should have anything to do with my BIL's custody schedule. It's his own fault he now has to drive 18 hours every other week to see his son. The mom is just some random girl he got pregnant, he has 2 older sons that also don't live with him, and 2 more kids with his current girlfriend. The whole situation is a mess of his own making.

Since it's such an easy thing to do, and would help out his brother, your husband can do it.\n\nIt's absolutely not okay for him to expect seven people to wait around several hours to pick this kid up.", "NTA. With a 1, 3, and 4 yo already in the mix, adding time and shifting everything much later is a pretty darn big deal (or at least I know it would have been with my kids at those ages). It was definitely not as easy as \u201cswinging by.\u201d If you could have taken him out of school early, I would have thought differently. \n\nBut, also, while you may have animosity towards this brother-in-law, that\u2019s YOUR nephew, too. You might want to shift your language around BIL\u2019s \u201cmess\u201d when it comes to the kids specifically so you aren\u2019t blaming them for their father\u2019s actions.", "Nta.

Sounds like you don\u2019t have much of a relationship with your nephew how would he feel about getting in a car with almost strangers?", "You were asked by your husband to do something nice for his brother. You said No. Perfectly normal answer. Doesn\u2019t mean people will like the answer. You had a plan & made a decision. It was your choice. Your husband was disappointed. Seems reasonable. \n\nSounds like your husband likes his brother & nephew \u2026 appears you don\u2019t. Perhaps that\u2019s the bigger problem. \n\nNTA \u2014 but don\u2019t think this is actually about picking up nephew", "The thing that\u2019s sticking out for me here is the way you keep calling him your husband\u2019s nephew. I\u2019ve never once thought of my partner\u2019s siblings\u2019 kids as their nephews and nieces and not mine. If you found this favour to be that big of an ask, then fine. But maybe your husband is also reacting to your general attitude toward \u201chis\u201d nephew.", "Just because your brother-in-law's life is a shit show doesn't mean you have to fix it. And this wasn't a simple \"swing by.\"\n\nIf the kid could have skipped school and be ready to go at 8am that would have been one thing.

What did your husband and his brother think you were supposed to do for 4+ hours while waiting for the kid? Particularly with 3 littles? That kind of delay adds more than just travel time.
