What did your husband and his brother think you were supposed to do for 4+ hours while waiting for the kid? Particularly with 3 littles? That kind of delay adds more than just travel time. You have to add in Neal breaks and increased potty stops too.", "It kind of sounds like this isn\u2019t someone who is close with Opie in their family. I have a cousin who has children I consider nieces and nephews, but he also has two kids with someone random who I have seen twice.

It's not your kid, your BIL doesn't even like you. If your husband cared so much, he can make the drive", "NTA please call your husband an ah on My account.\n\nYou weren't ALONE You had both your child and other family with you and you sure as heck would have been at least extremely rude to make all of them wait for your husband s brother to put HIS RESPONSIBILITY on YOU.\n\nYou did what you should have, if you were alone maybe but as is heck no NTA", "I would have pointed out the logistics and asked BIL if he was willing to pay for at least two hotel rooms (or maybe a joint duo) because there was no way I was going to start at 8am, wait around for a couple of hours for school out, and continue on home to arrive after 10pm.\n\nThat probably would have taken care of the asking by BIL.\n\nAs for your husband, point out that you don't do favors for irresponsible people who don't like you at all.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nOP\u2019s husband is being short sighted, that little stop over would have  affected  at 7 people .

Who the heck is he to volunteer your time and that of anyone else you were traveling with? AND his brother doesn't like you? Shiiiiitt! I would have a hard time delaying my trip for someone I like by that amount of time for someone who has made a point of their dislike for me I would have said no before hubs finished the question.", "NTA. It\u2019s simple for your husband and his brother, because they don\u2019t have to do it. The trouble it takes for BIL to get his child, is easier than you having to go out of your way to pick up another kid to add to your workload of managing them for hours. Why didn\u2019t your husband pick up his nephew?", "NTA. \n1. Is there even room in your vehicle for your nephew? Your car already had 7 including you, your family and luggage. \n2. What were you meant to do for the several hours waiting for your nephew to get out of school? \n3. Were you meant to pick your nephew up from school? If so would the school even let you? \n4. If you aren\u2019t picking your nephew up from school, would his mother be happy for you to even pick him up? If you are a relative stranger both your nephew and his mother would be uncomfortable. \n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as just going past and getting him.", "NTA. it wasn't practical for you to pick him up, your husband is mad because it makes  HIM look bad in his brothers eyes. But I'm old school I ALWAYS stand strong with my wife.", "NTA  \nHindsight is 20-20. You should have said that you were leaving at 8 and would be in his area at 10 (or whatever) and if BIL could have his son at a designated spot (rest stop, place right off the highway, etc) that you would be happy to have him ride along.   \nEither he would have the kid there or not but you made the offer without agreeing to screw up your schedule or really go out of your way.", "NTA", "Info:  Did you ask if the nephew could leave school early to accommodate your travel plans ?", "A few hours of waiting to save him an 18 hour trip? Honestly it's not a huge ask as a one off. You've made it clear in your reasoning here that you chose not to less for the inconvenience to you and more because you don't *like* the dad and don't *want* to help him.\n\nSo honestly I do think it's a bit of an A move. Not enough for me to vote that way officially, but why not help out your spouse's family as a one off? Kind of conceited to imply you would have helped if he had \"pretended to like you\" previously. As long as he wasn't an outright ass it's okay to be indifferent.", "YTA. And you come across like a really unlikable person.", "NTA", "Info: OP, did you ask if you could pick him up early?\nAnd were you and the crew you listed all on one vehicle, or just all on the same trip?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't the asshole for asking. But your husband is a total asshole for not accepting your refusal.", "NTA You were responsible for the safety of your passengers and delaying would have made you too tired to drive safely. We do what we can. We don't rush our lives and the lives of our children. We just don't.", "NTA- period.", "If it hadn't been so inconvenient \u2013 if they wouldn't have had to change their schedule so significantly, and it really would have meant just going a couple of miles out of their way to pick him up (because, obviously, the kid wouldn't be standing on the shoulder of the highway waiting for them) \u2013 I'd think OP was TA for refusing, but this would have been a major inconvenience. And it's one thing to decide to put up with major inconvenience for someone you love, and something else entirely when it's for someone who doesn't like you and doesn\u2019t treat you well. So OP is NTA on that score. \n\nBut OP *is* an AH for the \"his nephew\" crap; she's married to her husband, so his nephew is *her* nephew, too. Besides, we have no indication that the kid has done anything to OP, so it's pretty rotten to transfer her dislike of her BIL onto his children.", "Not just getting in the car with potential strangers, but spending 7 hours in the car with potential strangers.\n\nAnd does OP have a relationship with the kid\u2019s mom? If my hypothetical kid was to spend that much time in a car with someone I don\u2019t know, I would be uncomfortable and wouldn\u2019t blame OP for not wanting to pick up this random kid.", "That was my first thought - did OP even have enough seat belts and car seat room for another child?", "Agreed. I feel for the little kid. \u201cDad didn\u2019t even want to get me\u201d:(", "Especially if OP expects husband to drop everything for her family.", "I've been married almost 30 years. My husband's nieces and nephews don't call me aunt. They are loving and caring towards me, and I treat them as my own, but they're still my husband's relatives and that's the way everybody likes it.", "This!! I have a nephew & niece through my two brothers who got together with women who already had a baby, so they are not biologically related to me but they are, and always have been, family.  \n\nSo much so that when my mum got breast cancer we advised all the nieces to get checked, because genetics.  Didn\u2019t occur to me until a long time later that one of them wasn\u2019t genetically related.", "What a petty bit of minutiae to focus on when OP provided plenty of valid reasons for her decision.\n\nYou were just looking for a reason to castigate her, weren't you?\n\nReposted without the *incivility*.", "100%.", "[removed]", "So do you.", "Depends, if OP's BIL doesn't even like her, has a barely  tolerant relationship with him, and if she has no relationship with said nephew I can see why she would refer to the child as \" husband's nephew\". \n\nI do wonder though what the nephew's mom thought of this situation. If BIL only sees the kid every 2 weeks and he wasn't even in a serious relationship with mom, sounds like she's not close to his family. If that's the case I would definitely not let OP pick up my kid, related by marriage or not, also it would show a lack of effort on BIL's part in regards to visitation.", "You\u2019re assuming she has a relationship with the nephew, but judging by her language she probably doesn\u2019t.", "If she did it once, it might be minutiae, but she refers to him as his nephew throughout.

Do they not matter to your husband? Only his irresponsible brother that you don't get along with, I guess.

I wouldn't want to take an unknown 9 year old on a 7 hour car trip with 8 people packed into the vehicle. \n\nTell your husband to go get him.", "NTA.  Even if you adored your BIL, you would have gotten home 4 hours later than intended had you picked up your nephew, and it still would  have been a no.", "YTA. First of all, he\u2019s your nephew too, not just your husband\u2019s nephew. It wouldn\u2019t have been that much of an inconvenience for you, considering that in your own post you said it was on the way home in the direction you were going.\n\nIt would have given you and your son a chance spend some time with his cousin.

NTA for clearly mutual feelings of indifference to disdain over the BIL. However- it irks me for some reason that you don\u2019t consider that little boy YOUR nephew. Which he is, for the record. I hope when you do see that kid you treat him as one of the family, he\u2019s not responsible for the messy situation he was born into and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d just love to know and have a relationship with your kids- his cousins.", "To be clear, you keep saying your husband's nephew, but he is your nephew too correct?", "YTA.\n\nYes,  you are an AH.", "NTA for not picking him up as traveling with kids is rough but YTA for saying his nephew.

You write like you believe doing minimally nice things for family is alien to you. I get how your husband is seeing this. Not many people love the discovery that they are married to selfish people who don\u2019t like the slightest bit of inconvenience in their lives.
