I honestly can't fathom wanting your child to witness their parent in pain just for them to see the \"miracle of birth\". That's extremely traumatizing for a child.\n\nYou were honest with them about the experience. They needed to know it isn't all sunshine and daisies for the child experiencing this.", "NTA. They made an incorrect assumption about an experience you had, and were getting ready to make significant decisions based on that wrong assumption. Correcting them was absolutely the right thing to do. If the rest of your family can't handle that, it's on them.", "NTA and anyone that doesn't think birth is traumatic is bonkers.  It involves lots of pain, lots of blood, and in many cases a lot of medical intervention to deal with or prevent major complications.  Woman produces hormones that help them deal with the trauma of producing a whole human.  Everyone else present has to just deal with it and adults can make that informed consent but a kid really doesn't get to and it sounds like the adults need that reality check.", "NTA your family has clearly been lying about how that experience was for you, frankly mad that they've been sharing it at all. You've not ruined anything for this couple, you've given the truth about your experience, what you may have ruined is their faith in anything your family tells them. I wonder how annoyed your family would be about your honesty if you hadn't showed them up.\n\nIt would have been better if you had gone \"actually my experience was this...\" because your phrasing was a bit harsh towards the couple, but it's really easy to pick apart someone's wording in hindsight, it's much harder to get it right in an emotional moment.", "NTA. They wanted their first child to have an expirence like yours. Clearly they were under an impression that you had a good expirence. You shined some truth on your expirence. Nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nVery mature of you that you were able to move on with your parents and hold no resentment for that mistake!!", "NTA, but your family continues to be the thoughtless AHs that you always knew they were.  The number of times it's been a good idea to have little children in the delivery room can probably be counted on the fingers of one finger.\n\n You saved a child from trauma, and you saved some parents for making a mistake that they could well regret for the rest of their lives. Why would they feel like bad parents? Because they had a bad idea? It's not like they had a chance to carry it out and then you informed them of the trauma they'd likely inflicted.  Your information was timely, on point, and badly needed. \n\n It's important that existing children feel involved in the general expectation of a new family member,  but that does not mean they should be required to be there for the birth.   You spoke your truth and hopefully it was heard.", "NTA. Maybe you could have framed your response a bit more kindly and explained your past experience, but at the end of the day you were making your feelings known about a terrible idea on the parents\u2019 part!

You know more than they do how it can affect a kid. If they didn\u2019t want your honest opinion, they should not have brought it up.", "NTA.  I recall when a friend was telling us about giving birth. The doctors wheeled in a mirror. She said, \"What the hell is that for?\" They told her it was so she could see her baby being born. She said \"Get that out of here! Why would I want to see that!\"  Now, if a woman doesn't want to see that, I don't see why kids would. Men have fainted watching their wives give birth! Things have gone wrong My SIL had an emergency C-section. If they hadn't put up a curtain, I know my brother would have fainted. My dad said if he had been in the room (it was the 50's), there would not have had a second kid.\n\nNow, if these people want to record it (which is weird IMHO) and show it to their kid later, they can traumatize him at their leisure.", "NAH.

It was obviously very traumatizing for you, and your aunt was presenting it as if it had been some wonderful moment. You were merely pointing out that she was mistaken in her perception.

That\u2019s what led to them to making that comment about your experience, and you corrected them.\n\nCould you have been more tactful? Sure. You already had been by not saying anything before they referenced you directly. At that point you couldn\u2019t hold back.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin the birth. It hasn\u2019t happened yet.

My mom and dad had him do SO MUCH research before even agreeing to it because they didn\u2019t want him traumatized!

For any soon-to-be first time fathers out there; yes, your wife/girlfriend/baby mama will indeed absolutely hate you with all of her being for a brief moment in time. But fear not, as long as you were treating her right beforehand she\u2019ll get over it fairly quickly. (The nurse discreetly asked if I needed someone to look at my hand afterward. Thankfully, I did not.)\n\nI wanted to see the \u201cbusiness end\u201d of the experience. This would be our last child and I wouldn\u2019t have another chance, I thought.

Abso-fucking-lutely. And somehow reminiscent of Alien.\n\nI still feel it was something I needed to do. I don\u2019t exactly regret it, but I would never do that to a small child.

Still grosses me out, and I'm in my 30s. It's not a beautiful and magical moment to a child. The view is something from a horror movie. There is no need to expose a kid to that", "NTA.

You spoke the truth.", "NTA that couple was probably embarrassed they hadn\u2019t considered the potential outcome", "NTA. I gave birth twice. No way would I subject a 6 year old to that. Your response was just a reaction based on what they said and what you experienced. It wasn't some thought out plan to ruin their moment,  which isn't ruined.

Learn how to talk tactfully to people. \n\nThat was a jerky thing to blurt out.

You could have told them about your experience without expressing it in such a negative way. Your experience is just one person's experience, and extrapolating that to everyone else is an AH move. Your point of view could have been a valuable contribution to their decision-making in a balanced way, but it wasn't at all. \n\nAs a caregiver, I've been to many births where children were present, and the vast majority were totally fine. My own daughter, 4 yo at the time, was at her sisters birth, and she loved being a part of it and still talks about it years later. It  depends on the age of the child, if too young, they are too scared and confused about what's happening, and if too old they might find it gross and they might not to want to see that. They need prep, info about what they might see and what might happen, and they need to have someone who is dedicated to helping them out, so if they want to leave, get tired or bored, they have someone to help them. I have them do little jobs, like keep a towel warm under their shirt to use to wipe off the baby. It's unfortunate that so many people on here have such a bad/limited view of childbirth. I'm not naive at all to complications that can happen, but it works just fine most of the time.", "Sorry, but I laughed out loud at this.  And before I dive in:  ESH.\n\nI \u201ccaught\u201d my younger sister.  I shit you not; I was\u2026 a month shy of 3 years old.   My older sister (5 years old), cut her umbilical cord.   \n\nThe particular OBGYN, who delivered 2 out of 3 of us, is an absolute legend.

You guessed it, they were willing.   And there\u2019s a funny story about me sitting just off the side of his knee as he was \u201cdelivering,\u201d and seeing a tiny head appear\u2026 and vocalizing \u201cdo we put the pieces together!?!?!?\u201d  \n\n(I\u2019m giggling, sorry).\n\nBut anyway, I never NOT knew what sex was, or how babies were made.

Now, I wasn\u2019t 6 years old at the time and while I do remember snippets of my sister\u2019s entry into this world, I only have one or two brief flashes of \u201cthat,\u201d AT BEST.  Or maybe it\u2019s because there were photos\u2026.. there were photos at some point.   \n\nAnyway- I say \u201cESH\u201d because it sounds like your parents wanted you to share the experience but didn\u2019t understand the gravity of being a 6 year old who was likely, ENTIRELY UNAWARE OF\u2026 ALL OF THAT.  \n\nAnd for you as well\u2026 but only the TINIEST BIT because despite the horrific trauma of THAT (which you need make no excuse for, WTF, darling, I\u2019m sorry!), you are traumatized to the point that you only associate childbirth with awful \u201call the things.\u201d  \n\nAs an adult?  You could not PAY ME to be in a delivery room.  FUCK THAT, I can\u2019t even watch Kill Bill without covering my eyes for half of it.  NOOOOOPE.  \n\nGodspeed, dear.

They\u2019re excited about it and you just casually dismissed. \nThere are tons of way to tell your story, offer advice,vvv\u2026vv and you\u2019re passive aggressive with someone you don\u2019t even know. \n\nYour family are a h because they make a big deal of out a childish moment by blowing up your phone.", "I'm guessing there's not many people here who grew up on a farm.", "ESH You could have been better with how you presented your lived experience. No need for passive aggression. There are 100 ways to make the point without being so rude.\n\nThey suck for making a big deal of it. Unless they think you're in charge of their birth plan...

It\u2019s not like you ran into the delivery room in the middle of the delivery screaming that their child should cover their eyes from the hellscape of childbirth or go insane. \n\nWitnessing childbirth at a young age can definitely be traumatic: At age 9, friend of mine had to help deliver her baby sister when her mom, who had birthed eight previous children, went into labor so rapidly that there was no time to call an ambulance or even a nearby doctor before the baby arrived. My friend found the whole experience so gory and traumatic that she decided to never have kids herself.\n\nETA: added a sentence for clarity", "NTA \nbut I want to  add that I witnessed the birth of my younger brother when I was five, and was not at all traumatized by the experience.

And it definitely can be scary for a little kid to see, especially if they don't understand a lot and don't have the luxury of stellar sex Ed, knowledge of body parts, and a big, big explanation of what will happen, and have that convo multiple times. I will do a counter point, though (and it still doesn't make you an AH at all!): my brother was there for my birth when he was 6. Thought it was great, still thinks it great. Said it was a little yuck but also interesting and made him so excited and happy. But, my dad was very much a \"explain everything, use  REAL body terms, don't shield them from the other genders body terminology, let's actually talk about birth and no it wasn't a fucking stork.\". I think a number of factors could change your experience, oerson to person. Too many to list here. But a few are: is the mother in agony, or did she opt to use a form of pain management. How much biological info do you know about women. How many times did your parents talk about what will happen. What did they say specifically (ie: the baby lives in a little water balloon filled with water and even blood, so he can fill up with those important things!!! -yes I know not 100% accurate buuuut a great way to explain the blood and liquid so it is less scary, which is how it was explained to my brother.). .....Actually, I do remember one thing he WAS freaked out of though.. they forgot to explain the umbilical cord and he was briefly convinced they were about to cut off my penis (I am a female, and he thought they made a mistake and was really his little brother, not sister.

I cannot imagine gleefully _planning_ to put your kid in a position of seeing you in a position where you will be in pain, with lots of blood and everything else, where things can go poorly and turn into a dire situation in an instant. \n\nThat's so supremely messed up. Sorry for what you had to go through, and I'm sorry your family has been holding up a terrible moment for you as something that other people should be excited to try. \n\nI think it was good of you to speak up and say \"hey, as the kid who did this, it wasn't great or fun for me\"", "If that simple remark \u201cruined the birth of their kid\u201d then they absolutely 1000% are already shitty parents. \n\nNTA", "Let them think that.

I cannot imagine having a child half that age go thru something even more painful and messy and not be traumatized. \n\n\nOP, you are NTA and the couple literally said they want their child to have an experience like yours. You were just honest about your experience. What if something goes wrong? Cord around the neck, hemorrhaging, etc. would it still be an ok experience? Keep kids out of delivery rooms.", "Not the same, but I once had a cat give birth on top of me while I was sleeping.\nWaking up to that was traumatizing\n\nLet alone seeing your parent doing that?\n\nNta, op.", "NTA. I\u2019m happy my parents let me believe until puberty a stork brought my brothers home. LOL that is traumatizing and I probably wouldn\u2019t have children if I witnessed my mom give birth.", "NTA, it's really stupid for parents to do that. What if something goes wrong. I've had 2 kids. I love to pieces, but man, those births traumatized me, and they weren't as bad as some people have it. When I look back to me, I wouldn't describe it as magical and I'm 33. How on earth would a young child think its magical", "NTA. I didn\u2019t even want to see the details when I gave birth. Would I like a mirror HELL NO.", "I saw a video of me giving birth and every-time I think about it I cross my legs TIGHT cause OMG why would they film that why did I say okay to let them film that", "NTA. I think witnessing a birth would be traumatic for a kid seeing the mother in pain and all. I wonder if the hospital would even allow that nowadays.", "NTA\n\nThat couple probably didn't even think to ask how other people in that situation felt about it; you handed out a hard truth about it that they're going to have to think about now. Especially because it seems your family has been selling your experience as a magical moment when it was not.\n\nMy mom's a retired L&D nurse. She has seen plenty of disgusting and traumatizing things as an adult...children should not be there, just in case something goes horribly wrong. Not even just to prevent trauma--so they're not in the way and in need of additional care while mom and/or baby needs help.", "NTA. I didn't watch my own being born and I was the one giving birth. There was a mirror, and the nurse kept trying to get me to look, and I finally told her no, I could feel it and that was enough.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s silly how they can say their opinion and you can\u2019t. It\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows.", "NTA. If parents are going to dominate the conversation as if everyone wants to hear every detail of their birth plan, they can deal with opinions expressed to them. Hearing what their dumb idea did to an actual child is info they need to process.", "How did you ruin it when it hasn't happened yet? Good for you for being honest in that situation. NTA. Hopefully you saved another kid from that trauma.", "This is so fucked up, there\u2019s no way the hospital allow that right?? At least now, its been 18 years since then surely they ban kids since then right? RIGHT?", "NTA. Just when I think humans can't get any more bizarre I hear something new. You were absolutely correct to tell them reality of it. I think it's awful to do that to your child who probably can't even say no cuz they don't understand and also don't wanna refuse their parents.", "NTA. Birth is traumatic. Imagine if there are complications and their child is watching? Fucking lunatics", "**NTA**\n\nThey basically, in a very round about way, asked your opinion and you told them. It traumatised you. If they want to do that to their kid, go for it. In otherwords: Don't. You saved their kid and they should be grateful.", "NTA, omg. What if something happened? What if that child had to watch their mother or newborn sibling die right in front of them? Even if not, how traumatizing to have to watch your mom scream in agony, bleeding and crapping herself. That\u2019s so bonkers. Good on you for looking out for the kid.", "NTA. Also, if one comment could \u201cruin the birth of their child,\u201d they have no clue what they are in for as parents.", "NTA, you may well have not only spared that child from a traumatising experience but maybe saved that couple on future therapy bills. Honestly I\u2019m at a loss to even fathom why parents would want their child to witness something like that!", "Yeah YATA. Not because you said it, but because of the WAY you said it. You could have said something like... \"just to offer a counter-opinion from my own experience, when I was 6 I saw the birth of my brother and it was traumatic for me.\" At that point you've opened their eyes to the potential issue without offending them.", "NTA. I was offered a mirror so I could see my son's head when I was giving birth, and I gave them a hard NOPE. I don't know how my husband watched the whole thing, up to the afterbirth. He never said anything about it being traumatizing, but I couldn't imagine a child going through that.\n\nI couldn't imagine making my son witness his younger sibling being born. Even if he asked, I'd still probably be wary and lean more towards a no. Watching his mom's hoo-ha push a baby out is an image I'd rather he not have seared into his retinas.", "NTA - You did right by that kid!", "NTA I hope you got through to them.", "Big reason why I still haven\u2019t had kids in my 30\u2019s is thanks to hearing all the traumatic birth stories clients told as a teenager working in a hair salon with a pregnant boss. I couldn\u2019t imagine seeing it happen in real life as a child. Good on you for being honest, childbirth can be horrific and not something a kid should see their mum going through. NTA.", "(Insert Jackie Chan WTF/Mind Blown Meme)\n\nThere are people that want there child to be in the delivery room?!\nNTA!", "NTA! I have a 2 year old and if I were too have another he would be 5 I would never let him anywhere near the birthing experience.", "Well my first thought is who the heck thinks a little kid wants to see his mother's \"who-ha\" under any circumstances, let alone see it while she's pushing a cantaloupe through it?? Gee whiz, what is wrong with this couples' head? You are NTA. Glad you spoke up.....some of the grownups should have had more common sense (and guts) and spoke up!", "NTA. They\u2019re grown adults, they can get over feeling like idiots. At least that kid won\u2019t be traumatized.", "I was traumatized at my Sister\u2019s bed side while she gave birth.\nIt all went bad and she need oxygen and a c section. \nDoctors and nurses swarmed her bedside.\nI knew I didn\u2019t want to watch the c section when asked by a staff.\nHer husband went, and I nearly fainted.\nShe had my Nephew and they both stayed in the hospital for a month , her with an infection and he has lifelong disabilities.\nI was about 22 years old and still lacked the knowledge and maturity for what was happening.\nI\u2019m conflicted but feel it\u2019s an individual families choice,\nDepends on the maturity of the kid and if they are ready to see mom completely nude and with all the things that accompany a birth.\nI would think anyone below a teenager would have a hard time processing it.", "I was there for my mom's last 3 births. I was 17 for the first. I was supposed to drive her to the hospital, but she was too big to fit in the truck and my stepdad had the other vehicle. I sat beside her. Once my brother was born I walked over and held his cleaned hand. \nThe next pregnancy was twins she was 42, and I was 19. They put her in the biggest room and had many nurses in training there as well as it is a requirement for their schooling. They put me front and center with the nurses to watch the babies come out. \nI much preferred to sit beside her", "NTA. Aside from the whole no child should watch their mom yell and scream in pain I\u2019d add no child wants to see their mom\u2019s lady bits covered in blood and quite possibly other stuff.  How is that not traumatic?  How do they not see it just like we all viewed the alien bursting out of the chest in the movie?  \n\nKids don\u2019t need to see the ugly side of birth and what if something goes wrong?\n\nI\u2019m thinking it would make any girl think no way no how am I ever having baby and any boy will think no way no how am I letting anyone I love go through that!", "Nta. I don't understand the reasoning. Even I was traumatized by my labor and births. I can't imagine having my child witness it!", "NTA", " NTA I was a whole adult when I witnessed my sister give birth, it was absolutely traumatizing, to me. An adult woman of 30 years old. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Yes it\u2019s natural and all that stuff, but beautiful, magical and all the other dreamy words people use to describe it are not it.  \n\nI would contact the couple personally and explain, that while your intention wasn\u2019t to hurt them, they should know that witnessing birth is not a magical event as a child. Let them hear your experience. In the end they\u2019re going to make their own decisions about it, but they should get all different perspectives on it beforehand.", "NTA. You did not know the couple personally, yet they knew of you. Probably through your aunt as evidenced by her reaction even before you spoke. Couple did not come up with the idea, \u201c to have an experience like I have\u201d,aunt lied and told them how magical it was for you, you corrected that. You did not say anything graphic, you stated a simple fact related to yourself. Aunt and family are blowing your phone because they were caught in their lie. You did not ruin a birth that has not happened yet but you probably ruined the couple\u2019s relationship with your extended family and that might not be a bad thing.", "NTA. Hospital births are not an ideal time for a small child to hang out. There is a LOT of blood and discomfort involved. It would also be boring for the kiddo until things got going. In fact, many hospitals do not allow underaged people to visit during a birthing. I don\u2019t think you ruined anything. I think they had a very clear vision for what they wanted to go down, and you gave them a perspective that they didn\u2019t consider or want to face.\n\nSuch is life. This is something that should have occurred to them as adults and caretakers of a child. They needed to be thinking about the older sibling and their needs, as well as their own vision or wants.", "Not at all kiddo. You were standing up for that little one. They are pissed because you made them realize it was a bad idea and they had to put their disappointment on someone else. You were that someone. Sometimes, you gotta stand up for what is right, no matter who is going to get upset. You saved that little one a life ti e of issues. Hell, i was a grown man when i watched both my daughters come into the world, and it was tramatizeing for me", "I the mother of my child didn't want to witness my own labor because of how traumatizing it is. I stared at the ceiling all 7 hours and couldn't even look at my own baby until she had been cleaned up and I'd showered. Child birth is disgusting and traumatic. Yes you get this little miracle out of it but no child should watch the process", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like someone in your family told the expectant mother your story which wasn't right at all.  However, you could have used way more decorum with how you replied, too, though hopefully you gave them food for thought, regardless.  The expectant mother is wrong for saying that you \"ruined\" the birth of their child because it would still be an incredible moment.  The only people who can decide whether or not the birth of their child is \"ruined\" are the expectant parents.  You aren't responsible for how someone is going to react to what you say, but you are responsible for how something's said.  \nYour family blowing your phone up and yelling at you for what you said is ridiculous and wrong because they're still accosting you for how uncomfortable you felt so long ago and making you feel, what seems like anger and resentment that they're still trying to make you change how you felt regarding your sibling's birth and continually making you out to be the \"bad guy\" for not appreciating the experience.  Honestly, I'd probably be traumatised, too.\n\nSo, yeah, no one's off the hook this time.", "NTA. I\u2019m a grown woman who has given birth and even I don\u2019t want to see it happen from that POV. I think if I had a hand mirror, I would have passed out. No thank you. It\u2019s way too traumatizing for a child.", "NTA as a fellow witness to the miracles- it wasn\u2019t.  Watching your mom shit in the bed and scream while her lower half is exposed is traumatizing!\n\nThey can film it and show it off. See if anyone goes \u201coh the miracle!\u201d", "Nta. My kid begged me to see the birth of their sibling. We said no. They are under 10, it's a private and terrifying time, and while I do think birth is beautiful it's not a sharing time. I made something beautiful but getting it out was scary and gross. I showed them a few videos and had the sound low, let them pause, ask question etc. You absolutely did the right thing sharing your first hand experience.", "I'm wondering how old their first child is? \n\nBut no, you are NTA", "Well since they drew you into it by saying they wanted their tyke to have \"an experience like you had\" I think you were well within your rights to let them know about the \"experience you had.\"", "NTA if anything a savior , but I get why they thought they are horrible parents , they're not either just probably heard from your family how \"wonderful\" experience it was (gaslighting) and got caught up in family dynamics from your family that they weren't supposed to get in to , trust me it probably was for the best they heard about your experience from you not from your family who delusionally think it was wonderful, but I would have said it in better tone they probably saw the pure horror in your face and voice and thought ooh my god we almost did that to our kid we are horrible parents which I repeat they are not , they only had misinformation and the wrong versi\u00f3n of events", "Everyone responds differently to birth, some with awe, some with yikes. I do know it is not a spectator sport so chose  judiciously.", "NTA. I could never imagine having my son in the room while I\u2019m giving birth to his sibling. That\u2019s fucking insane.", "NTA for talking about your experience, although I do think you should have spoken more gently.  Adults need to remember kids aren\u2019t mini adults, they react very differently to challenging experiences.  Seeing mommy in pain and all that blood and stuff, why would adults think a little kid can handle that?", "NTA\nThey know how you feel about it. Clearly the expect you to shut up and be quiet.", "NTA. I hope you have saved this kid from the traumatic experience.", "NTA- kids don't usually react well to seeing lots of blood. That alone would make me reluctant to have them watch a birth. You spoke about your experience. The expectant parents are assholes if they don't consider they might traumatize their kid.", "NTA. At all. You spoke about your experience which is factual .", "NTA!!! You quite literally saved that family a trauma. My husband was present at his sisters\u2019 birth when he was a little kid too; watching his mom scream and labor, the whole messy ordeal of birth absolutely traumatized him, his parents have also apologized and everyone has moved on but they would absolutely speak up to spare another family that experience. It all seems nice in theory, but the reality of birth is not pretty, especially for a child.", "NTA I hope she saved another child from the same trauma. It's a scary thing. Then you realize that was you before and that feels gross. Seeing your mom in pain and that part of her.. . Just no. Don't do it.", "NTA they needed to think about the reality of what they are doing \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think you \u201cruined the birth\u201d. It wasn\u2019t in progress or anything it was just a discussion of what they were going to do.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a ton of deliveries and they\u2019re always sort of mind boggling to watch, even as someone who knows what\u2019s going on. Plus what if shit goes sideways and mom and/or baby are not ok? I\u2019m all for educating children but they can get the kid a birth book or something. Timmy doesn\u2019t need to see his mom bleeding and pooping all over.", "NTA. \n\nDon\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to.\n\nMy 1st was not in the room. \n\nBirth is not magic. It\u2019s gross and violent.", "It was  bad enough for me as a 30 year old adult to witness that.\n\nI cannot imagine forcing a child to.  That's %@%@ abusive.\n\nWhat assholes.\n\nNTA OP, and good for you for speaking up.", "NTA! I can\u2019t imagine my kids being anywhere near that madness. I\u2019m due in 2 weeks with my third and my daughters will stay at my mom\u2019s until the deed is all the way done. It makes me anxious thinking of them trying to process what\u2019s happening while witnessing me in such a state. Definitely not a place for young children. \n\nAlso, just for reference, when I was 18 and giving birth to my first daughter, my husband (18) (boyfriend then), mom (41) and aunt (34) were all there. Both my mom and aunt had 3 kids of their own but while my mother was present for the birth of my aunt\u2019s children, my aunt had never witnessed it before. By the end of it my aunt was hiding in the corner crying because she just wasn\u2019t prepared to see her niece in pain like that. She apologized afterward because she felt she wasn\u2019t a helpful or calming presence and it stressed her out more than she imagined it would. (Honestly I barely noticed her during the whole thing \ud83d\ude02) The point being that even some adults struggle watching their loved ones go through something so traumatic and I wouldn\u2019t even consider doing that to a kid.", "NTA but also not a universal reaction. I did the same as you at 7 years old. It is a very positive memory for me. But my mom absolutely prepared me for what to expect and I understood what would be happening completely. Without enough talks with a kid, it can easily be traumatic.", "NTA You experience that and it was traumatizing and you didn't want any other child to experience the trauma that you had on that day and all you were trying to do was protect the kid from the trauma", "When I gave birth both times I refused to look in the mirror to see the process. Nope. That's insane that someone would want a child to. Nta", "NTA, you gave your opinion about something you have personal experience with that they dont.  IMO, you did them a favor.", "NTA. What your aunt said was proper, I would never do that, if these ppl want their oldest to be there when the child is born, they can be outside the room! Not inside the room when you see your mom yeet a baby out of her vagina!!", "nta that is traumatic there are videos of first time dads passing out and /or vomiting and they  expect a child to handle this better?", "I grew up on a farm in the 70s. I wasn't there for the actual births, but I've been around a few of my mom's friends during their home births. It wasn't scary because I'd seen animals have babies. I expected moaning and yelling.\n\nI knew giving birth hurt and was pretty gory. I was glad that my mom chose to have her kids in a hospital and I didn't have to see any of it.", "NTA. I thought my SIL was off her rocker for letting her 6 year old daughter witness her home birth. My daughter is the same age and I wouldn't subject her to that. I remember being traumatized watching a birthing video in sex ed and I was much older. Now way I'd let a child half that age be up close and personal to it when they hardly have an understanding of the world around them as it is.", "NTA - although perhaps your delivery could have been better.  Lol!  I have had 3 kids.  I can\u2019t for the life of me, understand why anyone would:\n\n1. want a child (specially a toddler or small child) in the room while labouring and giving birth.  That sounds like so much added stress, I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that.  \n\n2. Force their child to watch you go through agonizing pain for hours.  \n\n3. Want their child to see the disgusting stuff that comes out with the baby.  Blood, slime, sometimes poop, then the placenta.  \n\nSure, birth is a wonderful part of life, but I can absolutely see why it would be traumatizing to a child with a front row view.", "NTA, not by a long shot!\n\nI'm glad I worked my way up to it. Grew up on a ranch, saw all kinds of births. Dogs, cats, cows, goats NBD, right? Enter EMT school, everybody gets to sit through that video, some got a little green around the gills. When my wife went to her first appointment with her OB, I even asked if I could catch. And I would have, if his head wasn't so damn big! A hour and a plunger later, I've got a son!\n\nMy lord, what a mess. I've worked multi-car MVAs, with a half a dozen patients and not had that much of a mess.

She\u2019s a nurse and just didn\u2019t want me getting wrong information, since the kids at school were already spreading nonsense in kindergarten. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m a really squeamish person when it comes to mucus and slime, etc. I have seen some birth videos and my face while watching is probably comical. Too much liquid and mucus and gore \ud83e\udd22 and that\u2019s after having a kid of my own (I didn\u2019t want the mirror to watch) and another due in a couple of months. I think some people have the stomach for it and some just don\u2019t .", "Yeah, if mom starts to die in the Walmart kiddy pool, that's so relaxing. Maybe the kid can even be the one to call the ambulance!", "I did. I've seen all kinds of animal births. But I would have no desire to have been handed a mirror while I was giving birth.  And I wouldn't want to watch someone else give birth at least not from the business end of things.", "It's a hospital. My family just happens to manage all the maternity ward and they bring the option to all the families there and just use me as an example lol. Not a cult, just a simple hospital ward", "I have no clue if it's banned or not. My family manages the whole ward though, so maybe that's why it's posible but we are also not in the US", "My mom gave birth to 7 children.  In her forties she took a health class and there was a movie showing a woman give birth.  Mom said she was so glad she didn't see that view/angle while giving birth.", "My ex husband said it traumatized him lol", "Im going to h3ll for laughing at this as much as I did \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I remember this one. Dad came back into the room and said daughter was bawling because she had heard mom screaming and was terrified something horrible had happened to her. The parents were laughing, but dad said mom had better to go daughter and tell her she is okay since she didn't believe dad.", "Yeah, that was cute to me because like, obviously an accident, and they were sincerely comforting her and more making fun of themselves lol", "And I can\u2019t imagine how a child that small would interpret their new baby sibling coming out covered in blood while screaming", "Dude, I've given birth and I think the process is repulsive. The new life is beautiful,  the birth isn't. Ob was my least favorite clinical rotation.", "And shitting on the table. Don\u2019t forget that part.", "Yeah, my father had a panic attack when my mom was in labor with me. He was also driving her crazy trying to \"help\", so she yelled at him to get out.", "Not every woman screams. Labor and delivery are easier than dysmenorrhea every three weeks.", "Maternal mortality is on the upswing in the US, so who knows, we might be able to hit those pre-handwashing numbers.", "As an adult who watched his wife give birth, it was not magical. I wouldn't wish that on anybody, let alone a child. The magic is after that. Way after that. When you get the all-clear that everyone is ok and cleaned up and whatever else needs to get done post-childbirth. That's the time to introduce family members to the new baby.", "As a woman who has given birth, it is absolutely not magical. The process is tedious, painful, and gross. It also smells like someone skinned a deer .", "They played a childbirth video in high school. Maybe sex Ed ?\nIt was like filmed in the 70\u2019s, it was wild and showed her urinating, and full views of every angle.\nIt was a lot to take in, while sitting in class with your friends", "This is the funniest reddit post I\u2019ve read in a while\u2014 I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve lived it.\n\nUm\u2026 it\u2019s completely bonkers (unconscionable, really) that they work in that field and encourage / facilitate people bringing kids in for births.\n\nWatching an uncomplicated birth would be traumatizing as a kid. But there\u2019s risk of them seeing something much *more* traumatizing! For what, to have seen something that 99.9999999% of siblings haven\u2019t seen?\n\nEven aside from that, you were the only person at that party qualified to speak on the effect being in the room has on the kid. Kudos for speaking up.", "Ok to an extent sure. I\u2019m a nurse. My dads a surgeon, mom and aunt were nurses, uncles an MD. The thought of a young kid seeing their mom give birth is horrible to me. No WAY I\u2019d want to see my mom popping one out. What if the birth goes wrong? What if the baby and/or mommy aren\u2019t ok?", "I gave you the 222th upvote! Don't they call that an angel number or something? Maybe you can spin that into, like, IDK, the internet has granted me this sacred mission...\n\nNTA!\n\nAlso, videos of births exist, could you convince those parents to watch that and determine if they'd let their kid watch it? And then scale up the horror to something happening in front of them, with their mom involved?", "Yeah. I mean, I was all rose-tinted glasses the moment I held my son, but I still remember the horrible pain, the fear when my son and a big decel, all the blood that came out of me afterward while they were pushing on my stomach. It\u2019s gory stuff, and that\u2019s with a very smooth delivery! I can\u2019t imagine having a traumatic delivery and emergency interventions, medical malpractice, etc. which many women have.", "I don't think protect is the right word. Maybe the hormones help the women forget/misremember the trauma >6 months down the line.\n\nAfter all most people who have children have 2 or more, and it's not like the second one is adopted or preferential C-section.\n\nEvery woman I know has told me horror stories of their first birth. Low an behold 2-3 years later they're back in the game again.", "Yeah, my school's educational birthing video cured me of wanting to birth a baby. Later karma did the rest and now I am child free with the inability to reproduce. Worst part is the weird ass baby fever I sometimes get because my body didn't want kids when I could get pregnant. Almost as soon as my uterus was thrown out, my body was like \"WE WANT BABY NOW\" which sorta sucks tbh lmao", "Exactly this!", "I saw \"a baby story\" once. It was completely uncensored. Scarred me for life. Never wanted kids after that and will never have them.", "I'm not having kids and weirdly one of the things that super turned me off childbirth was the idea of them putting the baby on your chest while it was still all gooey. Like slime and all just. On your skin. I can barely handle when the ketchup bottle is almost empty and squirts on my hand.", "Everytime I touch my newborns head I like flash back to feeling him crown and it gives me chills", "Statistics shows that Mom is more likely to die crossing the street in front of her kid. Or probably more likely to die in a mass shooting at the mall.", "Thank goodness! Sorry I was scrolling and for some reason that freaked me out for a second. Thank you for clarifying.\nEdit2:  NTA. Though this whole situation might be out of my cultural understanding.", "The nurse asked if I wanted a mirror so I could watch my daughter's birth. Hell no!", "Which hospital lets children into the delivery room? I don't think they would allow that would they?", "I managed my whole life without ever watching any kind of birth until I was forced to in the birthing class when I was pregnant.  I still don't really think I needed to see that.  Thankfully they didn't make us watch the video of the c-section (which I did end up having eventually and am still grateful I had no idea what was going on down there). Sometimes it is best not to know.  You can't see anything from the angle you have so why do you have to know?", "It's not just about being useless.\n\nChildbirth is not a pretty, peaceful, clean event to witness.  I'm a grown ass woman and I want no part in ever witnessing childbirth ever again.\n\nWe watched \"The Miracle of Life\" video in my 7th grade health class.  Yeah. . .miracle my ass. Should have titled it \"Scared Straight\" because that video is 90% of the reason why I am childfree to this day.\n\nAs an adult who studied molecular biology I can attest that conception and fetal development is cool AF. But pregnancy is also freaky, and childbirth is dangerous and messy and gross.\n\nNatural, sure. But so is vomiting, defecating, and a slew of other bodily functions I don't want to witness either.\n\nChildbirth I not really something most children would want to witness nor probably should witness.\n\nParents are often disconnected from reality with their birth plan ideas.  What happens if something goes wrong and there's a medical emergency? You really want your child front and center for that in case their mom dies or she delivers a stillborn infant?", "Idk, I watched my sister be born and had a great experience. However, I was 13, not 6, and very interested in the birth/pregnancy process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible thing to do, but being able to support someone in labor and also witness an incredible thing was pretty cool for me. This seems like one of those case-by-case decisions that could easily be solved by the couple having a conversation with their child about if this is something their child is comfortable with and wants to do.", "One of the actual nurses told my husband she was going to be hearing my chants/groans/screams in her dreams for weeks cos my son\u2019s birth was that bad- can\u2019t imagine subjecting an innocent child to that!", "I\u2019m joining you lol", "Here\u2019s the video: https://www.tiktok.com/@jayciunderwood/video/7205005122206879022?pid=video_embed&referer_video_id=7205005122206879022&type=video&referer_url=www.outkick.com/daughter-sobs-after-hearing-parents-have-sex-order-pizza/&refer=embed&embed_source=121352282,121331973,120811592,120810756;null;embed_share", "That reminds me of a story where a family had their church's priest over for dinner and they had their 4 year old daughter say grace.

I could never work in medicine. My husband on the other hand is fascinated by it. During my first child's birth, a resident delivered baby with a med student shadowing. Once the placenta was out the med student was preparing it on a table to examine. My husband (bio PhD student at the time) wandered over to look at it then the two of them proceeded to nerd out over my placenta.

And if they choose it and speak to me about it, I'll be honest with them.  They've seen me handle a crisis when my sister had a seizure in our kitchen with no prior history, but even in that moment of handling that crisis, I also made sure my kids got out of the room.  I don't get it on my end when people don't think about how desensitized they are when thinking about others in that situation, especially kids. But that's just me. I get that everyone is different.\n\nOP, def NTA.", "I also keep returning to that point: what if something goes catastrophically wrong? Does the kid need to see their sibling or their mom die?", "But did you choose to give birth to a second child after all of that?", "That sounds like a positive! \n\nI had \u201cabstinence-only\u201d education in school so we definitely didn\u2019t study any actual information and reproduction or childbirth, but I believe strongly that actual information and teaching about what happens during pregnancy, childbirth, and early childhood would both be more useful and far more effective in getting kids to wait to have sex till they\u2019re truly ready.", "i had to watch a CAT give birth on video in school \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Of course she can render an opinion, and it has legitimacy since it is based on actual experience. But it's definitely not guaranteed to be applicable to ***every kid***, *that* is my point. What OP said: \n\n>I said \"If what you want is traumatize that kid for life, be my guest.\"\n\n***is*** indeed speaking for every kid, and it should be blatantly obvious she's wrong to assume they all would react the way she did. \n\nIf she just said something like \"it traumatized me, so perhaps you should rethink your decision\" to the parents, she would actually be correct on the whole and probably far more helpful.", "Yeah, that's a valid comment. I was annoyed because they very much know how I feel about birth and talking about it, they know I don't have a good reaction and yet they brought this couple up to talk with me about their birth so I was annoyed. I was snapping more at my family than the couple, they just happen to take the blunt of it I guess", "Go chew on an amber necklace.", "It\u2019s also possible for a kid to be in a delivery room and see or hear their mother have medical complications.

Maybe they used to?", "Apparently a branch of OP's extended family manages a wing of the hospital and takes liberties.", "We had to watch a birth video in health class and, uh, even if it's an absolute perfect birth with no issues, it still is pretty dang gross. And if something goes wrong, why have the kid there to worry if their mom is gonna die or something?", "Me too. They should shoe this to every 7th grade kid in the US.", "I gotcha, I've just seen people being shitty about that video, like seriously saying they shouldn't have sex in the same house as their kid and stuff.", "Nah, it's gross. Get the fuck out of here with asking me if I want a mirror to see the baby emerging from my body. . .I can feel it! I don't need to see it! And asking if I want to examine the placenta.  .  . No, thanks, I've been present for autopsies/surgeries; I've seen organs. And why do people video/take crotch shots of a birth? Who are they showing these to?", "As a person who willingly gave birth four times\u2026FACTS", "Lol, I've attended autopsies that were supper gross and interesting!

Had a great healthy pregnancy otherwise. What they are going through is unfathomable. But imagine being a child and witnessing that. That's a whole separate bucket of fucked up.", "Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean much. Plenty of women have terrible trauma that isn\u2019t helped or fixed by hormones.

Idek", "I fully admit I was bummed that nobody showed me the placenta. I thought getting to see my own house-made organ would have been so cool. \n\nDamn if I was going to see the moment of birth though. Yuck. Just give me the baby please.", "I mean if someone is traumatized and still signs up  to do it again (and let's face it in most circumstances giving birth is totally voluntary) then obviously it wasn't that traumatizing or the trauma's been forgotten.\n\nI give people who watched a birth a pass because watching isn't the same as doing. But I think for birthing women, the hormones must make them forget the trauma because most people who have a child go on to have more.", "You can\u2019t guarantee where they will be depending on the birth. If it\u2019s like the layout of the hospital I delivered at, they couldn\u2019t be up by the mothers head, that\u2019s where the machines are and nurses also were. They couldn\u2019t be really far off to the side. And as far as avoiding the fluids, again depends on the birth but likely no. Once the waters are broken it\u2019s not usually one gush and done, so you have that fluid randomly spilling out. I had a hemorrhage so my blood was quiet literally all over the room and even getting into the hallway. There is no \u201csafe space\u201d in a delivery room.

I'm actually pregnant with my 4th right now. . .", "But many people who experience truly traumatic births don\u2019t have more kids. Not all births are traumatic, mine wasn\u2019t (as I said in my original comment). So asking me if I had another kid is kind of a moot point.", "It\u2019s also really scary to see your mom in pain, regardless of the situation. I was 4 when my mom slipped while we were ice skating and broke her arm so bad she threw up, couldn\u2019t stand and needed surgery. I had a fear of ice skating since then and rarely go. My skills are limited now because of my lack of practice which makes me more anxious of falling.", "I\u2019ve never gotten to see my own organs and I think they\u2019re cool. I had epidurals with both babies so I didn\u2019t feel that part, but it makes sense that it would hurt.
