I honestly can't fathom wanting your child to witness their parent in pain just for them to see the \"miracle of birth\". That's extremely traumatizing for a child.\n\nYou were honest with them about the experience. They needed to know it isn't all sunshine and daisies for the child experiencing this.", "NTA. They made an incorrect assumption about an experience you had, and were getting ready to make significant decisions based on that wrong assumption. Correcting them was absolutely the right thing to do. If the rest of your family can't handle that, it's on them.", "NTA and anyone that doesn't think birth is traumatic is bonkers.  It involves lots of pain, lots of blood, and in many cases a lot of medical intervention to deal with or prevent major complications.  Woman produces hormones that help them deal with the trauma of producing a whole human.  Everyone else present has to just deal with it and adults can make that informed consent but a kid really doesn't get to and it sounds like the adults need that reality check.", "NTA your family has clearly been lying about how that experience was for you, frankly mad that they've been sharing it at all. You've not ruined anything for this couple, you've given the truth about your experience, what you may have ruined is their faith in anything your family tells them. I wonder how annoyed your family would be about your honesty if you hadn't showed them up.\n\nIt would have been better if you had gone \"actually my experience was this...\" because your phrasing was a bit harsh towards the couple, but it's really easy to pick apart someone's wording in hindsight, it's much harder to get it right in an emotional moment.", "NTA. They wanted their first child to have an expirence like yours. Clearly they were under an impression that you had a good expirence. You shined some truth on your expirence. Nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nVery mature of you that you were able to move on with your parents and hold no resentment for that mistake!!", "NTA, but your family continues to be the thoughtless AHs that you always knew they were.  The number of times it's been a good idea to have little children in the delivery room can probably be counted on the fingers of one finger.\n\n You saved a child from trauma, and you saved some parents for making a mistake that they could well regret for the rest of their lives. Why would they feel like bad parents? Because they had a bad idea? It's not like they had a chance to carry it out and then you informed them of the trauma they'd likely inflicted.  Your information was timely, on point, and badly needed. \n\n It's important that existing children feel involved in the general expectation of a new family member,  but that does not mean they should be required to be there for the birth.   You spoke your truth and hopefully it was heard.", "NTA. Maybe you could have framed your response a bit more kindly and explained your past experience, but at the end of the day you were making your feelings known about a terrible idea on the parents\u2019 part!

Sometimes, the truth hurts but it's YOUR truth and don't let anyone take that away from you, nor make you feel guilty about it.", "Super NTA, they brought you into it when they talked about how 'great' your experience was. That's basically carte blanche to share all of your opinions on the subject.", "NTA. My mother told me that if I ever have a child, I shouldn't be on that side of the curtain since apparently my father witnessed my birth and found the experience horrific.

You know more than they do how it can affect a kid. If they didn\u2019t want your honest opinion, they should not have brought it up.", "NTA.  I recall when a friend was telling us about giving birth. The doctors wheeled in a mirror. She said, \"What the hell is that for?\" They told her it was so she could see her baby being born. She said \"Get that out of here! Why would I want to see that!\"  Now, if a woman doesn't want to see that, I don't see why kids would. Men have fainted watching their wives give birth! Things have gone wrong My SIL had an emergency C-section. If they hadn't put up a curtain, I know my brother would have fainted. My dad said if he had been in the room (it was the 50's), there would not have had a second kid.\n\nNow, if these people want to record it (which is weird IMHO) and show it to their kid later, they can traumatize him at their leisure.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t \u2018ruin\u2019 the birth. If that caused them to rethink it so severely, they probably feel there\u2019s truth to it.

I\u2019m an adult and found medical photos of birth traumatizing. NOBODY should be exposing children to that, WTF are people thinking", "I'll say NTA. It was obviously very traumatizing for you, and your aunt was presenting it as if it had been some wonderful moment. You were merely pointing out that she was mistaken in her perception. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nBirth is not a spectator sport, especially for a person who cannot legally consent.", "NTA\n\nYou were abrupt, but the real AH (AHs?) here is anyone who\u2019s told this couple that you had a good experience in the first place. That\u2019s what led to them to making that comment about your experience, and you corrected them.\n\nCould you have been more tactful? Sure. You already had been by not saying anything before they referenced you directly. At that point you couldn\u2019t hold back.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin the birth. It hasn\u2019t happened yet.

And it would seem to be a good one.", "NTA", "NTA\n \nThey romanticized your experience or had it romanticized for them. You probably saved that kid the experience. You likely also opened their eyes.", "NTA my older brother was in the delivery room for my youngest brother but he WANTED to be there, he was 11. My mom and dad had him do SO MUCH research before even agreeing to it because they didn\u2019t want him traumatized!

For any soon-to-be first time fathers out there; yes, your wife/girlfriend/baby mama will indeed absolutely hate you with all of her being for a brief moment in time. But fear not, as long as you were treating her right beforehand she\u2019ll get over it fairly quickly. (The nurse discreetly asked if I needed someone to look at my hand afterward. Thankfully, I did not.)\n\nI wanted to see the \u201cbusiness end\u201d of the experience. This would be our last child and I wouldn\u2019t have another chance, I thought.

Abso-fucking-lutely. And somehow reminiscent of Alien.\n\nI still feel it was something I needed to do. I don\u2019t exactly regret it, but I would never do that to a small child.

Can\u2019t say I blame your for how you put, give how you and your experience were referred to in the moment.", "NTA. I witnessed that myself, though not as young. Still grosses me out, and I'm in my 30s. It's not a beautiful and magical moment to a child. The view is something from a horror movie. There is no need to expose a kid to that", "NTA.

You spoke the truth.", "NTA that couple was probably embarrassed they hadn\u2019t considered the potential outcome", "NTA. I gave birth twice. No way would I subject a 6 year old to that. Your response was just a reaction based on what they said and what you experienced. It wasn't some thought out plan to ruin their moment,  which isn't ruined. If they feel like bad parents, then that means they thought about your comment and decided you were right. That childbirth could be horrifying for a child. Not to mention if a medical emergency comes up..Otherwise, it would be a non issue.", "Jeezus.... What if it's not a healthy birth? My friend had her kid, then coded on the table.

Learn how to talk tactfully to people. \n\nThat was a jerky thing to blurt out. You could have calmly commented that you were present as a child at your brother's birth and you weren't prepared for how overwhelming childbirth could be, how traumatic it felt as a child, (blood, etc.) Say it CAREFULLY, don't verbally slap people for their idea..", "Soft YTA. You could have said what you wanted to say in a more diplomatic way. I'm not saying you \"ruined\" their birth since it hasn't happened yet. However you definitely ruined the couple's night.", "YTA. You could have told them about your experience without expressing it in such a negative way. Your experience is just one person's experience, and extrapolating that to everyone else is an AH move. Your point of view could have been a valuable contribution to their decision-making in a balanced way, but it wasn't at all. \n\nAs a caregiver, I've been to many births where children were present, and the vast majority were totally fine. My own daughter, 4 yo at the time, was at her sisters birth, and she loved being a part of it and still talks about it years later. It  depends on the age of the child, if too young, they are too scared and confused about what's happening, and if too old they might find it gross and they might not to want to see that. They need prep, info about what they might see and what might happen, and they need to have someone who is dedicated to helping them out, so if they want to leave, get tired or bored, they have someone to help them. I have them do little jobs, like keep a towel warm under their shirt to use to wipe off the baby. It's unfortunate that so many people on here have such a bad/limited view of childbirth. I'm not naive at all to complications that can happen, but it works just fine most of the time.", "Sorry, but I laughed out loud at this.  And before I dive in:  ESH.\n\nI \u201ccaught\u201d my younger sister.  I shit you not; I was\u2026 a month shy of 3 years old.   My older sister (5 years old), cut her umbilical cord.   \n\nThe particular OBGYN, who delivered 2 out of 3 of us, is an absolute legend.

You guessed it, they were willing.   And there\u2019s a funny story about me sitting just off the side of his knee as he was \u201cdelivering,\u201d and seeing a tiny head appear\u2026 and vocalizing \u201cdo we put the pieces together!?!?!?\u201d  \n\n(I\u2019m giggling, sorry).\n\nBut anyway, I never NOT knew what sex was, or how babies were made.  Or what happens generally when babies are \u201cready.\u201d  I always knew.   Now, I wasn\u2019t 6 years old at the time and while I do remember snippets of my sister\u2019s entry into this world, I only have one or two brief flashes of \u201cthat,\u201d AT BEST.  Or maybe it\u2019s because there were photos\u2026.. there were photos at some point.   \n\nAnyway- I say \u201cESH\u201d because it sounds like your parents wanted you to share the experience but didn\u2019t understand the gravity of being a 6 year old who was likely, ENTIRELY UNAWARE OF\u2026 ALL OF THAT.  \n\nAnd for you as well\u2026 but only the TINIEST BIT because despite the horrific trauma of THAT (which you need make no excuse for, WTF, darling, I\u2019m sorry!), you are traumatized to the point that you only associate childbirth with awful \u201call the things.\u201d  \n\nAs an adult?  You could not PAY ME to be in a delivery room.  FUCK THAT, I can\u2019t even watch Kill Bill without covering my eyes for half of it.  NOOOOOPE.  \n\nGodspeed, dear. (I\u2019m not even particularly religious but it sounds about right).", "ESH. \n\nYou have all the right on earth to talk about your life experience, you can even offer them your advice that maybe the parents should ask their child first and have them in the delivery room but not front row. \nBut it\u2019s just rude to piss on their parade and called it raining. They\u2019re excited about it and you just casually dismissed. \nThere are tons of way to tell your story, offer advice,vvv\u2026vv and you\u2019re passive aggressive with someone you don\u2019t even know. \n\nYour family are a h because they make a big deal of out a childish moment by blowing up your phone.", "I'm guessing there's not many people here who grew up on a farm.", "ESH You could have been better with how you presented your lived experience. No need for passive aggression. There are 100 ways to make the point without being so rude.\n\nThey suck for making a big deal of it. Unless they think you're in charge of their birth plan...

I will do a counter point, though (and it still doesn't make you an AH at all!): my brother was there for my birth when he was 6. Thought it was great, still thinks it great. Said it was a little yuck but also interesting and made him so excited and happy. But, my dad was very much a \"explain everything, use  REAL body terms, don't shield them from the other genders body terminology, let's actually talk about birth and no it wasn't a fucking stork.\". I think a number of factors could change your experience, oerson to person. Too many to list here. But a few are: is the mother in agony, or did she opt to use a form of pain management. How much biological info do you know about women. How many times did your parents talk about what will happen. What did they say specifically (ie: the baby lives in a little water balloon filled with water and even blood, so he can fill up with those important things!!! -yes I know not 100% accurate buuuut a great way to explain the blood and liquid so it is less scary, which is how it was explained to my brother.). .....Actually, I do remember one thing he WAS freaked out of though.. they forgot to explain the umbilical cord and he was briefly convinced they were about to cut off my penis (I am a female, and he thought they made a mistake and was really his little brother, not sister.

I cannot imagine gleefully _planning_ to put your kid in a position of seeing you in a position where you will be in pain, with lots of blood and everything else, where things can go poorly and turn into a dire situation in an instant. \n\nThat's so supremely messed up.

I don't even think home births let the other children watch.", "I mean I witnessed my cousin be born and thought it was cool. Maybe you should have just said some thing along the lines of \"maybe ask your child if they want to see that. and explain to them what it is\"  \n\n\nI wouldnt say you're an asshole. But you definitely could have worded it better.", "NTA! I was 19 when I watched my sister give birth, and it scarred me. I can't imagine doing that to a child, who really doesn't have the ability to say yes or no to that \"experience\".", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t even want to see myself give birth (if I had kids, but I don\u2019t want any) let alone subject a CHILD to seeing something so gruesome, news flash not everyone views birth as some magical experience because it\u2019s not, it\u2019s violent ugly painful and traumatising, sometimes even fatal. I know you said you made peace with it all but I\u2019m so sorry you ever had to in the first place.", "Dismissed? An adult...nope....I'd double down and get as vicious as possible. NTA...they are defective", "You are very much NTA.  I just had the privilege of being the emotional support person during labor and birth for my daughter's best friend.  It was an exhausting and exhilarating experience.  However, it was no place for a child!  Hopefully, you prevented another child from being emotionally traumatized.", "INFO: How old is that couple's first kid? Do they even know where babies come from yet?", "NTA. So fucked up to risk traumatizing a kid for a \u201cmoment\u201d", "Birth hasn't happened yet. You \"ruined\" nothing. Presumably the real joy lies in the birth of their new baby not in the elaborate fantasy they constructed. You gave them valuable advice. On the reasonable assumption that what they wanted was to share in their joy of a new baby with their current child, they can have the child enter room AFTER the baby is born and hold it. NTA.", "I was going into basic training. There was a dude that I traveled with so we chatted. He proceeded to show me photos (printed out; not Polaroids) of his baby being born. Every moment of the process. Luckily, the anxiety and stress of the training removed those images from my brain.\n\nTotally forgot this incident until reading this post. Weird how our brains work.", "NTA. Unless you want to use this as a form of birth control, just no. My parents were watching our 3 year old when I was in labor with our 2nd kid. They wanted to come to the hospital while I was in labor. I told them absolutely not, the nurses will refuse to let them in the room.

When I gave birth to my children my mom was there and said she was glad she had gas because it was so traumatizing to watch(I had long labors).\nMy son's ex asked me to be there for her when she had their baby. Honestly, watching labor as a spectator I finally got what my mother had been saying. OP is NTA. From a mother of two and a grandma!", "Absolutely unfathomable, especially since by definition they've been through this before and should know what goes on!

Seeing your parent hurt or in pain is extremely terrifying and confusing for a child.\n\nThere was a video on Reddit a couple months ago of a mother consoling her young daughter in the other room because apparently the little girl had overheard her parents having sex and thought her mom was hurt (kinda funny), but the fear in that little girls voice was SO real and she was clearly terrified that her mother was dying.\n\nIt\u2019s so inappropriate to put a child in this position.", "I think my extended family is just desensitized since all of them work with pregnancies and deliveries. Half of them manage that whole wing of the hospital which is why their friends kids keep getting the bring your kid to birth pass. \n\nIf this one kid gets to not be in that room and I'm to blame for that then I'll take the judgement but yeah", "Hormones 100% do not protect the woman from the trauma", "I agree with not bringing a kid into the room -- they're nowhere near ready to process what they're observing. But it's certainly not always traumatic for adults. My sister begged to be allowed to be present for my son's birth, because she knew she was never going to be able to have a baby herself and wanted at least to be part of the experience in some way. She said afterwards that it felt holy to her, and she was deeply grateful she could be there. \n\nAdults have reached the point where they have their own perspectives on childbirth -- perspectives which alter, one way or the other, the impressions they receive from direct viewing. Those perspectives can make the feeling either better or worse, depending on what they involve. But children don't have anything except the direct sensory input, and that's going to be awful for them without anything else to help them come to terms with it emotionally.", "I wonder if those people had actually seen a childbirth (remember those films we had to watch in health class?) Or if they just saw them on TV shows.", "I\u2019m going to have to disagree cause OPs family is absolutely full of AHs", "Yeah, definitely didn't ruin the birth - it hasn't even happened yet. And I think you're correct, they are realizing there is some truth to it. Also, if their reflection on the entire birth is dependent upon their first child being in there and reacting the way they expect/want, they've got some awfully odd priorities and that's entirely on them. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure I can agree with your judgement - I'd say the extended family are AHs here as they are ignorantly trying to dictate how people should be taking in and reacting to a very specific scenario. And I would also argue OP is doing that to some degree too - she has assumed the \"first child\" will be traumatized by the experience, but not everyone is affected by blood and the like the same way. We don't even know how old the first child is, if they were say, 11 or 12 then there's an extremely good chance they would see it differently than OP did at 6. \n\nI think this is closer to a ESH or NTA judgement here.", "I get that but how many people react perfectly to things like that which involve trauma? I think OP dealt with it really well all things considered. Definitely NTA :)", "She was caught off guard and triggered!

Let's just hope OP prevented it.", "[deleted]", "Big difference between a farm animal and your mom. \n\nDipping back into my anthropology days: Are you aware that humans are the only animals on earth who regularly need assistance to give birth? Our heads are so damn big they often won't fit through the birth canal. We've come to an evolutionary impasse because female hips can't get any wider without affecting our ability to walk. Many women and children had died down the  millennia because baby's head was so big mom couldn't push it out", "Zero relevance to the context here.", "I never have seen that much blood, pee and shit in my whole life. I didn't even remember my brother I just know the amount of body fluids I was seeing was so gross.", "As a 6-year old? Seriously?", "Why do you need clarification as to what traumatized OP??", "Yes. Watching someone give birth is traumatizing. You are so useless. You\u2019re watching someone in pain and are literally useless", "Ahh, yeah, that explains it. When you work in health care you don't even notice the blood and gore. It just becomes background noise of whatever important task you are doing.", "Stand your ground, write them a letter about it. If you get to stop this kid from having to be apart of that, then you\u2019re a hero in my book. Since they\u2019re desensitized to it, appeal to how it was when you were a child, along with if they weren\u2019t in that business, and especially them as kids, how it\u2019s effect them. Most kids are scared of even getting a shot, and seeing blood freaks them out, how does it make sense that a little kid would be fine with seeing much worse happen to their mother?? Also point out if something wrong happens. Do they really want their kid to witness their mother getting ripped from her V to her A? Or Lord forbid have to have an emergency C section and be sitting there freaked out if they\u2019re moms going to okay when she has to get wheeled away for emergency surgery?? And if they argue that \u2018oh we\u2019ll make sure they don\u2019t see the gore\u2019 help them recognize that they\u2019ll still be fully aware of it as the doctors will be talking about it, nurses taking away bloody cloths and such, but moreover, do they really want their child witnesses their mother in that much physical pain. It\u2019s scary as a kid when your parents have normal low key fights, much less seeing them in extreme physical pain! \n\nKeep reminding them that they may be desensitized, but a small child is not!! Let the poor kid have a childhood.", "Can confirm", "I was apparently one of the lucky ones as my school didn't do a video.

Traumatized people don\u2019t have to be perfect but is perfectly valid for someone to point out that you can make a much more convincing argument (or simply speak your truth in a way that lands with people) if you find enough peace within yourself to deliver your messages with grace.", "Tbh there is nothing wrong for them to be excited about it :)", "Yep. Similar stuff happens on farms too. We were pretty familiar with our local vet as some of them needed help getting the calf out.", "Disagree. He\u2019s assuming anyone would be traumatized the way he was. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. So what exactly traumatized him about his experience? Is there a reasonable precaution that can be taken? Was his experience totally unique?", "It sounds like you watched the birth directly. It is possible to be in the delivery room and not see all of that. If their goal is for the child to be part of the experience there may be a way to do that without all of the brutal exposure", "Because, as OP clarified in response to the comment, she was traumatized by the way she was exposed directly to 100% of the birth process, not just from being in the delivery room. It\u2019s possible for her family to have a child in the delivery room while not giving it the same experience she had", "I can second that", "I'm a female but go on.", "Have you not heard how teenagers react to watching a birth video in health? Traumatized. Imagine being six and not having any understanding of body anatomy down there.", "Ironically I think we agree that OP deserves some YTA credit here for their approach. Why they were traumatized is not relevant considering they misstepped before having to explain or articulate why they discourage it.\n\nAs someone who has had to manage the emotions of watching the woman I love push a person out of her body several times. Knowing the stress and difficulty of being powerless to help someone you care so much about... I would never suggest a child have to witness their mother in that situation if it can be avoided.\n\nSo not only is it not relevant, but to most people who have seen the process... It's obvious.", "if there\u2019s a risk of traumatizing a child, is it worth it?\n\nWhat if the mother has a medical emergency, or the baby doesn\u2019t make it?

I responded to your comment directly but basically if seeing all of the blood and body fluids is what traumatized you, there\u2019s ways to shield the child from all of that while still having them present. It sounds like you were given a front row seat to the entire process which is understandably traumatic for a child", "I mean OP did say that they referred to making the moment as magical as it was for her. What did they want her to do, lie? Then blame her later if their kid is traumatized like she is? Maybe OPs family should be more honest with that fact that is was traumatizing for her instead of telling others it was this great moment that they will forever want to relive.", "I understand and your experience sounds terrible. But what I am trying to say is there is a way to have a child in the delivery room without giving them the experience you endured", "I think you lost the thread here. Never said anything you're suggesting. The thread is asking OP to explain why they're traumatized. I'm saying they don't have to.\n\nI'm squarely in the ESH, but OP only mildly so because of their anti-social way of responding.", "Women make horrible noises when they give birth. Things can go wrong. It could end up being an emergency c section. Sorry but it's not right to do that to a kid"]}
