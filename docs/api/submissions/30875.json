She expressed needing to get away a bit since she had a nasty divorce. And since I was already heading home for a week, I invited her to come visit since she's never been. I let her know that we'll still be staying at a hotel because my family home doesn't have space for us at the moment. My brother's wife had a baby and they're staying with my parents for a few weeks. \n\nBrandy was really excited and I was really excited. She's always talked about how she missed living in Chinatown and how she missed Chinese food and how she missed seeing diverse faces. She currently lives and work in a predominantly white suburban neighborhood. \n\nIt was a mistake. My parents welcomed Brandy and to celebrate me coming home, they took us all out to dinner at their favorite Chinese restaurant. But dinner ended in disaster when the dishes arrived and I helpes Brandy take a little of everything so she can try them. She started complaining. Pulling disgusted faces, scrunching up her face, shaking her head. Everything was either too sweet, too much sauce, too much sugar, too mushy, and \"I don't eat this kind of vegetables.\" \n\nIt was highly embarassing. She sat in front of my entire family and pulled all these faces and said it loud enough that wait staff and other tables heard her declaring the food was disgusting or tastes wrong. But I held my tongue and we got through dinner. I let it go since she went through a nasty divorce and I figured I should cut her some slack. \n\nThe next day, I took her out for some shopping. To cheer her up. She was fine for the most of the day. But then when we got to dinner, she started complaining again about how the food was too sweet and how she can't eat this and can't eat that. And then she went off on the waiter for taking her plate away when he asked her if she was done and she whispered \"no\" under her breath. The waiter didn't know much English so I stepped in and told her he didn't hear her and next time, if they didn't hear you, just put your hand on top of the plate and they'll know you want to keep it. She went off saying that wasn't an excuse and the people here need to learn how to do their jobs properly. \n\nThat was it for me. I told her to please leave and go home. She is no longer welcomed to stay with me. Brandy got further upset and yelled at me for abandoning her in a town she doesn't know and that she's not leaving. So I packed up my stuff at the hotel and went to my parents' house. \n\nBrandy texted me earlier, calling me an asshole bitch and said she'll tell all our friends about how I abandoned her and treated her like shit in my hometown.", "created_utc": 1699824115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tu48n/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_was_embarassing_me/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We're talking about a 33 yo grown ass woman here that was left in a presumably paid for hotel! As for the sweetness of the food, reading between the lines, OPs family took her out for Chinese food, or rather, Americanized Chinese food, which tends to be much sweeter and nowhere near like authentic Chinese food. This lady sat there and was rude, demanding and mean, not just once but twice in a 2 day period. She's lucky she didn't get cussed out.", "I get ya.
