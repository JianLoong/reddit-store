{"id": 27469, "submission_id": "16q8mo4", "title": "AITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?", "selftext": "My husband & I talked about daycare & how our schedules would work since we both work full time. It was agreed that his parents would babysit mon-sat & my parents would babysit Sundays, when needed. Of course his mom was thrilled to be the main care taker (she retired purposely for this). I ended up having a very complicated pregnancy where my daughter had to be born 3 months early. She was in the NICU for 6 months. I had to go back to work after 8 weeks & saved the rest of my time for when she was discharged. It was rough to say the least.\n\nOnce she was discharged, all she kept talking about was how she couldn\u2019t wait to babysit & that her \u201cplayroom\u201d was ready for her & if I ever needed to run errands I could leave my daughter with her. But I\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited / dangerous. This was me & my husbands time as a family to bond together.\n\nTo make a long story short, my entire leave she would not stop harassing us to have a conversation about expectations when she\u2019s babysitting. If we\u2019re picky about diapers, a sleep schedule etc. I told him I felt like she\u2019s just rushing us back to work & I didn\u2019t appreciate it. I told my husband I\u2019m honestly not that picky. I will provide her with everything she will need & that she\u2019d only be watching her for 2-3 hrs a day anyway (we have opposite work schedules). My only main concerns were that I did not want her giving my daughter ANY medication (she\u2019s already on meds) & that I don\u2019t want her driving her anywhere.\n\nSo this is where I\u2019m questioning AITA.. IMO, she\u2019s just too young to do anything or go anywhere (her adjusted age is 5 months old) & something we both agree on is that my MIL is a horrible driver. Not that she\u2019s a reckless driver, but the opposite. She\u2019s such an overly cautious driver that she causes other cars to stop short or she gets honked at all the time & cut off. She\u2019s the driver in the left hand lane going 45 MPH on the highway. We just honestly don\u2019t feel safe with her driving anywhere especially if it\u2019s not needed. She just wants to take her out to show her off & have \u201cplay dates\u201d with the other family babies (I\u2019ve heard her trying to set up these playdates & stopped her once telling her she won\u2019t be provided with a car seat) Well my husband ended up going to talk to her without me & pretty much the conversation went sour. She did not like being told that she can\u2019t \u201cever leave the house\u201d he reminded her that she\u2019s only baby sitting for 2-3 hrs, 2-3x/week. He really fought for this, to the point where she said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m providing you with free daycare, I\u2019ll take her where ever I want or you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d My MIL was so eager to babysit & now wants to play this power card of \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want since I\u2019m not charging you\u201d attitude. \n\nAITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?\n\nUpdate:\n\nI sincerely appreciate all the feedback! I didn't want to make this post TOO long to read so I will clarify some common concerns.\n1. My husband does not have a set schedule and I make my own schedule. I try to make my days off, days he is working. So with my husband off 2 days a week and myself off 2 days a week, we would only need her to be watched for 3 days of the week. Also I typically work in the morning and he works nights which is again why it would only be for 2-3 hrs. He leaves for work at 4p and I'm typically home by 5p, 6\u0440 the latest.\n2. Major one I should have mentioned.. My FIL doesn't work. He is home 24/7 and absolutely respects all our our wishes. Unfortunately because he never worked, it's that type of relationship where whatever my MIL says goes.. we've asked him separately that if she wants to take her anywhere, for HIM to drive but he knows he has no control over that decision. So she also wouldn't be \"locked up in the house\" because he can just watch her as she goes out.\n3. My husband and I have had a conversation about emergencies. My in laws live next door to us and have access to our house. (Which is another boundary we are working on with her) So I explained to my husband that the car seat is available to her in emergencies. (It\u2019s the stroller/ car seat convertible so it comes in and out of the car) But if there was a TRUE massive emergency, she should be calling me or my pediatrician and they dispatch an ambulance. We live in a suburb and the hospital is 5 mins away from us, and ambulances are quick. My MIL gets too anxious when driving and under an emergency is even worse. Anytime someone tries to critique her driving, she doesn\u2019t think anything she does is wrong. She argued that she hasn\u2019t been in an accident in 20 years (meanwhile she hit a pediatrician just a few years ago and didn\u2019t think she was in the wrong) unfortunately ever since I\u2019ve known her, she believes she is truly never in the wrong and always abides by the law.\n4. I absolutely do not mind people going to her. I would prefer it but again she is still a baby and am more comfortable with this in the future when she is older. The play date she was trying to set up, she mentioned going to her house which is a 45 min drive.\n5. I don\u2019t have an awful relationship with my MIL and I am grateful for her to babysit, but my husband has grown up with her always trying to control his life. Ex: before my daughter was born, my husband traded in his 2 door car for a 4 door car for obvious reasons. She tried convincing him to just sell the car, that we don\u2019t need 2 vehicles. It was a waste of money and that if we ever did need a second car, FIL is home and he can take his car. Yet there have been multiple occasions where we see neither of their car is home and we now have an inside joke about it) but that\u2019s the power card she always tries to pull. She doesn\u2019t think I bring an income home and everything is a waste of money. \n6. We didn\u2019t ask her to retire to be our babysitter. She made that decision and told us that she would be more than excited to babysit. She was a teacher and after covid with all the new technologies and having to do video classes, she just had enough. \n\nI will add I don't think my husband clarified that this is just while she's a baby. Of course as she gets older and is more active (and medically stable) she can take her out on days I will be gone longer. \n\nI just grew up in a family where everyone helps everyone with no strings attached or just returning favors in other ways but it\u2019s never expected.", "created_utc": 1695486105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q8mo4/aita_for_my_only_demand_to_be_not_to_take_my_baby/", "score": 705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also unsafe, in some emergency where MIL needs to take your child in a car.\n\n--->Find other childcare. Neither you nor your MIL can handle this.<---", "I am going to go against the grain here and say that for you to ask that your MIL does not take the baby out of the house for the brief periods she is babysitting is A REASONABLE request. My Grandson was born at 23.5 weeks and was in NICU for 125 days. When he finally came home, he was in and out of hospital. The only two safe spaces for him to be (beside hospital) was his home and my place. Both places were prepared and kept clean for him to grow and nurture in safety.\n\nWhen my last grandbaby girl was born and I was called upon to mind her 2 days per week, I did not take her out (and she was a full term baby). I had a car baby seat for emergencies but it was not necessary to take her out. It's only now that she is 2 years old that sometimes we go out for \"lunch\" at a cafe or to meet a friend for a short while. \n\nI do not think you are a TA for requesting that the MIL stays home while minding your child. At least for the foreseeable future until the child is older. It certainly seems that your MIL is more interested in showing off the child rather than taking care of the child.", "NTA\n\nFind somebody else. Even if she agrees, she\u2019s only going to do it to shut you both up, then do what she wants anyway.

Talk about hypocrisy. \n\nAnd premature babies need longer to build their immune systems, so shouldn\u2019t be around other children too much.

Ngl, I was ready to give you the y t a but under these circumstances your request is 100% reasonable.\n\nShe\u2019ll only have the baby for 2-3 hours. Baby has significant health problems. MiL is an unsafe driver. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to give ultimatums and expect them to be followed. You could let her know one more time what your conditions are and that they can be revisited in six months. If she agrees, give it a shot. \n\nBut frankly you may want to bypass that and find another option for baby care. I can\u2019t say if my experience is universal but grandparents like this often disregard the parents\u2019 wishes and do things on the sly.", "OK, so you know that she can buy a carseat Target or WalMart, right? \n\nFYI \"free\" babysitters ALWAYS come at a \"cost\" of some kind.  You say your inlaws are babysitting 2-3 hours M thru Sat -- but later say she's only babysitting 2 or 3 days a week.  Which of those is true?", "ESH\n\nIt's a bit over-controlling to say she can't go out of the house. No kidding she doesn't like it. Can she walk? Can people come over for said play dates or whatever? Can they be done at your house? \n\nObv your concern around her driving is... valid... if she has been in accidents of any form before? (Has she?) And even then, if it's agreed by many that she's just very bad at it, fair enough.\n\nAnd yeah it's a bit overdramatic to act as though she is providing ALL the daycare given it seems to be in the range of 4-9 hours a week. \n\nYou both need to settle down and meet in the middle here.", "NTA  \n\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m providing you with free daycare, I\u2019ll take her where ever I want or you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d \n\nFind someone else.  \n\n\nThis is a huge red flag that she's not respecting your boundaries.", "If you want an employee you're going to have to pay one.", "I\u2019m confused because you say you don\u2019t want her to go anywhere because she has a weak immune system, but you also say \u201cI\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited.\u201d Those two things don\u2019t make sense together. Her immune system isn\u2019t stronger or weaker based on who she\u2019s with. So that excuse doesn\u2019t make sense. You can say you prefer she doesn\u2019t go some places where maybe there would be more germs (kiddie playgrounds for example) until she\u2019s a bit older, but if you can take her on errands, why can\u2019t MIL? \n\nAs for the other stuff, it is perfectly reasonable for her to want to know what your preferences are so she can prepare and so she can abide by them. It seems like she had every intention of doing things your way, she just needed to know what your way was *which is completely fair.* the only time she pushed back was when you said she can\u2019t leave the house, which I agree is unreasonable if you\u2019re taking your daughter places with you. \n\nMaybe tell her you prefer if she takes your daughter anywhere that it is close by (no highway driving), I think that would be a fair compromise. Her driving style wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem in a residential area where the speed limits are fairly slow anyway. Not giving her a car seat is also a terrible idea, what if there\u2019s an emergency? \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s your baby, but I think she\u2019s trying to do a nice thing for her and you\u2019re taking your sadness about going back to work and your anxiety out on her when she\u2019s just trying to help you. So I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but YTA for me.", "I get it, my twins were born at 26 weeks and in the NICU for 3 months. When they got home on heart and lung moniters and oxygen and lots of medication, I didn't let anyone over to see them and I didn't go out except for doctors appointments. Your child is very vulnerable. You do not want them to be exposed to any more germs/viruses than necessary. So no, Mom doesn't get to take your child out and see other kids, it really is too dangerous for their immune systems. I agree, a car seat is needed just in case, but she has to be onboard to just be staying at home for a few months.", "NTA.  Your baby's health is still fragile and your MIL has no business taking her out for \"play dates.\"  Exposing the child to people outside of her immediate family is dangerous at this time.  Enlist your pediatrician on this issue.  Give your MIL a note stating that the baby cannot be taken out in public until X age.  And if you don't trust your MIL's driving, don't back down on this.  Would you rather have a child injured in a car accident or a MIL who is pissed off?", "I\u2019m a grandmother that has kept my grands from birth. I have my own car seats, and fortunately not driving with the baby was never one of the parents\u2019 rules. I can tell you that being excited about taking the baby places verses actually taking the baby are two very different things. The logistics of packing the supplies and putting the baby in and out of the car seat are harder when you\u2019re the grandparent. You may be making a big deal unnecessarily. I find myself avoiding leaving with them for those reasons. \n\nYou do need to sit down and make some ground rules on both sides. Some issues we have worked through: Feeding and spoiling the kids and parents late for pick up.  Remember she is taking time out of her day to do you a favor. Yes, she\u2019ll enjoy the baby, but it is still a huge commitment.", "ESH. So you suck because MIL asking questions on your preferences is normal and you shouldn\u2019t view it so negatively. She retired and is going to take care of a child everyday for the foreseeable future which is hard work. I think you were unnecessarily nasty about that situation. If I were doing that for someone else\u2019s baby, I would want to know everything they like or don\u2019t like.\n\nMIL sucks because the power card of \u201cwell I\u2019m watching baby for free so I can do what I want\u201d is stupid. You\u2019re the parent, it\u2019s your say whether you\u2019re there or not. Your baby is still not really old enough to go anywhere. Idk if this would be ok, but if MIL wants to show off baby, it shouldn\u2019t be somewhere outside the home, people should come to the baby if you even decide it\u2019s ok. If MIL doesn\u2019t want to follow your rules, fine, you\u2019ll figure out other arrangements.

Same applies to MIL", "NTA - all of your concerns are valid. \n\n5 month olds do not have \u201cplay dates\u201d - mommy groups are more about the mommies than the babies at that age. \n\nExtra caution may be necessary, given the baby was premature and is on medication. \n\nI find MIL\u2019s lack of deference troubling- you and your husband\u2019s instructions regarding how to care for your child need to be respected and followed. It sounds like she had everything planned in her mind as to how she was going to do things, without really listening to your expectations- even though she asked. Do you have a plan b?", "Wait, you were angry with her when you were on maternity leave and she tried to discuss what your expectations and rules were for the baby once she took over watching your daughter? That sounds like good communication and very respectful: she was literally trying to respect your parenting rules and make sure she complied. You might want to consider that you\u2019re taking out your feelings about other things on your MIL. She\u2019s providing free childcare/trying to communicate with you and find out what you want. You\u2019re being rigid and unkind and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the \u201cwe won\u2019t be providing a car seat and you\u2019re not allowed to leave the house while doing me a huge favor while I am being unpleasant to you.\u201d", "I think you both have been through a lot with your little one and feel understandably protective and cautious. You may have feelings of deep anxiety about losing her considering the challenges to bring her into the world. Again, I can validate the feeling.  But your fears need to be kept in check in such a way that they don't impede on areas of other people's lives that would otherwise be totally normal or acceptable.  It's projecting those fears on others in a way that ends up being controlling and alienating.  \n\nI think if you both had those concerns pre birth re: your mil's driving ability then she should not have been in your minds at all for daily child care.  That's a massive commitment on her part and it shouldn't be taken for granted considering how much work it is for someone that is past middle age. So to then dictate terms that are so punitive in nature just seems a bit harsh. \n\nNot sure if you can find a balance there with the situation unless some form of compromise can be had on both sides.  Perhaps you can ask that your baby not be in large group settings for the first year? Or something akin to that.", "NTA but free daycare is never free.

If you paid for daycare you must trust the workers to keep your child safe. Would you trust her more if you had not gone through the trauma of having a preemie?

I had a preemie myself, and he went everywhere from the time he got home. Unless your daughter has some serious health complications, then she should be fine to go out with your MIL.

I didn\u2019t want to make this post TOO long to read so I will clarify some common concerns. \n1) My husband does not have a set schedule and I make my own schedule. I try to make my days off, days he is working. So with my husband off 2 days a week and myself off 2 days a week, we would only need her to be watched for 3 days of the week. Also I typically work in the morning and he works nights which is again why it would only be for 2-3 hrs. He leaves for work at 4p and I\u2019m typically home by 6p. \n2) My husband and I have had a conversation about emergencies. My in laws live next door to us and have access to our house. (Which is another boundary we are working on with her) So I explained to my husband that the car seat is available to her in emergencies. But if there was a TRUE massive emergency, she should be calling me and my pediatrician dispatches an ambulance. 3) I absolutely do not mind people going to her! I would prefer it. The play date she was trying to set up, she mentioned going to her house which is a 45 min drive.\n4) Major one I should have mentioned.. My FIL doesn\u2019t work. He is home 24/7 and absolutely respects all our our wishes. Unfortunately because he never worked, it\u2019s that type of relationship where whatever my MIL says goes.. we\u2019ve asked him separately that if she wants to take her anywhere, for HIM to drive but he knows he has no control over that decision. So she also wouldn\u2019t be \u201clocked up in the house\u201d because he can just watch her as she goes out. \n\nI will add I don\u2019t think my husband clarified that this is just while she\u2019s a baby.

It was agreed that his parents would babysit mon-sat & my parents would babysit Sundays, when needed. Of course his mom was thrilled to be the main care taker (she retired purposely for this). I ended up having a very complicated pregnancy where my daughter had to be born 3 months early. She was in the NICU for 6 months. I had to go back to work after 8 weeks & saved the rest of my time for when she was discharged. It was rough to say the least.\n\nOnce she was discharged, all she kept talking about was how she couldn\u2019t wait to babysit & that her \u201cplayroom\u201d was ready for her & if I ever needed to run errands I could leave my daughter with her. But I\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited / dangerous. This was me & my husbands time as a family to bond together.\n\nTo make a long story short, my entire leave she would not stop harassing us to have a conversation about expectations when she\u2019s babysitting. If we\u2019re picky about diapers, a sleep schedule etc. I told him I felt like she\u2019s just rushing us back to work & I didn\u2019t appreciate it. I told my husband I\u2019m honestly not that picky. I will provide her with everything she will need & that she\u2019d only be watching her for 2-3 hrs a day anyway (we have opposite work schedules). My only main concerns were that I did not want her giving my daughter ANY medication (she\u2019s already on meds) & that I don\u2019t want her driving her anywhere.\n\nSo this is where I\u2019m questioning AITA.. IMO, she\u2019s just too young to do anything or go anywhere (her adjusted age is 5 months old) & something we both agree on is that my MIL is a horrible driver. Not that she\u2019s a reckless driver, but the opposite. She\u2019s such an overly cautious driver that she causes other cars to stop short or she gets honked at all the time & cut off. She\u2019s the driver in the left hand lane going 45 MPH on the highway. We just honestly don\u2019t feel safe with her driving anywhere especially if it\u2019s not needed. She just wants to take her out to show her off & have \u201cplay dates\u201d with the other family babies (I\u2019ve heard her trying to set up these playdates & stopped her once telling her she won\u2019t be provided with a car seat) Well my husband ended up going to talk to her without me & pretty much the conversation went sour. She did not like being told that she can\u2019t \u201cever leave the house\u201d he reminded her that she\u2019s only baby sitting for 2-3 hrs, 2-3x/week. He really fought for this, to the point where she said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m providing you with free daycare, I\u2019ll take her where ever I want or you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d My MIL was so eager to babysit & now wants to play this power card of \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want since I\u2019m not charging you\u201d attitude. \n\nAITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, you were recovering, but it was obviously an important question in retrospect.

Sit down with your MIL, and tell her how scary NICU was, and that for NOW, you'd like her to stay home with the baby, while you're still adjusting. And that you can revisit it when you're feeling a little bit better, but right now, this is what you want. And at the end of the day, your MIL can disagree with your choices, and that's ok, she has a right to disagree. BUT that she can't change them. You love that she wants to be incredibly involved in your babies life, And you want that too. But at the end of the day, she is not your child's parent. And it's the child's parents who make the decisions of what they do and do not want their child doing. And that if she is going to be involved in this child's life she needs to understand and respect that. Because starting off a relationship in this child's life, by basically saying \"I don't care what the parents think I want to do whatever the heck I want to do and if not then tough cookies\" doesn't bode well with a healthy relationship where you feel like you can trust her with your child. \n\n\nNow on the outside of this as well,  regardless of what your mother-in-law thinks of your choice, she doesn't get any say in changing it.

Plus it's an extra step to have to call the dispatch and have them send one out when you could more easily already be on the way to the hospital. \n\nAmbulances are great if an adult is by themselves or is unable to be moved. For a baby? Driving them will always be safer unless they are physically hurt some way that prevents moving them.", "There's a lot of situations where a baby needs to go to the ER but doesn't need an ambulance. Our baby had to go in at 2 days for dehydration and we drove. \n\nI drove myself to the ER last week. I needed a CT scan to rule it an emergency surgery but I was fine to drive.\n\nFor the first couple months any fever is a trip to the ER but you don't have to take an ambulance they just want to monitor for meningitis etc.", "When the infant preemie you\u2019re caring for is having a health issue waiting for an ambulance is not the call. Kids who can\u2019t drive babysitting is a product of a bygone era. This isn\u2019t public school\u2014 that\u2019s his grandma, who clearly OP doesn\u2019t like, but who loves her grandson and has raised at least one of her own. \n\nIdk buy a stroller and let her take the baby for walks? Walks are great at the age.", "It sounds like the MiL drives so slow that she could just pass the baby to an ambulance \u201con the fly\u201d.", "I'm in Germany, so it might not be relevant for the US, but we even had to provide our car seat for the ambulance. The alternative (since our seat was LATCH only, which the ambulance didn't have) was to have me laying on the stretcher with the baby strapped to my chest.", "Agreed, she's a grandma who wants to show off. It's not at all worth the risk, she's being selfish.", "Yes but has the developement of a 5 month old baby given the baby was born literally 3 months early", "I think when you have kids, you know so much about this stuff that you just assume other people do as well. Like to a lot of us, it would be immediately obvious that a 5 months adjusted preemie would have a very weak immune system and need to be protected more, and that's not something she needs to say in her post because it's so obvious. It's just included in the part about her being a micro-preemie that she is medically fragile and more likely to die or be seriously injured from common childhood infections than most babies", "Bruuh she literally explained her baby was born prematurely and her adjusted age was 5 months old. Even if the baby was born within the expected timeframe, wtf is your business taking out a 5 month old on play dates when the mother disagrees and you're watching it for 3 hours tops. At 5 months old babies don't even have all their vaccinations done. It's a literal newborn who is also extra vulnerable. MIL is definitely just trying to brag in the neighbourhood about being a grandma and that's why she's so eager to do this. She needs to know her place.", "BRUH I don't know where they are. We don't know how old the child actually is.  Mainly bc we don't know how long the mom was on leave. In Canada, she'd be off at least 9 months.\n\nAND AGAIN - NO mention of this concern by OP. OP is concerned about the DRIVING.", "I'm not saying they won't be trained better, I'm sure they will be.  Frankly, I'm sure they're training makes them more qualified than the mother to take care of that baby, yet no one would argue that a trained professional should take over for a mom (or dad) because that's not what child rearing is about.  If something happens to those parents, who do you think will be the first people to step in an help?  Or even possibly raise those children?  One of my coworkers and her husband were killed in a car accident (not their fault) and now the grandparents are the guardians; not the nanny.  \n\n(And yes, I know there are some families that have monsters, that's not what I'm talking about.", "You're right, staying inside for 3 whole hours out of her day might just kill her. She definitely needs to take the delicate preemie anywhere and everywhere, unsafe driving be damned!", "I really don\u2019t think this is true outside of an extremely rural area. Infants, and I\u2019m taking actual babies not toddlers that are requiring of an ER visit are going to be way better equipped in the hands of professionals. Im thinking the types of scenarios that would warrant an infant in the ER RIGHT NOW are going to be what someone else commented - not breathing, lethargic, etc you do NOT want to be the one getting a baby in a car seat alone through all that. Most dispatchers will tell you to remain where you are and attempt CPR until help arrives. We\u2019re not talking a toddler breaking a bone or needing a stitch. Driving is NOT safer in many if not most of those infant cases. I can\u2019t imagine anyone in their right mind attempting to drive a choking infant in a car seat vs calling 911 for an ambulance.", "There would be NO one to sit in the back seat to monitor the baby and their vitals.  However, I was taught if possible to always secure a child in their  carseat to the gurney.  Also rigs are always stocked with pediatric supplies.", "No, it really is not always safer even when the driver in question is a safe and responsible driver, especially when dealing with an infant or small child. I\u2019ve been a nanny to kids with asthma and allergies. Administering first aid at the dispatcher\u2019s direction while waiting for an ambulance is preferred to driving a baby that is literally suffocating. There are a lot of emergency medical issues where this is the case. However, all that aside, OP\u2019s MIL isn\u2019t a safe driver. Her driving the infant is just adding more danger to an already emergency situation.", "Driving them is *not* always 100% safer. Can you prevent an ill preemie from aspirating their vomit? What about monitoring respirations. Are you planning to provide CPR while driving?", "The fact that *some* people live in places where ambulances take longer to get to does not mean that *all* people should rely on an unsafe driver to drive their infant to the ER instead of calling one. What? Also, \u201cfind phone, call 911\u201d is like. Two steps? Three if you count \u201clisten to dispatcher for further instructions\u201d I guess. Ask a parent how many steps are in their *normal* leaving the house routine- I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a lot more than three.", "I mean currently where I am in the uk wait times for ambulance is anything from 5 to 9 hours...that might go down slightly for a child...but realistically if their is a wait their is a wait. Your more likely to get an air ambulance in my region but generally you have to wait for a ground medical examination by a fly team first. So realistically it would still be faster and their for probably safer to get the kid in a car and just drive", "Urgent but not emergent care certainly can require going to the ER, but it\u2019s also not a race to get there like with an asthma attack or a car accident. For a situation like that, MIL could just call the parents and have them handle transport. Especially given OP said she\u2019d only be watching the baby for 2-3 hours at a time.", "Maybe grandma could also call an Uber or have another relative drive? If my kids were uncomfortable with my driving I would accept that but there are other ways to get to the park or where ever. Granma was out of line with her 'free babysitting' comment but sounds like they are a bit overbearing.", "This seems absurd. What if you\u2019re out with your infant on a walk in their stroller? What if you don\u2019t even have a car hence no need of a car seat?", "I believe this is the case here in the UK. My daughter and son in law don't have a car but they have car seats, and have been required to use one in an ambulance a few times.", "While it varies from one place to the next if they have them, there are harness/restraints made specifically for ambulances to transport infants and children. The car seats can be better/easier, especially when the baby was in a car accident and so already in the seat, but like you said, if they don\u2019t have a car seat/can\u2019t use the car seat for some reason, they have an alternative. They\u2019re not going to refuse to take the baby because there is no car seat.", "I was nationaly certified as a EMT and we are taught to strap babies in their carseats in the ambulance. There should be a way to attach with lap belt through under the back or there is groozes on the front.", "I'm sorry this happened to you but I did get a giggle at imagining how they figured that out lol carseat doesn't work \"okay Tom hold baby Jacob like this now lie back and we'll strap you in\" during an emergency but that does seem like the next most effective way to go in that scenario lol", "All of this and OP mentioned baby already being on medication. Meaning baby has lingering health concerns....", "OP *literally* said:\n\n\"But I\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited / dangerous.\"", "Except it\u2019s really not OP\u2019s concern. Reread the second paragraph. \n\nOP was also upset her MIL was offering to babysit when they ran errands (before MIL was to begin babysitting) because OP said she (OP) had no issues taking her baby anywhere and viewed it as her and her husband\u2019s time to bond as a family", "Got it.", "Let's get real, if they're the average person, I'm not sure they're capable of suctioning or providing adequate CPR to an infant even if they stayed put. Most people are only vaguely familiar with adult CPR because it's depicted in media. I can't think of a time I ever saw an infant getting compressions of TV. Further, I'd guess the vast majority of parents don't even know where an infant's pulse points are.\n\nAlso, if you're giving CPR to an infant outside of a facility, chance of achieving rosc is minimal. At that point, waiting vs driving is going to be pretty much equal outcomes.", "Home health care nurses are specifically told not to drive a patient in distress to the hospital because you can't drive and take care of your patient.", "What makes you think they'd be able to do any of them even while not driving?", "Because you assume the ambulance will be significantly quicker arriving to the house than the grandmother would be able to drive to the hospital?", "What are you going to do while waiting thirty minutes for an ambulance to come when the baby is aspirating?", "I was on the stretcher and had my baby strapped onto me because our car seat used only latch, no seat belt.", "Then you have to wait for a special infant equipped ambulance to be available, not all of them are.", "For infant bucket seats yes, but there are many convertible seats which are latch only.", "But the grandma wasn't gonna just bring the baby out to the park or something low risk, she wanted to bring her on playdates. (which is also like ?? at an age where they're not even capable of parallel play yet) OP didn't word it very clearly but I took that part to mean they like to bring their baby out for safe/ low risk outings, but grandma is trying to do something high risk for no benefit", "For a baby that early I wouldn't be surprised if the parents had to have a pretty thorough infant CPR course in order to bring her home. \n\nI'm surprised that wasn't a condition of grandma watching baby honestly, it was when I watched a preemie. \n\nBut I wouldn't be able to drive my infant safely during that kind of emergency anyway. Or any infant! Let the pros drive my kid.", "You\u2019d be surprised. I\u2019ve seen it many times.", "Dispatchers are trained to walk any lay person through appropriate interventions.", "It\u2019s not just about speed, it\u2019s about positioning in the vehicle, monitoring, interventions like rescue breathing and/or CPR and safety of a distressed solo driver.", "The better comparison is faster than an ambulance can arrive. As soon as the ambulance is there, EMTs/ paramedics can begin administering care, something that Grandma can't do while she's driving.", "Follow the instructions of the 911 dispatch to appropriately clear the airway and position the child", "OP updated saying they live 5 minutes from hospital so ambulance would be quicker", "Convertable there is a area in the back under the seat.  They are done that way so you  can use it to use on a plane too with a lap belt.\n\nEdit: here is a example. Also don't use seat belt and latch together. \n\n https://imgur.com/a/o1ST47c", "Bullshit. The average survival rate of CPR outside of a hospital is between 5 and 10%. You have not seen it many times.", "I'm aware, but most people still don't do it properly even when being walked through it. If a baby is choking, it's really easy to push the obstruction even further into their throat when trying to remove it. You also have to hit them on the back much harder than a lot of people are comfortable with, and the same goes for applying enough pressure for compressions.     \n\nThat being said, anyone who is going to be caring for an infant should take an infant/child CPR class just in case. Even though I'd been cor certified for 10 years, the first time I actually had to use it was terrifying even though I had 911 on the phone."]}
