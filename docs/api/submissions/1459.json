There is this guy in my friend group who we will refer to as UPTB (19 m) (this may make sense later) who is a freshman. To explain his personality, he has one of the highest egos I\u2019ve ever encountered and he is a want to be country boy. Basically I met him at orientation for my uni (I\u2019m a junior by credit hours) and I met other people then too. Basically he gave me weird vibes from the beginning and he kept flirting with me after orientation. \n\nWell about a month ago now, UPTB got shit faced at a party after judging my friend group for drinking a lot. he also says he \u201cdrinks for the taste\u201d. Anyway after this party he went to this other girls dorm and he kept asking her to fuck and he un-consensually put his hands in her pants. UPTB then proceeded to pass out in her dorm and she left to go stay in someone else\u2019s dorm because she felt uncomfortable. She then proceeded to get a text at like 3am from UPTB saying he needed to use the bathroom but her bathroom door was locked. She told him to go back to his dorm. He then texted her that he \u201cpissed on the floor\u201d and then he left to go back to his dorm. She then came back to her dorm and found her floor literally covered in piss and shit that had been smeared into the carpet. \n\nI immediately felt uncomfortable hearing this mostly because he harassed this girl but also because I think it\u2019s fucked up how he did that on her floor whether he was drunk or not. \n\nToday, UPTB sat with us in the cafe area where me and my friends talked about going to the library to work on our project for one of our classes. UPTB then proceeded to invite himself to \u201chang out\u201d with us when he isn\u2019t even in our classes and the whole point of our trip to the library was to work on research for this project. When we got to the library he would not shut up and kept bothering us with unrelated things while we were trying to work. My project partner was uncomfortable by UPTB and he doesn\u2019t even know what he has done. UPTB then mentioned how the friend group had been avoiding him and I tried to play it off but felt kind of bad. \n\nAfter the library I went to go hang out with my friends and he tried to invite himself again but I was able to give some dumb excuse to get him to go away. \n\nAITA for avoiding the un-potty trained boy?\n\nEdit: This is not just a rumor I saw the images and I am scarred", "created_utc": 1667622287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymk0st/aita_for_purposefully_avoiding_someone/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How about telling him to go away because you don\u2019t like him.", "Hello OP I read everything you wrote and please remember you are not a bad person. You are NTA. \n\nFrom what you wrote UPTB has massive red flags written all over him. I am glad your fellow uni mate did not spend the night in her dorm with him in case he did some harm. What he did to her carpet is just yuck \ud83e\udd22\n\nYou did nothing wrong avoiding him. Moving forward, if he keeps on being a pest I suggest you and the others should report this matter to the faculty head or the RA (residential advisor) and residential manager (RM) to put a stop to it. If nothing is done, do not give up and report to the university security and safety folks and the management in charge", "NTA\n\nIs there someone in charge at uni who you can report him to in regards to him pissing and pooping in your room?\n\nIn future, be frank and tell him to eff off."]}
