It doesn\u2019t pay great, but it\u2019s an upgrade from what my last job paid me, and I\u2019m getting more hours, so I\u2019m fine with that. The thing is, I told my girlfriend Hannah (20F) that I got a job doing something else more professional. I was embarrassed to admit the truth, and I also know how much she hates fast food places given her upbringing and her diet. Hannah was raised by parents that are pretty well off, to the point that she\u2019s going through college with no debt, no aid, and no issues, with all expenses covered by her parents including a monthly allowance so she doesn\u2019t need a job. To her, cheap fast food places are \u201cthe worst\u201d and what they serve \u201chardly deserve to be called food\u201d. She\u2019s also a vegan, so if I were to work in food service, she wouldn\u2019t be okay with me working in any restaurant that isn\u2019t at least vegetarian. I know I shouldn\u2019t lie, but job hunting has been hard and I haven\u2019t been left with much options other than to take a job as quick as I could or try and ask my parents for money, and I don\u2019t want them stretching themselves any thinner than they already do.\n\nThe problem came two days ago, though, when I was working the window during lunch rush. I went to hand out an order for a double cheeseburger, and when I turned my head, the girl in the car was Hannah. I was shocked. The moment she recognized me she got angry. She didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t even take her food, just sped off. I didn\u2019t know what to do except keep working. I tried to text her and call her on my break but she wouldn\u2019t answer. I ended up going by her apartment after work and her roommate let her in (I guess Hannah hadn\u2019t told her about what happened because Hannah was pissed about that too).\n\nHannah blew up at me for lying about my job and I apologized. I tried to explain that it was because I was ashamed and embarrassed but needed the money, but she wasn\u2019t having any of that. She told me she needed to think about if she still wanted to even be with me after his, which honestly broke my heart a little, because I love Hannah. I\u2019ve thought about marrying her already. I asked her if there was anything I could do to make it up to her and she told me I need to quit my job. She specifically said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place.\u201d Which made me think about WHY she was there. When I tried to ask, she got angry again and screamed that it\u2019s none of my business and that I wouldn\u2019t understand and \u201cmaybe if I finally went vegan like she\u2019s been begging me to\u201d that we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. She stormed into her room after that, so I took the hint and left. I don\u2019t know what to do now, but she\u2019s still not messaging me back and I\u2019m starting to think I messed up bad by lying.

If she's vegan, and hates fast food so much, why was she in the drive-thru??", "ESH. You for lying about your job, she for lying about being vegan and shittalking food that she eats in secret.", "Giant ESH\n\nYou shouldn't feel the need to be lying about your employment.\n\nGF sounds absolutely insufferable", "ESH. A relationship built on lies will never last. She's an asshole for being so judgmental, but you choosing to lie was a very poor decision and it would have come to light eventually. You're still really young, find a girl that you don't need to hide things from in order to keep.", "ESH. It looks like you both lie though, so maybe there\u2019s hope for a reconciliation. You know she was there to eat a burger, right? She\u2019s mad she\u2019s been found out. But if you\u2019d been honest, she could\u2019ve gone to a different store.", "ESH - You're lying to her and she's mad for all the wrong reasons.", "This is bananas. \n\nESH. Why would you even want to be with someone like this? Stop trying to impress terrible women by lying to them. Everything about your situation was destined to end in disaster. She's judgemental and shitty, you're insecure and lie to her. \n\nThere's nothing shameful about working fast food. Work is work. I know an engineer with a masters degree who worked retail for a while after he was laid off, because you know, money. Nothing wrong with that.", "Shouldn't have lied but this girlfriend sounds outrageously awful", "Esh you\u2019re both liars.", "ESH.  You shouldn't have lied, that was bound to blow up in your face eventually.  And you don't want to have any amount of distrust in your relationship.\n\nBut your gf sounds obnoxious as hell.  She also sounds super controlling.  I would just let her go, this relationship would have been doomed anyway.", "ESH. But this is where lying gets you in trouble. You lie about one thing and now your partner is wondering what else did you lie about? Can they trust what you tell them?", "NTA\n\nThe one burning question I have:  ***WHY was your \"vegetarian\" gf buying a double cheeseburger??????***\n\nShe obviously doesn't understand that not everyone comes from a financially comfortable background.  In your case, you took the job that was offered so you wern't a burden to your parents.\n\nYou didn't tell her the truth because you were afraid of what she would think of you or say, given her past comments.\n\nIt's time to let this relationship go.   It's not going to work.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "ESH.\n\nIn a way, I get it...  when I was in college, I had a girlfriend from a very well to do family, and they absolutely did not approve of her being with dirt-poor me from farm country.  I get there being pressure to want to fit in, appear to be closer to them in terms of job and whatever.  Lying isn't the way to do that.  You are (or at least were) planning to marry this person - don't hide shit about who you are and what you do for a living.  Because for real, that makes it hard for the other person to trust you.\n\nAnd as an aside, don't ever be ashamed of doing an honest days work.\n\nOn the other hand, her reaction is ridiculous.  It's understandable being upset that you lied.  But giving you grief for working there, demanding that you quit, telling you the situation is all your fault for not being vegan - when she was there for a cheeseburger?  Gimme a break.\n\nHonestly dude, before you go much further in this relationship, I'd have a sit-down with this girl and find a way to explain to her - gently - that for those of us who actually pay our own bills and don't get an allowance from mom and dad, sometimes that means taking a job that isn't exactly what we'd like to be doing.  Demanding that you quit your job because she doesn't like what they sell - even when she is apparently a willing customer - is some straight up bullshit.", "ESH.  You trafficked in falsehoods and she's a hypocrite.  I think you should contemplate a post-Hannah life.", "ESH. You can't lie like this in a relationship and she just sounds like an awful human being.", "You should have never lied.  If someone doesn't respect and accept you for who you are, they are NOT your person.  She shouldn't have lied either - being she was there for a fast food cheeseburger - vegan my a$$.  Do NOT quit your job for anyone but yourself!  Good luck! ESH", "NTA but why would you want to marry someone who\u2019d judge you for where you work?", "ESH. You're old enough to be honest about where you work, and there is nothing shameful in working at a fast food joint. She's just mad she got busted buying the very same food she disparages.", "I re read this realizing i interpreted some things wrong.  Both of you are AH and are not meant for each other right now.  She can't be honest about being a Vegan.  You can't be honest about where you work.  Why are the two of you even together?  The entire relationship started on lies.", "Bro if her love for you is conditional (as in only if you don't work at XYZ place) then she doesn't really love you. You are better off away from that type of toxic relationship. NTA and I hope you find someone who loves you no matter where you work.", "ESH. Only because your gF sounds insufferable and I don\u2019t blame you for lieing.. you should rethink the whole relationship. And don\u2019t let her pressure you into quitting a job or becoming a vegan. Ever", "She sounds like an immature brat living on Daddys money.\n\nNTA. Dump that broad.", "ESH\n\nYou really fucked up bad by lying although I get how someone could be embarrassed. And when I say fucked up I mean nuclear as you ruined any trust she has for you and likely the relationship. She is also a complete hypocrite for having a problem with people working at a fast food place but also being ok with spending money there.\n\nHonestly I suspect her real issue is that she just wants to date someone with a professional job or someone from money like her. Maybe wants someone who at least pretends to be vegan like she pretends. The whole vegan thing is bs if she is still willing to buy fast food but she probably feels guilty about it. She got more pissed and claimed \"you wouldn't understand\" because she realized she was caught and doesn't want to admit it.\n\nBy the way the \"situation\" here is her just being annoyed someone found out she wasn't as vegan as she wants others to think, lol. Sort of like how a guy caught going to the strip club might say there wouldn't have been a \"situation\" if his girlfriend didn't lie about working at the club.", "LMAO. This is awesome. Y'all caught each other up. She's lied just like you did only she won't fess up to it. Is this really something you want? There is nothing wrong with working at fast food when you're making an honest living. There is something wrong with having to hide it because you're ashamed and it's not good enough for her or her family. Drop her dude she's gonna cause you a lot of headaches and heartaches if you have to make sure you're up to her standards.", "Honestly, I'm gonna go NTA with a mild ESH, and lemme explain.\n\nYou're *a bit* of an AH for lying to your girlfriend. Lying in a relationship is nothing but a bad thing.\n\n**HOWEVER**.\n\n>To her, cheap fast food places are \u201cthe worst\u201d and what they serve \u201chardly deserve to be called food\u201d.\n\n>to hand out an order for a double cheeseburger, and when I turned my head, the girl in the car was Hannah\n\nShe is very plainly and obviously lying to you - either about being vegan, or about the burger being for her. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n>The moment she recognized me she got angry. She didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t even take her food, just sped off.\n\nThis is a kneejerk reaction to being caught in a lie. Deer in headlights. The only way for her to get out of the situation without giving you a chance to ask questions was to speed off like she did.\n\n>I didn\u2019t know what to do except keep working. I tried to text her and call her on my break but she wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\nCold shoulder. \ud83d\udea9\n\n>I tried to explain that it was because I was ashamed and embarrassed but needed the money\n\nThe fact that she didn't stop and rethink herself at this exact moment is a MASSIVE \ud83d\udea9.\n\n>She told me she needed to think about if she still wanted to even be with me after his, which honestly broke my heart a little, because I love Hannah.\n\nTextbook emotional manipulation. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n>I asked her if there was anything I could do to make it up to her and she told me I need to quit my job.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n>Which made me think about WHY she was there.

Hannah is manipulating you, gaslighting you, and trying to control you to the point of dictating what you do for work and where you live.\n\nI feel the need to stress the following: **IT IS *NOT* YOUR FAULT**. I've been in a relationship with someone that bears startling similarities to Hannah. When you're treated the way you're being treated, seeing through the smoke and mirrors that your partner puts up is *extremely* hard. You are no less of a person, in any facet, for thinking the way you're thinking right now.\n\nDump Hannah. Stay at your job until you find one that **YOU** would prefer to have. If you can/want to reach out to your parents about what's going on, I would do so.\n\n>Was I the asshole here?\n\nOverall, **NTA**.\n\nYou're not an asshole, you're a victim of abuse and manipulation. And as someone who's been in that position, I am so, so sorry for what you're going through.", "Geez dude, this has a share of blame for everyone. Yes, you should not have lied. Not because you owe it to anyone, but because you don't have the luxury of choosing a job that matches your ethics (whether this job does or not is immaterial). You needed work in order to pay your bills, and nobody should ever shame you for doing honest work to achieve that.\n\nSecond, she's also TA, because she shouldn't be judging your work based on her economic situation, but on yours. If she can't understand that you are not in the same financial situation as her, then she's got some growing up to do, because she is going to meet a lot of people in different situations (both more- and less-advantaged), and acting like everyone should live like her is going to lose her friends. Being in a relationship is about reaching compromises with your SO, which brings me to my third point:\n\nShe's a manipulator who is only going to be satisfied with your choices when they match hers. This is evidenced by her reaction saying \"if you'd only done what I said, we wouldn't have this problem\", as if you were wrong solely because you did something she disagreed with. That's not a person willing to compromise for your relationship, it's someone who will demand that you do all of the compromising. Be happy with that if you like it, but personally, I'd be pissed as hell after hearing something like that.", "Uhhhhhhhhhhhh, so she's NOT a vegan but I'm willing to bet that she uses her fake veganism as a HUGE part of her identity to other people. Then she got caught by you buying a double cheeseburger, which screws up all of her identity. She's acting like a 5 year old because she got caught.\n\nNTA and dude, please do not try to continue to date her.", "NTA. She's pissed she was lying about being vegan and got caught.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t think you were intentionally trying to hurt her. You shouldn\u2019t have lied, but she was also lying so\u2026\n\nI\u2019m going to say this and I hope you read it: if you were embarrassed enough to not tell the person you want to marry what you do for a living, why do you want to be with that person? What do you think she would do if, in 20 years, you lost your job and had to work nights at Taco Bell to make ends meat for her and your children? How do you think she would react if you did *anything* that doesn\u2019t fit into her perfect world view? Would she get upset if you paid for your groceries with coupons? What would happen if you had children and one of them had a disability? Would that fit into her perfect world view? Why is she hiding something as simple as her diet from you? Does she also lie about other menial things? Why is she so insecure and so judgmental that her eating a fast food burger needs to be such an enormous secret? For someone to keep something so insignificant a secret, she is either severely traumatized or incredibly hypocritical. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna tell you what to do, but I am gonna tell you one piece of advice I wish I would have known when I was your age: \n\nThe people who love you will never be ashamed of you. If my husband worked at McDonald\u2019s in order to make ends meat for our family, I would tell the world how lucky I am to have someone in my life who works hard for his family.", "If a person breaks down lines of communication for any reason, the relationship is over.\n\nShe is threatening to break up with you because of a weird lie and you not being vegan?\n\nNo. She's punishing you for catching her being hypocritical. Even if the burger wasn't hers, if she'd be mad at you for working at a nonvegan place, she's hypocritical for ordering and picking up non vegan food.\n\nFace it dude. This relationship is over.", "Nta.\n\nInfo: in your fast food have you some vegan alternatives? Because why She was there can be related only to two things, vegan food or LIES.\n\nA job Is a job, and you have to be proud to work, even if you don't like the job. If She don't understand the importance of have a job, for Money and for the mind, well...forget about the ring dude.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is the asshole, an elitist and has no grip on reality.  You sound like a nice person who deserves better.", "NTA. Lying was bad, but the result would have been the same argument. I applaud you for taking a shit job when you needed it instead of asking your folks. Often on this thread there's  guys who stay unemployed because they're too good for that job. Redditers say go get any job while you keep looking. Gf is wrong and a hypocrite. Ditch her", "NTA. She's embarrassed that her hypocrisy was exposed. I worked in fast food before, I don't think you could have kept the smell of burgers off you long term, anyway. Especially when she's craving them.", "ESH but very soft on your part: You shouldn't be lying about something so important about your job and you shouldn't be embarrassed. You're working and paying bills and it's better than being a bum and leeching off of everyone else. She got caught in a lie and she's angry and lashing out. You're so young. My advice is to break up with her. You'll find someone else who truly appreciates you and won't judge you for having an honest job and being a hard worker.", "ESH\n\nYeah like, don't lie to your gf.\n\nBut also she has no business telling you where you can and can't work and pressuring you to become vegan and holding your relationship over your head.", "NTA but HANNAH sounds demeaning, judge mental, hypocritical, non compassionate , spoiled.  You can\u2019t even tell her a basic thing about yourself  like where you work ? So The communication sucks too . You\u2019re work ethic is to be commended .  She should be proud of your efforts.  So what are you marrying her for ?", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have lied, but she\u2019s awful. This is not a match made in Heaven. You\u2019re too good for her, frankly.", "NTA. I think Hannah is more upset she got caught getting a double cheeseburger. She's being ridiculous. I would stop messaging and chasing her. Let her come back around. Even then I would think twice about being with someone who shamed me for my job.", "NTA. It was not right to lie; you know this. But you felt a lot of pressure to lie in order to keep her from getting angry over the place you're employed at. That's the part you should focus on, because that's not a healthy relationship dynamic. First and foremost, you need to take care of your basic needs. When there aren't many jobs available, you take what you can get in order to support yourself. If she wants you to quit your job, it's your ability to be self-sufficient that will take the hit. Quit the relationship instead.", "NTA. You shouldn't have lied, but if your GF was reasonable you wouldn't have had to lie. That said, if your girlfriend doesn't want to pay your bills then she gets no say in where you work to make that money. Employment is honorable. It doesn't matter what you're doing.", "NTA, I think your girlfriend was a little entitled telling you to quit your job. it\u2019s not like you were selling drugs.", "Slight YTA. You should have been honest even if it hurt. But you need a job. It was what you could get. Ok not ideal but it\u2019s honest work. Hannah sounds a bit entitled with her borderline wealthy upbringing and having $ and not having to work. Keep trying if you really care for her. Under the circumstances most people could see why you lied. You were embarrassed. Also, a red flag.. why was your vegan GF at a horrible fast food restaurant that she hates ordering a cheeseburger???? Sounds like you weren\u2019t the only dishonest 1 in this relationship.

She sounds controlling. You\u2019re quite young and you will find love again. I think it might be worth considering breaking up with her.", "NTA.\n\nWhy are you with this person? She has zero respect for you. Having a particular diet is nice and all, but she's coming at you from a place of blatant privilege and showing no consideration for your life circumstances.\n\nBreak up with her if you haven't already, you're young and will have loads of opportunities to meet better quality individuals.\n\nEdit: All of you voting ESH because a 21 year old withheld where he works from his toxic, holier-than-though, snobby girlfriend are outside of your minds.", "NTA I couldn't be with someone as shallow and judgmental as your GF. Just lose her number, you'll be better off", "NTA dude.\nShe's more angry that you know her secret...she's fronting at being a vegan and if you keep working there she's gonna have to find snother burger place! Lol\nShe's a snob, cut her loose", "Her lie was much bigger than yours. She also sounds very needy and controlling. NTA and don\u2019t apologise to her anymore. And don\u2019t quit your job until you\u2019re in a position to do so. She doesn\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA. You shouldn't have lied but I don't think it makes you an A H for being embarrassed given her views. She's only acting so angry to cover her embarrassment at being caught about to sink her teeth into a double cheeseburger. Vegan my butt.", "Keep your job, lose the girl.", "NTA...sending love. \u2764\ufe0f", "There should be a judgement for when someone else in the story is clearly the AH.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds snobby  it does,'t matter if she doesn't like fast food, but don't judge others for liking it. She should be happy for you that you got a job.\n\nShe also lied about being vegan and hating fast food. \n\nI get why you lied to her. You just didn't want to be judged.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA my friend. You may have to rethink your relationship with her if she gets angry with you working in a fast-food restaurant. \n\nThere is no problem with working in such a place, it's honest work that's putting food on the table and pays the bills.", "Yeah, the fact that she was lying about being vegan, and then blaming OP for it makes you wonder what other manipulative lies she was telling.", ">shouldn't feel the need\n\nSo he's lying because he feels like it would harm his relationship. Which gives him (in my opinion) a valid reason. How does he suck for that? He's hasn't harmed her in any way. If this were genderbent, everyone would be saying NTA RED FLAG ABUSE. \n\nJust because you feel like he brought it on himself for lying about something he didn't need to doesn't mean he's an asshole for it.", "Oh also - big NTA.", "She\u2019s only mad because you caught her. If she had known where you worked she would have gone to a fast food place you didn\u2019t work at and kept lying to you about her being vegan!", "Whatever you do don\u2019t marry someone that will make you feel less than just because of your job\u2026 a job is job my dude everyone has to start somewhere. Ofc except from Hannah since she knows no hard work and relies on handouts from her parents", "Working in fast food is respectable. You earn money, you pay for yourself and you are clearly trying to make sure your parents don't have to stretch themselves in their finances to support you. That is respectable.  It may not be a job you want forever, but being able to put food on your table and a roof over your head by working hard is respectable no matter where you work. Don't base your own life on the values of others. (Tbh this does not sound like a healthy or equal relationship, think twice before you ask for marriage. You deserve respect too) \nNTA.", "He is being an AH to himself by being with someone who is either so dense or unempathetic that they would judge him for working to support himself at a pretty normal job.", "Liars are always the AH. It\u2019s hypocritical to be mad at the girlfriend for lying when he\u2019s a liar too. Liars almost never lie about just one thing.", "He still lied to her and that's not okay.", "This.", "If this was a woman posting this about her boyfriend, nobody would be denying she's in an abusive controlling relationship and is in no way an asshole", "Aw and she's sayin', sayin' that she wants only beans, and I wonder why she fucks with bacon!", "She sucks worse, though, by a *significant* margin.  Like so much I'm wondering if this even real.", "Seriously, this is not ESH, this sub sometimes is just like, \"beep boop, you also did a bad\" when someone was *totally* driven to it.", "pescatarians don't eat meat but eat fish", "Some people genuinely believe it's OK to eat fish because they supposedly can't feel pain, it's weird.", "My own personal judgements aside, I was surprised that comment had so many upvotes. I thought redditors were \u201cred flag\u201d crazy. \n\nUsually when someone has lied about something that *is perfectly normal and acceptable* because their partner/parent/whoever, has made it clear they majorly disapprove of it and cannot respect anyone involved in it, we usually support the \u201cliar\u201d.\n\nThis time it\u2019s like \u201clisten asshole, you should learn to accept their crazy controlling behaviour or move on, it\u2019s your own fault if you feel trapped emotionally by them being unreasonable (and apparently\u2026) hypocrites\u201d", "anyone here denying that op is in an abusive relationship?", "Well she was probably sheltered her whole life so of course she sucks much more since she is likely out of touch with many things.  \n\n\nI knew few rich girls that were sheltered and they always live in their own reality that makes sense to them but not much to anyone else.", "She's in deep denial to herself. \n\nNTA but a woman who feels entitled to pressure you into veganism, is a snob towards certain jobs despite never having worked before, and has zero understanding of the realities of the current economy?\n\nCut your losses and run before you impregnate her.", "Cheese is vegetarian (afaik), but not vegan. There is vegan 'cheese' made from nuts and what all, but I doubt a cheeseburger would have that kind of cheese. Apart from the 'burger' part ....\n\n>Wait, cheeseburgers aren't vegan?", "Why do you care why or why  not someone is eating x? To distinguish fish from mammals is a very valid biological distinction.", "Are you just going through my post history or something? \n\nYes, they are. You don't call someone an asshole for being in an abusive relationship.", "Why do you assume I care what someone does or doesn't eat as long as it's legal? \n\nIf you're going to be a hypocrite and say you're vegan to be cruelty free, and then lie and claim fish can't feel pain so it's OK, you're a hypocrite. I couldn't care less what you choose to eat and not eat, I just don't like hypocrites.", "This exactly!! Op is being at the very LEAST emotionally abused. Who is terrified of telling their partner they got a job? People who are scared of the reaction of their partner and you don\u2019t get scared of your partner being in a healthy relationship. No he shouldn\u2019t of lied but he shouldn\u2019t have felt the need to lie to protect himself. If the genders were reversed and she got a job at some minimum wage store and he freaked out saying she shouldn\u2019t be working in a dump like that and blah blah blah. This is 100% a toxic and abusive relationship that op needs to get out of and her trying to force and manipulate him into being vegan is fucking insane. And she\u2019s also pretty fucking stupid because I went vegan for a bit I fucking worked at fast casual burger and fries place. It didn\u2019t change what I ate like Jesus Christ.", "By the time I got to the end it was confusing because he was wording it like he was still unemployed so I forgot about the earlier half"]}
