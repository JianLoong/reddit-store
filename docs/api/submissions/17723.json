In addition to the teachable moment of \"women's issues\", this is a good time to delve into your boys' psyche regarding sharing a hot tub. Do they also refuse to swim with her in a pool? Maybe do a family session, where you all go into the tub as a family? I also need to add that the Mayo clinic suggests children over age 5 not spend more than 20 minutes at a time, and that spending too much time in hot water may impair sperm function. I'm also going to give suggestions you may have already explored: hot water bottles; acupuncture; go to other gynecologists specializing in endometriosis (preferably women).", "NTA.

Of the very few things that work with ANY consistency is heat. I'd recommend if she's tired of the tub to look into trying a TENS machine, portable heating pads, weighted heating pads etc to give her more freedom while you duke it out with the doctors. As for the boys, she's willing to share and the tub is a family appliance. You're right, it's a them problem that they think its weird and your wife should be more supportive. There is no tough it out with endo if youre symptomatic. That's the bullshit women have been told since long before it was discovered and named and its terrible advice.

Aside from the stigma of teens on the pill, endo is exacerbated by the natural spikes in estrogen associated the menstrual cycle. That's why it doesn't crop up until puberty. Taking a progesterone only pill and skipping the placebos stops periods and therefore the natural estrogen spikes which exacerbates and worsens the disease.

Don't go to someone who ONLY does endo though, they often don't take insurance at all for services.

If you plot period pain across the population, you see a spectrum from always painless to always in severe pain. So spectra of both pain level and time spent in pain. \n\nToo many who have steadier and lighter or less frequent pain take their own personal experiences and assume everyone else is like them and that their level and frequency of pain is standard. So basically, the way they think is that pain is on or off for everyone, and all period pain is maximum at their level of pain and their time spent in pain. \n\nIf we practice knowing in the front of our minds that most things are not binary but spectra, we can more easily set up systems that cater to a greater number of people and more easily practice empathy to those who happen to fall into more challenging edges of the spectra.", "It's still weird to me, because in popular culture (in the US), it's a known thing. I had mostly pain free periods, like no bloating or cramps, but in health class, menstrual health literature, TV and movies, it's explained.", "I still get twinges here and there. But not having to call out monthly or being in crippling pain regularly is a godsend.", "Yep! I only do the prescribed nexium/nsaid therapy 10 days out of the month. And honestly have made a ton of dietary changes so as not to require more PPIs then necessary", "Hmmm, my doc has me only taking nexium when I have to do NSAID therapy (10 days out of the month). I take the nexium before eating, eat and then take the NSAIDs, as directed. Severe gastritis runs in my family and this prescriptive is meant as a prophylactic, I do not get heartburn. The amount of NSAIDs they prescribe is off-label (and a bit scary) and is meant to inhibit prostaglandins (which endometriosis is correlated to high levels of). \nI\u2019m not really sure the celery is for me, but thanks anyway.", "Of course but it stops spreading the desease, I mean it should be tried at least. Yes doctors prescribe it like candy for contraception when there is so much side effects, but here it seems at least temporary a solution.", "Yes, everyone is different... I'm sorry you are going through hysterectomy. \nI myself have strong pains (but no malformation just no luck) years crying, vomiting, not being heard by doctors because why bother... I have very strong medecine just to go through the wort days. I might try to burn the endometre as a solution (stop periods and fertility but keep hormonal transmission)", "I have recently been diagnosed with endo, and while yes, there is a constant level of pain, the pain during periods is so much worse because all those little minute places that have uterine cells attached to them also try to shed their lining. So essentially you\u2019re having period cramps throughout your entire abdomen and wherever else they\u2019ve adhered. It\u2019s not necessarily the bleeding itself that causes the pain, but the cramping that goes along with it.", "He could have kept it.  As father, he would have to agree to the adoption.  He could easily have exercised his parental rights and raised the baby.  He wanted to have the kid, and have it raised by someone else, who was 13 yo.", "Yes it does. Read any of the child development stats. I am giving anecdotes, but my discussion of the majority of boys of that age is based on common developmental stats. 10-13 yo is a common time to be masturbating and being interested in sexuality. You appear to be basing your info off anecdotes and not science.", "It started when I was 6 at the hands of my older brothers.  Every woman I\u2019ve had the privilege to know well has a story.", "oh i get what you mean now ty!!", "I\u2019m sorry what do you mean?", "I'm on progesterone pill and have been for a few years and meanwhile my endometriosis is getting worse. I'm in daily pain, during my periods I vomit it's so bad. \n\nSo it's great that the progesterone pill has significantly reduced your symptoms, for others it doesn't help.", "Yeah, the only reason I got approved at that age, being childless, is because an ablation (the burning of the uterine lining) was physically impossible. Same for IUD, which is how the deformity was discovered in the first place.\n\nLuckily, I never wanted kids, so don\u2019t feel too sorry for me, I\u2019m kind of happy I\u2019ll have to worry about being pregnant and not having a choice in the matter. Also because giving birth naturally would likely kill me, if I was even able to get that far. I can get pregnant, but anything beyond that, was a \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know, but do NOT try to give birth naturally, ever.\u201d", "Sorry to hear that, of course that's purely anecdotal and proves nothing", "No worries, sometimes I don\u2019t understand something and just need clarification but people can be nasty about it.", "Once again, no, there are statistics for these things that say otherwise. Anecdotes are part of those statistics.", "theres also a lot of meanings tied to the word spectrum so it got me for a moment but we\u2019re all good \u263a\ufe0f"]}
