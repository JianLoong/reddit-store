In addition to the teachable moment of \"women's issues\", this is a good time to delve into your boys' psyche regarding sharing a hot tub. Do they also refuse to swim with her in a pool? Maybe do a family session, where you all go into the tub as a family? I also need to add that the Mayo clinic suggests children over age 5 not spend more than 20 minutes at a time, and that spending too much time in hot water may impair sperm function. I'm also going to give suggestions you may have already explored: hot water bottles; acupuncture; go to other gynecologists specializing in endometriosis (preferably women).", "NTA.

Of the very few things that work with ANY consistency is heat. I'd recommend if she's tired of the tub to look into trying a TENS machine, portable heating pads, weighted heating pads etc to give her more freedom while you duke it out with the doctors. As for the boys, she's willing to share and the tub is a family appliance. You're right, it's a them problem that they think its weird and your wife should be more supportive. There is no tough it out with endo if youre symptomatic. That's the bullshit women have been told since long before it was discovered and named and its terrible advice.

Don't go to someone who ONLY does endo though, they often don't take insurance at all for services.
