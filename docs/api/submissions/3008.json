You said it perfectly.  Your money is not his privilege.  You are not his mother.", "Nta you can't afford what you can't afford and you're already covering the major bills.", "NTA; you're right, he's not entitled to your money, and when things are tight, necessities have to come first. Now, a cellphone could be considered a necessity in this day and age, but a gym membership certainly is not. Regardless, the basics like rent and food and your bills have to come first. If the money doesn't stretch further than that, too bad.", "NTA.  He needs to A.  Ride the asses of the insurance company till he gets his money, B. Find work he can do, and C. Reimburse you for what you've paid in his behalf.", "Why does he need the gym membership if his knee is bad?", "NTA", "NTA. He wants you to pay all his bills and take care of him.", "NTA for not paying these things, anyway.\n\nBut please be sure that without his phone paid he still has a *reliable* way to be contacted for employment purposes.  If he *needs* it to find or keep employment, it'd be counterproductive to have him without that just to make some point about him not having any money.  He may need to see if he can switch to a cheaper plan or something, but I know that's easier said than done if you're on a contract.  And there may be viable options for him other than you paying this bill, it's just something to keep in mind.\n\nHe can certainly do without the gym membership, though.  It sounds like it's for things other than something like rehab for his knee.\n\nPlease don't hassle him so much about the insurance thing, though.  That is not actually *his* fault.  He's calling every week and it's not like he can force them to deal with it.  He's not failing to cast some special magic spell which will immediately make it happen.\n\nDefinitely do not budge on the gym membership and other true non-necessities, though.  That's an entirely optional expense and it's the first kind of thing that needs to give in a situation like this.  This is an obvious place for him to cut back, and in absolutely no way is it appropriate to blame you for it.", "Probably NTA \n\nWhile he is not entitled to your money, I don't think you understand that his insurance pay taking months is actually normal. There are a lot of hoops to jump through and paper work that needs to be done, some of it totally out of his control. Having a lawyer probably will not change how things go with the insurance company, it's a brutally slow process regardless.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d say your responsibility to the relationship (if you can manage) is simply to keep him fed and sheltered. People will argue that isn\u2019t even your responsibility, but honestly, you guys are a cohabitating team so I feel there\u2019s a mutual obligation to one another to the extent possible. It ends there though. He can cancel the gym and work out at home or in the park. It goes without saying that he shouldn\u2019t have any gaming or entertainment subscriptions, etc. going at this time.\n\nCell phone is a bit of a gray area and depends how important it is for you guys to stay connected. At this point in society, a cell phone isn\u2019t a luxury it is a necessity. Especially if he\u2019s looking for a job. So in my humble opinion, helping him keep a phone going (even if that means switching to a simple pay as you go plan) might come right after shelter and food.", "NTA, you're entirely right\n\nMaybe hes a great person but just based on this, sounds like you deserve a better partner. This one isn't very respectful to you", "NTA. Feeling entitled to your money. He needs to put in the work and actually fight this. It's almost like he's choosing to be complacent in the exterior because it's a lot of work, but it's not a lot of work for him to try and financially depend on you.\n\nDon't back down on this", "He's training the other bodyparts until his knee gets better. It's really hard to describe in english what exactly is wrong with his knee, but it will get better in time", "He can still be reached by E-Mail, because I'm paying for the Wifi, too and he's on his PC all day anyway. I'm fully aware od the situation and am trying to deal with it as best as I can. I know it's not actually his fault that they didn't pay yet, but he could have gotten legal assistance months ago when all of this started (or even now, but he still hasn't done that) and I'm convinced this would have never gotten that far. That's why I'm getting more and more impatient.", "Where we are from, it is absolutely unusual to take this long. Up to two weeks delay for the first transaction is normal and absolutely okay, eberything else is outrageous.", "Even though he should've been responsible early on to getting this issue fixed, it's too late for that. You both need to move on from that and focus on getting that insurance assistance now. \nIf he's just waiting on an email, he may think he can just be on his PC because there's nothing else he can do. \nYou two should talk and compromise on what finances are important or not. And I'm assuming you feel like he's being lazy (because you said he's on his PC all day) because he's not doing housechores or anything to help make your burdens easier.\nJust let him know you feel like you're carrying this burden alone when it's the insurance fault. He should help you out too.\nYou're definitely NTA but you can't leave him in the unknown. If he's worth it, talk to him! Good luck", "Probably the US.  Like with everything else, they jerk us around over these kinds of things.  My ex went through years trying to get proper payment from an injury.", "Has he been doing what he is supposed to (getting them the necessary paperwork and such)? If he is calling every week and has done what they ask, I'm really not sure what more you expect him to do? \n\nDoes it suck? Absolutely. But if he's doing what he's supposed to on his end, it's not his fault. Now, that doesn't mean he is entitled to your money. He is not. \n\nThat said - you guys live together. It could just as easily be you that is out of work due to medical issue. How would you want him to handle things if roles were reversed? Would you want him to pay your phone bill, if he could? Essentials absolutely should come first. But after that, I think a discussion is warranted on how to get through this. It's not as if he quit his job for no reason. Is he still contributing in ways that he can such as doing housework, cooking, etc?", "He still does his household chores and I do mine, but apart from that he literally sits on the PC all day \ud83d\ude05\nIt's really just that I'm not used to this whole situation and I felt his behaviour out of line by asking me for money when he doesn't know if and when he can pay it back.", "I already stated at the vwry top of my post that we're not from the US ;)", "Yeah but what else is he supposed to do then? Do you want him to go beg on the streets? Lol\nYou guys have been dating for 2 years so he's confiding in his partner for help. I don't think it's a sinful thing to have asked you for money but since he's asking for money for the gym membership that's a silly thing to ask for and I totally understand your feelings for that. \n\nI kinda think for the cell phone bill was fair game but it shouldn't be bad since you pay for WiFi.\nHe might just feel like you don't have his back since the phone bill so you should reassure him that you do care for him but you can't afford certain bills. \nIt's just a tough situation so you're both on edge.", "I know, but I think the other person may have forgotten that it's not the same everywhere.", "Oh god I'm sorry, I didn't pay attention to the usernames \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No worries, I make those kinds of mistakes all the time. No harm done.", "NTA and you seem like your not happy with him.  Maybe it's time to part ways.", "NTA... you are supporting him. Put a time limit on this in your mind. He may need to find different work, that he can do with an injury. Have reasonable expectations - this is where you learn about who he is.", "nta", "Nta. For one if he is injured how is he worked our? Second if he isnt making any money then he needs to understand that he will have to make sacrifices. He cant expect you to work and pay all the joint bills your bills and his. Thats ridiculous and honestly i 2ould take a long hard look at you relationship as it sounds like hes taking advantage", "I completely agree with this! OP You Are NTA!!\n\nYou are already doing everything you absolutely can. He is not entitled to your money. He is not entitled to ruining your credit by having you spend money you do not have. He is not a child, and you are definitely not his mother.\n\nQuestions? Are there lawyers or other people who could help him get his insurance money faster for a small percentage? And is there any other kind of work he could do that doesn't require him to stress his damaged knee? If so why is he not applying for it?", "Agreed!!", "In that case I suggest he researched exercises he can do from home to keep the rest of the body strong and fit while reducing stress to the bad knee. There are plenty of videos to be found that can teach these things.", "NTA. I think you can do way better than this moocher", "NTA If he feels that you should be sharing finances then he needs to be cutting back while his income is on hold. The cell phone might be reasonable but if money is that tight things like gym memberships need to be put on hold."]}
