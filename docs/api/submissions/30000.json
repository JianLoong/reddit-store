Our 21 year old, Gabriella, is from my husband's first wife. \n\nMy 14 year old, Lucy, is extremely bright. We own a restaurant and she works for us on weekends for some spending money and Lucy remembers everyone's exact orders without writing anything down. She's incredible with anything involving numbers and loves math and science. Last year, we walked in on her doing Gabriella's pre nursing anatomy and chemistry homework. When we asked her why she was doing it, she said she saw it and thought it would be fun. She tutored Gabriella in a class she wasn't even taking.\n\nLast year, one of our regulars was talking to Lucy while we were slow. He was telling her how he works for a private school a few blocks from the restaurant and how he thinks Lucy should apply. He showed her picture the science labs and she fell in love with the school. That night she was begging us to apply. My husband and I already knew about the school, we've looked at it for her before. It's one of the best in the state but it's nearly $60k a year. It's extremely competitive (approximately 10% acceptance rate) so we decided to let her apply because chances were that she wouldn't get in. \n\nWe applied, she took the test and interview, took a private tour, and even shadowed for a day. We made sure she knew chances of her getting in were slim to none. She was accepted with a great financial aid package (15k tuition, all fees covered) but we still can't afford to shell out 60k just for high school so we told her she wasn't accepted. She was devastated for a week then she started to get over it. We did manage to get her transferred to a better public school.\n\nI don't know how but she recently found out that she actually did get into the school and she has been furious ever since. She's yelled at us too many times to count, cried for days, and is now upset that we wouldn't use the college fund my parents set up (45k) to help cover the cost. When I said she can't touch it until college, she started saying she could've used her inheritance from my husbands parents (approximately 400k) to get in. I again said no, it should be used for a better purpose, like buying her first house. There's also the issue that I can't give her younger siblings the same education if she goes there and that'll cause problems with them.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to us for over a week so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1698696146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k27sz/aita_for_lying_to_my_daughter_and_not_letting_her/", "score": 1638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were an even gianter asshole for lying to her about it.  Every feeling she has about you right now is completely justified even though your ultimate decision was probably the right one.  You'll be lucky if this child ever trusts you again.  YTA bigtime and I don't know how you could possibly hope to make this up to her.  Perhaps a meeting with the school to see if there is additional tuition assistance?  My daughter was at a private high school when her mother and I got divorced.  I went to the school and met with the admissions dean and they cut the tuition in half after a two minute meeting.  Did you even try?", "OP you really blew the mark on this one.  With proper financial investments, that $400k could have increased a lot, if it hasn't already.  On top of that, for a financial aid package to only be $15k to include everything when tuition alone was $60k?  She could have easily covered her college tuition through other financial aid packages if she was this young to get her tuition covered at nearly 75%.  You were solely putting your pride and your other children's needs ahead of hers, stunting her gifted abilities because of your insecurities.  Honestly, you said yourself that she was doing college work as a freshman high school student.  It's not your decision she purchase a house with that money.  It's your responsibility she gets the best possible chance at life, and to miss out on an educational responsibility like this is completely selfish and irresponsible of you for refusing to being afraid.  If her younger siblings are that smart then find a way to make it work, but more than likely they probably aren't so they'll either get over it or not.  Either way at least she'll never forgive you if she loses this opportunity because you put yourself first.  Why your parents put her first and not you.", "YTA so the child has $445K in college funds and inheritance. Instead of allowing her to go to private school which will 100% look better on applications, provide a better foundation for college, & likely open up huge opportunities for scholarships in the future, you decided to stunt her growth and derail her education. WTF is wrong with you??", "YTA. First for lying, and second for not letting her go. I understand this is a lot of money, but it sounds like she has money she could use. 60k out of 400k is not going to mean she can\u2019t buy a house someday. What it WILL mean is potentially being accepted to a better college, being given better collegiate scholarships, and a higher earning potential based on that college. \n\nAs far as the other kids go, it\u2019s time to explain that not everyone gets the same things, not everyone wants the same things, and that sometimes we do what is best for an individual even if it\u2019s not the same as what is best for someone else. \n\nBut mostly YTA for lying to your kid. She sounds exceptional, and you let her believe she wasn\u2019t. \n\nTruly though, I think you\u2019re being short sighted about the finances. Talk to the school about their collegiate pipeline and the earning potential for students who attend ivys over non ivys. It\u2019s astounding when you see the data. Your kid would be set for life. She\u2019d at least be almost guaranteed some huge academic scholarships, which would help offset the cost of the high school.", "YTA. \n\nLiterally every decision you made along this situation made you a TA. \n\nIf she's that bright, she'll probably get scholarships for college and there's absolutely zero reason to not allow her to use her college fund or her inheritance for a school that will only help her future.\n\nAnd lying to your kid? Wow.", "YTA for lying and for thinking a first house is somehow better than an elite education. \n\nGood Lord YTA.", "YTA. Who are you to decide that saving the inheritance is more important than her education? She uses to money to get a first class education and will be able to buy her own house.\n\nIt's totally despicable that you can't even stand behind your decision and lied to her because you are a coward. How do you expect her to ever trust you again? You need to fix this with the school.", "YTA\n\nThis is actually her money if she want's to spend it on her education that is up to her.\n\nYou did a very bad thing telling her she didn't get in I doubt she will ever trust you again.\n\nWell done for alienating your daughter!", "Yta for lying\n\nWhether not letting her use the inheritance is right or not depends on how that inheritance was setup\n\nYta for making that decision for her", "YTA\n\n> It's extremely competitive (approximately 10% acceptance rate)\n\n>  She was accepted\n\n> we told her she wasn't accepted\n\n#How MONSTROUS.", "YTA for lying. You should have told her she got in but financially you couldn\u2019t swing it. Also you have no business telling her how to spend her inheritance, $400k is plenty for her to attend this HS and still have a downpayment for a house.", "YTA. You lied to her. That makes you the asshole.\n\nIf you can't afford it, you can't afford it, and \"sorry, we can't afford that\" would be reasonable. But it looks like she can actually afford it. She has a $400K inheritance. She could spend $60K of that on school fees and still have plenty for a downpayment on a house.\n\nYou just decided not to let her do that.", "YTA.\n\nYou let her apply and devote time to seeing the school when you never intended to let her go there. Cruel move.\n\nYou lied when she was accepted so she wouldn't know. Devious, unethical, and dishonest.\n\nYou think a house is more important than a prep school which will help develop her amazing mind to it's full potential. Your priorities are skewed and you are dismissive of her wants and abilities and there would have been enough to accomplish both purposes. \n\nSo yes. You're the asshole. Of a huge magnitude. There is only one way to fix it. Get her into that school.", "Yes YTA. You have a child that wants to better her education and use her own money to do so. YTA for lying, YTA for not letting her use her money for education. Totally understand not letting her use her college fund, that\u2019s smart practical thinking, but her inheritance. IMO you should\u2019ve sat down with her and explained what you thought the \u201cbetter thing\u201d for her to use her inheritance on (house, car, future wedding whatever) instead of making decisions for her. Now you\u2019ve done what I can only imagine is irreparable damage to your relationship.", "YTA so many times over.\n\nThere are times where it's okay to lie to your kid.  Santa is a fun one, as is the tooth fairy, and telling a small child the dog went to a farm to run free softens a difficult loss, but all of those lies generally come to an end when the kid hits double digit ages, and they definitely aren't about something like education.  \n\nMost parents would be over the moon that their child is so intelligent AND determined to get a good education.  You've already confirmed that you can afford it for her using either funds dedicated to her education or with inheritance she'll eventually control but until then you can use for her betterment.  If it were just that there was no way to pay for it, you'd still be the asshole for lying about something so big.  It's not something trivial like a designer bag, it's her education.  If at 14 she's that dedicated to it, that's not a phase either.\n\nEven if you \"smooth\" things out short term, (and that's a big \"if\", I wouldn't blame her distancing herself from you as soon as she's 18) you'll definitely get spiteful jabs for this lie for the rest of your life.  I hope it was worth it.", "Yes, YTA. For lying and for trying to control how she spends an inheritance. Hope that helps", "Oh wow YTA so much!!! You LIED to her about being accepted instead of having an honest conversation about the financial issues. And about those financial issues\u2026..she has a HUGE inheritance that would have paid for it AND still been enough to give her an extremely healthy start in her adult life! What better purpose for what would be a small cut of that than to better her education which will help her for her entire life! What an incredibly short sighted, selfish thing to do. I just ugh, I can\u2019t put the words here to say what you are. Your daughter deserves better, you suck.", "YTA for how you handled this. You should've been transparent with her from the start and at least taken her input on how she wants to deal with the problem. She's not a 2 year old to be hoodwinked by a magic trick and be okay with it. If you told her the truth from the beginning she might have opted to not go through the application process at all. Instead she put in her time and effort only to be manipulated by her own parents in the end. It's highly disrespectful and if this is a pattern in your parenting style, don't expect her to treat you with any amount of respect when she gains autonomy over her own life.", "YTA you should have been upfront with her instead of lying. I understand why she is so upset. I understand you can\u2019t just give her full control of all her money but she\u2019s not asking for something ridiculous she wants a good education.", "YTA. Bad decisions from the beginning. Im sorry. It sucks trying to tell your kid no for something she deserves, that you would give her if you lived in a perfect world. Yes, youre the asshole for lying. Get over it. Now try to figure out how tf youre gonna repair your relationship with Lucy. Shes starting high school. These are gonna be really years, lots of new experiences, new opportunities. You want her to feel like she can trust you when she needs you. Dont see that happening right now.", "Ya know you AREN'T the one *providing* this education. This money is in a trust for her. You're supposed to have her  best interests at heart, but damn, you sure let your kid down.\n\n\nIt's HER money in trust for HER.\n\nAnd here you are telling her this super amazing school that she actually qualifies for is a piss poor use of money.\n\nWow.\n\nYTA", "YTA, terribly! By jove, if she was keen on spending her inheritance for partying, I'd consider understanding you, but you are extremely lucky to have a daughter thinking about her education at 14 (I teach to students of her age, at least half of them would choose a minimal effort school if it weren't for their parents), and you are deciding that buying a house is more important?? By the time she's ready to buy a house that money may not even be enough for that, give the current inflation rates!", "YT massive A.\n\nI was a kid like Lucy. My parents hid things I was offered for being academically advanced (camps, programs, scholarships) because they would be too hard (i.e. transportation issues) or because they were jealous (hi Dad). \n\nWhen I found out later, it permanently, irreparably destroyed my relationship with them.\n\nIt's not about not being able to afford it.\n\nIt's that you LIED TO HER.\n\nYou'd better fix this NOW. NOW NOW NOW. Someone as smart as Lucy isn't going to shake this off and \"just get over it.\" You're going to minimize it because she's \"only 14\" or think that you \"know better.\"\n\nYou don't.\n\nYou are going to regret this forever if you don't reverse course and get her in that school ASAP.", "YTA. Holy crap! You're gifted with a genius child who actually wants to go to school, who is excited about school, who wants to use money most kids would want to blow on a car or something to go to a better school - and your response is to lie and tell her she wasn't good enough to be accepted?\n\nI feel like you need to sit down and do some reflection and figure out why you're so against this, and why you were okay with telling her she wasn't good enough to get in, because there's something going on in that for you. Maybe you feel threatened by her intellectual gifts, maybe you're afraid of how it will make your other children reel, idk, but you have severely wronged your daughter.", "Massive YTA if true.\n\nYou're a liar for one and why is her education less important than buying a house with her own inheritance? \n\nSurely with the best education she would set herself up for a great job and earn enough for a great life anyway.\n\nSomething smells fishy, like, would she have less time to help out at the restaurant if she went to the better school and you enjoyed the free labour she was giving?\n\nDon't be surprised if she never forgives you.", "YTA.\n\nMassively.\n\nI can't believe you would LIE to Lucy and tell her she didn't get in.  Way to set a crappy example.  On top of that, I don't follow your logic about why - she should have been told the truth AND it sounds like she should have been allowed to go.  Buying a first house?  Doesn't come close to stacking up to an opportunity like this.  \n\nIf it's not too late, you need to reverse course, and you need to apologize to Lucy now, and probably for the rest of your life for this shitty lie.", "YTA for robbing your daughter of an amazing opportunity. \nShame on you.", "YTA.\n\nCongratulations on giving your daughter a core memory! She will never ever forget that you lied to her about something extremely important to her. She also knows that you cannot be trusted.\n\nOh, and if she finds out her siblings are part of the reasons as well, congratulations again on getting her to resent them too!", "Are you fucking kidding me?! Better education will allow her to make any of that sum in 10-15X more. You don't deserve her, you idiots! YTA", "YTA - Let's count the ways shall we:\n\n1.  You knew you couldn't afford it but you let her apply anyway instead of having an open conversation about it. \n2. Not only do you let her apply but you send her on a private tour and shadow day\n3. She then gets accepted but you lie to her about it, instead of being a parent and having an open conversation, which I'm sure made her feel like a failure.\n4. Not only does she get in but she gets financial aid scholarship to help with the tuition so that it's  45k you have to cover and you still don't try to find away to let her attend.\n5. You are acting like her finding out and being upset is her fault.... This is 100% on you.\n6. She has 2 different funds in order to take this money from and you want let her have access to them. This isn't her being 16 and wanting a 60k car. She is using this money for education! \n\n>I again said no, it should be used for a better purpose, like buying her first house\n\n7. This could set up her future to get into a better college than she may get into if she were   \ngoing to a public school and you guys act like she's trying to blow money on a shopping   \nspree or something. And if she does she might could pay that 45k back to her house   \nfund in the 1st year or 2 out of college because she got an amazing job because of the   \nresources that she was set up with. YOU ARE NOT SEEING THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.", "YTA.  Massively so.  She has the resources to make this happen - which could be huge for her future - and you are obstructing it.  Why?  Because it will make trouble with her younger siblings?  Because you think she should use the money on a house?  That so very short sighted.  Worst of all - you lied.  Why?  Because you were too cowardly to approach the situation in a straightforward way.  And now it will very possibly cost you your relationship with your daughter because she wont forget a betrayal like this.", "Wow, YTA, one for lying and two for betting on your daughter to fail rather than speak truthfully to her.  Way to destroy the trust.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide what she spends her inheritance money on and if anything you should be happy that she wants to spend her inheritance money on a good education. She\u2019s clearly very bright and I think it\u2019d be a mistake to let this chance slip away", "Lying always makes YTA.", "YTA. The connections she could make and getting into a better college are worth it. \n\nAnd you\u2019re liars. \n\nKeep holding her back to work in your restaurant. That won\u2019t alienate her at all.", "YTA \n\nThe answer should have been to not get her hopes up in the first place and say you couldn't afford it. Not lie and probably make her feel like a failure", "Yta she has fudging FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS and you don't think 60k to a good school is a good cause???????  Whats going to be a good enough reason????", "YTA 100% and you lied to your kid about this? If your kid loses touch in a few years you will know THIS fiasco is the reason. Come up with the money and let your kid go to the private school, if she is genuinely gifted don\u2019t waste her talents she can be a doctor or scientist etc. or let her use the inheritance  60k isn\u2019t gonna buy much house or be even a great down payment stop being an AH will you please", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't a matter of \"we can't afford\", since there apparently are more than adequate resources available.  This is a case of, \"we don't want to let her get ahead\" or, more likely, \"we don't want to lose the free labor of this child in our restaurant.\"\n\nYour decision making is so short-sighted here.  My guess as to the behind-the-scenes thing is that you don't want her to have an advantage over the older daughter and are intentionally holding her back.  That's going to sabotage her relationship with her older sibling as well.\n\nWe don't even need to go into the issue of lying to your child.  You've effectively created a situation where she will never trust you or your husband again for the rest of her life.\n\nAnd you're going to be so surprised when your daughter takes that inheritance (assuming you haven't completely spent it or buggered it up by then) and leaves to never speak to you again.\n\nBut hey - this is one of your \"proud parent\" moments.  (Also, don't think that the other kids haven't noticed that \"Mom and dad lie about important stuff\".  That is likely to come back and bite you -- and rightfully so.\n\nEDIT - I just had a realization and should have thought of it before.  Mom doesn't want to turn loose of the money in the trust because THEY HAVE USED IT TO COLLATERALIZE LOANS FOR THE RESTAURANT.  It's tied up and they can't get it out without having a significant interest rate hike for their bills.  (This assumes they aren't already dipping into the till to pay expenses for the business with the idea that they will, '... pay it back\" when the restaurant business recovers.   \n That, and the ability to get free labor from the daughter suddenly make this course of action make sense.", "Why would you think buying a house would be more important than this child getting the education she wants?  I'm sure she will be able to buy her own house when the time comes.  I mean if she has 400K, let her use it for her education, maybe when she hits college she can work and pay any additional costs or get scholarships.  You should have never lied but rather have a discussion together on how/where the money to pay for it would come from.  YTA", "YTA\n\nFor lying. For letting her think she hadn\u2019t gotten in rather than telling her the truth. For going through the entire application process if you were going to say no. For having options for payment but dismissing them all out of hand, and for not trying other avenues.\n\nFor lying. Oh, the lying, it all comes back to the lying. You chose breaking your girl\u2019s heart and having her think she wasn\u2019t good enough over being honest about money. YTA YTA YTA.", "YTA absolutely and massively. \n\nComing from a university student who studies biochemistry and works as hard as hell, I know just what kind of amazing opportunity that would have been for her, especially if she had funds for it. You say that 445k should be used for college? You do realize with scholarships your daughter will most likely and no doubt will receive, she will most likely have a free ride anywhere she wants to go, and if she wants to further her education, something such as medical school will cost MAYBE $160k in total (typical price range or so) and even then there are scholarships and such. She would have plenty left over, and if you say you haven\u2019t tried to even gain interest on that money or expand it\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how you handle your finances then. \n\nOh also, good luck OP, you absolutely just shattered the trust of your daughter and getting that back is going to take forever. You owe her a massive apology, but with the way you seem to be parenting\u2026 I doubt even that will help.", "YTA for lying. Y\u2019all also could afford it you just have opinions on what she should spend her money on. Chances are that a crazy competitive private high school  education at a 75% discount would help her get scholarships to make college cheaper.\n\n\nETA: You have no idea what the housing market will be like in the future let alone where she will be living so your points pretty moot.", "YTA. A bit late now, you've irreparabley destroyed your relationship with your daughter, so congrats on fucking up the most important job you'll ever have I guess.", "YTA for lying. The money stuff I care less about but straight up lying to you kid like that is just shitty parenting. She will ALWAYS remember.", "Oh my god you were such an asshole! Jfc. Your poor kid. That money could be used to help her NOW. With a better education maybe she could have gotten a full scholarship to some college, you just have to talk to her about working hard and choosing the right focuses of study to make sure that's the case. Or hell she can take out college loans like everyone else does, and they don't die. Those people realize that educational opportunities are more important than cash, why don't you? \n\nI realize for a restaurant owner it is hard to understand how much money the next generation can make these days, but making ~150k/yr is not uncommon for certain degrees right out of college. And if course the lifetime earning potential for a better school and degree vs a more average one is in the tens of millions these days. Why would you not invest in that? See just how high she can fly? The scarcity mindset about money is so gross. It makes sense to have scarcity mindset when you are broke but you have money!\n\nIf she gets a good job she can use that to buy a house! Duh! And as others said, using 60k for private school still leaves a huge amount for the house! But this way you diversify and invest in HER\n\nPut that money to work for HER now. Education and career prospects compound to create more wealth. If your kid truly is smart enough to use these exclusive opportunities, it can be a much better of an investment return than the interest you can get on that investment leaving it in the stock market or wherever that money is sitting, not really doing any good for her.", "YTA. Lying pretty much cinched that one. Lying is never, ever the answer. It will always come back to bite you in the ass. \n\nIt's all well and good that you wanted to save that 400k for a house or something, but a house is nowhere near as important as an education. An education at a first rate HS can set her up with a multitude of scholarships at first rate colleges. A house can be a money pit that not everyone wants. She's 14. She needs a good education right now not a house in 20 years.", "YTA - you lied to your kid.", "YTA. A massive one. Huge. What is wrong with you?", "YTA. What is a better investment in her future than the best education she can get?", "YTA. Lying to your child about something so important as her education is absolutely wrong. Not only that, this school sounds like it would have been a great fit for her, and it would have been a great use of her inheritance. Do you just want to enjoy the fact of having a bright child without doing your utmost to allow her brightness to lead to the best possible life? Shame on you.", "YTA. Lying was a huge mistake. You broke her trust. She got in, received a scholarship, and honestly you do have the money to pay for the school. Geez\u2026$340,000 would buy an incredible house outright. Whether or not your younger children receive the same education is irrelevant. You have one gifted child right in front of you now. Plus, the opportunities the private school could offer for college\u2026that is value added. Let her attend. You know it is the right thing to do.", "YTA\n\nIf she actually has inheritance that can cover her 4 years at this private high school, WTF were you thinking? She wasn't looking to buy a sports car, she was looking to get a good education.", "YTA for getting her hopes up like that. Sounds like the money is there but you value her buying a home later over an education that will enable her to get into a better university and then she can buy her own houses. As far as the other kids, you don\u2019t hold one kid back for a situation that may not occur. If they were all gifted that would be one thing but that doesn\u2019t sound like the case.", "YTA, if you had absolutely zero intention of her going to that school (because you can't afford it/ unfairness with siblings etc) you should have never wasted her time or gotten her hopes up by having her apply, test, tours etc. Now she gets to see firsthand what she's missing out on and she gets to know that she not only got her application approved, she even got a lot of financial aid- the only thing she can see is getting in her way is you.  Also- it does sound like  you can easily afford it, 400k inheritance, 45k college fund already- sounds like you just aren't willing to invest in your child.", "YTA you did not make a single good choice in this whole story", "YTA.\n\nYou did a major screwup here.  You lied to her because you still treat her like a child who has no say.  This is likely a permanent rift.", "YTA\n\n#Your reasoning is faulty and short-sighted.\n#\nGoing to a school that's specialized for her abilities would put Lucy in the ideal position to win a lot more grants, scholarships, and bursaries.\n\nShe could also get a great job and help her sibs attend college via family loans.\n\nYou've ruined her goodwill toward you by lying and denying her an opportunity.\n\nIf this school is too expensive, is there a cheaper school that will still give her access to a better education?\n\nYou have some research to do, or maybe Lucy does with your encouragement.\n\n#Take the long view.\n#", "YTA.\n\nStomping on her confidence.  Lying.\n\nSome mom.", "YTA, with family like you who needs enemies. Fyi my sister went to a private school and they help immensely with university applications and tips on how and where students should apply based on their subjects. You're robbing her of opportunities she will not have at a regular school, nevermind that you lied and probably set some insecurities deeply in place that won't be resolved even though she found out you lied.\n\n Why did you lie? It seems you guys are almost jealous of her intellect, otherwise the obvious decision would be to use her college fund or inheritance for this school. Have the rest of your kids got inheritances or college funds? If so why would it matter how your daughter spends hers?  They'll use theirs on college and she'll use hers on school. You're a seriously terrible parent if you think just because you can't pay for the rest of them to go to private school that she shouldn't either. If they have inheritances and college funds they should too, if they get into the school, but if they don't and it's only her with a college fund and inheritance then it's a completely different situation.

I wouldn't talk to you either.", "Lying to your kid, instead of sitting down and explaining why, after more thorough thought, you felt that you couldn't send her to private school was a cowardly thing to do as her parents, and it will foster distrust resentment that will go far into the future.

Does it set her up for future scholarships, connections, or networking opportunities?  If the answer is yes to ANY of these, why squander this opportunity? You said yourself, she is extremely bright and based on your writing you seem very proud to have her as a daughter. Yet, you saying no to this, AFTER she was accepted, screams, \"I don't believe in you.\" At the very least, it says,\" I didn't actually think you'd get accepted.\"  The issue isn't finances because you state  there is money set aside \"for a house\" and she has also a college fund. This is applicable, as this pertains to her education. Is there a program that allows her to get an associates while at the school?

Either give her the money or say goodbye because she will never speak to you again.\n\nAH\u2019a 100% of the way", "YTA big time, education is key. Your child is smarter than you.", "OP is an idiot besides being an AH. My son was extremely gifted in math and sciences. We sent him to the best private school in our area and scrimped to pay the $80k plus tuition for 4 years. The end result a ton of AP classes he was able to transfer and a full ride at his college of choice. Free ride. MIT. SMH. With a parent like OP, that poor kid it\u2019s screwed. YTA for the rest of her life.", "You\u2019re joking op right? An education at a great high school sets kids up for massive success, there really isn\u2019t a better purpose for her inheritance.", "YTA. \n     First of all, if you were going to let her apply, there should have been a conversation about cost/being able to afford it prior. She is clearly very intelligent and driven, and would have understood. You could have even come up with a plan. \n     Second, you did not even go to the school to discuss further financial assistance, which many private schools will offer. As someone who went to a private school K-12, after COVID, the school privately funded tuition for children whose parents could no longer afford it. Actually, they did that with students who applied and got in and students already enrolled, even prior to COVID, if they could not afford it. \n     Third, you lied to her. You will never be able to fully regain that trust. You should have sat her down and had a conversation about cost AFTER going to the school to converse with them about it. My parents were able to afford private schooling and another private school wanted me to attend so badly they completely cut tuition out, which I\u2019m sure this school would be able to do considering the principal (or whatever administrator) asked her to apply. They clearly want her there. \n     Fourth, the opportunities from a prestigious private school and the resources they offer far exceed that of most public schools. They often have college counselors that work with only a small portion of students, from freshman to senior year, to best set them up for college. Additionally, these counselors will reach out to colleges to vouch for students and discuss financial aid. They walk students through applications, applications for scholarships, and FAFSA. They also often offer private tutoring for standardized tests and greater class options. There also tend to be donors from these private schools who offer college scholarships. \n      Fifth, the return on going to a prestigious private school is fairly great. It offers networking opportunities, because a lot of alumni go to prestigious universities. The prestige of the high school can also play a role in college acceptance. Additionally, private college prep high schools prepare students for college much better than public schools generally. Private schools also do not teach for the state exams, they teach for college. \n      Sixth, you do not know what the housing market will do. It is very possible that what could provide a down payment on a house today will not do the same in ten years, when she enters the job market. Once again, education is generally the best path to financial security. Particularly if she wants to go into a STEM field. \n\nI would like to reiterate, YTA. You are not best setting your child up for the future by denying her the opportunity for a better education, you are hindering her. You need to rectify this situation and go to the school to discuss further financial aid or let her use her inheritance. You need to apologize deeply and have a conversation explaining that what you did was wrong, and the steps you are taking to rectify it, and involve her in the process of trying to figure out a solution to let her go to that school. \n\nThe greatest gift you can give to your children outside of being a good parent, is education.", "If she has a 400K nest egg, 60,000 for a gifted budding scientist to attend a specialized high school for four years will be money well spent.

My friend's oldest daughter graduated high school with an associates. She's on her second year at a nearby university and graduates in spring with her bachelors at 20 years old. My own teenager was looking into dual credits while she's in high school and is already taking AP classes to get some college classes knocked out. A private school like that would be invaluable to this kid's future if the parents would stop thinking so short sighted.", "I did. Was a big help.", "I went to a school like that. I was on the extreme end, but I graduated high school with enough AP credit to place out of a year of college at places where AP credits count towards graduation.", "I have a friend who graduated high school with an associate's degree.  That's two year of college, way cheaper than doing it while in college.", "Where I am, it's common for kids to graduate with 2 years of college behind them. They would just be using the college money for high school, but accomplishing the same thing. Besides, she's got $400K sitting there? \n\nShe's super smart, and this school is an opportunity for her to fulfill her potential, and put her on a path to a better college, and a better career. 10 years from now, the money spent on education today is going to look like the best investment they ever made.", "Ehh that\u2019s stretching it, but what those classes did for me when i got to college was never taking 18 credit semesters (and at the end even taking 12s) never taking summer classes etc. \n\nI was able to actually enjoy my experience because it bought me time to not overwork myself. \n\n\nDo you understand how much time you can have with 12 credits in a sem and some of them are online classes?", "Duel credit hasn't been allowed since like the 1800s", "Prep school can get you into a good business school so she could franchise!", "That's terrible to stifle your talent like that.", "I'm so sorry you experienced that!", "Yes, that was my read as well. OP used her like a trick pony with her phenomenal memory.", "Lucy is the 14 year old not the 21 year old from the first marriage so it's almost worse... This inheritance isn't from the departed mom but the grandparents and the kid is her own child (mentioning the departed mom and elder step daughter was a red herring in the post)", "The 14yo is OP\u2019s bio child. The inheritance came from the fathers parents. I still think OP\u2019s the ah though and fully support the kid going nc at 18", "You read it wrong. Lucy is OP\u2019s bio child and the inheritance is from the grandparents, not a dead mother.", "But do we know that the money is actually there?", "OP is the mother of the child in question. The $400k is from the late STEP grandparents of said child.", "Hi friendo!", "Not even a full ride. Sometimes that's not even needed. Because, \n\nAnyone who gets into the top colleges in the USA benefits from those top colleges' \"meets all need without loans\" policy.\n\nNot many people know about this but about 20 to 30 colleges in the USA *absolutely promise* they will give you the amount of money you \"need\" without requiring you to take out loans.\n\nThe \"need\" is per the FAFSA.\n\nMy youngest is at MIT. If his FAFSA says we can afford $10,000, than MIT makes sure we *only* pay $10,000. They make sure he has the rest funded *without loans.*\n\nhttps://blog.prepscholar.com/colleges-that-offer-complete-financial-aid\n\nSo, if you get into one of these schools, *there is absolutely no question* if they will fund you or not. There is *absolutely no* loans pushed at you. You don't have to compete for scholarships. It's just automatic: You will *absolutely be given* the amount that the FAFSA says you need. \n\nEvery. Single. Person. who can get in those schools is guaranteed to *never pay* more than the FAFSA. \n\nThey don't have to do anything else. They don't have to compete for scholarships. They don't have to compete against other students in the college.\n\n If they get into this college , it is just accepted and expected that the college will give them enough.\n\nI always share this because not A lot of people understand this or know about this policy.", "Plus her starting salary and earning potential will be much Much higher. Buying her first home will be a non-issue. Besides there will still be $340K of her inheritance left over.\n\nOP and her husband are a couple of dum dums. How they have such a bright kid is beyond science.", "Exactly!! Chances are very good that she isn't even going to need her \"college fund\".", "No, op says tuition is almost $60k per year, so it's almost $180k for four years after scholarship is deducted.", "That's the yearly value of the scholarship.", "A mean a few, but I'm not sure where you got that. I was talking about schools in the neighborhood of $50k/year.", "They also discounted the daughter\u2019s intelligence in their lies to her.  YTA", "A lot of the time private school doesn\u2019t give that big of a leg up in life, but there are certain schools where it does make an absolutely massive difference. \n\nI live within an hour of a handful of private boarding schools where the tuition is about $60k a year. When I was in middle school I would go to the schools for rowing competitions and knew a few people who eventually got in on scholarships. The experiences they got to have and the doors that opened up for them because of it were absolutely incredible and not something they would have ever been able to have had they not attended. It set them up for very, very different lives then they would have otherwise had.", "First, you are under the assumption that the other kids can get into that school as its incredibly competitive and this child is very gifted. She's doing collegiate work before fully settling into her freshman year of high school. The other kids do not 'get nothing'.. they all have an inheritance to pull from when they need to for education. A $400K inheritance. They have an exceptionally gifted child who has needs who are different from her other siblings. If she had a learning disability instead of a gift, people would advocate that that child is given the education that it needs, so why is it different when the child in question is remarkably intelligent? It is absolutely absurd to assess that a parent has to drag down a gifted child because they assume that this takes something away from their other children. They have taken away opportunity and confidence from this child with no regret or apology and lied to her face about how she is perceived as well. This is abhorrent parenting.", "The daughter has an inheritance of $400 thousand,  she would be spending her own money on her self  , not depriving her siblings", "OP hasn\u2019t provided any information about whether the other kids have similar access to money as this child, or interest in a private school. There is definitely potential for resentment, which is why OP needs to speak with all the kids and teach them about why different people need different things. If this child has a 400k inheritance from OP\u2019s husband\u2019s parents, I\u2019d assume the younger kids may also have access to funds, and if they are also academically gifted enough to get such scholarships to elite private schools, they could go too. \n\nI firmly believe that with good guidance and parenting these kids will understand why their sister is getting a different school experience. If OP is proactive and transparent with all the kids, they can be helped to understand what the deal is. Treating your kids equally does not always mean treating them the same- different kids thrive in different ways. The younger kids may have zero interest in attending a rigorous STEM school. OP has to communicate with them about it, though, which is clearly not her forte. \n\nThis is not an insurmountable obstacle, OP is just using it as an excuse.", "Why would the others get nothing? The others might be able to get into this school, if they want, on the same terms as Lucy - that it comes out of their inheritance. Or the other child might be really talented at music and get into a specialist school. Or they might get into a sports programme, or any other opportunities that might come. It's not this specific private school or 'nothing'.", "Yes, I came here to say, my daughter made a fortune in high school tutoring math and Spanish. She was fortunate to have jobs that were stimulation throughout school. She was able to save up for a car and pay the insurance and have more opportunities because she had a car.", "Maybe not, but her inheritance and college fund will go a lot farther if she has a year or two less to pay for.", "They go in as freshmen with transfer credit, and can start as sophomore level. They are eligible for scholarships. This is in regular schools. In really academically rigorous schools, they EXPECT you to have done higher level classes, and you will struggle if you don't, but more likely than not you will just not get accepted", "They do it with conjunction with the community college.\n\nYTA OP and a huge one. You made her doubt herself so you could control her money.", "She could possibly have taken a bunch of AP classes and been placed in more advanced classes in college.", "My kid is dual enrolled in college courses in a public HS as well, but given how OP\u2019s kid is a private school will offer the best education.", "Underrated", "This comment hasn't been appreciated enough. \n\n\ud83c\udfc6 take my poor redditors award.", "what are you talking about? my junior and senior year of high school (2010 & 2011) I took dual credit German classes and got out of having to take a foreign language in college.", "How are her father\u2019s parents her step-grandparents?", "Thank you for sharing this!

It would be 60k for all 4 years in total.  You are comparing apples and oranges.", "With 2 boys my daughter paid $44,000 per yr in high school.

So he got the college and highschool credit.", "Google \"duel\" and see when it was made illegal in the US", "Yes, check out the top schools if financial aid is an issue. They are trying to tackle student debt this way.", "Ah, yes, you're right. I apologize, I misunderstood the $15k to be that's what the grant is and they'd pay $45k per year. This makes OP an even bigger asshole.", ">but it's nearly $60k a year.", "jesus, i literally laughed out loud at this", "But kids are still allowed to take college to finish high school. There\u2019s strict guidelines for it, but I knew 5 diff kids that finished high school in college and only had to go 2 more years to get a bachelor\u2019s degree.", "first it\u2019s \u2018dual\u2019 and literally i googled \u2018dual credit courses illegal\u2019 and the first result is:\n> Yes.

That reduces the fees to $15k per year.", "Jesus....that was my whole joke...how the comment I was replying to said \"duel credit\" and duels have been outlawed in the US since the mid 1800s....\n\nAll these AP students and y'all getting worked on duel vs dual", "It's confusing because OP doesn't want people to realize what a psycho she is being when her daughter is sitting on $400k which I'm SURE the grandparents wanted to be used for exactly this type of situation.", "None of them can read, apparently \ud83e\udd23"]}
