Because that matters to my partner, and my partner matters to me.\n\nYour step-dad is *not* a nice man, and he's not committed to your mother. You're not wrong. But your mother has made it clear she will choose this man over you if you force the issue, and this hill is not big enough to be worth dying on. You can't force your mother to value herself and her principles. Staying away from her over this issue will only hurt you both without accomplishing anything."]}
