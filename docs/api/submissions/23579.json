{"id": 23579, "submission_id": "15ehr1o", "title": "AITA for not wanting my wife to go on vacation?", "selftext": "An opportunity has arisen for my wife to go to the beach for a week in October with her friend. She asked if I was ok with her going,  to which I originally responded (honestly) that I was not ok with it. \n\nWe have a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Daycare opens at 6:30am, which is also when I need to be at work. So my wife usually drops them off,  and I'll pick them up after work since I get off earlier than she does. She works one full time job,  that has allowed her to work 2 days from home each week because of our infant, and then has weekends off. I work a full time job during the week,  and a part time job on the weekend. (So effectively I have no days off. )\n\nMy wife gets up in the mornings and gets the kids ready,  and usually gets up with the baby at night as well,  as she gets more days off/ at home. Were she to take vacation,  this would of course all fall on me. I could probably manage to be late to work all week without issue,  as long as I stayed later to make up for it. \n\nI told her I was uncomfortable with her leaving for so long. I understand needing a break from the kids,  but there's a difference between me watching them for a day so she can relax and her straight up taking a whole spring break. Not to mention,  she also has a 3 day work trip at the end of this month that will put us in the same scenario. It's a lot for one person, and originally,  I did not want children. Granted,  I love them more than anything now,  but ultimately,  I feel like this is the life she chose for herself and she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled. \n\nShe responded that she's not being entitled because she's just asking me to do what she does every day. She feels like I'm telling her that she can be a mother and nothing else. I don't think this is true,  I think I'm just asking her to be a mother FIRST. I know she does a lot as a mother,  and I appreciate it greatly,  but admittedly I do not feel like I'm capable of doing what she does every day.  I do not get the days off/ home that she does,  and I honestly don't have the patience I should with the infant.\n\nAfter much back and forth,  I begrudgingly told her that she could go and that I would just figure it out, and if I absolutely had to,  I would take PTO from work to make sure the kids are taken care of. She said not to worry about it,  she just won't go. I don't want her to be bitter about it,  because I completely understand needing a vacation,  especially from kids/ family, and have offered alternatives,  like watching them for a weekend so she can do as she pleases,  to which she was not very receptive.  Am I the asshole ?\n\nEdit: people seem to be hung up on the \"this is the life she chose for herself\" part.  I do not say this to say that she deserves more of the burden of parenting. A lot of assumptions suggest that I do not parent while she slaves away.  I feed and bathe and father my kids as well. It is a team effort, but taking over her share while working 60 hours a week is overwhelming af. When i say she chose this for herself, I mean that getting things her way on her own time becomes much less reasonable, and i feel like she refuses to accept this,  or is largely unwilling to compromise when it comes to giving up things she wants.\n\nAnother Edit: I have no problem being a father.  That's not the issue.  In fact, last year before I switched to my current jobs,  there was a good 8 to 10 months where I worked at night,  and kept our toddler during the day to save on daycare costs. It was great.  Who doesn't want to watch Bluey all day?  I CAN do what she does every day.  I CANNOT do what she does AND what I do everyday.", "created_utc": 1690813749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ehr1o/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to_go_on_vacation/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So she\u2019s on duty 7 days a week.", "I think you have valid reasons for REASONABLE concern, but the way most of the post is phrased is not reasonable. Reasonable concern is trying to work TOGETHER with your wife to figure out childcare on the weekend she\u2019s away (or working to see if she can go from Mon-Fri instead of the weekend too), for example. \n\nThe problem is that you\u2019re very focused on certain factors that make you seem like an AH\u2014stating your wife wanted kids more so she should shoulder the responsibility \u201cshe chose,\u201d stating you don\u2019t know many mothers who\u2019d leave their kids for that long, etc, bringing her work trip into it (when that\u2019s not relevant to this issue especially since that trip is in August?), and stating you\u2019re not patient with your infant. These moments seem to point to a bigger issue\u2014if you\u2019re feeling burnt out as a father or resentful that you have this responsibility you didn\u2019t really want, those are valid feelings to have, but you need to communicate about that.\n\nYou and your wife are in completely different lanes right now and (from your post at least), seemingly not working together at all. What\u2019s your concern with your wife being gone for so long, OP? From your post, it seems like it\u2019s because you can\u2019t handle parenting at the level she does. But you haven\u2019t mentioned any other concerns except for that you\u2019d be late to work (which you\u2019ve said would be fine). I have empathy for you feeling overwhelmed with parenting, but then that reinforces the reason your wife probably needs this vacation in the first place (if we put it this way, she has a full-time job AND a \u201cpart time\u201d job which is parenting after work and on the weekends\u2014I\u2019m not saying that parenting is part time lol but just to illustrate to OP).\n\nAgain, you have every right for reasonable concern and reasonable compromise.

Possibly less actually because you'd take the kids some days.", "Since you are counting your wife's work from home days where she is parenting and working at the same time as days off, I'm going to go with YTA. \n\nYou consider parenting days as days off, so go ahead and take your PTO and parent on your days off.", "INFO: Would you also decline a solo trip for yourself? If the answer is yes, then N A H, I understand both of your points of view. Although you are a bit of an AH for stating that you don\u2019t know other *mothers* that are away for so long. Seems like you would be more understanding for a father to be away. And were both pregnancies unplanned? Because if nit it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you originally wanted children, you chose them anyway. But you seem to use this as an argument for her taking more of the burden which isn\u2019t fair. \n\nWhen do you feel like it would be appropriate for either of you to spend a night away (for leisure not work obviously)? Or what conditions have to be met? You might want to discuss this now or it will keep coming up.\n\nEdit: another question: when was the last time you were away alone over night for a non work related occasion?", "YTA. \nThese are your children, right?

(I *did* read further, but I didn't *have* to.) \n\nThat is some Grade A First Class Shoeshine Bullshit.  She's not just asking you to do what she does every day. She's asking you to do what she does every day ALONG WITH what you already do every day.  60 hour work week plus ALL the child care?  That is not a fair ask by any stretch at all.  \n\nI fully understand that she needs and even deserves a vacation, but you're already doing a week and a half's work every week PLUS the childcare you also do. It would be a lot more fair if you took the kids to visit their grandparents so you could both take a week off, and either spend it together or separately with friends. \n\nYour wife is being selfish.

I get that she probably exhausted with a very young baby and a toddler, but perhaps with a little bit more advanced planning and enlisting some babysitting help it would be doable? \n\nOP, where you're an AH is because you have just kind of rolled over and basically said, 'Nope, I can't do everything she does.\" without ever having tried. It would be difficult, no doubt. But you have an obligation to learn to parent your children on your own should the situation warrant. There are two months in which to find and plan for a sitter or nanny to help you navigate the children while your wife gets some probably badly needed rest. With you doing all that you are, you are probably going to need the same at some point. Your wife needs the rest and a week isn't really too long a request.", "NTA- I could see a night off or a weekend trip but a whole week is a lot to cover. Working 60hrs a week to provide and still helping is a lot, so to add more seems exterior to me.

OP going on vacation for a week while his wife works a full-time job and a part-time job on the weekends. All while having a 3yr and 4mo at home.", "Your wife works 3 days at the office and 2 days  from home while caring for an infant. You work a part time job on the weekends so effectively you have no days off. Effectively neither does your wife unless she has a sitter on the weekend. You initially didn\u2019t want children but ultimately THIS IS THE LIFE YOU CHOSE FOR YOURSELF. Now, the fact that your wife wants a week away from your four month old is concerning. How is her mental health? Did she get enough of a chance to recover from pregnancy and birth before returning to work? I ask this because no way would I have wanted a solid week away from my 4 month old. The first time I took a week away was when my oldest was 10 months old and by day 4 I wanted to come home . Please check in with wife and really listen to her. Please don\u2019t play the \u201cI have it just as bad as you\u201d game with her. You don\u2019t have to deal with the hormonal issues of pregnancy and postpartum. It\u2019s takes 9 months to gestate a baby and I swear just as long to recover physically and emotionally. So ask her if she is ok, and if she is overwhelmed. Please be a compassionate partner who doesn\u2019t blame his wife for struggling, or needing help, or feeling like she needs to get away.

You offered alternatives as you felt a week was too long, but they did not work for her. If you work long hours and do more than one job, your wife needs to at least seek some help from other family members / close friends to help you out in her absence in order to make a week long vacation a viable option.

Also you have 2 kids, this isn't your first rodeo, why are you okay with admitting you wouldn't be able to handle your kids if your wife (goddess forbid) dies or ends up in the hospital? You're their father. Not their uncle. Which means you should be completely capable of handling them on your own. Also would the excuse \"I'm not capable of doing that\" work on your boss? Nope.

Coz if not she still has less free time than you do if you get time off from parenting and work.

I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled\n\nYes you do, because you find it inconvenient, you just don't want to sound selfish. You failed. \n \nAnd the reason you think she's entitled is probably because most of the dads you personally know are not actually *good* fathers who can handle their kids on their own. If you can't handle your children for 7 days, thats not a flex. In fact, it's a huge red flag.\nI know several women who can pick up for a week's work trip with a few days notice and leave their babies with their father. Coz you know... He's also their parent, and actually learned how to be one when the babies were born. No one is born with that knowledge, whatever our biological sex. It's learned.

Your wife actually IS entitled to a break - because she has been doing 100% of everything since the first child was born, and I am willing to bet you are just as much a child as the two of them are as well, based on your level of whining here.\n\nShe said to forget it, she\u2019s not going?

I do not say this to say that she deserves more of the burden of parenting. A lot of assumptions suggest that I do not parent while she slaves away. I feed and bathe and father my kids as well. It is a team effort, but taking over her share while working 60 hours a week is overwhelming af. When i say she chose this for herself, I mean that getting things her way on her own time becomes much less reasonable, and i feel like she refuses to accept this, or is largely unwilling to compromise when it comes to giving up things she wants.\n\nIt's a week at the beach dude. \n\nSometimes in order to be the best mother/father you can be you need to go be the best YOU for a while. \n\nShe needs to remember how to be her own person and not just \"Mom\" because that's just one aspect of who she is. \n\nYTA, and kinda a shitty partner in this as well.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t want kids and now you\u2019re saddled with the responsibility.

First of all, if she's working from home and take care of the kids at the same time, she's already doing way more than you are. She's working two jobs at once, because working from home is not the same as a day off. It is still work. In sick and tired of this working from home isn't work attitude from each other's spouses. It's b*******. Would you expect her to watch the kids if she was in the office? Would you be telling her that it's not a big deal if she was doing it that way? So why is it a big deal if she's doing it at home? She still working, she's still clocked in.\n\nSecond of all, this is the life you both chose. Unless you guys use the sperm donor so that you are not the biological father, you decided to have kids too. You may not have wanted them, but you certainly had fun making them so now it's your job to suck it up and parent them as well. It sucks, but sometimes you have to use your PTO to take care of your kids. My mom had to do it, multiple times.

She asked if I was ok with her going,  to which I originally responded (honestly) that I was not ok with it. \n\nWe have a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Daycare opens at 6:30am, which is also when I need to be at work. So my wife usually drops them off,  and I'll pick them up after work since I get off earlier than she does. She works one full time job,  that has allowed her to work 2 days from home each week because of our infant, and then has weekends off. I work a full time job during the week,  and a part time job on the weekend. (So effectively I have no days off. )\n\nMy wife gets up in the mornings and gets the kids ready,  and usually gets up with the baby at night as well,  as she gets more days off/ at home. Were she to take vacation,  this would of course all fall on me. I could probably manage to be late to work all week without issue,  as long as I stayed later to make up for it. \n\nI told her I was uncomfortable with her leaving for so long. I understand needing a break from the kids,  but there's a difference between me watching them for a day so she can relax and her straight up taking a whole spring break. Not to mention,  she also has a 3 day work trip at the end of this month that will put us in the same scenario. It's a lot for one person, and originally,  I did not want children. Granted,  I love them more than anything now,  but ultimately,  I feel like this is the life she chose for herself and she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled. \n\nShe responded that she's not being entitled because she's just asking me to do what she does every day. She feels like I'm telling her that she can be a mother and nothing else. I don't think this is true,  I think I'm just asking her to be a mother FIRST. I know she does a lot as a mother,  and I appreciate it greatly,  but admittedly I do not feel like I'm capable of doing what she does every day.  I do not get the days off/ home that she does,  and I honestly don't have the patience I should with the infant.\n\nAfter much back and forth,  I begrudgingly told her that she could go and that I would just figure it out, and if I absolutely had to,  I would take PTO from work to make sure the kids are taken care of. She said not to worry about it,  she just won't go. I don't want her to be bitter about it,  because I completely understand needing a vacation,  especially from kids/ family, and have offered alternatives,  like watching them for a weekend so she can do as she pleases,  to which she was not very receptive.

Sit down and talk with your wife to determine how best to navigate things going forward before the resentment on both your parts builds beyond repair. This whole situation will not fix itself. You both vowed and committed to each other, not just for when it\u2019s easy. Learn new ways to parent, cope and be partners together without keeping score.

Treat each day as it is new, with a resolve to manage through the challenges in a loving and unified intention. One more piece of advice: once you both get your separate reset, make sure you\u2019re making time for each other. 20 minutes a day, date night after the kids go to bed, just enjoy each other.

Lets judge the actual situation and not nitpick the various ways people misspeak", "Yes, and she isn\u2019t being left entirely alone all day and night for seven days. \n\nShe works two jobs - one \u2018classic\u2019 job and the other is doing a larger portion of the childcare.\n\nHe works two \u2018classic\u2019 jobs - one full time and one part time and contributes his portion of the children\u2019s care. In this scenario, he is also expected to pick of her larger portion as well, essentially taking on a second full time job in addition to the part time job.\n\nThis isn\u2019t that hard to comprehend - it is too high of an expectation of one individual, and that goes both ways if he were to take off for a week as well.", "This is a fair comment, I did forget that not everyone is fortunate to get good PTO.", "If he has PTO, doesn\u2019t have to use it. He can arrange something with his job or the day care. Hey can I drop my kids off a little earlier or hey would it be all right if I come into work a little later these days, and offer to stay later.", "*quietly points to numerous comments (including mine) where it\u2019s said both parents deserve a break*", "Was this something that was said by OP? He says she's able to work from home 2 days a week due to the infant but also says drops \"them\" off. \n\n\"I'm able to pick the kids up and be home by 4pm every day. My wife gets home around 5/530, so I'll juggle them both until she gets home.\"\n\nSo even if she does only drop the oldest off on the days shes WFH, thats still 3/5 in daycare.", "The kids are in day care\u2026nowhere does it say she takes care of the infant when working from home", "He doesn't have the flexibility that she does on weekends. He has to be away from home for his job. How does he take care of kids on a weekend when daycares are closed? Either family support or pay someone which potentially defeats the purpose of working if the part time job doesn't pay well.", "Yes he stated she for WRH because of the baby not that baby stay home", "They\u2019re both working two (or 1.5) jobs. If she leaves, he\u2019s working 4 (or 3) jobs by himself.", "And all the comments that say OP TA? My comment clearly wasn't directed at yours or anyone else who commented that they both need a break.", "Oh I missed that them. But if they\u2019re both in the day care why is wife working from home because of the four month old? I guess maybe health reasons from being pregnant maybe, I\u2019m more confused now.", "You are the one making stuff up. OP works 7 days a week. Wife works 5 days per week, 2 of the 5 are work from home.", "Idk OP never said any of those things about themselves or their spouse. To entertain your statement, of course, parental duties aren't equal. How can they be when OP is working the weekends and their spouse is parenting the kids. Is the income that OP makes with their part-time job not part of parental duties? Same concept of sole breadwinner and SAHP. If income duties aren't evenly spread, then why would you expect \"parental\" duties to be?\n\n\nIf you want kids and then have kids, that includes sacrifices, such as getting up in the middle of the night, preparing kids for daycare, feeding the baby, and changing diapers. Those sacrifices also extend to not leaving your spouse to go on a vacation without your family. OP working extra part-time on the weekends (which OP doesn't want to do but needs to do for income), now has to take PTO from their part-time job that they don't even want to work in the first place so their spouse can take a vacation.", "Tbh, I think this comment is the most correct [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ehr1o/comment/ju7wdnr/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ehr1o/comment/ju7wdnr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nOP's feelings are valid, and his stress and burnout are real, but he's also going about this a bad way. It's also terrible to call your partner something like \"entitled\" for just wanting a break. That's an attack on their character, and a toxic way to communicate your feelings. He can have valid feelings ***and*** be the AH.", "Oh please.\n\nSo, if I were to say, \"I wonder if you're an asshole,\" you would treat that like a simple question?", "Did you hit post too early on accident? Did you have a point to make here?", "Part of \u201cfiguring it out\u201d saying \u201chey I don\u2019t think this [working 60 hour weeks with a commute and also being the sole caretaker for a toddler and an infant] is logistically possible for me to handle by myself, we need to solve this problem before I\u2019m comfortable with you leaving.\u201d", "What kind of stupid take is this? \n\nDont get to say you are overwhelmed by some thingS because you have kids?\n\nI have 2 and a lovely partner, also a depression and i am absolutely overwhelmed by a lot many days and also competely allowed to feel that and voice it, just like OP.\n\nFeelings are not wrong.", "Working from home with an infant-so, twice as hard.", "No, you made up that I said he didn\u2019t work. Just stop.", "I never said anything that OP is wrong for not wanting his wife to leave for a week when kids are that small. \n\nConcept of SAHP and working partner doesn't apply here since OP's wife earns more than he does. So that makes her breadwinner on top of all parenting duties. \nAnd sacrifices should be applied both ways my friend. :)", "> Why is the man always accused of weaponised incompetence", "Feelings aren't wrong, but this is not an excuse for saying you can't parent your kid. It's why people started calling out weaponized incompetence: you had too many halves of couples (sadly, normally dads, tho not always) saying it's too much, I can't do it or worse just doing it wrong cause they've never actually paid attention to what spouse was doing or thought to look up how to do something. While the other half is essentially going \"didn't know either, but I figured it out\".\n\nWhen it's you and the kid, you have to figure it out. The kid can't tell you what to do.  If you constantly rely on partner to tell you, partner is gonna get burned out", "His wife makes more money, but you just chose to leave out the part that he needs to work the part-time job because she spends too much fucking money?", "It is a reasonable comparison, one parent is working while the other is at home with the kids. OP is working the weekends while his wife is not. How can one parent be expected to \"parent\" while they are working? Just as fucked as OP thinking his wife isnt working her actual job while watching their infant. Unless OP wife is going to get a raise or a part-time job herself, then OP part-time job sounds necessary regardless of income gap. \n\nSacrifices goes both ways, hence OP working on the weekends and not seeing their kids while OP wife \"parents\" on the weekends.", "Ok, so\u2026 no? You don\u2019t have a point to make? Is this what people mean when they say reddit is overrun with bots?", "So it is better to avoid real issue about consulting their financial future prospects, i.e. wife's spending habbits and just cutting children off from having their father more present? \nOP's wife was against him getting a part time job. Wasn't that the best time to raise concerns about dividing house expanses according to their income and to better manage her expenses?", "You make it sound like OP is fulfilling his parenting obligations during weekdays instead of his wife.  Yet his profile history is full  of comments about his recently played games. I understand the need to decompress after tiring work day and play for a bit (I am not even certain if those games are f2p) but that shouldn't come off of an expense of your kids or your partner."]}
