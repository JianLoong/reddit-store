{"id": 23579, "submission_id": "15ehr1o", "title": "AITA for not wanting my wife to go on vacation?", "selftext": "An opportunity has arisen for my wife to go to the beach for a week in October with her friend. She asked if I was ok with her going,  to which I originally responded (honestly) that I was not ok with it. \n\nWe have a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Daycare opens at 6:30am, which is also when I need to be at work. So my wife usually drops them off,  and I'll pick them up after work since I get off earlier than she does. She works one full time job,  that has allowed her to work 2 days from home each week because of our infant, and then has weekends off. I work a full time job during the week,  and a part time job on the weekend. (So effectively I have no days off. )\n\nMy wife gets up in the mornings and gets the kids ready,  and usually gets up with the baby at night as well,  as she gets more days off/ at home. Were she to take vacation,  this would of course all fall on me. I could probably manage to be late to work all week without issue,  as long as I stayed later to make up for it. \n\nI told her I was uncomfortable with her leaving for so long. I understand needing a break from the kids,  but there's a difference between me watching them for a day so she can relax and her straight up taking a whole spring break. Not to mention,  she also has a 3 day work trip at the end of this month that will put us in the same scenario. It's a lot for one person, and originally,  I did not want children. Granted,  I love them more than anything now,  but ultimately,  I feel like this is the life she chose for herself and she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled. \n\nShe responded that she's not being entitled because she's just asking me to do what she does every day. She feels like I'm telling her that she can be a mother and nothing else. I don't think this is true,  I think I'm just asking her to be a mother FIRST. I know she does a lot as a mother,  and I appreciate it greatly,  but admittedly I do not feel like I'm capable of doing what she does every day.  I do not get the days off/ home that she does,  and I honestly don't have the patience I should with the infant.\n\nAfter much back and forth,  I begrudgingly told her that she could go and that I would just figure it out, and if I absolutely had to,  I would take PTO from work to make sure the kids are taken care of. She said not to worry about it,  she just won't go. I don't want her to be bitter about it,  because I completely understand needing a vacation,  especially from kids/ family, and have offered alternatives,  like watching them for a weekend so she can do as she pleases,  to which she was not very receptive.  Am I the asshole ?\n\nEdit: people seem to be hung up on the \"this is the life she chose for herself\" part.  I do not say this to say that she deserves more of the burden of parenting. A lot of assumptions suggest that I do not parent while she slaves away.  I feed and bathe and father my kids as well. It is a team effort, but taking over her share while working 60 hours a week is overwhelming af. When i say she chose this for herself, I mean that getting things her way on her own time becomes much less reasonable, and i feel like she refuses to accept this,  or is largely unwilling to compromise when it comes to giving up things she wants.\n\nAnother Edit: I have no problem being a father.  That's not the issue.  In fact, last year before I switched to my current jobs,  there was a good 8 to 10 months where I worked at night,  and kept our toddler during the day to save on daycare costs. It was great.  Who doesn't want to watch Bluey all day?  I CAN do what she does every day.  I CANNOT do what she does AND what I do everyday.", "created_utc": 1690813749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ehr1o/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to_go_on_vacation/", "score": 2020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So she\u2019s on duty 7 days a week.", "I think you have valid reasons for REASONABLE concern, but the way most of the post is phrased is not reasonable. Reasonable concern is trying to work TOGETHER with your wife to figure out childcare on the weekend she\u2019s away (or working to see if she can go from Mon-Fri instead of the weekend too), for example. \n\nThe problem is that you\u2019re very focused on certain factors that make you seem like an AH\u2014stating your wife wanted kids more so she should shoulder the responsibility \u201cshe chose,\u201d stating you don\u2019t know many mothers who\u2019d leave their kids for that long, etc, bringing her work trip into it (when that\u2019s not relevant to this issue especially since that trip is in August?), and stating you\u2019re not patient with your infant. These moments seem to point to a bigger issue\u2014if you\u2019re feeling burnt out as a father or resentful that you have this responsibility you didn\u2019t really want, those are valid feelings to have, but you need to communicate about that.\n\nYou and your wife are in completely different lanes right now and (from your post at least), seemingly not working together at all. What\u2019s your concern with your wife being gone for so long, OP? From your post, it seems like it\u2019s because you can\u2019t handle parenting at the level she does. But you haven\u2019t mentioned any other concerns except for that you\u2019d be late to work (which you\u2019ve said would be fine). I have empathy for you feeling overwhelmed with parenting, but then that reinforces the reason your wife probably needs this vacation in the first place (if we put it this way, she has a full-time job AND a \u201cpart time\u201d job which is parenting after work and on the weekends\u2014I\u2019m not saying that parenting is part time lol but just to illustrate to OP).\n\nAgain, you have every right for reasonable concern and reasonable compromise.

Possibly less actually because you'd take the kids some days.", "Since you are counting your wife's work from home days where she is parenting and working at the same time as days off, I'm going to go with YTA. \n\nYou consider parenting days as days off, so go ahead and take your PTO and parent on your days off.", "INFO: Would you also decline a solo trip for yourself? If the answer is yes, then N A H, I understand both of your points of view. Although you are a bit of an AH for stating that you don\u2019t know other *mothers* that are away for so long. Seems like you would be more understanding for a father to be away. And were both pregnancies unplanned? Because if nit it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you originally wanted children, you chose them anyway. But you seem to use this as an argument for her taking more of the burden which isn\u2019t fair. \n\nWhen do you feel like it would be appropriate for either of you to spend a night away (for leisure not work obviously)? Or what conditions have to be met? You might want to discuss this now or it will keep coming up.\n\nEdit: another question: when was the last time you were away alone over night for a non work related occasion?", "YTA. \nThese are your children, right?

(I *did* read further, but I didn't *have* to.) \n\nThat is some Grade A First Class Shoeshine Bullshit.  She's not just asking you to do what she does every day. She's asking you to do what she does every day ALONG WITH what you already do every day.  60 hour work week plus ALL the child care?  That is not a fair ask by any stretch at all.  \n\nI fully understand that she needs and even deserves a vacation, but you're already doing a week and a half's work every week PLUS the childcare you also do. It would be a lot more fair if you took the kids to visit their grandparents so you could both take a week off, and either spend it together or separately with friends. \n\nYour wife is being selfish.

I get that she probably exhausted with a very young baby and a toddler, but perhaps with a little bit more advanced planning and enlisting some babysitting help it would be doable? \n\nOP, where you're an AH is because you have just kind of rolled over and basically said, 'Nope, I can't do everything she does.\" without ever having tried. It would be difficult, no doubt. But you have an obligation to learn to parent your children on your own should the situation warrant. There are two months in which to find and plan for a sitter or nanny to help you navigate the children while your wife gets some probably badly needed rest. With you doing all that you are, you are probably going to need the same at some point. Your wife needs the rest and a week isn't really too long a request.", "NTA- I could see a night off or a weekend trip but a whole week is a lot to cover. Working 60hrs a week to provide and still helping is a lot, so to add more seems exterior to me.

OP going on vacation for a week while his wife works a full-time job and a part-time job on the weekends. All while having a 3yr and 4mo at home.", "Your wife works 3 days at the office and 2 days  from home while caring for an infant. You work a part time job on the weekends so effectively you have no days off. Effectively neither does your wife unless she has a sitter on the weekend. You initially didn\u2019t want children but ultimately THIS IS THE LIFE YOU CHOSE FOR YOURSELF. Now, the fact that your wife wants a week away from your four month old is concerning. How is her mental health? Did she get enough of a chance to recover from pregnancy and birth before returning to work? I ask this because no way would I have wanted a solid week away from my 4 month old. The first time I took a week away was when my oldest was 10 months old and by day 4 I wanted to come home . Please check in with wife and really listen to her. Please don\u2019t play the \u201cI have it just as bad as you\u201d game with her. You don\u2019t have to deal with the hormonal issues of pregnancy and postpartum. It\u2019s takes 9 months to gestate a baby and I swear just as long to recover physically and emotionally. So ask her if she is ok, and if she is overwhelmed. Please be a compassionate partner who doesn\u2019t blame his wife for struggling, or needing help, or feeling like she needs to get away.

You offered alternatives as you felt a week was too long, but they did not work for her. If you work long hours and do more than one job, your wife needs to at least seek some help from other family members / close friends to help you out in her absence in order to make a week long vacation a viable option.

Also you have 2 kids, this isn't your first rodeo, why are you okay with admitting you wouldn't be able to handle your kids if your wife (goddess forbid) dies or ends up in the hospital? You're their father. Not their uncle. Which means you should be completely capable of handling them on your own. Also would the excuse \"I'm not capable of doing that\" work on your boss? Nope.

Coz if not she still has less free time than you do if you get time off from parenting and work.

You failed. \n \nAnd the reason you think she's entitled is probably because most of the dads you personally know are not actually *good* fathers who can handle their kids on their own. If you can't handle your children for 7 days, thats not a flex. In fact, it's a huge red flag.\nI know several women who can pick up for a week's work trip with a few days notice and leave their babies with their father. Coz you know... He's also their parent, and actually learned how to be one when the babies were born. No one is born with that knowledge, whatever our biological sex. It's learned.

It is a team effort, but taking over her share while working 60 hours a week is overwhelming af. When i say she chose this for herself, I mean that getting things her way on her own time becomes much less reasonable, and i feel like she refuses to accept this, or is largely unwilling to compromise when it comes to giving up things she wants.\n\nIt's a week at the beach dude. \n\nSometimes in order to be the best mother/father you can be you need to go be the best YOU for a while. \n\nShe needs to remember how to be her own person and not just \"Mom\" because that's just one aspect of who she is. \n\nYTA, and kinda a shitty partner in this as well.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t want kids and now you\u2019re saddled with the responsibility.

First of all, if she's working from home and take care of the kids at the same time, she's already doing way more than you are.

It's b*******. Would you expect her to watch the kids if she was in the office? Would you be telling her that it's not a big deal if she was doing it that way? So why is it a big deal if she's doing it at home? She still working, she's still clocked in.\n\nSecond of all, this is the life you both chose.

She asked if I was ok with her going,  to which I originally responded (honestly) that I was not ok with it. \n\nWe have a 3 year old and a 4 month old. Daycare opens at 6:30am, which is also when I need to be at work. So my wife usually drops them off,  and I'll pick them up after work since I get off earlier than she does. She works one full time job,  that has allowed her to work 2 days from home each week because of our infant, and then has weekends off. I work a full time job during the week,  and a part time job on the weekend. (So effectively I have no days off. )\n\nMy wife gets up in the mornings and gets the kids ready,  and usually gets up with the baby at night as well,  as she gets more days off/ at home. Were she to take vacation,  this would of course all fall on me. I could probably manage to be late to work all week without issue,  as long as I stayed later to make up for it. \n\nI told her I was uncomfortable with her leaving for so long. I understand needing a break from the kids,  but there's a difference between me watching them for a day so she can relax and her straight up taking a whole spring break. Not to mention,  she also has a 3 day work trip at the end of this month that will put us in the same scenario. It's a lot for one person, and originally,  I did not want children. Granted,  I love them more than anything now,  but ultimately,  I feel like this is the life she chose for herself and she knew what she was getting herself into. I don't want to deny her the opportunity per se, but I don't know of many mothers who leave for that long by themselves with such a young one at home, and I feel like she's being a little entitled. \n\nShe responded that she's not being entitled because she's just asking me to do what she does every day. She feels like I'm telling her that she can be a mother and nothing else. I don't think this is true,  I think I'm just asking her to be a mother FIRST. I know she does a lot as a mother,  and I appreciate it greatly,  but admittedly I do not feel like I'm capable of doing what she does every day.  I do not get the days off/ home that she does,  and I honestly don't have the patience I should with the infant.\n\nAfter much back and forth,  I begrudgingly told her that she could go and that I would just figure it out, and if I absolutely had to,  I would take PTO from work to make sure the kids are taken care of. She said not to worry about it,  she just won't go. I don't want her to be bitter about it,  because I completely understand needing a vacation,  especially from kids/ family, and have offered alternatives,  like watching them for a weekend so she can do as she pleases,  to which she was not very receptive.

Treat each day as it is new, with a resolve to manage through the challenges in a loving and unified intention. One more piece of advice: once you both get your separate reset, make sure you\u2019re making time for each other. 20 minutes a day, date night after the kids go to bed, just enjoy each other.

She should have brought this up in the context of \"here's an opportunity that has arisen, I'd like to go, can we talk through the logistics and see if it can be made to work.\" And there should be a stated agreement that you will get a similar opportunity in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nIt also sounds like you didn't discuss it much yourself though.

She wants to go, but if she doesn't, she will feel resentful towards either you or the kids. You don't want her to go and leave you on your own like this, and if she does, you'll resent the struggling. Because it WILL be a struggle.

Because they sacrificed and lived a different live when i was reliant on them!", "NTA - Finally someone with some common sense who doesn\u2019t just want to yell op down for not wanting to spend a week working 7 days AND single handed Lu taking care of a baby and a toddler so his wife can go to the beach. And did you see that the poor guy will probably have to take his PTO to cover childcare? How is that fair? This is a classic swap the genders and Reddit would swap the judgement situation. \n\nAlthough I will admit that op didn\u2019t do himself any favors with the \u201cI didn\u2019t even want these kids\u201d part.", "Sad that I had to come so far before seeing an NTA \n\nEvery parenthood AITA that has a dad upset for watching his kids on top of working every day is soo biased. \n\nShe's allowed a break. But he is too. I'm assuming out of work hrs they share parent duties 50/50", "Maybe you should've read the entire post to make an informed decision. He isn't being asked to \"do what she does everyday\" he's being asked to work two jobs (60hrs) AND do the work of two parents. I understand she is a human and a person first but she CHOSE to have children and that means SACRIFICING. Like you said they BOTH chose to have kids so why does she get a break when he doesn't. (I would say the same if the genders were reversed) If he had the same work load as she did and she wanted to take off and he said no i'd be on the same boat as you BUT it's not fair to ask someone who is already working more than you to also do childcare. Jesus this man is trying to do his best but he can't do it all. Show some compassion. Also what does your comment \"be a man\" have anything to do with? He is being a man by not only helping with the kids with the little free time he has but also working 60hrs a week (2 Jobs).", "So she can do what she always do AND work his 60 hours each week?\n\nlet's look it at the other way... how can he work 60 hours each week away from home and do all that she is doing?\n\nIt's just math. He need to take a break from work, but they also lack money... so he's working weekends.\n\nNo she don't have the luxury to take this break, better to save money so he can stop working on weekends....", "They probably from UsA or something... don't have the luxury.", "Dosnt change the fact that he cant be at work while doing ALL she is also doing...\nHe can't be a two places at once", "Yep and she handles nighttime care and weekends. She\u2019s basically always on the job.", "Exactly! Lot of shit talking about men today on this app.", "Oh and YTA", "This so much. Dad's aren't allowed to have breaks from kids in this day and age.", "That was my thought too. I would hate being away from my nearly 1 year old that long... what if she thought I had abandoned her? \n\nI also live in a situation where we are often ships passing in the night, I couldn't just up and leave for a week, how would I even relax knowing how much stress my other half would be under?", "Ffs! So, he basically needs to use his vacation time just to be able to care for them all week. Or maybe he can just do half days? I also feel like this is a big ask from the wife. Apparently they are scraping if they both work and he has two jobs, so the PTO he would need to use just to keep up is critical. Kids under two need a LOT of attention.", "Same here. The \u201cbut you were the one who wanted kids\u201d is an AH rhetoric, but parents generally don\u2019t get week-long beach vacations without their family when the kids are that young. OP has a full-time job and works on weekends, plus he\u2019s only not doing the morning drop-offs because of his work schedule. Both of their plates are full right now, and she doesn\u2019t get to just drop everything for a week when her husband has no days off ever.", "And unfortunately, comments stating these facts dont get seen enough.\n\nPreach on!", "He suggested a weekend. That is a reasonable compromise.", "You expect people on this sub to keep reading once a man can be blamed for something?", "And he can get up at night with the kid as well. To make it even", "Truth. However, his attitude towards her like she should be shackled to the kids without time away because \"this is the life she chose for herself\"....I guarantee he lost any chance of success as soon as that thought formed in his brain. Also- him even mentioning that he did not initially want to have kids just tells you where his head is at. You don't have kids and then refuse to make sacrifices when one of you needs time to feel like a human again. It's not always easy but you do what you have to.", "She earns more than him so your argument about working 3 jobs falls flat.", "His wife is also working 7 days a week. \n\nShe full time solo parents 4 days a week and also holds a full time job. The break she gets from solo parenting is through daycare, not her partner. She isn't getting a break under this set up either and it's gross the number of people who say he's the only one taxed beyond their limit.\n\nShe's fucking tired and needs a break too.", "And I am sometimes hesitant to point this out because people get really upset, but many many studies have shown, especially since the pandemic, that men often think they are doing more in the home and with the kids than they actually are and it rarely equals what a working mom does. I'm not necessarily saying that OP is the AH, but I don't think the mom is either. It might not be logistically possible, and I understand that, but I am always skeptical when men and fathers say they are doing an equal amount. I'll believe it when I see it.", "Right? So, what's the conclusion regarding the situation based on your observation?", "Reddit Hates men.", "Yeah holy shit having to work my job at home while also having a whole-ass infant to take care of sounds like a literal nightmare.", "Reddit is just r/femaledatingstrategy in disguise.\n\nIt's actually gotten worse in recent years.", "If he were a woman, everyone would be like \"ohhh boo boo, you're right in everything you do.\"\n\nThat first comment is an asshole.\n\nHa, how you like them apples.\n\nWife's entitled. Get @ me.", "Yep, when my kids were similar ages (they're closer), I would have been pissed if my husband wanted to take a week guy's trip.", "It amazes me that 4.6k people up voted the comment I responded to.", "He suggested she go away for a weekend. That seems like an excellent compromise.", "You did see that she\u2019s taking a work trip at the end of this month right? I wonder when this poor guy\u2019s last day off from work was. Granted taking care of kids is also work but still, it\u2019s atleast rewarding and often fun.", "Partners do stuff like this for each other when the kids are a bit older, sure, but taking a WEEK vacation when you have two kids and one is just over 6 months? I\u2019ve never heard of it. Our first year with two kids was an \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation. We maybe each took a night here and there. Asking to be able to take a week during that year. is just crazy to me. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not someone who believes you shouldn\u2019t travel without your kids-took a lovely king trip without the kids this summer. But leave an infant for that long? No way!", "If he\u2019s doing a job where people\u2019s lives are on the line then it is even, and he really shouldn\u2019t wake up at all", "Agreed", "She out earns him and asked him not to work weekends. So this is not a situation of her choosing.", "What they should do is save money... \nSo he can stop working weekends and get each some childfree days both.\n\nNot waste the money on vacation when they need a better daily life.\n\nHis attitude can be built up from stress, he says he love his children and should stop working so much.", "They both need a break. However her needing a break does not mean taking a week long vacation, leaving 1 person working 2 jobs, 7 days a week, while also managing 3 children, 2 of which being incredibly young. I don't see it being possible for either of them to take a long vacation without heavily burdening their partner. They'd either have to get some major help for babysitting (which based on them working 3 jobs the cost of that might be out of their budget) or take a shorter vacation. \nHe's an asshole for his wording and not understanding his wife is also tired. His wife is however also in the wrong, because it's simply unrealistic to believe someone should work 60 hours 7 days a week, while also having to somehow manage 3 kids. (One of which is an infant that stays home with mom. So how would he take care of that kid anyways?)", "Exactly. Everyone gets so hung up on certain parts. But he tried to offer her a weekend. He just said he couldn\u2019t handle a whole week on his own with his full time job. A week is being selfish with kids that age.", "I wasn\u2019t offering one, was just replying to the token \u201cmIsAnDrY\u201d dude who was claiming we didn\u2019t notice (because sexism or something) that OP works a lot. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the right answer is here re the wife taking time off. Both are working lots without a break, but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP is working any harder than his wife\u2026. At least OP gets a full nights sleep every night. Sounds like wife really needs the break, so she should get one. But then OP gets an equal break too at a different time? \n\nOP isn\u2019t helping himself here by acting like he has no idea how to parent the baby and like he generally doesn\u2019t want to be a dad. Hard to garner sympathy with an attitude like that.", "I mean, have you ever worked 7 days/week non-stop for a very long period of time?\n\nIt fucks with you.  Dude\u2019s burning out.  He\u2019s spinning in a wheel that doesn\u2019t stop.\n\nI had a month, just one month, where I was putting in 60-80 hours/week and I still had at least one down-ish day/week to attempt to relax and zero little screaming kids to contend with.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t the most pleasant to be around by the end of the month - pulled it together but I was definitely often a bit short with my partner who is a saint and just shrugged his shoulders knowing it would improve once I was back on my normal schedule.\n\nBut the normal schedule never comes for OP.  I\u2019m giving him some grace for how he wrote it, the base points are he\u2019s at the end of the day doing his absolute best to be a good father and husband, he\u2019s just spread thinner than thin.", "Agreed. A lot of people hung up on his wording.  It is a lot for one person for a week.", "This seems a bit disingenuous as the sentence is talking about her paid work situation, so it would be fair to read it as \"she gets two days off {work}\". It's important to recognise that women's unpaid labour is labour, but it seems like he wanted to say that she doesn't work her paid job two days a week, and didn't seem to be devaluing the care tasks that she is responsible for.", "Where I live, an infant cannot be in care more than 8 hours a day max.", "Yeah, agreed, and I\u2019m sorry - asking him to blow his PTO to take care of the kids so she can be a \u201csorority chick on spring break\u201d when he works seven days a week?  Horrible take.\n\nAll the YTA people seem to be ignoring the fact he did offer her a compromise of a weekend to do whatever she wants which presumably means he\u2019d still potentially be sacrificing PTO for HER to have time off because he works seven days a week.\n\nHe\u2019s changed his whole job schedule and taken another one to support his family.  When we thought we were going to have a baby last year my partner said he was thinking of going back to corporate work so I could be a SAHM and I looked at him and said, \u201care you fucking insane?\u201d\n\nSurprise, kids are hella work and often require a decent amount of sacrifice from both parties.", "I was so glad to see someone say that. Being impatient with infants while working 2 jobs and being told to do it alone a week is high risk.\n\nToo often parents are discouraged from expressing how close to the edge they are mentally. \n\nIt's important for parents to express this feeling (in words)."]}
