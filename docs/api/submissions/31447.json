So as I mentioned, we have been together for almost 8 years! Bit of a backstory on our relationship there, now onto my step sister!\n\nSo my dad cheated on my mom from what my understanding was from when I was 12 to when I were 15. This got out the summer I was 15, my dad and mom broke up (never married), he moved in with his affair partner who had a daughter the same age as me. I have never liked my step mom, mostly because she knew about my parents relationship and I have not liked my dad since either. However, I have tried to be nice to them all, including his daughter. She have never been nice to me, for some examples \n1, when my fianc\u00e9 and I had been dating for almost 6 months, she began messaging him, sending pics of herself in underwear, tried to get him to think I was cheating on him etc. \n2, When I broke my leg when I was 17 she stopped my father from visiting me in the hospital because it was her birthday week and he should not put me before such a special time for her\n3, She has talked extremely bad about my mom, using slurs (my mom is half black) and telling me that her mom was the obvious choice.\n\nSo when we sent out our invites, me and my fianc\u00e9 decided not to include her. This set my dad off as he thinks this all should have been put in the past a long time ago, he thinks that I am being petty and still resenting her for \u201cjust being a normal teenager\u201d. We had a big argument where he told me that if she can\u2019t come, he and his wife wouldn\u2019t either. \n\nShe also sent me a long long text telling me she was extremely sorry for how she behaved when we were younger, that she has been in therapy and has tried to become a better person ever since and that she would love to see her only sister get married. After this text I was starting to regret my decision, we have not seen each other for almost two years as she moved but maybe she is right and this can be a great opportunity to maybe even get to know her better.\n\nI feel like I am an asshole for not inviting her because then I am subconsciously thinking that people can never change and become better. Also because she did all this stuff many years ago, and I still punish her for it many years later.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700594557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180p0n9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepsister_at_my_wedding/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You say she acted this way many years ago and now she says she's changed, but in the time since then has she made any effort to make amends for her behavior?  The context of your post would indicate the answer is no and that the only reason she's now reaching out to you at all is because she's being compelled to.  If she couldn't put in the effort to apologize before being reminded that you exist, then fuck her.", "NTA, I\u2019d let him know you were fine with him not being there. \n\n\u201cSorry to hear you don\u2019t want to come. I understand that no matter what I say you won\u2019t change your mind because you have the same selfish attitude as her. \n\n I don\u2019t want someone as could as her who tried to break up my relationship there for the ceremony that we commit our lives to each other. \n\nYou may not understand that sentiment because you haven\u2019t made such a commitment yourself and have no problem betraying a partner and abandoning your child but I assure you most people in my position wouldn\u2019t want her or your affair partner at their wedding.\u201d", "NTA, this is your wedding and you want to be surrounded by the people who love and care for you.  Your stepsister didn't, your stepmom didn't and your dad wants you to extend an olive branch for your wedding to them.  This should have happened years ago but he chose to ignore their crap behavior.\n\nAs this isn't how it works, you can tell him since your special day means nothing to him as he is your dad except to force you to include people who treated you badly that he won't be attending either as he put them before his own biological daughter.  \n\nFollowed by because I'm petty, he isn't paying for your wedding he doesn't get a say in it.  Along with not walking you down the aisle as you aren't a priority in his life.  He can reserve that for his spoiled step daughter.", "NTA, a wedding is hardly the place for dealing with something this emotionally charged. If she really wants to reconnect and show you that she is different from when you knew her, she can choose to do it another time. If this is the hill your father is willing to die on, let him. He's the one that will have missed out on seeing his only blood daughter get married.", "NTA.  You get to invite or not invite whoever you want.  \n\nBut if you think she might have changed it wouldn't hurt to get together with her and find out.  \n\nYour dad, however, I would not invite.

Her racism towards your mother is enough to keep her away.\n\nPeople don't change quickly. If she's sincerely changing and trying to be better, I'm happy for her and she hasn't earned your trust.

Your rules. \n\nOnly YOU can decide whether or not to give her a second chance. But that has to be your decision and not one made out of guilt. \n\nYour dad is an Arsehole for putting her first again.

Just know that this time I will not forgive you for putting your new family before me. I have forgiven you many times in the past and allowed you to continue being in my life. I forgave you when you cheated on my Mother, I forgave you when you didn\u2019t come see me in the hospital because it was my stepsisters \u201cbirthday week\u201d (which is ridiculous.) If you miss my wedding, it will be the last time you hurt me. You will never meet any children I might have, you will not be made apart of any milestones or achievements I may make.

It\u2019s great that she gave an apology but I question the timing of it. Did she really change?\n\nMaybe write back and say you appreciate it but there are some bad memories associated with her that make you hesitant. Could you maybe go get coffee or dinner with her and see how you feel? Either the mask will slip, or she\u2019ll turn out to have actually done some soul searching.", ">After this text I was starting to regret my decision\n\nThis is a question for yourself, not for this sub.  No decision has to be definite and if you're having doubts, best way to deal with them is to clear the air.\n\nThe only onus on this decision is what you want to see happen, not what someone else does.  Ultimately, you're going to have to live with this although I do think your Dad is an massive AH for threatening to withdraw his attendance.\n\nSo between you and your Dad, NTA.  IF there's a chance for reconcilliation, his behaviour is not helping things.\n\nNo judgement for you and your step-sister because it's not only not current, but who you both were at 17 is vastly different to who you both are at 22.  You've got 3-4 months, follow your heart on this one.", "oof this is a hard one. personally it all depends on who is paying for this shindig.

She doesn't want your dad to give you an ounce of attention (a birthday week? Special time for her? Seriously...).\n\nYou're looking at it from your POV only though. Your fiance also doesn't want her there. She sent him unwanted pics (doesn't matter how long ago), tried to make him believe you were cheating... I wouldn't want her their either. \n\nAs a former teenager, her behaviour wasn't normal. It was jealous, racist and targeted. Dad doesn't get to rug sweep all that just so you can pretend to be a happy family.", "No, NTA. There\u2019s no guarantee that she truly has improved and I\u2019d be kind of skeptical that this apology is coming right after you decided who not to invite. Enjoy your wedding, and if you decide you want to give her a chance afterward then that\u2019s up to you.", "Everyone has been mentioning the actions of the sister as a teen and if she has changed or not. I agree if she has changed she would have reached out before this.\n\nI am more concerned about the father who let a teenager say racist things and harass his daughter without standing up for her. I would think if he did she would have mentioned it. \n\nSo my read on this is your dad now has his daughter that is same race as him, and is low key racist about you. \n\nHe is the type of guy that agrees with the racist crap going on these days while telling certain people that of course he isn't racist he has a mixed race child and mixed race ex. All while ignoring the fact he treats his current partner and her child better.\n\nYou don't have a step sister problem, you have a father problem.  He is just hoping the bad blood between you two is enough to allow him to justify not showing up and supporting you like a good father would.", "INFO: How young was she when all these bad events happened and has her behavior changed since? \n\nI'm willing to extend some tolerance to kids who are acting out due to their parents' (and she was part of this mess too) if the actions are in the past, in their childhood and they've changed since but it has to be pretty clear that she's a different person now.", "I'd say NTA, but you do have a little time if you want to try and get together with her for a coffee or something low key, and see if she really has changed. I guess it depends on whether you want to maintain a relationship with your father, it doesn't sound to me like you necessarily do. He definitely handled this badly, an ultimatum is rarely the best option to start with. Either way, it is your day, and congratulations, just in case your own father never says it to you!", "YTA\n\nMy racist, bully stepsister is not invited to my wedding is very on trend for fake posts.", "NAH\n\nYou could text her back and ask if she knows how she treated you and is truly sorry, why hasn't she reached out without a wedding invitation as a carrot?\n\nOP, you can invite her and hope she is being honest.  You can invite her with warnings that you will have her bounced if she is less than courteous to anyone there.  You can not invite her and accept that you may get married without your dad there.  \n\nIf inviting her is your only chance for her to make amends, it doesn't sound like real regret to me. \n\nI guess the real question is how much are you willing to bend to ensure your dad is there?\n\nEdited to add:  It is your dad that is the asshole.  But he always has been, hasn't he?", "Tough call. She sounds pretty awful.  \n\nDo you trust her now?  \n\nHow important is your dad being there to you?\n\nI had a disaster step mother incident at my own wedding and it still hurts 35 years later.\n\nI would have done better without dad and wife in hindsight....but that is me.\n\nMy sympathy..... so upsetting when dad puts second family first. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA for inviting your dad in the first place.", "I mean it sounds like she\u2019s acknowledging her mistakes and trying to apologize.   I think One relationship with your father I\u2019d suggest inviting your stepsister.  It\u2019s not her fault that she\u2019s an affair baby.

You don\u2019t have that close of a relationship now, so I don\u2019t see the need for it. \n\nAnd you can tell your dad that you were gracious to let him bring his wife. But if he refuses to come that will be on him.", "How long was she sending your fianc\u00e9 texts with inappropriate pics and trying to sabotage your relationship? Doesn\u2019t sound like she was a teenager. NTA. She\u2019s manipulative and your dad has always fell for it. If she feels so bad why hasn\u2019t SHE reached out. Sorry sis, seems like more of the same. \n\nIf I were you I would write your father a letter going through everything and how hurtful it\u2019s been and how he is yet again choosing her. If he chooses her on your wedding that\u2019s his choice but you won\u2019t forget it this time.", "I'd also add that a wedding isn't really the place to make amends. Maybe a luncheon at a cafe would be neutral territory and she could build up to an invite but you don't just text someone out of the blue and say \"sorry.. would like to go to ur wedding\".", "As the saying goes,  a tiger doesn't change its stripes.  A person like that is jealous and spiteful and would attempt to ruin the wedding. NTA", "they haven't talked in 2 years..that's plenty of time to say \"I'm sorry\".\n\nYet, she's only apologising now because there are consequences.\n\nLow consequences...but it's still shitty for her to reach out now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I'm suprised OP wants dad there.", "And you don't have to decide right now.  Meet her for lunch and talk for a while.  That'll give you an idea of what type of person she's grown into.", "She would absolutely ruin the day or spill red wine on OPs dress. I wouldn't give her the chance. She has to start from the bottom. Meet for coffee first and rebuild trust. OP has no reason to trust her now.", "High school they are about the same age, she had a \"birthday week\" and her dad wasn't allowed to visit her at the hospital when she broke her leg.", "People grow up. They mature. She is 22 and we are only given things she did when 15-17.   \nThe OP could meet with her for a decent enough time to see how she really is now without committing to anything.", "So several years ago when she was a teen?\n\nIn that case I would kinda go with a soft YTA.  It's your wedding and you're allowed to choose your guests but it's weird to me that you invited your dad but not her.  He (and her mom) were the adults who caused this mess.  If anyone should be uninvited it's them, but you chose to not invite her based on something she did as a teen.\n\nThat is, you're willing to forgive them for being adults and making a colossal mistake that impacted you and her, but you're unwilling to forgive her for being an idiot teenager acting out as idiot teenagers do.  That seems odd and hence my judgement."]}
