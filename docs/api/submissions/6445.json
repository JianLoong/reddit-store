Our daughter only speaks French, I didn't teach her English because it would've been difficult teaching her, especially when everyone around her speaks French and me and my husband speak French to each other. I didn't think this was a problem since we live in France and if she wants to learn English she can when she goes to school.\n\nWe (me, husband, daughter) went to Australia for Christmas and new years, this is the first time my daughter has been to Australia or met my family. When we were there multiple family members were surprised and annoyed by the fact my daughter didn't speak english and couldn't speak to them. My Mum even had a conversation with me about it and told me my daughter wouldn't get anywhere in life without learning english (silly because she literally lives in France surrounded by French speakers, and she'll learn English in school anyway), said it was bad she couldn't communicate with her family and even compared it to child abuse (!). I wouldn't have thought it was that controversial to only teach French to a child who lives in France.\n\nMost of my family are still upset with me and say I'm \"depriving\" her of English and that she needs to learn it, but my husband says it's reasonable for a child in France to only speak French and that trying to make her learn English will confuse her.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672815527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102wpkd/aita_for_not_teaching_my_daughter_english/", "score": 2381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my family we lost the ability to speak German like natives when my grandparents (German speakers from birth, despite being second-generation Americans) decided not to pass it on to their children.  Though this does not necessarily apply to native polyglots, English instruction in school will likely prove a poor substitute since she will have lost a significant amount of brain plasticity by the time she can access it.\n\nWhile I wouldn't have pressed the arguments for English in the same terms as the family in Australia--I feel those tactics tend to encourage people to dig in rather than reconsider their approach--they are not wrong that it has a larger speaker base than French, by a factor of about four for both first- and second-language speakers.  And having a native speaker in the family is a huge asset for language acquisition.", "You\u2019re not necessarily TA, but it would be a good idea for you to go ahead and start teaching her some English.

I am a gardener and had customers who couldn't speak my language because they just recently got here or were just visiting for a funeral. If I wasn't able to speak English I just couldn't have talked to them or helped them, A LOT of jobs require at least a basic understanding of English so it's definitely smart to start sooner than later.\n\nAlso you make it seem like you are just too lazy to put in effort because it \"would be difficult\" and that doesn't really help your case imo", "YTA do you know how much harder it is to learn a language as you get older?", "Bonjour, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise bilingue ici!

I swear I had to learn it by myself AFTER I finished up with high school. The way it is teached here is horrible, not fun and not practical. It is teached the way I learned Latin : like a dead language. We learn things we will never use again, we lack vocabulary and cultural clues, dialogue and tools to be understood. Most of the things we learn aren't about daily life, or hobbies and activities we have. We can't say a thing about who we are besides our hair color and age.\n\n \nWe couldn't use whatever meant \"periphrases\" (giving the definition of a word or a description of it if you forgot it or didn't know it ? I think it's that) even if it's really useful in conversations to be understood, we had to guess some meanings from reading a text over and over, conjugation is SH*T, grammar ? We had to guess some too because you'd be expected to have understood something that was never said or written, right ?\nMost people internalize stress and shame so much here from English classes, that during my high school finals I remember how many people fainted just to pass the big oral : 7 on 35. That's a lot. One is already too much.\n\nYou're taking away so much from your daughter, relying on a system that is not meant for her to success in this class. Especially when most public schools only have one or two hours a week in English, if you're lucky. Countryside ? You can wait middle school or high school to get a better luck.

But you do you with your parenting. In the end it's your choice. But also I'm not sure about France but in America we don't get the chance to learn another language in school until about 11-12 years old in middle school.

Do you not want your daughter to be able to communicate with your own family? Why?", "YTA. She\u2019s going to be pretty pissed with you when she is older. You are valuing your own comfort instead of giving her a leg up in life, both job opportunities and fluency to live in an English speaking culture like Australia. She will want to visit there. It would cost you nothing to speak English to her. Learning in school is different than having native level fluency from childhood.", "YTA, but I don\u2019t think out of malice and also the stuff your family said about child abuse is ridiculous. The one point they do have, is that not having a common language makes building meaningful relationships really hard. You may not intend for it but she\u2019ll never be close to your side of the family if they can\u2019t communicate, and it\u2019s reasonable for close relatives to be concerned they may struggle to know their grandchild/niece/cousin. If you don\u2019t like your family and don\u2019t want her to build a meaningful relationship with them then that\u2019s your prerogative I guess? \n\nHowever, kids are sponges for language in their early years and being raised bilingual has been shown to have a lot of benefits academically, even outside of just knowing two languages. Also English language instruction in school isn\u2019t anywhere near enough to learn a language (and honestly French resistance to learning or speaking any other language is a bit parochial) there has to be some level of immersion - spoken to at least a bit outside of class, watching tv, reading\u2026 all of which you could provide for your child with just a little effort which would set her up well for her academic future and maybe even career - with an Australian mother, I imagine she has dual citizenship through you? Think of the opportunities she could have in her future to live and work in Aus as well as France, and to communicate easily with many people around the world? Intentionally making the choice not to give your daughter a strong grounding in a second language, even if she\u2019s never fully bilingual is intentionally hampering her future.

Our daughter only speaks French, I didn't teach her English because it would've been difficult teaching her, especially when everyone around her speaks French and me and my husband speak French to each other. I didn't think this was a problem since we live in France and if she wants to learn English she can when she goes to school.\n\nWe (me, husband, daughter) went to Australia for Christmas and new years, this is the first time my daughter has been to Australia or met my family. When we were there multiple family members were surprised and annoyed by the fact my daughter didn't speak english and couldn't speak to them. My Mum even had a conversation with me about it and told me my daughter wouldn't get anywhere in life without learning english (silly because she literally lives in France surrounded by French speakers, and she'll learn English in school anyway), said it was bad she couldn't communicate with her family and even compared it to child abuse (!). I wouldn't have thought it was that controversial to only teach French to a child who lives in France.\n\nMost of my family are still upset with me and say I'm \"depriving\" her of English and that she needs to learn it, but my husband says it's reasonable for a child in France to only speak French and that trying to make her learn English will confuse her.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It would be nice if she could understand your family\n\nAlso like others said, learning young is better and easier. I didn\u2019t start to really learn until I went to school and my Spanish is very limited and I bet would\u2019ve been better if I started at home at a young age. I think it would be best if you began speaking some English to her, it\u2019ll only give her a leg up in school when she learns. \n\nIt\u2019s very common in the US for bilingual parents to teach their kids two languages by both parents communicating with the child in different languages and it\u2019s pretty successful and not very confusing for the child despite what it may seem.", "I would kill just to have my grandma teach me Spanish as I was growing up, I feel very left out when my friends have conversations in Spanish, and it especially pisses me off since my other grandmother said to only speak Spanish around me so I'd be bilingual, so yes YTA", "YTA. English isn't that difficult to learn and you could at least teach her the basics. I just don't understand why you'd be so against teaching her.

Funny enough my situation is the complete reverse of yours. I am French living in England, my husband is English and my 3 kids (now 17,15 and 13) were born in England and Only speak English (although they are learning French at school). The difference is that I could not not teach French to my oldest because he has special needs and I needed to concentrate on English. When my second came along he had a speech impairment caused by auditory dyslexia, so again had to concentrate on English. When my 3rd came, we'll they was just no points. My family don't speak English so I found it very hard to bound with my kids. Now, my eldest can speak French at all, my middle one is learning French like an English kids (but he wants to learn), and my youngest is learning it at school but not interested. You would think that they would come to be and ask me to help them learn French? But no, I am mum, so may ask a question about homework that is all. Looking back I wish they had learn French at a much younger age, it would be one less homework to do for them if anything else. It would also mean that they would feel more confident in France. I would say buy her some book, put some English subtitles cartoons on... It does not have to be heavy learning you could do it as a game, match the words...

Your kid could be naturally bilingual. I live in the US. My BFF only speaks English. Her husband is a native Spanish speaker who is also fluent in English. They speak English to each other. IOW, her husband is in your position. But they decided they wanted their kids to be truly bilingual, so from the time they were born, her husband has only spoken Spanish to them. When the kids were small, they had children\u2019s books in both Spanish and English. The result is that they have 3 bilingual kids who can speak to and understand their Spanish speaking relatives. You wouldn\u2019t have had to \u201dteach\u201d your daughter English, she would learned English the same way she learned French.

No idea why you never read about bilingualism and stole this experience from your kid.", "YTA. It is going to be much easier for her to learn English (or any second language) while she is young than to try to learn it later.

Being fluently bi-/multi- lingual will be an asset to her throughout her life.\n\nAlso want to add that the greatest amount of brain development occurs in the first 5 years of life, which is why it so much easier for younger kids to learn languages while those \"pathways\" are still being developed and growing.", ">\ttrying to make her learn English will confuse her.\n\nNo it obviously won't.

Regardless of living in France, English is an important language internationally and unless she lives in a bubble she will very likely need or want English in her life. \n\nMy husband had a mother who thought similarly to you and chose to not teach him her native language (a Chinese dialect) and it honestly damaged their relationship long term. He feels like she made the wrong choice and resented it.", "YTA - you had the opportunity to raise a bilingual child which would hugely advantage her in the long run and chose not to because you couldn\u2019t be bothered.

I\u2019m very lucky that I live in a English speaking majority province and not in the capital or else I\u2019d be screwed. Now I have to teach myself with my own money and time when the easiest time to learn French is when you are learning to talk if I\u2019m not mistaken. HUGE YTA.", "Soft YTA\n\nAustralian here (currently living in Canada, but had both kids in Switzerland). When our kids were born (French part of Switzerland) we agreed they\u2019d become bilingual asap. We both speak English, so it was agreed we\u2019d speak to them in English at home, and they would learn French at school (us speaking to them in our crappy French would have harmed their progress as we aren\u2019t very good at it, having not learned it when we were young). Before long, our oldest (age 2) was learning both.\n\nWhen we moved to Canada (English part), they were only 1 and 2 years old, so unfortunately didn\u2019t have long to learn any language by that point. So we put them into French immersion school. My in laws (Australian) couldn\u2019t understand why we would insist on our kids doing all of their schooling in French when they didn\u2019t need to, but we argued that learning languages is best done when the children are as young as possible. Our friends in Switzerland all had perfectly bilingual kids (in some cases, their mom spoke to them only in English while their dad spoke to them only in French etc, depending on who was from which country). When these kids spoke, you couldn\u2019t tell whether French was their first language or English, as they learned them from native speakers from birth! I was totally envious.\n\nToday, our kids are adults and both are fluent in French and English and are doing university in English. Their French isn\u2019t as good as it would have been if they had a native speaker at home, just like your child will never be as good at English if they learn it from a teacher at school instead of being immersed in it. \n\nAnd the reality is that most people throughout the world do not speak French, but in the majority of countries - if you don\u2019t speak the native language, it is easy to find an English speaker to translate. So you are definitely holding her back. \n\nAnd if you want her to have a good relationship with her relatives (ours do thanks to FaceTime and visits) then she will need to be fluent in English, otherwise she will always be an outsider. \n\nThe good news - it isn\u2019t too late. You just need to decide, from this moment on, to ONLY speak to her in English, and let your husband only speak in French. She will resist at first, but then will soon be happily babbling to you in both languages.", "YTA. \n\n>I didn't teach her English because it would've been difficult teaching her\n\nAbsolutely not. The younger you can start teaching a child a new language, the easier it is. You have isolated her from being able to communicate with the rest of her family", "Shes 4. NTA", "YTA, It is easy for kids to pick up more than one language and all you had to do is speaking your native language with the child. It is fine you speak french with your husband and to french people but you could have easily made your kid bilingual by the age of 4.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s extremely well known that the younger a child is, the easier it is for them to pick up a language. I have many friends with half English/half Greek children and they switch with ease. Simply from their parent speaking to them in their native language.\n\nIt\u2019s also known that a bilingual child will pick up other languages easier than a child who doesn\u2019t learn a second one until later in life, even teenage years.\n\nYou\u2019ve done your daughter no favours at all.", "YTA big time.    \n\nFirst of, you\u2019re depriving by our child from the opportunity of gaining more than one language with little to no efforts on yours or her part. All you need to do is speak to her in English and read books together. In this day and age, it is SUPER easy to get English books shipped to francs. And much cheaper than getting French books shipped to Australia for instance.    \nSecond, you\u2019re putting a lot of faith in the French school system when it comes to languages. The focus is passing exams. Exams are mostly about written language. Very few involve speaking\u2026 until you hit post secondary level, at which point students have got a lot less time to focus on improving their speaking skills.    \nThirdly, you\u2019re cutting her off from her Australian family and heritage. That\u2019s silly AND hurtful to your side of the family. Believe it or not, they miss you. And you not speaking English to your daughter sends the message that you\u2019ve mostly written them off.     \nFourth, you don\u2019t know what may come in the future. A lot of Half French families have been coming to Australia for various reasons in the past few years and spots in french schools are rare. So, who knows, one day you might decide you need to come and live in Australia and what\u2026 your kids don\u2019t speak English? That\u2019s tough on them.     \nFive, you live in Europe and you truly think she won need English? Or that school will do the trick? Also, did you think ahead at all when she comes home and is all excited about learning English but is also too self conscious to speaking with you because of her undeniable French accent? Or when she finds it difficult to learn and is resentful you never spoke English to her?     \nSixth, the confusion you talk about is short lived and not detrimental at all. My friend\u2019s kids says \u201cmes chaussettes sont wet\u201d. We all think it\u2019s cute, and it\u2019s the same as a French kid using \u201cmon mien\u201d for a few months before switching to the appropriate grammar. Nobody bats an eye and everyone one understands it\u2019s part of the universal process of learning learning as a child.    \n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s the same as providing good nutrition, sun protection and enough sleep, or promoting literacy by reading books together daily. It\u2019s the same kind of care you are putting into her health, well-being and wealth in the future.        \n\nI mean\u2026 do you not put sunscreen, a hat and rashie on her when in Australia because \u201cwe live in France, so, she won\u2019t get skin cancer\u201d ? It\u2019s the same !!!! You haven\u2019t been speaking to her in English because you live in France.      \n\nWhat I think this all is is,.. you\u2019re pretty proud of yourself for having learnt French and using it in your daily life. And you should be boys a hard language to learn and master and sound good in. It requires work and attention to detail. Well done. So, you want to use it.     \nAre you afraid, maybe, that speaking English to her will make you sound less French? Will revive your Anglo accent? Because it may. Sure. But is that more important than easily imparting on your daughter some skills and knowledge which she would have to work so hard for otherwise? It\u2019s needlessly \u2026 cruel in my opinion. And it reminds me of the generation of immigrant kids in Australia who can\u2019t speak mandarin, Cantonese, Italian or Greek because teachers back then used to say \u201cit\u2019ll slow them down at school\u201d so parents spoke to them in broken English. Well, now those parents are grandparents and regret it dearly and let me tell you, they try and make amends by speaking their native language to their grandchildren. Too little too late.     \n\nIt\u2019s not too late for you and your daughter. Use this trip as your opportunity to start speaking English exclusively with her. Come home to France and speak English for everything but homework. She is likely to respond in French for a while but at least she\u2019ll understand. That\u2019s half the battle.    \nPlease please please, speak English to her!", "YTA. A cursory Google search would have shown you that there are huge benefits for language learning later in life if you learn early. The obvious thing would have been for you to speak to her in English and your husband in English. It's kind of mind boggling that you would waste this opportunity for your kid to be multi lingual.", "YTA\n\nYou are going against every recommendation for bilingual families. First of all, it is recommended that parents speak to their children in the language they are most comfortable, also emotionally. That would be your mothertongue in your case. You spoke adult French wehen pregnant, but you did not know baby- and children French: pet names, nursery rhymes, lullabies and so on. Also, most polyglots experience that they feel different speaking different languages. French you is not English you. Why on earth did you feel like talking to your very own baby in what is to you a foreign language, was a good idea?\n\nSecondly, you are actively keeping your child from having a relationship with her grandparents and other maternal family. You do not need to be on the same continent nowadays. If your child spoke English, your family could have had video chats with her. They could read stories to her and have longer talks the older she gets. She will never be as close to them now as she could have been because she will be a teenager by the time she can converse in English. This will hurt your parents very, very much, and only become more hurtful as years go by.\n\nThirdly, you could have made your daughter bilingual with zero effort. People do not teach their children a language, they just use the language with them and around them. Millions of children have picked up two or three languages this way. Their comprehension of the second language is usually very good, even if they do speak flently themselves. Instead you reduced English to a foreign language learned in school, and let's face it: France is not among the European countries known for producing excellent English skills.\n\nThis was a dumb decision.  \n\n\nEdit: In case you want to fix this: She is still young. Kids her age can pick up a language by just hearing it still. You can put her in an English speaking daycare and/or have someone from your family come and spend a lot of time with you. Then slowly introduce you talking English to her as well.", "YTA. My wife is Swiss but my 3 kids were born in the US and we spoke only English at home. We ended up moving to Switzerland when the oldest was 8 and youngest was 4. It would have been a huge help if my wife had been teaching them Swiss German from an early age.\n\nAn Swiss German is *vastly* less useful than English for literally anything except living in parts of Switzerland. You are depriving your kids of the chance to be truly bilingual, and it's a huge loss for them. She will absolutely*not* learn English to a decent level in French schools-I taught English there for a year and even the teachers had relatively poor English skills.\n\nIt's not too late, just start talking to your kids in English, and they will pick it up quickly. It will be frustrating first, but absolutely worth it it terms of the opportunities it opens for them later on.", "YTA.\n\nWhile choosing a language to speak to your child is of course a personal choice, doing so knowing it prevents her from communicating with her relatives is AH behaviour. Also, if you continue this way, I think she is very likely to develop some level of resentment in the future since you didn\u2019t pass this very easily passable \u201cskill\u201d to her (does a language qualify as skill?). As others said, all is needed is that you (and you only, not your husband and you) speak English to her. That alone will be enough to give her a solid foundation. By no means am I an expert but I am familiar with cases in which a child had difficulties coping with multiple languages due to a learning disability, but most studies talk about the benefits of bilingual upbringing.

French people are known for their bad English (especially pronunciation because French uses very different sounds), so any extra training is great.

It is completely and totally different and much less effective to learn a language at school.  You are depriving her of a huge opportunity.  BTW The science has proved that this does not confuse children at all.  You don't have to go to a whole lot of drama or effort if that is what you are worried about, just start speaking English with her, nothing else.

This has harmed literally none of us except for giving you an accent you will struggle to shake. When your daughter starts learning English at school you must support her by speaking English at home. This should preferably be with the most fluent between you and your husband if neither of you are fluent, so she will have consistency when she tries to learn the phonetics. Encourage her to read English and watch shows in English. Immersion is important for learning a language.\n\nIf you want to start teaching her English now, you still have ample opportunity, but it will take a couple of sacrifices. She will have to switch to communicating exclusively in English with one of you. By putting up that boundary, it prevents her from \"mixing\" the two languages, which is the \"harm\" that most parents are afraid when it comes to raising their kids bilingual. It's not some kind of made up harm either. If you aren't forced to express yourself completely in a language, you will never learn to do so and end up filling in the gaps of the one language with the other, causing the mix.\n\nThe reason your family is upset isn't because you deprive her of English. It is because you deprived them of being able to interact with her, which is the unwise bit. They want to build a relationship with her and they can't do that if they don't understand her.

If a child is brought up multilingual *not only* is it easier for them to learn more languages later, but it's also a **lot** easier for them to speak them because their palate can make more sounds. It's why so many Americans intellectually discriminate against immigrants because even if they have a full vocabulary in a second language(while many of us can't speak a second language at all and never went past Spanish 1) they still talk 'clunkily' so they are able to feel superior(when they really shouldn't).", ">But to be honest it's the same entitlement I see in many English-speaking countries, especially the US.
