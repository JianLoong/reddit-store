If you were in a position to choose, and chose *not* to have the master bedroom with its private bathroom, then it seems *a little* out of place for you to expect your restroom to have the same amount of privacy. If you were not in a position to choose, and this is imposed externally, then you obviously have no responsibity.\n\n*However*, if you *do* have a sliding door separating your section of the house, it may be best to try and treat it like a duplex. That is, if you have an entrance that leads to your side of the house, it might be worth it to leave the sliding door locked permanently as if it were a wall, and use your side of the house as if it were an independent unit (as much as possible).\n\nOn one hand, your roomate is obviously the AH. On the other hand, it's an unusual situation, and you might have *some* assholery if you made the decision which led to this setup.\n\nFor example, it's not uncommon for people to need to use the restroom in the middle of the night.

I would absolutely try to find a public option, but if push came to shove I'd shit in a trash can, then clean up after myself, before shitting all over myself. And I'd never go back to that person's place ever again.", "Not OPs guests...not OPs problem! Ops bathroom just happens to have 2 doors one attached to his room, so he closed one off going to the hallway since he pays for that privilege.\nRoommate can leave his room open for his own guest.", "No, the roommate who is letting his shitty friends sleep in a common is in the wrong. The bathroom distribution was agreed on in advance. \n\nWhy should OP have to clean up after his roommates friends? It's one thing to clean up after your own guests but to have to manage a shared bathroom while the roommate gets an ensuite? No. Just no.", "what a considerate cat! \ud83d\ude02\n\nanimals are kind of funny like that - they instinctively want to keep their environment clean. i have guinea pigs and even though they have.... well, tiny bladders, they still try to let you know they need to pee and you should put them down. \n\nshitting on someone's balcony is just.... how do you not die of shame??", "I'll bet he didn't even wipe afterwards. Maybe Mark should check the leaves on his potted plants on the patio.", "I can, but those friends (and family members) are all canine.", "No, you wake up, see the bathrooms are locked, and leave. Go home. Go to a fast food place. Shit yourself. I don't care but you are clearly not wanted. Just leave. Do not shit anywhere in their house, that's disgusting. Just leave. Are you homeless? Why do you feel the need to stay in a place you aren't wanted?", "Then the \"friend\" needed to leave the apartment and go home or go to a fast food establishment or the woods or anywhere but someone's porch.", "Lmfao yes I am homeless and I have a fetish for being around people who want nothing to do with me. Wtf? I'm not saying I'd wake up and immediately shit in someone's home. But if I was INVITED TO STAY- being invited into someone's home implies you are wanted there, even if it's for a short time- and I woke up and suddenly found I had nowhere to go to the bathroom I am not going to sit there and piss myself. I'm going to find an alternative, obviously a public bathroom would be the first choice. But if I couldn't hold it, I'm not going all over myself. And you can't be surprised someone shits on your patio when you've invited them into your home then refuse them access to a bathroom. Is it disgusting? Yes. But so is pissing/shitting in your pants and then having to drive yourself home.", "Or bang on Mark's bedroom door until he let him use the actual toilet he's supposed to", "Fast food establishment is likely closed during the middle of the night, for us the absolute latest is Taco Bell at 1am. Everywhere else is 9pm. And someone who just woke up to use the bathroom during the middle of the night probably isn\u2019t safe to drive. Groggy, uncoordinated people don\u2019t belong on the road. I don\u2019t disagree that \u201con the porch\u201d is not the right answer, but depending on the neighborhood there may have been limited options accessible.", "The person who invited you locked you out of the bathroom that you were told to use. That's a clear sign to just leave and find somewhere else to be at. Do not use someone trash, sink, porch or sofa as a toilet. Just leave. You need to learn that there are different types of communication- maybe they said \"sure, crash here\" but the tone and body language was \"go home as soon as possible.\" \n\nIf you wake up and there is no toilet to use, its a sign that you need to leave.\n\nYeah, going in your car is a better option than in someone else's deck. It's your problem, not the roommate of the guy whose house you are staying at.", "That also punishes the roommate and neighbors. He can just leave. He doesn't live there and as an adult, he can just go home.", "Exactly this!", "He still needs to leave and go somewhere. Doesn't matter where. Sorry, not familiar with the hours of a fast \"food\" type situation, always heard they were open 24/7. \n\nThe guy could just go home. He's an adult, why is he sleeping over.", "NTA and WTF?\n\n His friend/s need to get out of your house. But whilst there he needs to ensure he is the one inconvenienced by their presence,", "NTA.\n\nThis is disgusting. Mark is obviously being unreasonable. I don\u2019t even know why this is a question. If he\u2019s inviting friends over, he\u2019s responsible for their bathroom needs. If he doesn\u2019t want to allow them access to his bathroom, he\u2019s responsible for cleaning up their mess on the patio.\n\nSeems like a good reason to evict someone IMO, but I like to live without drunk guys in my common living areas or poop on my patio.", "But obviously his friends are super mature and respectful \ud83d\ude44\n\nFor f sake NTA!  If a friend of mine pooped on my patio I would be sooo apologetic! I\u2019d see if you could get rid of him. People like that are also not going to respect a locked door eventually and may try to break through it", "NTA. Why is he letting them stay over if he's uncomfortable with them being in his space?", "OMG someone actually took a dump on the patio?  If your roommate is going to have a guest, that guest needs to have access to the roommate's bathroom.  It's unfortunate you all don't have a communal bathroom, that would be ideal, but then everyone would argue who would clean it I guess.  \n\nNTA.", "This. Is drugs.", "NTA. Tell mark if he doesn\u2019t want people using his bathroom to stop having overnight guests. The solution is simple.", "NTA why\u2019d he sign the lease agreement if he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable living in that sorta situation?", "I\u2019m sorry what!? NTA!", "NTA, Why is your roomate allowing homeless people to poop in your yard. Evickt him", "NTA- tell mark to grow the fuck up", "op=NTA\n\nHe either doesn't have Friends overnight or he lets them in to USE his bathroom.\n\nDon't let him bully you into acquiescing to his demands.", "NTA. First and foremost, if it's in the lease, you're already absolved from any YTA judgement. Still: His buddy crapped on your porch? Does that not prove you're NTA? I'm pretty sure that proves you're NTA. I actually had the same arrangement with an old roommate, she had a bedroom w the hall bath, my girlfriend and I had the master w the private bath. My friend crashed on the couch and DESTROYED her toilet, stains, clog, stank, the whole 9. I never thought it was a big deal until that moment. But your roommates buddy crapped on your porch instead of just waking him up? I can't get over that.", "NTA. Using someone else's bathroom in that situation is only for true emergencies, like \"Mark is taking a dump and friend 1 REALLY has to pee RIGHT NOW\", not for \"Mark likes to sleep naked and alone\"", "His friend took a shit on the patio?? WTF?????  \n\n\nKick this guy out. He's trash.", "If he doesn't trust his friends in his space, then they have no business in your home.  NTA and Mark needs to GO!", "Make Mark abide by the lease or kick him out and find a new roommate.  Your bathroom is yours, not Mark's to hand out to his friends...  NTAH.", "Nta", "nta- you all made an agreement, he should take care of his guests.  Not to mention, they are f'n thieves.", "This. OP, tell your roommate if he doesn't want people using his bathroom at night, his friends shouldn't spend the night. But they will not ever use your bathroom again. So if he doesn't want to have to clean up shit, either his friends don't spend the night, or he leaves his door unlocked.\n\nYou know, or wears clothes when he has friends over...", "He probably doesn't even actually sleep naked. When I had roommates and a private bath (2 different times/leases/groups) I would tell their friends I slept naked so they wouldn't use my bathroom. I was hardly ever naked.", "Just ew....", "Where's he supposed to go when he's locked out of both bathrooms, especially given the implication that he's too drunk to drive that crashing on the couch gives?  Kitchen trash can?", "Well his friends apparently think it's acceptable to take a dump on the patio; I'd be uncomfortable too.\n\nMaybe Mark had a hard time making friends and this is the best he can do. I wouldn't find that surprising.\n\nI'm kidding, of course. This is kinda sad though.", "I think that\u2019s a matter of consent. My ex and I had a friend sleeping on the couch for three days while they were in town for a conference, and none of our housemates had a problem with that.", "Bruh, the poor dude was in an unfortunate situation. His shitty friend told him he could stay over and didn't make sure he had access to a bathroom. OP said they're often drunk, so going/driving home probably wasn't an option. Woods aren't available everywhere and neither are fast food establishments or public transportation at night. It's 100% on OPs roommate to clean up the shit imo.", "You do realize the whole point of crashing on the couch is because these people were likely too drunk to drive, right?  The options at that point are drive home drunk or crap your pants in the uber driver's car instead, assuming one is even up at that time of night in their area.", "You\u2019re reading a lot of assumptions into this scenario. Also some people aren\u2019t capable of understanding subtext, failing to grasp tone and body language is a quintessential feature of autism. Being direct is always the best policy. You can\u2019t fault someone for not understanding something they were never told.\n\nI think it\u2019s much more likely that roommate thought OP would wake up and unlock the door, with interrupted sleep \u201cteaching them a lesson\u201d for locking his friends out of the bathroom. Not providing appropriate facilities for a guest is peak rudeness. Denying someone a bathroom is not an effective way to communicate \u201cyou\u2019re not wanted here\u201d, it just makes you look like a lousy host who lacks forethought.", "While you can get food 24/7 in some, they usually close the dining room around 10 or so.", "So crap in the car, in a bag or something. Just fucking leave.  Who cares where they go? They are adults, they shouldn't get so drunk they can't walk home. There is NO situation where it is OK for someone to shit on the porch and go back to bed on the couch. JUST LEAVE when you have to \"go.\" \n\nDon't be an animal. He's an adult, not a six year old. They can leave at any time.", "Thank you! Wtf is this \"let's talk about communication\" and then pivot to pick up on body language and such lol no. Just say \"hey no you can't stay here, sorry.\" That's how adult communicate. They don't say yea sure stay and then lock guests out of the facilities.", "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the non-verbal communication in a \"sure, stay over, whatever\" and then locking you out of the bathroom. \n\nAdults can leave whenever they want. If the accommodation isn't comfortable, just go home."]}
