Or is this an agreement decided by a separate landlord? *Typically*, a master bedroom gets its own bathroom, and the other bathroom is the \"public\" restroom, shared among guests and other tenants. If you were in a position to choose, and chose *not* to have the master bedroom with its private bathroom, then it seems *a little* out of place for you to expect your restroom to have the same amount of privacy. If you were not in a position to choose, and this is imposed externally, then you obviously have no responsibity.\n\n*However*, if you *do* have a sliding door separating your section of the house, it may be best to try and treat it like a duplex. That is, if you have an entrance that leads to your side of the house, it might be worth it to leave the sliding door locked permanently as if it were a wall, and use your side of the house as if it were an independent unit (as much as possible).\n\nOn one hand, your roomate is obviously the AH. On the other hand, it's an unusual situation, and you might have *some* assholery if you made the decision which led to this setup.\n\nFor example, it's not uncommon for people to need to use the restroom in the middle of the night. If guests are allowed (e.g. sleeping on the couch), then it makes more sense for them to use the hallway bathroom since that has less likelihood of waking someone up than going *through* the master bedroom to access a bathroom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
