People have different sleep cycles and should not be dependant on each other to sleep. Your husband needs to learn how to go to sleep on his own. If he's a light sleeper, you need to ensure you're very quiet when you come to bed. If you were away for some reason, he would need to put himself to bed.

If you haven't communicated what is going on with you, including the impact of the medication change, you should. I'd also recommend that conversation happen at a time other than at bed time.

I occasionally like to stay up and watch Netflix or doom scroll after putting our toddler to bed. Husband has been trying to go to bed earlier these days, around 10pm. Sometimes I join him, but last night I stayed up watching a show. He came out of our room twice to ask me to come to bed in an obviously annoyed tone. Then I received a text that said \"it would really help me if you came to bed\". \n\nI told him I'm sorry but I just want to do my own thing for a while, and asked him not to take my insomnia and binge watching personally. He responded by saying he feels like I don't care about his feelings and he is hurt that I chose a show over him. He has sleep problems and we have both been talking about trying to practice better sleep hygiene, so I understand his frustration,  but I just don't feel like I should be responsible for his feelings, or for putting him to bed. I already did that with our son..\n\nI know the kind thing to do would have been to just put my phone down and come to bed, but I've also been dealing with some insomnia due to a new medication and forcing sleep when I'm not at all tired sounds like the absolute worst. It just bothers me that he feels like he needs me to sleep. That responsibility should not be on me, although I get it. I am lucky to have someone who loves me that much.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But also she's not beholden to have to go to bed when he wants to because he's a light sleeper. You said in a comment you don't want to normalize sleeping in separate beds so it's going to be a bunch of trial-and-error until you find a system that works for you both.", "You aren\u2019t responsible for his feelings, but you certainly weren\u2019t supportive of them either. How would toy feel if he dismissed your feelings/concerns? Sounds like the two of you need to work on communicating and fostering intimacy (not saying sex).", "NAH. We are the opposite\u2014I go up to bed when I start to feel sleepy; husband stays up to watch TV and generally falls asleep on the couch. The problem was, when he would finally come upstairs, I would wake up\u2026he would fall asleep and start snoring and then I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. It used to bother me that he chose to stay up watching TV, knowing that he would fall asleep down there and then wake me up, but I finally realized that\u2019s just how he works. Rather than continue to fight over it\u2014and ending up very grouchy over not getting sleep when he woke me up after coming to bed\u2014we decided to sleep separately. It\u2019s worked for us for the past 15 or so years.", "I stay up late too. My compromise with my husband is he wears a sleep mask and I wear Bluetooth headphones to watch TV in bed. Works really well for us :)", "Nta, if you're never doing it, then I'd say you are,but u said it's occasionally. Your allowed to have personal time and stay up.", "This is a tricky one.  My husband suffers with bipolar, thankfully hasn\u2019t had an episode in about 10 years but sleep is the most important thing to ensure that he doesn\u2019t have another episode.  It was hard for me when we first started dating as I used to stay up late but I understand it now and go to bed earlier.  On side note, sometimes I\u2019m really tired and he\u2019ll take a shower late and I can\u2019t fall asleep.  Not really a rule that you should go to bed at the same time but it\u2019s much more helpful for both of us, when we go to bed around the same time.  I\u2019m a much better and happier person and worker when I get to bed earlier.  If one of us is tossing and turning, we\u2019ll go to guest bedroom.  Sleep is important, staying up and watching Netflix is fun\u2026it\u2019s a difficult compromise sometimes.", "YTA and also I can see a N A H. I relate to you and hubby here. \n\nWhen I am anxious about sleep and it's hard to fall asleep, I find it nearly impossible to have good sleep when I anticipate my wife will join later and disturb me at some point in my sleep process, making it hard or impossible to fall back asleep. That's not my wife's fault, but it is just a logic problem to solve for. For sure, I'd love to have a completely easy and unfettered relationship with sleep, but I don't, and also I would like to sleep, so here we are. I am also a toddler mom to a 2 and a 4, and I know how much those hours after they go to sleep mean to me in terms of feeling like a grown up in my Cartman voice \"Whateva, I do what I want.\" \n\nControversial, but something that has worked for us and might help quiet husband's anxious brain is agreeing that on nights you stay away after 10pm, you will go to sleep in a different room, if you have space, or that he will. That way, no one is disturbing anyone's slumber and everyone gets to do what they want and be happy and rested and doom scrolled. I think there's too much stigma about separate sleep as a harbinger of doom when sometimes it's just a practical solution.", "NTA-- a grown man should not need you to go to sleep especially when he is the one who switched his sleep schedule and knows you have insomnia", "NTA.  Do you use a sound machine?  This helps tremendously with not disturbing the other when one of you is restless or coming to bed later.", "Watch Netflix on phone with headphones", "Sometimes I just go in and doom scroll on my phone and put my hand on my husband's back while he falls asleep. OP's NTA for not wanting to go to bed and her husband's rude for being an asshole while asking for a favor, but sometimes the comfort of someone being next to you can help you sleep when you're having trouble.", "Actually our relationship improved like 1000% when my fiance and I started sleeping in separate rooms during the week (we still sleep together on weekends). Sleeping together only led us to being more tired...together.\nNTA.", "Yes! \n\n[\"More than 1/3 of Americans have a sleep divorce, survey finds\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sleep-divorce-americans-survey/)\n\nSleep divorces for everyone! I love mine. No one takes my covers. I don't hear the 563 alarms my wife sets before she actually gets out of bed. I can fall asleep watching garbage TV. \n\nI would bet technology changed married couples' relationship to sleep a lot. \n\nIn every show from the 60s, people are just sitting around in bed, reading books next to each other. TV, cable TV, TV on demand, streaming services, laptops, phones-- those things mean we have so many more options and autonomy than we once did. When you're married with a toddler and a job, it can sure feel like autonomy and free time are hard to come by.", "Yes.  He takes melatonin and uses a fan to help with noise.", "As a light sleeper there is absolutely no way I'd fall asleep with someone next to me with their phone light on even if they are wearing headphones.", "They have a toddler all day. It's demanding. She has a right to unwind as well. I dont think there are any assholes here.", "OP has said she wakes him up when she goes to bed after.\n\nOP is an AH.\n\nSleep separately on those nights so OP does not awaken him.", "So you do wake him up when you stay up longer then? This isn't a \"he needs you to sleep\" but a \"he needs you to not wake him up when you decide to go to bed\"", "Ok. I asked because I felt like I could have written your post. We do the same but roles are reversed.\n\nNAH. As a light sleeper myself, when you finally come rolling into the room a few hours later I\u2019m sure it\u2019s waking him up. Then, sometimes, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s unable to get back to sleep. My husband stays up late on his phone, working out, etc.\n\nYou need to be more respectful of the late night activities and keeping the noise down. You want to watch Netflix? Mute the TV and read the captions or get headphones the volume can feed into. If you\u2019re doomscrolling, same thing. Mute the volume or headphones. If it\u2019s a light issue, he may find it more helpful to wear eye covers. I\u2019ve started to do that, and as long as it\u2019s quiet with the noise machine on, it works well.\n\nYou\u2019re keeping him awake. As a parent, I understand that post bedtime is the only time you really have alone to do what you choose for the length of time you choose. I also understand how rage inducing it is to have fallen slightly asleep for an hour or two, and your noisy spouse waking you up getting into bed. Then you cannot go back to sleep for hours. It\u2019s awful and disruptive.\n\nTalk to your husband and find out what it is that\u2019s bothering him/keeping him awake. Maybe it\u2019s the act itself of you coming into the room, messing around trying to get changed, brushing teeth, night routine, etc. If it\u2019s that, do your night routine before bedtime. Get pajamas on, brush your teeth and wash your face before putting the kiddo to bed, etc. This way once you\u2019re done watching something or scrolling, all you do is climb into bed and pass out.", "Man needs silicone ear plus and an eyemask. Having separate comforters, even on the same bed, helps too. We stayed at an airbnb in berlin where the king bed was really two twins pushed together with two comforters and it was genius.", "Nah, everyone's responsible for finding solutions for their own sleep. If her getting in bed wakes him up, he needs to communicate that he wants her to sleep outside the room when she goes to bed late, not insist she goes to bed when he goes to bed. \n\nIt's not OP's job to read his mind or cowtow to unreasonable demands just to make him happy.", "Nope. This is my husband and I, except for his nagging. When I finally go to bed and he wakes up, he rolls over to me, throws his leg over mine, and smiles happily. And then falls asleep.", "It's both. He sleeps better when I'm in bed with him and he is a light sleeper so I wake him up when I come to bed, although I try not to.", "Thank you.  I try to do those things but could definitely be more consistent with them. Good idea about the headphones!  I think for him there's an emotional component (feeling abandoned in favor of netflix) as well as the interrupted sleep. Both would be very hard to deal with in the wee hours.", "What though? \n\nHusband has said he is working on sleep hygiene and is stressed about sleep. She says she wakes him up when she comes into the room and he's already asleep. That's not like, advanced detective work or anything. \n\nIf I'm standing on your foot and you say \"ow,\" it's on me to remove my foot, even if you don't ask. Sure, you should ask, but context clues here are pretty strong. I think it's hard for married people to ask for separate sleeping arrangements because of the meaning we ascribe to that. I wish that weren't the case.", "Ok, so do you have somewhere else to sleep. Like, if he is ready to go to bed and you're not, don't come in and wake him up when *you* are ready to sleep.", "At least one night a week would you be open to silently doom scrolling, in the dark, in bed? That could be one way to try and have your time, but also you\u2019re nearby so his needs on closeness in proximity are met. \n\nHe also needs to understand that some nights you need your alone time. It\u2019s also a fair request and you deserve time alone, no one clinging to you, or asking for your attention.\n\nPerhaps 2-3 nights a week you silently doom scroll next to him. Then the other nights of the week you do your thing in front of the TV.", "Yes we have a guest bedroom but we've talked about it and we don't want to get into the habit of sleeping in separate beds ;/", "I was just thinking about something similar--scheduling my late nights in advance so that he knows what to expect, as theyre not a nightly occurrance. I would be fine with the late night scrolling in bed, but even in dark mode the light bothers him. He does not like to wear a sleeping mask or earplugs bc they're uncomfortable for him. I agree there should be some compromise made.", "Either get into the same sleep pattern \n\nOR \n\nSleep in separate rooms.\n\nWhat you are doing to selfish.\n\nYou wake him up when you get in bed.\n\nSelfish."]}
