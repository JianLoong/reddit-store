I have been having problems with my nephew Sam (10m) when he comes over and spends the night. He is very rude and disrespectful, one night I was telling Lee no electronics during dinner my basic rule. Sam told me it was a dumb rule and I\u2019m stupid for having it. I told him he is a child and I\u2019m an adult and Lee\u2019s parent while I was saying this Sam was laughing and smiling at me. I continued to explain why this was a rule and he still called it dumb and I\u2019m stupid. I have had many situations like this including when he was told no food or drinks in Lee\u2019s room because he leaves half empty soda cans and food and won't clean up. \n\nHe also walks into my room or Lee\u2019s room multiple times in the middle of the night without knocking. I have woken up to him digging through my room looking for a cord. I started locking the door to the stairs but wake up to him trying to openit with a butter knife and either getting in or giving up. I tried to talk to Sam\u2019s mom but she told me she was ignoring me and didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I talked to my mom and dad and they seemed receptive but brushed it under the rug. \n\nI have even planning my sons birthday party and my bf and his family are nice enough to host it at their house. (my parents won\u2019t allow me to have it at the house.)They run a church and are very strict, I worry about how Sam would respond and then it could possibly ruin the party for everyone else. They are big on respecting adults and your parents. So Lee mentioned to Sam while playing that he was having a party, Sam asked if he was invited and Lee said no because of your behavior and disrespect. Sam went running to my mom and my mom told me I\u2019m being cruel, he is 10 and his dad died. I reminded her that no one has been addressing his behavior and that his dad died a year ago and that actions have consequences. My mom told me I have 30 days to move out and if I don\u2019t she will get a restraining order against me. Then she went and told Lee that this is the consequences of being cruel. Am I wrong, should his dads death be an excuse to treat people badly?\u00a0", "created_utc": 1685390903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v530u/aita_for_not_inviting_my_nephew_to_my_sons_bday/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was way over the top.", "NTA. Having a parent die is NOT an excuse for bad behavior. It might be expected first few months, but still needs correcting. If it's been a year then there is no excuse for his behavior other than he's a little Sh*t.\n\nYou aren't even the host of the birthday party so you can't just invite anyone you want (even though it's your son and technically you could invite who you wanted) but that's the excuse I would give. Only good boys and girls are allowed at BFs parents house and space is limited.\n\n Tell mom and dad fine, you'll move just hope they remember this moment when they are unable to care for themselves anymore. They don't want you in their house...be prepared to never go back (even to visit).", "NTA, his dad's death would be reason to understand improper behavior, but is no excuse to not redirect said behavior into a more positive way. Sounds like everyone is checked out and that kid is going to be in a rough place when people that don't cater to him become more present in his life.", "NTA. It sucks that his dad died but it's not doing the kid any favors to completely abandon all forms of parenting and teaching the kid basic acceptable social interactions and expectations. There should be grace and understanding given for a child who lost a parent but that doesn't excuse all behavior that should be checked. It's your son's birthday party and he should have one that isn't ruined by a kid that's allowed to be a brat.", "NTA. Your nephew is definitely old enough to know to act better than this, and, although losing his father is tragic, it is no excuse for his behavior. I think not inviting him is a reasonable consequence for his behavior.\n\nConsidering how his and your mother acted about this, I can see how this child grew up this way, and this is how entitled adults are formed.", "NTA. It's important, now more than ever, for that kid to get some solid rules and consequences in life. Sucks that you are getting punished for wanting it, but maybe you don't want to live in a chaotic house where anything goes after all.", "NTA - youve tried to help this kid and bring up their behavior, and no one will listen.", "NTA.  In fact, your reason for why you \"might be one\" is a stretch and it's not even addressing the biggest issue.  \n\nOf course it's sad his dad died, but that has nothing to do with your decision to not include him.  Your bf's parents have graciously offered their home for **your** party.  It would have been incredibly rude on your part to include a kid you know won't be respectful and who will stress them out.  *That* is the real issue here.", "NTA you\u2019re between a rock and a hard place. You\u2019re having the birthday party at a place that has strict rules so you need to follow them and your choice not to invite a rude and disrespectful child is reasonable but you\u2019re living ins place that also has rules that you have to follow and now you will have to move out. What you really need to do is move out and have your own rules. From then on you can decide what happens in your home and who is invited to your home and and gatherings you have there.", "NTA. \nThe kid is being raised to be an AH. The real\nAH is the kids mom and partially your mom. Kids need boundaries and if they don\u2019t find them they will act out until they find it. I feel bad for Sam. \nCall your moms bluff and move out a d go NC for a while.", "NTA. Sam sounds like an asshole in the making. You're not being cruel. Just because his dad died doesn't mean he gets to snoop around people's houses without permission and be willfully disrespectful toward his elders. He's not acting out of pain. He just doesn't want the inconvenience of being unplugged for less than an hour to eat. And it's creepy how he just walks into your room during the night, what the fuck?? Ten is old enough to know that's weird enough to do to your own parents and siblings, let alone extended relatives. Someone needs to start telling this kid no, or he's going to be a problem for society when he grows up.", "Just how long does your family plan to allow \"his dad died\" to fly as an excuse for his bad behavior? Two years? Three? Five? Ten? Twenty??", "This looks a way to similar from the mom who posted her son couldn\u2019t spend. The night at her brothers house.  She proceeded to get all butt hurt over the fact that maybe her nephew doesn\u2019t view her son as a friend.  \n\nAnyway, I smell troll.", "NTA. Just move out that way you don\u2019t have to deal with AH Sam and your AH mom.", "NTA and I've got $10 pretend dollars that says your sister and nephew will move in as soon as you leave.", "NTA.

You are being a doormat for your parents and Sam's mother - stop it now.  \n\nAs for the restraining order - I don't know where you live, but I can't think of any court that will issue a restraining order because you refused to invite a 10-year-old to a party.  \n\nMom's likely blowing smoke with that threat, but book 15 minutes of an attorney's time to confirm.  While you have the attorney's attention, ask him what the process is for your parents to evict you from their home so you are armed with that knowledge too, because that will be mom's next threat.  Be prepared to show the attorney any written agreements you have with your parents and copies of payments you routinely make for utilities and groceries. \n\nIt won't be smooth or easy, but standing up to mom now will gain you time to arrange your life.  And if you are there because mom and/or dad need help with transportation or cooking or bathing, be sure to find out the going rate for home care workers so you can present them with a bill for your services.  They won't pay it, but it will make them think about what it will cost them if they toss you out, because no way is Sam's mother going to step in and take over those duties.", "NTA. The major AS in here are your parents and Sam's mom. You can't possibly be expected to be so fkng disrespected and be okey with that. \n\nThat kid's been breaking into your room in the middle of the night FORCING THE LOCK, mocking your parenting and insulting you. Having a dead parent isn't a 'been a little sh*t and getting away with that pass'. It might be expected the first months, but it's been a whole year and he isn't been reprimanded or corrected by HIS MOTHER, who's the one that should be a parent to her child, not let him get away with that terrible behavior that will be harder to correct as the time goes by.\n\nAnd your parents are also part of the problem, they are enabling this behavior and making it worse by punishing YOU because of something so insignificant. Sam is seen that whatever he does he's never in the wrong, and won't have consecuences on him.", "Are you the mother in this story?"]}
