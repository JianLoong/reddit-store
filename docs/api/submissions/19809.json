After work we\u2019re both entertaining, feeding and getting the kids ready for bed. When the time came, my wife was getting ready to put our daughter down for the night and I was gonna put our son down shortly later. \n\nAs she goes upstairs I sit on the couch with my son to give him 15 minutes of his favorite show as a part of his nighttime routine before I take him upstairs and get him ready for bed. As he starts watching his show, I take my phone out and start an online game on it that typically lasts 10-15 minutes. \n\n10 minutes later my wife comes downstairs, sits on the couch with us and starts talking to me. I try to respond to every question she asks and keep the conversation going but admittedly I\u2019m distracted by the game and I\u2019m not engaging properly. \n\nShe starts to get mad and asks me if I\u2019m really gonna choose to play a game on my phone instead of talking to her and to either put it down right away or finish whatever I was doing and then talk to her. I asked her if she wouldn\u2019t mind waiting no more than 5 minutes to finish since I couldn\u2019t pause it and I had already invested 10 minutes into the game and it was pretty close to being done before she came downstairs. \n4 minutes later the game is done, I put my phone down, go sit next to her and ask if she wants to continue with the conversation. She tells me no and that she\u2019s really mad that I would choose a game over her. I apologized and tried to explain that I didn\u2019t realize that meant I chose the game over her and I just wanted to finished what I started before I knew she would join me. She keeps saying ITA and nothing I tell her will convince her otherwise. She says that\u2019s a behavior addicts are showing and I should know better. She didn\u2019t want to talk to me the rest of the night and even the following morning she\u2019s still mad at me. \n\n\nI like playing video games and it\u2019s a good reliever for me but I barely play anymore since our kids have been born so I was surprised to hear that. \nI didn\u2019t think those extra 5 minutes would be a big deal but my wife says otherwise. \nAny input is appreciated.", "created_utc": 1686914723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aubam/aita_33m_for_finishing_a_video_game_before_giving/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I caught my husband in the middle of an online match I'd wait for him to finish before chatting to him.\n\nHe's not disrespecting me by not instantly giving me all his attention.

Now I know that it\u2019s just a game, but was her conversation about life-changing subject or could it have waited until the son was put to bed? The activity is never more important than a person but it\u2019s nice to be able to shut your brain down for a few minutes before going back to your responsibilities.", "NTA.

Especially considering OP only continued playing for four mins!\n\nThere was no need to cause an argument over OP wanting a couple of mins to finish what they were doing, he was still looking after his son and was taking a bit of time to decompress, are we only allowed to do something for ourselves if our partner says it is okay, do we have to immediately stop when they decide you have done enough?", "INFO: I understand that with two kids, you don\u2019t get much time for gaming. How much time do you and your wife get for intimate moments together?", "NTA since you acknowledged her. Either something deeper is going on or she\u2019s way too uptight and needs to relax.

You need to read between the lines here. Nobody blowes up over that in a vacuum. Maybe she needs a date night without the kids, maybe she feels disregarded lately, maybe just an afternoon at the spa by herself, maybe she really doesn't handle stress well. Whatever it is, I advise you to tease it out.", "NTA. It happens. What if it were a phone call? What if he were reading? He was engaged in the activity before she came back down. She doesn\u2019t get to demand his attention immediately. She can wait until he is finished then proceed with the conversation. I have done this countless times in my personal and professional life. It\u2019s common courtesy, TBH.", "NTA.\n\nI have to assume some of these comments saying YTA are coming from unmarried people, teenagers, or *controlling* people. You did nothing wrong. Your wife needs to chill.", "NAH. It sounds like you two have a communication problem. Playing a game while your kid watches TV or asking your wife to wait 5 minutes are not automatically right or wrong. You guys need to figure out what *your* system is. And when you discover that there are bumps in the road or disagreements over what is or is not ok, then do your best not to jump to conclusions about the intentions of the other and talk to each other. Try to understand her perspective. And try to separate the specific thing (played a game on phone) from how she felt (ignored, unimportant).  The better you can get at the skill of working through mismatched expectations (and not getting hung up on right vs wrong), the better your relationship will be. And you'll be teaching your kids those same skills by example.", "INFO: How often does this happen, and what was your wife trying to talk to you about?\n\nMy husband is an avid phone gamer and it is truly infuriating when I try to ask him a question or have a conversation with him and he can't give me his attention because he's too busy with this phone. From a feelings standpoint, in my situation, I definitely think he's an AH even though I suppose I could wait and hold my questions and comments until he's done with a game. It feels absolutely awful to come in second to a phone game.\n\nSo, if you're doing this regularly (prioritizing your gaming in spare moments and asking her to wait for your attention) I'd say Y-T-A.\n\nI also think it depends on what she was trying to talk to you about. I'll reiterate, it feels AWFUL to be put on pause for a video game. That said, some conversations could definitely wait if you don't mind hurting her feelings, like if she was trying to talk to you about her day or something that was important to her. Others, like plans you're both involved in, health issues for your kids, etc. are really not fair to put off for your recreational activities and would make you TA as well.", "I\u2019m sorry, I got lost at the idea of a game you can play on your phone that is interesting enough that it can\u2019t be paused, but still only lasts 10-15 minutes. I need that game.\n\nNTA for the purposes of learning the name of that game, but be nicer to your wife. \ud83d\ude09", "NTA, DONT GIVE YOUR PARTNER A CHOICE AS A TEST!\n\nIdk if its just me but I hate when grown adults do this, \"either put it down now and oay attention to me or finish it and then pay attention to me\" either way you will get the attention you want! If you didn't actually want him to finish it, that just freaking ask!!!!", "NTA.  If your wife isn't capable of entertaining herself for literally 4 minutes before turning it into an ideological war and accusing you of being an addict, that doesn't make you an AH, that makes her needy and unreasonable.", "NTA, even though if I was your wife in this situation, I would have also flipped my lid. And have done at my husband for this exact same thing. And then turned around and DONE the exact same thing myself. \n\nLife with kids can be hard, we all get knackered. \n\nYour wife would have been better to say \u2018hey, I would like your attention, do I have it?\u2019 If she is wanting to talk to you. And you would have been better to say, when she first started trying to engage with you, \u2018I\u2019m right in the middle of something, can you give me 5 mins please?\u2019\n\nSolidarity team!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s just polite to wait until a task, hobby or not, is finished before engaging with someone. You were busy, she walked in and demanded your attention. You politely asked her to wait a few minutes and apparently that was enough to send her into a tantrum. If she loses her temper over something so small, I hate to think what the larger problems escalate to.", "NTA\n\nI get it, it was a long day for both of you and she wanted to relax by talking to you while you wanted to relax by playing a game. There is nothing wrong with either point.\n\nYou were fine talking with her after this long day and would be available in 5 min for her, but **that wasn't good enough**, she wants to talk **right now** and throws a fit like a child when she doesn't get your full attention immediately. imo big yikes. \n\nPlaying the victim is also stupid, \"choosing a game over her\" imagine you would act like this whenever she does anything enjoyable instead of spending time with you. \n\nShe reads a book? How dare she choose a book over her husband. \n\nShe takes a bath? How dare she choose to relax in tub over her husband. \n\nShe wants to meet a friend? How da... you get the point.\n\nShe was exhausted, mentally drained and wanted attention after a hard day. That is fine and normal, but to act like that when she didn't get it immediately is just toxic, she made it about so much more than just the game or the 5 min. its now about the principal that you don't care about her and while her feelings are valid it is not your fault. \n\nSit down with her and address the issue, talk about maybe giving each parent an hour of free time from parenting/housework and etc. for hobbies or just to spend it alone. When was the last time she did something for herself like a reading or something she enjoys? Idk but I hope you can both get some relaxation.", "INFO: What was your wife trying to talk to you about? Who put your son to bed? Is this a recurring situation?", "NAH - You're not an addict. You're a good husband and father. You're going to have to endure the silent treatment and stick to your choice, which is self-care. You're an active parent and you're allowed to do self-care at the end of the day. \n\nIt doesn't have to be a huge argument. Just calmly stick to your position that you use a game to relax your mind at the end of the day - it's a normal behavior", "NTA. As with any relationship it's important to respect eachothers personal time. Its not unreasonable to expect 5 minutes of alone time. With that said, respect and cherish the fact that she wants to spend time with you.", "Nta. I could be wrong but part of me feels like she kinda planned it. You\u2019re quietly sitting with your son as he\u2019s watching his show and getting ready for bed. And you\u2019re on your phone playing a lil game and she comes and starts asking questions while it very clear you\u2019re on your phone just chilling with your son. Don\u2019t fall for her potential dumb tricks. If she\u2019s ignoring you then great. More time to play games and have quiet relaxing time with your son and daughter", "YTA  I\u2019m also a gamer myself and married so I understand. Don\u2019t prioritize gaming over your wife , even if it just 5min", "NTA but maybe do something nice for her; it sounds like you both have pretty hectic lives what with the kid-wrangling and work and busy days etc. maybe this could be a sign to take the time to do something just for you two, no matter how seemingly small it may be? I dunno", "INFO: who put your son to bed?", "Communication needs to be better, I feel like (instead of half-heartedly trying to answer her when she started talking to you) you should have immediately fronted said \"I'm in the middle of a game, could you please give me 5 minutes then I'd love to talk?\" because it sounds like her frustration was already there by the time you explained this. You'd probably been, in her eyes, purposefully and meanfully ignoring her (brushing her off) and would continue doing so for ages so got upset. The damage was already done before you explained but could have mitigated earlier by explaining immediately.\n\nIt sounds like there's some deeper issues at work here though. She might think you don't prioritize or value her. Attention is the purest form of love. Full proper undivided attention is rare in this day and age. Understand you're likely both busy, exhausted, and stressed but it sounds like you need some bonding one-on-one time. \n\nI love my fianc\u00e9 (a hardcore gamer) so much because he know how much I value dedicated undivided focused attention so if we have a conversation he will often pause his game or find a safe spot to AFK to look me in the eye, take my hand, and listen to me. It makes me feel soooo loved.\n\nWhereas my ex never, and I mean never, turned away from his computer screen to look at or talk to me properly. It was so demeaning to be half-heartedly talked at all the time, he clearly didn't care what I was saying or how I felt. I was invisible to him and felt like I didn't matter at all. He never ever gave me his full attention and I felt awful/unloved all the time. Don't let that happen to your relationship. I understand this is seemingly one incident but they can grow quickly. Nurture your relationship and, in turn, it will give back to you allowing you to have your own down time too.", "Info- how often do you do this? Why did she bring up addiction? These questions aren't judgment, I'm trying to understand context.\n\nOh- also was the conversation important? Was it chit  chat or was she telling you something important about the kids or something?", "YTA. Your wife is talking to you. Put down your game.", "YTA\n\nYou're 33 man, come on. Grow up. I'm 42 and still play the shit out of videogames, but I know how to prioritize my life.", "ESH\n\n She also probably has barley any time as well to do things she likes. She was trying to talk to you but you pretty much ignored her even if you responded to a few questions. She also kind of ruined a moment between you and your son and she could have waited a few minutes. She also seemed to make it a bigger deal then it needed to be. If you want to keep the peace do something nice for her like flowers or make her favorite meal. From her reaction don't expect an apology from her anytime soon. I don't think your an complete AH but I also don't think your wife is a complete AH either.", "YTA, Family Comes First. you are father be the example and Be Better.\n\nI am a mobile gamer too. if i have short window of time i always play normal mode. not the ranked game. Game in short break for passing the time not the pushing in ranking.", "Look, I struggle with this sometimes with my partner. Part of it is my baggage from a previous relationship and when he does continue a game rather than engaging it feels as if he is prioritising a game over me. Of course he doesn't mean anything by finishing the game or playing till he can get to a point where he can pause. The issue is that we are both making assumptions about the other's behaviour rather than actually discussing the action. I don't think you are intentionally being TAH but the action is an AH move. Do you see the difference? You need to be open with your wife to let her know that you understand where she is coming from, it wasn't your intent and come to some kind of compromise or safe word that allows you both to know that you just need some time.", "NTA. You're raising 3 kids. She can't go 10-15 minutes without attention while you're clearly in the middle of something? I mean just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you give in to tantrums. Switch roles and try hard to get her attention while she's busy with her skincare at night or any other activity she does on her own and doesn't want to be disturbed while at it, and I can bet, she's going to make you the problem then as well.", "ESH. I live with a gamer and I know how invested he gets, so when I see him in a middle of something, I usually wait for him to finish, because otherwise he might get annoyed (I would be too if I were reading a book and something interrupted me). It\u2019s like an unwritten rule and if you are dealing with a gamer, you should now it. On the other hand, she was trying very hard to get your attention, so she might have really needed that in that moment and it hurt her that she wasn\u2019t getting any. Either way, I think it was a moment when two of you needed something to feel better/unwind, and those needs clashed. Just have a calm and honest conversation with her, explain and apologise. And buy some flowers. But also explain to her how it works and why you wanted/needed to finish the game.", "Leaning to YTA\n\nDude, you nailed when you said, \n\n>It was a long day for both of us\n\nBOTH of you.  She needed to unwind as well and you were not there for her.  Sometimes you get to do \"me\" stuff, when you are together with your wife its \"us\" stuff.  Dont go off the deep end with this, but think about it.  After she sat down she didnt even have anyone to say, whew its been a long day.", "YTA. The thing is... actions and behaviour like that hurt partners. She is trying to connect, bond with you. Instead, you've ignored her, even if it's only for four minutes. \n\nJust take 10 seconds. Tell her you love her. Appreciate that she is trying to connect. Finish your game and go be with her.", "How would you feel if your son ignored you if he was playing a game & you wanted to talk to him?\n\nWe all make decisions about what our priorities are. In that moment your priority was the game. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to ask someone to wait a minute so you can finish what you\u2019re doing but I do think it\u2019s strange that you had 15 minutes before bedtime with just you & your son & you chose to be distracted by a game.\n\nESH\n\nBtw \u2014 who put your son to bed?", "YTA. Put down your phone, it\u2019s not that deep", "ESH. It\u2018s important to have me-time where you engage in an activity that doesn\u2018t include your partner and she should respect that, even though she had decided she wanted to talk to you in this specific moment. \n\nHowever, you know that it isn\u2018t really about the four minutes your wife had to wait. It seems like you prioritizing your games over her is a recurring issue, or else she wouldn\u2018t have reacted this way. Also, she\u2018s kinda right to say that it looks more like an addiction than a hobby: would you have been occupied writing a novel or painting, she\u2018d have been more understanding. That\u2018s not the case. You preferred starring on a little screen playing a (excuse me for the word) senseless game instead of having quality time with your family.", "YTA you\u2019re not 12. You\u2019re supposed to be a married man here. Grow up!", "Sorry, are you asking if prioritizing your game over the person you chose to spend the rest of your life and to procreate with would make her upset? You made a decision to not engage with her. I understand that having kids impacts your lives in many ways - for you, it's with videogames, for her it's spending time with you\n\nQuestion for you - is this the first time she's experienced this with you?

You can communicate that you need some time for yourself but just checking out and doing your own thing while looking after your son is not the best.

Her pushing for the conversation when you are going to have to take your son to bed in 5 minutes is her ass movement. Not sure why she couldn't wait for a private personal conversation after you put your son to bed.", "YTA. You were supposed to be spending time with your son, but you plopped him in front of a screen instead. I mean, you didn't even engage with him about the show; you ignored him to do your own thing. Then, you did the same thing to your wife, just ignored her so you could play a video game. FWIW, that video game is going to be there forever. I wouldn't be so sure about your wife.", "Can\u2019t you restart your game after a conversation with your wife? If it\u2019s a long day for both of you wouldn\u2019t you wanna talk to your wife and decompress with her instead of being on a game that can be restarted? 100% YTA it\u2019s not even about the game it\u2019s about the fact that she wanted you to listen to her and show her you respect her enough to have a conversation and you continuing to play the game showed her that she\u2019s not as important as the dumb game. Good luck getting out of this one.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. If your wife is accusing you of being addicted, this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. I understand needing quiet time and decompressing at the end of the day but you need to realize she needs that too and if she\u2019s interrupting your game time, she probably had something she really needed to ask or discuss and you were completely tuning her out. Set up a time that you can both relax when the kids are in bed or find a game you can pause.", "YTA.\n\nNo one will put \"I wish I played more video games before I died\" on their tombstone. \n\nPut the phone down.

After work we\u2019re both entertaining, feeding and getting the kids ready for bed. When the time came, my wife was getting ready to put our daughter down for the night and I was gonna put our son down shortly later. As she goes upstairs I sit on the couch with my son to give him 15 minutes of his favorite show as a part of his nighttime routine before I take him upstairs and get him ready for bed. As he starts watching his show, I take my phone out and start an online game on it that typically lasts 10-15 minutes. 10 minutes later my wife comes downstairs, sits on the couch with us and starts talking to me. I try to respond to every question she asks and keep the conversation going but admittedly I\u2019m distracted by the game and I\u2019m not engaging properly. She starts to get mad and asks me if I\u2019m really gonna choose to play a game on my phone instead of talking to her and to either put it down right away or finish whatever I was doing and then talk to her. I asked her if she wouldn\u2019t mind waiting no more than 5 minutes to finish since I couldn\u2019t pause it and I had already invested 10 minutes into the game and it was pretty close to being done before she came downstairs. \n4 minutes later the game is done, I put my phone down, go sit next to her and ask if she wants to continue with the conversation. She tells me no and that she\u2019s really mad that I would choose a game over her. I apologized and tried to explain that I didn\u2019t realize that meant I chose the game over her and I just wanted to finished what I started before I knew she would join me. She keeps saying ITA and nothing I tell her will convince her otherwise. She says that\u2019s a behavior addicts are showing and I should know better. She didn\u2019t want to talk to me the rest of the night and even the following morning she\u2019s still mad at me. \nI like playing video games and it\u2019s a good reliever for me but I barely play anymore since our kids have been born so I was surprised to hear that. \nI didn\u2019t think those extra 5 minutes would be a big deal but my wife says otherwise. \nAny input is appreciated.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then they get angry when we decide to finish what we're doing and not give them the attention right that moment.  I chalk it up to jealousy.
