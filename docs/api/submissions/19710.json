I had no problem with taking this but I did know that Jake is allergic to penicillin. \n\nOnce I got my meds I called him to tell him where I would keep it so that he can stay away from it. He told me that it couldn't be in the apartment and I can't take it around him because he was deathly allergic to it.\nHe said I should get rid of it and take pain meds to get better on my own instead. I suggested that I could go stay at my parents house for the next few days whilst I'm taking my meds.\n\nHe said that we'd talk about it when he got home, but until then I either needed to get rid of them or leave them in my car without taking them. But I didn't want to wait 7 hours for him to come home before taking them. \n\nI decided to just go to my parents house because I wanted to take them, and I'd probably end up going there later after we talked.\n\nWhen I got to my parents, I stayed in bed for the rest of the day and fell asleep at some point. I woke up around 5am to loads of calls and texts from Jake and some mutual friends asking where I was.\n\nI waited a while before calling Jake back and he asked where I was and when I answered he angrily told me that it was disrespectful of me to leave without waiting for him to discuss this and that I was making a big situation by ignoring his calls last night. \n\nI tried to explain to him that I wasn't ignoring him, that I'm sick and I had fallen asleep at my parents and that I didn't think it would be a big deal because I had already suggested it on the phone to him yesterday.\n\nHe said that he didn't remember me telling him this, and that he was calling friends all last night asking if they knew where I was and that it was suspicious that I had been distant with him for the past few weeks just to dissappear last night. \n\nI may be the AH for this part, but I told him that it's not my fault that he didn't remember me telling him this, and that he knew I had been feeling unwell over the past few weeks which explains why I was distant. I then said that he was the one being ridiculous as there was no way that having penicillin in the same apartment as him would even cause any problems if he stayed away from it.\n\nAfter this he said that I was being TA for belittling him and not taking his allergies seriously. He then told me to just stay at my parents for the next while until he's ready to talk again before hanging up, and he's not answered any of my calls since. \n\nAs I've been stuck in bed thinking about it, part of me just feels like I might have been too stubborn and I could have avoided all of this by waiting the couple of hours or trying to get better without the antibiotics. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686786849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149n447/aita_22f_for_choosing_to_take_meds_that_my_bf_27m/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're bf is a dangerous, controlling AH. Move out while he's not there and dump him.", "The only way he could be in danger from your antibiotics is if he rummages through other people\u2019s medicine (for reasons?) and takes clearly labeled pills that aren\u2019t his just because.\n\nImagine being so controlling that you would rather your partner go without necessary medicine for no reason and \u2018take pain killers to get better by yourself\u2019 after already being sick for a week. \n\nNTA OP and this AH is out of line", "NTA. I've never heard of a proximity reaction to penicillin. Your doctor prescribed this medication, and your medical needs are as important as his.", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t he just call ur parents if he was so concerned? Also the fact that he wants you to just deal with being sick as opposed to having taking the medication is insane and weirdly controlling especially when you going to ur parents house is seemingly not an acceptable option. \n\nI would cut ur losses on this fella. He can\u2019t see past his nonsense to even seemingly care you are sick. This type of behavior is only going to get worse and more insane as he gets older and has effectively broken you down by making you feel like these issues are your fault. Controlling behaviors like this are usually signs of bigger issues. This coupled with his lack of empathy for your illness and calling you suspicious for being distant while sick is not a good sign.", "NTA - your boyfriend is being a terrible asshole.  You don't just \"get better\" when you need antibiotics a lot of the time.  A lot of the little tiny illnesses that are easy to treat now adays killed and crippled people before antibiotics were a thing.

Get better and then sit down and talk to him about this.", "NTA bf sounds a lil nutty", "ESH - having the tablets in the apartment might not be dangerous to him but kissing or sex while you\u2019re on the medication very much might be; and if his allergy really is that severe then it\u2019s possible even the empty packages in the room might be a trigger. But even if he\u2019s not that violently allergic, his anxiety over a potentially life-threatening condition that could escalate in minutes is reasonable and you should have considered it. You should have mentioned his allergy to your doctor so they could provide alternative treatments. Him asking to talk to you before you started the course was a pretty minimal request for basic consideration in that context.\n\nHaving said that, going to your parents\u2019 to take your medication was a reasonable compromise and better than just going without medication - your partner was also unreasonable to just tell you to go without treatment; that isn\u2019t wise and could end up being uncomfortable or even dangerous for you too. He was out of line to reject your explanation for not contacting him and overreacted badly. Having been woken early might contribute to him forgetting you\u2019d said where you were going, especially mid dispute.\n\nYou are both tired and concerned for your own health but you need to make the effort to communicate better and support each other if you want your relationship to last. You\u2019re meant to care about each other; start showing it.", "ESH. His reaction was pretty extreme to the meds themselves, but I don't understand why you went to your parents house without informing him after you agreed to meet and talk later.

It's severe enough that when my child was on penicillin for an ear infection and I got a drop of the liquid on my hand, I got a hive. \n\nSo...I just wore gloves and washed my hands after giving the meds. \n\nYour boyfriend either has control issues or a severe phobia of his allergy.

We already weren't being too physically intimate because I was unwell and wasn't sure if I was contagious. I think that's why he thought I was being distant but I had made it clear that I just didn't want him to catch whatever I have. \n\nI also told him which cabinet I'd keep them in so that packets wouldn't be laying around making him sick or feel triggered by it.\n\nAlso the reason I waited to call him was because I knew he wouldn't be awake yet and I didn't want to wake him with my call.\n\nHope this clears some things up.", "I have never heard of kissing or sex being dangerous wrt to antibiotic allergies.

You\u2019re NTA, but his treatment of you is unacceptable. Get gone and stay gone.", "He's dangerous. Anyone who says to go off prescribed antibiotics for an infection is not someone who cares about you.", "Yeah, if your parents don't mind, you should stay there for a while to get healthy, and then figure out what you should do from there. People are right that his attitude is not healthy, as he showing some possessive tendencies, as in telling you what you are allowed to do. Good luck to you, and hope you feel better.", "Yeah I was thinking that too. I'm also allergic and so long as I don't take it, I'm fine!\n\nI can even handle it with gloves (I work in science and have had to for work).\n\nHowever, I didn't want to cast judgement on that because, although I've never heard of one that severe to penicillin, there can be variation in severity of allergies.\n\nBesides, whether or not he is really that allergic, there are so many other red flags in his behavior so it didn't seem like the most important thing to address!", "Wait, what?

That's how my penicillin allergy is.\n\nHowever, I didn't want to get into an argument about the variation in allergy severity, because that's really not the biggest issue here!\n\nWhether he is or isn't that deathly allergic, the problem is how he reacted to the situation.", "[deleted]", "I was just on the phone with a close relative who's an MD and explained your situation.

He's more at risk from moldy bread than from pills in a bottle merely existing in his home.", "He should talk to a doctor - an actual MD, not a PA or NP or holistic \"doctor\" - about this. \n\nIf he really is *that* allergic, the doctor can help him come up with strategies to deal with it, because I **guarantee** that he has been the same room and probably pretty close physically to people who were taking penicillin, and he didn't even know it.\n\nBut you were legitimately sick and taking pain meds will **not** cure what antibiotics will. If you had stopped taking them, you might have become seriously ill.\n\nHe sounds like a headcase. And a selfish jerk", "Ok. NTA and he's being dramatic. If he doesn't have an epi pen, he's not allergic. He probably got a rash. Like I do. Technically, a rash etc is an allergic reaction but you need to go home and take your meds.

If I were your friend, I'd tell you he just failed at being the right guy for you.", "Having the medication around in a cabinet isn\u2019t going to do anything for his allergies unless he ingests it by mistake. He either doesn\u2019t know shit about his own allergy, or he\u2019s being purposefully difficult to be controlling. Honestly I feel it\u2019s the latter because if somehow he allergy was truly THAT severe (again, not really possible though) then he\u2019d be wanting you to stay at your parents\u2019 house for his safety.", "Yeah, bacteria can be deadly. If they get into your blood, it can be game over pretty quickly.\n\nBut they aren't really feared that much right now because we have antibiotics to deal with them, but because they aren't a big deal.\n\nMy only question about the bf is if he's just an idiot in addition to being a controlling asshole, or if he's deliberately trying to hurt OP (while still being a controlling asshole).", "[deleted]", "Yes, you are very confused.

I'm severely allergic to amoxicillin and my mother is deathly allergic to penicillin. We don't have epi-pens.
