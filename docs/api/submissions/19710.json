I had no problem with taking this but I did know that Jake is allergic to penicillin. \n\nOnce I got my meds I called him to tell him where I would keep it so that he can stay away from it. He told me that it couldn't be in the apartment and I can't take it around him because he was deathly allergic to it.\nHe said I should get rid of it and take pain meds to get better on my own instead. I suggested that I could go stay at my parents house for the next few days whilst I'm taking my meds.\n\nHe said that we'd talk about it when he got home, but until then I either needed to get rid of them or leave them in my car without taking them. But I didn't want to wait 7 hours for him to come home before taking them. \n\nI decided to just go to my parents house because I wanted to take them, and I'd probably end up going there later after we talked.\n\nWhen I got to my parents, I stayed in bed for the rest of the day and fell asleep at some point. I woke up around 5am to loads of calls and texts from Jake and some mutual friends asking where I was.\n\nI waited a while before calling Jake back and he asked where I was and when I answered he angrily told me that it was disrespectful of me to leave without waiting for him to discuss this and that I was making a big situation by ignoring his calls last night. \n\nI tried to explain to him that I wasn't ignoring him, that I'm sick and I had fallen asleep at my parents and that I didn't think it would be a big deal because I had already suggested it on the phone to him yesterday.\n\nHe said that he didn't remember me telling him this, and that he was calling friends all last night asking if they knew where I was and that it was suspicious that I had been distant with him for the past few weeks just to dissappear last night. \n\nI may be the AH for this part, but I told him that it's not my fault that he didn't remember me telling him this, and that he knew I had been feeling unwell over the past few weeks which explains why I was distant. I then said that he was the one being ridiculous as there was no way that having penicillin in the same apartment as him would even cause any problems if he stayed away from it.\n\nAfter this he said that I was being TA for belittling him and not taking his allergies seriously. He then told me to just stay at my parents for the next while until he's ready to talk again before hanging up, and he's not answered any of my calls since. \n\nAs I've been stuck in bed thinking about it, part of me just feels like I might have been too stubborn and I could have avoided all of this by waiting the couple of hours or trying to get better without the antibiotics. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686786849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149n447/aita_22f_for_choosing_to_take_meds_that_my_bf_27m/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How he said that he was calling friends because he was suspicious.

Give up the antibiotic and just suffer it out with pain meds? How can he not understand the reasoning behind antibiotics, prescribed to kill bacteria in the body VS medication to lessen pain from a ton of possibilities. \n\nAllergic response to someone else taking a medication he is allergic to seems pretty sketchy. I am going off of my personal experience of raising a child who is anaphylactic to peanuts, but unless someone has recently eaten something with peanuts and then exchanges saliva, and thus sharing the peanut protein, there is no way in hell my kiddo is going to have any symptoms. I know this from all of the peanut butter I have digested when he wasn\u2019t around. There are people who have an allergy severe enough that airborne bits can trigger a reaction but they are pretty rare. \n\nDoes your bf have an epi pen for his severe allergy? I would ask what happens if he digests the medication as well as what happened to lead to the diagnosis. Medication allergies are often really medication intolerance. I have a couple of drugs that give me abdominal issues & stomach pains that make me think I\u2019m dying. I also have a drug that causes severe itching and hives all over my body. Cats make me wheeze and itch, fresh cut grass too, those are symptoms of an allergy. If he doesn\u2019t have an epi pen then his tantrum is either unwarranted because he isn\u2019t being truthful, he is trying to make it look worse than it is, and/or he is horribly irresponsible. \u201cThis can kill me but I\u2019m not going to keep the meds that could potentially save my life\u201d\n\nYou need to stay away until he is ready to talk to you?

You know, the doctor asks you if you're allergic to anything. If you say no, they don't ask you if anyone in your household is, because it doesn't matter.

What he's asked you to do and his reaction to you staying at your parents' place are absolutely insane. There is absolutely no justification for that.

As long as you wash your hands after touching the capsules and don't aggressively make out right after you take it then he'll be fine. His concern is unfounded and if he was really that concerned he should've reached out to his doctor or another medical professional for guidance regarding his allergy and you taking Penicillin.\n\n\n\n2. Pain meds don't cure infections, they're there to provide temporary symptom relief. Considering you've been sick for weeks, taking some Tylenol and hoping you get better doesn't cut it. Why would you listen to your bf instead of someone that went to school for over a decade to become a medical doctor?\n\n\n\n\n3. The fact that you already knew that talking with him rationally wouldn't work so you just went to your parents house is not a major red flag for *his* behavior. If you can't even have a conversation with your partner because you know he'll shut you down that makes your bf seem very disrespectful and controlling.\n\n\n\n\n4. He didn't forget that you talked to him about going to your parent's house nor was he genuinely worried about your safety. He was upset that instead of bending to his will, throwing out the antibiotics, and staying sick you chose to not let him control you. He's gaslighting you into feeling bad by lying about forgetting your conversation then roped your friends in with lies to further isolate you and make you question your sanity. I can guarantee you that the story he told his friends is VERY different than what actually happened.\n\n\n\n\n5. You weren't belittling him, he's just upset because he can't control you. Unless you're leaving significant details out of this post, in no way did you belittle or invalidate his feelings.\n\n\n\n\n6. Him saying you don't care about his allergy is a manipulation tactic. Obviously, you care about his allergy. You offered the compromise of staying at your parent's house while taking the antibiotics and apparently that wasn't good enough for him. Also, refer back to my first point - if he was that worried about his allergy then he should've reached out to a medical professional for guidance. The fact that he refused your compromise only to turn around and falsely claim that you don't care about him is even more evidence that this isn't about his allergy, it's about him controlling you.\n\n\n\nI could keep listing even more shitty and manipulative behaviors your bf is engaging in, but that would make this comment even longer than it already is.
