How do you get so worked up over a scenario you made up? Nothing in the OP indicates that the dog was tormented or about to bite this child.", "Yes, I can read.", "And some dogs don't give warnings at all.    \n\nAnd you usually don't find that out until it's too late.\n\nThe kid and the dog should have been separated after the first pestering.   Or prior to that if OP was not sure how the dog would react around children.", "But if you know the child is pestering the dog you can just remove the dog b4 any warnings happen.\n\nDogs can just go straight to biting b4 warning and dachshund are pretty aggressive (it's true).\n\nESH both parties needed to deal with the situation and neither did anything about it except wait for someone to possibly get hurt", "That's because u never made a safe place for them that's the problem and ur not understanding me.\n\nI have a dog too, he sleeps wherever the fk he wants he sleeps like a king for how many blankets we have on the floor or couch he doesn't sleep on the dog bed.\n\nBut ever since he was a puppy we made sure he knew his crate was a lace to hide and relax, we even have a blanket over it because he likes it dark, so when we have guests which he is a very nervous guy with strangers he has a place to hide away in another room undisturbed.\n\nUr dogs will not feel punished but you are making them feel like it is, providing treats and their favopillows and blankets can easily solve this and doing it anytime will let them know hey this place is nice and peaceful", "Hence the ESH", "I have a fluffy mini American shepherd who is child bait. Sadly, she thinks children are small sheep that need to herded. When they want to hug her, I just have to say nope. If mom or dad ignore me, little one will be charged by a mini American. She doesn't bite either.", "Likely OP knew their dog wasn't one of those.

My girl, she\u2019s more hesitant around people but adores children (my nephew loves her too lol). \nAlso, 3 isn\u2019t too young, or if that\u2019s the case, maybe mom should have been paying more attention to her own kid. You weren\u2019t harsh at all, though to avoid that situation again, just tell your friend to hang on to her kiddo or move the dog into a different room/away.", "NTA-\n\n1. you warned him multiple times, while within earshot of your friend so she was in the room and right next to the situation. it's not your fault that she did nothing. \n2. your dog is perfectly behaved but every dog has a limit that shouldn't be tested. \n3. you're right, your friend should've controlled her son better or took him away from the dog when he wasn't listening.", "NTA Weird, ppl saying the dog should be put down? For snapping, not even biting? More so, even if the dog DID bite, STILL not your fault. You warned the mom, you warned the kid. And shame on the mother for 1. Not stepping in and 2. Not teaching her child how to behave around dogs. LUCKY your dog didn't bite and LUCKY that your dog is a small dog and not a pit bull or German shepherd", "NTA. When I was a kid I messed with peoples cats cause I wanted to play with them but I got a scratch from one of the cats and learnt to not be so hard with them. \n\n\nSome things are learnt the hard way.

It was literally the worst day of my life. You both have responsibility to take action but you are only responsible for your dog. If you ever see your dog get aggressive, remove it. That's your duty and if you don't want to get sued, do it. Should she have reprimanded her child? Yes. Are you both being irresponsible? Yup. Take it seriously. You never think it will happen to you until it does. ESH.", "ESH. After the second warning you gave, the dog should have been put in another room/outside. I had to do that when our toddler niece wouldn\u2019t listen, and my dog didn\u2019t even react to her like yours did. You don\u2019t want it to get to that point.\n\nThe mom sucks also for not correcting her kid, or interjecting at all.", "Soft ESH - though on the fence, since I think the mom has the most responsibility here. \n\nThat said, you saw the kid was bothering your dog, but didn\u2019t take action before it became significant enough for him to express his discomfort.  **You can\u2019t rely on other people to respect your dog\u2019s boundaries - that responsibility lies with you, regardless of the location/circumstances**\n\nThe kid\u2019s mom is a total AH for not teaching her kid not to pester dogs and allowing him to keep doing it - but since you can\u2019t control your friend\u2019s kid, you could have done a better job of removing your dog from the situation before it escalated. \n\nWith a dog that\u2019s small enough to pick up, you should have just moved your dog away from the kid so that the kid couldn\u2019t keep pestering him.", "I'm leaning towards an ESH vote, because you're friend absolutely should have been monitoring her kid. And if you noticed your dog getting agitated and your friend not parenting their child, you should have just moved your dog or ask your friend to leave before it escalated. Neither of you should have let it get to the point it did.\n\nKids are gonna do stuff like that, especially when their parent isn't setting boundaries. And dogs are gonna do stuff like that, when their owners aren't advocating for their boundaries.", "NTA, but here is sone advice. Dachshunds are biters, it's just normal for them, and three is plenty old to obey. Next time they come over, please have a crate or safe room for your dog. And let your friend know that you will not tolerate her being a bad parent at your house. You will control and protect your child, and she will do the same. Period", "Nta you told the child multiple times and his mom stood there looking stupid. That\u2019s the moms fault, grab your baby what did she think would happen after being warned multiple times", "ESH : your friend for not being an attentive parent and you for being another entitled stupid dog owner.", "My dog never growled or bit anyone,but when I had small visitors I picked him up,put him on my bed and closed the door. No way was I going to just hope he was ok with young kids. Better safe than sorry.", "NTA", "ESH parents need to control their toddlers but likewise you should protect the dog more. As someone with 2 dogs and a 2 year old when she's being a terror and won't leave the dogs alone, we separate them before it gets to the snapping point, by not doing this your setting the dog up to fail.", "I have a pitbull. He's a great dog and I've never had any issue with him. That being said, if someone brought their kid over I would absolutely not let the kid pester my dog, and at the first sign of my dog being uncomfortable I would ask the parent to keep their kid away from the dog. If they weren't doing that I would be my dog in another room or ask the person to leave. \n\nI also had 3 doxins growing up. These dogs are bred to be fearless terretorial and protective. Most are not good with little kids that they are not familiar with as you obviously have learned. You should have removed the kid or the dog from the situation well before the dog snapped.", "Even before the edits and clarifications, absolutely NTA. You told the child not to pester your dog. He ignored you. More to the point, his mother ignored you. And even then, your dog only exhibited warning behaviour. \n\nYour friend needs to watch her child more. Even if he's only a baby he still needs to learn that some things are dangerous, and that can NEVER happen too young.", "NTA - Fuck them kids.", "NTA. You don't relinquish responsibility for your kid when you step into someone else's home. The owner of that home doesn't suddenly become responsible for your kid when it steps into the house. No parent should ever let their child touch or try to play with any animal without explicit permission from the owner. This is on the parent.", "ESH. Friend A should have used the moment to teach correct behavior around animals. Not very responsible to just let the 3 year old antagonize a dog. OP should have removed the dog when she noticed the interaction wasn't going well. The child is 3 that is too young to be expecting them to listen or understand cause/effect very well. I'd remove the dog or the child to prevent anything from happening.", "Your vote counts as y- t- a just saying bc that\u2019s what you typed lol", "We were on a boat trip once with our dog. Some random dude kept bothering and not listening to us while she growled.

Absolutely not her friend should\u2019ve grabbed her baby, she told the baby to stop and his mom didn\u2019t intervene (who the child obviously would see as the authority figure) this is solely the moms fault and I don\u2019t see how you can see it any differently", "I don\u2019t understand your post.", "You\u2019re still leaving your dog in a stressed situation then though.

You *can* control whether your dog is going to be subjected to A\u2019s kid by removing the dog from the situation. \n\nThat\u2019s not punishing the dog.

Neither the dog or small child is at fault", "So you typed in the letters Y T A which means your vote is saying you think the original poster is an asshole and it will be counted as such. To change that edit your original comment to say NTA with the letters together so that your vote is saying she is not the asshole of this situation", "No, she knew the child was annoying the dog, that's why she gave the child w warnings. The thing is if the child didn't stop and the mother didn't help she should have asked her guests to leave or separated the two.

He called the dog's name and it attacked. There is no such thing as \"their dog wasn't one of those.\" \n\nI take this safety seriously.

You can own heelers or any dogs for as long as you say there is always something new to learn and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nI had dogs longer then you and I still learn everyday", "Yeah, thanks, but I\u2019m also not gonna stress about the opinion of someone on Reddit that wants to critique my handling of my dogs but can\u2019t be bothered to spell out easy or before or you\u2019re"]}
