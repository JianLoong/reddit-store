That means this child could be any age at all but is likely older than a toddler but younger than double digits.", "Short of your dog biting I say it's mom's responsibility.\n\nNTA", "About the wine but it's pretty clear neither of you actually did anything about the kid or the dog.", "Sure I gave an excuse for your lack of care for those under your care, doesn't mean you didn't do shit", "Someone could take some Street justice out of your dog... ffs the mental gymnastics in this thread", "Never any problems with children or other dogs. She absolutely hates the mail man but just growls from a safe distance.", "& then the kid would\u2019ve acting learned not to terrorize the helpless animal", "Exactly. What kind of dog/pet owner just stands there and waits and watches for a catastrophe to happen? This situation wasn't fair for neither the dog nor the child. \n\nWho would willingly risk a bite record for their dog? That's so irresponsible.\nIt's insane that people think that just because it might be a small breed or the dog is old that they are not responsible and absolve them from any consequences.", "> it could face euthanasia.\n\nNo. That's not a thing where I live.", "Have you ever seen a 10 year old dog? I had a dachshund that lived to 9 and he was slow and old and missing teeth. He was also an absolute bastard that is missed dearly, but that's a different story.", "I had three dachshunds over the years, mostly when I was a teenager at my parents. I never found them to be aggressive. Although my first one did bark at a police K-9 one time lol.", "I can tell you as a former vet tech I was bitten five times. Three times were by dachshunds.\n\nThey\u2019re intense little guys.", "Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m not going to rely on anyone being able to fully control a toddler.", "OP said they interfered, even physically, twice.", "We must be from different parts of town.", "And that includes small children that are less aware of boundaries and personal space? They tend to be the challenge more than older ones", "And the dog would be pts. Not worth the risk she should have moved the dog", "Yeah, seriously. After the kid continued ONCE after being told to stop, I would have removed the dog or asked the guest to leave. But no, gotta let the kid stress out the dog \"multiple\" times. How caring.", "Your from the UK it is. If the dog is proven to be a risk to people it can be pts. And you can go to prison. Its not only for resticted breeds they usually kill if they bite thats way they are pts.", "Oh well, perfectly fine to let the kid clearly not listening to keep stressing your dog, because all responsibility falls to THE THREE YEAR OLD.", "Your dog really said \"fuck the police\" lmao", "I don't recall where I heard the theory but someone mentioned that little dogs often don't get trained properly because you can just pick them up. That, according to whatever the source was, leads them to protect their bodily autonomy by being aggressive.", "OP already answered your question.", "That's not true, unless it's a specific breed."]}
