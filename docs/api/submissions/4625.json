Go no contact with her", "NTA. Why would she mention she\u2019s your mom\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Let her actions lead to their natural consequences. You can't steal cart fulls of stuff and not expect to get arrested. Your mom sounds like she could use some time in jail. Personally I hate thieves and feel she deserves what she gets.", "NTA.", "Bro if they didn't want her to know they wouldn't have told you. Not everything is exactly as people claim it. Someone really came up to you and says \"hey. See this picture of your mom stealing? Next time she comes in we're going to arrest her.\" But what they didn't say was \"I am not supposed to tell you because I am paid to have her arrested. You need to tell YOUR MOTHER not to come in, but if I tell you that I could lose my job\" but that's what they fucking meant. They said wink wink nudge nudge don't tell your mom WE WILL ARREST HER IF SHE COMES BACK and you didn't even get fired for that shit. Come on bro. Don't be daft.", "NTA... let her face consequences of her actions.", "Your bosses are offering you a noose to see if you will put your head through it. \n\nDO NOT warn your mom. If you do, it is proof enough for your bosses that you are helping her. Not only you will be fired on the spot but you will also be accused of theft.", "YWNBTA \n\nI would still be inclined too give her a warning (without leaving a digital trail or any sort of evidence of having given that warning) as those charges can cause serious consequences, and the legal system is brutally punitive to those who get a record. I would choose family over our f'ed up legal system. Put another way, it will not benefit you to have a family member in jail, but associated costs/expenses or related issues may find their way to you as a result.\n\nUltimately though, she is responsible for her actions and the consequences thereof.\nDo take care to not legally endanger yourself in the process", "Nope. Don't warn her either, or you probably would lose your job.", "NTA. She is a thief, and she does not care if she ruins your job, reputation, life. Tell security that you will happily let them arrest her.", "NTA - Actions have consequences. \n\nYou have done nothing wrong. Now is your opportunity to help prove it. \n\nYour mother \u201cdug her own grave\u201d.", "INFO: is there a mental health issue here?", "NTA\n\nYou wouldn't be the AH if you baited your mother into the store so that she could be arrested.", "You would be the asshole if you *did* warn her.\n\nShe stole the bedsheets and the matress; let her lie on it.", "This might be sadistic, but I would be like \"hey mom can you drive me to work today ill give you my discount\" \n\nI mean she's gonna get arrested anyways \ud83e\udd37\n\nAlso are they not allowed to just call the police? (I'm sorta stupid lol idk)\n\nNTA", "NTA and do not warn her.  She's not only stealing from the company, but putting you at risk as well.  \n\nSAY NOTHING.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s made her own bed. Let her lie in it and going NC seems like the best route with this one", "NTA but i personally think you should warn her", "NTA for not telling her because you would ABSOLUTELY be her accomplice and deserving of being fired if you warned her. Don't be stupid.\n\nETA: BTW u/TheInfamousElGuapo you do realize that *unless* you're in a small town with only a few stores that she was completely targeting **your** store this whole time **ON PURPOSE** so she could use you as a throwaway resource if she got caught, *exactly like she just did.*", "Ugh. But also exactly - why should OP suffer from the consequences of their mother's actions?", "It isn't really an option either as not warning her is what will save OPs job. If the mother never returns they'll think OP warned her and there'll always be a cloud. \n\nOP should express that they aren't close at all and they'll let things happen as they will. There'll be consequences but it's unlikely shoplifting will result in jail time, so it'll be a good learning experience for OPs mum hopefully.", "Most stores no longer confront shoplifters due to the increased dangers of it becoming violent. Most places will collect evidence and wait for whatever the amount it is to make felony charges. My local Lowe\u2019s does this, once you\u2019ve stolen $10,000 worth they turn you over for felony charges. My uncle works there and told me the policy.  When I worked at the local mall you have to notify security to confront them, store employees are not allowed again due to danger it\u2019s mall policy. And store caught breaking it will be given a written warning for first time & next time it\u2019s a fine, after so many they will hold a meeting to determine revoking your lease.", "So this AH gets away with stealing from a store all because she knows OP?", "What an ice cold take you got there", "$3000 up is a felony. The loss prevention team keeps track to build the felony case.", "How would that get you arrested?? Some store security told me something and now I have to legally obey it? Do you not know how the law works? This ain\u2019t murder one, no one is going to arrest the daughter and pull phone records for store items. Sometimes I watch these Netflix specials where detectives take advantage of people who have not even the simplest understanding of the law and it\u2019s hard to believe until I scroll through a comment section like this.", "\"Don't come back and steal, they might arrest you\"", "Wouldn't that be for theft where they just walk/run out? I have never worked in a business that says to someone they can leave and come back later to pay for goods. She had to engage with someone for that...", "That's gonna get YOU arrested."]}
