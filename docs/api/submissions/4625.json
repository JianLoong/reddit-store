It\u2019s also a huge safety violation in most retailers to leave the store to chase after a shoplifter. You can be fired in some places for chasing after someone. \n\nWhere it does become complicated is *after* the initial interview when the cops escort the shoplifter away and the retailer agrees to press charges. \n\nI have a feeling that the mom is going to *sing* about how she went to the store whenever OP was *not* scheduled to work, implying that mom had knowledge of OP\u2019s schedule when OP doesn\u2019t have any obligation to provide their schedule to their mom. The retailer may be adjusting OP\u2019s schedule to create opportunities to entice the mom to come back and shop when OP isn\u2019t scheduled to work. \n\nJust saying this because I\u2019ve worked management in big box stores many, many years ago in college and worked closely with these specific AP/LP people who were some of the most vindictive people I\u2019ve ever met.", "I think its a spam bot", "I worked LP for years, i would absolutely do my due diligence in investigating OPs potential involvement.
