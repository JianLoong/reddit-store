Why was she divorced so many times? He needs to be able to weigh that information to make sure he wants to take a chance on being married to someone with so many divorces on her belt. It could be an indication that she is a bad communicator, a cheater, not willing to work on a marriage when times get tough, etc. Worst-case scenario, there are plenty of con artists out there who are willing to marry someone, then file for divorce to make a profit. There are also *other* things it can imply, like that she has had a history of men doing any of the above things to her, and that she had thought she had found \"the one\" each time, only to be mistreated and find out she hadn't. It could be anything.

Definitely tell him because who knows what she\u2019s hiding. I\u2019m surprised people are voting yta. Marriages are a big deal despite what people think. 6 relationships? Not a big deal. To every1 when that thinks marriage is minimal. Marry your SO each and every1 and then divorce when you\u2019ve broken up .

Kind of unrelated, but saying \"Till death do us part\" six times and still going to church seems like such a weird combination.\n\nI'd be suss of anyone married over 2 times.
