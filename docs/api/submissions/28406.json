If OP feels that they must get to the bottom of this, why isn\u2019t OP asking her out to coffee or taking her aside at a social event and bringing this up as a \u201chey- this is what people are saying about you - what is this about?\u201d Hearing things about people through the grapevine and taking it as truth, and then sending her a text message and giving her an ultimatum and threatening her is out of control. This woman might be in OPs family, claims they knew her before, and OP is already potentially burning a bridge over gossip. \n\nAlso - I\u2019m sure there are women who are professional divorcees, but there\u2019s also men who do that too. Like in my grandmothers past where a man married her and tried financially draining her. What if the FIL is doing this to her? We don\u2019t know this and OP doesn\u2019t know this. What if those 6 marriages were because of the men trying to gain from her and she was a young hopeless romantic? Maybe that\u2019s why she took a 20 year hiatus since she was scarred by men. OP doesn\u2019t know this nor has he tried to learn the truth either. Instead, OP is quick to judge and thinks they are being a knight in shining armor by threatening her. Why is everyone assuming that since she is a woman with multiple marriages she MUST be the problem? \n\nSaying she had 6 marriages in a short time span is also proving my point about the stigma.", "If any of the marriages were annulled that means they never happened. There\u2019s nothing to disclose. We also don\u2019t know if she was under see some sort of pressure to enter into these marriages. Not every marriage starts with \u201cI love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you, let\u2019s get married\u201d. Some marriages are entered into under religious pressure, family pressure, abuse etc. \n\nI believe her FIL has the right to know about all of her divorces. However OP should do some investigating to find out if these rumors are true and if they were legally valid marriages.", "Maybe she's just afraid of judgement. If that's the case, I can see why she would hide that fact from most people. You hear someone was married that many times and suddenly you're very curious to know what went wrong. HOWEVER it's not ok to hide that from someone you intend to marry. MAYBE she's terrified of having another failed marriage, but, with that attitude, it's a self fulfilling prophecy.", "OP that\u2019s a huge red flag. She\u2019s not just lying by omission, but actively deceiving your FIL. You have to ask yourself why? That\u2019s definitely suspect.", "Maybe she's divorced twice widowed four times?", "Y'all have great taste in music - just sayin'!", "I started singing that song in my head as soon as I read the post", "Eh, I think there's grey areas - my uncle was divorced 3 times by I think 35? He was *not* a good or stable person as a young adult, his third marriage was the one that lasted longest but she wasn't that great either.\n\nHe has seriously turned his life around, remarried a 4th time at 50something, they've been together almost 20 years now and are very happy. Some people take a lot of time and some bad stuff to actually become mature and decent.\n\nBut he was also honest with her about his past relationships from what I can tell - actively omitting *six* previous marriages is a pretty massive red flag.", "My grandma married 7 times, some of her marriages were to protect my dad and uncle. Some was to protect her or her friends.\n\nThe truth is he doesn\u2019t know for sure it was 6x he knows she was divorced and believed church gossip that it was 6. Some of those \u201cdivorces\u201d could be to protect someone, annulments, or because she was forced due to religion/family.\n\nYes, the FIL needs to know but OP is being an asshole. What he should have done was ask for context of the rumor then gage from there. He is choosing to believe gossip.", "That wouldn\u02bbt be a non-starter for me. I\u02bbd want more information on what happened and, if it was clear that they were a large part of the problem, what they had done to fix their behavior. \n\nI can easily see the situation of an early first marriage that failed. Then a second longterm marriage that eventually failed.", "Yeah there is a reason that people get divorced the best partners usually stay married .\n\nI have the same rule except for I will only get married once and I am done, my wife and I discussed this at length because my mom has been married 9 times and it took me 4 years to propose but I discussed that this is a forever thing and I won\u2019t ever marry someone else again even if she decides to leave and she agreed that we are taking vows to ourselves society and god that we are partners forever .", "If it was a religious contract, you wouldn't have to get a marriage license from the government. \n\nIt's a LEGAL contract. Adding bullshit religious stuff to it doesn't change that.", "You can go ahead and switch \"sacred for most people\" to \"sacred to me\". No need to speak for so many people you know nothing about.\nAlso, tried to Google the study you were referencing and it is no where to be found. Was this a humorous op Ed in Reader's digest?\" Would love to actually read it and see how on earth they came up with such a ridiculous prediction and conclusion.", "In Virginia you have to list the number of previous marriages on your license.", "Why would she be widowed so many times, that would be weird af as well.", "There\u2019s a clear difference between a one night stand and a marriage though, and acting otherwise is being disingenuous at best. Plus plenty of partners do disclose all past relationships to each other.", "I know reddit is delulu in this regard, but knowing someone's body count is pretty normal thing to know in a serious relationship for people who are not chronically online.", "Except that we are not talking about just some relationship, are we?\n\nThat\u2019s six marriages. Kind of a big deal.", "You can't divorce dead people so there's that", "I get it, but your uncle was the exception and even he took it to number 4.\n\nMy uncle is on number 6. \nMy friends mom, number 10.", "I guess age makes a mitigation factor. My age of 31? Nah either they are the problem or they can't pick em.", "For HIM it matters, just because you see it as a piece of paper doesn\u2019t mean you need to be an ass", "Depends on the state. Mine just asks if you have been married prior and asked if you had court documentation letting you know you\u2019re legally divorced but doesn\u2019t ask for it because that\u2019s already in their system.", "OP doesn't use the word \"divorce.\"", "\u2026number 10??", "Oh I agree he's the exception! I just think an absolute blanket rule like that is ignoring a lot of potential nuance.", "Well no, for him it's \" most people\". Didn't you see the study he quoted for reasons that don't relate to his point?", "Oooooooo", "True..but the chances of 5 of her husbands dying more than 20 years ago\u2026say her first was at age 18 and she\u2019s now 65\u2026then she was married and then not 6 times by age 45 or so\u2026anyway while that\u2019s a possibility I would guess the likelihood of it happening is pretty darned close to zero. This\u2026at least some were divorces and with that many it\u2019s highly likely that at least 5 of them were divorces. And definitely NTA.", "Yeah...", "I put there could be mitiging factors.", "For marriage 2, you have to show the divorce decree for #1. For #3, you have to show the decree for #2, for #4 the decree for #3, and so on. I can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d have to show ALL the decrees every time because you can\u2019t get the license each time without having proved the most recent marriage ended", "I don't think anyone needed to be told the likelihood of having 6 husbands die.", "It's a low likelihood, but it could be possible if she married active duty military men.", "Well that would really depend on the age of her husbands. If she married one every 5 years ever since she turned 18 but THEY were all in the 80+ range... I'd say she could have been widowed 6 times even without any foul play.", "How do they have the energy \ud83d\ude2d", "It depends on where you live. My state wants to see everything", "There\u2019s an awful lot of discussion about divorces not being mentioned\u2026and that they might have died\u2026so a little let\u2019s see seemed appropriate.", "Idk\nBut as my friend liked to say, only 2 of them died", "I can tell you, it's her job. That's how she pays her bills, from divorce settlements. I've literally heard of women like that and know 2 men who married women that had 3-4 divorces on their back, they try jumping from guy to another and get squeeze out as much as they can from them.\n\nIt's not super common, but it's still kinda weird it's allowed to happen, they are basically scam artists and it's legal for them to do it.", "I don't know about energy but they must love wedding cake and have the minister on speed dial \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, I get that some places have different policies. Just seems counterintuitive to me", "I never even thought of that, you\u2019re spot on. That\u2019s wild and sounds like such an emotional headache??"]}
