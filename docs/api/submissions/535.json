You didn't sell the ticket. You said you'd take the hit for the ticket, so you take the hit for the ticket. \n\nHer mom doesn't have to buy the ticket because her mom didn't agree to go on the basis she was paying $400 for it. If you'd found someone to pay for it, her mom wouldn't have gone.\n\nIf you wanted to do something else with the ticket it was on you to make that happen with Rebecca.", "YTA. No one bought it. No one was going to buy it. You\u2019re not entitled to your money back when you canceled so last minute and left your friend hanging. $400 plus hotel $$ is a crazy amount to spend on something you don\u2019t even really feel like doing but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\nETA: you say that she had to take her mom or else she couldn\u2019t go\u2026 did you agree to be the one driving you both to the show? Because that doubly makes YTA.", "I mean, yeah, yta on this one. It is the equivalent of no one buying the ticket. Your friend just took her mom so she wouldn't have to go alone. You'll have to take the loss on this one because, by your own words, you ditched. Doesn't matter if you think your other friend is more important, you still bailed on plans you already made. Why even buy a ticket if you didn't want to go in the first place?  Take it as a learning experience and 1, be more honest from the get go next time or 2, don't bail on plans you've already made especially when travel is involved.", "Hmm, i think im leaning towards YTA. One you paid for the ticket and didn't turn up, so you have to take the loss of it, if you managed to find someone to sell the ticket to, then that's when you get your money back, but you didn't, so yeah, YTA.", "YTA because you ditched your friend when you had plans to go to the concert together. You are also TA for trying to get her to pay for a ticket that you couldn't sell after you ditched your friend.\n\nYour friend that came home from the mission is going to be home for a while and you could have waited to see that friend in order to go to the concert, but you chose not to because you wanted to go to the big party they throw when a mormon comes home from their mission.", "YTA if you think she should pay you back. You ditched her and if you didn't want to go from the beginning, why make the plan? Too bad if someone else used it. You broke your promise so she made due. Also YTA for breaking your promise. Don't promise if you don't intend to go. That this guy showing up was your excuse to ditch. You were planning to ditch her long before he showed up. Maybe she will smarten up and ditch you as a friend.", "YTA", "YTA. You told her you\u2019d take the hit if you couldn\u2019t sell it, and you couldn\u2019t.", "YTA- for the simple fact that you said you would do something and you bailed. You are not a reliable friend", "You're not the AH for ditching, but I think you have no right to demand compensation for a ticket you were unable to sell.  YTA for that.", "I\u2019m leaning towards ESH. It wasn\u2019t really cool to abandon your plans somewhat close to the concert, but from the sounds of it, you had communicated your intention to do so at least a week in advance.\n\nYou did say you\u2019d take the hit on the ticket if you couldn\u2019t sell it in time, but that shouldn\u2019t mean that your friend gets to use it without even asking you if she can, since you paid for it. Not really sure how others in this thread are perfectly fine with your friend basically using your money without even having the decency to ask you, just because you cancelled your plans.\n\nMy real question is, why in the world would you pay $400 for a ticket + a hotel to a concert you didn\u2019t even want to go to? That\u2019s an insanely high money and time commitment for something you weren\u2019t very interested in in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rebecca didn\u2019t own the ticket to give away since you paid her for it and her Mom should have paid to use it.  It\u2019s basically stealing since it wasn\u2019t theirs to use", "INFO, what were you planning to do with the ticket? And more importantly, did you tell Rebecca about your plans for the ticket? Another is when did you notice Rebecca that you're not going? If it's D-1 then I believe it'll be a whole different matter.\n\nFor now, I'm going with ESH. TA for Rebecca for taking the ticket without asking you first. And gentle YTA for you because well, if Rebecca was truly a dear childhood friend, surely you would've known her parents well, I'm not saying that the right move was to just gift her mother the ticket outrightly, while I see no problem in that, I'd believe not everyone would be okay with that, it is a nice gift for a friend, no? Also depending on when you cancelled the plans with Rebecca, you'd be even more of YTA if it was a day or so before the concert.\n\nI believe a good move would've been to communicate it directly, *before* the concert of what you wanted to do with the ticket to Rebecca. Perhaps a discounted ticket for the mother. And really, if you didn't want to go why not just tell Rebecca directly? No need for this fiasco to even happen in the first place.", "No, sorry when I said \u201ccouldn\u2019t go\u201d I should have said didn\u2019t want to.
