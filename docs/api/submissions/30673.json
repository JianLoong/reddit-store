{"id": 30673, "submission_id": "17rodsg", "title": "AITA For evicting my friend out of my condo after they complained about the state of the condo despite not paying rent?", "selftext": "Mid to late September my friend was talking about how she was getting in a bad situation with her boyfriend, and was thinking about moving back to the area I live in, but wasn\u2019t sure if she could manage because she doesn't have a consistent job and no money currently. Wanting to offer her a way out of a bad situation, I offered for her to stay at my Condo and eventually rent it since I had already moved out and was living with my partner, and planned to rent the Condo anyways.   \nNothing gets finalized and a week or so later she decides to not break up with him, but due to their lease being up soon still wants to move out here and rent out the Condo, even offering to do renovations at some point when they can afford it. I figured this would be a good idea, despite knowing they might not be able to pay right away, it was better than a total stranger.   \nI explained multiple times that I was living with my partner in a 400 sqft studio, and would have to leave some things there until we were able to move in November. This worked out because they needed a bed, and wanted me to leave other furniture for them to use. However, come October she starts taking a week or more to reply, and keeps pushing the move date back, finally moving out LATE October only telling me the morning of leaving no time to finalize a lease or go over more details, despite me saying I needed better communication.  \nEverything is fine for a few days, but she starts to complain about things (keep in mind they have not, and are not planning on paying anytime soon). She asked me if I could move a piece of furniture out since the drawers were full, and I reminded her I did not have the space and it would have to wait until mid November. I finally get the lease over and she sees I requested a $500 security deposit, and flips out on me saying we never talked about this, and that the Condo is a mess, I didn\u2019t finish painting, there\u2019s no room for her and they have no storage, etc\u2026 Everything is things I have discussed with her before and warned her about, and by no means in the Condo a mess. I left a few more things than I anticipated but again\u2026 they weren\u2019t paying and I didn\u2019t want to pay for a storage unit yet.  \nI decided to evict them anticipating more issues down the line with them. Immediately they start calling saying I\u2019m unprofessional, that she's having panic attacks, and the next day I get a long message saying she hopes this doesn't ruin our friendship and she hopes we can work it out etc\u2026 a complete flip from them not even replying to me a few days before and being so rude.   \nI feel bad because I know they don\u2019t have money, and while I\u2019m open to mediation in the future, I signed a lease with my partner and cannot afford a mortgage and \u00bd rent. I feel I have been more than generous holding the Condo for a month, even doing things like giving her money for food when they were struggling.

Evicitions are not quick", "NTA but wow, did you ever set yourself up here.\n\nNever allow someone to move in *before* signing a lease. The lease protects both you and your tenant. I get you wanted to help your friend but she decided to go back to her AH bf and then bring him with her to your condo. Sounds like a nightmare in the making.", "NTA, you made a terrible mistake letting someone move in without paying rent or a lease, this person could absolutely ruin you financially, the stories of things like this on r/Landlord would turn your stomach, you need to get them out ***immediately*** by any means necessary before tenancy is established.  If you have not contacted counsel about how to get them out, ***RIGHT NOW***, you need to do that ***TODAY***.", "NTA- You're smart and taking care of yourself. Separate yourself from this trainwreck as quickly and painlessly as possible.", "ESH - BUT frankly I would say you would move into extra asshole territory if you allow this to move forward or continue.\n\nI get you wanted to do this friend a solid, but I don't get any sense that EITHER of you are ready to move into a landlord/renter arrangement. It's all VERY shoddy. You know they can't pay, you let them MOVE in with NO lease, and knowing they cant pay... but then you throw together a lease and want to charge a security deposit?  \n\n\nAgain, I get you're trying to do a friend and her BF a solid and make your move forward with your s/o smoother and easier, but I don't see ANY way this works out for you.\n\nThis friend has outed herself as a grifter, has been a problem before moving in, continued to be one immediately after; **and** she LITERALLY threatened to not be your friend if you don't let her take advantage of you.\n\n\"I hope this doesn't ruin our friendship, I hope we can work it out!\"\n\nTranslation \"It **will** ruin our friendship if you don't give me what I want!\"\n\nRent it to someone else. Hell, rent it to ANYONE else. This woman is letting the red flags FLY and frankly she doesn't sound like a very productive member of society. She sounds like a bit of a loser who is going to not pay you.\n\nAnd if you need one thing in a renter, it's someone whos going to PAY YOUR MORTGAGE every month.", "NTA. You were trying to your friend a solid. I don't think you could have really done more.", "NTA but make sure they are out of there before they turn into squatters, which depending on the area, you'll have a hard time getting them out. Maybe change the locks so they can't get in.", "NTA. Oof. You gotta look out for you and do what\u2019s best for yourself at this point. You tried to help them out and your kind gesture is now becoming a chore. Consider having a conversation down the line with her about how this put you in a tight spot, but I would proceed with evicting them. It appears as though she\u2019s using you and only wants to respond on her time frame/when it\u2019s convenient. This would be a tumultuous situation if you were to proceed with renting the place to her. Proceed with caution. Best of luck!", "NTA they sound very high maintenance and entitled. Evict them otherwise it\u2019s just going to be further fighting in the future.", "NTA, beggers can't be choosers. Sounds like your \"friend\" wants to be both. Doesn't work that way. Better to get her out now than have her never pay a dime down the road.", "NTA-but man you're setting yourself up for trouble here. Never give someone the keys until you have a signed lease. Also, leasing out to this couple is not a good idea unless you can afford the uncertainty of them not paying. Given they were about to split before due to a \"bad situation\", the relationship doesn't sound stable and one or both could leave. It sounds like she's taking advantage of your friendship to weasel out of things (like $500 deposit-very reasonable if you ask me). Best not to do business with friends.", "ESH - Start the eviction process. You opened yourself to legal issues and financial problems by not having a proper lease in place. You did this; not anyone else. \n\nYour friend is using you and playing many cards to keep you at bay: Please pity me...Move your things...Accepting your $ for food...Balking at a deposit fee. Goodness knows if they trashed the place.  \n\nDepending on your city or state law there are squatter rights and as mentioned, r/landlords and like subs have a ton of woe stories due to not-having-a-lease-in-place. Best to you.", "YTA - this entire situation exists because you don't know what you're doing. If you're going to rent you really need to make better decisions and do your research. You definitely need to get them out ASAP but it is your fault. If they have created a tenancy you're in a bad spot.", "ESH\n\nLetting them move in without an agreement in place beforehand isn't a good idea.\n\nCharging a security deposit when you never discussed that beforehand is a big asshole move. The whole point of your friend moving in was that she didn't have money, you offered them the place rent-free (which *is* very generous of you), but you never indicated they would need to pay a security deposit in order to do so.\n\nI don't think either of you were ready to begin a renter/landlord relationship.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, you were a 100% anti-asshole offering a friend a free place to stay to get out of bad relationship.  That alone almost absolved you, but everything you did after that was astronomically stupid to the point of turning you into a pretty big asshole and potential criminal.  \n\nYou went from offering your friend basically a temporary crash pad to get away from a toxic BF, to agreeing to allow the friend and toxic BF to be your full time renters?   And your realized they might not be able to pay, but then demanded a deposit?  And then you (illegally?) evicted them for complaining about the space you were charging them a deposit to rent?\n\nAnd if I understood correctly, your friend and her BF gave up their apartment in anticipation of moving into your condo?  Did you really leave your \u201cfriend\u201d homeless with a toxic BF?  \n\nAnd all the while you knew the math wouldn\u2019t work out paying your new rent while not getting full value for your condo?   What were you going to do if your friend HAD moved out on her BF and never complained about your condo?  Sounds like you were going to have to give her the boot pretty soon anyway.\n\nSo while your heart was initially in the right place, your piss poor decision making turned you into a big time asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
