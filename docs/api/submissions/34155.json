We\u2019re not going through a good patch, and are pretty much on the verge of separation. A lot of things have happened, but this is the most recent. \n\nRecently, he\u2019s taken to tickling me, he pokes my armpits, and I genuinely HATE it! \nHe did it on Christmas Day in front of my parents. I said \u201cdarling, please don\u2019t do that, I really don\u2019t like it\u201d and he kept continuing to do it. My mum thought it was really odd, childish behaviour. He said \u201che liked doing it because he enjoyed my reactions\u201d. I had to tell him\u201dno\u201d and \u201cstop it\u201d 3x before he did. This appears to have become an ongoing theme. \n\nThe other day, I actually snapped and told him to respect my boundaries - I\u2019d already told him to stop and he was grinning like an idiot. When I mentioned boundaries, he put his hands up and said \u201cOK, I just won\u2019t touch you anymore then\u201d and walked off.\n\n He still keeps trying touch me, lightly running fingers on my legs, neck and back which makes me shudder and feels really unpleasant. the other day he walked up to me and just placed his hand between my legs and kept trying to lightly bite my ear??? I\u2019m guessing he was trying to be affectionate? It was all a bit strange really. \n\nSo the question is AITA?\n\nTL;DR: husband keeps tickling me and I snapped and told him to respect my boundaries.", "created_utc": 1704194487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wn74v/aita_for_snapping_at_my_husband_who_keeps/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is repeatedly crossing them to purposely stress you and make you look like the crazy one.", "NTA.  My husband used to do this.  I tried \"don't\" and all that, then started adding verbally threatening him, then nearly clocked him in the face when he surprised me.  After that, I reiterated that I didn't like the tickling and the random groping and it made me angry and that if it continued I was moving out.  Surprise surprise, he was able to stop after that.", "NTA. He is assaulting you. I LOATHE being tickled which my husband knows. So he doesn't. Because he doesn't want to upset me. If he continually did what yours is doing I would absolutely be divorcing him. You should be able to feel safe and secure with your partner, not constantly on edge and anticipating unpleasantness.", "NTA.

Ultimately, it comes back to the fundamental principle that \u2018no means no\u2019. He\u2019s touched you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable. You told him to stop. And so he must stop, end of. \n\nAnd touching you in a sexual way without consent is sexual assault.

I suspect that him trampling your boundaries and not respecting you are recurring themes in your marriage.", "NTA. As someone who, about an hour ago, nearly kicked my bf in the face for touching my feet and tickling me, you\u2019re NTA. When you express a boundary it should be respected. He\u2019s TA for ignoring your request. I HATE when people tickle me. It\u2019s painful for me in the weirdest way and I prefer people not to tickle me. I also had the dad who would hold me upside down by my ankles and tickle my feet when I was little. He also grabbed my feet and tickled them. It finally stopped when I accidentally kicked him in the face. So I totally get what you\u2019re experiencing. It\u2019s annoying. If he\u2019s doing something that you\u2019ve expressed you don\u2019t like he needs to stop and honestly, hit him. He needs to learn to keep his hands to himself.

She clearly said they're on a rough patch already. It is as clear as the sky that the problem isn't *her* reaction, is *his* completely inappropriate and disrespectful behavior.
