I've been there and I know it feels awful, but you staying won't help him, and it's probably hurting you to do so.", "Time to leave.\n\nUnless you feel it is your job to help pathetic people who think they're special and shouldn't have to function in life, because it is too hard.\n\nAs it sits, you are raising a toddler, a toddler who is never going to grow up, and never going to wake up one day and think \"Wow, I was an asshole for tickling her!\"\n\nSo either accept care taking this absolute loser as your full time job, or move on with your life.", "Just leave. Tell him he should be \u201ctickled\u201d you\u2019re finally fucking done.", "> Nothing has changed\n\nAnd it won't. Time for you to change your fate and leave.", "He\u2019s not trying that hard", "Change comes from within. If he has made no progress, that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t really want to. Some people need to have a fire lit under their ass to move.", "Why don\u2019t you guys try to work out together, or do activities like biking if possible?  It sounds like you aren\u2019t even attracted to your husband at all anymore.", "I\u2019m not to be honest. He\u2019s shown no interest in trying to better himself and he has let me down quite a bit in the last 18 months. I\u2019m 36 this year and I want kids. But I do want to help him. I do still care for him, and we can have fun together. It\u2019s just very inconsistent.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, if there\u2019s no attraction left it won\u2019t be an easy situation to fix, if him just touching you disgusts you then you might really need professional marriage counseling or separation \n\nOne question, if he found a woman right now who was attracted to him and he got his needs met with her, how hurt would you be?", "I don\u2019t know. When I think about it, I think it wouldn\u2019t bother me, but never know until it happens. I just feel like if this is how he treat someone he really loves, then it\u2019s quite concerning."]}
