He would also manipulate our parents, more so my mother who was the homemaker, say that it was my fault, and make up a story, that I'd had an accident, etc, which my mother would usually believe, and I would be punished. My mother's adoration for her son, and my brother, made much of my childhood unpleasant, not that there weren't good family times, but my dad worked 70+ hours a week to provide a good life for us, and my mother enjoyed very much the lifestyle that that allowed her. \n\nWell this toxicity continued into our adulthood. I left home at 16, fed up with it, and moved across the country at first, worked 3 jobs, went to school, figured it out to make something of myself. I eventually moved back for a short time and then moved provinces again, and then returned a decade later, again, when I left an abusive partner, with a baby in tow. At that time I moved in with my parents, partly to help take care of my dad in what I hoped would be his last years, ended up being his last year. My brother lived with them throughout with the exception of the 2 years that I lived there with my baby. As soon as I left a year after my dad's passing, he moved back in, and is now thoroughly enjoying living with our mother and being pampered by her. \n\nAll of this to say, I met my fianc\u00e9e 2 and a half years ago, we're very happy, and will be married next year. He's amazing to my now big kid, takes great care of me, we each have a decent career, work hard, support each other,  we just work well. I don't want my brother at my wedding. I want to have a small, intimate wedding, with no drama, just quiet, and happy. I don't see my brother having a place in that picture. I don't see him as a brother, but as an abuser, who's never taken accountability for his actions. I've already sent out invitations, without his name on it, only to my mother.

You deserve your wedding day to be free of drama, to feel safe, and loved by those closest to you. Your abuser doesn't fit that. I hope you have the wedding of your dreams!", "NTA, but be prepared for your mother to try and bring him along anyway. I personally wouldn't have invited your mother to be honest, considering how much she enabled your brother and his abuse towards you growing up. But what's done is done. Best have a conversation with your mother (without your brother present) and explain clearly why he is not invited and be prepared to accept the fact that she will more than likely choose him (as she has done so for decades) over attending your wedding.", "I'm surprised you invited your mother.

And please make sure you're safe if there's any outrage from either of them for it.", "Your mother is the other one who abused you. You should consider uninviting her too.\n NTA for not inviting your brother but YTA for not clarifying the subject. You are not a helpless child anymore.", "You should ask yourself this because it bothers me: why on earth would you invite the enabler and excuse maker for your brother to the wedding, I get it\u2019s your mother but she clearly show\u2019s favoritism towards your brother and has your entire life. You have to know deep down that even if your brother doesn\u2019t have an invite your mom would bring him because he\u2019s the replacement for your dad, as sick as that sounds. Oh, and if he has a girlfriend, expect her to be there and him proposing to her to take away from your day and make it about him. I would rescind the invite to your mom because you can\u2019t trust her to obey your wishes of your brother not being there and honestly, I would let her know point blank that if she DOES come to your wedding she is not to bring him and if she does they will be escorted out by security. If you don\u2019t have security you should look into it.", "NTA- you don't owe your brother a thing. I don't think your mother deserves an invite either for enabling his abuse.", "Thank you. This is my concern as well. I'm also struggling with wording it in a way that won't cause an uproar with my mother. I would feel awful if my mother didn't come, but am willing to uninvite her if she pushes to have my brother there. She has also suggested she and my brother walk me down the aisle, to which I said I would likely walk myself.. because honestly without my dad I would rather stand on my own.", "I've struggled with that idea.. of course I know just how complicit my family has been in my abuse, and in spoiling him rotten actually, but the idea of only having my extended family,  those that have told him to back off, etc, seems so sad. I feel like my mother deserves to see one of her children walk down the aisle. Especially because we're getting married in an old family spot, more so one that I enjoyed with my dad, but my mother's family owned the property which permitted us to visit this spot. I guess I will have to see how the conversation goes with my mother", "Honestly it's not hard to hear, I've brought it up to her many times over the years, in, and outside of therapy, it's always resulted in an argument, and me avoiding her for some time. \nI really appreciate you writing out the conversation that needs to be had. I struggle with being firm with her, she always plays off being hurt, etc, and gaslights me into feeling bad for reproaching her. You are 100% right, I need to be firm and assertive, for mine\uff0cmy child's, and my fianc\u00e9e's sake. This will likely be a conversation had after the holidays.", "Thank you so much! I feel like this is the validation I was looking for from someone outside of my circle who may just be yes manning me.. much appreciated! \ud83d\ude0a", "Totally agree with this. Your mom should suspect that your brother abused you.", "I've brought it up  a couple of times, and like you said, she denied, dismissed, and was appalled at the accusations towards him and the implications of her parenting. We didn't talk for over a year as a result, and our relationship is still, and may never be, a great one. I appreciate her for my child's sake, she's a good grandmother, and we don't have a lot of family left, but I keep her at arms length otherwise.", "Thank you, you're right, my child is now at the age where the abuse with my brother started to get really bad, I can't allow that in my child's life.

It would be far better for you to set the time, the place, the setting, and hire a babysitter and make sure your fianc\u00e9 is with you as you meet with your mother to explain the rules well before the wedding so it's done and dusted and you can stop worrying about the maybes and the what ifs.

You\u2019re under no obligation to invite anyone you don\u2019t want there.", "Well, in that case I hope your mom at least stays quiet about it at your wedding. Sometimes moms (or elder relatives in general) deny the undeniable just for the sake of  \"peace\" within the family. It sucks, but it is what it is.", "What if she turns a blind eye if your brother abuses her also? I know she is your birth mother, but she does not seem like much of a mom to me.", "You are more than welcome and I am so happy for you and amazed at all that you have overcome and accomplished.  I hope the wedding is glorious!", "Yes, exactly, some family dynamics are less than desirable. The other people that she will know at the wedding won't allow for her to speak poorly of the decision, that I know for certain. I'm honestly just scared to have this conversation with her.", "Thank you so much! It will be! All we want is a day to celebrate our union, with our family and nearest and dearest. \nOn a river bank where i spent much of my childhood playing while my dad fished, late in the afternoon just as the shade starts to take over the valley. We're very excited. Thank you so much!", "You're an adult with a child to protect so I find it worrying you're still in touch with your mum as no doubt she'd see nothing wrong in letting your brother near your child if she's alone with them. You really need to grow a backbone.  She abused you, who's to say she wont abuse your child."]}
