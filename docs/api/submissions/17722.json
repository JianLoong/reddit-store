She's currently due in six months, and obviously isn't doing the best mentally right now. She'll be able to finish this year at school, but starting next year they have some kind of online course program so she can still graduate while taking care of the baby.\n\nOur parents made it this baby is her responsibility, and aside from watching it when and only when she's at work, they aren't going to contribute to its care at all. The plan is for her to work starting now until she can't, than start working again to pay for the kid once she recovers. I think that's fair, it will be her child after all, and I think even agreeing to watch it at all is very generous.\n\nI feel the same way, and told her I'm not doing anything. I don't like kids, so I'm not holding it, watching it, feeding it, anything. When I told her this, she broke down crying and said I don't realize how hard this is. I reminded her that that's not my problem, and it's not too late to change her mind if she can't handle it.\n\nShe pretty much blocked both me and our parents out after that, she never talks to any of us anymore. On one hand I feel bad because I'm sure this is a lot for her, but again that's her responsibility.

She's a child who fucked up. She's now rightly terrified of how hard her life will be. Making her choose between aborting her baby and losing the support and empathy of her family is some heartless shit.\n\nYTA. Learn some empathy.", ">\"I don't realize how hard this is\"\n\n\"Yes I do, that's why I am not having one.\"\n\nNTA\n\nMuch better for you all to tell her this up front. Much better for her to realise just how hard her life with a baby will be NOW, while there is still time to prevent it. Let's hope she sees sense and either aborts or adopts.", "I think your family is showing her that she would be able to be a normal teenager and do normal teenager things if she puts the baby up for adoption. The alternative is she gives up her freedom for many years and has to become a responsible adult. It\u2019s a harsh but fair prospect for her to consider. I\u2019m speaking from personal experience here. In reality your parents will support her if she decides to keep the baby. This is, was and always will be grossly unfair. The fact that one half of the equation can waltz off scott free and leave all of the responsibility on the woman AS WELL as the judgemental disdain of society (just look at some of the shit in this very thread), is appalling in the 21st Century. 40 years ago my entire family and village rallied round me but I live in a different country.", "Nta. She's choosing to keep the baby. That has consequences. Babies need full time care for 18yrs, and she gets 6mos to figure that out or put it up for adoption.   She can either enjoy the rest of hs or take care of a child. She can't have both. This isn't your problem.", "Jeez talk about lack of empathy here, yeah the baby is her choice but it really seems like everyone in her life is happy to treat her with contempt for being pregnant. She\u2019s 16, a minor, scared and needs support and literally her family are like \u201cnot my problem\u201d. She\u2019s not good mentally and you and your parents are shutting her out. Your parents are the worst, you lack any form of empathy and she\u2019s just a scared stupid teenager. ESH. If you want any form of relationship with your sister I urge you to reconsider your behaviour. You don\u2019t have to look after the child but you can damn we\u2019ll be supportive of her in other ways. Your friend is right, you are pretty heartless.", "I\u2019ll take the downvotes and go with ESH, just a little less for the pregnant sister.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where they live. It could be a place with little or no sexual education for teenagers. Even with internet access to information a teenager may not even think about looking information up until it\u2019s too late. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how much information the parents gave their kids about sex, protection and the expense of babies. They could be religious and not said anything or pushed abstinence only. This girl could have had no idea she had options to prevent pregnancy. And, once again, we don\u2019t know where they live. They may not have a Planned Parenthood near them to help.\n\nShe\u2019s 16, probably a young 16. Her boyfriend is probably the same age and he\u2019s gone. Getting child support is going to tough until he\u2019s an adult and working full time. She can\u2019t even take care of herself, much less a helpless infant. \n\nWho is going to provide healthcare? Formula? How is she going to do online classes with a newborn? A toddler?  \n\nIt is not OP\u2019s job to babysit or provide financial aid. I only think they suck a bit for not having more empathy for a younger sibling but they are essentially a child themselves.\n\nThe parents are another story. They have a grandchild on the way and their daughter is about to go through a thoroughly dangerous medical condition that could kill her or her child. She\u2019s already fragile enough from finding out she\u2019s pregnant and her bf skipping town. What is this callousness from her parents going to do to her mental health? They\u2019ve basically abandoned her and their grandchild save for providing shelter.

They of course are the HUGE assholes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister is a child. Your parents are responsible for making sure she grows up ok. Parents whose kid is having a kid have already failed their kid miserably, and now are failing her further. As far as I am concerned, a kid born to your minor kid is effectively your kid, and you are responsible for it until such a time as the mother can finish her education and get a good job to support the family. And no, jobs you can get at 16 with no diploma do not count.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents need to start adulting and take care of their daughter and kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou do not, though if you do it would be nice.

That is... cold.", "NAH\n\nSixteen is young. Those of us who weren't saddled with permanent consequences for being an idiot as a teenager are lucky. We either dodged the worst or we chose different stupid things.\n\nShe may have chosen poorly. And you are under no obligation to help her.\n\nBut, she's a young, pregnant woman experiencing all the fears and trepidations of a woman going through a first pregnancy without her partner. She's not getting emotional support from her family. She's a child.\n\nWe lambast husbands on this sub all the time for not giving their wives a break from childcare. For not being emotionally supportive.\n\nShe doesn't have anyone other than you and your parents.\n\nMaybe be a little kinder. She's already going through a lot.", "Ummm.\n\n1. She can still go after him for child support regardless of where he moved to. He is EQUALLY responsible for this child.\n\n 2. She might qualify for benefits like daycare, food stamps, etc\n\nAnd as far as you go, I would kinda call you an AH just out of the idea that your all attacking a pregnant woman. You dont have to do anything but just out of the blue coming out and saying all this stuff to a girl who basically ruined the next 10 years of her life if shes smart enough to get out of it or the rest of it if she isnt smart enough is just alot. \n\nTons of people get pregnant young and it's a tale as old as time. You dont have to be mean about it.", "NTA and I would encourage you to move out when you can to pursue your studies because a screaming baby in the house will definitely impact you (sleep, concentration/distraction etc) and even if you don't want to help out you'll probably have to deal with her sulking about that fact or trying to strong arm you into it anyway.", "YTA. What a heartless family. And the boy and his parents just easily moved away \ud83d\ude11", "NTA. You have your own life to live. You don't deserve to be saddled with babysitting. She got her self into this and it's on her to deal with it.", "YTA. Your sister is 16 pregnant and has been abandoned by the father. Your you deserve everything horrible that is happening to you makes you an asshole. Is there anyone in your sister\u2019s life that cares about her?\n\nYou\u2019re kicking someone when they\u2019re down. That\u2019s what makes you an asshole. You don\u2019t have to raise the baby, but you don\u2019t have to act like you are either.", "NTA....actions have consequences and your sister is quickly realizing that her lack of planning and protection is resulting in her having to grow up much faster than she thought. It's not your responsibility to help if you don't want to and you making it clear from the start is the best for all involved", "It\u2019s a difficult one, but YTA.\n\nYou are right, it is her responsibility, but it is also her boyfriend\u2019s responsibility, and as his family are even worse than yours when it comes to empathy and doing what is right, she is going to need help to ensure he can\u2019t run from his responsibilities.\n\nYou and your parents really need to think about the consequences of your actions and decisions. Yes you do not HAVE to help her, but if you want to have any kind of relationship with her or her child going forward, then you should help.\n\nAnd help doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018holding it, watching it, feeding it\u2019 it could be that you help by assisting your sister with other things while she is caring for her child.", "NTA - not everyone likes or wants anything to do with kids. You have no obligation towards someone else\u2019s child.", "Your sister is learning a hard lesson about how some young mothers have families willing to be super active in their child\u2019s life and some don\u2019t (although I do think it\u2019s very generous that your parents plan to watch the baby while she\u2019s working\u2014that\u2019s a major financial burden eased since she won\u2019t have to pay for childcare that there\u2019s no way a 16 year old can afford anyway) and they can\u2019t force their family to do that for them. I feel sorry for her because she\u2019s a kid who is only now coming to terms with the true gravity of her situation, but I guess it\u2019s better that everyone makes shit clear now instead of misleading her about how much they\u2019ll realistically contribute to the child\u2019s care. I hope that your parents have made it abundantly clear that she MUST take all of the steps she can to pursue her ex for child support. Even if he doesn\u2019t have a job, his parents may be liable for it, and her child needs all the money they can get. I also hope that she\u2019s seriously considering adoption as an alternative even though that\u2019s often an extremely difficult and even traumatic experience for the birth mother. I get the feeling that your parents aren\u2019t exactly going to let her and her child live with them forever, so if she\u2019s going to be out on her ass in a few years, she\u2019s in for an extremely difficult life as a single mother. \n\nNTA but your relationship with your sister has probably been permanently negatively altered. If you\u2019ve made peace with that, then that\u2019s your business. Considering that youre 18, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re probably going to college/some other form of secondary education or possibly leaving the home altogether so it seems unrealistic that you\u2019d be able to contribute much to childcare anyway. I think you could be more emotionally supportive though. For example, why was it necessary to emphasize that you \u201cdon\u2019t like kids\u201d? You could have said \u201cI love you and I want things to work out for you, but you need to understand that I\u2019m an adult now, and I have a lot of things going on in my own life that I need to make sure get handled because my future depends on it. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to give you the sort of help you need\u201d or something along those lines", "NTA for your position, but I think your parents are being AHs. There is no empathy here; I'm not surprised she's completely shut down on you all.", "ESH\n\nShe doesn't deserve to have a totally unsupported lifelong consequence for a moment of irresponsibility. Think of the baby in this - yes she was stupid but she is 16 years old for goodness sake, scared and financially unstable. Her whole family is turning their backs on her for one stupid mistake (and one she sure as heck won't make again)\n\n\"*On one hand I feel bad because I'm sure this is a lot for her.......but I didn't make them, so I don't see that as my problem\"* My god you are all heart and then some aren't you.", "YTA.

It\u2019s like you and your family are more interested in punishing her for being pregnant at 16 because that makes her a stupid fuck-up blah blah blah than having one iota of sympathy for how terrified and abandoned she\u2019s feeling. She\u2019s only sixteen! She has to get a job while pregnant and physically suffering from it, give birth and tear her body apart, basically drop out of school, and take care of a fucking baby. Most 16 year-olds cannot relate, at all.\n\nShe probably feels like her life is effectively over. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s considering ending her life\u2014she may agree with you and your parents that she\u2019s just weighing you all down and you\u2019d be better off if she removes herself before she gives birth. I\u2019m not saying this because I hope it happens, but as someone who\u2019s lost a loved one to suicide myself.

I understand having  a baby that young is scary and you aren't always emotionally mature enough but seriously don't get pregnant. Even if she was on birth control teenagers still should be using condoms and avoiding sex when they know they are about to be super fertile.  I know some women don't have the choice when they get pregnant by coercion or abuse but most teenagers lack the education or maturity to know what they are doing.", "i absolutely think youre NTA however if you want a relationship with your sister and nibbling in the future thats something to consider. She probably wont feel very sisterly towards you for a while and once the kid is old enough to understand and hear the story theyre likely to have feelings about it.

It's not your child and you have no obligation to care for it.", "I mean\u2026none of you are wrong in that this is 100% her responsibility. It is nice that she has your parents to at least help with work/school. It is going to be really hard for her though.

I want to go with NAH technically, though I\u2019d personally try to at least be a bit more empathetic towards her.

She already had to make a hard decision and to keep throwing it in her face that you think she made the wrong one do you want to punish her snd be cruel to her when she is hormonal and worried and dressed is absolutely cruel and really mean.

I'm in my 30s, and my partner is nearly 20 wks with our first, it's also a planned and wanted pregnancy. I'm still nervous as all hell about becoming a father and if I'll be able to provide a good life for my kid. I sure as shit wouldn't have been able to provide anything at 16, nor in my 20s. My partner had her first while in a highly abusive relationship and gave it up for adoption because she didn't believe she could provide a good life nor be a good mother at the time. We're in contact with the parents and the kid has been to every continent but Antarctica. She's happy, healthy and living her best life.", "What is your point here exactly? Are you saying an abortion being a logical option for her is bigotry?", "Even seasoned new mothers need help. Yes, they need to set the precedent that she\u2019s responsible for the baby and the primary caregiver. Yes, she\u2019s responsible for the consequences of her actions. But a little empathy from her family wouldn\u2019t hurt.", "Being a mother does not magically make her not a child. On the contrary, someone who gets pregnant at 16 is probably LESS mature and ready to face the adult world than your average teen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd when her parents had a kid, they DID bargain that something unexpected or wrong could happen. Including a pregnancy (or illness, or accident, or addiction or any number of things). That is part of being a parent. Their job is to prepare her for adulthood. Not only is she not yet prepared, she has a setback that will make it more difficult. That's the ball the world threw at her parents.  Their job is to help her get on her feet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd she IS doing what she needs to do. She is working and has a plan to finish high school. She will need support. They need to support her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, OP does not need to. If she moves away she can, and if she wants to she should. But someone who won't even hold their new niece or nephew is an AH.", "You don't know for certain that abortion is even an option, who knows. Maybe the family is religious and won't let her. Maybe abortion isn't available in her state.", "Yes but she is a child. Aged 16, I had no idea how to even get started on those sort of things. Her parents really should've taken the responsibility of holding the boy and his parents accountable. Instead, the whole family is treating her like some social pariah who they're just barely tolerating. And as if she just did this to herself on her own. OP isn't the AH hor not wanting to do baby duty. But the whole attitude towards the sister is very unkind.", "With zero support from her parents? How would she even start? She's 16.", "There\u2019s not helping in an asshole way and not helping in a nonasshole way. I was saying choose the latter.", "Well maybe someone should have talked to her about sex. Helped her get birth control. Told her about condoms. Obviously, there was something going on here and the parents weren't doing their jobs.", "Sorry I may have worded what I meant wrong I totally agree that having sex at 16 and getting pregnant is a sign of immaturity to me but often people think having sex is a sign of maturity or being cool. I think both boys and girls feel pressured at that age in to doing things and I get hormones pay a huge part but also teenagers have got to learn to be responsible. Sex comes with consequences and not just pregnancy but they often forget in the moment. I was lucky to be educated from a young age about the consequences of sex and made the choice to not even think about having sex with anyone until I deemed myself fully responsible and mature enough. I know some parents are squeamish about talking to their kids about sex but they really need to drum home that sex has consequences such as pregnancy and diseases and that also getting yourself into some situations that are potentially dangerous.", "Not necessarily making the assumption but most people know that sex can lead to pregnancy and if they don't they shouldn't be doing it.", "I rarely have any sympathy for pregnant teenagers (obviously abuse, coercion and rape victims aside) it frustrates me that they have these 'accidents' when it's the act of sex that can lead to having a baby. Yet you've got 15/16 year olds desperate to be having sex and yet they aren't protecting themselves. Scares me how many people aren't using condoms anymore especially in their teens and in casual encounters. Education on sex needs to be better from parents and schools. It's frustrating for her parents and the OP - when it could of been easily prevented (considering how hard it can be to actually get pregnant) that this is going to impact their lives. Also teenagers need to be held accountable for their actions.", "She's 16. Let's just remember that she's a child and yes, mistakes happen. Accidents happen. So all they can do is leave a child at her most vulnerable situation just because she wants to take the responsibility of the situation? This is not the time to argue about how much help they can offer. This is the time to make the girl feel safe. If we want to blame the 16 yo for keeping her pregnancy why parents aren't having any blame to not give sex education properly to that child? It's so easy to say to abort the child as an outsider. It's so easy to blame a 16 yo for her mistakes. We strangers can do that. But her parents have to stand with her. Not making her feel like alone physically as well as emotionally.", "The daughter is 16 and is pregnant. Straight up staying in a new home. Scare her straight can only do one thing. Adding more pressure to her emotional turmoil. Pregnancies are not just physically taxing but it's very taxing emotionally as well. The girl is just a teen who is not at all stable emotionally. Yes, this should not have happened. But if it has happened and the girl want to keep the baby means scare her straight is not the thing parents should do. Also, what both parents and sister here are saying \"we won't be with you in your struggle because you messed up\" is very upsetting. We dont need our family not just when we took the right decision but also on wrong decisions. They don't need to help them for a life time but an immediate help when the baby is new born is not much to ask. They don't even worry about the little girl who is pregnant but about the responsibility they might get! The priorities are wrong here.", "Not everyone on Reddit is from the US....", "NTA: Not everyone enjoys or desires involvement with children. You owe no one anything regarding their child.", "It\u2019s unrealistic to think she can take care of a baby while doing that, she\u2019s still going to have classes to attend and assignments to complete.", "Finish high school yes, but what about college?

This is not about breaking a phone, its not a \"told you so\" situation. This is about a child bearing a child, and I find it weird that they are putting all responsibility for this on it alone. But never mind. \n\nWhat I am stating though is that R4Eths statement about the 18 years is exactly the opposite of what OPs parents are doing.", "OP has no responsibility, its not her \"problem\" to solve, but I am just pointing to R4Eth, stating that if that 18 year statement were true, OPs parents are still 2 years short on that, \"look after your child until its 18\" also applies to OPs parents, but they leave her 16 old alone.  I get the responsibility part and agree, but still the behaviour of OPs parents is not at all like R4Eth in the \"18 year responsibility\" speech makes. That's the bigotry.", "There\u2019s always adoption too.", "Your facts are all wrong. Teens have been consistently getting pregnant less and using contraceptives more in the past 2 decades. In the past few years, we've even had less and less high schoolers being sexually active in the first place.", "So it went from she got pregnant on accident negate \"mistakes happen\" to she got pregnant vacate her parents didn't teach her about contraception. Which is it? And I never said abort. At this point, I doubt she can. But adoption is still definitely on the table. When you become a parent, you have a whole other person dependent on you.

She\u2019s just gonna have to figure it out. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to think your sibling and parents are going to be splitting parental responsibilities with you despite them having their own lives.

You said the parents don\u2019t care about her. Yet she\u2019ll still be living at home while they provide childcare and everything else she\u2019s been provided her whole childhood. So yeah they are still providing for their child so that she is better able to provide for her own.", "I feel pretty bad for the sister too, she is still a child and having a baby is a two parent job, because it takes two people to make it happen. Second parent fucked off the second he realized his equally big part of the fucking around and finding out, and now a child have to bear the full responsibility of two parents at once, while still being a child herself. Nobody owes her anything for the mistake she was part of making, sure, but its not a criminal act to have the teeniest bit of compassion for a child in a physically and mentally challenging and difficult position. \n\nIf the babys dad had stayed and done his part, sister would not be in as fucked of a situation as she is now, its not sisters fault she got abandoned by him and shouldn't be treated as if its all entirely her fault", "No when you blame a 16 yo child for getting pregnant and to choose to have the baby why her parents are blame free? It's their responsibility to help and they can't just say it's your baby, so your responsibility. Abortion or adoption - both are so emotional options that no others can have a say in it. They can only lay down good and bad of both decisions. But all they are doing is not making a talk with her but simply say don't bother us with your problems. So I simply asked if the child is the whole responsibility of a 16 yo then who will take the responsibility for the parents being so careless so far? The one thing they proved to that 16 yo girl is that she can't rely on them when she face a problem. I know parents who are against raising the child at first but gave value to their child's decision in keeping them. Helped at the early stage so later the daughter can take over. When we raise a child, all kind of situation will happen.
