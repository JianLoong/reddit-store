I have been to a lot of different parties across the country for a lot of different reasons.  Literally every party had alcohol unless it was a kid\u2019s birthday party or the context made it abundantly clear that alcohol was straight-up inappropriate (e.g., at my Muslim friend\u2019s parties).  At least tell people BYOB.  \n\nAnd BTW it\u2019s not just about booze.  If someone threw a Halloween party with no food and no warning, that would also be weird.  Social expectations are not necessarily objectively correct or anything, but it\u2019s generally respectful to at least act on/acknowledge them.", "That's fair enough too. Here you'd never ask, you just bring your own alcohol. Occasionally if someone was hosting a celebration like a promotion they may let you know they're providing beer or something but that's definitely the exception not the rule.", "I found out like a month ago in America the host supplies the alcohol too though", "I've seen my family drink. I couldn't afford that. Lol"]}
