At least tell people BYOB.  \n\nAnd BTW it\u2019s not just about booze.  If someone threw a Halloween party with no food and no warning, that would also be weird.  Social expectations are not necessarily objectively correct or anything, but it\u2019s generally respectful to at least act on/acknowledge them.", "That's fair enough too. Here you'd never ask, you just bring your own alcohol. Occasionally if someone was hosting a celebration like a promotion they may let you know they're providing beer or something but that's definitely the exception not the rule.", "I found out like a month ago in America the host supplies the alcohol too though", "I've seen my family drink. I couldn't afford that. Lol", "Guys\u2026\n\nTaking for granted that you\u2019re gonna get free booze is the real asshole move here lol.\n\nWho the fuck arrives somewhere empty handed?", "NTA \n\nWho raised these alcoholics that can't go 5 minutes in a social setting without getting blasted drunk or whinging about not having it readily available to guzzle? They must be so boring if drinking is their whole personality. \n\nThere are a million reasons not to serve, have, or consume something you don't want to or like in your own home as an adult.", "TA", "In Australia BYO is the norm- it\u2019s rare that the host will supply alcohol and if they do they will tell you beforehand otherwise it\u2019s expected you\u2019ll bring your own.\nBut, if culturally where you live booze is supplied then forewarning guests it\u2019s BYO would be the prudent thing to do.", "Didn't need to read beyond the title to say NTA!", "Wow NTA what kind of parasitic behavior is this to go to someone's house and expect they get drunj off them..?\n\nIsn't it customary to bring a gift to the host (usualy bottle of wine) as thanks for the invitation?? You're offering hospitality, not hosting a bar open VIP party...", "NTA and you owe him nothing. He offered to buy the alcohol, and as your best friend, he knows your stance on the subject.\n\nI don\u2019t believe people expect alcohol when they go somewhere, I know I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve been to a lot of parties that didn\u2019t specify alcohol or not, and I still had a good time. But I\u2019m also not a fan of alcohol.\n\nI would suggest you can start saying BYOA (bring your own alcohol). \n\nAlcohol should not make or break a party, and if people HAVE to have it to have fun, you might not want to be really close with them. Your best friend sounds like that type of person.", "ESH. It\u2019s fine to not serve alcohol at your parties but let people know it\u2019s BYOB. Your friend asking you to pay for alcohol when you don\u2019t drink is asinine. He definitely should have handled himself better and you definitely should have made it clear that it was BYOB. Hopefully lesson learned.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised by the comments here. Why would OP pay for alcohol she never consumed? Yes, alcohol is normally served at parties but it\u2019s not a requirement. Nobody was obligated to stay at the party if having no alcohol was such a big deal.\n\nThe friend who bought the alcohol should be asking the other people who chose to drank to split the $75 instead. If it was that big of a deal he should have worked out the finances before purchasing the alcohol in the 1st place.", "NTA - you don't drink, and you don't owe people anything just because they can't have fun without being trashed.

And send him a venmo request for twice the sum as a charge for being lectured in your own house about your own party.", "People who can\u2019t go through an evening with their friends without drinking are alcoholics.

What did these people bring to the party if not alcohol? I personally don\u2019t really drink much since most alcohol is acidic and I can\u2019t handle it, so I always bring dessert to a party, but I am curious that if they weren\u2019t bringing alcohol what did they bring? BYOB is pretty standard. Even to a dinner party you might bring a bottle of wine as your host gift.", "YTA. \n\nYou were a bad host assuming everyone was happy just because you felt fine. \n\nIt is unreasonable to expect you to buy alcohol but at least make it clear to first-timers the party is BYOB.\n\nYour friend voiced everything correctly: he saved your party.", "YTA for not warning people since it\u2019s normal to let people know if it\u2019s BYOB. \n\nBut no you don\u2019t have to pay for it.", "NTA.

Why does he think he \"saved\" your party by bringing it? \n\n\"You should've said there wasn't going to be alcohol.\" But why is that the default? \n\n\"You have to pay me back for this.\" But why would you pay for something you had no interest in? You didn't say you'd have it, why would he assume you would? Why is alcohol the default?\n\nNTA. Good on you for standing firm on your decision. You don't need to have alcohol to have a good time.

You (and anyone else) can take what ever view, regarding if it\u2019s right or wrong, that they want to take.

If a party had no booze and the host did not want/allow it, I'd either show up drunk, find ways to do it discreetly or simply go to a different party.

At some point a few people made a liquor store run, but most people were pretty fine with the fact that we just had soda.

It just seems\u2026 odd. I wouldn\u2019t ever expect to be provided with alcoholic beverages, nor in my experience have my friends. Truth, maybe it\u2019s a generational thing,  IDK.  But I\u2019m going with NTA.", "NTA. You need to reevaluate who you keep as your best friend. Kev sounds incredibly entitled. Do not pay him anything. If he wants money, he can request it from the people who asked for and drank the alcohol. \n\nHe already knew beforehand that you don\u2019t drink or provide alcohol at your parties. I\u2019m confused as to why he\u2019d think this would change if you didn\u2019t give any indication otherwise? Like maybe if he\u2019d talked with you before maybe you could have done a little something, but even then, you don\u2019t drink so why should you have to provide people with something that won\u2019t even benefit you at your own party\u2026 \n\nIf they were really so concerned about being able to drink at the party, they would have provided their own. I would never expect anything of anyone throwing a party. All you really need to provide for a good party is a space to host it and good vibes, maybe some music. Anything more than that is not required. \n\nIf they need to drink to have fun, they\u2019re living very sad lives. And expecting anyone to provide you with free alcohol is entitled. There really isn\u2019t a better word to use. Like imagine going to someone\u2019s party and expecting the host to provide everyone with weed. Better yet, imagine having the audacity to request $75 from the host for the weed you bought and smoked\u2026 \n\nI have never in my life walked into a party and expected the host to provide me with anything. Not food, not alcohol, not bud. NOTHING. And I also don\u2019t expect the host to have to say anything either. BYOB should be implied/a given.

For a supper, maybe people can bring a hostess gift instead, but who goes to a party without a bottle of wine or 6-pack if they do drink?", "As a guest, I know that if I go to a party or get together in the home of someone who doesn\u2019t drink, I have 2 options\u2026 suck it up and go with what they serve OR bring my own. If I\u2019m unsure whether it would be acceptable at that party, I leave it in the car or a bag until I find out it\u2019s welcomed. As someone who has to watch what I eat and drink, I do the same. I try my hardest to politely ask ahead of time, but life tends to get in the way and I don\u2019t always remember to. \n\nIf new people are joining your party, I would definitely inform people ahead of time. But, if you don\u2019t drink, it\u2019s not your responsibility to provide the alcohol.  If you choose to do so, that\u2019s another matter entirely. Personally, if you choose not to drink, stick to your guns and don\u2019t change your decision not to provide alcohol.", "NTA, In my younger days I attended many party's in a collage town.

I also think your bestie was genuinely initially trying to help the situation BUT $75 is a TON of money and it is NOT okay to just assume that you should pay that amount back when it wasn\u2019t discussed lol. In no world would I pay all that for a Halloween party. I might send some of it but $75 is way too much.

Or, we'd split the cost of a large carton of wine, or split the cost of different ingredients for mixed drinks like strawberry daiquiries. At less strong parties I could bring one type of cider and someone else could bring beer, and we'd swap a cider for a beer etc.\n\nBut I never went to a house party and expected to be served alcohol.

Majority of people ask why aren\u2019t you drinking ? Because I don\u2019t need to be wasted to enjoy time with you people", "If people need alcohol so much that they need to complain if a party doesn't have it, the issue is theirs, not the hosts", "Also, I just realized my original \u201cyou sound boring as fuck\u201d comment wasn\u2019t intended for you, I responded to the wrong comment, so I appreciate your not lashing out about that and I apologize for coming in hostile out of nowhere!", "I guess I just have more fun friends than the rest of you, because the last thing on my mind when I go out with them is whether alcohol will be served.", "Wait, where did it say this was a late-night party?", "Agreed, it\u2019s harsh to claim that anyone who expects a drink at a party is an alcoholic. But the people who can\u2019t enjoy themselves at her party without making a scene about the lack of booze are TA.", "I don\u2019t drink, I\u2019ve never drank. But even I have asked if I needed to contribute something to the party. I brought Smirnoff one time for someone who wanted them to mix drinks.", "It absolutely is, maybe you're in some weird ass circle where host buys the grog but this isn't the norm here", "Well I\u2019m in Australia and I\u2019d say since about 30th parties started the host usually supplies. Guests usually bring something to be polite whether it\u2019s a gift or a bottle of wine etc. I\u2019m not in a \u2018wierd ass\u2019 circle.", "And I'm in Australia too and everyone brings their own drinks to parties, so yes you're in some weird ass circle where they don't do it that way."]}
