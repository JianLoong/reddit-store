It was kinda rude of her to ask you to step in at the last minute, imo, and it was certainly rude of her to not accept your polite decline of that invite to step in at the last minute, especially since it contained a very reasonable explanation of why that was not going to work for you/your family. Where she really, really went wrong and put herself into HUGE A H territory was yelling at you, calling you names, then using curse words and hanging up the phone on you. I dare say the friend who are sending you messages about at least make the effort to attend the wedding do not know the full story - the name calling and cursing after you gave a very reasonable reason why you and your husband could not drop your lives to take care of her wedding at the last minute. Either decide that their their opinions do not matter or message them something like \"My friend called  to ask me rush to Scotland on short notice to fix her bridal emergency at the expense of my family life - my husband would have had to take 2 weeks off work to watch our young child so that I could act as MOH and that was just not reasonable or possible for us to do at this time and I explained this to her.
