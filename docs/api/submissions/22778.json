You can't treat people like crap and then expect them to forget about it, particularly when she didn't bother to apologize for what she said to you.

And because she \"blew up\" at you, you then decided not to go? I am confused. Or maybe I misread it.", "NTA You are married and have a young child at home - you explained to  her that your husband could not take off work to watch the baby while you dashed off to Scotland to help her. It was kinda rude of her to ask you to step in at the last minute, imo, and it was certainly rude of her to not accept your polite decline of that invite to step in at the last minute, especially since it contained a very reasonable explanation of why that was not going to work for you/your family. Where she really, really went wrong and put herself into HUGE A H territory was yelling at you, calling you names, then using curse words and hanging up the phone on you. I dare say the friend who are sending you messages about at least make the effort to attend the wedding do not know the full story - the name calling and cursing after you gave a very reasonable reason why you and your husband could not drop your lives to take care of her wedding at the last minute. Either decide that their their opinions do not matter or message them something like \"My friend called  to ask me rush to Scotland on short notice to fix her bridal emergency at the expense of my family life - my husband would have had to take 2 weeks off work to watch our young child so that I could act as MOH and that was just not reasonable or possible for us to do at this time and I explained this to her. She responded by calling me names, cursing at me and hanging up the phone. TBH, I did not figure I was even welcome at the wedding after that, so we did not attend.\" Take comfort in knowing that YNTA and move on... without this particular friend in your life (unless she comes through with a story of a brain aneurysm that made her temporarily insane and a sincerely genuine apology and even then, be cautious).", "Appreciate it. I actually felt a bit guilty after all the messages I got this week. She little gossiped about me during her wedding and asked ppl to msg me....", "Here a MOH does pretty much everything the bride asks to. At my wedding, tho, I hired an assistant aka coordinator, and my so called ex best friend literally did nothing except holding the rings and walking down the aile w her then boyfriend...", "For sure. I just can't believe our high school colleagues agree with her.", "She told everyone that I found excuses not to help ... lol", "I thought I was the only one who thought those comments were weird.", "Are you kidding?  This went far beyond a disagreement between friends.  This was verbal abuse. I'd have cut her off, too. Good riddance.", "My best friend and I go months without talking all the time. She's a mom of 2, and I work full time. Life gets busy, and things come up. We occasionally tag each other in odd things on Facebook or react to a personal post, but sometimes, not talking a friend for an extended period of time happens. My best friend and I can always pick up like nothing changed. LIFE happens to everyone!", "Tell the friends the truth. The 1st MoH left and how she expected you and your husband to drop your jobs for 2 weeks for her.", "Of course, but she expects you to drop everything for her... tsk tsk\nYou don't need that kind of a friend, OP.", "You don\u2019t know what she told them though. The kind of people that act like Meg did usually don\u2019t want to own up to it. \n\nNTA if someone did that to me then I wouldn\u2019t consider them a friend anymore anyway.", "They almost certainly don\u2019t have the full story.", "Because you have a baby and had two weeks notice... That's more than fair for a reason", "NTA. I wouldn't have let her or anyone go off on me for 5 minutes. I would have hung up long before that. Then, cuz I'm petty, I would have texted her, lack of planning on ur part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine. She knew her MoH was a problem a long time ago and rather than get anyone else to deal with this stuff she waits til 2 weeks b4 her wedding and thene xpects u to drop ur whole life for her. We r adults. We have lives, commitments to others, jobs. Her wedding is Her problem, and she get 1 single day! Not a week, not a month, not a year. 1 day! I wouldn't have gone either. She proved she doesn't value u as a person, she only values what she can get put of u.", "Exactly.  Tell them what she said and when.  She sure as heck won't have told the truth.", "Honestly, I feel like the polite thing after something like that would have been to not attend so that she didn't remember what a jackhole she was being. Additionally, if she was this hard to deal with before the wedding, I am sure she would have started a fight with you at the wedding, gossiped about you to everyone, and you would have \"ruined the wedding\" that way.\n\nYou were in a no win situation, and bowing out gracefully was the best solution.", "Have you spoken to her first MOH?", "She's covering her a$$. Thus way she looks good and u look bad.", "You know she is telling everyone how unreasonable you are, and playing boggle with the truth. \n\nAnd, for some reason, everyone excuses bride behavior after the fact  it is like how woman always would tell me that they don't remember the pain of childbirth, just the joy of the baby. Let me tell you, that shit hurt. Haha.", "ESH. Her behaviour was totally unacceptable and you're right to cut ties. I'm saying E S H because of these remarks:\n\n'girls are usually jealous at the best female Friend'\n\nWe are? Since when? \n\n'I didn't mind, as I was a busy mom already I was just happy she was finally getting married after 11 years of relationship.'\n\n'Finally' ? This just seems judgemental if I'm completely honest. I can't say N T A when you're making catty comments.", "NTA. I read way too quickly and thought she said you were ruining her \"first wedding.\" I was going to give her props for being honest. She sounds like a nightmare. Weddings can bring out the selfish side of people. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and I applaud you for having the courage to cut her off.", ">Here a MOH does pretty much everything the bride asks to\n\nIn the UK? I've never heard of that. Organise the hen night, maybe, but beyond that I've never heard of there being an expectation to put in much work with the wedding itself."]}
