She's hardly ever seen them ever since they were born. So when I said \"it sounded like an insult\" it was accurate because she *does* dislike them although she is against all children. She had also once called them \"crotch goblins\" on one of the rare occasions that they did met.\n\nOkay, so another edit as people seem to be accusing me of \"forcing\" them into it. I never did. I respect her choice. I never asked her to include them or ask her to hold it in a child-free manner. I only said I do not want to attend as it's child-free and as she hates my kids (which is true as she's called them names like \"crotch goblins\", among others).\n\nShe had also made the invite in front of my kids by asking them to be excluded.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy (31) sister Laura (29 F) was getting married. As she's child-free, she informed all of us that she does not want any kids/children at her wedding. My other siblings were fine with it, as they either did not have kids (were child-free themselves) or they agreed to drop them off at home.\n\nShe had informed us by saying that she and her boyfriend David wanted to get married and also set the date, but later mentioned that she wanted it to be child-free so that no one would bring them.\n\nI was not agreeable to that. I told her that while I respect her choice to not have children, I cannot attend her wedding when she's clearly said \"Do not bring your kids\" as that practically sounds like an insult. I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there. I have a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, aged 11.\n\nShe did not take it well. She began to yell at me by saying that she wants everyone to be present there and said things like \"We have not had any issues before, and it's ridiculous of you to pull something like this\", etc. But I did not back down and said that I do not want to argue. I said \"Look, if you want it to be child-free, I do not want to attend. Your option is to make do with the others now.\"\n\nShe was protesting, but in the end she got mad enough and is not talking to me now. My parents are calling me names as well by saying that I should have attended it. The wedding's over and I did not go there. But everyone's saying that I should have respected her wishes, which made me think that I did something wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700930184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183nlhh/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 3632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, it is not an insult to you or your children that she wants a child-free wedding, and you are an asshole for creating an unnecessary issue. If you want to torpedo your relationship with your sister, have at it. You are acting like she routinely behaves terribly towards your children, but you have just decided to take offense over nothing.\n\nYour sister will have to get over you not attending (and quite honestly with your response I personally wouldn\u2019t want you there anyways if it were me), but this is not a slight against you or your children.", ">she's clearly said \"Do not bring your kids\" as that practically sounds like an insult. I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there. \n\nYour sister asked for no children. You are acting like a child, so you didn't attend. Seems appropriate. But your family is also justified in their anger at your childish behavior - it was a general rule, not about your children specifically. Your sister has a right to not want children at her wedding. Do you always make everything all about you? Like you're the \"main character\" or something? My guess is yes.\n\nYTA.", ">*I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there.*\n\nYou make it sound like she's targeting you personally. Or rather, your kids. You can't possibly be the only person in attendance who has kids; theirs aren't allowed, either.\n\nIt's fine if you don't want to go; that's your choice. But don't make it personal when it's not. It's not like she said everyone else can bring their kids, but you alone can't.\n\nYTA for making her wedding choices all about you.", "YTA for letting this become a drama. Child-free weddings are a thing. A lot of couples don't hate kids but want their relatives to enjoy themselves without having to worry about watching the kids. A lot of kids would become bored at a wedding anyway, unless there are specific kid events to do. \n\nYou wouldn't have been an asshole if you had just said that you can't attend, but making it sound as if she personally attacked you and your children makes you the AH.", "YTA \n\nAn invitation is not a summons.  \n\nShe invited you to her wedding, under the condition that she did not want children present.\n\nYou did not find those conditions agreeable.  Fair enough.  That's your right.  \n\nWhat makes you the AH is when, instead of politely declining the invitation, you made HER wedding about YOU, and what YOU wanted.\n\nYour kids are yours.   Your wishes, and what you want, are exactly that.  YOUR wishes.\n\nYou are NOT the main character at someone else's wedding. \n\nStop pretending that everyone else actually cares about whether your kids follow you everywhere.\n\nThey don't.  \n\nThe only one who cares whether your kids are included, is YOU, and by insisting on your kids being included in things they aren't welcome at, or things that aren't child friendly, you are fostering resentment in your family.\n\nPlease read the room.\n\nEta, the original post is different than the one people are seeing at the top of the screen, FYI to everyone, since my comment is top comment \n\nI made my judgment based on the clearly manipulative statement that was included in the post when it was first posted \"you clearly dislike my kids, or they would be invited to your wedding, too\"\n\nWhen this manipulation didn't work, op declined the invitation\n\nTHAT is why I said op was making the wedding about her\n\nI realize now why people are asking\n\nEdited again \n\nTHE ORIGINAL POST SHOULD STILL BE VISIBLE\n\nIt will be in the comments, without any of the edits op made \n\nYou will be able to see the post I made judgment on\n\nEdited, ONCE AGAIN.  \n\nIf you go to the comment DIRECTLY beneath mine, the quote that I have been getting SO MUCH CRAP for\n\nWas taken directly out of the original post, that I don't know how to do, using the blue bar\n\nThe one about, paraphrasing here \"you clearly dislike my kids\".....", "YTA. I thought you were going to say you had a baby or a very young kid and no trusted sitters. But your kids are 11.  You should have got a sitter or seen if they can stay the night at a friend\u2019s house (offer the parents money or to host their kids for a night in return). This has nothing to do with liking your kids. It\u2019s basically about enjoying a party without kids.", "YTA. I had a childfree wedding because I paid for the whole weekend party and I don\u2019t like being around kids. I deal with it for every family holiday like thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, 4th of July, family reunions, etc but my wedding wasn\u2019t about kids or family, it was about me and my spouse. My spouse and I paid for the party so it\u2019s our guest list. \n\nYou chose to make it about you. To put it in perspective, this is like being invited to a Halloween party that\u2019s been designated adults only due to drinking, explicit costumes and music, and you throwing a fit that you can\u2019t bring your kids to some friend of a friends house and that they must hate your kids. The fact is that no one cares about your kids more than you, or as much as you do. And those that don\u2019t enjoy being around kids are entitled to that when they set the guest list for their own party. \n\nIt\u2019s not like specifically your kids weren\u2019t invited - no kids were invited. Kids are loud and messy and prone to causing accidents, and frankly at least on my part, I didn\u2019t want kids around while I wanted to let loose for once and drink and smoke and listen to loud explicit music without worrying about impressionable young minds. \n\nYou missed out on the wedding and that\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve sent the message to your sister that even if she attends family events with kids present outside of her comfort zone, you\u2019ll never make the same grace for her and she likely will now treat you with an attitude of you thinking it\u2019s all about you, all the time. (Which sounds accurate)", "YTA. Children are not obligated entry to spaces simply because they are children. Nor are YOU obligated to accept an invitation for a child free event if you don\u2019t want to. However, you seem to have this mentality that your sister is targeting you and your children. The invitation is for ALL children not just yours. Based upon your edit, you have some things you need to work out with her. I have family i\u2019ve barely seen but still care about, not seeing them a lot does not equate to not caring. Stop taking things so personal and don\u2019t go to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to. Simple", "Yeah, I would say YTA.  Your sister has every right to have her wedding the way she wanted it.  Many weddings are childfree and of no consequence to anyone at all.  You do have the right not to attend, however will have to accept the fallout of your decision.", "YTA. Why in the world did you feel entitled enough to make her wedding about you? Especially enough so to turn it into a big dramatic fallout. That\u2019s wild to me. I\u2019m a mom of 4 young kids, and I love them to death, but if my sister/friend/whoever wanted a child-free wedding? Let me tell you I would be RSVPing so fast \ud83d\ude02 \n\nShe wasn\u2019t \u201ctargeting\u201d you or your kids, she just wanted a chill, adult only environment for one of the few days that is ONLY about her and her husband. It\u2019s not that deep.", "YTA. You're N T A for not going to a wedding if you don't want to, but you're clearly only doing this to be antagonistic as you're offended by the mere premise of a wedding being childfree. You're also projecting so hard that you're saying that she doesnt like your kids since they're not invited. Your kids are 11, you would survive a night out without them", "YTA I mean you are allowed to not attend but you are taking her wanting a child free wedding way to personally. I\u2019m sure you think your kids are amazing and perfect but kids don\u2019t need to be at all social gatherings and honestly probably would hinder the enjoyment of most guests, especially the bride and groom as they specifically don\u2019t want to have kids there", "YTA - it would be fine if you *couldn\u2019t* attend because it was child free, its another to make it such a thing and point of contention. You need to apologize to your sister.", "There was a rule that there be no kids and you have decided to treat that decision as targeting *your* kids because, what, you think she especially hates them? Either way, her wedding is about her and the husband, it\u2019s not an about you. She made a simple request and you got butt hurt because you think you and your kids are special, so you cut off your sister out of spite.\n\nI can already guess that your kids have inherited your entitlement and I bet they\u2019d have been a frigging nightmare. The problem is that some children can be insufferable: special diet, special dispensation for acting like little bastards, screaming, shouting, and sucking the joy out of formal, joyful occasions. We didn\u2019t have kids at our wedding because (a) small church and (b) they can be a pain, and their parents cannot relax. We wanted them to have an opportunity to have a day off. Guess what my cousin did? He didn\u2019t come. He didn\u2019t make a fuss and he didn\u2019t make it about him.\n\nI bet you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re not entitled, yet you said \u201cI was not agreeable to that\u201d as if she was supposed to ask you for approval.  It wasn\u2019t your wedding lady, so you don\u2019t get a say. YTA because you, the older sister, wanted to make this about you. Grow up.", "You think she's not agreeable but you are really doing this to a thing about you and your children. Nobody's children are allowed. You are free to not attend but as well as you want her to do as you wish, you have to respect her wishes and a child free wedding is not uncommon. The day is about her and her boyfriend, not you and your twins, sorry. I have three children, lovely as there is, but I can still respect a child free invitation without making it about me and my children.", "YTA\n\nWake up. Your kids are not the center of the universe.  You could have gotten a sitter for 1 day.

People don't want children disturbing the ceremony, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. Not everyone likes children. YTA, if you can't go, then that's fine. Don't treat it like it's targeted.", "Your sister's wedding is about HER and HER HUSBAND.  You do not get to make demands at someone else's wedding.  What YOU SHOULD have done is politely decline the invite.  Instead you turn it into world war 3, by criticizing her choices, making unnecessary demands, and generally being rude about it.  Apologize to your sister, her husband and your family or lose those relationships.\n\nAnd for future reference, the world does NOT revolve around your children.  Grow up and learn that.\n\nYTA. And a massive one at that.", "YTA I thought you were going to say you had a newborn\u2026 but are you serious? You can\u2019t go to a wedding without your children?? Why are you so offended that they want to enjoy their wedding without children? I have children and I wouldn\u2019t give it a second thought if my siblings had a wedding without children there\u2026. Because it would be their wedding and their choice. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your children.\n\nFrom the way you have behaved about this I feel like the reason they want a Childfree wedding is because of you and your children. I wonder how your children are around family.", "If it was your children specifically she didn\u2019t want to attend, I would understand your hurt and the thought of it being an insult. However, since it\u2019s ALL children are not welcome, then you\u2019re the ahole. A lot of couples have child-free weddings. It\u2019s not personal, but it helps avoid people babysitting at a celebration, children interrupting, etc. it\u2019s not a personal attack in my opinion. So, you are the asshole and if you don\u2019t respect your sister\u2019s wishes, don\u2019t go at all. \n\nAlso, just because you have children doesn\u2019t mean everyone is entitled to be in awe of your children. Some people just genuinely don\u2019t like kids or the idea of having kids, and there is no problem with that.", " YTA\n\nThere are many people who don\u2019t want children at their wedding, and it\u2019s really difficult to tell your friends that they cannot bring their children, while at the same time you\u2019re allowing your siblings to bring their children.  \n\nYou turned this into a personal insult when you said that it was obvious she didn\u2019t like your kids. To me, it sounds like she actually told you the opposite when she said, \u201c We have not had any issues before, and it's ridiculous of you to pull something like this\"\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the costs of feeding everybody at a wedding increases a lot when you allow everybody to bring their children. You cannot target certain people by saying your siblings can bring their children, but other friends cannot bring children. This increases the costs in a major way for a wedding.\n\nThe result is that you made this all about you, but it is HER wedding. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting one of the biggest days of your life to be uncomplicated by not having kids running around. You could\u2019ve just said you couldn\u2019t go, and of course, it\u2019s your right not to go.

You made your choice.", "YTA.  You are wrapping too much of your identity up in being a parent that you think that someone wanting a childfree wedding is a personal insult and you refuse to go, even when it is close family?  Are you really that precious?  \n\n\nName calling is immature, but probably pretty appropriate here.  You are 100% wrong, and very self centered.

As she's child-free, she informed all of us that she does not want any kids/children at her wedding. My other siblings were fine with it, as they either did not have kids (were child-free themselves) or they agreed to drop them off at home.\n\nI was not agreeable to that. I told her that while I respect her choice to not have children, I cannot attend her wedding when she's clearly said \"Do not bring your kids\" as that practically sounds like an insult. I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there. I have a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, aged 11.\n\nShe did not take it well. She began to yell at me by saying that she wants everyone to be present there and said things like \"We have not had any issues before, and it's ridiculous of you to pull something like this\", etc. But I did not back down and said that I do not want to argue. I said \"Look, if you want it to be child-free, I do not want to attend. Your option is to make do with the others now.\"\n\nShe was protesting, but in the end she got mad enough and is not talking to me now. My parents are calling me names as well by saying that I should have attended it. The wedding's over and I did not go there. But everyone's saying that I should have respected her wishes, which made me think that I did something wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not feasible to expect people to be away from their kids like that. Also, you can't be mad at someone declining your request to attend because they don't want kids. You can't have it both ways.

In this world where you literally can't trust anyone with your children, I would absolutely be offended and not attend if someone told me \"don't bring your child\" \nFrankly the idea that having children at your wedding is going to ruin things or make you miserable means that we have a lot of small minded and selfish people.

Children should be able to attend a wedding peaceably and even provide a decent amount of sociability. \nMind you, this is coming from someone who plans outtings with 15 children ranging 5 yo to 11 yo.

Everybody got a plus one to bring a partner/date, but not a +2 or +4, some families are huge.  \nYou can't really allow some kids and not others and if you do allow them it inflates the total really fast.", "Well said!! As a parent, I know my kid is not welcome everywhere so I made arrangements when I needed to.  As said above it is not about YOU.  It is their day and having a bunch of unhappy kids at the wedding sounds like zero fun to me.  Whether your sister likes your kids isn't the point.  It sounds like you never tell your kids no and that they literally go everywhere with you.  IMO that is awful parenting.  The world is not going to treat them like you do and you are setting them up for failure.  Kids need to know boundaries and your sister and her soon-to-be husband are setting boundaries for THEIR day.   You sound like you are the problem.  Imagine being so selfish you only think about what YOU want at SOMEONE ELSE'S wedding!!  \n\nYTA.", "\"I wasn't agreeable to that.\" No one cares whether you agree or not. Frankly, I think your ah move in this case probably made your sister's wedding BETTER as she didn't have to deal with the likes of you!", "I think there is also INFO missing.  How difficult would it be to not bring the kids?  If you have 1 year to line up a sitter for one afternoon, and then choose not to do that, then that says something about how much you prioritize the wedding and the sister's wishes.  On the other hand, an overnight stay away from your kids or trying to get a sitter in a place that is foreign to you is a bigger ask. \n\nMy daughter's school (you know, a place designed for kids where all the adults either have kids or work with kids) hosts a child-free fancy fundraiser every year.  Everyone gets a sitter for one evening, and it's a blast to socialize with all the parents while being able to have a complete thought.  If a *school* can have a 4-hour, child-free event once per year then I think OP could attend a wedding if *she wanted to be there.*", "Most of the time in these cases there's no AH, but in this case, OP is so clearly YTA about this.", "Thank you!!! Many couples choose to have child free weddings and I gotta say I get why. It\u2019s a different kind of celebration when there are no kids. \nI just don\u2019t get why you were so offended by it?

I\u2019m sorry, the entitlement of some parents scrambles my brain. I had a child free wedding and distant relations of my husband that my MIL invited decided to bring their kids, one was maybe 7-8 and the other was 10. Kid interrupted my husbands wedding vows. \n\nIn the end, not a huge deal, but what the fuck. Also these people left mid way through dinner (not because of my the kids) and I\u2019ve never seen them again, nor are they close to my husband. What was the point? \n\nIn contrast my husbands best friend (who is also my close friend) had his sisters kids at his wedding. They were well behaved and his BIL took them home early to the hotel so my friend\u2019s sister could stay out. \n\nThere is a way to do this, but the entitlement blows my mind. YTA. It\u2019s not your wedding.", "I only saw the edited post and still agree with you. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bride likes kids or not. It is a child free event and that\u2019s not a difficult request to appease. \n\nOP is selfish and childish", "I wholeheartedly agree. OP was an AH about trying to make someone else's wedding about her. Many people love the opportunity to do something without their children. My parents went to numerous weddings without me and my brother. They didn't make a scene about it and neither did we. There's nothing insulting about wanting a child free wedding. Perhaps OP needs to take off her rose tinted glasses and accept her twins are not the little darlings she thinks they are.", "This is exactly right. N T A if it being child free simply didn\u2019t work for your family. It can be hard to get childcare, separation anxiety exists, etc.\n\nYTA for making this all about you and being disrespectful of her choice to have it child free.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to attend, but you can\u2019t pitch a fit either", "It's not even an issue with child care or a nursing baby. She wants her kids there just \"because\"....Girl should have gone and had a great time without kids hanging on her leg but now the whole family is mad at her and she still doubling down.

She should have come to Reddit BEFORE the wedding to see what an ass she's being.", "Honestly, OP sounds insufferable. I\u2019m starting to think the reason her sister doesn\u2019t like children has less to do with the children and more to do with an entitled parent.", "Spot on, my friend.

That's her SISTER, not some old high school friend.  Unless it was a prohibitively expensive destination wedding, they've been estranged for years due to abuse or some other extreme circumstance... I mean, how does anyone justify snubbing their sister's wedding just because it's child-free?  \"I really wish I could, but 6 months is just not enough time for me to line up a sitter...?\" What a shitty way to tell your sibling that their lifelong happiness is of absolutely no importance.", "Agree on YTA. The fact that OP quotes her sister saying:\n\n> We have not had any issues before, and it\u2019s ridiculous of you to pull something like this\u201d\n\nmakes me wonder if that line was OP\u2019s sister saying that they/the family have previously had adults only events before without any issues of OP/other siblings being unable to attend if they couldn\u2019t bring their children. That would make the other half of the quote, calling OP ridiculous for pulling something like this, make even more sense. \n\nIt would certainly be upsetting to find out that your sibling who you know *can and has* gone to adult only events without their 11 year old children without issues in the past, suddenly decide that they absolutely cannot and will not attend your wedding without their two 11 year old children in tow. A situation like that, without a serious change in circumstances impacting childcare between the last time they attended adults only events, would very much come off as OP exploiting the fact that her sister had wanted her at the wedding to demand her children be included.", "Thanks for adding this!

Living in a large metropolitan area in the western US, I have never attended a child free wedding in my life, and have only heard about them on Reddit - the one place where I only hear about certain topics and never ever experience them in real life. All the weddings I have ever been to are family oriented - which means kids, lots of kids. They are great fun at weddings and help alleviate any boredom. Usually, when something \u201cbad\u201d happens, it\u2019s the drunk uncle or some other adult stirring up drama or doing something dumb - not a kid. So people trying to keep kids from ruining something makes no sense to me. It\u2019s the adults who are usually the problems.

Receptions can go on longer and have dancing and adults don't want to have to worry about looking after their kids. Maybe in southern Europe kids behave better.

But telling someone they are having; your kids aren't invited, in front of the kids is insulting. Kids aren't lesser than/not people.

Also the way the sister treats OPs kids it's understandable to me that OP would take things sister says as an insult more easily.\n\nBut the fact the sister starts yelling is just crazy to me.

OP has every right to not attend the wedding, but became the AH by making it about her and what she wants. She turned it into a family wide issue instead of just saying that she won\u2019t be attending. OP needs to admit that she blew this up into a problem and apologize. It\u2019s sad that she didn\u2019t attend her sister\u2019s wedding out of spite because she couldn\u2019t get her way.

They really do everything they can to keep him in line, but it\u2019s almost impossible. The thought of him being at a wedding alone is enough for me to say no children allowed at an event.

She did.", "I wouldn\u2019t go to my sister\u2019s wedding if you paid me because she treated me like trash. You don\u2019t know someone\u2019s circumstances.", "I'm just now seeing the edit. I just comment and go about my day. If she's not a kid person in general, then op doesn't need to take it so personally.", "Because this is Reddit and the only demographic Reddit hates more than children is parents", "I feel like if I were a parent I\u2019d be stoked to drop my kids off at a babysitters place and going to an adult function with adults and drink and swear and talk about the crazy health insurance premiums.", "I'm doing a 13+ age limit for mine. That way there aren't any \"exceptions\" being made for teenage family members who will be part of the wedding party (youngest will be 14) and while most of the younger children amongst my extended family members are pretty chill, there are one or two who I don't trust completely to not cause trouble/not have their parent(s) blame me or the venue if they cause trouble rather than apologizing for their kid (I'm a teacher and I see parents try to pull that move WAY too often so I'm quite jaded). Most all of my relatives I don't expect to have any problem with it...the same can't be said for all of their spouses, but I can't exactly say I'll be sorry if said spouses decide to stay home with the kids while the person I'm actually related to attends solo...", "Worse. Where's little Billy? What was that crash!? \n\n*\"It was an accident, and it's only a cake! He just wanted a slice. Are you really going to make a huge deal about this? You're going to get angry at a little boy for tryin to get a slice of cake? You're an adult, grow up.\"*", "Ooooo. I feel like OP is definitely projecting a bit. Maybe she\u2019s wishing she didn\u2019t have kids \ud83d\ude02", "I really wish more parents would frame it like this. Instead of \"my child is being excluded from this event\", CF weddings mean \"this event isn't appropriate for children\", just like an R rating on a movie.", "same, my spouse and I got married at a nice venue designed for adults, had an open bar, and didn't plan on playing \"clean\" edits of music to dance to - completely not the environment for kids.", "Nah. Babysitters were the worst. Pretty much ignored us and watched tv and tried to put us to bed early. (I\u2019m old and this was pre cell phone era so they couldn\u2019t be on their phones or texting). I only recall one nice baby sitter ever, so not fun.", "Shit, I\u2019d pay for a sitter in a heartbeat but I sure as shit don\u2019t trust the in-laws and don\u2019t think there is any fair amount of money for 1 person (especially a teenager) to have to keep 3 kids alive and get them to bed. It just won\u2019t happen at their ages (particularly the 1 yo).\n\nTherefore if anyone invites me to a child free wedding, the answer is \u201csorry, we can\u2019t make it\u201d.", "OP doesn\u2019t care, parents view kids as show pieces to trot out at events like this.  When I was 10, I was forced to participate in a wedding.  And as such there are pictures of me looking bored AF and unhappy in a dress.  Children that age may be old enough to behave properly if they have basic manners and don\u2019t have a developmental issue, but it is still not appropriate to bring them.  They will be miserable.  No one even thinks about that, though.  It\u2019s all about getting them dressed up and forcing them to perform and/or marching them around to show them off.", "They're twins, she wants to dress them in cute, matching clothes and showcase them to everyone as her darling little possessions.", "I loved weddings and adult parties as a child, because I've always seen myself as an adult trapped in a child's body for my childhood. Loved a party where I got to meet interesting adults.", "But so is just not attending if the event isn\u2019t appropriate. I personally turn down invites to events for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes because I\u2019d rather hang out with my kid. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNow OP could have declined and just not said anything about why\u2026which is that what most people would do but between siblings I feel like people are a little more open and sometimes whine to each other. So she didn\u2019t need to complain but declining to go is totally fine.", "Oh! I didn\u2019t know, I looked for OP\u2019s replies and didn\u2019t see them lol. Kids were literally her own choice. Idk why she feels she\u2019s entitled enough to bring them. If a chose to have kids (I absolutely do not want any), I\u2019d respect the no kids rule. I feel kids wouldn\u2019t have fun at a wedding anyway, they\u2019d be so bored", "I was 8 as well when I went to my cousin\u2019s wedding. I vaguely remember seeing her in her dress and sitting in a pew. That\u2019s it. I remember much more after the wedding when we were with another cousin who was the babysitter while the adults went to the reception. Playing at Grandma\u2019s house with all the other kids was much more fun.", "Oh sure, and that\u2019s where OP is wrong. Declining is fine, but it\u2019s the snippy \u201cwell I wouldn\u2019t want to attend an event where my children aren\u2019t welcome anyways\u201d retort that makes her TA. That\u2019s completely unnecessary and melodramatic", "Irish / Dutch Catholic family, kids are at the weddings, skittering around the dance floor before the real dancing starts. Eating fancy food, falling asleep on a pile of coats.\n\nNot everyone loves that sort of thing, but our family weddings tend to include the entire family.", "I'm not sure they are even still up, tbh let me look lol\n\nSame on your other points though \n\nI am child free for medical reasons and by choice, but even if I did have kids\n\nSomeone else's wedding isn't about me\n\nI will follow their rules", "saving the birds ahaha i love this\ud83e\udd23", "The kids at my daughter\u2019s wedding all had a blast.  But, then, it was on a lawn adjoining a beach, and they were in bathing suits, there were kayaks and sail boats to play in\u2026the adults had a lot of fun, too!", "Rofl. You let the intrusive thoughts win!\nDamn childhood.", "My niece was combination flower girl and ring bearer.  If we'd had more guests she would have been an usher by her own choice too.  She was only 6 but she treated that day like it was her *job,* man.", "Kids were always accommodated at weddings. Even in white Christian weddings there are flower girls tradition. It does imply kids were always expected to attend."]}
