{"id": 31695, "submission_id": "183nlhh", "title": "AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding because she wanted it to be child free?", "selftext": "**EDIT:** It was not just my children, but she does hate them anyway. She's hardly ever seen them ever since they were born. So when I said \"it sounded like an insult\" it was accurate because she *does* dislike them although she is against all children. She had also once called them \"crotch goblins\" on one of the rare occasions that they did met.\n\nOkay, so another edit as people seem to be accusing me of \"forcing\" them into it. I never did. I respect her choice. I never asked her to include them or ask her to hold it in a child-free manner. I only said I do not want to attend as it's child-free and as she hates my kids (which is true as she's called them names like \"crotch goblins\", among others).\n\nShe had also made the invite in front of my kids by asking them to be excluded.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy (31) sister Laura (29 F) was getting married. As she's child-free, she informed all of us that she does not want any kids/children at her wedding. My other siblings were fine with it, as they either did not have kids (were child-free themselves) or they agreed to drop them off at home.\n\nShe had informed us by saying that she and her boyfriend David wanted to get married and also set the date, but later mentioned that she wanted it to be child-free so that no one would bring them.\n\nI was not agreeable to that. I told her that while I respect her choice to not have children, I cannot attend her wedding when she's clearly said \"Do not bring your kids\" as that practically sounds like an insult. I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there. I have a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, aged 11.\n\nShe did not take it well. She began to yell at me by saying that she wants everyone to be present there and said things like \"We have not had any issues before, and it's ridiculous of you to pull something like this\", etc. But I did not back down and said that I do not want to argue. I said \"Look, if you want it to be child-free, I do not want to attend. Your option is to make do with the others now.\"\n\nShe was protesting, but in the end she got mad enough and is not talking to me now. My parents are calling me names as well by saying that I should have attended it. The wedding's over and I did not go there. But everyone's saying that I should have respected her wishes, which made me think that I did something wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700930184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183nlhh/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 986, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, it is not an insult to you or your children that she wants a child-free wedding, and you are an asshole for creating an unnecessary issue. If you want to torpedo your relationship with your sister, have at it. You are acting like she routinely behaves terribly towards your children, but you have just decided to take offense over nothing.\n\nYour sister will have to get over you not attending (and quite honestly with your response I personally wouldn\u2019t want you there anyways if it were me), but this is not a slight against you or your children.", ">she's clearly said \"Do not bring your kids\" as that practically sounds like an insult. I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there. \n\nYour sister asked for no children. You are acting like a child, so you didn't attend. Seems appropriate. But your family is also justified in their anger at your childish behavior - it was a general rule, not about your children specifically. Your sister has a right to not want children at her wedding. Do you always make everything all about you? Like you're the \"main character\" or something? My guess is yes.\n\nYTA.", ">*I mentioned that I do not want to do so when she clearly dislikes my children enough to want them to be present there.*\n\nYou make it sound like she's targeting you personally. Or rather, your kids. You can't possibly be the only person in attendance who has kids; theirs aren't allowed, either.\n\nIt's fine if you don't want to go; that's your choice. But don't make it personal when it's not. It's not like she said everyone else can bring their kids, but you alone can't.\n\nYTA for making her wedding choices all about you.", "YTA for letting this become a drama. Child-free weddings are a thing. A lot of couples don't hate kids but want their relatives to enjoy themselves without having to worry about watching the kids. A lot of kids would become bored at a wedding anyway, unless there are specific kid events to do. \n\nYou wouldn't have been an asshole if you had just said that you can't attend, but making it sound as if she personally attacked you and your children makes you the AH.", "YTA \n\nAn invitation is not a summons.  \n\nShe invited you to her wedding, under the condition that she did not want children present.\n\nYou did not find those conditions agreeable.  Fair enough.  That's your right.  \n\nWhat makes you the AH is when, instead of politely declining the invitation, you made HER wedding about YOU, and what YOU wanted.\n\nYour kids are yours.   Your wishes, and what you want, are exactly that.  YOUR wishes.\n\nYou are NOT the main character at someone else's wedding. \n\nStop pretending that everyone else actually cares about whether your kids follow you everywhere.\n\nThey don't.  \n\nThe only one who cares whether your kids are included, is YOU, and by insisting on your kids being included in things they aren't welcome at, or things that aren't child friendly, you are fostering resentment in your family.\n\nPlease read the room.", "YTA. I thought you were going to say you had a baby or a very young kid and no trusted sitters. But your kids are 11.  You should have got a sitter or seen if they can stay the night at a friend\u2019s house (offer the parents money or to host their kids for a night in return). This has nothing to do with liking your kids. It\u2019s basically about enjoying a party without kids.", "YTA. I had a childfree wedding because I paid for the whole weekend party and I don\u2019t like being around kids. I deal with it for every family holiday like thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, 4th of July, family reunions, etc but my wedding wasn\u2019t about kids or family, it was about me and my spouse. My spouse and I paid for the party so it\u2019s our guest list. \n\nYou chose to make it about you. To put it in perspective, this is like being invited to a Halloween party that\u2019s been designated adults only due to drinking, explicit costumes and music, and you throwing a fit that you can\u2019t bring your kids to some friend of a friends house and that they must hate your kids. The fact is that no one cares about your kids more than you, or as much as you do. And those that don\u2019t enjoy being around kids are entitled to that when they set the guest list for their own party. \n\nIt\u2019s not like specifically your kids weren\u2019t invited - no kids were invited. Kids are loud and messy and prone to causing accidents, and frankly at least on my part, I didn\u2019t want kids around while I wanted to let loose for once and drink and smoke and listen to loud explicit music without worrying about impressionable young minds. \n\nYou missed out on the wedding and that\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve sent the message to your sister that even if she attends family events with kids present outside of her comfort zone, you\u2019ll never make the same grace for her and she likely will now treat you with an attitude of you thinking it\u2019s all about you, all the time. (Which sounds accurate)", "YTA. Children are not obligated entry to spaces simply because they are children. Nor are YOU obligated to accept an invitation for a child free event if you don\u2019t want to. However, you seem to have this mentality that your sister is targeting you and your children. The invitation is for ALL children not just yours. Based upon your edit, you have some things you need to work out with her. I have family i\u2019ve barely seen but still care about, not seeing them a lot does not equate to not caring. Stop taking things so personal and don\u2019t go to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to. Simple", "Yeah, I would say YTA.  Your sister has every right to have her wedding the way she wanted it.  Many weddings are childfree and of no consequence to anyone at all.  You do have the right not to attend, however will have to accept the fallout of your decision.", "YTA. Why in the world did you feel entitled enough to make her wedding about you? Especially enough so to turn it into a big dramatic fallout. That\u2019s wild to me. I\u2019m a mom of 4 young kids, and I love them to death, but if my sister/friend/whoever wanted a child-free wedding? Let me tell you I would be RSVPing so fast \ud83d\ude02 \n\nShe wasn\u2019t \u201ctargeting\u201d you or your kids, she just wanted a chill, adult only environment for one of the few days that is ONLY about her and her husband. It\u2019s not that deep.", "YTA. You're N T A for not going to a wedding if you don't want to, but you're clearly only doing this to be antagonistic as you're offended by the mere premise of a wedding being childfree. You're also projecting so hard that you're saying that she doesnt like your kids since they're not invited. Your kids are 11, you would survive a night out without them", "YTA I mean you are allowed to not attend but you are taking her wanting a child free wedding way to personally. I\u2019m sure you think your kids are amazing and perfect but kids don\u2019t need to be at all social gatherings and honestly probably would hinder the enjoyment of most guests, especially the bride and groom as they specifically don\u2019t want to have kids there", "YTA - it would be fine if you *couldn\u2019t* attend because it was child free, its another to make it such a thing and point of contention. You need to apologize to your sister.", "There was a rule that there be no kids and you have decided to treat that decision as targeting *your* kids because, what, you think she especially hates them? Either way, her wedding is about her and the husband, it\u2019s not an about you. She made a simple request and you got butt hurt because you think you and your kids are special, so you cut off your sister out of spite.\n\nI can already guess that your kids have inherited your entitlement and I bet they\u2019d have been a frigging nightmare. The problem is that some children can be insufferable: special diet, special dispensation for acting like little bastards, screaming, shouting, and sucking the joy out of formal, joyful occasions. We didn\u2019t have kids at our wedding because (a) small church and (b) they can be a pain, and their parents cannot relax. We wanted them to have an opportunity to have a day off. Guess what my cousin did? He didn\u2019t come. He didn\u2019t make a fuss and he didn\u2019t make it about him.\n\nI bet you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re not entitled, yet you said \u201cI was not agreeable to that\u201d as if she was supposed to ask you for approval.  It wasn\u2019t your wedding lady, so you don\u2019t get a say. YTA because you, the older sister, wanted to make this about you. Grow up.", "You think she's not agreeable but you are really doing this to a thing about you and your children. Nobody's children are allowed. You are free to not attend but as well as you want her to do as you wish, you have to respect her wishes and a child free wedding is not uncommon. The day is about her and her boyfriend, not you and your twins, sorry. I have three children, lovely as there is, but I can still respect a child free invitation without making it about me and my children.", "YTA\n\nWake up. Your kids are not the center of the universe.  You could have gotten a sitter for 1 day.  Now your entire family thinks you suck and rightfully so", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s an invitation, you are allowed to decline just as your sister is allowed to set boundaries about who she does and doesn\u2019t want there. This wasn\u2019t just about *YOU* and *YOUR* kids, she didn\u2019t want *ANYONES* kids there. If you feel insulted over that\u2026 That\u2019s on you. A wedding isn\u2019t really a place for children  and a lot of parents who think they\u2019re entitled to say \u201cwell, if my kid isn\u2019t welcome, then I\u2019m not welcome and I\u2019m not going\u201d and push the couple to allow their children to go\u2026 are the same people who make their kids everyone else\u2019s problem at the wedding and don\u2019t watch them. \n\nThis was her day. This wasn\u2019t about you and the kids. People are allowed to not like or want children around, especially at their wedding. Just like you\u2019re allowed to decline the invitation. No need to act like a child and make it so much worse. But, since you want to act like a child about the situation, it\u2019s for the best you didn\u2019t go. \n\nMy brother did this to me during my wedding. I eventually concluded that his kids could come to the ceremony, but not the reception. Then once at the wedding and as I was getting my photos done, he sends our sister over to ask \u201cif they could stay for the rest, since they are already here and they\u2019ve drove such a long way\u201d. Which once again, I allowed and I\u2019ve been pissed off about it ever since. This was one of few final nails in the coffin of our relationship. If you can\u2019t respect me and my wishes during one of the biggest days of my life, then, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll respect me for the small moments either.", "Their wedding, their rules\u2026 Your decision whether to attend is the only thing you need to be considering.", "Child-free weddings are pretty normal these days. People don't want children disturbing the ceremony, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. Not everyone likes children. YTA, if you can't go, then that's fine. Don't treat it like it's targeted.", "Your sister's wedding is about HER and HER HUSBAND.  You do not get to make demands at someone else's wedding.  What YOU SHOULD have done is politely decline the invite.  Instead you turn it into world war 3, by criticizing her choices, making unnecessary demands, and generally being rude about it.  Apologize to your sister, her husband and your family or lose those relationships.\n\nAnd for future reference, the world does NOT revolve around your children.  Grow up and learn that.\n\nYTA. And a massive one at that.", "YTA I thought you were going to say you had a newborn\u2026 but are you serious? You can\u2019t go to a wedding without your children?? Why are you so offended that they want to enjoy their wedding without children? I have children and I wouldn\u2019t give it a second thought if my siblings had a wedding without children there\u2026. Because it would be their wedding and their choice. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your children.\n\nFrom the way you have behaved about this I feel like the reason they want a Childfree wedding is because of you and your children. I wonder how your children are around family.", "If it was your children specifically she didn\u2019t want to attend, I would understand your hurt and the thought of it being an insult. However, since it\u2019s ALL children are not welcome, then you\u2019re the ahole. A lot of couples have child-free weddings. It\u2019s not personal, but it helps avoid people babysitting at a celebration, children interrupting, etc. it\u2019s not a personal attack in my opinion. So, you are the asshole and if you don\u2019t respect your sister\u2019s wishes, don\u2019t go at all. \n\nAlso, just because you have children doesn\u2019t mean everyone is entitled to be in awe of your children. Some people just genuinely don\u2019t like kids or the idea of having kids, and there is no problem with that.", " YTA\n\nThere are many people who don\u2019t want children at their wedding, and it\u2019s really difficult to tell your friends that they cannot bring their children, while at the same time you\u2019re allowing your siblings to bring their children.  \n\nYou turned this into a personal insult when you said that it was obvious she didn\u2019t like your kids. To me, it sounds like she actually told you the opposite when she said, \u201c We have not had any issues before, and it's ridiculous of you to pull something like this\"\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the costs of feeding everybody at a wedding increases a lot when you allow everybody to bring their children. You cannot target certain people by saying your siblings can bring their children, but other friends cannot bring children. This increases the costs in a major way for a wedding.\n\nThe result is that you made this all about you, but it is HER wedding. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting one of the biggest days of your life to be uncomplicated by not having kids running around. You could\u2019ve just said you couldn\u2019t go, and of course, it\u2019s your right not to go. But just think about how you\u2019re letting your sister down on her big day.", "Kids do not belong at everything.  If your sister didn't want them there, you either get a sitter or don't attend.    You made your choice.", "YTA.  You are wrapping too much of your identity up in being a parent that you think that someone wanting a childfree wedding is a personal insult and you refuse to go, even when it is close family?  Are you really that precious?  \n\n\nName calling is immature, but probably pretty appropriate here.  You are 100% wrong, and very self centered.  I suspect that you are going to start being distanced from family events due to your toxicity.", "Just because people want kid free weddings doesn't always mean they don't like kids. YTA.", "INFO: What\u2019s the issue? Are they banning you from events? She said no children. You said, I can\u2019t attend without my children have a great time. Then you preceded to not go.

But yeah, having to sit still for even 15 minutes can be annoying for a child.", "I addressed this with another person \n\nI should have worded my comment better\n\nIf they had declined the invitation, and people asked why and they said \"because the child free thing doesn't work for me\" they will appear to be the asshole to some people who don't understand why you prioritize your kids\n\nBut they would not be the AH in this situation", "That is YOUR culture \n\nProjection much?", "That may be so, but it doesn't appear to be the situation here.", "THIS", "Your comment was fine. Ppl are acting deliberately obtuse.", "You know, I find it\u2026 curious how you can\u2019t see the hypocrisy in your statement. Is it an invitation or a summons? You have *no right* to both demand someone\u2019s presence *and* place stipulations upon them that they may not agree to without being called out on it. If you were raised in a culture that doesn\u2019t see the children in the family as equal participants in family events, that\u2019s your prerogative. Just as it\u2019s the prerogative of those of us who *were* to decline to participate.", "Thank you, i am getting really sick of justifying myself", "It is an invitation, not a summons \n\nI said op was the AH for HOW she declined the invitation, not the fact that she declined at all, did you read my entire post?"]}
