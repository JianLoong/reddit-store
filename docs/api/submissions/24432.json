Our boss is amazing and he really takes care of his employees. Everyday, lunch is provided. The Menu is sent out a week in advance so we know what is available.\n\nNow, I should note that I am vegan, (I am not a preachy vegan and I don't care what people eat) and while there is always a vegetarian option, there is not always a vegan option. To the chef's credit he does try to remember that I and a handful of others are vegan and will try to make vegan options as often as he can.\n\nThe issue is that sometimes I really just don't like what the vegan option is. I'm by no means picky, but more often than not, the vegan option has eggplant in it, I hate eggplant, and on Fridays when they do Breakfast for lunch, the vegan option is avocado toast, I hate avocados. I have just started to pack my lunch and treat it as an option in case I can't eat what is available. The microwave to heat up my lunch is in the lunch room where the chef is with the food that he has prepared, so I'm essentially heating up food in front of the chef. He has never said anything but a couple of my coworkers have began to ask me why I am always packing my lunch when it is free and provided. I explained and they said that I'm an AH because the chef is watching me ignore food he prepared for something I brought from home. I usually bring leftovers but sometimes I will heat up a GardeIn thing like vegan sliders.\n\nI don't think, I'm the AH because I have to eat and I don't want to be hungry at work. Some have suggested I take a plate and then just throw it away so I'm not rude, but nothing makes me more angry than wasting food.

Free lunch is a great benefit when it's something you like, but it's ridiculous for your co-workers to treat it like an obligation.

I don't want to come across as picky at all, but I'm just not a fan of eggplant or avocado, so when those are the only vegan options, I just like to have a back-up plan, it has nothing to do with your food or skills at all. Please don't be offended.\"\n\nThe chef will understand and will maybe even come up with a few more vegan ideas that don't include avocado or eggplant. I think the problem is avoiding openly speaking about. You're all adults here, just explain why you're bringing food.", "NTA\n\nYour co workers are being overly sensitive.", "NTA the chef doesn't have an issue with it", "Nta. It's great that lunch is provided, but you can't be forced to eat it.", "NTA - but maybe bring a cold lunch on those days?", "NTA.  I've done the same when lunch is brought on and I don't like the options. I'm neither vegetarian nor vegan. If you don\u2019t like the food, you don't like the food, but you gotta eat. The rest can go hang.", "NTA, and if anyone keep pestering you, tell the chef that *they're* the ones telling you to literally throw his food away.", "NTA but have you told the chef politely? He shouldn't be expected to have to manage picky eating on top of multiple diet options but you could just politely say you're a bit picky and might sometimes just eat your own food. Least then you aren't blanking his efforts in front of him.", "NTA. Trust a Chef is not going to be offended when you bring your own food. They automatically assume you either have some bizarre food preferences, like one person I know who can't stand onions, or you have specific dietary restrictions, like my food allergies.", "Nope, NTA whatsoever! And I highly doubt the chef truly cares.", "NTA. If you don't care for the food, you don't care for the food. Taking a plate and throwing it away is a horrible idea!

I wouldn't eat eggplant either! I had to follow a gluten free diet for a short while and literally just cut anything with gluten out of my life because using a gluten free alternative was just such a traumatic assault on my taste buds, I just couldn't handle it.  If chef asks you can always just be honest, he's probably just cooking \"a vegan option\" and not really thinking that maybe not all vegans actually enjoy it. If somebody else complains ask if you can order their lunch next week so that they don't get options either.", "NTA    you are a grownup, there is no reason to pretend you like food, that you don't actually like.\n\nAny chef will understand they can't expect everyone will love every dish they make, and won't be offended by it. \n\nI'm with you on the eggplant, my whole family likes it, and I think it's gross.", "I\u2019m sure the chef is probably more understanding that they realize..NTA.", "NTA,  what are you supposed to do? Throw a tantrum if there isn't a vegan option? No, you brought a lunch for your dietary preferences.  So NTA.", "Jesus, wasting food to not hurt anyone\u2019s feelings?

Cooking the food that the company has ordered is their job. Policing the people who eat it is not. You are under no obligation to explain why you are bringing food. \n\nThat said, chefs do want you to enjoy the food, so if you are one of a few vegans, it might be worth mentioning that you don't care for eggplant.
