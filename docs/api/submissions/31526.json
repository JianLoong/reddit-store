I think I may be the asshole because I didn't reach out to the inlaws after asking my partner/their son/my baby's dad to do so. \n\nMaybe I am the asshole for expecting him to communicate knowing he probably wouldn't and allowing them to buy the food despite knowing our baby wouldn't be well enough to go. I suppose that is a matter of opinion, and dad thinks she's improving and will be fine but I am default and mom so I see the unguarded demeanor and condition of her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
