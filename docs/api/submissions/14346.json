That MIL sounds like a real piece of work.  \n\nIt's your house, she doesn't get to tell you how to clean it.", "NTA. Maybe ask her why she never taught her son these skills if it's so important. You are his wife, not his maid. He is a grown man capable of picking up after/taking care of himself. And if he isn't, then you don't have a husband, you have a child.\n\nI am a lazy person myself. My partner does the full-time stay-at-home parent thing and I work, but I still do whatever I can to make my partner's life easier because I know the work is not easy. Especially the simple things \\[ex. rinse off my dishes so they don't crust, put my clothes in a hamper, make a plate for them at dinner, etc.\\] It takes two seconds to be considerate toward your partner.\n\nAs for the whole MIL situation, she sounds very controlling and this might not be the best environment for you guys to be in.

I understand why she\u2019s mad. At the root of it, he\u2019s being a bad roommate. Whether you should clean up after him is a discussion you should have with your husband. \n\n> then she called me a bitch. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty rude and uncalled for. She shouldn\u2019t have done that. \n\nESH. Tell your husband to clean up his sh*t so his mom leaves you alone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: changing to NTA since it\u2019s your house.
