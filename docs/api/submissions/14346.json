My partner does the full-time stay-at-home parent thing and I work, but I still do whatever I can to make my partner's life easier because I know the work is not easy. Especially the simple things \\[ex. rinse off my dishes so they don't crust, put my clothes in a hamper, make a plate for them at dinner, etc.\\] It takes two seconds to be considerate toward your partner.\n\nAs for the whole MIL situation, she sounds very controlling and this might not be the best environment for you guys to be in.

I understand why she\u2019s mad. At the root of it, he\u2019s being a bad roommate. Whether you should clean up after him is a discussion you should have with your husband. \n\n> then she called me a bitch. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty rude and uncalled for. She shouldn\u2019t have done that. \n\nESH. Tell your husband to clean up his sh*t so his mom leaves you alone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: changing to NTA since it\u2019s your house.

MIL is projecting on you. She sounds more than a bit misogynistic. She's disabled so can no longer pick up after her son's who both think they don't have to pick up after themselves. Meanwhile you're a mother, studying full time and having to take care care of not only your own children but her and her kids as well.\n\nTry a few things if you aren't already at the end of your rope. Family therapy, couples therapy, chore charts, teaching your husband and BiL life skills she should have taught them etc.\n\nIf none of those things work, speak to a lawyer.

He is manipulating you, bc the real issue is that if he picked up his clothing, there wouldn\u2019t be a fight.  Don\u2019t take that bait - you\u2019re not asking him to choose between you and his mom, you\u2019re telling him that if he refuses to clean up after himself as a whole ass person who lives in the same house, you will remove yourself from the situation.\n\nMIL sounds like she\u2019s misdirecting her irritation too, and she shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on you.
