He's become the \"breadwinner\" if you will although I still contribute with my savings! I also do 80% of child-care and chores.\n\n\nLong story short, He wanted me and my kids to attend thanksgiving with his family who are located across country and we were supposed to go yesterday (ahead of time to get a rental place). He bokked our tickets and everything but later, before the flight I found out that he, his kids and myself were put in 1st class whilst my 2 kids (14) & (10) were put in economy. I was stunned, he acted like it was a no big deal and told us it's just few hours and the kids could \"just hang in there for a little while\". I asked how he could think this was acceptable and he got mad and said he's the one paying for tickets then we go by his rules. I immediately turned around and took the kids and made my way out of the airport. He started following us screaming at me to go back but I refused and told him that I no longer felt like spending thanksgiving with his folks after this. My youngest cried because she never flew without me.\n\n\nHe went with his kids. My and the kids are home. He has not stop calling trying to berate me and even had his mom text that I needed to get over myself and stop teaching my kids to be spoiled and entitled. She said that the fact that I was \"willing\" to miss thanksgiving with the family over something so trivial shows my real character and perseonality and mindset or \"lack thereof\". I have not replied but I feel horrible.\n\nAITA, should I have just let it slide and just went? In case I wasn't clear, ME AND THE KIDS LEFT OUR FAMILY/HOMETOWN SO WE COULD GO CELEBRATE WITH HIS FAMILY IN HIS HOMETOWN. My kids weren't too excited leaving their granparents for a week or so.\n\n\n**UPDATE I'm currently getting myself and the kids packed so that we go stay with my mother. This has happened BEFORE in other instances but I kept thinking to myself \"this is not right but I have invested too much time and effort in this relationship so maybe this shouldn't get in the way\"..and I'd try to minimize most situations where I find my kids being put last. Not only that but he tried to give me an ultimatum regarding getting my degree and what was my response? \"This isn't right....\" but kept making light of it and letting go. Now he's probably badmouthing me to the whole family (and so is his mom, bless her effing heart)The kids and I are leaving, He'll be coming back to an empty home...except he'll find some company with the engagement ring that I took off and left on the nightstand. Distance and some re-evaluation is needed right now. Thank ypu to all who reached out with helpful input and prespectives. You're right, my kids come first and that's what I keep trying to do and I hope I won't ever fail.

What else does he do to make them feel second class and why are you allowing this?", "So his mother told you that you're acting entitled because you wanted your children to have the same treatment as his children?  Yeah that's a hard no. You should have told her if flying 1st class makes you entitled then what are he and his children. The only reason she said that is because they're her grandchildren and your kids aren't. I believe the writings on the wall with this one.

Not only is that wrong, imagine how OP'S kids feel. The person they're trying to get to know and flying to meet his family doesn't even care if they sit with him or their own mom. On top of that, I know adults afraid to fly, especially alone. I cant imagine doing that to a kid, especially unpromted. It's also a safety concern. Usually airplane seats are in 3, so they would have to sit next to a stranger. What if the stranger was creepy or rude? The adults they came with aren't even in the same class.

My own mother's excuse was flimsy. She made more than enough to live on, especially back then. I have been exactly there, and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. You deserved a good life.", "They were clearly trying to send a smoke signal for help to put out the fire \ud83d\ude44", "\"This dude's an AH 100%\"\n\"So you should go do what he does!\"\n\nGotta love Reddit.", "Thank you. Later on, when I had moved out, I managed to have an ok relationship with him. It was incredibly bad to live under one roof with him. My mother did that till his end and drank herself into alcohol - induced dementia. My life is ok, good some days, I have a family of my own. \nI hope you managed to have a good life.", "SPAM is what he deserves. Served in a cold lump on a plate. Better yet...a can of tuna or spam upside his head would be better!", "I honestly was thinking about cheap dog/cat food, but I didn\u2019t want to be er\u2026 *mean*\n\n\n\n(Like those cans at Lidl, in Germany, at 15 cents per 500 gr.)", "Anyone else understand completely why the first wife divorced him?", "If they're small enough to need \"childcare\" they're way too small to even remotely enjoy first class. What a waste of money", "And not just that: he also thinks that it\u2019s \u2018his\u2019 money and \u2018his\u2019 decision on how it gets spent. The only positive is that OP has found about this now, lot easier to call off a wedding than to get a divorce.", "Yup, he\u2019s definitely saying the kids aren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d to be in HIS family. This guy can fuck all the way off, then some more. This kind of manipulation can cause wounds that last many years into the future. Ain\u2019t nobody messing with my kids like that.", "Bingo.  He's making that loud and clear with no chance for it to be misunderstood.", "At least they're not married, makes it easier.", "And if he's really that dumb to \"not know\" that's another issue too", "They're part of his family now. They ARE entitled.", "Her update shows she is leaving. It seems it was the classic \"I've invested too much to leave\" that was holding her back", "That's probably the biggest thing. If I left buying the tickets up to dh, there'd be no issues, unless there was an issue. If we can't be seated together what are the options and why? If we need to only board one area, if we can't get prechecked etc. That requires conversation because what the fuck. \n\nUnilateral decisions almost never work in a relationship.", "almost literally treating them like (relationship) baggage rather than family.", ">I think a redditor called it right--he put her in first class to watch his kids.  \n>  \n>the 80% child care you can bet means she's \"nanny\" for his kids and not just the main carer for her kids(as a matter of fact--I'd bet she's 99% responsible for her kids actual care)", "Her update!\n\nShe's outta there!", "She added an edit, fortunately she's already leaving and has family to stay with.", "Considering the youngest was crying because they had never flown without OP you're probably right. Plus her kids are 10 and 14 so 14 could have taken care of 10 I'm guessing is his line of thought.", "Oh I get that. Grams doesn't seem to think so though because they're not \"blood\".", "I\u2019ve got to say, having been a single parent since I was 6 months pregnant (my son is now 2) I couldn\u2019t imagine having someone else try to tell me how to parent my own child. I\u2019ve managed on my own this far. Some times additional opinions end up being more hassle than help in my experience!", "The kids will remember how they were treated forever. They will forgive money problems.", "I like how you put it.  There's no issue with one person deciding  -- unless an issue comes up that needs to be discussed!", "People like OP\u2019s husband wouldn\u2019t get the point of a move like this, unfortunately. And all the kids would just get hurt in the process.", "Best news ever in this situation.", "If what you said is true, and I believe that you are correct. This is just his way to get a slave with extra steps.", "I've begged my mom to divorce my dad my whole life. All she does is enable him to abuse me. She still hasn't and it just gets worse all the time.", "Totally! I feel for Op but her update sounds promising.", "dude hollywood needs writers like you. drop what you're doing & catch the first flight out (first class, of course)", "Husband would be like \"I bought the food!\"", "Thanks for the intro to Anish Kapoor! Just looked up his stuff. Cool!", "You should be proud that was an accomplishment,  not a fault,  imho.", "What an AH", "Damn I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that - sending love and hugs \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd0d", "There's a game ad that pops up on my phone regularly, and Every Single Time I glance at it and thing 'Why the hell do you have flying tampons in your ad?!?!? ... Oh that's right, they're meant to be sticks of dynamite'.  :-)", "I think since he buys the steak and she her contribution is the labor, the correct way to handle this is a beautifully seared steak for her and all the children, and just slapping it raw on a plate for him.", "I have, thankfully. I'm still processing some of the things that went on when I was growing up, but I also have a family. My family's everything to me, and some days I try to imagine having treated them the way I was treated, and I can't. Sometimes, it's that realization that keeps me sane; I'm breaking the cycle. I'm sure you can relate, even if only in how you treat your partner. I find it useful to cling to that when I mess up and find myself questioning if I'm anything like my own parents. \n\nI'm glad you've carved out something better than what you had. I understand that that's hard to do, especially with our tendency to choose abusive partners. I know I went through that, and I hope you were able to dodge that bullet on your way to an okay- to- good life. I hope for good things for any one of us who have ever had this experience.", "No, overdone steak for him is the way to go... Uncooked can be put in a pan, and made to perfection. If it is already overcooked, you can't save it..."]}
