Your fianc\u00e9 seems to missing the point: it's not that you expected your kids to be in 1st class, but that once everyone else was in 1st class, it was not okay to put them in economy.

How often does he exclude your children from group activities?  What else does he do to make them feel second class and why are you allowing this?", "So his mother told you that you're acting entitled because you wanted your children to have the same treatment as his children?  Yeah that's a hard no. You should have told her if flying 1st class makes you entitled then what are he and his children. The only reason she said that is because they're her grandchildren and your kids aren't. I believe the writings on the wall with this one.

She didn't care about what class she was in. Only that she has her kids with her.\n\nHe thought it was no big deal to separate her from her children. If anyone is the asshole.
