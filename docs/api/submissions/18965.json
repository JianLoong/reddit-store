I was told that usually it's free for up to 2 weeks but apparently my State is idiotic and doesn't follow the norm.", "Wait 30$ a day??", "That sucks. Depending on how long your house is out of commission, it may be worth finding an AirBnB or something else to get away from your SIL. She sounds like a nightmare.", "Have you checked out hipcamp. Might be able to work out a deal with a private campground owner", "Still, it'd be worth it to not put up with them. \n\nAlso, look into your house insurance, if you can claim back cost of accommodation while you're not able to live in your house, then getting a receipt from the National Park could be used to claim back and your stay would be comped. Or if you're allowed more, maybe you could upgrade to a hotel or bnb. Whereas I doubt your insurance would allow you to claim $30 per night paid to family.", "Yep - it's bonkers.", "NTA. If you have insurance, you can check the policy to see if they pay for you to stay elsewhere if your home is uninhabitable.", "NTA\n\nyou are actually paying money to a relative to sleep in a tent and use the facilites and she expects you to tolerate her demanding kid and cook for her using your own food.   \nTell her you will not pay her for any single day the kid invades your space uninvited specifically by you even for a minute - That should save you a few bucks", "Your attitude towards your niece makes you a bit of an AH it seems you have no kindness or compassion towards this \u201ckid\u201d", "ESH.\n\nYTA for treating your neglected niece this way.\nYour SIL is TA for charging you to camp on her lawn.\n\nI don't think she's pawning the kid off on you.  She's living life as usual, ignoring her poor kid, who is clearly lonely, bored (and hungry)\n\nI understand that your niece's behavior is poor.  You can either attempt to correct her or make other arrangements.\n\nWhat a cruddy life for her.", "NTA. Do you have any friends who would let you pitch a tent in their yard for say , $35? Cause that whole situation is ridiculous.", "NTA- $30 a day plus laying your own food, not even sleeping in the house? Fuck no, not the asshole. I feel bad for the girl but she is not your responsibility, your SIL is beyond entitled.", "NTA\n\n> I wake up and find this girl in our tent at 6am.\n\nWhat the fuck\n\nThat\u2019s WEIRD.\n\nAnd they are charging you 30 dollars a day *to sleep in a tent in their backyard*?\n\nWhat the ever loving fuck is going on here\n\nI\u2019m not suprised SIL is trying to paint you in a bad light, a reasonable person wouldn\u2019t be sending their 12yo kid to sleep in someone\u2019s tent to begin with.\n\nThe kid was in her own home with her parents; denying her YOUR meal and the meal you paid for and prepared for YOUR children is not \u201cdenying\u201d her food. The fridge and pantry shouldn\u2019t be locked up, and by now she should be able to prepare simple meals for herself.\n\nIf 12 is old enough to not be watched their old enough to not have their meals spoon fed to them.\n\nAnd your argument is that you won\u2019t pay your SIL money she expects you to feed and watch her kid. So it\u2019s her choice to take the money.\n\n(The coming into your tent to sleep should not even be on the table though, that\u2019s just so weird.)", "Does your insurance not cover temporary rental accommodation?", "I feel really sad for your SIL kid - your niece? I do not understand why you can't treat her with a little compassion... imagine yourself in her shoes . Adhd and her mother is already bad enough. She probably comes to your tent daily because she's lonely.", "Your SIL is either delusional or knows exactly what she's doing. You're sleeping outside for $900 a month, watching her kid all day for free, paying to feed her kid, AND paying to take her kid out when you go out. My guess is that she knows she was taking advantage of you, that's why she started spreading rumors that you \"denied a kid food because you're petty and ignorant.\" NTA obviously, but your SIL is a major asshole.\n\nDo you have homeowners or renters insurance? Usually they will help cover fees for you to stay somewhere else while your home is getting repaired. Also I saw that you said the daily rate for staying at a camp ground is $80, but could there be a cheaper weekly/monthly fee? Usually places like that or hotels will give discounts if you're planning an extended stay.", "Plus SIL stated the girl was 12 \"and didn't need a babysitter\"; so she also doesn't need OP to cook for her. ESPECIALLY when mom & dad are sitting RIGHT THERE!", "You missed the fact that OP is paying 30 dollars to stay in a tent in their backyard and she has to buy her own food? Are you insane? She offered the fkn SiL that she can take care of the girl and feed her but then she doesn\u2019t pay rent for the tent in the backyard. SiL said no. And also this sounds like the husband\u2019s sister, not her brother and his wife. No mention of her husband but it really doesn\u2019t matter. OP is NTA and she doesn\u2019t need to light herself on fire", "Seriously? Why are you paying campsite rates (fancy ones at that) to get treated like this OP? You might as well just go stay at a campsite.", "OP is paying 900-930 a month. Our local campground, can literally rent for 750 a month."]}
