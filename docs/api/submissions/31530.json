My boyfriend of only 9 months moved in with me because he had nowhere to live at the time, and I allowed it. I pay all mortgage payments, all utility bills, cable,\nInternet and water. We both buy groceries although he buys a bit more, and he usually buys my petrol as we often take my car when we are out together. I added him to my health insurance and gym membership because it is slightly more for a couple and turns out a good deal. \n\nHe is close to his parents and they come to town several times a year to stay with his brother. A few weeks ago he said they were coming up again for Christmas and want to spend half the time staying with us. His ex partner had made them feel uncomfortable so they said they would like to be able to stay with their son now he has a new partner.\n\nI am a shift worker and have no time off at Christmas. Last time his parents were here they asked him if he was off for Christmas but did not ask me, and did not ask me if it was ok to stay at my house.\n\nHis parents don\u2019t really talk to me- when we meet up with them they focus on talking to their son and say very little to me. We don\u2019t have any relationship. \n\nI find his parents disrespectful when they visit. A couple days ago they dropped in for a cup of tea at 8pm. Once here they announced they were hungry and wanted to eat with us. We don\u2019t really do big dinners, we just snack so there was no food prepared. They then said they would order pizzas for themselves to eat at our place. It was 8pm and I wasn\u2019t keen for them to stay late, so I suggested they go out to MacDonalds. \n\nHis parents discuss my financial situation with my partner behind my back. They are keen I don\u2019t use his inheritance/ savings towards the house and wanted to know if I was meeting my financial obligations without touching his money. \n\nFinally- when we were out to eat, they dropped my knife on the floor. They put it back in the table for me and then seemed supprised that I wanted a new one.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t want them in my home to stay over. I will tolerate visits, but not staying here.  I am working shifts over Christmas and I think their behaviour shows that they are not considerate people to my needs, as I\u2019m just a girlfriend. \nAITA for saying no?", "created_utc": 1700705248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181qacx/aita_for_refusing_my_partners_parents_to_stay/", "score": 4534, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is your house.  And his parents realize he is doing nothing to contribute towards it.   You say your boyfriend moved in because he had no where else to go, not because you are deeply in love and planning on spending your life together.  If he was sleeping on a friends couch because he had no place else to live, would his parents expect to stay at that friends house for a week?  When their son has a place of his own or is paying part of your mortgage and utilities for living with you, then he can extend an invitation to his parents to stay at \u201chis\u201d home.  But right now he doesn\u2019t have any place to invite them to stay.  Tell him absolutely not they are not welcome to stay at YOUR house. And start charging him rent.  He is freeloading.  And he learned it from his parents.", "NTA. Don't let them stay and he shouldn't either. Since he has an **inheritance/ savings** why is he living off you? Paying for his half of the food, or a bit more, and contributing to gas in the car being used to get him where he needs to go is no where near his fair share. And your providing a this man with health insurance and gym membership to boot? Why are you doing this? Normal parents would be concerned about their son meeting his financial obligations TO YOU, since you took him in when **he had nowhere to live** not the other way around. Red sea of flags here GF - you are being used!!!", "NTA\n\nHe isn't living with you. He's living *on* your dime. Please be very, very careful with someone not carrying their weight this early in the relationship.\n\nAnd, no, you absolutely do not have to host his parents. They aren't even all that nice to you.\n\nAnd again, please be careful in the long term.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Especially since you pay all the essential household bills. \n\nAs a responsible woman who bought my own house, it concerns me that your \u201cboyfriend of only 9 months moved in\u2026because he had nowhere to live at the time.\u201d He sounds irresponsible and it looks like he\u2019s taking advantage of you. And it seems like he learned to be inconsiderate from his parents who can\u2019t even be bothered to be civil to you. \n\nI say be totally honest with him about the many valid reasons you don\u2019t want his parents as houseguests. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d also talk to your BF about helping out with the bills. At the very least he should reimburse you for his share of the gym and health insurance.", "NTA but I am concerned. I'm seeing red flags between his lack of full participation and support--he should not be talking about you with his family behind your back. And he should be letting them know that it's inappropriate to just pop in at 8 pm, etc. That's bonkers. (or is it my age &/or introversion showing?) \n\nTake a good look at how his family are treating you. That's going to continue. And that's going to be his mode as well. Your home is YOUR sanctuary. Guard it well.", "NTA this whole situation is awful. You are fully supporting your boyfriend of 9 months to the point where he has knowledge of your finances and feels entitled to discuss it with his parents. You are absolutely being taken advantage of. He's sitting on an inheritance but doesn't pay for hardly anything. I don't want to be rude but you really need to have more self respect.", "Wait what?!? He pays for some groceries and petrol and that\u2019s it!!!  Honey, you don\u2019t have a boyfriend, you have a hobo sexual. \n\nWhat does he bring to your life? Other than bills?  \n\nYour house.  Your rules.  No parents.  There is a reason his last GF didn\u2019t like them either.  There is a reason she is an ex GF. Prolly because she got tired of supporting him.  \n\nNTA for not wanting his parents there. But you are an AH for allowing this man to take advantage of you.", "NTA - \n\nThe way of the day is to stay at an AIRBNB.  \n\nIt's not at all wrong of you to request this.  \n\nIt's actually probably better for the whole relationship entirely, it will also provide them with the space that would be beneficial for them to wind down in a space of their own.", "NTA. I notice that when they said they wanted to spend half their time with your partner, they asked them, not you, even though it is your house and he pays nothing to stay there. Ultimately, because your partner does not pay anything except for a few groceries and some gas, he is essentially a long-term guest, and guests shouldn't be having house guests without the host's explicit permission. His parents need to understand this - because he pays no rent or bills, he has no stake there and, thus, has no position to be giving them permission to stay there. *He* needs to understand this as much as they do.\n\nAlso note something: where there is support, there is control. Right now you are supporting your partner to a significant degree. This means that you have a great deal of control in this relationship, so you get to make the rules. You are not \"just a girlfriend\" - you are the boss.\n\nSo, in short, you have every right to veto your partner's parent staying at your house.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour house, your rules. You do share a household, so your partner should get some say. It would not be out of order for you to assert control. But inviting guests over without consulting you is rude. Having them invite themselves is flat out nonsense.  \n\n\nJust put your foot down and let the reactions give you an idea what married life might look like. Does your partner back you up? Do they listen to your objections? Do they come up with counter-arguments, or do they just apply pressure? I s the reaction from the parents an escalation?  \n\n\nEveryone reading this knows the answer to all of this already. Do you?", "NTA. They are treating your house like a free hotel and eyeing you up with a view to taking you for all you have got. I would send bf on his merry way to spend Christmas with his parents, since you will not be celebrating Christmas at your house this year because of your shift work.", "No offence, but what were you thinking! 9 months in, and he moves in with you. You pay for his insurance and the house. At least have a tenants agreement and make him pay rent. At the very least, he should be paying 50% utilities.\nJust be wary of this OP. Someone who is used to having another subsidize their lifestyle can turn to be very entitled. His own family are happy for you to pay for their sons way but don't want him spending a dime on you. Be very, very careful.\nHonestly, I don't see this ending well.  Always protect yourself and ensure you are not in de facto relationship state.", "NTA for not wanting visitors when you are working shifts. But I need to ask why you are supporting a man who clearly has money to live on his own. He\u2019s taking advantage of you and you are allowing it. He should be paying you rent and splitting utilities since he as an inheritance.", "NTA. Why don't they stay with his brother and invite your BG for Christmas? They definitely don't care about you and your relationship, they are not even thankful you allow him to live in your place for free. So I'd rather not let them stay either.", "NTA\n\n>His ex partner had made them feel uncomfortable so they said they would like to be able to stay with their son now he has a new partner\n\nwho they don't talk to and build a relationship with, and now feels uncomfortable with them. \n\nI would LOVE to hear the ex's viewpoint!", "Before you know it January will come and this issue will be a memory, but your relationship will still suck big time.  NTA but reevaluate your priorities.", "NTA.  Have him go stay with his brother, while you're at it, though.  Why did he have no place to live if he has an inheritance and savings?  He's a mooch.", "sorry to say it but this man does not love you. Men who love you want to impress you, they want to take care of you, they want to put their best foot forward, and be a true partner and support for you. This guy is a user and an opportunist who moved in on a vulnerable woman fresh out of a crap relationship. He is not even TRYING to meet you halfway here. Don't make excuses for him. It's not worth it.  Even if it's because he's a dumbass and it genuinely hasn't OCCURRED to him to pay his own way fairly in the relationship, that still makes him a total DUMBASS on his BEST DAY.  Boot him out. Get cats.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think his last partner actually made THEM uncomfortable. They probably treated her like a piece of furniture like they are you and she didn\u2019t tolerate it. Why\u2019d you let this guy in?", "NTA But as a lawyer I fee compelled to URGE you to do yourself a favour and get a cohabitation agreement in place as soon as possible that protects your interest in the house and make it clear that: (a) neither your boyfriends\u2019 residence; (b) the existence of any common law relationship the two of you; (c) nor not any contribution he makes toward the household, entitle him to an interest in your property, now or ever. I\u2019m concerned that in the event of a relationship breakdown he might be able to claim some interest in the house that you have worked your butt off for. \n\nInfo: does he work? Is he able to support himself? Why is he not contributing more?", "Why your bf still staying?", "Good golly gee whillikers.  Reread what you wrote. \u201cHe said they were coming up again for Xmas and want to spend half the time staying with us\u201d.  Us?   But they don\u2019t even talk to you in your own home.  There is no \u201cus\u201d.  \n \nLater you wrote \u201cHis ex partner\u2026made them feel uncomfortable\u2026they want to stay with their son now that he has a new partner\u201d.  A new partner: 1) they are disrespectful to, 2) have no relationship with, and 3) do not converse with.  You are not a B&B or 24 hour cafe for these people.  He\u2019s also allowing them to treat you like this.  \n\nYour entire first paragraph talks about how hard you work and what you pay.  What he does is in no way proportional to your effort.  Please get him out of your home.  You deserve to live in your home, that you paid for, without this bs.  \n\nGood luck!!", "NTA, but why are you with this guy? He sounds like a huge moocher. Why on Earth did you put him on your insurance?", "If I read this right, you let a homeless dude move in with you. You bought him health insurance AND a gym membership. In return, he gives you gas money when YOU drive him some where.\n\nI'm trying to think of a way to ask if he has a magic penis without sounding vulger.", "Why didn't you immediately call them all out on the BS? \"Of course he isn't using his inheritance/savings, he's been mooching off of me for 9 months!\" Make sure to say it loud enough that they feel the full embarrassment of what they were attempting to insinuate being tossed right back at them.\n\nIt's past time your *boy*friend moves out. He doesn't bring anything to the table except stress and grief. Do it now, otherwise you'll have unwanted guests in *your* home as soon as you leave for work.\n\nNTA but your bf and his family sure the hell are.", "You keep throwing around this term \u201cpartner\u201d, but I don\u2019t think you know what it means.", "So let me get this straight: it\u2019s fine for their son to live rent free in your house and make no financial contributions other than a bit of gas and some food. They want at the same time, to make sure that you are not using any of his money. You allowed him to move in when he didn\u2019t have a place to stay, even though you\u2019ve not even been seeing him for a year. So in their minds, it\u2019s fine for him to get a free ride as long as you don\u2019t touch any of his money.\n\nTo make matters worse, they barely speak to you, they dig into your private financial affairs, AND they want to stay at your house while you\u2019re off at work, not giving you rest after you return.  Entitled much?\n\nNTA, so far from it, it\u2019s on the other side of the universe", "I don't think you need a roommate agreement, you need an eviction notice. This guy is dodgy as hell. How long have you been friends? Longer than the length of time you've been divorced? \n\n\nI think you were an easy mark for him. He's taking advantage of you financially and going by how you describe his parents he learned how to at the feet of two master manipulators. \n\n\nIn just three short months he worked his way into your sanctuary, the one you worked so hard for, and it is no longer yours - although you pay fully for the pleasure of having him there? Are you so starved for company and affection that you're actually willing to pay for someone to stay in your home? Because that's what this amounts to. \n\n\nI feel like you are NTA but you sound incredibly naive and far too willing to give all of yourself away for nothing in return. You should live alone, maybe be alone for longer than three months.

It's your house.  I find it humorous that they are concerned about you touching the bf's inheritance, but he's leeching off of you.  Just say no.", "Of course his parents suck.. they raised a person who mooches off his partner. Why does he have all this money and not pay anything? You\u2019re basically his parent. \n\nDoes he work? What bills does he pay? \n\nNTA but I\u2019d reevaluate this relationship. This seems really sketchy. Especially his parents ignoring you when they are over? Do they just see you as their son\u2019s nanny?", "Uhhhh. He\u2019s living with you rent free because he has nowhere else to live\u2026but they\u2019re concerned about you using his money?\n\nWhat?\n\nDoes he even shut them down? \n\nNo and no.\n\nNTA", "My concern is you keep commenting that you left an abusive relationship and to me what your boyfriend is doing is a form of abuse. Maybe not physically but emotionally and financially. I worry is that this is the beginning. My recommendation is that you ask him to move out not sign a rooming agreement. I\u2019m concerned if you do sign an agreement, you might not have a way to enforce and things get worse.", "Do you plan to stay with your boyfriend long term? Do you see a future with him? \n\nIf so, you need to realize that his parents being in your life are a part of the deal. People\u2019s parents and relatives often visit during the holidays.

These folks seem like sharks and users.\nWho thinks that way with their kids partner?\nSo disrespectful and yucky.\nThey are TA. BF doesn't seem like a catch either, rather childish and looking out for #1 and it's not you!", "NTA. Be careful! with free accommodations don\u2019t be surprised if the whole family moves in. Set boundaries now. He should be paying rent with a signed lease agreement if not it won\u2019t be too much longer before this becomes considered a matrimonial home.", "NTA. Don\u2019t allow it.

However, please ask yourself the bigger question: is this guy the real deal? Just because he was kind to you during a bad time if your life does NOT mean you owe him anything. The speed at which he\u2019s inserted himself into your home is a red flag, and the fact he pays barely nothing is a loud alarm bell. \n\nPlease be honest with yourself and ask yourself the tough questions.

Obviously it's important that only YOU pay the mortgage, because otherwise he could claim part of your house etc. But there's no reason he shouldn't be paying half of all the utility bills and cable, Internet and water etc. He's using all of those things. \nHe could however pay something as rent. Although you may prefer he doesn't as that could class him as a Tennant with Tennant rights. \nBut I would also consider getting something drawn up that states he has no claim on the house and it is 100% bought and paid for by you etc. \n\nBut he should definitely be contributing half towards all the utilities, entertainment, Internet, water etc. Otherwise he's living rent free with you. He's only buying his own food, sometimes paying a bit extra towards the food. \n\nHis family are so concerned about you taking advantage of his money, I think you need to sit down and say something along the lines of \" I u derstand you've been talking to your parents about my finances and who pays what in the house because they are concerned im taking advantage of your money towards the house. So it got me thinking, and I realise it's actually you taking advantage of me and my house and my finances. \nYou are effectively living here rent free, with everything paid for by me, and all you contribute towards is food for yourself. I think it needs to be fair, and so I'd like you to start paying for half the utilities,  entertainment, and water, and Internet etc. The fact they were so concerned with me taking advantage of you, it's made me realise how one sided things actually are, and if you were living elsewhere, you'd have to pay all of those things PLUS rent. So you'll still be getting a good deal as you won't be paying rent, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be contributing for your share and usage for everything else. I've tallied up all the bills, and here's a breakdown of each item and your share of the bills. You can start paying as of the 1st of December. \n\nIf he doesn't, I'd be thinking hard about whether this guy actually respects you and values you. He moved in quite conveniently early on in your relationship because he had NOWHERE ELSE TO LIVE. Couldnt he have lived with his parents? Or why couldn't he use his inheritance to rent a flat??? \nSounds like he saw it as quite convenient you bought a house and is taking advantage of you and your generosity.\n\n I was taken advantage of / financially abused by my ex boyfriend and I felt so stupid for believing all the lies and manipulation for so long. As soon as I caught him out in a big lie, costing me a big chunk of money, (on top of everything else he'd borrowed off me) I ended things. He'd always said he'd pay me back the money he'd asked to borrow, each time for different reasons, but always promises to pay it back. Occasionally he'd pay me some money one week but then borrow double the next. But when I realise what he'd been doing, lying and manipulating me to lend him money, I ended it. When he realised I wasn't going to forgive him, and he wouldn't be able to use me like an ATM anymore, he soon changed his tune. Refused to meet me in person to appologise and talk about it all, and then became rude when asking him to transfer some money when he got paid (which he'd originally agreed to pay me some money each month till he sorted out getting a loan to pay it all back to me -, that was before he realised I was ended things. Once I ended it, he changed his tune). Refused to meet me face to face to appologise as he felt there was no point. And then got annoyed when I asked him to pay me something when he got paid. \nIn the end, coz of his behaviour and rudeness, the fact I'd done nothing wrong but support him, try to help him, trust him, and love him, I couldn't believe the nerve he had to be rude at me like that. But it just proved he was only interested in the money. Once that stopped, his behaviour changed. So I wasn't going to waste time messaging every month having to try and get my money back, so I took him to court. All the text messages of his lies and manipulation, and proof of bank transfers, and his texts always saying he'd pay me back, I won the claim and he was forced to pay it back to me. \n\nSo don't let this guy take advantage of you and your home. If he's living there, rent free, the least he should do is pay half of all other utilities and bills.\n\nAlso, if his parents can't treat you with kindness and respect, or even ask you if they could come stay in YOUR home, they don't deserve to be allowed to stay.", "NTA.

What a coincidence.", "Once upon a time, while still in university, I had my first gig in the field I am working in and studied for. Small time company, mostly students, except for one boss and a few full time workers.\n\nThe boss was extremely toxic. I mean, extremely. He had exactly one top-tier full time employee, never gave him compliments, always criticized at the first hint of trouble and even resorted to profanity and name calling. Mind you, this was his attitude towards the guy, who glued his entire company together.\n\nThing is, at the time I did not know what kind of boss he is, but learned it down the line: It is the kind of person, that makes you think, \"if only I do a little better, he will offer respect and it will be even more rewarding, since he is that strict\". Here's the kicker - respect never comes with such a person. If you go above and beyond, all they see is, \"I was right all along\", they assume _above and beyond_  is the standard and expect even more. There is never a \"thank you\", be it verbally or by providing more money or benefits. Toxicity never stops. They keep this hope to \"only become a little better, and then your efforts will be rewarded\" dangling forever in front of you - this moment never comes.\n\nThis is how I see these parents at the moment. You think, \"if only I let them have their way a bit more, they see what a good potential daughter in law I am, and the relationship will become so much better\". But if you offer such people the finger, they don't say \"thank you\", instead they take the hand. Even letting you know from the start, they did not like the previous girlfriend can be a manipulation tactic.\n\nFor what it's worth - in the end, we all quit that toxic company, I told you about. At the time, I had been miserable for months and all my friends and my partner told me to quit. However I was paying for university, rent, utilities, food, everything all by myself and this was my source of income, so jumping off the ship was a really hard thing to do. Initially I wanted to just power through and finish the studies, then leave. This changed, once I came to work and found a colleague crying in the bathroom. He worked for an entire night, to solve a problem and was about to finalize it in the morning, when the toxic boss came in, realized he stayed overnight, asked him, how far he got and once the colleague told him, \"almost finished\", he brushed it off with a, \"wow, so still not done\".\n\nThat evening we sat down with the student colleagues, all of whom were unhappy with that workplace. Over the next month, five people handed in their notice - there were only a total of eight people in the company. Never looked back.\n\nYou don't have to let a sh$tty situation run its course.

OP's boyfriend and his parents are the assholes here without question. We have enough information to know that this man has all the means to contribute equitably, potentially even more than OP since he's got this inheritance let alone potential actual income. And he is perfectly fine with his partner shouldering a shocking majority of his needs and wants, even when she's working overtime during the holidays because of financial matters from her divorce she is trying to overcome. Even if she wasn't busting her ass because of her divorce, he doesn't contribute simply because he hasn't been made to. It's not because he's hard off, or has no family or is estranged from his family. In fact, his horrible parents are fully aware OP is floating his entire life and they are reinforcing the importance of him taking advantage of her as a cash cow because it doesn't impede or touch his inheritance. \n\nI work in the trust and investment services industry, every penny he doesn't spend is most likely invested and the income it generates, IF LEFT MOSTLY UNDISTURBED FOR LIVING EXPENSES, is reinvested generating compound income. Every slice of time OP is covering the amount of expenses that his current investment income would be used for is a compounded future benefit to the tune of several times over (particularly where investing an inheritance can be done tax-advantageously so growth can avoid regular levels of taxation). \n\nThe real kicker here is that even if they split everything of expenses equally, that treatment by her boyfriend's family would be unequivocally disrespectful. His lack of respect to OP by not even recognizing how disrespectful it is makes him the asshole. And before excuses are made about him not realizing something because of how he was raised by these same people, I will say this: there are numerous people out there who grew up with shitty parents who grew up to identify how awful that behavior is and to stand up to our parents if not for ourselves then our loved ones. There's no doubt in my mind that this same boyfriend would lose his mind if he were in OP's position.

They treat our house like a holiday break, as we have a large garden that's not overlooked, and it's really quiet here.

It was 7pm and I said we need to make some quick food as ae haven't eaten all day, and the mother said \"We haven't, we thought you going to cook for us\". I flipped, just couldn't take it anymore. So they had fridge and whole kitchen stocked full of food for them, but they were waiting all day for us to come home to \"invite them\" for a dinner that we'd cook after long travels. If I didn't say anything they would just sit there and not say a word, they haven't communicated any of this to us. They didn't care we need to rest, unpack and that we are working next morning. \n\nThis is when I realised that with these parents you need to be clear and set expectactions early.

How come his parents, who clearly have money, can't stay at a hotel? This family will milk you dry and then turn on you. Cut them off before they have the chance.", "It\u2019s your house. It\u2019s your choice. They don\u2019t get to make the plans about your house. Put your foot down. \u2018Sorry that doesn\u2019t work for me\u2019.

That type is a mooch. You need to get rid of him and work on yourself, and not just for the holidays.", "You\u2019re only digging yourself further into the hole by being with this guy. He should be pulling his own weight. You\u2019re only nine months in to this relationship. You should never move the guy on unless you\u2019ve been dating at least a year. You can\u2019t really know somebody before then.", "Sis you are already repeating your previous mistake with your ex husband. Please do not start this new relationship with you doing the heavy lifting financially.", "Please make him leave and for gods sake break up with him now. Don't wait until December. Even if you will be working your ass off during the holidays, you will be glad to come home to a peaceful home that accomodates your needs, not his. If he isn't contributing in any way, he really doesn't have a say.", "You'll get ahead in your finances if you put that moocher BF out!  Is it your pattern to find guys that need your financial support? This might be something to explore in therapy.", "Let him know he should be back on his feet by now, so rent is $X and half the utilities is $Y and food will be $Z. \n\nLet the garbage take itself out.", "Charge boo rent! Or kick him out. Wild that he is living rent free", "Invest your money on yourself. \n\nGet a therapist. A session twice a month is probably cheaper than having another grown ass adult living off you. \n\nGive yourself time to heal and get back in the dating game when you know you can be comfortable being alone. Why? Because then you'll be able to see and judge people by their true character. NTA", "have you considered there was a reason the parents didn't get on with his last partner. and it wasn't the partners fault!", "Great idea tell him to do that", "Then you can go live there and only pay for some of the groceries, to get ahead of your finances.... Lets see how his parents feel about that", "If you don\u2019t want to break up. Have the lease start in January. Make it 6 months. Make it clear, he\u2019s not to invite people over without clearing it with you first. Make sure the amount isn\u2019t going to put him in any ownership but will still offset his cost of living there.  \n\nAlso seeing how his family is should give you some pretty good insight to your future together. You take on your partners family baggage too and they don\u2019t exactly seem too welcoming\u2026 even after you gave him a roof, health insurance, etc. \n\nI hope he\u2019s at least pulling his weight with cleaning and cooking.", "In America you can put your house in something we call a trust.

Look, you seem like a successful self sufficient woman.  While he may have been good as a friend he is not showing those same qualities as a BF. And you deserve a partner.  Not someone who is taking advantage of your prior friendship so he coast through life.  Did you BF/GF relationship start before or after he moved in?", "That\u2019s his problem, not yours", "He isn\u2019t paying rent even though he has money so he can afford an air b&b for their visit.", "Why is his comfort more important than your own?

Because this is a new relationship and you are agreeing disrespected by everyone,  including your BF. It won't get ant better.", "My parents in law are not the greatest. My MIL is rude, mean, nosey, etc. She is unpleasant to be around. The only way this has been bearable for my relationship is because my husband agrees with how I feel, and he thinks the same. MIL is on an info diet and we barely see her. He calls her out when she gets too much. I worry that there is no buffer for you because your partner doesn't see it as an issue. Your partner is being disrespectful by not even checking with you first, and he's not being empathic either. I just want you to know that you are deserve so much more than this. You are worth more than this, if you want it.", "Yeah I think if you put mine next to yours, yours are a bit more pushy and demanding. Mine are British, so they very polite and they wouldn't know how to demand anything in a rude way. That's easier to manage, but I need to tell my husband everything, when they need to arrive, when they should leave, what will we eat (they are picky and share 2 tastebuds between them, and one is vegetarian, plus nothing is ever as good as \"mum makes it\", so food options is a nightmare with them).\nMy strategy is now to give them a bad experience every time they arrive unanounced.

How do you feel when you are about to meet with a really good friend for coffee? How do you feel about doing activities related to your hobby / other things you are passionate about?\nThink about this for a bit. Really focus on the good vibes.\n\n2. How does this BF make you feel? Does he genuinely instill any kind of good feeling/ vibes? Or are you just sad/annoyed?\n\nIn my case, this exercise allowed me to notice what a good time really means to me (via the first set of questions and getting me to talk about whatever makes me feel good and alive). Then the second set of questions made me realize that the then current BF was only a source of anxiety and annoyance I was putting up with. It helped me make one of the best decisions in my life and I only wish I had ditched him sooner.\n\nIt may reveal to you that this is not the case at all, but in any case I hope this helps.", "NTA.  Why are you letting this leech live with you.  \"He had nowhere else to go\" isn't really an endearing quality .", "I loved reading most of these comments but I have to say, the next time they go out for dinner without you, change your locks first, then move his shit outside your door. None of them respect you and now you know why there was an issue with the ex.", "NTA. This sounds unhealthy,  all of it. The insanely fast cohabitation,  plus insurance and benefits,  plus all the behind your back drama. Sounds very unequal. May want to look up tenancy and common law for your area.  I don't want you to be stuck losing everything", "NTA.\n\nIt's your home, plain and simple.  He's staying there without paying rent, at your pleasure.  He does not get to invite his parents to stay without your approval, and you 100% have veto power here.\n\nJust say no, that's not happening, and it's not a discussion.  If he keeps pushing then he can go stay with his brother too.", "I signed in just to respond to this post. Your boyfriend and his parents are jealous of what you have and he doesn\u2019t mean you any good. If he\u2019s not paying rent then he can definitely help out with other bills besides food and gas money. He\u2019s saving all of his paycheck while you\u2019re finding his lifestyle. Have him use his own car when you guys go out. It\u2019s not just gas you\u2019re consuming it\u2019s also wear and tear in your vehicle that costs 10x more than gas money in the long run. \n\nI agree with the other commenters that he needs to go and you won\u2019t get your life in order until he moves out. If you allow him stay while you try and fix you, he\u2019s gonna drag down. Maybe he was a good friend but right now he\u2019s a sh*tty boyfriend and definitely not husband material. \n\nNTA but you would be one to yourself if you allow him to mooch of you. \n\nHis parents, just tell them point blank they are not invited. Also look out for them coming over anyways when you\u2019re not home. I bet my money on that happening anyways because when you want is not being respected.", "I would think again about inviting your bf f only 9 months to come live with you. I dot understand why people do this. You don't know this person & from hearing what his parents are like I'd be VERY concerned if I were you. Good luck when you ask him to leave. Idk where your from but a lot places would consider this a tenancy & you'd have to evict him to get him out. You sound like a very responsible hard working woman & I wish you luck with this loser", "NTA. Absolutely don't let them stay with you. I wouldn't allow it, either.", "I'm lost, so he had nowhere to live, started living at yours for free whilst you pay all the bills, and it turns out he has an inheritance he won't touch? NTA. I wouldn't just boot him out the place, I'd boot him out my life.", "NTA. Good news! It sounds like your bf has financial resources (since they are concerned about his \u201cmoney\u201d). So, maybe, he should move into his own place and host his rude-ass parents instead of mooching off you.", "NTA\n\nHe is massively mooching off you.  You are paying mortgage, insurance and utilities, and all he pays is some food?  You are paying for his insurance and gym membership!

He has savings and inheritance to pay for his own place yet he convinced you that he had no money for that?  You're living tight financially and not only is he able to contribute financially but he's okay not doing this and watch you struggle to make ends meet.

Six months ago it would have been joy, but now the honeymoon period is done and the harsh realities are setting in.", "Even if you knew that you were madly in love with him, I would not suggest adding him to the title. That's yours and you worked hard for it. There's no reason to just add another name to it. As to the equal rights with a rooming agreement, I'd suggest talking to an attorney in your area. Please take care and protect yourself!", "This is a terrible idea. He needs his own place and you have all ready given him too much time to find one. Don't you want to be in a healthy, balanced relationship with a complete and responsible human?", "You left one abusive relationship for another.   You\u2019re in an abusive relationship and putting your hard work and home at risk.  It\u2019s time to tell him he needs to move out.

Even if you get married. Just\u2026 why?", "Absolutely do not put anyone on the title and mortgage. Ever. Period.", "NTA. He's a moocher by character --- otherwise he would insist on contributing.  Throw the bum out and get a female roommate. Someone financially stable with a good work history. Maybe someone that works at your hospital? Good luck.", "It\u2019s important that you make him find another place to live.  Delaying it, could result in him establishing common law status.  Look up your state laws to understand the implications.  Having him on your health insurance, strengthens his case for partner recognition, and potential claims on half of your property.  Good luck", ">But if there is a rooming agreement does that give him equal rights to overnight guests staying a week?\n\nIt depends on how YOU, the OWNER, write the agreement for him, the TENANT.  You can specify no overnight guests if you want.\n\nHe's landed in a sweet deal ... free housing, gym and health coverage and he doesn't have to tough his savings.", "Not necessarily.

He prefers a direct conversation.", "My (m) partner doesn\u2019t pay for anything and I (f) was the homeowner and the one with a job at the start of our relationship. But you know what he does do?
