We also occasionally foster kids, mostly younger ones and short-term placements, but a few months ago my CPS agent approached me and kindly asked to take in an older troubled teen. I\u2019ll call him Ryan for privacy.\n\n\nRyan is 16, and he\u2019s a wonderful kid, despite his issues. He has a learning disability and he\u2019s no genius at academic stuff, but he\u2019s wonderful at picking up practical skills. He\u2019s not stupid by any means, just severely neglected. Ryan also has PTSD as he\u2019s the sole survivor of a horrible car accident. It\u2019s so bad he literally can\u2019t get into the car willingly and unrestrained, last time it was attempted, he broke the window trying to get out. He has a license, though, and had it for half a year now.\n\n\nSo, fast forward to yesterday. I wanted to go to the mall to buy the Christmas presents. Keep in mind that originally I asked my husband to do it a month ago and he still didn\u2019t buy anything. I couldn\u2019t leave the kids alone at home and I definitely couldn\u2019t force Ryan to babysit them. I also couldn\u2019t leave Ryan alone because he\u2019d feel excluded from a family activity and I wanted him to pick his own Christmas present.\n\n\nThe mall is quite a ride away from my house, and you need to get on a highway to get there. Ryan told me he\u2019s not getting in the car, and since I didn\u2019t want to argue with an already traumatised child, I handed him the keys and said \u201cokay, drive\u201d.\n\n\nRyan turned out to be a wonderful driver. I\u2019m a driving instructor myself, and I can tell if a person has a talent for driving or not. Ryan has the talent, he\u2019s basically a natural born driver, he feels the car, feels the road, he brakes and accelerates smoothly and he parks without parking assist even though he doesn\u2019t have much experience. He\u2019s on high alert, but he\u2019s not overly anxious. To be honest, I felt safer in the car with him than with my husband who\u2019s constantly on the phone when driving.\n\n\nWe got to the mall and back with absolutely zero issues. Like, absolutely zero, keep in mind that Ryan is an inexperienced driver and it was his first time driving a truck. So when my husband got home, I told him that I bought the presents and he asked me if I left Ryan with kids, I said no, I took him along. He asked how did I force Ryan in the car and I told him I gave him the keys. \n\n\nMy husband absolutely lost it. He said that it was incredibly irresponsible of me to let a kid drive the whole family on a highway. He started saying that I\u2019m a horrible mother and could\u2019ve killed us all, and even went as far as to drop the r-slur referring to Ryan. I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore as he basically insulted my son, foster or not it didn\u2019t matter at the moment, and I yelled at him, insulting his ability to drive which my husband is very self-conscious about.", "created_utc": 1701980596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d4m1p/aita_for_letting_a_kid_with_a_learning_disorder/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How does one get more experience?

So not only did your husband HORRIBLY DISPARAGE Ryan with that slur, he also disrespected you utterly by essentially saying you don't know your job. I would be LIVID. NTA, OP. And I think this just opened up some much deeper issues about your husband's feelings about Ryan AND you.", "NTA.\n\nI would have tested his driving somewhere less busy than a highway since he's inexperienced and has some traffic-related trauma; but you're a driving instructor so I have to assume that if his driving was shit, you wouldn't have let him get on the highway. That said, picking up on the fact that his fear of cars was partially about a lack of control was some truly great parenting and shows how much you care about Ryan.\n\nYour husband on the other hand is a huge asshole. The way he talks about Ryan is disgusting, and clearly shows that he doesn't consider him a member of the family. He also downplayed your expertise; you're a driving instructor and he knows he drives poorly - he should be respecting the fact that you know more about road safety than he does. Finally, it's truly ridiculous that he's calling you a bad mother considering you solved the car problem.", "NTA. Ryan has a licence, ergo he can drive to the satisfaction of the relevant authorities. I think you did a good thing by giving him this responsibility, and maybe in time it can help him overcome his trauma re being a passenger. If not, he can be a wonderful driver, so letting him have acess to a car would solve a lot of problems for him.", "NTA \n\nno matter who drives the truck, there's always gonna be a risk. yeah maybe you should have talked to your husband before letting ryan drive, but the fact that ryan has a drivers license und with you being a driving instructor, you definetly know, when someone knows how to drive. You mentionend, that you felt safer than driving with your husband, who is constantly on the phone while driving. Tbh that sounds more like an irresponsible driver than ryan does. And why should a learning dissability or a trauma indicate a bad driver?! I mean he ist traumatisied by that horrible car accident so I guess he is driving even more careful", "I now have to change my statement as I feel you are NTA. He has a license and is a great driver as you said. He didn\u2019t do it alone. You were there to help if anything happened. NTA", "NTA\n\nRyan passed his test, which means he's been driving for 6 months + (that was how long my husband took from barely understanding how to control the car to passing his test) even if a couple of hours a week.\n\nBesides, you're a driving instructor, even if you weren't in a car with the extra pedals you could still coach him or get him to stop if he was getting dangerous. So he's not only insulting your son, he's questioning your judgement in your area of expertise.", "NTA It would be one thing if Ryan didn't have his license and you knew nothing about his driving. But you knew 2 things- (1) you are a driving instructor and (2) he at least passed his license test.\n\nIf it was his 1st time getting behind the wheel, this would have been a horrible idea. But it wasn't.", "NTA, the lad has a licence to drive so can clearly do it, the traumas of his childhood may indeed make him a better driver, I know a number of people with autism who are also excellent drivers and can seem to see things like hazards far better than most other people.", "Nta, you're being incredible with Ryan, your husband seems.. oddly reactive?", "NTA. \n\nyour husband 100000% is. a learning disability doesn\u2019t preclude someone from being a normal human. source: i have adhd and autism and am a functional member of society. ryan passed the test, got a license, and likely has enough anxiety to make him hypervigalent on the road\n\ni\u2019m ngl, i would consider divorce if my husband behaved this way", "NTA my brother has a learning disability. He was in IEP for the duration of his school days and eventually just dropped out. But there are two things thar have always been second nature to him; engines and music. He's a naturally talented, self taught musician. Looking at an engine, he just knows how it works with no formal education. Having a learning disability does not mean you are incapable of other activities. And I'm sorry, but your husband sounds like a real jerk. Like, wow.", "NTA. Anyone who uses their phone while driving gets no say at all in other people's driving.", "ESH. You didn't know that Ryan would be a wonderful driver on the highway before you loaded up your other children in the car. Also, you don't really know what's going to set off his ptsd. Was he happy with this outing? There was no other day you could have gotten a baby sitter to complete your shopping?\nYour husband refuses to take responsibility here as well and used a slur.", "NTA, but it sounds like what your husband objected to was Ryan's youth rather than his learning disorder. A learning disorder doesn't prevent someone from learning to drive, depending on the disorder, of course. So it sounds like it was the best solution. My big problem with this was your husband using the \"R\" word. How can he be the foster father to a kid with a learning disability if this is how he talks?", "NTA. There's no shortage of fully cognitive people who suck at driving, so being fully mentally competent does not completely translate to driving ability.", "NTA, That poor kid. You found a way for him to get over his fear and your husband went ballistic?  I can see how he'd be taken aback but he's not hearing you about how well it went. You're a driving instructor and he's just dismissing your expertise?  If Ryan heard him drop the R word, it's really going to set him back.", "NTA. He probably felt safe because he was in control of the situation. He has a license, he passed the test.", "ESH \n\nWhy are you and your husband taking in foster kids that your husband uses the R-word for? It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s onboard with taking in foster kids. Did he say it in front of Ryan?\n\nYou should never have tested whether or not Ryan could handle driving a truck for the first time even, when he\u2019s got terrible PTSD, by putting your three small children in the car with him and hoping for the best. It\u2019s great that it worked out! But you took an unnecessary risk with small children and massively increased the pressure on Ryan, all for your own convenience.", "YTA\n\n> He said that it was incredibly irresponsible of me to let a kid drive the whole family on a highway.\n\n> it was his **first time driving a truck**\n\nYou got *lucky*.\n\n> I also couldn\u2019t leave Ryan alone because he\u2019d feel excluded from a family activity and I wanted him to pick his own Christmas present.\n\nWhile a nice sentiment, this shit isn't **more** important than *your family's safety*.", "Tbf you did make an irresponsible decision as children were in the car. Your husband is also awful for calling Ryan a R-Slur. Under no circumstances should that language be used. But I am going to have to say that you weren\u2019t the asshole but were in the wrong", "YTA.\n\nThis could have ended pretty badly. Now, it didn't so you might count that as victory, but  does your victory worth risking lives? What if there is a next time and whoops an accident happens? \n\nYour husband is right to be pissed, albeit he could have been nicer about it I am sure - but come on. One mistake and he would have heard about it from the hospital or from the local news. My unsolicited advice is to try to see it from his point, and be more careful - of yourself, and of others that could have been hurt in an accident.", "Both you and your husband are AH\n\nYour husband shouldn't use harsh words for children as they are minors and acting on the instructions given by their parent. \n\nYou are asshole because you did risked the safety of everyone. I'm not suggesting that Ryan shouldn't be trusted. I really think that encouraging him to drive on a safe and empty spot under supervision will help him a lot and i know that learning disabilities have a huge spectrum so in his case it could be irrelevant to his driving skills. But making him drive on high-speed roads with other children in the car was irresponsible of you. \n\nI appreciate your kindness towards Ryan, but you need to take things one small step at a time. Even if he is a driving prodigy, he is just a teen who has already suffered enough. As an adult its your duty to keep them safe.", "NTA. Ryan's PTSD is riding in a vehicle driven by others as he only trusts himself since someone else was driving in the accident where he was the sole survivor.  I get it that he has no trust in others' driving abilities.  Your hubby is a total ass.", "NTA the fact he has a license is the only thing that matters here!  He\u2019s passed the test and it\u2019s likely that the examiner was a little more strict than usual just because he has a disability.  He drove better than your hubby in your own words.", "NTA.  Your husband is unsafe.  I'm actually not surprised that Ryan was able to better cope with car travel being \"in control\" and that he was a great driver.\n\nI would have a very serious conversation with your partner.  That kind of gross slur-using lashing out is disgusting and I would call him out on it.  Just because he's mad at you does not mean he gets to attack an innocent child.  He can speak to you about his concerns.  Was he mad that you allowed him to drive when he's not on the insurance?  Was he taken aback this wasn't a decision made together?  I mean both of those are points of dicussion/concern, but that's what a big boy does, discuss rather than attack a third party who isn't the responsible one.", "your husband kinda sucks, nta", "You made a decision based on \u2018 need at the moment \u2018 rather than \u2018 let\u2019s just evaluate this whole situation \u2018 thinking .Thats rarely a good decision .\nYou are blessed that nothing bad happened .You did take a risk .Attacking your husband\u2019s driving as a \u2018 tit first tat \u2018 for what he said about Ryan is immature .\nSo far OP you are not looking too good except for the fact you are trying to rescue this poor child.Admit you did wrong , apologize to your husband and figure out what you are going to do the next time you are in the same situation .\nKindly \u2014YTA.", "My main question is do you have Ryan on your insurance? This is what would prompt any spouse to lose it if you don't. Husband's use of R word is uncalled for though you are putting your family in jeapordy. Financial responsibility of 4 injured kids plus you and any other involved party is a GIANT mistake if so. Holding judgment until further clarification...\n\nEdit: spelling", "(Ik my opinion doesn\u2019t matter that much)", "NTA. And congratulations on helping that boy with his PTSD. His way of being in a car is by being able to control it. You massively helped him! \nBut your husband. Now I'm a mum to 3 autistic kids. The R word.....nope. Just nope, never. If that word is in someone's head, it usually means they are thinking it. That is just unthinkable. My son wanted to end his life because of that word. It does real terms damage. I've lived it.
