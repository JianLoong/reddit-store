Her boyfriend didn't want to be involved in the whole process so it is safe to say she is a single mom. My parents have been helping her raise her kids as they always have. They always supported every decision she made including not going to college, dating who ever she wants and having kids.\n\nI'm quite busy with work, school and everything that comes with it. My mother called and asked me if I could watch the kids for a few hours on the weekend so they could take a breath. I said no because I was busy (I had a date planned. I've been dating my girlfriend (29F) for a few months but no one in the family knows or cares that I'm dating or that I'm into women). \n\nMy brother has work and his own family with 3 kids so he himself is busy as my mom said. I said I was sorry and I couldn't help out. My mother told me I was incredibly selfish to not care at all about my niece and nephew and only care about myself and ignore my family.\n\nI simply said it was ironic given the fact that I was constantly the one being ignored in the family and I hung up the phone and didn't pick it up afterwards.

If you had plans prior to being asked, you shouldn't have to drop your plans. If you were free and offered your time, that's different. While it didn't work out to help THIS weekend, maybe offer another weekend where you can help.
