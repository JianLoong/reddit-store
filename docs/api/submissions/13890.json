I've been pretty self-sufficient and academically successful so they justify they have nothing to worry about when it comes to me.\n\nMy younger sister (Mary) had twins a few months ago. Her boyfriend didn't want to be involved in the whole process so it is safe to say she is a single mom. My parents have been helping her raise her kids as they always have. They always supported every decision she made including not going to college, dating who ever she wants and having kids.\n\nI'm quite busy with work, school and everything that comes with it. My mother called and asked me if I could watch the kids for a few hours on the weekend so they could take a breath. I said no because I was busy (I had a date planned. I've been dating my girlfriend (29F) for a few months but no one in the family knows or cares that I'm dating or that I'm into women). \n\nMy brother has work and his own family with 3 kids so he himself is busy as my mom said. I said I was sorry and I couldn't help out. My mother told me I was incredibly selfish to not care at all about my niece and nephew and only care about myself and ignore my family.\n\nI simply said it was ironic given the fact that I was constantly the one being ignored in the family and I hung up the phone and didn't pick it up afterwards.

That I understand and it would be nice of you to help her out every now and then.\n\nBut you have your own life, this was not your decision. You don\u2019t need to re-arrange your life because of her wanting to have a child.", "NTA\n\nYou are never under obligation to give your time or your energy to anyone unless you choose to.  If the children in question were children you chose to give birth to and raise that would be one thing, but they aren't so you don't owe their mother anything, and it isn't selfish to acknowledge that.", "NTA. Not your kids. If you want to offer your help, you can do so, but you have no obligation to do so since you're working and going to school and living away from everyone.", "NTA. Those children are not your responsibility. If they need a break either them or the mother can pay for a sitter for the weekend. Your parents chose to take care of these kids full time not you. Good luck.", "So many of these posts about looking after someone else's kids.\n- Someone else electing to have kids to a deadbeat isn't your problem. You can elect to help, but you're not obliged.\n- You had plans already. This wasn't a family emergency.\n\nNTA.", "You had plans. They can't expect you to drop everything to babysit. Call earlier if you want somebody to be free. \n\nWhy isn't your mom watching the kids if she's so fussed about it? Tell her to pound sand.\n\nNTA", "Oh, the tangled webs families weave! You, my friend, are NTA (not the asshole) in this situation. It sounds like your family has a history of neglecting your needs and emotions. Now, they expect you to drop everything for them? No way!\n\nIt's essential to prioritize your own life, especially when you have work, school, and a blossoming relationship on your plate. It's not your responsibility to fill in the gaps for your family when they never bothered to do the same for you.\n\nYour mom calling you selfish is a bit of a pot-meet-kettle situation, considering their history of ignoring you. So keep living your life, enjoy that date, and don't feel guilty about setting boundaries with your family. You deserve to be happy too!", "NTA. \n\nConsidering you are being ignored, they have no clue what's going in your life, and when they *do* acknowledge you, it's for you to do something for them...?

You already had plans. Your sister chose to have kids & your parents opted to support that decision. That\u2019s great, but they had no reason to believe that you were up for pinch hitting childcare for TWINS.

Do not give an inch, or a mile will be taken.", "NTA\n\nIt is your time. Do what you want with it.", "NTA they are family but at the end of the day if they neglected you then it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d feel no obligation to help. It\u2019s your life and at the end of the day your sister chose to have those kids with someone who is disconnected from the relationship. My father in his own situation is the youngest of numerous siblings, yet it seems he(aside from one uncle) is paying for everyone else\u2019s expenses/mess ups. They even asked him for money right after he had a open heart surgery. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s rich either or has a fun/fulfilling career. Moral of the story, I feel like when it comes to family if you give them an inch they\u2019ll take a mile but that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve observed from my own familial interactions so perhaps I\u2019m wrong. Aside from that I\u2019m sorry you felt ignored in your childhood and hope you have/meet some good peeps that care about you.", "NTA\n\nSince they never have to worry about you, they should stop worrying you.", "Definitely NTA.

That your mother is choosing to do is on her, but if she is overwhelmed, she needs to take that up with *your sister*, not you. They are her children. \n\nAlso, where is the father of these children?

It leads to a lot of resentment that, parents especially, try and pretend they don\u2019t understand. Call your mom out fully and explain how their actions make you feel and how they only reach out when it\u2019s going to benefit your siblings. Don\u2019t let her off the hook and make her start working on your relationship now so if you have to go low contact later you know you did everything you could.", "NTA - you had legitimate plans and they can hire a babysitter. But, I'll just be honest - there's SO much bitterness embedded in this post. If you really hate them so much, why have contact with them? That's a rhetorical question meant for you to ask yourself, honestly. It sounds like there's tons of jealousy with the way your parents have treated your sibling versus you. I'd either pony up to reckon with that or consider if you even want them in your life.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom is really stressed and needs some help, so it was reasonable of her to ask you. However, it was also reasonable of you to already have plans. Maybe as a compromise, you could volunteer to help watch the kids on Sunday instead (if you are interested in having a relationship with them, at least, which is totally up to you -- in my experience, nieces and nephews are *way* better than siblings, but you also don't owe your siblings free childcare).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yeah no. \n\nYou should feel absolutely no guilt for this one. \n\nI mean come on, you can't really ignore a family that has neglected you and never give you the time of day or attention you needed. \n\nThey are not family to you.", "NTA.

They\u2019re his kids after all.", "Ehhh this sounds complicated. If your family was awful enough to not want to help out once, why are you even in contact with them? Definitely not your responsibility for someone else\u2019s choices (children), but sometimes we help and do favours we don\u2019t really want to do for people in our \u201cvillage\u201d.

Where is your sister in all of this? Why isn't she parenting her own children? Why do your parents need a breather when they are not the children's parents? The actual parent needs to step up here, not you or any other family member. If the grandparents need a breather, that's a sure sign that the parent(s) are the real assholes here.", "NTA.  However, you seem to know everything going on with your family so the fact that they ignore you seems a bit far stretched but I'm sure you feel like that and has happened at times because you're the middle child and gay.  I promise you that your parents love you though.  If no one knows or cares that you're dating someone, or dating a woman, it's because you're not telling them.  My guess is you've kept your sexuality a secret, and you haven't brought men around, so they don't ask anymore.  You could tell them.  \n\nIf you didn't have a date planned, would you have helped?  In my world, family comes first.  Have you helped out at all with the kids at all? It's not your responsibility, but you could offer it.", "NTA.

Unless something drastic happens, most people don't go totally NC with people. Lots of adults have little contact with families if they weren't close-knit growing up, sadly. And her mom called her this time, rather than the other way around.", "What makes op ah?", "Absolutely. But OP doesn\u2019t have to be ready at a drop of the hat to completely change all their plans because of it, however.", "So? A 20 year old decided to be a single mom to twins. Her mother decided to unequivocally support her instead of questioning that decision. That doesn't mean OP is under any obligation to cancel her plans on a whim.", "Lol cute. Is the sister deserving of her help?", "Yes, I do understand how this works.", "I was only pointing out why op mom probably ask for she actively helping with babies everyday.
