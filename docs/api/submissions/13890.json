My mother called and asked me if I could watch the kids for a few hours on the weekend so they could take a breath. I said no because I was busy (I had a date planned. I've been dating my girlfriend (29F) for a few months but no one in the family knows or cares that I'm dating or that I'm into women). \n\nMy brother has work and his own family with 3 kids so he himself is busy as my mom said. I said I was sorry and I couldn't help out. My mother told me I was incredibly selfish to not care at all about my niece and nephew and only care about myself and ignore my family.\n\nI simply said it was ironic given the fact that I was constantly the one being ignored in the family and I hung up the phone and didn't pick it up afterwards.

Mothers manipulating happens everywhere! \n\n\u2026\u2026so maybe I\u2019d go with neither assholes , but both sides stink like shit!", "NTA. But for your own self you might want to develop a relationship with your nieces/nephews. I love mine to death!! I really enjoy Auntie days and taking them for a day out. I have my own 3 kids as well.", "YTA \n\nNot because you said no-you have no obligation to help but because of the vindictive nature of your reasoning. You clearly have some things to work through  and I hope you find a way to get that chip off your shoulder.", "NTA\n\nYou're a grown ass woman who has moved out and moved on.  Do whatever you want.", "NTA \n\nYou had other plans already. As long as it is not an emergency you should not have to cancel your plans because of this.  If they need your support, they should ask earlier when you have not yet made other plans.", "NTA- Aside from already having plans, it sounds like they only call when they want something.", "NTA.  If they ask again, I would say, \u201cthe only time you have any interest in me is when you want something and even then, the only interest you have is taking up my personal time.  You supported her choices, so you can help her out.\u201d", "NTA.  I watched all of my nieces and nephews plenty of times, and sometimes it was just so their parents could have a break.  Never had any issues; if I said I had plans that night they were like, \"Okay, no problem.\"  Not once did I ever have to change my plans to look after them barring an emergency, which I did a couple of times.  Not once did either of my sisters or their signifcant other ever call me selfish because I said no, I have other plans.  Looks to me like they're getting what's been coming to them for a while.  No guilt.  Have fun spending your time with your girlfriend.", "NTA.  You said what needed to be said.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your problem. If you wanted to help out of the goodness of your heart, you can, but you're never obligated. And given that your family has never seen the need to return the favor, I would not feel obligated in the slightest.  \n\n\nPlus, it's the old story that if you give in and do it once, they'll expect you can do it every time they think they \"need a breath\". And that will be more and more often - because you don't have kids, what else could you possibly be doing? It's a tale as old as time. Say no, and stick to it.", "NTA. This all comes down to your parents being enabling AHs who was okay with their child becoming a bum", "NTA. Don't help out if you can't. End of. They put you on the back burner your whole life. Now they know what it means to be on the back burner in your life.\nWhy is it parents never seem to understand how deep the pain is when you grow up knowing you don't rate with your own family?", "NTA. If you're lucky, they'll take a hint. Block their numbers just in case. Have fun with your gf!", "NTA. It\u2019s your sisters kids and if she needs help she should have called and asked, not demanded. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have much of a relationship with her therefore no need to feel guilty. It\u2019s a tough situation but not your circus!", "NTA and if you say yes they will never stop harassing you for help and it will only get worse. Don't do shit for them", "Nta", "NTA they didn\u2019t care about you or your life until they wanted a babysitter. Once you do it once they\u2019ll continue to nag and manipulate you into doing it more. Sister needs to find help herself permanent help and learn how to manage instead of getting everyone involved.", "NTA. What they need to understand is that you have your own life, and you aren't under any obligation to put it in hold to make your sister's life easier. The fact that they've basically always ignored you, until your sister needed you to watch her kids, is all you really need to know they only care about you when they need you to do something for them.\n\nIt may be time to go NC.", "NTA. Even if they hadn't ignored you all this time, you're under no obligation to help your sister out.", "NTA\n\nContinue to assign the value to yourself, as it's abundantly clear that only by advocating for yourself will you be treated with the respect you deserve", "NTA.\n\nYour Parents are Enablers. You help out if you want to, but if you felt left out, then you should not jump in if they need you, thats my opinion.", "NTA. Those aren't your kids. You are not responsible for them. You do not owe them anything.", "NTA this sister is not even friendly with you and she seems to have family support. Why would you help them? Also, do you have experience looking after young kids? I\u2019d say that you might help as a favor if you were good friends with her, knew the kids, the kids like you + you happened to be free, but you\u2019re not. Your time is valuable too. They seem to only remember you when they need a babysitter. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s an emergency either, I wouldn\u2019t feel bad.", "NTA - just because your brother has reproduced, that doesn't mean that his committments and plans for the weekend are more important than yours.  They are respected by your parents and sister.  It could be aruged he was already minding children so it woudln't be an imposition to midn a few more\n\nEnjoy your life as a 23yo woman !", "NTA\n\nI empathise that taking care of twin babies is exhausting, but you were in the right to decline. You had plans. Providing childcare to your sister and mother is not your responsibility. If you had said yes, the requests would never stop.", "NTA. Why can't your sister take care of her own kids so your parents can get a break? If she has work, she can hire a sitter. Why are your parents watching the babies so much that they need a break? I get helping her out, but she needs to take care of her own babies.", "NTA\n\nSister made the choice to still have the children knowing she would be going it alone. \n\nConvenient of them to remember you exist when they need a babysitter.", "NTA.", "NTA Why can't your sister look after her own kids so that your parents can 'take a breath?'", "ou don\u2019t need to re-arrange your life because of her wanting to have a child.", "NTA. Not your responsibility especially after being ignored throughout your life", "NTA\n\nIf they just need a break sometime they could have tried to work with you and schedule something.", "NTA- your sister\u2019s kids are not your responsibility", "My thoughts too- it's a huge stretch to hear \"I'm busy for the time you want me\" and interpret it as \"my daughter doesn't care about her niece and nephew and is selfish.\"  That's a great way to ensure that the person you're asking will never do you a favor, ever. Not to mention, it's cruel to make statements like that- because now OP knows what her mom really thinks of her. \n\nOP is owed an apology before anyone asks for anything again. NTA.", "And she certainly doesn\u2019t need to rearrange her life to help the person that\u2019s already helping too much as it is.  That\u2019s on mom.  Mom can take a break anytime she wants by saying to daughter that she needs to take care of her own kids for the day.", "f they need a break either them or the mother can pay for a sitter for the weekend.", "I think should start helping her sister out. As op can tell if she does it won\u2019t be occasionally it will be expected and demanded. Sister being single needs to figure it out and not depend on op and her parents for free child care.\n\nSo op doesn\u2019t need to start volunteering. If you don\u2019t start watching them you can\u2019t get taken advantage off.", "For real. This sub would be so much better if it wasn\u2019t constantly fucking inundated with \u201ci don\u2019t want to watch children!\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s drama because of a wedding!\u201d", "Yes. Even if OP wasn't in school or working  they would still have no obligation over these kids.

I dread this too, but i takes a vilage to raise children", "Well, to be fair, it\u2019s not the sister who asked in this case. She can\u2019t really help that her parents treat the kids with an unhealthy/unfair dynamic.", "The sister was getting a break\u2026.by using her parents to watch the kids.
