My mother called and asked me if I could watch the kids for a few hours on the weekend so they could take a breath. I said no because I was busy (I had a date planned. I've been dating my girlfriend (29F) for a few months but no one in the family knows or cares that I'm dating or that I'm into women). \n\nMy brother has work and his own family with 3 kids so he himself is busy as my mom said. I said I was sorry and I couldn't help out. My mother told me I was incredibly selfish to not care at all about my niece and nephew and only care about myself and ignore my family.\n\nI simply said it was ironic given the fact that I was constantly the one being ignored in the family and I hung up the phone and didn't pick it up afterwards.
