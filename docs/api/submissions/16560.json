During our marriage, she had wild mood swings and would often become verbally abusive.

She then called my boss and coworkers, accusing me of various lies and trying to jeopardize my job. Thankfully, my boss and coworkers were understanding, and my job remained secure.\n\nDespite all this, I never wanted to keep Ben from his mother. We agreed on joint custody, and Ben would spend one week with me and the next with Emma. However, Emma has been increasingly manipulative, using Ben as a pawn to get back at me for imagined slights. She has consistently made false accusations against me to our friends, family, and even Ben's school, claiming that I'm an unfit father and that Ben is in danger with me.\n\nThe breaking point came last month when Emma called CPS and accused me of abusing Ben. This was a complete lie, and I have never laid a finger on my son. CPS conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing both me and Ben. They found no evidence of abuse and closed the case. This false accusation deeply affected me, and I worry about the emotional toll it might take on Ben in the long run.\n\nI'm now considering fighting for full custody of Ben, as I believe his mother's manipulative and unstable behavior is causing him harm. I have documented evidence of Emma's erratic behavior, including text messages and emails, and I believe that I can provide a more stable and loving environment for Ben. However, I worry that I might be the asshole for trying to remove his mother from his life, even if it's only temporarily until she gets the help she needs.\n\nSo, AITA for demanding full custody of my child after my manipulative and unstable ex-wife involved CPS and falsely accused me of abuse?", "created_utc": 1683405511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13a1ejh/aita_for_demanding_full_custody_of_my_child/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
