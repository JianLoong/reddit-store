We were married for 8 years, but our relationship took a turn for the worse, and we separated two years ago. I've always tried to maintain a civil relationship with Emma, but she has made it increasingly difficult. Now I'm considering fighting for full custody of Ben, and I need some perspective on whether or not I am the asshole here.\n\nEmma has always been unpredictable and, at times, downright crazy. During our marriage, she had wild mood swings and would often become verbally abusive. One particularly outrageous incident occurred when she accused me of cheating (which I never did) and proceeded to throw all of my clothes out of the window into the front yard. She then called my boss and coworkers, accusing me of various lies and trying to jeopardize my job. Thankfully, my boss and coworkers were understanding, and my job remained secure.\n\nDespite all this, I never wanted to keep Ben from his mother. We agreed on joint custody, and Ben would spend one week with me and the next with Emma. However, Emma has been increasingly manipulative, using Ben as a pawn to get back at me for imagined slights. She has consistently made false accusations against me to our friends, family, and even Ben's school, claiming that I'm an unfit father and that Ben is in danger with me.\n\nThe breaking point came last month when Emma called CPS and accused me of abusing Ben. This was a complete lie, and I have never laid a finger on my son. CPS conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing both me and Ben. They found no evidence of abuse and closed the case. This false accusation deeply affected me, and I worry about the emotional toll it might take on Ben in the long run.\n\nI'm now considering fighting for full custody of Ben, as I believe his mother's manipulative and unstable behavior is causing him harm. I have documented evidence of Emma's erratic behavior, including text messages and emails, and I believe that I can provide a more stable and loving environment for Ben. However, I worry that I might be the asshole for trying to remove his mother from his life, even if it's only temporarily until she gets the help she needs.\n\nSo, AITA for demanding full custody of my child after my manipulative and unstable ex-wife involved CPS and falsely accused me of abuse?", "created_utc": 1683405511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13a1ejh/aita_for_demanding_full_custody_of_my_child/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Only communicate with her through coparenting apps and get security cameras, because seriously, who knows what she\u2019ll cook up next. As others have said, get a lawyer, but also get your son into therapy. Having a parent with a mental illness can be deeply traumatizing. Having divorced parents who don\u2019t coparent amicably can also be traumatizing. If she\u2019s talking trash about you to your son, there\u2019s your third hit, it\u2019s detrimental to the kid\u2019s self esteem. Further, mental health conditions can be hereditary, so he\u2019s at risk for developing PTSD or other issues. You may also benefit from talking to someone, as this cannot be easy. \n\nBig NTA.

He is not wrong to try though.", "He legally cannot keep her child away from her. He'd be arrested if he did. He needs to follow proper procedure as hard as that may be, if he wants to succeed and protect his child in the long run.", "This is where my brain is. Why wait until now, if this behavior existed all along. I mean, totally do it now, it's never too late, but why didn't he seek primary or full custody when they split?", "I know that. I am saying he should have gone through this procedure earlier", "Considering i got downvoted most people here would probably do the same thing and then be surprised", "Because in a court, unless you have concrete proof of abuse towards the child along with police reports, the court is not going to give dad more than 50/50 custody.  It's a long drawn out hard expensive uphill battle to prove abuse like this, and there's been a lot of time dad's will be trying to get custody bc of this type of abuse and the judge will think dad is just being unreasonable and it will backfire.   This is not an easy thing to do.  That's part of the reason I assume to why your commentary was downvoted."]}
