Put his faith aside, his character does not come across as a very nice one and the fact your family are accommodating him, whilst kind, it's also encouraging him,.\n\nIn the Qur'an, it is specifically mentioned that any prey caught by hunting dogs may be eaten\u2014without any need for further purification.\"They consult you concerning what is lawful for them; say, Lawful for you are all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you. You train them according God's teachings. You may eat what they catch for you, and mention God's name thereupon. You shall observe God. God is most efficient in reckoning.\"\u2014Qur'an 5:4\n\nThere are also stories in Islamic tradition that tell of people who were forgiven their past sins through the mercy they showed towards a dog.The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that.\"\"The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, \"This dog is suffering from thirst as I did.\" So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him.'\"\u2014Bukhari Sharif\n\nIn another point of Islamic history, the Muslim army came across a female dog and her puppies while on a march. The Prophet posted a soldier near her with the orders that the mother and puppies must not be disturbed.\n\n**Based on these teachings, many people find that it is a matter of faith to be kind towards dogs, and they believe that dogs can even be beneficial in the lives of human beings. Service animals, such as guide dogs or epilepsy dogs, are important companions to Muslims with disabilities. Working animals, such as guard dogs, hunting or herding dogs are useful and hard-working animals who have earned their place at their owner's side**  \n\n\n**Edit :**  Wow, thank you for the award", "NTA.\n\nYou say he's \"said things that have made my siblings and myself feel uncomfortable and/or creeped out.\" You also say your sister has broken up with A multiple times \"due to A's controlling nature.\"\n\nThose seem like good reasons not to hang out with A, even before the problems with accommodating him at Christmas. \n\nI'm not even sure why A is dating a non-Muslim if he's such a strict observer of all the rules.", "NTA. There is a lot here, but I can't get past the irony of a halal Christmas. Next year's big Hallmark movie: Happy Halalidays!", "NTA. You don't go to someone's house and complain about their food or pets, especially when they've tried to be accommodating and put their pets up for you. If he's going to continue to complain, he needs to either find someone whose family makes perfect halal meals and doesn't have dogs, or date a Muslim woman. \n\nAnd he's your sister's boyfriend, not yours. You don't have to be around him if you don't want to.", "NTA. You set the rules of your house, guests should respect them. You do not have to put the dogs in another place when He visits, He should understand this, your house your rules. You do not go in his house to make the rules.

Perhaps before even bringing him over trying things out with the family like trying different foods or heck, even logistics like \u2018hey, what if the doggies can\u2019t go outside, what do we do?\u2019  Even on the flip side sitting her boyfriend down and talking at length about you guys to help the introduction process. Your sister not working hard on this front has produced a scenario where she thinks 1. Her family is xenophobic; 2. Her family doesn\u2019t like him. And now, that has resulted in you wanting to distance yourself from a situation that may or may not cause tension. Your position is totally understandable. Why your sister didn\u2019t foresee this and worked harder to avoid it is the real mystery. If she truly cares about him then she would have worked harder but it sounds like she may not even be too sure of the relationship.", "Do they have a sexual relationship? Because if they do - then he has no right to be demanding things, because he'd have broken a major tenet of the religion of no sex before marriage. So am just curious.\n\nWith regards to the dog thing he is taking too far,  its not his home - no one is forcing a dog in his home. He shouldnt go to a home with a dog if he doesnt want to be around a dog and especially not on Christmas day. He has a choice.  And he shouldnt be ruining the holy day of another family by making requests that will be detrimental to the well-being of Gods creatures.\n\nIssue around dogs is saliva,  if he gets it on his body or clothes he needs to wash it off before prayers.   Did he pray when he came over to your home - did he go to another room and perform prayers? Again curious about that, or if we waited till he went home. If he waited until he was home and did a couple of prayers together and not at the exact times - then all he had to do was shower or wash any areas that came into contact. Again its a one off - its not every day of his life and also he lives in the West where there are dogs outside when he goes for a walk, in cafes, in shops, in peoples homes.", "It's okay to not want to be around somebody.

There isn't only one version of Islam, just as there isn't only one version of Christianity.

If they touch a dog they must wash the area of contact seven times \u2014 the first time with dirt and the remaining six times with water.\" So if he's Shafi'i, then that's his sincerely held religiously belief, and it doesn't matter what any other denomination/jurisprudence believe. Insisting he's wrong would be like me, raised Southern Baptist, going up to a Pentecostal woman and telling her, \"Hey, it's actually okay if you wear short shorts instead of long skirts all the time! The Bible doesn't say you can't!\" It absolutely does not matter to her what *I* say the Bible says. She has her own religious beliefs.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, this isn't something you can out-debate him on.

You're not going to be beat him by proving he's a bad Muslim, or even a bad person. The only way you can \"beat\" someone who's mistreating someone you love is to make sure the person you loves knows they're loved, that they'll always have a place in your life, and that you're not going to judge them for any choices they make regarding their relationship, either continuing it or ending it.", "NOPE.

Would a Catholic man insist on knowing about the parents birth control or whether all the kids have been christened?\n\nWhen people use their own religious beliefs as a stick to beat others, it\u2019s the person that\u2019s the problem, not the religion.\n\nThis is simply a very unpleasant and controlling man who is attempting to isolate the F20 sister from her family by creating these issues and then telling her HE is being victimized.\n\nthe family should put a stop to all this nonsense.  Welcome him into your home, but \u201cyour house, your rules\u201d.", "NTA", "Coming from a Muslim family (different countries and different ways of practicing Islam in both of my parent\u2019s families) and born in a western country let me tell you this is complete bs.\n\nIt\u2019s not religiously forbidden to touch a dog, this is a lie. What is true is that generally Muslims prefer cats because it was the prophet\u2019s favorite animal while dogs are seen as dirtier (but this is more about the fact that later some diseases were spread by dogs but this was after the Qu\u2019ran was written). But many Muslims still own dogs especially people coming from families of shepherds. Overall there\u2019s still a general dislike for dogs nonetheless.\n\nAnyway he\u2019s lying. He doesn\u2019t have to be comfortable with dogs or might be scared of them but religion isn\u2019t the issue. Also you seem to have done whatever you could to accommodate him which is quite nice - i remember families of people I was dating serving pork by mistake and having to cook some eggs for myself or others doing it on purpose to show their disapproval of my background.\n\nThis guy is an asshole and were you supposed to commit animal mistreatment to accommodate him ? He seems self-centered and the kind of person who would want to antagonize your family to have more influence over your sister", "I'm betting that he is a narcissist... He's using the excuse of you & your family not  accommodating him to cause a divide. He's making things up, knowing those things will be a problem for your family to do. He has her seeing things the way he wants her to see them. This is how his isolation from you all begins. Very soon he'll begin to isolate her more and more, until she has only him. This isn't about religion, it's just a weapon he's using and he'll use whatever weapons he can... Just the small things I've read here and after reading many comments, I'm seeing complete narcissist... When she tells you that she won't see you if you don't want to see him, don't be surprised. But remind her that you're there when she needs you... She will need you...", "NTA.  You may want to point out that if \"no one likes him\" maybe it's because he's the bigot, not you. He expects you to shut your dogs, part of your family,  out to accomodate his religion ... in your  (and the dogs) home. If he behaves in a way that makes him unlikable,  she shouldn't expect him to be liked.", "I think it's really funny that a Muslim guy insists he have halal food at a CHRISTMAS dinner. Celebrating the birth of JESUS. He is at a Christian celebration. Muslims generally do not condone worshipping Jesus or celebrating Christian holidays. So why does he care about any of the other rules in this context? So hypocritical. I would try to be accomodating for someone coming to my Christmas dinner, but as an anthropologist and traveler I would never expect someone to change their religious customs on my behalf. He is entitled and rude.", "Define date...\n\nMany cultures and religions would presume that dating is the courtship/courting stage of developing a romantic relationship with the intention of marriage. \n\nDating does have casual connotations, but most people would consider the terms to be synonymous. \n\nAnd Courting/Dating happens all the time without becoming sexual before marriage. \n\nTo my understanding, courting in that sense is entirely acceptable and even expected in Islam - its generally a few national cultures which happen to be predominantly Islamic which expect an arranged marriage.", "Sure don't", "NTA. I would totally stop catering to this guy in any way. No guest should be calling the shots in your home.\n\nI would not put the dogs away and would not modify any meal.", "I wouldn't like him either.\n\nIts one thing to accomodate someones...requirements. Its another thing entirely for every single other person to need to change for them.\n\nFor instance Christmas dinner. Its one thing to cook a Halal dish for him, its another thing to make the entire meal Halal. \n\nPut another way, while its expected for you to make an effort to help him fit in and feel comfortable, it also should be expected for him to make an effort to fit in and make everyone else feel comfortable too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about religion, it\u2019s about patriarchy. He has chosen to be with a woman who comes from a western culture who isn\u2019t a Muslim. If he wants to be a part of your family or your family\u2019s activities he needs to learn how to adapt to your culture, not the other way around. As others have said, there is no specific prohibition to dogs in the Quran, it\u2019s his culture that has the issue and he is pushing his cultural beliefs on your family, not his religious beliefs. OP is right not wanting to be around someone who expects everyone to cater to his needs.", "NTA. \"A\" sounds like an isolating and controlling asshat", "You cooked halal for a Muslim on a Christian holiday.

If he makes you uncomfortable, for ANY reason - like the creepy controlling things he says, making you bend over backwards for his food preferences, kicking out your dogs, ect. - then you are under no obligation whatsoever to let this jerk into your home.   \n\n\nI hope she comes to her senses and realizes how controlling and toxic he's being towards her and everyone she cares about - he's probably trying to isolate her from her family, from the sounds of it - if he's totally unpleasant and makes everyone uncomfortable, they won't want him to come around, and if he can't come around, then she can't either, meaning she's separated from her family and friends and has only him to talk to/confide in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.
