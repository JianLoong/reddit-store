The \u201cwhy\u201d behind this gift must be interesting.\n\nIf the cups are made of a breakable material, I would start to use them exclusively. It would be a total shock to me how fragile the cups were and how many broke just by being put in the dishwasher or falling onto a table or being knocked off onto the carpet. Odd how a cup seems to break every month or so.", "INFO: are the cups specifically gifts for you, or for the both of you? Does he also think they\u2019re ugly? Also is there any option to tell them you have enough cups at this point?", "Couple of options. You can donate the cups anyway, or store them where they can not be seen and ruin the aesthetic.\n\nNTA either way, he\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nHave you considered accidentally breaking one every few months? \n\nMakes coffee and accidentally knocks it off the counter.\n\nDrops in sink while doing dishes.\n\nDrops after microwaving it because it was way too hot.\n\nOP, it must really be unfortunate to be as clumsy as you!\n\nKey is to do it irregularly and not too close together. You could even buy some cheap sacrificial mugs to also break once in awhile, so it\u2019s not always the ugly ones.", "NAH. If it\u2019s really important to him that you keep them, I think you should go ahead and keep them. Is it okay with him if you put them in a box somewhere or does he need them to be constantly in use?  Eventually there will not be enough room for all of them.", "NTA. If you both want to throw things out, you should. This seems like a non-issue. \n\nPerhaps you can put them in storage somewhere, as a compromise?", "Put them in a box to free up room in the cupboard, accidentally drop the box down the stairs.  Oopsie.", "Given that you've described the cups as ugly, it's a safe assumption that he's not gifting things that would be appealing to you. \n\nIt sounds like he's insecure about the idea that he gives bad gifts; that his standard of politeness is about never having to confront that his gifts are thoughtless. His extreme reaction to you wanting to throw away a pile of bad gifts suggests that he knows he's not a good gifter and feels guilty about it. \n\nYou're going to have to communicate your gift preferences to him at some point. Preferably at a time when you're not expecting a gift; thank him for being thoughtful, explain that you're really not into cups, and would prefer gifts in whatever type of category it is that appeals to you. \n\nNTA. A gift is **for** you. It's not a lifetime obligation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They were given as gifts, and presumably you conveyed your gratitude to the givers. Now you get to do whatever you want with the cups.", "NTA but do your in-laws visit? Would it be enough for everyone if you pulled those cups out of some corner of your kitchen to use when they come over?", "A gift is your to do with whatever you want to do with it once it is given to you. You can give it away or smash it if you want, it is yours. Also giving gifts should be giving the person what you think they might like, not what you want to give them. Theres a big difference in that. It just takes a bit of thought. His cup giving is the very least thought he can put in.  He is doing it for himself, because he certainly isn\u2019t putting any thought into what he thinks you would actually like to receive as a gift and only doing what he has made easiest for himself. \n\nPut them in a box and store them and ask him not to buy you any more cups. Tell him you will buy him a new tie or pair of socks or underwear every single gift from now on if he continues to inflict ugly grab any old cup off a shelf as his thoughtfulness moment in time towards buying you a gift, that isnt even actual thoughtfuness towards you. Its just a get-it-over-with perfunctory gift. No thanks.", "NTA; take them to the thrift shops a couple at a time. If he ever asks, they broke lol", "Leave on top of car and drive away.\nTake to work and \"lose\" it.\nPut in donation box with other household items oppsie what's that doing there", "Drop mug full of hot coffee in judgey husband's lap and let *him* be the one to break it.\n\nKidding, but man the temptation would be strong.", "Just break two of the tabs that hold the shelf up. \n\nThe shelf will topple and all the glasses will smash and look like an accident.", "The husband isn't the one giving the gift; the family is doing the gifting.", "i just reread and see that it is HIS FAMILY that is gifting you all these ugly cups. Hmm, thats a different spiel to give them. Just tell them .. please no more cups that you dont need another single cup, you have more than enough and actually do not want another one for the next 100 years. Thank them for the cups they have given in the past, but tell them you have a lifetime supply of them which you are going to be storing away the majority of the ones you already have\u2026 but please no more."]}
