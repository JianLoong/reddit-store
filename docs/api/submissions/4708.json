He's deaf and blind now so we have a baby gate at the top of the basement stairs (there's no door) so that he doesn't go down there since his legs can't really handle stairs anymore. My girlfriend (23f) and I have been dating for about 8 months and the other day we were rushing out of the house because we were running late to an event. My bedroom is in the basement so we were getting ready in there, and I went to go start the car and my gf was the last one up the stairs and out the door. She forgot to close the baby gate and when we got home my cat had fallen down the stairs and was crying on the basement floor.\n\nI took him to the vet and he will be ok, just needs a lot of rest, but they don't want to risk surgery or anything as he's so old. My gf has been distraught and I can tell she feels really bad. I know it was an accident but I still can't help being mad at her. I didn't think I needed to remind her to close the gate because she's been over my house plenty of times and she always closes it. The vet bill was almost $600 and although I can afford it, I kind of want to ask her to pay it. It would be a lot harder for her to afford because she's still a student but I feel like she caused the accident and should at least contribute something.

She was the last out and yes, she knows that forgetting to close the gate caused the cat to be harmed, and she feels terrible about it. But not everyone can always remember all the little details around other people's houses. She wasn't being malicious, not even neglectful, she simply forgot. Sadly your cat got hurt because of it, but she meant literally no harm.\n\nI think if you want her to contribute, you could ask her to help looking after the cat while he recovers, for example. Or do nice (but more affordable) things for him such as bringing him his favorite wet food or other treats he's allowed to have, etc.\n\nMaybe if she wasn't showing any sign of remorse I would think differently, but she clearly feels guilty so this isn't about you wanting to hold her accountable, it's about you wanting to punish her for an honest mistake.", "Yup, YTA.

It was an honest mistake, and it's your special needs, frail, elderly cat, so your responsibility to ensure its safety.", "YWBTA, because your reasons for wanting her to pay the bill are all wrong. it\u2019s not about the cat. it\u2019s about punishing her. you said yourself that you can afford the bill and she can\u2019t, so why make her pay it just to prove a point? she obviously feels terrible, and people make mistakes sometimes. she didn\u2019t hurt your cat on purpose, and there\u2019s no point in making her feel worse about it. \n\ni get that you\u2019re angry, i have cats too and i\u2019d be a mess if anything happened to them! but the solution here is not to take it out on your girlfriend. if her contributing something really means that much to you, then spilt the bill, or find some other way for her to make things right. you know she can\u2019t afford the entire bill, and making her pay its entirety just because you\u2019re upset isn\u2019t the move here.", "YTA.

This one\u2019s tough though because asking her to pay it or some portion of it would, in the abstract, be reasonable.  But it really DOES sound to me like you\u2019re asking out of anger.  You know she\u2019d struggle to pay it and you haven\u2019t really said anything about the COST bothering you, but rather that you\u2019re still mad at her for having done it.  Will having her pay all of some of it make you feel better? Why will it help resolve the situation?  Won\u2019t you still be resentful that she made the mistake in the first place, since that\u2019s where this seems to be coming from?  I think you\u2019d be better off figuring out why you\u2019re still so mad\u2014do you just need time to process (in which case just take some time to cool off), do you think she\u2019s generally irresponsible (in which case you should have a convo with her), or do you resent the cost (in which case you should ask her to pay)?", "Unfortunately I am going to say YWBTA.  If she is important to you, I don't think this is a great question to ask her, especially since you can afford it and she can't.  It was an accident which she clearly feels bad about.  I understand pets are family too and you are obviously quite attached, but your cat has already lived a long life and fortunately he is going to be ok.  You should just be content in knowing that and put the event behind you.", "Tricky one! I think asking her to pay 1/3 or 1/4 is fair but putting big financial stress on her with the full amount will inevitably cause resentment! \n\nAlso, check out pet insurance! I use CAA and it's $15/mo CAD for 80% coverage of accidents and illnesses.", "YWBTA . If you really want to keep a cat who is that sick, you must do something to protect him.\nInstead of a baby gate, place a door or a gate that has a spring and closes automatically.", "YWBTA.\n\nI get it that you're angry, but she feels bad too. It's sad you want to vindictively do this to her", "YTA. If you can afford to pay for YOUR cats vet bill then just friggen pay it.", "YTA - it's your cat that YOU are responsible for.

This is 100% on you.", "Ywbta.\n\nYour cat, your house, your responsibility I'm afraid.\n\nI have dogs, if the bedroom doors and the pantry cupboard door aren't closed then they'll get in and eat or destroy stuff. Therefore the last thing we do before we leave is walk through and make sure all the necessary doors are closed. We accept that if we forget this, the dogs might damage stuff or themselves. That's our responsibility. I wouldn't expect a guest in my house to remember to make sure.", "YTA: and honestly think your just trying to make another scenario based on another popular post here today.

Gates get left open. Doors get left open. If she did this with malicious intent, and didn't act sorry, I could understand blaming her, but that's not the case. You have an elderly, deaf, and blind cat. That poor kitty cat is an accident waiting to happen (how do you know where the cat is to not step on him / hurt him if he can't see or hear and has free reign on the house?).\n\nIMO YWBTA to ask for money towards the vet bill.", "YTA sorry.   Generally I am in favor of the person at fault paying for their mistakes.  But this is an exception IMO.  In this case what happened was an innocent accident.

IMO the real AH here is the vet - $600 just to examine your cat and tell you it is fine and needs to sleep?", "It's an accident, you can afford it, and its your pet, not hers.

It was an honest mistake. You both were rushing, and it\u2019s easy to forget things in such circumstances. But, it is still not her cat either way and in your house. You are responsible for making sure the house is suitable for your cats condition before leaving. Also, this is just a personal note you do not have to take any of the following statements. When I was 17 I still had my childhood dog who was 15 at the time. Now some pets are still relatively healthy whenever they are a very old age. But, in my case my dog was not doing very well anymore. He was fully blind in one eye and going steadily blind in the other (he had one brown and one blue eye, blue eye went first.) His hearing was impaired and so was his mobility. He struggled getting down the porch stairs to go to the bathroom. He also had arthritis. We knew his time was coming and he\u2019d only get worse and be in more pain if we just waited for him to pass naturally. So we had him put to rest so he wouldn\u2019t suffer, sadly. Now, I do not know your cat. You know your cat the best. And while it may be alright being blind and deaf? There is more than likely more problems occurring. I could be wrong and your cat could be in tiptop shape. But if there is? I know it is sometimes a really hard decision and you will try every path available to avoid the bad outcome. But, sometimes those hard decisions are in the best interest of your beloved animal. He is blind, deaf, and now has an injury that will probably still cause discomforting even after healed. He doesn\u2019t understand what happened and he won\u2019t understand why he\u2019s always in, at-least, slight pain. Just try to keep your furry friend\u2019s best interest in mind please.

He's deaf and blind now so we have a baby gate at the top of the basement stairs (there's no door) so that he doesn't go down there since his legs can't really handle stairs anymore. My girlfriend (23f) and I have been dating for about 8 months and the other day we were rushing out of the house because we were running late to an event. My bedroom is in the basement so we were getting ready in there, and I went to go start the car and my gf was the last one up the stairs and out the door. She forgot to close the baby gate and when we got home my cat had fallen down the stairs and was crying on the basement floor.\n\nI took him to the vet and he will be ok, just needs a lot of rest, but they don't want to risk surgery or anything as he's so old. My gf has been distraught and I can tell she feels really bad. I know it was an accident but I still can't help being mad at her. I didn't think I needed to remind her to close the gate because she's been over my house plenty of times and she always closes it. The vet bill was almost $600 and although I can afford it, I kind of want to ask her to pay it. It would be a lot harder for her to afford because she's still a student but I feel like she caused the accident and should at least contribute something.
