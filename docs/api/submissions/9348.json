The pregnancy was unplanned but we were happy to keep the baby as I make good money in a stable career as an engineer. Everything has been going wonderfully so far, besides of course the normal new parent/baby difficulties, until this week when my fianc\u00e9 told me it would be best if I got rid of my current car and bought a new SUV (she means NEW from the dealership, she doesn't believe in used cars for whatever reason). Her reasoning is that is unsafe to put a baby car seat in a 2 door car, despite the fact that the baby has only been in my car twice, riding in my fianc\u00e9s suv the vast majority of the time.\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t think it was unsafe but that I\u2019d do some research and that if it is that we could explore solutions. I looked into it that night, and according to every source I could find it seems that it is perfectly safe to have a car seat in the back seats of a 2 door car as long as it fits properly (which our car seats does). I told her that there was no need to worry as it should be perfectly safe. She interrupted and demanded that I should just grow up and make the right decision. She said that as a father my priority should be my son and not my \u201csports car\u201d, to which I responded that he is my priority but that these things don\u2019t conflict. She won\u2019t budge.\n\nI explained to her that a new base level SUV costs about double what I could sell my car for (her car was gifted to her by her parents and is worth about three times what mine is). I snapped and accused her of using our son as an excuse to force me to get rid of my car. I\u2019ll spare the worst details but safe to say she was the most angry I have ever seen her. I apologized for for accusing her but added that she was being irrational and had no logical basis for why I couldn\u2019t keep the car. This did not help and no she has gone to sleep without speaking to me for the past few hours. Am I the asshole?\n\nFor more context: I drive a 2012 BMW 335i that I bought when I was 22, a few months after landing my first engineering gig after college. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a sports car exactly, its sporty, but it\u2019s not particularly fast or small and is about as practical as a two door car can get. I ADORE this car, I do almost all of the maintenance myself along with some minor mods I did to make the car exactly how I wanted. The only wrenching I have done on this car since he was born was changing the oil which she threw a fit over because I was \u201cavoiding my parenting duties\u201d and just could not seem to understand that changing the oil is EXTREMELY CRUCIAL to keeping it running as reliably as possible.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has always hated my car. She would make comments about it being a \u201ctoy\u201d and complain about how small it is, also saying that it makes me look like a douchebag. She always got upset when I would take a few hours out of my weekend to install a new part or to fix or replace something.

This is about you having a hobby. If you would give up the car and find another hobby it would probably be the same. So maybe you should have the talk and find out what is on the base of it... Does she believe that parents should have no other \"hobbies\" than their kids? Or since she hated your car from the beginning, is she kind of jealous of any time and thoughts you don't spend on her (and now the kid)? Does she have an own hobby, and does she have enough space to dedicate time to it? I believe that having own interests is pretty important, because when one tries to get everything one needs from just one relationship it is just to much pressure on it.

But either way, whether you get another one or not, she needs to leave the car you already have alone. It is perfectly safe. Also watch it in case she's one of those people and try to sell it behind your back. You may be safe legally but you can still easily lose the car and never see it again despite taking her to court.

Having to manuever a 2 door isn't for everyone, but when your car is something you're passionate about, it's not a big deal. \n\nAlso, I expected far worse than a 335i. That's pretty sensible in my book. Then again, growing up, there was a joke in my family that 4 door cars were blasphemy. So I may be biased lol.", "my great grandmother developed PPP and remained psychotic till her death *fifty years* later. It's out there, but not *that* out there.", "If you don't know what you are talking about and have to base your judgement off of \"stereotypes\" and imagination then don't comment", "No it\u2019s the internet lol", "Why so ticked off?", "What"]}
