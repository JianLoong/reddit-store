Her fianc\u00e9 is a wonderful man and I\u2019m thrilled for her. My older daughter (S, F30) has been single for quite some time. Naturally, we always expected that my S would get married first, and I feel terrible for her that she\u2019s watching her sister live out her dream wedding without one of her own in sight. I tried to convince L to put off her wedding until after her sister was married, but both my girls thought that was ridiculous so I didn\u2019t push. \nL\u2019s dress appointment is coming up in a few weeks, and both S and myself were invited. I called S the other day to check on her and see if she would rather go on a fun mother-daughter day with me if it was too painful. S said that she was perfectly fine and that we should be there to support L, which is so kind of her but I feel as though she\u2019s just trying to put on a brave face, so I suggested that while we were there, she try on a few dresses so it could feel like her moment too. S said that it was a terrible idea and that the focus should be entirely on L, and that she genuinely doesn\u2019t care that L is getting married first. She even said that she enjoys being single and doesn\u2019t know if she ever plans to marry, which breaks my heart because I\u2019ve been dreaming about my oldest daughter\u2019s wedding my whole life. \nS has apparently told L about my suggestion, and L now wants to uninvite me from the appointment. I feel like L is being insensitive to her sister and my brother and SIL agree, but S is on her side, so AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m not trying to imply that a woman can\u2019t be happy on her own. I simply believe that given S\u2019s personality, she would really want a wedding for herself. She enjoys grandeur while L enjoys simpler pleasures. In my dreams of my daughter\u2019s wedding, I always envisioned a classic, grand wedding while L\u2019s wedding is shaping up to be more of a formal get-together. Not that theres anything wrong with that, it has L written all over it. Of course I support unmarried women. I also love both daughters equally, but I think since L is receiving so much attention, love, and support at this time, she can spare some of my attention for S.", "created_utc": 1679694891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12103jq/aita_for_trying_to_be_sympathetic_to_my_daughter/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank goodness your eldest daughter is a better person than you!!\n\n1.  You ask your youngest not to get married for an indefinite period of time until your eldest finds a boyfriend and decides to get married.\n2. You wanted to ditch your youngest daughters wedding dress shopping appointment (which by the way is supposed to be very important bonding experience for families) to have a mum/daughter day with your eldest.\n3. You suggested that your eldest hijack the appointment and try on some wedding dresses (Muriel\u2019s Wedding style).\n4. What next? Do you want your eldest to wear a wedding dress to the wedding?  Have her own special cake, dance and toast???\n\nAnd you seriously don\u2019t see what the problem is?  Where is your support for your youngest Who is actually getting married WITH your eldest blessing and support.\n\nYou are a poor excuse of a mother and I\u2019m glad she has uninvited you from the appointment and I imagine she is thinking of uninviting you to the wedding and going LC/NC.\n\nYTA!!

I called S the other day to check on her and see if she would rather go on a fun mother-daughter day with me if it was too painful.

She doesn't have to spare shit. Stop being a shitty mom and creating problems where there are none. S does not want to get married. And she wants the focus to be on L. As it should be. S has a good head on her shoulders whereas you lack one. Get over your stupid dreams because they're unimportant. Either be there in your entirety for L or get uninvited from the wedding as a whole.
