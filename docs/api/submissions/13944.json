Hopefully that gives her more time to think. Maybe I\u2019ll come back and update before I ship out in August?\n\nedit 2: some people are saying theres no way hes a doctor at 29 and after a Google search yeah I agree. ngl I just assumed he was bc med school and his age so thats my fault. turns out hes working part time and has been since high school + family is full of doctors (both parents are doctors, one brother is a plastic surgeon in Korea and the other is still in high school but wants to be a foot doctor)\n\nThrowaway acc because my sister knows my real one.\n\nI (17m) have an older sister (27, let\u2019s call her Mary). Parents had a rough divorce because of my dad cheating and she was always protecting me from the realities of it all. When I was bullied in middle school because of the divorce, hers was the shoulder that I cried on. When I got into high school, my mom moved me into Mary\u2019s apartment because it was closer to the school. She was my best friend for a really long time because I always felt like I didn\u2019t have any.\n\nShe found a boyfriend (let\u2019s call him Alex) when she was 25 and he was 27 and overall he\u2019s a really cool guy. He\u2019s a doctor, so he makes a good amount of money and occasionally spoils me and my sister with gifts, fancy meals, the works. He even offered to help me pay for college if I wanted to go, even though I said I wanted to join the military. Long story short, Alex recently told me about potentially proposing and asked for my blessing, which was super cool of him to do. When I asked Mary how she wouldve felt if he happened to propose, she didn\u2019t seem excited at all. If anything, she was like\n\u201cOh\u2026 that would be cool.\u201d\n\nI asked her if she didn\u2019t wanna get married yet and she said she did\u2026 just not to him. WHICH DIDNT MAKE SENSE TO ME. He\u2019s an attractive dude, about 5\u201910, works out 5 days a week, and has hazel eyes. He\u2019s a doctor with a stable job, and hasn\u2019t cheated or done anything sus as far as I know. He genuinely cares about her feelings, even has a routine for her period weeks. I\u2019d date him if I swung that way, honestly. That\u2019s when she told me she loves him as a person, but wouldn\u2019t want to marry him because HE IS ASIAN. Korean American. I asked Mary why she didn\u2019t break up with him if she wasn\u2019t interested to begin with and she said she wanted to be with him because he\u2019s a doctor, gives her expensive stuff, and asked her out first. Let me remind y\u2019all, it\u2019s been almost 3 years of them dating.\n\nI told her she was racist and only with him to leech off his doctor money and she got offended (the whole \u201cI\u2019m not racist I have ___ friends\u201d argument). I told Mary to either tell him the truth, or I would. Now, we\u2019re not speaking because she says her relationship is none of my business. I\u2019ve been hanging out with Alex more but I haven\u2019t told him about what me and Mary talked about. He asked me to go ring shopping in April so he can propose after I graduate in May because I\u2019d be shipping out for boot camp in August. WIBTA for telling him the truth?

He sounds like an amazing guy and you will save him a lot of money (and hopefully at least a little emotional pain) if you tell him before he buys the ring.", "NTA, but I have a suggestion. Mary supported you through thick and thin and you don't want to ruin your relationship with her. Tell her he's planning to propose and wants you to go with him to pick a ring, i.e., it's imminent and some hypothetical. Better to spoil his surprise and let her break it off before he gets to the proposal. If she doesn't, and plans to string him along through a long engagement, then tell him. Poor guy. I know you love Mary, but shame on her.", "Since you have your own friendship with him, I'd say NTA, especially because you directly warned your sister that you'd tell him.", "NTA!\nShe's the A for dating him just for the material perks.\nIt's FAR better for him to get hurt now, rather than getting married to someone who doesn't love him and have to have an unhappy marriage before a divorce down the road.\n\nBest of luck at boot camp, and please tell him if she doesn't \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA  \nHe deserves to be with someone who loves all of him, but especially the things he cannot change.", "NTA.\n\nBut I think the right thing to do would be to tell your sister he is planning to propose and to end it now vs. telling him. Let her end the relationship instead of the other way.\n\nWhen he figures out, he's going to leave and you're not going to be friends with him anymore. You will still be the brother to your sister. She's in the wrong 1000%, but when a good friend/family member is wrong you tell them that and help them make the right decision. Otherwise, she won't trust you enough to confide in you anymore and you'll sever that relationship. Bad long term outcome right there.", "NTA\n\nHoly shit your sister sounds like a major league asshole. By all means tell him the truth. Nobody deserves to be used and abused like that.

He does deserve to know, and you could also ask him to try coax the racism out of her and break up in such a way that she doesn't know you told him. He's a really good fella and you should be proud of your moral compass here because that's super hard to follow when your sister has done so much for you and you love her so much.\n\nI'm really sorry man, it really sucks when you discover something really shitty about someone you really love.", "NTA, Alex needs to know, but tread carefully. You are going to lose Alex in this no matter what, he won't want to stick around after your sister eventually breaks up with him. However you do have a family situation to manage. You would be better telling your sister that he's going to propose and let her deal with it; or make it clear to your sister (and any parents/close family) that you are going to tell Alex if she doesn't. Give your sister a clear time frame. Ideally get her feelings about Alex in writing too. Basically, get your house in order before you do anything, you don't want to put yourself in the middle of a family argument because your sister is an asshole.", "INFO - How is this real? Edit: reread it and he's 29. Which doesn't make this much more believable to me.\n\nHow exactly is this dude a doctor at 29 with money to spare? The average graduation age for med school is 28 in the US. Even if he entered med school straight out of undergrad at 22, he would have graduated med school maybe a year before they met and would potentially still be in residency for any high-paying specialty. \n\nHe would not yet be reaping the rewards of his specialty because unless he has family money he'd have school debt and his insurance premiums as a new doctor would take a good chunk of his income.", "You have to tell him.

The hurtful details only make it worse imo.", "NTA - please let him know your sister's a racist (I'm surprised you didn't know). If she marries Alex, I have no doubt she'll cheat on him too. Does he really deserve this?\n\nRacists often have non-white \"friends\" but don't really consider them equals. They're really tokens and as long as they \"know their place\" they can be friends.
