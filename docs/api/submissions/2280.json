I asked him where his mom went and he told me she left. I said what, and looked out the window. Sure enough, her car was gone.\n\nI call her and ask whether she knows her son was still there, she says that she left him there to run some more errands. I started cussing her out on the phone and she had the audacity to get mad at me after she left her child in my care without asking.\n\nI hung up the phone and I told her son that he had to get out. I open the door and tell him he can sit on the porch and wait for her. I also told him to knock if he got hungry. He went out without saying a word and sat down.\n\nHis mother didn\u2019t show back up for 2 hours. When she say him on the porch and asked what I did, she started banging on the door.

It also isn't like she left you with a toddler requiring your full attention.

It's a young bit, not a snake or an untrained animal. \n\nESH but the kid, who seems to have been polite and well behaved despite both adults acting like they just escaped from a zoo.", "Dang ESH. The mom 100% but your are 100% as well. The kid sounded polite and wasn\u2019t causing trouble, you couldn\u2019t just let him chill in your living room then end your friendship after cuz she\u2019s a horrible being. Poor kid he\u2019s only 12 and dealing with two adults here less mature than himself", "ESH. \nYour friend for obvious reasons. But you\u2026 what you did was unconscionable. Leaving a child outside of your home. Alone. How heartless are you? Shame on you. I can\u2019t even imagine how the poor child was feeling those two hours.", "ESH\n\nYou both essentially did something bad. He's 12, I'm sure he can somewhat take care of himself and I also doubt a 12 year old would be much of a pain if you plan him in front of the tv or let him watch YouTube videos on his phone. It is ridiculous to make him wait outside as it can be indeed dangerous. \n\nHowever your friend is also an asshole basically using you as a daycare, dropping off and expecting you to look after her son (even if he's just in your house and nothing else) is ridiculous and she should've asked. \n\nIn my honest opinion both of you are in the wrong.", "ESH I don't agree with people having kids and throwing them off on someone else, especially without permission but putting him out when you seemingly had no where to be is hard to ignore. He didn't seem to be an out of control kid, I would've let him stay in the house. \n\nCall the cops or let the kid stay there until his mom gets back then let her know she's no longer allowed on your property.", "ESH.  You should have told your friend that you would report her child as abandoned if she wasn't back in 5 mins.  You shouldn't have kicked the child out of the house and punished him for his mom's behavior.  Poor kid.  Seems like the only mature one in this entire situation.", "ESH. The mom for leaving her kid without so much as a word to you, but you for leaving him on the porch when he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Why wouldn\u2019t you just let him stay inside, if he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong? That\u2019s pretty crappy.", "ESH. This poor kid. His mom obviously has issues and is a questionable parent. She knew damn well you would say no to babysitting so she just ditched him.  But yes, you are the AH and I'm shocked you even have to ask if your behavior was wrong.\n\nSounds like you need a time out on the front porch.", "ESH, but the son.\n\nYou put a 12-year-old out on the porch because of his mother\u2019s actions? He\u2019s not a dog you can put outside until the owner returns.", "YTA You don't punish the kid for the mother's actions. You tell that woman to get her ass right back or you will call the police on her for abandonment. But to put the kid out on the porch for 2 hours is an ahole move. You and she are aholes. The kid deserves a whole ton of sympathy for having a mother like that.", "In regards to the title, YTA. This just wasn't the right way to go about the situation. If you were that opposed to looking after a 12 year old, you should have called the appropriate authorities and had them pick him up. Even had you not understood that was a viable option, kicking him to the curb like he has the plague is just terrible judgment. He's 12, pretty self sufficient at that age and I'm sure wouldn't have required a lot of effort on your part. Then when the mum returned you could have just dissolved the friendship there and then to avoid this happening again. Your reaction was nuclear, and unbecoming of a sensible adult.", "ESH except for the child. It makes sense if you cut ties with the friend afterwards, but punishing the child isn\u2019t the best way to draw boundaries with their parent. The best way is to deal with the parent. If the first response of you to noticing your friend abandoned her child to run errands was to then neglect the child yourself, YTA for that. You can call the police, child services, etc if you want to be extreme, but if the son hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, don\u2019t punish him. It\u2019s obviously not your job to parent the child or deal with him if he misbehaves, but the asshole thing to do as a person is not care about a child\u2019s welfare if you have the means to help.", "YTA\n\nShe shouldn't have abandoned her son with you, but kicking a minor out on to the street is just appalling behavior. If you don't want to keep an eye on him, call the police and have them collect him.", "ESH.\n\nShe most of all- that was a ridiculous dump and run.\n\nYou second. In what world do you throw a kid on the steps for two hours? Are you some sort of monster? Let him sit on the couch, call her and say if she's not back in half an hour you're calling the police. Then call the police.", "ESH, you sure you guys are actually friends.. strange behaviour from both sides tbh", "ESH. Your friend is obviously wrong for leaving the kid, but forcing this poor kid to sit outside all that time is also super fucked up.", "OP, you should\u2019ve phoned the police for child abandonment\u2014 leaving the kid outside for 2 hours in a strange place (to him) was very irresponsible. Your friend is also irresponsible, dumping her child on you was a dick move on her end. Gotta say ESH", "ESH. She's a crap friend/mother. But you have no decency. You could've let him sit inside and called the police instead. But no, you throw a kid outside to fend for himself. This kid did nothing wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "WTF??? YTA and ESH. It\u2019s not that child\u2019s fault; you could at least have had him inside, it\u2019s not like he was tearing up your house, he was just stuck in an unfortunate situation, which you made worse.

Your \u201cfriend\u201d is shitty to abandon her child and you are shitty for using the kid to \u201cpunish\u201d her. \nYou both suck", "YTA more than anything. I say this because while you and your friend BOTH left the child, at least she left him in a *house*. \nYou are terrible.", "You endangered a child in jeopardy. He probably felt bad enough being left behind by his mom with a relative stranger. Your actions were against the mother but you used a child to make a point. She was a complete asshole for doing what she did but, holy crow woman, you don't abandon a child. He could have wandered off anywhere. I can only imagine how sad he felt even if was used to his mother doing stupid things.

You do.", "ESH. Mom shouldn\u2019t have left the kid there but boy did you handle it fucking terribly.", "ESH\n\nshe did leave you with her child without even speaking a word about it first, but you did also leave a 12-year-old kid outside for two hours. he could have been easily taken by a random person. if you had a backyard that would have been a WAY better option than on your porch. and unless it was a fences deck he would've been SO easy to see hence more likely to get taken", "She doesn\u2019t know this kid.

It doesn't warrant the mother leaving the kid with someone who clearly wasn't ok with that, but considering the season, maybe she went shopping for Christmas gifts for the kid. That would explain why she couldn't take him with her, and also why it took so long. She should have asked if it was ok to let the kid sit in the couch for a while though, that's what makes her an AH, and OP is an AH for punishing the kid for his mom's actions, while it wouldn't have been an inconvenience in any way to let a 12yo sit on the couch for a few hours...", "This is a good point.

She didn't even tell me how long she was going to be when I called her to tell her to come back to get him.\" \n\nIt would serve her ass right. And I bet that 'errand' she had was a hook up.", "Why would she take this seriously if there's literally no consequences and she actually gets the free childcare she was after?\n\nLet us remember that she literally just dropped the kid at the door, not even inside. That's something OP can't even physically stop or prevent.", "Except the one that the OP punished was the kid who wasn\u2019t responsible for any of it. All she had to do was wait until the friend came back, told her that this was unacceptable and have nothing to do with her in the future.", "I agree with you. I actually think she should have called CPS. But it's not like I don't understand -why- she did it. Then again, I'm also a foster kid and I used to always be out of the home and away from it at all hours of the day and night, so 2 hours on a porch with someone that said I could knock if I was hungry wouldn't really be a problem for *me*. But that's an argument against helicopter parenting and how I'm pretty annoyed that parents can have CPS called on them for their kids outside in a fenced in yard while the parents are inside making dinner because their 10 year old is 'unsupervised'. \n\nMy generation drank from hoses. Now? That'd be abuse. 12 years old is hardy enough to sit outside and isn't abusive.
