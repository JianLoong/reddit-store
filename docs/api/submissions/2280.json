I told her sure and she showed up not much later. I didn\u2019t expect her to have her son with her when she came. I didn\u2019t really mind because we I wasn\u2019t trying to do anything crazy or say anything crazy. Her son is 12 btw.\n\nShe kind of had a hurried tone like she had to do something. She then said she had to run out really quickly but would be back. I didn\u2019t walk her and her son out immediately because I was looking at something. \n\nWhen I do finally go over to the door, I find her son still sitting in my house. I asked him where his mom went and he told me she left. I said what, and looked out the window. Sure enough, her car was gone.\n\nI call her and ask whether she knows her son was still there, she says that she left him there to run some more errands. I started cussing her out on the phone and she had the audacity to get mad at me after she left her child in my care without asking.\n\nI hung up the phone and I told her son that he had to get out. I open the door and tell him he can sit on the porch and wait for her. I also told him to knock if he got hungry. He went out without saying a word and sat down.\n\nHis mother didn\u2019t show back up for 2 hours. When she say him on the porch and asked what I did, she started banging on the door. When I opened it, she started yelling about how irresponsible I was and how I put him in danger.\n\nI told her to get off my property or I would call the police. She left soon after that.\n\nNow I got some mutual friends saying that I was in the wrong. I don\u2019t know the story she gave them but it can\u2019t be what really went down.

It also isn't like she left you with a toddler requiring your full attention. Once you realized he was left there, what did you think he would do that required him to sit outside for 2 hours rather than on a piece of your furniture? It's a young bit, not a snake or an untrained animal. \n\nESH but the kid, who seems to have been polite and well behaved despite both adults acting like they just escaped from a zoo.", "Dang ESH. The mom 100% but your are 100% as well. The kid sounded polite and wasn\u2019t causing trouble, you couldn\u2019t just let him chill in your living room then end your friendship after cuz she\u2019s a horrible being. Poor kid he\u2019s only 12 and dealing with two adults here less mature than himself", "ESH. \nYour friend for obvious reasons. But you\u2026 what you did was unconscionable. Leaving a child outside of your home. Alone. How heartless are you? Shame on you. I can\u2019t even imagine how the poor child was feeling those two hours.", "ESH\n\nYou both essentially did something bad. He's 12, I'm sure he can somewhat take care of himself and I also doubt a 12 year old would be much of a pain if you plan him in front of the tv or let him watch YouTube videos on his phone. It is ridiculous to make him wait outside as it can be indeed dangerous. \n\nHowever your friend is also an asshole basically using you as a daycare, dropping off and expecting you to look after her son (even if he's just in your house and nothing else) is ridiculous and she should've asked. \n\nIn my honest opinion both of you are in the wrong.", "ESH I don't agree with people having kids and throwing them off on someone else, especially without permission but putting him out when you seemingly had no where to be is hard to ignore. He didn't seem to be an out of control kid, I would've let him stay in the house. \n\nCall the cops or let the kid stay there until his mom gets back then let her know she's no longer allowed on your property.", "ESH.  You should have told your friend that you would report her child as abandoned if she wasn't back in 5 mins.  You shouldn't have kicked the child out of the house and punished him for his mom's behavior.  Poor kid.  Seems like the only mature one in this entire situation.", "ESH. The mom for leaving her kid without so much as a word to you, but you for leaving him on the porch when he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Why wouldn\u2019t you just let him stay inside, if he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong? That\u2019s pretty crappy.", "ESH. This poor kid. His mom obviously has issues and is a questionable parent. She knew damn well you would say no to babysitting so she just ditched him.  But yes, you are the AH and I'm shocked you even have to ask if your behavior was wrong.\n\nSounds like you need a time out on the front porch.", "ESH, but the son.\n\nYou put a 12-year-old out on the porch because of his mother\u2019s actions? He\u2019s not a dog you can put outside until the owner returns.", "YTA You don't punish the kid for the mother's actions. You tell that woman to get her ass right back or you will call the police on her for abandonment. But to put the kid out on the porch for 2 hours is an ahole move. You and she are aholes. The kid deserves a whole ton of sympathy for having a mother like that.", "In regards to the title, YTA. This just wasn't the right way to go about the situation. If you were that opposed to looking after a 12 year old, you should have called the appropriate authorities and had them pick him up. Even had you not understood that was a viable option, kicking him to the curb like he has the plague is just terrible judgment. He's 12, pretty self sufficient at that age and I'm sure wouldn't have required a lot of effort on your part. Then when the mum returned you could have just dissolved the friendship there and then to avoid this happening again. Your reaction was nuclear, and unbecoming of a sensible adult.", "ESH except for the child. It makes sense if you cut ties with the friend afterwards, but punishing the child isn\u2019t the best way to draw boundaries with their parent. The best way is to deal with the parent. If the first response of you to noticing your friend abandoned her child to run errands was to then neglect the child yourself, YTA for that. You can call the police, child services, etc if you want to be extreme, but if the son hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, don\u2019t punish him. It\u2019s obviously not your job to parent the child or deal with him if he misbehaves, but the asshole thing to do as a person is not care about a child\u2019s welfare if you have the means to help.", "YTA\n\nShe shouldn't have abandoned her son with you, but kicking a minor out on to the street is just appalling behavior. If you don't want to keep an eye on him, call the police and have them collect him.", "ESH.\n\nShe most of all- that was a ridiculous dump and run.\n\nYou second. In what world do you throw a kid on the steps for two hours? Are you some sort of monster? Let him sit on the couch, call her and say if she's not back in half an hour you're calling the police. Then call the police.", "ESH, you sure you guys are actually friends.. strange behaviour from both sides tbh", "ESH. Your friend is obviously wrong for leaving the kid, but forcing this poor kid to sit outside all that time is also super fucked up.", "OP, you should\u2019ve phoned the police for child abandonment\u2014 leaving the kid outside for 2 hours in a strange place (to him) was very irresponsible. Your friend is also irresponsible, dumping her child on you was a dick move on her end. Gotta say ESH", "ESH. She's a crap friend/mother. But you have no decency. You could've let him sit inside and called the police instead. But no, you throw a kid outside to fend for himself. This kid did nothing wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "WTF??? YTA and ESH. It\u2019s not that child\u2019s fault; you could at least have had him inside, it\u2019s not like he was tearing up your house, he was just stuck in an unfortunate situation, which you made worse. That\u2019s disgusting behaviour.", "ESH apparently except the 12 year old. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is shitty to abandon her child and you are shitty for using the kid to \u201cpunish\u201d her. \nYou both suck", "YTA more than anything. I say this because while you and your friend BOTH left the child, at least she left him in a *house*. \nYou are terrible.", "You endangered a child in jeopardy. He probably felt bad enough being left behind by his mom with a relative stranger. Your actions were against the mother but you used a child to make a point. She was a complete asshole for doing what she did but, holy crow woman, you don't abandon a child. He could have wandered off anywhere. I can only imagine how sad he felt even if was used to his mother doing stupid things. You always care for a child.", "ESH but you\u2019re more in the wrong than her. your actions were immature and dangerous.", "NTA\n\nYou should\u2019ve called the authorities after she confirmed that she left him though", "Kid is 12! You\u2019re an adult! Yes you\u2019re the asshole! And so is she. I feel bad for the kid. Not the two apparently grown people in this situation.", "ESH. obviously what she did is disgusting and borderline worthy of calling child protective services over.\nHowever, you are an adult and he is a child. You should have cared for him and then cut ties with your friend immediately upon returning the child.", "That poor child! \nYou\u2019re so absolutely horrible! \nShe is an AH but YTA too for treating him that way. That poor kid! OMG", "YTA. His mother was wrong for leaving the kid there but just kicking him out like that was a shitty thing to do. He's not to blame for his mother's actions. Yet instead of being a responsible adult and making sure that he was staying somewhere safe, you kicked him out to the porch like the kid was a dog.", "YTA. Don\u2019t kick a minor out on the street. Call CPS or the cops or something and then let him sit with you inside and keep him calm and comfortable. He\u2019s going through hell right now. Imagine your mom just dumping you at a random persons house, that sucks.", "Yta- her son shouldnt pay for her negligence. 2 wrongs dont make a right.", "ESH. 2 adults acting like major AHs. The poor kid did nothing wrong. Have some empathy next time.", "ESH. You endangered the kid as much if not worse than she did. Just call the cops if this ever happens again, but don't do what you did in this situation.", "She\u2019s the AH for leaving you to babysit without asking.\n\nYTA for making a child wait outside because his mother ditched him.\n\nYou should\u2019ve just let the kid stay inside and when she came to pick him up told her you were through with her.", "Nta, I would have called cps if a friend pulled that bullshit on me", "YTA you did something a lot more bad than she did", "Yeah, YTA for making a child that had been left at your house by his mother under no direction of his own sit outside for 2 hours instead of being an adult and keeping the issue between you and his mom. \n\nAnd yeah his mom sucks too but the question you ask is do you for kicking him out. You do.", "ESH. Mom shouldn\u2019t have left the kid there but boy did you handle it fucking terribly.", "ESH\n\nshe did leave you with her child without even speaking a word about it first, but you did also leave a 12-year-old kid outside for two hours. he could have been easily taken by a random person. if you had a backyard that would have been a WAY better option than on your porch. and unless it was a fences deck he would've been SO easy to see hence more likely to get taken", "She doesn\u2019t know this kid.

Leaving the kid on the porch really was an asshole thing to do.", "YTA but just for not calling CPS on her. This probably happens a lot. Who knows what other kind of people he might be left with.", "ESH. Her for obvious reasons, you for throwing him out.

That poor kid. Your friend is obviously batshit crazy.

You should both be ashamed.", "ESH,  except that poor boy. \nI feel very sorry for him and how he must feel being treated like that by 2 adults. \nMums shown no love,  you've shown no kindness.  I don't care how horrid mum was (she was)  you could of made things a little better but chose not too.", "Makes me wonder why the mother couldn't take a 12 year old to \"run errands\".  Unless he has some other serious issues, he's not like he's a toddler that gets into everything, has meltdowns, needs to be carried, etc.  Personally, I question what she was really doing for 2 hours.  Doesn't seem like he was hard to handle as he sat quietly on the porch.", "The only way this \"mother\" was going to get this is was for OP to do what she did. This kid was 12 not 4, many kids babysit at that age. It's not right to the child, but HIS mother should have thought of that!", "OP shouldn't have just let him chill because that's what the friend wants and will just encourage her to do it again. What OP should've done is call the friend immediately and tell her that the police were gonna be involved if she didn't come straight back.", "His mom left him outside that house. No way to just her bs move.", "No, actually the mom's actions were far worse. Dumping a kid on someone that you know doesn't want the kid is completely unacceptable.

At this point the friendship is fucked anyway.", "This is ESH she is a asshole the friend is a asshole the poor kid is innocent. Not his fault he got a shitty mom", "She is totally an asshole for putting the kid outside for two hours alone. It isn\u2019t his fault his mom did something shitty. Yet op was punishing him for it.", "I would bet she's up to something inappropriate,  for sure. If there was a legitimate need, she'd try to explain or ask for help. It's got to be something she didn't want her friends or her kid to know about,  even if the alternative is this kind of stuff.", "Pretty sure she's not actually running errands.", "Nope. The kid was inside. She kicked him out.", "nope. nobody said that the moms actions were okay, but actively choosing to put a kid danger when you have the opportunity not to is unconscionable. letting a kid sit in your house for a few hours harms no one. especially a 12 year old, probably would\u2019ve been on his phone the whole time.", "And? She had no responsibility towards the kid. Its on the mother.", "It's not about responsibility, it's about compassion."]}
