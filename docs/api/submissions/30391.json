For context, they live approximately 100 miles, 2.5-3.5 hours away, depending on the traffic. \n\nPrior to my daughter being born, my husband would go and visit on his own most of the time so that he got that all important one-on-one time with his children. I'd go maybe once a month.  I loved our time together, but knew it was important for him to have that time with them too and ultimately he's their Dad.\n\nEverything however changed when I gave birth to our daughter, when we would get begged to take her every visit.  At first, this was every week, but I explained to my husband that this was too much travel for a baby, and we decided to drop it down to every  2 weeks.  It sort of works, although she is evidently exhausted from travelling come Monday and it takes her a couple of days to recover.    At the moment, she has a free day on Monday/Tuesday, so it's not too much of an issue, but she's almost 4 and she starts school next year and I need to discuss this now rather than spring my views on my husband and stepkids last-minute, because when she starts school there is no way I think she'll cope with going fortnightly and then go into school getting home 8pm or later on a Sunday having travelled, but I know they'll all be devastated to see each other less.  In fairness, my stepkids are also getting to that age where they want to see their friends more, which unfortunately means we often go up and back in one day rather than having them overnight with family and means 7+ hours in the car in one day for her. \n\nSo, AITA to suggest this? How often would you suggest? Once a month seems so little, but also I really am trying to think about my littlest at this point as we have always prioritised the older ones and worked around them and their plans. \n\nThanks in advance.", "created_utc": 1699208143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ohx6z/aita_to_cut_down_contact_with_stepkids_when_dd/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just start with how things will be changing and how it takes a lot out of your daughter and how kindergarten alone can be very tiring for a child and you want to make sure she gets the best education opportunity.  \n\nOffer something up like more scheduled video calls.  And make sure you talk about how you want to make sure the siblings have a good relationship.", "What you think is best for the child.

Those are his children too, your daughter isn\u2019t the most important, she only is to you. You should\u2019ve thought about this before you had a child with a man that had children that loved 100 miles away.

Why can\u2019t they come to you guys for visits?", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t live so far from your step children. This is a horrible situation to put all of these kids in. Your daughter will resent not having a closer relationship with her siblings some day.", "You could say that travel is too hard on a kindergartner, and invite them to visit you instead", "NTA\n\nSchedules change as humans grow.", "NTA. You're being realistic here and it's not like they'll never see her again. I wish I could give you advice on how to talk about it, but my only thought is to be honest and bring focus to the fact your daughter can't do this all of the time bc of how much it takes out of her.", "It seems odd that kids 14 and 12 are so vested in seeing a 4 year old. They are begging to see her every week? Are there in-laws in the other town? Are grandma and grandpa doing the begging? You are right. Your daughter will not be able to keep this up, especially when she starts school.", "NTA - have you discussed trading the 1day every other week visits for something more substantial once every few months?

You seem to have set everything up so that this would eventually happen. Too far to drive, better to stay with grandpa cause they have their own rooms, being teenagers need dad less, friends more (or so OP hopes) and her kid is getting older so she can keep her busier so she can't see them as much but dad will have to stay home. Bla, bla, bla. She wants to rid her husband of his older kids without looking like she did. Married a man with kids that she wants to alienate while looking so innocent. Same old story.", "Just no. The notion is utterly absurd. There's no reason to be dragging a 4 year old hundreds of miles to meetups with a 12 YO and 14 YO. Most kids in this age range are not going to be begging to have meeting with a  4 YO anyway.  Who is pushing for this nonsense other than your husband?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That would be more effective bonding than trying to get a four year old to hold a conversation. I think your instincts are correct, to set your youngest up for success you should start to plan now for lessoning visits in the future. Maybe longer visits at school breaks rather than short visits more often would work better for both families?", "Have him go alone to see the kids every weekend as he already does and you only come with your child once a weekend with the explanation given. Boom done. NTA.\n\nThen make a deal that once every two months the children come for a weekend and bring their homework (based on the replies you\u2019ve given in the comments). Do you work? Would you be able to pick the kids up Friday evening or no?", "Look at my comment and the replies. OP refuses to move closer and actually made dad move away from his kids to be with her. She thinks this is a joke.", "They come to stay during the holidays.  Usually Feb half term, a week at Easter and a week the summer.  Then Christmas. X", "He made the decision to move. And she's never outwardly said why.  I moved there originally, but there's a long, long story as to why I moved back and now refuse to move again.", "You're surprised ? Dude lives 2 hours away from his kids and they never spend time at his house...", "Oh they discussed it. OP made dad move away from his kids for her.", "We absolutely did, but each child is different in their reactions to different circumstances and we didn't know how she'd react to travel.", "Cutting down on visits with their sister, not their dad, to be clear.  He still sees them weekly. I do not propose he sees them less. I'm not moving, ever. I made that clear when he decided to move to be with me.", "Unfortunately they're not exactly worldy kids, and they wouldn't travel by train which is the only way.  It's an easy journey with one change.  My husband, in theory, could go and get them and bring them back, but the logistics don't work.  Firstly, he finishes at 630pm and so wouldn't get home until maybe midnight.  Then, in addition, my stepson does football at the weekend so by the time we'd got them back here, it'd honestly be pretty much time to take them back again.  In theory it's a good idea, but unfortunately one that wouldn't work for our setup", "Yes and lives change as dads meet new women. \n\nLike this dad who met OP and she made him move away. \n\nThese kids needed their father and she took him away z", "Is she realistic? She mad him move away from his kids. She\u2019s a fucking peach this one!", "Really? This isn't some random four year old, it is their little sister, and at this age she is old enough to interact with in a meaningful way and be making memories with her siblings. For kids already navigating a shared custody arrangement around their own lives and independence, wanting to spend time with their family isn't unusual at all.", "That 12YO and 14YO are her brother and sister, not just some kids, and THEY ARE. All three or them.", "Yeah, with that information it\u2019s a pretty firm YTA. It really does sound like OP is isolating her husband so the only family he has is *her* family.", "You need to re read comments.  He chose to move to her.  She seems to have no problems with him seeing the kids.  You seem to have a big issue with this", "So your husband spends one to one time with his children whilst they stay,.   So 4 weeks a year and a few hours on alternative weekends that is not a great deal of time in year your husband is spending with his oldest kids.     \n\nDoes he do one to one time with your child with him? \nI think it would be best he still goes up once a fortnight alone or see if they can come and stay once a month but maybe your child and you go up when comfortable for your child.  \n\nIt maybe too late to suggest they come now though but worth discussing.", "Only a week in the summer? Why?", "I think it\u2019s pretty clear why\u2026 if my ex made the choice to move 2 hours away from our kids, I wouldn\u2019t want to help him with transport. He made that bed himself.", "I NEVER said they don't spent any time at our house.  They do during holidays.  He'd have to drive  12 hours to come down just for a weekend and we would have to get them on the saturday as my husband doesnt finish work until 630pm, so it would be midnight by the time they got here. Especially when we can see them at his Dad's house and still have quality time with them because he's hardly there anyway.  They have their own bedrooms at his dads house even.  He sees his kids every single weekend? She just sees them every other weekend. He works 9am to 630pm every single day, so quite how you think he'd have time to see them more than this (even if he lived 20 minutes down the road) is beyond me.  He sees his eldest 2 just as much as he sees our youngest, who he lives with, because she's in bed pretty much every single night when he gets home from work.", "Ps, my stepson does football every Saturday morning.  Kick off is anywhere between 9am and 11am.  By the time he's finished it's usually at least lunchtime.   I love how you've judged on the limited information you've got access to. \ud83d\ude48", "So then have visitation at your house. Seems pretty simple.", "Girl wtf", "Ohhhhh so you are the reason he isn\u2019t living near his kids. \n\nYeah, YTA for pretending to give af.", "If your husband took the train with them a couple of times, so they could learn how to do it and become comfortable, would that work? Could even practice that over winter break with them.", "He\u2019s a grown man. He made his choices. She didn\u2019t *make* him do anything.", "Pretty sure it was his choice, but you wouldnt believe that SOOO...\n\nGet a journal. You're the only one here acting weird.", "Sorry, I should have made it clearer. \n\nSo the set up is that my husband goes every week.  We go for the whole weekend every other week, and one day the alternative (there and back on the day).  This way, he gets time alone with the eldest 2 for the day and time with the youngest when he's at home.  It works. But them coming here is unfortunately not going to work.  My stepson does football which kicks off any time between 9 and 11 and doesn't usually finish until at least lunchtime.  By the time they got here it would be dinner time, and then we'd have to leave by lunchtime on the Sunday to get them back to do their homework (at their mother's request).  Going there means we get more time with them without the travel (for them).", "And we've never expected her to help, hence why we travel to see them so much.  Even when we don't have a car, we make sure we see them by hiring one...", "This sounds like a shitty deal for all kids involved...", "If y'all live 2.5-3.5 hours away from them, then how would it take anyone 12 hours to drive for a visit? What??", "You can\u2019t blame people when you don\u2019t give all the information.", "You've deleted your last comment, but as I said, HE chose to move. I won't go into the details because frankly, its none of your damn business, but trust me - I tried. I moved for him and it didn't work (because of him).  I simply told him I wouldn't move again. I gave him an out.  If he didn't want to move, I wasn't forcing the issue. It was his call, and his alone.", "Lol.  Yes, I am ultimately the reason he lives here, but I didn't choose for him to live here. He made that choice, as their dad, under false pretenses from their mother. And yes, I do care about all of our babies, otherwise why would I post this?  Anonymously under an alias too?", "Ohhhhh ok. It\u2019s the man\u2019s fault no matter what in every situation, she holds no part at all. \n\nLovely.", "Thanks for updating.   As long as the Father Time is not reduced any more then  the time he spend now as it is very limited currently then you are  NTA, teenagers will be spending more time with friends as people commented as their develop their own likes dislikes and independence but they need their parents in their life.", "Football isn\u2019t year round. This travel schedule is not realistic long term. If they want to see their half sister more often then they are going to have to come to your house. Or, depending on how important family is to you and your husband, move closer to his kids.", "Aaaaaand football season is almost over. So that won't be a problem much longer", "I mean, it seems like you\u2019ve cultivated a decent relationship with his kids given they actively want you and your daughter to be a part of their lives. But they\u2019re teens now, this really is not the time to give that up. I could very easily see them taking you and daughter not visiting as not wanting to be around them, favoritism for daughter, favoritism for \u201cyour\u201d family\u2026 just don\u2019t be surprised if they end up with some resentment from seeing you less.", "I'm assuming she means her husband would have to drive 2 1/2 -3 hours to collect them, then the same to bring them to op's house, then the same in reverse the next day. So 5-6 hours travel each day, makes 10-12 hours in a weekend", "It could very easily be 3 hours there, 3 hours back to get them, then 3 hours to drop them back and then 3 hours to drive home?  It makes perfect sense. It could in theory take even longer.", "I didn't think it would need explaining further tbh.", "It is relevant to the situation in your question, so it is *our* business, you made it such by asking the question and your hostile \"defence\" gives credence to their claims that you did push for it and your explanation cements it.\n\nYTA from start to finish.", "No. You literally started your comment with \u201clol\u201d \n\nYou think this is a joke and his children are a joke. You don\u2019t give af about those kids and I wish your husband had a spine. \n\nIt\u2019s best if all of you stayed away from his kids, they would be better off. Hope he screws you just as bad as his last family. You are disgusting.", "A big part of why everyone is saying yta is because you've basically said if your husband wanted to stay with you, he had to move 2 hours away from his other children and you refuse to explain how that isn't your fault in any way. There's no context to you refusing to move to him or to what you told him as far as moving and your relationship or whatever these false pretenses were. You're basically saying \"I'm right because I said so and you guys are crazy to not believe me\" which is typically classic \"I actually did do something messed up in this situation, but I don't want to admit it\".", "Also, I'm in the UK. Football season has only just started. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Unfortunately once football season is over, cricket season starts... we have this all year around!", "But why would y'all not just meet them halfway? That's a pretty standard arrangement with divorced parents who live a good distance from each other", "Well said. OP is being rude and hostile to people for no reason at all.", "The reason I started my comment with lol is because your comment was laughable. What a vile person you are. Enjoy your perfect family set-up, aye?", "Yeah, realized too late it might not be \"my\" football lol", "Because their Mum would never meet us halfway.  There have been 2 occasions where hid dad has driven them halfway, but he's 75 and doesn't make a habit of it.", "Ma\u2019am any woman who loves a man wouldn\u2019t even fix her lips to tell him he has to move 100 miles away from his children, no good father or man would oblige and do that. \n\nMy comment isn\u2019t \u201claughable\u201d, not as much as your fucking character.", "And she shouldn\u2019t have to since you\u2019re the one who insisted on moving.\n\nNTA for the question at hand. But I have a feeling YTA in other ways when it comes to his kids.", "The only thing that's laughable is your assumptions. Get a life.", "We have never expected anything from her, and I absolutely am not thanks.  Those kids are wonderful, and I never insisted on moving.  But take half a story and twist my words all you want. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Oh I have one\u2026. At least I didn\u2019t destroy two children\u2019s relationships with their father to get one tho.", "Your words weren\u2019t twisted. You said you moved and refused to move back. In fact, you\u2019ve made several snarky comments about moving and him \u201cmaking the decision\u201d to pick you or the kids without actually saying those words. So yeah you are. Deny it all you want, but YTA.", "Okay but you said earlier that you moved home and refuse to move back near his kids so which is it?"]}
