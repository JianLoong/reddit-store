A real conversation, setting down rules (you say you gave her food, let her eat from the fridge freely, but did you ever clearly say what the limit was), would probably have made all of you feel better, even if she were fired in the end.

You say she's allowed to take food from the fridge but then call it stealing. Are you mad she didn't eat the food there? You talk about buying her specific groceries. What is the actual agreement?

You pay her the monetary amount for the service and if you feel like you want to help her out more you can tip.

I have a relative in a supervisory role over some very highly paid people, one of which padded his  meal account so he could treat his friends to lunches. He fired his ass.  I said I thought that was a bit much over something so small and his retort was simply that honesty in small things is as important as big things. I pondered that and agree.

She makes good money .\n\nThe thing is , we actually buy her groceries everytime we buy for ourselves . I won't disclose what we do for her but he do help her.\n\nI do appreciate your compassion and the reason I posted here is because I wanted to get a  general opinion on whether I should be hard or have compassion", "This was my reasoning behind firing her. \n\nA simple action would have changed everything. Just the same day I found out about the stealing I told her I would be more than happy to help her with whatever sheet needed at home.", "This !!", "Maybe our cheese costs about that price .", "I know what you mean but given they've said she's like family (presumably to her before) and they do buy her groceries sometimes, I could understand how she might be confused about exactly what the limits are.\n\nHaving said that, she did lie when confronted, which makes me think she did know the limits and was deliberately crossing them.\n\nI don't know - I feel conflicted on this one", "Yeah I think what you've said is very fair, and you do make a good point re the groceries.\n\nI guess my instinct on it would be that the food in their fridge is stuff they've bought for them, so if they're letting me have some, they're probably expecting me to take of that only the amount to satiate me while I'm there. They won't have bought the amount for their fridge anticipating to be feeding me while I'm there and while I'm out of their house.\n\nWhereas the stuff they bought exclusively for me is just a nice gift. They weren't expecting that that would be theirs.\n\nI don't know, I do agree it's a bit confusing though. I think the fact she lied when confronted, rather than saying \"oh I didn't realise I couldnt\" suggests to me she had a similar interpretation of the rules as I did, and was hoping not to get caught.\n\nI don't know - I do they shouldn't have fired her though", "We have cameras but we never checked them because she had our full trust .\n\nSometimes I would be sure I had a lot of milk and then it just wasn't there anymore. I thought well maybe I drank it and didn't realize .\n\nShe was not a full time employee. Just came twice per week \n\nAnd now she was not making a sandwich for the road . She was taking eggs sometimes , and we just checked for three days.\n\nAlso I never mentioned here but we also saw her eating some breakfast and we are completwly fine about that", "Yes, I read that. She can eat what she wants, from the food in the fridge. How should she think this means she is allowed to get her groceries from ops  fridge?", "Im sorry but you're wrong here, nothing here would give me the idea I can pack up whatever I want from your fridge daily, you quoted something they said after they saw her EATING some food, idc how young you are surely you realize the difference between satiating current hunger and packing up some daily?", "Or because they're cheap and would rather buy [insert item here] than fresh produce. Why buy it when you can steal it from your employer?", "Good money? How much?", "I\u2019m the same type of person as you I understand. I tell my friends and family what is mine is theirs food computers etc and the only contingency is that they ask first so I know if something won\u2019t be available or so I can have a mental note of the food item(no one likes thinking about a drink all day to find the last one was taken hours prior) \n\n99% of the time I say sure/of course but some people still have felt the need to just take without asking. Those people I\u2019m no longer involved with. A little trust goes a long way and your lady clearly doesn\u2019t respect it enough", "Definitely not a couple of dollars then. And you should think how much she has accumulatively stole from you these 2 years. In the meantime, you weren't obliged to buy her groceries, you did it out of your good will and misplaced trust. \n\n  As for people saying she is stealing because her family is hungry, it is ridiculously naive. For all we know you might give her an appropriate salary, and she might gamble or saving for a house. \n\nL\n\nLT", "This is exactly why I was conflicted .\n\nShould I give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't know it was wrong ?\n\nCould I have been more clear about the rules ? Absolutely!\n\nI know for a fact she's taking food from my sister's house because she also works there .\n\nMaybe she doesn't know that taking a little bit of good isn't wrong ?\n\nMaybe in couple of months she will think it's ok to take some stuff I haven't used in a while", "I think if she was a good employee and you trusted her, maybe you could have expressed new boundaries. But if she had opportunities to steal money, your identities, etc and didn't then it's most likely she thought it was okay.", "At my office we have snacks and drinks that staff can help themselves too. That doesn't mean that staff can pack those refreshments and take home.", "Yeah, to eat there if you are hungry, is not a free shop that you can take anything you want, also she lied to them when they confront her. To me op isnt confussing , is common sense. NTA.", "I went to a church today. There was a notice in the bathrooms asking people not to steal the toilet rolls. I mean ....cmon.", "With me she made more than the minimum for one week and she only worked two half days", "This was my exact way of thinking , for all I know she only took food. We suspect she might have taken other stuff but we can't prove that it", "i highly doubt that if you did take snacks home with you, you would get fired", "NTA if this is true.", "It\u2019s entirely possible that she can\u2019t actually afford food even if she makes a decent wage. We don\u2019t know the details of her financial situation. I would just talk to her as she is taking food and seemingly nothing else", "I didn't come here to lie", ">You literally just said your thinking is that maybe she\u2019s broke and can\u2019t afford food, then said she makes good money and can easily buy food..\n\nI've looked though what OP has replied. I don't see OP stating that anywhere. Where did you see that?", "\"So you fired her but feel bad? Did you think that maybe she's broke and can't afford the food that you have? She sounds like she's stealing basics, she's probably struggling to make ends meet and now you've taken away her wages.\"\n\n\n\"That was exactly my thinking, I don't think she's short in money because she makes good money working a lot.She could easily buy the food she's taking with her rwage\"\n\n\nThat's literally in the comment thread right above your comment. \"That was exactly my thinking \" only makes sense in response to the questions about her not being able to afford food, but then he immediately contradicts that. And OP says she can easily afford groceries, but that they also buy some groceries for her to help her out. \n\n\nI mean, OP can fire her for whatever reason, it's their house and their money, but I am also confused about the specifics of their arrangement.", "Got it. I was skimming OP's comments but not the comments by other redditors."]}
