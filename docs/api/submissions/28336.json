Like, on day one I\u2019d be like where\u2019s my cheese?", "Info: You said she is part of the house and food is for all of you, so it\u2019s ok for her to eat out of the fridge. Did you ever tell her she couldn\u2019t take the food?", "Why would you be TA for canning someone who steals from you?\n\nThere's a monetary transaction and an implicit promise of trust with anyone who's allowed to work in your house unsupervised. Both must be scrupulously maintained by both sides for it to work.\n\nNTA. This is not Oliver Twist or Les Miserables.", "Why are you asking if you're an AH for firing a thief? NTA.", "NAH because you can fire an employee, particularly for theft or other problematic behavior. You don't want someone you don't trust in your home.\n\nIt seems that after 2 years (during which you NEVER noticed any problem), you considered this person nearly a member of your household. A real conversation, setting down rules (you say you gave her food, let her eat from the fridge freely, but did you ever clearly say what the limit was), would probably have made all of you feel better, even if she were fired in the end. You're not even sure about the deodorant or personal products, and you have cameras.\n\nAgain, if you don't trust her, don't have her in your home, go ahead and fire her. It appears your sister hasn't fired her? Has *she* set limits and said what food is available and what is not?\n\nEdited to NAH from NTA, because I don't believe from this that the housekeeper's and AH either (although it's a possibility of course).", "YTA\n\nI'm confused. You say she's allowed to take food from the fridge but then call it stealing. Are you mad she didn't eat the food there? You talk about buying her specific groceries. What is the actual agreement? It sounds very unclear. \nShe 'may' have stolen deodorant? Is it missing or not? It doesn't seem like the rules are clear. You guys set unclear boundaries.", "NTA - she was stealing, end of story. That really sucks though because you guys sound like you treated her well and helped her out with groceries already.", "Info: when you told her the food is for all of you, did you clarify that doesn\u2019t mean fix meals to take home?\n\nIt sure seems like YTA here. You said help yourself and then fired them when they did. I\u2019d have at least had a conversation with them first and clarified before just immediately firing them. Seems she wasn\u2019t \u201cpart of the house\u201d after all", "YTA. geez get over it, you literally Said she can help herself. She probably gets paid peanuts so who cares.\n\nIf it's a problem maybe just have a conversation with her, no need to fire.\n\nTry see the good in people!", "NTA but I also feel sorry for her if she is taking the food because of rising prices and being unable to afford food \ud83d\ude2a", "NTA. This is problematic behaviour.", "NTA - She has been helping herself to whatever she wants, beyond what you said was alright. Some people take a mile when given an inch. Unfortunately, she's one of them, so she's proven herself untrustworthy.", "absolutely NTA, she did steal from you", "NTA, but I think you guys really need to set better boundaries. I get that you guys are being nice but it\u2019s not normal for your cleaning lady to be helping herself to the contents in your fridge. I know this might come off harsh but your cleaning lady comes to your home for a service. You pay her the monetary amount for the service and if you feel like you want to help her out more you can tip. I don\u2019t think a situation where it is ok for her to help herself to your fridge creates a healthy boundary. There is always going to be gray area in a situation like that. I\u2019d keep that in mind when hiring a new cleaning lady.", "NTA", "NTA in any way", "NTA.

No", "Undisclosed security cameras don\u2019t change the fact that she still stole.

Did you think that maybe she's broke and can't afford the food that you have? She sounds like she's stealing basics, she's probably struggling to make ends meet and now you've taken away her wages.", "That was exactly my thinking, I don't think she's short in money because she makes good money working a lot.\n\nShe could easily buy the food she's taking with her rwage", "You literally just said your thinking is that maybe she\u2019s broke and can\u2019t afford food, then said she makes good money and can easily buy food..\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re conflicted. She\u2019s a thief. This is a crime. Crime also escalates, today it\u2019s food and toiletries, next month it\u2019s jewellery. Who cares if she\u2019s good at her job? FYI she\u2019s not, housekeepers are meant to be trustworthy, so she\u2019s not doing a good job."]}
