You don\u2019t want to \u201ctrap\u201d her into feeling like she has to beg and plead for YOUR money any more than you want her spending more than you know she can. So think about ways to fix that.\n\nThe easiest option: include her on the BIG budget. Make a NEW one together. Me and my husband had to do this (not because we needed to but because I felt bad about how much \u201cI was taking\u201d (I pay the bills and handle everything financially in our house even as a SAHM but that\u2019s us). Literally start with this formula:\n\nStart: Monthly (or weekly whichever works for you)\n- Bill 1\n: total\n- Bill 2\n: total\n- bill 3\n: total\n\n (And so on and so on until ALL the bills are accounted for). This shows you BoTH how much you can play with for everything else like food, personal days, etc. \nNow: from what\u2019s leftover AFTER the bills, create a budget together for food expenses. I\u2019ve found a weekly list for what was being made/cooked that week with sales at my local stores helps me stay on target and under (I set a monthly goal for how much I want to SAVE us that month as part of what I can do to HELP the budget). If the sale item for the week was chicken, we got chicken and I made 2 meals. Add in veggies and so on. You can both figure out which stores you like best and which are the cheapest for the lifestyle you live. Make it FUN! \n\nI also changed my thinking. It\u2019s my husband making the money but I\u2019m home and can help us SAVE. Money coming in and STAYING in is a team effort. You do one, she does the other. Also as a SAHM this little bit made me feel SO much better about myself because I wasn\u2019t just the baby\u2019s play thing all day. Your wife may be going through some things but a task not the baby can help bring her back around. Encourage her to be apart of the money so she\u2019ll think more about the spending.\n\nFinally: special days and treats MUST be accounted for. I mean VERY stringently until savings are built up enough there\u2019s no worry. Took us about 5-6 months to get there. We cut back on eating out, tracked gas expenses, and dedicated ONE day a paycheck to EITHER buying something extra OR having a meal out. Just the ONE.

I put x amount a month aside for the kids and that's my budget for Christmas (like, you have a full year to prepare for it, it's not like it surprises you each year).

This year I'm spoiling my husband with something he really wants that has a higher price tag but I know he won't buy on his own (he doesn't like to spent on himself) but I saved for it.

You need to have ALL of your finances transparent and on the table. You need to discuss budget issues with your Wife NOT your mother.\n\nYou mostly need to realize that you are only earning what you are earning because your wife is at home taking care of things. That money is much hers as it is yours. She should be on ALL of your accounts and have a debit card for spending. She should be an equal partner in ALL money decisions.\n\nYour wife is right.

She can't win if you aren't honest about where you owe and how much, and you won't feel comfortable with her spending if she spends like you don't owe anyone (though right now she doesn't think you do).\n\nMore than that, though, your relationship with money sounds a little bit unhealthy. It sounds like you are either living further out of your means than you're willing to admit or you're running on a scarcity model and stressing yourself out over money to distract from anxiety somewhere else. Just from what you've said, it sounds like you're still contributing to your savings, which is odd if you're still borrowing. Building your savings is important, but putting yourself in debt with loans and credit cards in order to build those savings is paying other people for access to your own money. If your credit is so thinly stretched that you're being denied further credit due to debts owed, you need to be honest and open with her about that, too, because that's dangerous--you can't access emergency funds if you're that tapped and that's something you should prioritize fixing over taking out more money for the holiday. \n\nI think there's NAH, honestly, but only if you fix your reluctance to be open with her about money. If you speak candidly with her about your concerns and she continues to spend carelessly, then she's TA, obviously, but if you don't give her the information she needs (and deserves) in order to course correct, you're TA.", "YTA \n\nESPECIALLY because you made the decision to have a kid that you clearly can\u2019t afford.

So your wife doesn't know how much you earn or have a card of her own? So every time she goes anywhere she has to ask you for money? Yeah no... that's not cool at all. Maybe you need to involve her more in setting the budget together, make sure she can see the finances so she actually understands the reality of the situation.
