So 5 years ago he had a girlfriend (26F) and things seemed to be getting serious he spoke about getting engaged to her but she kept saying no, or laughing it off as if he had made a joke. One day they decide to get wrist tattoos together. He still tried proposing to her but she just kept laughing it off. Two and a half years into the relationship and he caught her cheating on him with her ex Liam and they broke up\n\nAfter a year or so we ended up getting together and everything went well. We got engaged a year ago. I have seen the tattoo before and found it a bit odd but was still fine with it up until I found chats between my fiance and his ex girlfriend, 6 months after we got engaged. He spoke about each time he looked at it, it reminded him of her and the physical scar she left on him. He asked if she removed hers and thats when I found out that she has the same tattoo. They then spoke about the fact that they will always be part of each others lives in a way. \n\nI have asked him to get the tattoo removed or to cover it with another. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that he has the tattoo and makes me feel like I am sharing him with another woman daily. We have been in multiple fights because of this. To me it seems like he doesn't take my feelings into consideration.\n\nI've been trying to find a way to stall our wedding plans as I cannot get married to a man that has a tattoo that reminds him of another woman.", "created_utc": 1704230349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x0nw0/aita_for_asking_my_fiance_to_remove_his_tattoo/", "score": 2252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I don't get why you're not more bothered by the texting itself. I mean it's a tattoo he got with his ex, of course it reminds him of her. But most people would look at getting reminded of a cheating ex as a bad thing. His texts with this ex make it sound like he is remembering her/their relationship fondly and it does not sound like he is over her. If it was me I'd be done after reading those texts. You'd be a fool to marry this man unless you have good reason to believe he is over his ex. And twisting his arm into getting the tattoo removed is not the way.", "NTA\u2026 not sure why everyone is hung up on you knowing of the tattoo when that isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is that you saw texts after the fact that he views the tattoo as an anchor to his ex and will always remember her and vice versa implying he may not be over her, and depending on when these texts are from it is sketchy for sure and looks bad. So I get where you\u2019re coming from and if this is a deal breaker and he isn\u2019t compromising then maybe consider it a sign y\u2019all may not be compatible and consider ending things since if he refuses to compromise the tattoo will always be there and it will build long term resentment and tension.", "I think your problem is that your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t over his ex, not the tattoo.", "Info: \nDid you know what that tattoo meant before you got engaged or did you find that information out after?\nTo be precise, did you always know it was part of a couples tattoo?", "NTA - yeah, you knew he had the tattoo, you didnt know he had feelings attached to it. \n\nMoreso, do you think the feelings will fade without the tattoo? \n\nHe was talking to her, apparently behind your back, and says he wont remove something that makes him think of her. \n\nDoesn't sound like hes willing to leave the past there to me.", "I mean, is this a dealbreaker for you? Because whether or not you\u2019re TA for asking, you *have* asked him to remove it and he doesn\u2019t want to. You can\u2019t keep asking and expect a different response unless you bring something new to the conversation. So are you willing to marry him with the tattoo or not? And are you willing to say \u201cI won\u2019t marry you unless it\u2019s removed\u201d and then risk him ending the relationship?", "I\u2019d be more concerned with those text, frankly. Even if he changes it, he\u2019s still clearly got her on his mind enough to say the things he did.", "Ultimately, you can\u2019t force anyone to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA, I personally think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing. It\u2019s not the tattoo, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s still sending emotionally driven texts to his ex. You said it yourself - you knew about the tattoo and you were fine with it, but that changed when you found out about the texts. \n\nDo you think you\u2019ll trust him after he removes it? Try not to use the tattoo removal as a reason to stall marriage. It seems like the problem would still be there even if it were removed.", "NTA. You are not in the wrong here but you should know that you need to have the guts to walkout because you really can't make someone get rid of a tattoo if they don't want to. Moreover, I think you should also talk to your boyfriend about his chat with his ex-girlfriend.", "INFO do you have a problem with the tattoo, or a problem with his chats with his ex? They are two different things, and covering up the tat will not stop him texting her.", "I mean the tattoo sucks, but the conversations he\u2019s having with his ex suck more. Surely that\u2019s the real issue here ?", "NTA but maybe reconsider marrying someone who would tell an ex that they still think of them after becoming engaged to you. There's a reason he didn't tell you up front that she had the same tattoo. You deserve so much better.", "Why is he talking to his ex 6 months after you got engaged, Are you ok with that? I think you have a BF problem\u2026 You shouldn\u2019t rush into marriage because it sounds like you 2 still have a lot of stuff to work out before making any commitments. (If all we have to go by) from what you\u2019ve written- he sounds like he\u2019s still seeing her\u2026 good luck with that one!  Your NTA for feeling like you do - but- your BF sounds like he may be!", "Maybe you guys rushed into this engagement too fast. Maybe continue to halt the planning and perhaps go to therapy together. This isn't a healthy start to your upcoming marriage.", "NTA\n\nYWBTA to yourself if you stay with this man. He's clearly still hung up on his and you deserve better.", "NTA.  You just need to be willing to walk away if it's that important to you because you can't force him to remove it.  If this is your boundary, yes you should have told him earlier in the relationship, but you are not obligated to marry him if this is a deal breaker for you.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be happy about this, why he want to keep a tattoo that reminds him of someone that cheated? Sounds like he still has feelings.", "He still has feelings for her, don't get married to someone who is still so presently attached to their past. With your engagement is probably romanticizing his past relationships and thinking of what would have been if she had said yes to his proposals. Don't be a placeholder for him.", "NTA - but he\u2019s still hung up on her. he needs to move on.", "NTA. It is so odd he still wants the tattoo there, it doesn\u2019t sound as though he has moved on from her unfortunately especially if they\u2019re still talking. Definitely stall the wedding. I can\u2019t believe he said the physical scar left on him. Honestly the guy doesn\u2019t know what he wants. If he has openly told you he proposed to her multiple times at a young age, then proposed to you relatively quickly and is still speaking to her and has the tattoo.. then he still wants to be with her. He\u2019s trying to find a way to get over her. If he doesn\u2019t want to get it removed, drop him. You\u2019re still very young at 24 to be getting married, and you have your whole life ahead of you. You need to experience more in life, instead of getting married to a guy like this. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting married so young too. There\u2019s more to life.", "NTA\nEww, he wants to keep it? What the hell for? I can't tell you how cringe this is. \nLike, no, get the damn tattoo removed and cut contact with her. Why is he still in contact with her? He's supposed to be your fianc\u00e9.", "Getting rid of that tattoo wont change that he wants to be with her", "The tattoo isn\u2019t the issue the fact that he is still in love with his ex is", "NTA! You\u2019re 24. Do. Not. Settle. There are lots of wonderful men out there and it sounds like he might not be the one for you. You deserve the best. He should be absolutely head over heels, basically obsessed lol. It sounds like that might not be the case. While it may be hard to leave him, it sounds like he really isn\u2019t ready and has some issues to work on from that giant blow to his ego.", "Girl you can't get married to this man simply bc he's still in love with his ex. Not bc of the tattoo.", "Why would he want to keep a tattoo that reminded him of an ex that cheated?", "The tattoo itself should be the least of your concerns. He obviously still has deep feelings for her he was expressing to her while you were together after being engaged to you. \n\nNTA", "I mean if you\u2019re worried about marrying someone with feelings for another, getting him to remove the ink won\u2019t remove his feelings. \n\nI think you\u2019re focussing on the wrong thing. \n\nDoes he still harbor feelings, or is your firsthand experience of their relationship buttressing some insecurities?", "NTA \nHe is thinking about the ex alot though. I'd be pretty guarded about moving forward with the relationship. \nTry to sort out how you want to move forward before  going any further with wedding plans.", "You should be more concerned about him talking intimately with his ex. Don\u2019t marry him.", "Sorry but I would seriously consider removing the boyfriend altogether.", "I wouldn\u2019t be marrying a man who was engaging with his ex and keeping it secret from me. The tattoo is the least of your problems.", "NTA. Girl the issue isn\u2019t the tattoo it\u2019s the fact he\u2019s still talking to and focusing on his EX. You\u2019d be a fool to marry him tbh.", "Your issue isn\u2019t the tattoo. Him removing it won\u2019t solve the problem or change the fact that he isn\u2019t over his ex girlfriend.", "NTA. Run. He would be with her if she wanted him back. You deserve more. So much more.", "Do you think if he removes the tattoo, then he suddenly stops thinking/being connected with his ex? News flash, it\u2019s a part of his history, this won\u2019t change anything.\n\nYour focused on the wrong thing", "A question implies he is free to choose, this seems more like a demand", "NTA what women would want anothers\nwomens tattoo on her man? and also he still thinks about her when he looks at it? deal breaker. i would keep an eye on him and definitely post pone the wedding", "Those convinced against their will, are of the same mind still\u2026.something like that\n\n\nThe issue is not so much the tattoo but the bond he feels and still wants to maintain with this ex. Even if he removed the tattoo, the memory would remind her of her and if he wants, that can be a bond to her still. \n\n\nIf it didn\u2019t mean anything and he didn\u2019t want to maintain that bond, you wouldn\u2019t have to force him.", "If you we\u2019re friends long before you started dating how come you didn\u2019t know about the meaning of the tattoo? And why are you so concerned about that rather than the messages between your man and the woman he never wants to let go of? I think you are not seeing the big picture", "NTA but he doesn't need to get rid of the tattoo. You need to get rid of him. Hugh red flag!", "NTA\n\nI think you should seriously consider ending things with him. He\u2019s not loyal, talking to your ex like that isn\u2019t right. Just picture his face if you told him you read the messages. If he wasn\u2019t doing something dodgy he would have told you they spoke. \n\nI don\u2019t like to just be that guy saying \u201cdump him\u201d but it seems like he isn\u2019t over his ex at all. Run a mile.", "reads like it is a reminder to him of her betrayal and now you are forcing him to remember, but with all the hassle you are likely to split up and at least then you might be happy and so YTA\n\nwould avoid snooping on his phone as he will notice it now", "NAH. You should not rush into a marriage if you don\u2019t feel confident that the two of you can get past this. However people keep tattoos for all sorts of reasons, often associated with pain or loss. Also, it\u2019s not just a tattoo issue. All of us carry with us the memories of old relationships into new relationships - often they make us better partners for the people we ultimately commit to. \n\nMany others have pointed out that the bigger problem is that he hasn\u2019t moved on from that relationship. But I guarantee that telling him what to do and fighting with him and accusing him of not taking your feelings into consideration will ultimately result in him leaving. \n\nHe needs support and compassion and a loving relationship to move on, and if you\u2019re not willing to give him that, that\u2019s fine, go find someone with less baggage. Your \u201cbest\u201d case scenario the way you\u2019re handling things now will be to remove the tattoo, never move on, hide his feelings from you, and go into a marriage resenting you for being hostile towards him instead of supportive.", "The tattoo isn\u2019t the problem.

Lots if red flags here", "YWBTA if you marry this jerk... dont you get the emotional cheating ? come on this is a wake up call he still loves her and you are so young why thinking about marriage ? you should have a stable relationship to get married but yours is everything but stable come on break off the engagement and go find someone who love you", "NTA but lmao he\u2019ll cheat on you with her sis, it\u2019s very obvious he does NOT care about your feelings not even a little bit. Please look at this differently, the man you\u2019re supposed to marry giggling over matching tattoos with his ex who he isn\u2019t over, and texting behind your back, not apologetic in the least.

But you\u2019re right to be upset. The tattoo isn\u2019t the problem though, the texts and his attitude towards his ex are. It\u2019s completely normal for him to still be affected by the cheating because that\u2019s a very significant and horrible thing to go through, but he obviously has some unresolved feelings toward his ex. He may even not have romantic feelings for her, but it\u2019s clear this is affecting him in a way that\u2019s not allowing him to move on from her as a person, not just what she did. This is the bigger issue here and the existence or absence of the tattoo isn\u2019t gonna change that.", "NTA, this is why sane people dont tattoo their partners name on their skin...", "Yes, you are the asshole.

So if we did the unlikely thing and assumed that bf and ex started dating 5 years ago instead of already dating at that point, then that would mean they have been together for at least 1\u00bd years", "Absolutely agree. It's the text messages. Even if we disregard the tattoo for a minute, reading these text messages between your to be husband and his ex of 5 years can be unnerving.", "I (M) would have it removed the earliest I could after finding out she cheated.", "Not only that, but his ex has no morals and has a track record  of hooking up with her exes and he loved her enough  to ask her to marry him multiple times and enough  to get matching tats (Which is never a good idea .IMO) Now she and him are texting and essentially reminiscing on their time together. Only 6m after he proposed  to OP IMO, it seems as if she wants him, and she can probably take him. Two things here: either he told her he just got engaged, and she sees this as a challenge to prove she can have anyone she wants or she found out through a mutual friend and is testing the tempature of the water to get back with him long enough to screw up any potential happiness he might create  with OP .OP's man has already failed by engaging in any interaction with his ex, considering how things ended . I he truly gave a crap about OP he wouldn't be entertaining herand like I said he knows all to well he didn't  walk away from the Ex his hand was forced by catching  her cheating  with  her ex. What kind of narcissist convinces someone  to get matching tattoos when she knowingly is cheating on that person.  On the information provided, as I read it, his ex is the kind of woman  that gets off on knowing she can take her exes from anyone and get them to do anything even destroy  their own happiness. I know a lot of people  like this .( men and women).  It is an ego boost.\nAsk him if he still wants to marry you or if he is planning on hooking back up with her, and if he says you tell him that tat and him talking to her is a deal breaker. If he says her, tell him goodbye lick your wounds and don't  look back because I personally already  think you deserve better.  It is up to you to teach others your value.", "They\u2019ve got a bigger problem than just the tattoo, the partner is still in love with the ex who cheated so if anything the dude has to prove he\u2019s over his ex and can start by getting it removed or covered to show he\u2019s serious and even that\u2019s just scratching the surface.", "A partner who died and a partner you broke up with are fundamentally  different.\n\nWhen you break up with someone the relationship ended in a different way to death. Not to mention you cant cheat with a dead spouse.\n\nBut yes, people also shouldn't date until they are ready to move suffi6oast their grief to make a new ladtner feel loved.", "Since you wanna play stupid let me answer that, no because the former partner is DEAD and it\u2019s ashes you can\u2019t cheat with a vase of ashes (I\u2019m sure someone\u2019s probably done it but I digress). The two scenarios are not even remotely similar\u2026 one is a matching tattoo with an ex he remembers fondly and refused to compromise for their partner whilst other is a dead spouse. \u2620\ufe0f", "To make it a more accurate comparison, I wouldn\u2019t ask a partner to remove a tattoo that they got that reminds them of their deceased partner.\n\nOr, if you want to stick with ashes, then I wouldn\u2019t ask someone to get rid of their deceased partner\u2019s ashes, but if they were keeping their still living ex in a box in the house, then I would absolutely step in and stop that.", "Getting betrayed doesn\u2019t stop you from loving someone, it just makes you feel betrayed.", "Well that was an obvious lie. The tattoo is a symptom of the actual problem. Him removing the tattoo won\u2018t solve the problem.", "The opposite of love is indifference. I'm sorry, he may still love her.", "If this is true, why is he still talking to her?", "If he truly felt that way, he\u2019d block her and never look back. He cares a lot.", "Sounds like he had a rebound with the girl who was always in the friend zone whilst he was besotted with someone else. OP cant see that he clearly doesnt feem nearly as strongly for her ad he STILL feels about his ex.", "In his mind, she is the one who got away. He knows firsthand that being her ex not available yet available, he can create a scenario that she is choosing him over anyone she is currently with. I have no doubt  his ex is with someone because people like her always have an ACE in the hole. The only person I see getting hurt in this is his backup wife.", "I have a scar on my forehead from the time I had chickenpox as a kid and I scratched too hard. But when I see it I'll always remember having basically two weeks of holidays I spent with my best friend playing football in my garden. That was 30 years ago. I wouldn't remember it otherwise because we are not friends anymore. Not because anything anyone of us did we just lived different lifes and haven't seen each other for about 20 years.", "He sends the ex text messages reminiscing about how much the tattoo reminds him if her and their time together.\n\nI don't think he'd WANT to remove the tattoo, because he is clearly not over the ex.", "No details are included, but tbh, I suspect that she was caught cheating in a way that made it impossible for him to ignore or get past. That or else he broke up with her in the heat of the moment and regretted it. I\u2019m pretty sure this guy would forgive cheating in the right circumstances.", "My second husband told me \u201cIf so and so ever came back for me, I\u2019d go back to her\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t believe she would, after hearing their history, but told him I would be gone for good if that ever happened. \n\nShe came back 10 years later, trying to reconnect, so I left and never went back.\n\nFunny story, in the end, she didn\u2019t leave her husband, and he lost his job and ended up selling the house to live in a duplex with his mom (he\u2019s in his 50\u2019s).\n\nI\u2019m in a much better place.", "This ex could literally have her fianc\u00e9 back whenever she wanted\u2026", "And what kind of mental gymnastics did it take for the fiance to propose to someone multiple times who was never going to say yes? They all need separate corners.", "Exactly. Getting rid of the tattoo won\u2019t fix the relationship, but, given his feelings on it, the relationship can\u2019t be fixed as long as he has the tattoo.", "That is not emotional cheating", "Absolutely this is giving \"the girl he told you n8t to worry about\" vibes.\n\nThe opposite of live is not hate or upset, it is indifference. And he us clearly NOT indifferent to his ex. And despite telling YOU he isnt fond of her he sends her loving messages reminiscing about the past. \n\nThose messages suggest he isbt telling the whole truth in what he says.", "It sounds like he hurried up and got engaged to op just to make the ex jealous hoping she\u2019d feel some type of way, not thinking it\u2019d go this far. Just to be like, hey you rejected my proposal and cheated on me so I\u2019ll make you jealous by getting what I want ie. marriage.. but not to you so to speak, to be petty thinking she\u2019d come crawling back. And if she did he\u2019d def have her back. \nI\u2019m not saying this to be mean op. I swear. You\u2019re NTA. \nI would take a giant leap back and think about his words here, with what he\u2019s saying by not saying\u2026 cause he needs to have a convo with you and be honest. Do that before marriage pls.\n\nEdited for typos.", "She\u2019s his second choice. The first choice didn\u2019t work out so he\u2019s settling. He obviously didn\u2019t pick her first.", "Sure, but what if anything was her \u2018role\u2019 in his previous relationship or in ending it?\n\nSounds like she was on a mission to get and now control the bro.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best judge of this question. I have a lot of tattoos. I mean, what if everyone I get with ends up not liking one or more of them? Haha. I got every one of them with the intention of them being permanent. To me, this is like asking someone to remove a birthmark. They are a part of you usually once you get them. You accept someone with them or you don\u2019t and move on.\n\nI do have a little bit of a bias here though. I do have a tattoo that I share with a deceased partner. There is no way in hell I would ever cover this tattoo up or remove it. If I had to choose between being single for the rest of my life as to not upset a future partner or remove it I\u2019d choose to be lonely. I would hope it would never come to that though.", "Whenever I see mention of the Iranian yoghurt I know all is right with the world. Thank you.", "Obviously if she chooses to ignore the all so obvious red flags, then that would be her pot of salt to lick.!", "Yes... And the fact that, from the texts, he seemed more than ok with the forever connection with the cheating ex SHOULD be disturbing to OP.", "What? You wanna wait for them to get to the point of overtly telling each other they miss each other and still love each other? I\u2019d be so pissed if my boyfriend was DMing his ex saying how he will always be tied to her and remember her forever. That\u2019s fucked up.", "A deceased partner is very different, though. You were separated by death not by choosing to break up. And you cant leave a new partner for or cheat on them with a deceased partner. Or text them that you're still obsessing over them.", "Not sure what post you\u2019re reading. It\u2019s a **wrist** tattoo and she makes no mention of it having anyone\u2019s name. And she makes no mention of any other tattoos, neck or otherwise.", "Are....you drunk? Or high? This is a matching wrist tattoo. No names, no neck.", "Omg I missed something\u2026", "I just snort with laughter.", "I mean a tattoo is pretty fucking bad. Texts are also pretty fucking bad. But put them together and he literally spelled out, exactly why, he still has the tattoo. Being in love sucks sometimes. She\u2019s blinded by what she wants to believe is true, instead of ignoring the facts in front of her\u2026 he spelled it out, word for word\u2026with the texts.", "Maybe it's just me, but that's not hard to believe. My husband's phone is always dying because he never locks it. And if he uses my phone to Google something or whatever b/c his phone is dead (because he always leaves the screen on), he doesn't lock mine either. \n\nHe could have been messaging his ex then left the room w/o leaving the chat. People never want to believe in the likelihood of others doing something different than what they deem normal.", "once you've found something out,  it doesn't really matter how you find out.... you still have to deal with what you found.", "Or he wanted her to see it NTA but she'd be a fool to marry this man", "My ex used to borrow my laptop. The catalyst for our breakup was when I went home after staying at his place for the weekend and opened my laptop to find he\u2019d left his email open to something sent from his ex. That particular email wasn\u2019t incriminating, but I was so surprised by it, you\u2019re damn right I read a few others. When I confronted him, he was surprised and hadn\u2019t realized he left his email open. People are dumb.", "I mean, those are trust issues though. Not issues relating to a tattoo. I think OP needs to be honest with themselves and really look at the route of the problem. Even if he removes the tattoo he can still do all those things.\n\nEdit: also thanks for telling me it\u2019s different. I do worry about it.", "Someone will probably link it, but the short version is someone\u2019s boyfriend collected yogurts from other countries and kept it in the fridge. He allegedly obtained yogurt from Iran and Cubs, leading to an argument where the phrase, \u201cThe Iranian yogurt is not the issue here.\u201d", "I think that his behavior about the tattoo is even more telling. She repeatedly said no to marriage and in the middle of this, he still got a tattoo with her. He was willing to take whatever crumbs she offered and that\u2019s what makes the relationship even shakier. It would be bad if OP knew that he would dump her if the ex showed any interest in getting together. I think this guy would dump the OP is the ex show that she might possibly consider getting back with him in some capacity. And even if that never happens, if she chooses to, she could probably have him jumping through hoops for her.", "\ud83c\udfaf", "A marriage license doesn't negate personal privacy", "I completely get that. However, even without a lock, I don\u2019t think her fianc\u00e9 would leave old texts from his ex up, especially when asking her to go get his phone. Again, I completely understand not having a lock or passcode, but the math just isn\u2019t mathing here for me.", "We have absolutely no idea when these texts are from. So, yes, once you know you still need to navigate it. However, if we\u2019re talking about texts from when they were together, that\u2019s a whole different story.", "I have 2 tats. One was a nickname (it's an animal image) I was given by the father of my daughter. We were together a long time. He cheated on me and I moved on. Still have the ink. Not because of him and the nickname, but because the animal does represent me.\n\nThe second was hand drawn by an ex and he asked me to get it inked. I chose to, not because he drew it but because I liked the message. I was pretty sure we would break up eventually and that's a whole other story, but I still have that ink too.\n\nI'm now married and my husband knows the story behind both. Alls well for both of us. They are links to my story and like the memories or not, it's my story to tell on my skin just as yours is. I also would choose to be alone over changing the story, and I agree this post is not about the tat. The tat doesn't change the problem or cause it.", "\n\n[here ya go, iranian yogurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/UHvcc3sp60)"]}
