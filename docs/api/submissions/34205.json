So 5 years ago he had a girlfriend (26F) and things seemed to be getting serious he spoke about getting engaged to her but she kept saying no, or laughing it off as if he had made a joke. One day they decide to get wrist tattoos together. He still tried proposing to her but she just kept laughing it off. Two and a half years into the relationship and he caught her cheating on him with her ex Liam and they broke up\n\nAfter a year or so we ended up getting together and everything went well. We got engaged a year ago. I have seen the tattoo before and found it a bit odd but was still fine with it up until I found chats between my fiance and his ex girlfriend, 6 months after we got engaged. He spoke about each time he looked at it, it reminded him of her and the physical scar she left on him. He asked if she removed hers and thats when I found out that she has the same tattoo. They then spoke about the fact that they will always be part of each others lives in a way. \n\nI have asked him to get the tattoo removed or to cover it with another. It makes me uncomfortable knowing that he has the tattoo and makes me feel like I am sharing him with another woman daily. We have been in multiple fights because of this. To me it seems like he doesn't take my feelings into consideration.\n\nI've been trying to find a way to stall our wedding plans as I cannot get married to a man that has a tattoo that reminds him of another woman.", "created_utc": 1704230349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x0nw0/aita_for_asking_my_fiance_to_remove_his_tattoo/", "score": 575, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I don't get why you're not more bothered by the texting itself. I mean it's a tattoo he got with his ex, of course it reminds him of her. But most people would look at getting reminded of a cheating ex as a bad thing. His texts with this ex make it sound like he is remembering her/their relationship fondly and it does not sound like he is over her. If it was me I'd be done after reading those texts. You'd be a fool to marry this man unless you have good reason to believe he is over his ex. And twisting his arm into getting the tattoo removed is not the way.", "NTA\u2026 not sure why everyone is hung up on you knowing of the tattoo when that isn\u2019t the issue. The issue is that you saw texts after the fact that he views the tattoo as an anchor to his ex and will always remember her and vice versa implying he may not be over her, and depending on when these texts are from it is sketchy for sure and looks bad. So I get where you\u2019re coming from and if this is a deal breaker and he isn\u2019t compromising then maybe consider it a sign y\u2019all may not be compatible and consider ending things since if he refuses to compromise the tattoo will always be there and it will build long term resentment and tension.", "I think your problem is that your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t over his ex, not the tattoo.", "Info: \nDid you know what that tattoo meant before you got engaged or did you find that information out after?\nTo be precise, did you always know it was part of a couples tattoo?", "NTA - yeah, you knew he had the tattoo, you didnt know he had feelings attached to it. \n\nMoreso, do you think the feelings will fade without the tattoo? \n\nHe was talking to her, apparently behind your back, and says he wont remove something that makes him think of her. \n\nDoesn't sound like hes willing to leave the past there to me.", "I mean, is this a dealbreaker for you? Because whether or not you\u2019re TA for asking, you *have* asked him to remove it and he doesn\u2019t want to. You can\u2019t keep asking and expect a different response unless you bring something new to the conversation. So are you willing to marry him with the tattoo or not? And are you willing to say \u201cI won\u2019t marry you unless it\u2019s removed\u201d and then risk him ending the relationship?", "I\u2019d be more concerned with those text, frankly. Even if he changes it, he\u2019s still clearly got her on his mind enough to say the things he did.", "Ultimately, you can\u2019t force anyone to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA, I personally think you\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing. It\u2019s not the tattoo, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s still sending emotionally driven texts to his ex. You said it yourself - you knew about the tattoo and you were fine with it, but that changed when you found out about the texts. \n\nDo you think you\u2019ll trust him after he removes it? Try not to use the tattoo removal as a reason to stall marriage. It seems like the problem would still be there even if it were removed.", "NTA. You are not in the wrong here but you should know that you need to have the guts to walkout because you really can't make someone get rid of a tattoo if they don't want to. Moreover, I think you should also talk to your boyfriend about his chat with his ex-girlfriend.", "INFO do you have a problem with the tattoo, or a problem with his chats with his ex? They are two different things, and covering up the tat will not stop him texting her.", "I mean the tattoo sucks, but the conversations he\u2019s having with his ex suck more. Surely that\u2019s the real issue here ?", "NTA but maybe reconsider marrying someone who would tell an ex that they still think of them after becoming engaged to you. There's a reason he didn't tell you up front that she had the same tattoo. You deserve so much better.", "Why is he talking to his ex 6 months after you got engaged, Are you ok with that? I think you have a BF problem. You shouldn\u2019t rush into marriage because it appears that you 2 still have a lot of stuff to work out before making any commitments. If all we have to go by from what you\u2019ve written- he sounds like he\u2019s still seeing her\u2026 good luck with that one!  Your NTA for feeling like you do - but- your BF sounds like he may be!", "Maybe you guys rushed into this engagement too fast. Maybe continue to halt the planning and perhaps go to therapy together. This isn't a healthy start to your upcoming marriage.", "NTA\n\nYWBTA to yourself if you stay with this man. He's clearly still hung up on his and you deserve better.", "NTA.  You just need to be willing to walk away if it's that important to you because you can't force him to remove it.  If this is your boundary, yes you should have told him earlier in the relationship, but you are not obligated to marry him if this is a deal breaker for you.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be happy about this, why he want to keep a tattoo that reminds him of someone that cheated? Sounds like he still has feelings.", "He still has feelings for her, don't get married to someone who is still so presently attached to their past. With your engagement is probably romanticizing his past relationships and thinking of what would have been if she had said yes to his proposals. Don't be a placeholder for him.", "NTA - but he\u2019s still hung up on her. he needs to move on.", "NTA. It is so odd he still wants the tattoo there, it doesn\u2019t sound as though he has moved on from her unfortunately especially if they\u2019re still talking. Definitely stall the wedding. I can\u2019t believe he said the physical scar left on him. Honestly the guy doesn\u2019t know what he wants. If he has openly told you he proposed to her multiple times at a young age, then proposed to you relatively quickly and is still speaking to her and has the tattoo.. then he still wants to be with her. He\u2019s trying to find a way to get over her. If he doesn\u2019t want to get it removed, drop him. You\u2019re still very young at 24 to be getting married, and you have your whole life ahead of you. You need to experience more in life, instead of getting married to a guy like this. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting married so young too. There\u2019s more to life.", "NTA\nEww, he wants to keep it? What the hell for? I can't tell you how cringe this is. \nLike, no, get the damn tattoo removed and cut contact with her. Why is he still in contact with her? He's supposed to be your fianc\u00e9.", "Getting rid of that tattoo wont change that he wants to be with her", "The tattoo isn\u2019t the issue the fact that he is still in love with his ex is", "NTA! You\u2019re 24. Do. Not. Settle. There are lots of wonderful men out there and it sounds like he might not be the one for you. You deserve the best. He should be absolutely head over heels, basically obsessed lol. It sounds like that might not be the case. While it may be hard to leave him, it sounds like he really isn\u2019t ready and has some issues to work on from that giant blow to his ego.", "Girl you can't get married to this man simply bc he's still in love with his ex. Not bc of the tattoo.", "Why would he want to keep a tattoo that reminded him of an ex that cheated?", "The tattoo itself should be the least of your concerns. He obviously still has deep feelings for her he was expressing to her while you were together after being engaged to you. \n\nNTA", "I mean if you\u2019re worried about marrying someone with feelings for another, getting him to remove the ink won\u2019t remove his feelings. \n\nI think you\u2019re focussing on the wrong thing. \n\nDoes he still harbor feelings, or is your firsthand experience of their relationship buttressing some insecurities?", "NTA \nHe is thinking about the ex alot though. I'd be pretty guarded about moving forward with the relationship. \nTry to sort out how you want to move forward before  going any further with wedding plans.", "You should be more concerned about him talking intimately with his ex. Don\u2019t marry him.", "Sorry but I would seriously consider removing the boyfriend altogether.", "I wouldn\u2019t be marrying a man who was engaging with his ex and keeping it secret from me. The tattoo is the least of your problems.", "NTA. Girl the issue isn\u2019t the tattoo it\u2019s the fact he\u2019s still talking to and focusing on his EX. You\u2019d be a fool to marry him tbh.", "Your issue isn\u2019t the tattoo. Him removing it won\u2019t solve the problem or change the fact that he isn\u2019t over his ex girlfriend.", "NTA. Run. He would be with her if she wanted him back. You deserve more. So much more.", "Do you think if he removes the tattoo, then he suddenly stops thinking/being connected with his ex? News flash, it\u2019s a part of his history, this won\u2019t change anything.\n\nYour focused on the wrong thing", "A question implies he is free to choose, this seems more like a demand", "NTA what women would want anothers\nwomens tattoo on her man? and also he still thinks about her when he looks at it? deal breaker. i would keep an eye on him and definitely post pone the wedding", "Those convinced against their will, are of the same mind still\u2026.something like that\n\n\nThe issue is not so much the tattoo but the bond he feels and still wants to maintain with this ex. Even if he removed the tattoo, the memory would remind her of her and if he wants, that can be a bond to her still. \n\n\nIf it didn\u2019t mean anything and he didn\u2019t want to maintain that bond, you wouldn\u2019t have to force him.", "If you we\u2019re friends long before you started dating how come you didn\u2019t know about the meaning of the tattoo? And why are you so concerned about that rather than the messages between your man and the woman he never wants to let go of? I think you are not seeing the big picture", "NTA but he doesn't need to get rid of the tattoo. You need to get rid of him. Hugh red flag!", "NTA\n\nI think you should seriously consider ending things with him. He\u2019s not loyal, talking to your ex like that isn\u2019t right. Just picture his face if you told him you read the messages. If he wasn\u2019t doing something dodgy he would have told you they spoke. \n\nI don\u2019t like to just be that guy saying \u201cdump him\u201d but it seems like he isn\u2019t over his ex at all. Run a mile.", "reads like it is a reminder to him of her betrayal and now you are forcing him to remember, but with all the hassle you are likely to split up and at least then you might be happy and so YTA\n\nwould avoid snooping on his phone as he will notice it now", "NAH. You should not rush into a marriage if you don\u2019t feel confident that the two of you can get past this. However people keep tattoos for all sorts of reasons, often associated with pain or loss. Also, it\u2019s not just a tattoo issue. All of us carry with us the memories of old relationships into new relationships - often they make us better partners for the people we ultimately commit to. \n\nMany others have pointed out that the bigger problem is that he hasn\u2019t moved on from that relationship. But I guarantee that telling him what to do and fighting with him and accusing him of not taking your feelings into consideration will ultimately result in him leaving. \n\nHe needs support and compassion and a loving relationship to move on, and if you\u2019re not willing to give him that, that\u2019s fine, go find someone with less baggage. Your \u201cbest\u201d case scenario the way you\u2019re handling things now will be to remove the tattoo, never move on, hide his feelings from you, and go into a marriage resenting you for being hostile towards him instead of supportive.", "The tattoo isn\u2019t the problem.

Lots if red flags here", "YWBTA if you marry this jerk... dont you get the emotional cheating ? come on this is a wake up call he still loves her and you are so young why thinking about marriage ? you should have a stable relationship to get married but yours is everything but stable come on break off the engagement and go find someone who love you", "NTA but lmao he\u2019ll cheat on you with her sis, it\u2019s very obvious he does NOT care about your feelings not even a little bit. Please look at this differently, the man you\u2019re supposed to marry giggling over matching tattoos with his ex who he isn\u2019t over, and texting behind your back, not apologetic in the least.

Removing/covering up a tattoo is costly and has a recovery period and is generally just not a simple, short process, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that reasonable to ask him to do. But you\u2019re right to be upset. The tattoo isn\u2019t the problem though, the texts and his attitude towards his ex are. It\u2019s completely normal for him to still be affected by the cheating because that\u2019s a very significant and horrible thing to go through, but he obviously has some unresolved feelings toward his ex. He may even not have romantic feelings for her, but it\u2019s clear this is affecting him in a way that\u2019s not allowing him to move on from her as a person, not just what she did.

I would like to hear more about her being \u2018friends\u2019 with the guy for years while he kept proposing to his then flame \ud83d\ude05.", "As long as the tatoo is more important than OP he will text to her, because she is more important to him than OP.", "Unfortunately for op it sounds like she\u2019s a placeholder and her bf is still hung up on his ex.", "Please don\u2019t remain engaged to a man who is settling for you.", "Exactly this.", "Yes. Unless he and the ex have mutual children, my opinion is that there should be no contact. I understand there are different schools of thought on this but you should find someone who shares your philosophy on contact with exes.", "Believe it or not some people like memories of the lows and hard parts of their life. The obstacles they\u2019ve over come and the life lessons they never want to have to learn again. Keeps some people grounded.", "All healthy relationships are based on ultimatums disguised as \u2018respect for you\u2019. \n\nGreat advice.", "I feel like we need more info on the messages part for sure. was the messages recent? Was it when they first got the tattoos? It matters a lot in this case", "Couldn't agree more. Can't believe there are so many people responding differently in this thread. If she is feeling insecure, that's her work to do internally. He can support her as she builds the emotional intelligence to be able to push through that but he is by no means obligated to alter his body in any way.", "The problem is the message and the meaning + how he sees the tattoo as a permanent tie to his ex rather than the tattoo being from that relationship itself,", "If its just a tattoo, he simply removes it and everybody is happy", "The problem seems to stem more from the messages from what I read rather than the tattoo itself initially", "In the beginning when I wrote this I used all their names. But then I decided to remove the names and forgot to remove his name. So yes incredibly random but not odd just an honest mistake.", "Meh, I say you\u2019re only the ah for checking their messages if you\u2019re wrong about them cheating. OP wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s emotionally cheating.", "And for shits and giggles, the matching set is wrists tattoos.", "That's true. I think I glossed over that part and focused more on the fact that he was telling his ex this. So if he actually is looking at it negatively then I don't see why he wouldn't be open to removing it or covering it. I sure would want to. The only reason I could see to refuse to cover aside from him still being hung up on his ex would be that it is expensive.", "Yeah I was gonna say, he may not have the funds to cover or remove the tattoo. But I think if that was the case it should have been mentioned.", "Not that big of a deal.  Expensive but people pay more for fake boobs.", "So what does OP get for ignoring the obvious signs that bf hadn't moved on?  There are some mental gymnastics going on, to get all the way to marriage..", "How did you find out? And how did you find the texts/when were they from?", "And those DMs? I\u2019d he feels so betrayed and hurt and doesn\u2019t want to be with her why is he DMing her like that. What he did is emotional cheating. I\u2019d get out of there.", "Betrayal is a feeling. Definitely some unresolved issues there. NTA", "Sorry but he would drop you for her without even a thought.", "OP if he doesn't feel anything for her then why is he refusing to cover or remove that tattoo? Why does he want a constant reminder of the girl that had so little respect for him that she cheated on him? \n\nTell him actions speak louder than words, and since his actions don't match his words why should you stay with him?", "They eventually get over it. My ex husbands paramour cheated on him with her step brother and he still managed to forgive her after so many years and initiate a fling.", "NTA he is showing you that he doesn\u2019t care about your feelings, he still wants that connection with his ex. You should put wedding planning on hold but don\u2019t be coy or secretive about it, tell him the reason for your reservations and how he reacts will tell you whether you should marry him or not.", "Don't rush into marriage with this guy. You're his rebound relationship, and unfortunately, those are not sustainable. Maybe take some time to yourself and review things. The tattoo is the visible indicator that he'll never be over his ex. The messages are all you need to know. You'll never be number one in his heart. He's settled with you so he doesn't have to be alone.", "If you feel like you can trust that, then your only decision is if some ink is a deal breaker between you and happiness. \n\nEveryone has a past, just depends on your trust and how much you can move past.", "Then he should know what he is doing to you and stop", "If someone betrayed me \"in the worst possible way\", I wouldn't want to keep having a reminder of them on my flesh.\n\nIf I couldn't have removed the tattoo completely... yeah, I wouldn't have even covered it. I'd just remove it.  Like why would I need a reminded of being hurt by someone I now either hate or don't care about etched permanently into my skin?", "He doesn't feel anything for her as she betrayed him \"in the worst possible way\".  Yet, the betrayal doesn't prohibit him from wanting to text with her and admit they will always have a connection?  \n\n\nThe worst ex I had (too long of a story) finally broke things off with me about 11 years ago (I should have broken it off sooner, but, ya know...reasons). Anyway, some of it involved betrayal. She had a pretty steady routine of texting me at least once a year (with her apologizing, or her saying she made a huge mistake, or anything she could say to get talking again at least.)  I only replied one time (because I wanted an answer to a specific question). Other than that, fuck her. She actually stopped about 3 years for almost 2 years. One day I realized \"wow...she hasn't tried any texts in awhile\", she texted me the next day.   I still didn't respond. I also didn't try looking up her current husband's information to let him know she texted me.", "Don\u2019t trust his words. Look at his actions - won\u2019t remove the tattoo, sending her texts about their emotional connection - and see the truth.", "I'm 44. What else is he suppose to say...I'm an idiot for still being in love with a person that cheated on me, and can't seem to stop texting her about our tattoos that meant something about our time because that's totally normal and not inappropriate.  Emotional cheating is what he is doing and saying of course I don't love her she cheated is gaslighting  because many stay with eachother after cheating...she obviously chose to not fight to stay with him ie please forgive me I made a mistake.  Lowkey had she begged him he would have taken her back. She should be insignificant.  I had great loves and one cheated as much as it hurt me, as much as I could have stayed I chose me and dropped him like a bad habit. Cut him off after 4 years, changed my number, gave him no closure as he didn't deserve that from me and left him forever wondering how I could just one day leave him without warning. He's still in love with her but knows she doesn't want him so you are safe. She talks to him because she's obviously a player that doesn't respect relationships and like a narcissist loves the fact he secretly still wants her even though he's engaged to you. It's a flex to her ego.", "That's not a \"good\" answer.  A good answer would be she is no longer interesting to him.  The answer he gave is essentially, \"she's perfect for me if I only got over the betrayal.\"", "So do you think pressuring him into removing the tattoo will make him forget about his ex and move OP higher up in his mental hierarchy?\n\nThe tattoo is obviously just a symptom. Point being, covering up the symptom doesn\u2019t cure anything.", "If they have mutual children. Yes, I'd expect there to be contact. However, if this isn't the case, then I definitely agree finding someone with the same view on exes and communication would probably be for the best.", "Even if it makes someone you are with romantically, uncomfortable? I get what you are saying, and there is nothing wrong with remembering struggle but a romantic based tattoo on someone who you are no longer in a relationship with? When you have supposedly moved on and are going to join your life with another?", "Yes.\n\nIf my SO would want to wear the engagement ring from his ex he is secretly texting to, I would end the relationship because he dont love and dont respect me.", "I\u2019d like to know if OP is going to pay for the tattoo removal.  It\u2019s not exactly cheap.", "Tattoos aren't just simply removed.", "Ok that's a separate issue altogether", "She states clearly that she didn\u2019t know it was a matching tattoo with his ex-fianc\u00e9e until she saw the texts. So all she knew was that he had a tattoo. She didn\u2019t know its history \u2018til she saw the texts recently.", "fr. the ~~Iranian yoghurt~~ tattoo really isn't the problem here.", "No mental gymnastics here.  Just keep up ;)", "It was 6 months after we got engaged. He asked me to go fetch his phone from the room and I saw the chat laying open on his bedside table. And that when I found out what it meant and that she also has one cause he asked her if she removed hers or not.", "No, I think if he really loves and respect OP he will just remove the tattoo without any discussion.\n\nIf ne dont want to, OP know his ex is still more important to him", "Nobody is talking about engagement rings here but you. \n\nIt\u2019s not relevant.", "Oh for sure. My takeaway from the post is because the tattoo is a reminder and the messages clearly outlined that she\u2019ll always be a part of him = main issue, so it\u2019s definitely not the tattoo itself but the messages and him speaking to his ex which imo already sounds like a shotty situation to be in", "So, OP at no point got the courage to ask:\n\n\"So, who is Angela, anyway?\"\n\nBefore marrying a man with a neck tattoo.  \n\nShe married a man without knowledge of the person who earned a tattoo on his neck.", "Oh know, I'm not prepared for a mental marathon!", "To be clear, you want us to believe his phone was open to a recent chat with an ex girlfriend while he was in a completely different room, and that despite being together for what seems like 3+ years and being friends beforehand and saying \u201cI was fine with the tattoo until I saw the texts\u201d, you actually didn\u2019t know until 6 months after being engaged? \n\nFine, we can throw you a bone and assume that\u2019s true. But I think it still begs the question \u201cso what now?\u201d He\u2019s already told you he doesn\u2019t want it removed. So will you marry him anyway or lose the relationship to not marry him with the tattoo?", "This comment calls your bluff. I highly, highly doubt that his messages were just open on the night stand. Even if they were, the phone wasn\u2019t just unlocked, especially if he asked you to go get it (he wasn\u2019t actively using it). You\u2019re trying to get people on your side and it\u2019s decisive as hell.", "lol you snooped", "The phone was open (what, no sleep timer?) to incriminating chats left in the open and then he asks you to get that phone for him?  Lol nobody is going to believe that. Just fess up and state you were snooping. \n\nAt least add some truth to your replies.", "I kinda wonder if he wanted you to find the texts so that you will break up with him giving him an easy out to be with his ex", "Then wouldn\u2019t he have done it by now?\n\nIf OP doesn\u2019t want to be with a guy with an ex\u2019s tattoo, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten engaged to one. Pressing the issue now accomplishes nothing.", "We are talking about romantic Symbols that represent a relationship or not?\n\nIf the relationship to his ex is over, he would have no problem in removing the tattoo for OP", "You're right the messages is what makes it bad look on his part", "Funnily enough (or not) my ex used to purposely leave chats open and find ways for me to find messages of him doing wrong. He was abusive and is a narcissist so when I would find the messages to confront him about it, it was exactly what he set up to want so he would find a way to make it my fault for confronting him and \u2018snooping\u2019. So believe me it happens.", "Your spouse or future spouse should have unlimited access to any account or device you own anytime they want. If you\u2019re hiding things from each other that\u2019s not an authentic relationship.", "If my math is mathing they\u2019ve only been together 1.5 years. Actually it might be more than that. I can\u2019t tell if he and his ex broke up five years ago or he and his ex started dating five years ago", "You'd be surprised how many people I know who don't even have a lock on their phone, shit is on free access 24/7.", "Lol if only. He doesn't lock his phone so it would be easy.", "Pressing the issue now accomplishes nothing yes, but she should just leave his ass instead. As long has he has that tattoo it proves he cares more for his ex than her.", "Maybe he didnt think about how it makes OP feel or he is just to lazy. I dont know him", "Bullshit.  My tattoos are all memories of events, people, things I loved a some point.  Nobody gets to tell me to remove them.  \n\nMy husband is my end game and I wouldn't want anyone else if that changed, far too old and set in my ways.  But looking at it and remembering how I felt at that time?  Nobody has the right to take that away from me.", "No.", "Nobody projects better than a cheater. My ex used to make me feel like I was a big giant floozy and definitely fucking all his friends. Turns out he was fucking *my* best friend (also our roommate).", "Did we have the same ex? Mine did that too. Chays left open on phone and computer for me to see if I walked past. Then I was made to feel bad about what he was doing!", "Or you know you could marry someone you trust.", "You want us to believe that his phone doesn\u2019t idle out be honest here. You opened it", "His phone was not open to his exs messages on the night stand. You went looking. At least be honest.", "If thats your point than its ok. \n\nBut than you cant be together with someone who dont want to be remembered to your ex and your time together every time he looks at you.", "If its not about the tattoo, what are you talking about?", "It has nothing to do with trust. It has to do with having no secrets. I have the best relationship with my spouse out of anyone I know and we\u2019ve been together 12 years. There is absolutely nothing I don\u2019t know and she doesn\u2019t know. But if you want a glorified sex roommate go on ahead.", "so nice how naive you are...", "Well firstly, I'd never be stupid enough to tell them.   And with all over, very busy coverage on both arms, hands, legs, feet, and back then good luck finding it.  \n\nBut mostly, I'd only date an adult who can accept a past and presumably has their own.", "We are talking about the tattoo.

I think the tattoo is the least of her problems, tbh, and it won't be solved my removing or covering the tat.", "If its past, why you wouldn\u2019t remove it?\n\nDo you still have every gift or stuff as memory from other relationships?", "This!", "So you think this tattoo dont have the same meaning as a ring?", "I've very clearly explained how I feel about my tattoos, they represent snapshots of my life, and my husband has been a massive part of that so why would I erase him.  Should I remove the one I got with my mum because she's since died?  \n\nI don't sit there staring at them, but occasionally I reminisce and smile at important ones\n\nMy past formed me and made me who I am, without previous relationships I wouldn't have met my husband.  He's the only relationship tattoo I've got, but after 10 years of my life he certainly earned his place to always be remembered fondly if it all ended.", "Correct."]}
