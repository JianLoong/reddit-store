Not for any moral reason, I just want to focus on uni without extra complications and I\u2019d rather my first be with someone I care about and feel completely comfortable with. Guys get weird about it when sex comes up. Either they fetishize it, turn it into a challenge, or lose interest. The guys that get all excited about a \u201c0 bodycount\u201d are the woooorst and it\u2019s my #1 dating pet peeve.\n\nThere is a guy we\u2019ll call Bob that hangs around my friend group because he\u2019s one of the other guy\u2019s roommate. Bob has good moments, but he acts like a major douche-canoe when dating or sex comes up. Brags about sleeping with a lot of girls, but also looks down on them for being loose. I try to avoid Bob.\n\n Anyway, Bob asked me out before Thanksgiving break. Like two days before that, I heard him talking to one of the guys about a  girl he went on a date with and he said he hit it and quit it because he doesn\u2019t date sluts. So when Bob asked me out, I said no thanks. He pressed for a reason and I told him that I heard him talk about all his hookups and I don\u2019t date sluts. You should have seen the look on his face. He said it wasn\u2019t really that many and he was exaggerating a little, I\u2019m \u201cwife material\u201d so he\u2019s not looking to hookup. I said if his body count was over 0 he was too easy to be husband material.\n\nBob lost his shit about it and the friend group is split. Some think it\u2019s hilarious and Bob got a taste of his own medicine, others think it was wrong to slut-shame him even if he is kind of a bellend.", "created_utc": 1701103479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1857ar7/aita_for_slutshaming_a_slutshamer/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sick of the double standard so to see it weaponised in reverse was fun. Don't let the comments get to you, but also maybe don't make a habit of slutshaming dudes either, as honestly the stigma around having multiple sexual partners needs to go, full stop, both directions.

NTA.\n\nA guy once told me about a first date he had with a woman. He liked her a lot, thought they had great chemistry, and the date ended in sex. He called her for a second date and she ignored him. He didn't understand why. \n\nI explained that, just like when men devalue a chick for giving it up on the first date, some women devalue men for doing the same. He was shocked, and laughed at how little he had ever considered that possibility.  \n\nLesson: don't look to the media to tell you about men, women and dating. Just like the fashion industry tries to push the ridiculous narrative that most men want to date coat hangers (cheaper for them to produce standardized clothes devoid of curves), the media wants to convince you that men and women have inherently different standards from each other when it comes to sex. \n\nThere are some men who don't care how many previous sexual partners their current partner has had, and some that do. Same goes for women. Sorry dudes, you won't always get a free pass when it comes to being loose.", "NTA that's funny as hell. If he can't take it he shouldn't dish it out.

He shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it.", "NTA and pretty hilarious. Red-pillers get their panties twisted about women's sexual partners, but frankly the data they cite about promiscuity predicting future divorce and such is more or less the same for both men and women. There isn't anything inherently wrong with wanting a partner who hasn't been with (many) other people, but if you can't actually live your own standard, you should probably shut up about it.", "NTA- And this is hilarious. You just called out the disgusting way he thinks of women. He probably would've been equally upset if you hadn't \"slut-shamed\" him, and instead commented on the way he talks about other women.

I totally get where you come from, but if that were me, I would feel like I compromised with my values by doing what I\u2019m so against myself. I agree with you that he is definitely in the wrong himself, but I just think this possibly could have been handled more adult like. You could have told him how disrespectful you think it is to talk about girls like he does and so on, and then if he still defends his actions call him out as being a hypocrite.
