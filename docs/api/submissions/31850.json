Not for any moral reason, I just want to focus on uni without extra complications and I\u2019d rather my first be with someone I care about and feel completely comfortable with.

Bob has good moments, but he acts like a major douche-canoe when dating or sex comes up. Brags about sleeping with a lot of girls, but also looks down on them for being loose. I try to avoid Bob.\n\n Anyway, Bob asked me out before Thanksgiving break. Like two days before that, I heard him talking to one of the guys about a  girl he went on a date with and he said he hit it and quit it because he doesn\u2019t date sluts. So when Bob asked me out, I said no thanks. He pressed for a reason and I told him that I heard him talk about all his hookups and I don\u2019t date sluts. You should have seen the look on his face. He said it wasn\u2019t really that many and he was exaggerating a little, I\u2019m \u201cwife material\u201d so he\u2019s not looking to hookup. I said if his body count was over 0 he was too easy to be husband material.\n\nBob lost his shit about it and the friend group is split. Some think it\u2019s hilarious and Bob got a taste of his own medicine, others think it was wrong to slut-shame him even if he is kind of a bellend.", "created_utc": 1701103479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1857ar7/aita_for_slutshaming_a_slutshamer/", "score": 5412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
