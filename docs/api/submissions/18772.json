{"id": 18772, "submission_id": "13y9ep7", "title": "AITA for quitting the choir because I didn't get the part I wanted?", "selftext": "I'm in a music group of about 50 people and we have a year end concert coming up in less than three weeks. Our conductor, we'll call her Lisa, makes the decisions about what we're performing etc, and most of us don't get a say.\n\nSo a couple of months ago she announced she was bringing it an several outside performers to do some solos. One of the solos is exactly in my range, it's my favourite piece, I've performed it before (not with this group), and it has cultural resonance for me. I was upset about not getting to perform it, obviously, but initially I thought I could live with it.\n\nOnly I can't. Every rehearsal I leave angry. I don't like who I'm being but I can't seem to make myself let it go. Some fellow members have agreed with me privately that an amateur group like us should showcase talent from within the group and that I should be the one performing it. This just makes me madder because I feel like Lisa is basically saying I'm not good enough.\n\nI know I can't make Lisa change plans, since she never really listens to anyone. But I'm not having fun with the group right now and I don't like myself when I'm angry. I decided to bow out of the rest of rehearsals and the concert just to avoid the situation since I was upset. But some people have said I'm just being childish about not getting the solo. I don't think I am because I'm just removing myself from a situation that's upsetting to me. The group is large enough that one person won't be missed. So AITA?\n\nETA because it came up in the comments: the soloists are a mix of professional and not. The one who is singing the soprano piece is a personal friend of Lisa, not a professional singer. We've had her sing with us before. I don't personally like her singing style but I usually just concentrate on my part.\n\nAlso the \"culture\" thing. I don't want to be too specific because of anonymity. But say you were casting Maria from West Side Story (not the piece we're doing). And you have a latina singer in the (mostly white) choir who can sing it. Instead you bring in someone who is not latina. It's not exactly wrong, but you might expect the latina singer to have strong feelings about that particular role, culturally speaking.", "created_utc": 1685703321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y9ep7/aita_for_quitting_the_choir_because_i_didnt_get/", "score": 962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is meant to be fun, and clearly you aren't having fun. It's not just about not getting the solo, the main issue here is that people have been brought in from outside to do the solos. That's not right.", "NTA.  If you're not enjoying being in choir anymore, regardless the reason, it's perfectly fine to leave (quit).  \n\nBefore doing so, however, ask yourself if you're quitting permanently.  Once you quit (especially if you give the reason for quitting), it seems highly unlikely that you will allowed to return.", "NAH. You don't have to stay in the group if it's no longer a fun experience for you. And Lisa isn't obligated to prioritize choir members for the solos. She wants to put on a professional level performance, so she's hiring professionals. It's nobody's fault, you just have different expectations. \n\nBefore I retired, I was a soloist in my church choir, and I was a little annoyed when our director brought in a soprano soloist for the Christmas and Easter concerts. But she was a professional, and even though I could have done it well, I couldn't have done it *that* well. \n\nIt sounds as if Lisa has a different expectation for the group than you and several other members. Who made her the director, and what was she told about those expectations? I think it would be worth having a discussion about the purpose of the group and whether it's operated primarily for the benefit of the members or primarily to put on a professional-sounding show for the audience.", "NTA - an amateur choir is recreational, and if you\u2019re not enjoying it or that culture isn\u2019t a good fit for you, it\u2019s completely fair to bow out. \n\nYour reasons are valid, and if there\u2019s no room for change I hope you can find one that suits you in your area. At least you know what to include in your enquiries next time.", "NTA I get where you are coming from. You aren\u2019t being \u201cstretched\u201d and it\u2019s hurting your enjoyment of the choir. To cap it off the conductor won\u2019t listen to input. \n\nI can empathise with this. I played in an orchestra which wasn\u2019t all that great but i hadn\u2019t played in a few years in woodwind and was a little rusty on the instrument(my music reading etc was still sharp as I was only rusty on this instrument i also play violin and piano) \n\nI thought it would be good to get back into the swing of things. Problem was that of all the players in my section barely read music and wouldn\u2019t get the notes right. I could but the conductor still wouldn\u2019t let me play with the 1st\u2019s he wanted a player for the 3rds and didn\u2019t care on ability. \n\nI left in the end for a better orchestra more at my ability level. \n\nIt sounds like your ability has moved beyond that of what your choir can/will offer you. It\u2019s time to find another choir.", "NTA.\nImo, a \u201cchildish\u201d reaction would be to lash out at the person who got the part, demand it be given to you, or to immediately storm off when you found out you didn\u2019t get it. That you tried to stick it out anyway indicates to me it isn\u2019t childish. At the end of the day you feel how you feel and you tried to work around it. Maybe calmly explain to Lisa why you are leaving. It\u2019s not wrong to feel upset about these things as long as you behave reasonably and it sounds like you did.", "NTA for leaving, in a 50+ choir I don\u2019t think it will hurt the harmonic.", "Nah but don't expect to be accepted back after the concert.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in a few choirs and you can generally tell within the first hour Exactly how competent and professional your choir leader is. \n\nDictating everything, refusing to listen to everyone and only listening to their personal favorites are Not signs of a good leader.\n\nA choir who sings song they like, instead of what they are ordered, will Always sing with more passion and generally sound better.\n\nAnd your choir recital is to showcase The Choir, not some rando your \u2018leader\u2019 decides you are now backing singers for. \n\nYou look for talent Within the choir first.", "maybe find another choir group that gives people who join opportunities and then tell lisa that you are joining a new choir because you would like the option to do solos and since you dont see any opportunities presenting themselves here", "I\u2019m a former choir person, and my director had a very obvious habit of showing favoritism to certain people. It was frustrating. I completely understand why you quit and I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong.\nINFO: Does you leaving negatively impact the rest of the choir in a major way? Are there enough people on your voice part that they can still do the concert with no major adjustments? \nSo long as you\u2019re not screwing over the rest of the choir, I\u2019m gonna go with NTA.", "NAH. It is a little childish you\u2019re leaving the group because you didn\u2019t get a solo.

A voluntary thing like an amateur choir should be fun or it's no fun.   \n\n\nI wouldn't burn bridges with a big dramatic exit.

It's not rage quitting because you haven't burned any bridges here, you've left it open for you to return once she's done picking favourites.\n\nBringing in another amateur to sing solo, an amateur who has no cultural connection to the piece, without even bothering to see if anyone within the group could sing that part means she's not using what she has available to the best of the group's abilities, or for their benefit, nor is there any incentive to improve as a group.", "NTA - you\u2019re line about removing yourself from a situation that is upsetting you is key here. Also that the group is large enough that you won\u2019t be missed. If it is an amateur group where you go to find joy and you\u2019re not enjoying it, no reason to continue if you\u2019re not letting folks down on a commitment you made. Find something else to fill your time that does spark joy. Good luck!", "I've had similar experiences and know exactly how you feel. Childish or not, it can steal your joy of singing.", "NTA\n\nLisa made it clear she doesn't actually care about any of you. You owe her nothing.", "NTA. It sounds like Lisa didn\u2019t even give you (or other choir members) the opportunity to audition for a solo. That\u2019s a recipe for trouble. \n\nI would definitely consider whether this is a group you want to sing with long term, and if it is, maybe stick it out and speak with Lisa if an opportunity arises. Not \u2018I should have gotten this solo\u2019 but \u2018I think existing choir members should have the opportunity to audition before we bring in other people\u2019. But you\u2019ll also have to accept that she might not go for that, and that at the end of the day it\u2019s her call. \n\nI absolutely get being angry about it. I was so pissed off at losing out on a solo once that I photoshopped the other girl out of the pics of the show because I couldn\u2019t stand looking at her  (if she\u2019d been good, that would be one thing - I lose all the time to good people. But she was shit, just very pretty while being shit).", "Your attitude makes YTA. I've directed choirs before and been in several. On a trip to Ireland one of our members had a solo and she worked hard. At rehearsal the director gave the solo to another member's daughter who was visiting but not a choir member. It sucked. The replacement was a professional but our choir was audition only and many of us were musicians. \n\nI understand your frustration but dwelling on it will put tension in your voice every time you sing that piece.", "I mean it was all decided before you got the song. Can you ask Lisa that in the future solos be opened to the group before outsiders.", "NTA - you're in the group to have fun and the leader takes the fun out of it. Go find a group you like.\n\nINFO: have you told Lisa your displeasure with her choices over time?", "NAH. I've been the not picked musician and I've been the conductor/director. Someone's feelings always get hurt when solo time comes around and as the director, she doesn't lead by public opinion. You're allowed to be angry about it but you're not the director so it is what it is. Leave if it's creating that much resentment but know it's a common occurrence in the musical world so it'll happen again at some point.", "NTA. If the group isn't reliant on your participation, then you have no obligation to continue attending something that makes you unhappy. It is hard when something we love becomes \"poisoned\" for us. I hope you find another singing outlet!", "INFO: did you actually tell Lisa beforehand that you wanted the solo? Or at least that you would be interested in auditioning for it?", "NAH neither one of you is obligated to make decisions to benefit the other at your own cost.

If it's no longer fun and you're finding it upsetting, there's no point in continuing.  Take a break for a while.", "NAH. Director can ask who she wants and you can leave out.

Quitting will reflect poorly on you and break people's trust that they can count on you to do your part in a group.", "Ooo this gives off major first soprano energy. And I\u2019m a first soprano with a degree in music performance just for reference. Idk babe, I get where you\u2019re coming from. But I think quitting is a big step. You\u2019ll be burning a bridge there. So you need to ask yourself if that\u2019s worth it. Have you been given solos before?

I also want to add how this might affect your future. You say this particular solo is very much about your culture, and you\u2019ve even had other members ask why you aren\u2019t singing this part? \n\nThe people in your audience and judges (not sure if they\u2019re are any sorry) are also going to think that exactly same thing. Why wasn\u2019t the clearly same cultured girl doing this song? And they are all going to assume it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t good enough", "NTA brings to mind my cliquey high school choir director who favored the popular kids.", "NTA. You were in a situation that made you upset, but you also realized that it was beyond your control. So rather than complain, you removed yourself from the situation. I see nothing wrong with that regardless of why you were upset.", "YTA\n\nGetting all uspet and quitting because you didn't get chosen is childish.", ">But some people have said I'm just being childish about not getting the solo\n\nBut....you ARE being childish about it. You didn't get what you wanted and now you're so jealous and upset that you're taking your toys (in this case your voice) and going home because you aren't getting your way. \n\nYour anger is actually jealousy. You WANTED the part but someone else got it. Apparently this was decided before you even KNEW about he solo or the song choice so it's not like you ever had a chance at it to begin with.\n\nPart of being in a group is realizing that you aren't always going to get what you want. Acting like a petulant child and leaving over it makes you look incredibly immature and not in any way capable of being part of a group. \n\nYTA", "I realize this is a close call but I'm going with NTA. Sometimes it really is that hard to shake strong emotion, and if the stakes aren't high enough to work through it...", "INFO - Is the choir negatively affected by you leaving?", "YTA. Your choir director has creative license and makes the calls. Same when you play in a symphony... Not everyone gets a solo. You're part of a group working together.", "YTA. You\u2019ve done nothing but build resentment instead of tackling the problem head on. \n\nYou haven\u2019t even asked if you could have the solo. If you (and others) had a problem with it, you\u2019ve had ample opportunity to talk to Lisa calmly and try to sort the situation out. \n\nAlso, if you or none of the others are good enough then that\u2019s something you will have to come to terms with. You\u2019re not entitled to a solo because it means something to you. Sometimes, you just aren\u2019t good enough for things and that\u2019s ok. \n\nI think you\u2019re scared of rejection if you were to confront Lisa and so you\u2019ve decided to run instead.", "NTA, just make sure it\u2019s something you actually want to quit permanently. In college I had some low points and burned bridges I shouldn\u2019t have way too quickly. I know the director doesn\u2019t seem to be someone you want contact with, but what about friends you\u2019ve made? Maybe you can stay in touch?", "YTA\n\nClearly lots of people commenting here who have never sung in a choir.\n\nYour director prefers to get external soloists of a higher calibre than the choir members. The fact she is a friend is neither here nor there - the director prefers higher quality soloists than she can find in the choir. The soloist you mention may be a semi-pro rather than a full-time pro but the are probably very good. It is also the decision of the director and I don't understand why you think you should have a say. Choirs are not a democracy, the director gets to make artistic decisions. \n\nHowever, if you really want a solo you need to ask for it, the director can't read minds. If you'd said something after the first rehearsal, she might have considered it. The cultural thing sounds like a red herring too - I certainly wouldn't assume ethnicity would or should play a part, in fact it might be a deeply problematic way to assign solos.\n\nAs it is, you've had little tantrums and complained to your fellow choristers, and stormed off because you didn't get a solo you never asked for. I've met plenty of people like you in choirs and I avoid any choirs that indulge that kind of behaviour.\n\nGood riddance for the choir!", "YTA for how you handled it.\n\nYou left your group just weeks from a concert over something you didn't even try to resolve. Instead of being an adult and actually talking to her, you quit when your people needed you.\n\nIf you had pulled her aside and spoke about it at any point after finding out, it would be different. But you didn't even try.", "I think part of being in the arts it's getting rejected, and understanding that maybe you're good enough, but you are not what the director wants.\n\nIf you can't deal with that maybe you are not prepared for that environment.\n\nNTA for quitting, but you should analize why it affected you so much that you stopped enjoying it.", "YTA, 100%.\n\nYou are dropping out of an entire concert because you are angry about one piece. One piece that the director introduced from the beginning as being a solo piece for an outside performer, that was never offered to you and was always intended for that performer.\n\nSolo singing is very different from choral singing. It is not unusual in the slightest to have professional or experienced soloists join a choir for solo parts for many reasons. Voices that are GREAT as part of a group sometimes aren't as great on their own. People who are GREAT as part of a group sometimes aren't as great on their own. In a choir you have other people singing your part to help blend any harsh edges to your voice, to cover any missteps in tone or timing, and to provide lots of visual options to cover for any awkward stage presence. For bigger pieces or parts I would not expect a choir director to be comfortable assigning a solo piece to someone they don't know the be an experienced solo performer. She trusts her friend to be able to pull this off and make the group look good. She did not trust an choir member to do the same. This is hardly unusual and not a personal slight to you.\n\nPart of being a choir member is lending your voice as a small part of a much larger whole. You are declining to do that if you can't also have your voice showcased. This to me is horribly self-centered. So I think you're not TA for dropping out, because you shouldn't make yourself miserable over a volunteer activity. But definitely YTA for being so self-centered that you can't see past your own nose on this one.", "YTA essentially what it goes down to is that you didn't get the part you wanted and now you're leaving in a childish tantrum of course you're the AH. You can try to justify it in your own mind as much as you want but it doesn't change the fact that you've bailed on the group, with the limited time for them to replace you and you are just being an ass.", "YTA people without talent get roles over talented people ALL THE TIME (same from ethnicity to looks) deal with it- not getting the role you wanted is not the end of your life\n\nYours, a classically trained actress", "ESH. Lisa is sorta acting like the boss because that\u2019s the authority the group has given her. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re Ah for deciding to move on but a little AH for quitting right now.

You're not going to be offered solo roles if people believe you're going to flake out less than a month before you go live.", "NTA in that you are allowed to do what you want.

Sometimes, but not all the time. I find it disconcerting that the director is bringing in outside people when she has 50 people to choose from. Unless she's friends with a Pavoratti. Really, not one of the 50 could do a solo? You tailor your concerts to your chorale talent. I would be surprised if more people don't leave. You may or may not be solo material, but one of the other 49 has to be.", "YTA, definitely racist and also unprofessional.\n\nSo now only certain ethnicities can perform some roles?

If you aren't having fun, definitely leave, but it sounds like you are only not having fun bc you didn't get the solo. If another person in the choir who the sing isn't culturally relevant to had gotten it, would you still be feeling this way?

It sounds like Lisa is making the \u201cshowcase\u201d all about her and not the choir. The point of a showcase like this is to showcase the talent within the choir not outside talent. In my personal opinion, Lisa should be removed and replaced.", "NTA.  You're allowed to have feelings.  They are valid.  This is the the kind of thing that happens all of the time in life, you either can get over it or you can't.  Then you either stay or go.  Probably time to put singing on the back burner and explore some other hobbies.", "NTA I had a similar situation with a choir I was in about 20 years ago.  We did a local competition and won a spot to compete nationally.  When we went to the national competition our conductor brought in singers from her other choir.  I was pissed.  Our church choir won this spot because we were good and now she\u2019s brought in more talent like we weren\u2019t good enough.  I only wish I had enough courage to say something and walk away.  It took me 5 years of her doing this before I walked away.", "I don\u2019t think your wrong here. You normally don\u2019t get a say in your part or pieces but what doesn\u2019t sit right is that it\u2019s a friend of the conductor. This is a huge conflict of interest and feels like she is pushing people who are dedicated to the group aside for her buddy to have the spotlight. \n\nThe thing I would have done differently would to have to been call a meeting with the entire choir to express your concerns. Say it doesn\u2019t have to be you but it should be someone dedicated to the choir. Concerts are what you work for all season and to have someone outside swoop in and disrupt that is not cool. \n\nBut at the end of the day you felt icky about it so you removed yourself. That is perfectly reasonable. And yeah as a white lady if there was an opportunity to have a Latina sing Maria I would also be upset.

Our conductor, we'll call her Lisa, makes the decisions about what we're performing etc, and most of us don't get a say.\n\nSo a couple of months ago she announced she was bringing it an several outside performers to do some solos. One of the solos is exactly in my range, it's my favourite piece, I've performed it before (not with this group), and it has cultural resonance for me. I was upset about not getting to perform it, obviously, but initially I thought I could live with it.\n\nOnly I can't. Every rehearsal I leave angry. I don't like who I'm being but I can't seem to make myself let it go. Some fellow members have agreed with me privately that an amateur group like us should showcase talent from within the group and that I should be the one performing it. This just makes me madder because I feel like Lisa is basically saying I'm not good enough.\n\nI know I can't make Lisa change plans, since she never really listens to anyone. But I'm not having fun with the group right now and I don't like myself when I'm angry. I decided to bow out of the rest of rehearsals and the concert just to avoid the situation since I was upset. But some people have said I'm just being childish about not getting the solo. I don't think I am because I'm just removing myself from a situation that's upsetting to me. The group is large enough that one person won't be missed. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: Does you plan on rejoining next season/year?", "My questions are regarding the structure of the group.  How did Lisa get total control of the group to be able to choose the concert theme and bring in outsiders with no over site by the group? Is there no democratic way to select what is performed?  Why do most of you have no say, and by extrapolation, who does have some say over the way the group is run? Could more of the decisions Lisa makes be made by group vote instead of one single person?  Does your group have any type of bylaws or rules that could determine if outsiders are not brought in unless there is no one in the group who can perform the part? Is the group about amateurs sharing their gifts, or is it about being a semiprofessional group using outside talent to bolster the basic group?  Can the group either take some of the decision making power from Lisa or manage without her if she left the group? Is it worth reviewing the group dynamics or is it not worth the possible havoc? The answer to these questions could shape the group going forward.", "NTA I understand you completely because I had the same experience just with marching band. I was assistant drum major for two years going for drum major when the director gave it to the new girl because her mom was a teacher. You are not TA, if something isn't fun don't be like me and stick around. Quit and do something that is fun for you :).", "NAH. You can do whatever is best for you, and in this situation it does seem that removing yourself is a good move because you won\u2019t be taking your feelings out on anyone else and can stop putting yourself in an upsetting situation. The choir isn\u2019t obligated to give you a solo and nobody\u2019s saying you aren\u2019t good enough, so i wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re wrong for not giving you that solo, but you have every right to have feelings and to be mature in removing yourself from the situation rather than making a big fuss about it.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to quit if it\u2019s no longer an enjoyable experience for you. Sounds like she\u2019s picking favorites with her friends and giving them favorable positions because of nepotism and not skill.", "NTA, If you're not happy then what's the point?", "NTA. You can never be TA for removing yourself from a situation that's making you uncomfortable.", "NTA. What's the point of belonging to a performing group if the leader brings in other performers who don't belong? I do think you should consider a group leave though, as it sounds like other members are fed up too. Or some sort of group petition to get a new conductor.", "NAH, but I\u2019d talk to your director and ask if you could audition for the part. Explain what you\u2019ve told us and ask for a chance. I\u2019d you don\u2019t get it, nothing wrong with quitting something that makes you unhappy.", "NTA. \n\nIn an amateur group, or even a professional group (like community theatre) you choose people inside the company first, and that is why people participate. You should only be bringing outsiders in to fill open spots. \n\nWhat's the point of being in a repeating group if an outsider can come in at any time and get the good stuff? If this was some big money making situation, then sure, but this seems like it supposed to be a group mostly for fun and community. Plus, it isn't an outsider, it is a personal friend of the decision maker. \n\nI was ready to call you an AH, because we all know that part of the arts is facing rejection and dealing with it, but this doesn't sound fair, and it certainly doesn't sounds fun.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to bring this up, I think the right thing to do would be wait until the very early planning stages for your next concert (like, as soon as you know a next concert will exist really, before pieces are picked) and then have a conversation with Lisa about how you/the group would really love if you could have soloists from within the group. That way it's forward planning, not bitterness.", "Title is misleading, its not just that you're quitting because you didn't get a part- imo that would be an overreaction and an AH move depending on your relationship to the group. But this sounds like the musical director is blatantly parachuting in her faves. I've been in musical societies where the actual members end up playing chorus to semi pros. Sometimes you need it when there's a professional shaped hole in the principal cast that needs a safe pair of hands to not fuck up. \n\nUltimately, NTA, you need to do you, and walking away is a healthy decision but it's less about the solo and more about the entire direction of the group.", "NAH - The conductor should make those decisions, if you don't like them then you are free to leave. You are under no obligation to stay and she is under no obligation to give you the solo. I do think you are being a little childish because you couldn't let it go, but find a choir where you are happier.", "NTA You are not having fun. You gave it a fair shot. You tried to work with the dynamic. You are still not having fun. You can stop writing. You can stop justifying it. You can just move on and hopefully find a group that does make you happy.", "NTA. I had a similar experience with this woman who was a curator. I thought I was the only one who she rubbed the wrong way with her imperiousness. I stopped sending things in for her shows. Lo and behold next thing I saw she got fired. I later found out she was deeply irritating a lot of people by playing favorites and acting so untouchable. Everybody has a boss\u2026. I am sure this will end poorly for her", "NTA - if you\u2019re not happy you have a right to leave", "I  was in band and theater in school.  YTA for being upset you didn't get the part you wanted.  You do not have to stay.  But, if you are only going to stay in groups  that you can get your way.  Do not join any more groups.  You cannot always dictate what part you get to do.  It is a group not a solo effort.  If you cannot be part of a team, groups are not for you.", "Exactly! She started a group invited people to have fun and then brought in outside people because the people who joined in good faith to enjoy a hobby together aren't good enough for her. If it was a swimming team and the coach brought in people from another team for the actual competition it would be so weird but this is the same.", "Yeah I sang in elite, multi-round audition to get in choirs from age 7 til my early 20s. I\u2019ve never seen an outside professional soloist brought in for an amateur concert when the parts could be done by the members themselves. \n\nWe had alumni soloists every once in a blue moon but this seems weird to me.", "Have... have none of you been part of a choir? This is super common. Not everyone who is in a choir would make a great soloist.", "That's part of why I didn't want to bring up my actual reason for quitting with Lisa. I know it sounds like I just pouted and didn't tell her I was upset. But the soloist was booked before I knew anything about it, before the group was even told we were performing the piece. It was already too late to ask. \nAnd if I tell her I'm skipping the concert because I'm upset, it might just mean I can't come back and I do normally enjoy the group. If I just say, sorry, something personal and urgent came up, then it becomes acceptable.\nWe've had soloists before, and it's never been an issue. It's just this particular piece has cultural resonance for me and the soloist is not from my culture.", "The soloist isn't a professional, she's a personal friend of Lisa", "Yes I feel this. Lisa has said previously how she likes having a couple confident sopranos singing 2nd because the melody part (1st) is easier. So because I'm good at harmony, I always get that middle part. Which is fine because it's about the group.", "I had a similar situation with my orchestra. I played with them from a few years after beginning at like 14/15 till i was 22/23ish. (26 now) In all those 7-8 years i was only ever allowed to play the second flute. Maybe the Oboe part (since we didnt have an actual Oboe) if i was lucky. The first flute was better than me, but there were TONS of pieces where i would have been easily able to handle the part. It just became frustrating a lot to always get pushed to second flute by the conductor. Meanwhile i got to watch one of my besties on the trumpet (same age, same playing time) got pushed for first part even though there were enough being able to play it and her often not even wanting to. She got pushed to get better and play the tougher parts while i had the opposite experience. This is part of the reason it stoped being fun for me and why i eventually quit.", "This was my thought. OP isn't an asshole but they may have burn a bridge.", "There are more 2nd soprano than 1st. And there are always more than enough sopranos in most choirs. \n\nIf a tenor quits, that's a major drama. But a soprano? Meh. I doubt it will make an ounce of difference, especially since everyone pretty well knows their parts by now.", "Honestly even if she was screwing the rest of the choir over I don't think she would be in the wrong. If Lisa wants to bring her friends in for the solos then she cannot reasonably expect the people who actually contribute to the group at large to stick around.", "That is a really big leap.", "I didn't know we were performing this piece until she announced the soloist. Had I known, I definitely would have asked to sing it. Then we could have had a discussion about whether I'm good enough or not. But to bring it up now I feel would be like sour grapes.", "Yep. If it's the end of year, she should bow out afterward. She could explain why, then. Or she could go to the director now and explain she was hurt because she wasn't given the opportunity. At this point the director has done nothing wrong because she is oblivious of the situation and unaware of the resentment OP is harboring. I'm curious about OPs age. I think there will always be situations like this, and we need to learn to navigate them rather than getting butt hurt.", "In a professional setting perhaps. But in a community group?\n\nSo I'm in another group where I play an instrument that doesn't usually get solos (think Tuba or Bassoon). The director tries to choose a mix of pieces every year that showcases different members of the group, unless you've specifically indicated you'd rather not. So last concert we had a piece with a woodwind feature, another with a trombone solo, and so on.\n\nI think part of the enjoyment for some people is getting that little spotlight once in a while. It's not every concert. But there's a sense of fair play. And we rarely get outside soloists unless it's a youth (in which case I fully support because kids in the arts need a space to try performing with a group)", "A couple of people actually approached me about it, not the other way around. As in: \"why aren't you performing this?\"", "It\u2019s similar to the swim team analogy but actually worse IMO lol\u2026at least you could rationalize that the swim team has the goal of winning something and bringing in better swimmers could clearly further that goal. Still a weak and shitty move, yet still more reasonable than bringing in supposedly better singers (something that\u2019s far more subjective than competitive swimming) so you can hypothetically sound better when the point is for everyone to have fun and\u2026sing\u2026", "I haven't read all the comments, but did we get all that back story?  Did Lisa start the choir?  Its also not the same as a swimming team.  They are competing against other swim teams and that would give them an unfair advantage.  As far as I could tell, this was a just a concert.  Did I miss that this was a choir competition?", "Loads of amateur music groups will bring in professionals as soloists/leaders to help give sections a boost. It's a pretty common thing.", "Once you get beyond that into professional choirs, this is absolutely the done thing. You have the choir and they bring in soloists.", "Really? I\u2019ve been in many amateur choirs and bringing in pro soloists has been the norm. It\u2019s just the way some choirs are run.", "I know elite amateur choirs and unauditioned community  choirs that performed unpaid with professional soloists and orchestras who are paid. It's totally the norm.", "Yeah, this seems really normal to me and my experience of choirs.", "This is the correct way to play this.", "This seems like the best approach in the short term. Then you can take some time to think about whether Lisa\u2019s leadership style is going to create more issues for you. She sounds pretty self-centered and unaware to me, at least using this as an example. Your free time is valuable and your hobbies should maximize your joy.", "NTA, she just wants her friend to sing. Hobbys should give joy and not frustration. Find a group you have fun with.", "You might want to edit your post to add this as I think it makes quite a difference. It sound like blatant favouritism. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nOkay. NOPE. Now I see this and I\u2019m angry. Before I understood, but didn\u2019t have both sides.\n\nCan you get rid of Lisa???", "2nd soprano, say no more. Personally I think you did nothing wrong.", "Lisa brought in a ringer without even asking if anyone in the choir wanted to sing those parts themselves. That's a move that screams indifference to your members.", "nnnnmm?m", "Exactly. Giving up and running from the problem solves nothing. Can't resolve something if you don't even try.", "Why would it being amateur mean you should get the role you want?", "People always say these things. It's part of being in a group. If you don't like it, leave.", "Maybe you aren\u2019t the only one dissatisfied with the way the director is choosing her favorites.", "I'm not sure, but I think she started it. She's definitely been the leader for many years, since long before I joined. It's a community choir, mostly adults, and we don't compete. We pay to participate. We put on a couple of shows a year and give profits from ticket sales to local charities.", "I assumed Lisa started it but she's in charge so same thing. Competition/display/presentation/show swap whatever word you like and it's the same sentiment.", "Seems so sad", "Note I said \u201camateur performance.\u201d", "Yeah I\u2019m not too schooled on how amateur choirs work or on the culture around them but it seems super weird to me that this one lady is everyone\u2019s boss when they\u2019re all adults who are apparently doing it for the simple joy of doing it. Then she brings pros and her friend to do the funnest parts? Seems like some weird power trip to me.", "Just because she's a friend of Lisa doesn't mean she can't be better singer. People who are good at same hobby are often friends", "Being an amateur group means solos should go to members of the group not outsiders be they hired professionals or, in the case of this solo, the director buddy", "Are the guest soloists also paying to participate?\n\nEdit: grammar", "Thank you for that context OP.  Also, that is really awesome that you raise money and give it to charity!", "She\u2019s let the power go to her head. I\u2019m sure she makes you all think she started it. Is it held at a community center? If so she\u2019s a city employee and you are paying fees to the city most likely. See what the actual structure is", "Its not the same thing.  Lisa could have been voted in and the group may, as a whole, support her.  It is no unheard of to bring in soloists for choirs.  I was in a university level chorus that did the exact same thing.", "You're right, I meant more adult choirs.", "Yea but there is a difference between \"friends who have the same interests and perform togeather\" and \"group leader brings in friends from outside the group for special opportunities thus actively denying those opportunities to the others in the group\".", "Nepotism in the choir isn\u2019t a great look regardless", "This response is tone deaf.\n\nPun intended.", "This is the hard part. How do we know which one it is? OP is clearly upset and could possibly be making it seem more like nepotism than it is.", "It's an amateur group, the solo's should go to the members of the group. At minimum they at least should get the chance to audition. High level and competitive choirs bringing in professional or guest soloists is the norm- but this is not that.", "If she was just having the same hobby she'd already be a member. But she isn't.", "This still doesn\u2019t touch on my initial comment. We don\u2019t know the real relationship and I don\u2019t think OP has an answer as to if they have a best friend relationship or if they have a good working relationship.", "The soloist could be a \u201cprofessional\u201d performer for all we know. They having the same hobbies doesn\u2019t mean they have to be apart of the same singing group. All I\u2019m saying is we literally don\u2019t know", "I don't think it matters, it's an amateur group. Solo's should be an opportunity for the people in the group to show off their skills, not for the group to play backup to the directors networking or nepotism."]}
