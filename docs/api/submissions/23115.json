When we split up, we both remarried. I remarried my current wife, and we have a daughter and a son. She remarried as well, and she had two sons. However, she ended up divorcing her husband and remarrying again and having another kid. So we'll call her second husband Carl and her current husband Dan.\n\nNow here's the problem. Carl is my ex-wife's ex-husband. He is not related to my son. He's just Albert's former (emphasis on former) stepfather. Carl really wants to maintain a relationship with Albert, but apparently my ex told him to kick rocks and that the only kids he is entitled to see are his biological ones.\n\nCarl eventually decided that since he wasn't making headway with my ex, that he would go through me. I shut that down. I hardly know Carl, and what little I do know of him irritates me. He told me he bonded with Albert and doesn't want him to have abandonment issues. I talked to Albert. He feels no abandonment issues and when I asked him if he missed Carl, he said no.\n\nCarl said I am an insensitive asshole. He asked me how I would feel if I was told I could never see one of my kids again. I said Albert isn't one of his kids, so stay away from him and leave me the fuck alone. My wife said I was a little intense with my statement, and she kind of understands where Carl is coming from, because if we were ever to (God forbid) split up, she would miss Albert too.\n\nI don't see how that is my problem. My ex is the one who married him, not me. He needs to talk to her. Apparently Dan hates Carl and that's why Carl can't see Albert, but why is that my issue? I feel no obligation to this man.

Instead, he wants to include him and is taking shit for it. Wtf.", "NTA. Neither you, your ex, nor Albert want Carl in his life.

Goodbye, Carl.", "NTA. Your ex\u2019s ex is thinking it\u2019s your responsibility to carry the torch for him?  Total nonsense. You are correct you have no obligation to him and are wise to shut down any claims to the contrary.

As you note there is no legal or biological reason for this and more important (thought not determinative) Albert does not want this.  Carl can be mad, but that's between him and your ex and we can see how that worked out.  Block him.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA, but I can understand where Carl is coming from. He *isn\u2019t* your problem, and Albert saying he doesn\u2019t miss him pushed it from N A H to NTA. But a child and (good, involved) step-parent make a bond in the years between toddler and double digits. 7 years is enough for a step-parent to form a parent-like bond to/with a child, and having that cut off would be very painful for them. I\u2019m curious about how Carl was as a step-father. Was he a good parental figure to your son? Why does Dan get the say on whether Carl sees Albert when he isn\u2019t Albert\u2019s father either?\n\nUltimately though, Albert\u2019s decision is the one that matters here, and he\u2019s made his choice. You could have been a bit kinder about Carl\u2019s position though.", "NTA. The most important person to consider is Albert. You were right to give Albert some say on the matter. Good for you for saying no! Carl was wrong to try to go to you over this. You handled it well.", "NTA. Could you have delivered some of your responses with less anger, totally. Doesn't make the content of that message any less sound. \n\nYou verified with your ex (and his ex) about her intents to include Carl. She says no \n\nYou verified with your son, he said no.\n\nNew step-dad (lots of dads going on here btw) Dan is a friction point with Carl.\n\nSo sounds like a big nope party for Carl. At this point his conduct is actually a little bit creepy. I wish him the best but it's not you or your families problem. And 100% agree, your ex wife needs to take this over. It's not your issue to manage.", "NTA if your son cared to stay in contact it would be a different story. He is his siblings father so it wouldn't be unheard of.", "NTA. If he's developed an attachment that sucks, but... it's not his kid. Sure if you broke up your wife would 'miss' Albert, but the very fact she misses him kind of asserts she would respect your wishes and not relentlessly try to go around the wishes of his biological parents TO see him.\n\nI feel bad for Carl, sure, but Carl needs to suck it up. He asked the parents. The parents made their feelings clear. End of discussion.\n\nAs for the 'intensity', I cant begrudge you for it. Dads are protective by nature, especially when it comes to grown adult men insisting they be allowed to see your son, and taking sketchy routes to make that happen.", "NtA. \n\nYour kid said no, so that's the end of it.", "NTA because you asked your kid. Had you just decided without listening to the kid you would have been an ass, but you did right.", "NTA.\n\nSucks if he feels attached to your son, but your son doesn't feel the same way and that's what is important. You would be an AH if your son still wanted contact... but you've asked him and he said he's not that attached to Albert.\n\nYou and your ex-wife are both allowed to tell him to screw off. Sometimes you get attached to someone, they don't feel the same way, and you just have to deal with that in life. Carl may be attached, Albert isn't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
