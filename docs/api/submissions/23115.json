Carl is my ex-wife's ex-husband. He is not related to my son. He's just Albert's former (emphasis on former) stepfather.

I shut that down. I hardly know Carl, and what little I do know of him irritates me. He told me he bonded with Albert and doesn't want him to have abandonment issues. I talked to Albert. He feels no abandonment issues and when I asked him if he missed Carl, he said no.\n\nCarl said I am an insensitive asshole. He asked me how I would feel if I was told I could never see one of my kids again. I said Albert isn't one of his kids, so stay away from him and leave me the fuck alone. My wife said I was a little intense with my statement, and she kind of understands where Carl is coming from, because if we were ever to (God forbid) split up, she would miss Albert too.\n\nI don't see how that is my problem. My ex is the one who married him, not me. He needs to talk to her. Apparently Dan hates Carl and that's why Carl can't see Albert, but why is that my issue? I feel no obligation to this man.

He asked the parents. The parents made their feelings clear. End of discussion.\n\nAs for the 'intensity', I cant begrudge you for it.

Not assuming OP is a deadbeat, as it doesn\u2019t appear that way to me at all.  My point is, 4-12, that is a big timeframe emotionally and kids do grow attached.

But odds are the kid is very aware of the guy and doesn't want to deal with him.", "No, he should have 0 rights and visitation with this child. Mom told him to kick rocks. OP told him no. Kid says he has no desire to continue that relationship. This man  Carl went around mom to try to get time with the kid. Completely inappropriate and disrespectful. He\u2019s definitely an asshole with no boundaries or respect for mom.", "I would love to hear how people propose that the son hang out with Carl at this point. Like under what circumstances? is someone going to babysit him while Carls around or something? Sounds like Carl needs to get a life of his own and move on", "5.5 years until she\u2019s 18. My daughter and I have definitely spoken about this same thing. I honestly dream of finally taking her to Paris (her dad made me cancel the trip for october 2021 bc COVID, I ended up taking just ny daughter the following year) and having our girls time again. It\u2019s sad bc I know how abusive her dad (44) can be to her and I was a buffer to it when I lived there. Now a 27 year old who is in search of a green card is her step mom in waiting, and I doubt she stands up for her. At first I let her come over even though it was painful for me, because I felt she deserved to see how a normal household runs (not screaming at kids to fuck off bc they don\u2019t like dinner, etc) but now I can\u2019t even do that. So I am patiently waiting for 18. My daughter will write her, and I can finally show her the peaceful home again.", "My mind immediately goes to the worst possible reasons.", "One can only have suspicions.", " \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "> Ah. I imagined he was like 4. Yeah Carl can fuck off.\n\nIf he was 4, the father should then decide for his son. And I don't see why on earth any father would bend over backwards so his ex's ex can continue to have a relationship with his son. Especially when his ex (the kid's mom) herself said \"no\".", "> I imagine her sons at 14 wouldn't have been comfortable asking to see their dad.\n\nBut that's not even their dad!", "I agree.  We are only going by the words of OP.\n\nWith Social Media today, most people can find one another when they are adults.\n\nIf it is important to the son, the son is very likely able to contact Carl , and know that Carl tried to continue contact.", "Eww I wouldn\u2019t want some weirdo of my ex talking to my son unsupervised. Major red flags as a mother", "If the son doesn't respond to Carl, then all of us would know that son does not  want to be in contact with Carl.\n\nIt is all very odd, and suspicious", "No. Absolutely not. This is a very silly take", "Bio mom would know their relationship best and she isn't on board with this at all which is immediately a red flag for me. \nIf she was okay with this maybe", "I would way prefer Carl get a little extra in terms of making sure Arthur knows he\u2019s loved than let his relationship go just because his ex isn\u2019t being communicative. OP could have delivered the sentiment better. At the end of the day he\u2019s mad at his ex for pushing her mess onto him, not Carl for being a little irritating but well meaning.", "Exactly. Anyone saying the child should have contact is completely ignoring all the facts laid out in front of them", "You sound like an amazing mom and both of these girls are lucky to be loved by you. Blessed be. I hope you take her to Paris someday!", "Mine did too", "Anyone familiar with the Internet usually does go to the worst possible conclusion. Because unfortunately, that\u2019s the most probable.", "In case the kid really was attached to Carl and felt guilty admitting it to their birth father. \n\nThe bending over backwards isn\u2019t for the adult in either case. It\u2019s making sure the kid is ok.", "Even if that's the case, OP is still well within his right to bar carl from seeing his son. There are lots of things I wanted to do at 14 that I wasn't allowed to, but I was 14 and 14 year olds aren't mature enough to do everything they want to.", "OK, fair point.", "With less negative perception about divorce, people are willing to prioritize happiness. It is handled poorly by a lot of people, but so is almost everything.", "Part of me agrees, part of me doesn't. I see no reason to stay in a relationship if you're truly unhappy or hate/resent your partner. Divorce can traumatize children, but so can having two parents that are always at each other's throats or having one or two deeply depressed parents. \n\nThat being said, I think you should try your best to make things work,as that's literally what you vowed to when you got married. Also, don't get married so quickly! That's probably the biggest reason these people are getting divorced so quickly. You don't even have to get married if you don't want to. Stop rushing into it!", "Oof, upset a couple of people with this one, shame they couldn't reply with what I got wrong. This fucking site lol", "You make a good point. Bio-Mom, Bio-Dad, and 2 Current spouses. All these people have to get along and work together for Albert's well being, and they are doing it. Carl just can't be a priority among all those relationships unless someone in quintad, particularly the main triad, says he needs to be.", "Kid's mother said no, so Carl ran to OP hoping to undermine her. That action alone makes him 100% TA.", "Or he parented that child for years?", "Oh, I am not surprised at all that it's a big deal for Carl. It would be devastating to have a step parent relationship with a child and then, because of divorce, no longer see the child at all. Carl is wrong, but it's not hard to understand why it's hard to accept.", "If Albert had a good relationship with husband #2 ect and wanted to continue having that, then yes. The degree to which you all think children are solely the possessions of their parents and that they should have the adults in their lives that the parents - their owners - allow and are legally tied to, is frankly frightening.", "She not on board because her new husband doesn't like Carl... But she has 2 kids with Carl, one with Op and one with the new husband.. so they are all linked..Carl is the father of Albert's siblings, and Albert most likely bonded with Carl and Carl bonded with Albert when he was with Albert's mom.. he was with Albert's mom for a couple of years at least, seeing that they have 2 kids. The new husband's the problem. Someone has to be a grown up here.. I hope OP reconsiders.", "Could the son contact Carl if he wanted to?\n\nSon is 14.  Has had Carl in his life for 5 or 6 yrs.  Probably has a phone.  Carl and the son could probably contact each other directly.\n\nIf Dad and Ex Wife are keeping Carl away form their son, nothing is stopping the son forming SM to try and contact the Carl.", "Found Carl.", "CORAL", "Why did you name bro \u2018Albert.\u2019 Hope that\u2019s a pseudonym.\n\nEither way NTA", "Yeah TA", "In order of assholery: Dan, your wife, and You (YTA). \n\nAssuming your son likes Carl enough, you should be thankful someone has bonded with your son and takes an interest in his well-being and wants to treat him like his own children. There are not many people like that and I\u2019m betting \u2018Dan\u2019 isn\u2019t going to be one of them. Dan, you, and your ex need to put your own emotions aside and get your priorities straight,", "You are so the asshole.  Your son was a part of Carl's life, and Carl misses him.  Technically that's not your \"problem,\" but you don't have to be a cold-hearted jerk about it.  YTA.", "YTA & she\u2019s TA as well. He came to you and you shut him down rudely for no good reason. Biological or not, he feels like a father to your child. He was clearly helping raise him along with his 2 children. You\u2019re allowing another man (who has no relation) to dictate what happens with your child.", "On this note i want to warn single men to stay away from single mothers for this exact reason. It\u2019s never worth it because there is an 80% chance you\u2019ll end up twice as hurt", "Carl is also giving me \ud83d\udea9", "My step-dad was my step parent from 2-8. I'm 33 now and still call him dad and treat him as such.", "Exactly. How long was Carl in Albert's life? Seems the mother doesn't want Carl to see Albert because Dan, her current boytoy hates Carl. How often has reddit seen parents throwing kids under the bus to appease their current bed partners? Was a relationship between Albert and Carl established? All of marriage happy Mom's kids need therapy and Dan should have NO SAY on about any kid not his. If Mom has nixed a continued relationship between Carl and Albert because of Dan, she is the AH. Actually, she IS TA in this. Her kids have to deal with all of this drama because she can't stick with a single long term partner, so men are like revolving doors in her children's lives and quite frankly, that sucks.", "OP also clarified Carl has used a slur and made racist comments. Shouldn\u2019t even be a conversation anymore, Carl is 86d from this kids life, as he should be (OP also mentioned his parents are migrants to America making this kid not white and vulnerable to these slurs)", "\"Kid said no\" is really all we need in this situation. Albert should be the sole arbiter as to whether or not a relationship should be maintained unless there are very strong reasons to oppose that. So Albert saying no is really the end of that.", "Aah, I missed that. Seems like a nobrainer at this point.", "It is a red flag but that could be regarding him or the child\u2019s mom. \nShe clearly isn\u2019t the greatest parent. Building to family\u2019s 1/2 siblings and with someone she doesn\u2019t want involved with the man she chose to have 2 kids with. Very possible she is punishing him by holding her son away from him. \nSucks for these kids forced to gain a step parent with no choice and then get half siblings and then suddenly lose step with no choice and also lose closeness with half siblings.. I doubt moon is done so there will probably be another step forced on him soon enough and possibly more half siblings.. \nyeah I am not able to judge who is right or wrong in this because none if the adults seem to make any decision based on what is best for their kids it all seems to be about what they want.", "He has no rights to the child, AND the kid already said they don't miss him. Pretty clear cut that Carl needs to leave that kid alone.", "Did you not read the part where the kid says he didn't miss Carl? If Albert wanted to have a good relationship with Carl, don't you think he would have said he missed him?\n\nI swear, contrarians in this sub just inject their own opinions based on hypotheticals and completely ignore the post itself.", "Well, that definitely makes it worse.", "The only thing that\u2019s important here, is what your son thinks. If he truly has no bond with his former stepdad and no desire to see him, then he shouldn\u2019t see him. What you and your ex-wife think shouldn\u2019t matter. NTA", "All the boys live with their Mum so his siblings missing him isn't a driver here.", "This is the best comment in the whole thread. The end. \n\nIt needs to be upvoted to oblivion. \n\nI\u2019d never want to be a step parent based on the comments from people here.", "honestly he probably thinks he can become some kind of cool uncle figure and get \"revenge\" on the mother.", "His mother is like Boris Johnson. Not very positive \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s OPs very slanted, and possibly coerced, assessment", "My mind considered it but it's also possible that Carl has unhealthy reasons that are not physically abusive.\n\nLike, he's definitely mentally unwell and should be visiting a counselor or therapist. He also shouldn't see Albert and would most likely hurt Albert in some way.\n\nBut assuming that every weird (to say the least) adult is suspiciously what we're implying is not only damaging when done recklessly. It also propels that idea that abuse doesn't exist on a gradient.", "Don\u2019t you think OP has a strange tone?  Would you want to tell a guy like that that you missed your former stepfather?  It seems like you\u2019re missing the issue.", "Well, that leads to the question \"Did they have a good relationship?\" or \"Did Carl think they did, and from Albert's side it was just another in a line of strangers mom parades through his life?\" We don't know the answer and most likely neither do OP or Carl. Going on the assumption that Albert was being honest he said they didn't and that is the only evidence we have to go on. \n\nFor all we know Carl could be wanting Albert to come over with his kids so he can make Albert take care of them. Usually a good step parent realizes that once the marriage is over they need to leave things to the kid if they want to be in touch. Intruding upon the Bio-dad is absolutely beyond the pale. Why on earth would Bio-dad want to give over any of his valuable child bonding time to a guy that is unrelated to his child, especially if the child isn't asking for it?", "I swear everytime there\u2019s important info to be seen, it gets filtered to the bottom lol so inconvenient", "Well, it's hard. It's not dad's responsibility to cultivate a relationship between Carl and Albert, if both mom and Albert say no. That would be choosing this ex over two people he SHOULD be listening to instead. I hope, after all of the replies, he talks a little more to Albert to make sure he understands Albert's feelings toward Carl, and talks to mom about why she said no. He needs a bigger picture so he can support his decisions with more clarity.", "I think children of divorce will be completely fine if both parents maintain a friendship and are healthy coparents. If it\u2019s an ugly custody battle and they hate each other then yeah that\u2019s a recipe for a dysfunctional kid"]}
