It's a great location and we're really happy with the place, but there's one issue that's been bothering me.\n\nThere's a woman who lives across the hall from us who is very chatty and outgoing. She's always trying to strike up conversations with us in the hallway or the elevator, and she seems to have a lot of free time on her hands. At first, I didn't mind it too much. I'm a friendly person and I like getting to know my neighbors.\n\nBut then, the woman started coming over to our apartment uninvited. She would knock on our door and ask if we wanted to hang out, or if we had any food she could borrow. She even started showing up when we were having friends over, which made us all feel really uncomfortable.\n\nI tried to be polite and set some boundaries, but the woman didn't seem to get the message. So finally, I told her outright that I didn't feel comfortable with her dropping by unannounced and that I needed my space. She seemed hurt and offended, and now I feel like I might have been too harsh.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680808656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12duqt6/aita_for_telling_a_random_woman_to_get_out_of_my/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole thing is just... a lot.", "NTA. I don't even like friends/ family showing up unannounced.", "NTA. You tried being polite and she didn't get the message. Now she does.", "NTA. If you've tried to set boundaries and she goes past them, that's an issue.", "NTA\n\nShe could be lonely, sure, but that doesn't give her a pass to get pushy and invade your life and privacy.\n\nYou set some healthy boundaries.", "NTA - that's weird behavior on her part and she needs some boundaries", "NTA. The average person knows it's rude to do the things she does. I have a neighbor like this, but not to this level. You have to be firm with some people before they get the hint.", "NTA, boundaries are healthy and you weren't rude", "NTA. She\u2019s lucky you\u2019re so patient", "NTA she can\u2019t just assume she\u2019s on a sitcom", "Something similar happened to me. The person lived nearby and was a physically intimidating 6 feet tall special needs person who didn\u2019t know he was behaving inappropriately by standing outside my house at midnight or following me round, getting on the same bus and even following me to work. He\u2019s the reason I learned to drive.", "NTA she sounds entitled and annoying and you have the right to privacy.", "NTA at all. You are just trying to maintain a healthy boundary that should have gone without saying.", "NTA.  All you did was establish a healthy boundary", "NTA. You did all the right things and it didn\u2019t stick. At the end of the day, she has to be responsible for her behavior and if her feelings are hurt because of her behavior.", "NTA you set boundaries, she ignored them, and now faces the consequences", "NTA. She was overstepping. Nobody wants random people in their home.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe her friendship, and it sounds as though her personality wasn't invigorating. \n\nAnd that's the end of it.", " NTA and start locking your door.", "NAH. some people are okay with the pop-in. it's absolutely fine that you're not, and now that you've set that boundary, that's important and it should be respected. it won't stop you from being friendly with her.", "NAH. She's struggling to make friends and thought she made new ones with you and your roomie. You and your roomie weren't making friends, just being good neighbors. \n\nYou did the right thing. To try and repair things with you her you can try and reiterate that you want to be good neighbors. Tell her how she can lean on you in future with things like watering her plants if she's on a trip, and make a point to bring her a (disposable, nothing to be returned) plate of food when you cook something like a big pot of chili in the next week or two.", "Is she called Penny?", "NTA. She\u2019s toooooooo much.", "NTA. Never feel bad about setting firm boundaries.", "NTA. She is overstepping your boundaries.", "NTA. People like this count on you not setting any boundaries, and they only get more annoying as time goes on. The next thing you know, you have no time or space to yourself. My mother in law is like this and so was someone who lived near me when I was in college. You HAVE to get rid of them before they fully take over your home. You did the right thing.", "NTA-You shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable in your own space. She needs to know there are boundaries.", "It really is. She came back today like at 8 pm and I was so tired of her so I told her to GTFO", "Same this would drive me nuts.", "She may be lonely because she did this to everyone else who might have been a friend.\n\nBut that's not OP's problem to fix, or even put up with.", "This was my first thought! Asking to borrow food? If OP doesn't maintain boundaries, they'll be living next to Kramer.", "No that will be a mixed signal. Some people don\u2019t have boundaries and forget others do. Don\u2019t lead her on by accident with yummy chili. Just be polite when you see her and if she seems hurt say \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings but I\u2019m more of an introvert and get uncomfortable being so outgoing\u201d. She should understand that and then it shouldn\u2019t be awkward.

If you didn't say anything, she was going to eventually move in, wear your clothes, demand money.\n\nAnd the crazy part, you were probably upfront the whole time, but left in utter shock when she just walks in after you say, \"not right now,\" right? Yeah, I don't know if this small percentage of the population does this intentionally or not, but it's exhausting. Enjoy the silence and don't back down because you'll have to actually yell next time. Don't feel bad, she sure doesn't feel bad at all about YOUR discomfort, only herself.", "Is your neighbour a Sim? NTA.", "NTA. You have been incredibly patient with this woman, but she clearly isn't sharing your reality. Make sure to keep your door locked at all times, and don't hide a key by the door, etc., so she can't come in uninvited.", "NTA. Her intentions and such may of been good (in her mind), and maybe just wanted a friend. However, not acknowledging the boundaries you tried to clearly set nicely, is pretty out of line. You have all right to feel comfortable in your home. You also have all right and reason to be more \"aggressive\" the last time you set your boundaries.
