I can see why your stepmom was annoyed but I don't see any problem here. Your dad doesn't care so it's fine in my book.", "INFO: does he know you're changing", "NTA, first it wouldn't be weird even if he could see, you're his daughter. Second it's gross that she is sexualizing your relationship with your dad.", "Nta but did he know you was changing your bra was the question I feel like if he knew creepy but if he didn\u2019t he can\u2019t see shouldn\u2019t matter", "NTA but be careful, these blind dudes love perving on topless girls (especially their daughters)\u2026 didn\u2019t you know?", "NTA, your mom is the AH", "I need to see the corpus delicti to decide.", ">She says its still inappropriate even though he can\u2019t see. She asked me when I feel the need to show off in front of my dad and I got mad at her. My dad doesn\u2019t care if I change in front of him.\n\nThere is nothing inappropriate about your body. It's inappropriate for her to be sexualizing you. She shouldn't care what you wear. Not her body and you're not flaunting yourself", "NTA\nWhy is step mom sexualizing any of this? Also your pops probably helped change your diapers once upon a time. She is weird. \nYour dad is blind. He can not see you. What is she missing?", "OMG so messy. Weird& inappropriate.  Blind or not, just fucking not a thing. Nope. Not an AH but definitely something strange going on there.", "NTA, he\u2019s your dad. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve been naked around him before. It\u2019s super sus that her mind automatically went to it being sexual.", "lind doesn't always mean completely sightless - in fact only 15 percent are in that category. I mean, he's not going to be able to see clear boob but probably is completely aware that she's nude or topless so it is in fact weird and inappropriate.   \nStepmom is the AH for how she handled the situation, it would have been a lot better to sit down with OP and explain how his vision may not be quite as limited as OP believes (if that's the case) so then OP could make an informed decision.   \nAnd yeah, some dads are pervs who mentally sexualize their daughters and might think it harmless to let their teenage daughter believe he can't see anything when she's nude. The whole \"what she doesn't know won't hurt her\" thing.", "NTA. Your step-mom sounds like a weirdo for sexualizing a situation that was completely non-sexual and that neither party particularly cared about.", "NTA and your step mom needs ... help of some kind.\n\nI'd just call her out every time she makes any more inappropriate comments in the future.  Don't be defensive, take the offensive.", "NTA \u201cshowing off IN FRONT OF YOUR DAD\u201d is she serious? She has some weird gross ass jealousy going on in her messed up head.", "NTA because you have established that it is acceptable for you to be naked in front of him. That\u2019s all that matters really. The only way you would be in the wrong here is if you were naked and changing without his knowledge because that would be taking advantage of his disability to take away his consent. But that is obviously not what is going on here and your stepmom is making a big deal out of something that does not concern her.", "Ummm even MORE reasons to change in front of dad", "What a long con.. gotta give the guy props for that.", "lol", "She has no problem if I change in front of her or if she sees me completely naked\u2026Although I\u2019m not really comfortable with it, we aren\u2019t close", "I didn\u2019t tell him that time, but he\u2019s said before he doesn\u2019t care. I always tell him if he\u2019s in the room and I\u2019m walking by that I\u2019m naked and just got out of the shower though", "Disagree with your particular comment here.  It would be weird and inappropriate. \nAt her age she shouldn\u2019t be stripping off topless and getting changed in front of her dad \u201cif he could see\u201d. I don\u2019t know any normal teenage girl or dad who would be comfortable with that.", "I didn\u2019t tell him", "Yeah its somewhat of a strange thing for her to be bent out of shape over imo. Im not sure if this is a hill you want to die on though maybe just say \"sorry your uncomfortable, nobody cares but you,\" and shrug it off. She's making it weird for some reason but also taking it to another level in an argument might come off odd to others because now your demanding to be naked in front of your dad which then becomes weird .\n\nDont misunderstand tho I don't think your weird , i don't think y. T. A. I do think making it a point to argue over it would be odd.", "Actually - instead of pulling a sour face at you, she should have run out of the room to avoid the inappropriateness of seeing you any longer, right?!! If it\u2019s inappropriate for your blind dad to be near your uncovered boobs, surely it\u2019s EVEN WORSE for your stepmother to be there, since she can actually see them? \n\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, STEPMA?", "I mean... as long as he knows and is fine with it, NTA? it's still weird.", ">At her age she shouldn\u2019t be stripping off topless and getting changed in front of her dad \u201cif he could see\u201d. I don\u2019t know any normal teenage girl or dad who would be comfortable with that.\n\nEver hear of nudists? Some of them literally never wear clothes unless it's cold because they live in nudist resorts. Thousands more visit in the summer and nobody cares", "Of course, but respectfully, this isn\u2019t a nudist resort situation. And, I\u2019m going to assume you don\u2019t have teenage daughters. \nObviously though this is just my opinion as a parent and a daughter but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not alone in that way of thinking.", "If she and her father are comfortable with it then what\u2019s the problem?", "INFO - is he totally blind? Most blind people can see something.", "NTA. This is a very weird thing to get upset about. Very very weird person.", "NTA\n\nYour step mom is being gross. She read the situation and sexualised a teen in front of her dad in a very not sexual situation.", "Nta as long as your dad doesn't care why should she? He can't see you", "NTA", "NTA you don't care, your sad doesn't care. I wouldn't change in front of her though since she's being so weird about your body. Creep.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe. Is. Blind.  \n\n\nTell her to get a grip.", "Your step mom has issues.\n\nNTA", "Does the step mom think he has ESP or Mathew Murdock echolocation? \n\nYou can\u2019t show off visual things if someone is blind!", "EXACTLY what I thought! \ud83d\ude2c", "Imagine if this was the cure", ">And, I\u2019m going to assume you don\u2019t have teenage daughters. Obviously though this is just my opinion\n\nNo I don't but if I did, I wouldn't sexualize them. The human body isn't sexual by default. Nor is it inherently bad. We as intelligent human beings know the difference between teenage girls and adults even if totally naked and those that don't should be locked up and have the key thrown away"]}
