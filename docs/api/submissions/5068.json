But recently he went for a friends overnight party where obviously there were guys any girls and he ended up putting a video of a girl on his story making some sort of joke with her, I didn\u2019t like that and I confronted him saying I would not be feeling insecure if you agreed to post me too but I did not like how you said no to me but put another girl.
