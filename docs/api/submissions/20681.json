I wouldn't do it today.", "NTA!", "NTA, with a note for future reference....\n\nYou're totally in the clear to keep the gear. You're the one that stood in line and went to the effort and all that jazz. Hell, if I had Stoney sign anything, I'd be keeping it in a safe. Frankly, asking for someone else's stuff is kind of assholey...especially their signed stuff. \n\nThat said, for future knowledge, since you know you've got family and friends that are also Knights fans, getting an extra item or two signed to give as gifts can go a long way. The good news is there's likely going to be no shortage of signing events this summer (just saw the Whitecloud has one this week), so more opportunities. Keeping a couple of small items for xmas and birthday gifts can really be low effort/high reward gifting :P \n\nGo Knights Go!

You earned the signatures, you get to decide.  Not hers to give away.  Plus, why should her parents get a signed item and yours not?", "NTA. No way!!! If she wants a signed towel so bad you sign it with your name and date and even the temperature that day so that they know what you went through to get items signed!  Be careful though, your wife may try to gift it herself without you knowing!!!  Do not give them the signed towel.  Nope. No way.", "Give them coffee!", "It's pretty easy to buy signed merch-- if you have the $$", "From a Rangers fan, I sad. Just sad.", "How is OP being selfish and greedy? He already got them merch of their own, then went and waited in the sun to get his own stuff signed. Are you saying that he owes them more additional items?", "Such an odd take.  I'm thinking you weren't burdened with an over-abundance of schooling.", "doesnt work for bleeding ink", "NTA- And when your wife inevitably gives it to them behind your back, you go to their house and take it back without hesitation.", "Oh HELL NO!  I waited for Marchie\u2019s signing for a very long time. I wouldn\u2019t give that stuff away!  At least his was inside", "NTA, yeah no they don't get any signed stuff just because your wife ants them too, she could have stood outside in the heat to get something signed for them if it was that important!", "NTA\n\nBut lock it up because $50 says she'll give it to them the second she gets a chance", "It\u2019s a no. You went out of your way to get a bunch of people team towels, and you waited hours in the Vegas heat to get them signed. Your wife didn\u2019t even do that, so def not a fair ask. Also, a captain signed Stanley Cup winner gear? There\u2019s monetary value too.\n\nYou\u2019ve done enough already, you get to treat yourself too. I like the framed idea!\n\nNTA", "Keep it under lock and key. They will end up with it if you don't.
