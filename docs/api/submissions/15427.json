To get ready, last night i cleaned the kitchen thoroughly and vacuumed the downstairs. During this time she was watching Tv. This morning, i woke up early and took our son downstairs. I fed him, cleaned the dishes, and mopped the downstairs. When my wife came downstairs 30 minutes later, we switched to her watching our son while i got ready to go to the dump. While i was doing this prep (which is a decent amount), she was facetiming her mom. When i got back from the dump and getting gas, she was still FaceTiming and chatting to her mom on the couch. I ate breakfast and was also feeding my son again when she asked me if i was going to tidy up. I said no and that she should do it because i feel like i did more than my share while she sat on the couch and talked to her mom both last night and this morning. She got very upset and said they were my things to tidy up (it was mostly DIY and house cleaning items, which does often fall under my domain). We had a massive fight.

Sure every pregnancy is different, some have it tougher. Doesn\u2019t sound like she was in too much agony tho. \n\nI think it depends on how capable she is. I see many people say you are the AH cause you have to support the pregnant wife but at the same time there are those who have been pregnant and say they can do lighter chores even in the end of their pregnancy.. at least she shouldn\u2019t bossy her man around (after he has been running around without getting any rest) when her friend is coming over.. sure pregnancy makes you hormonal but it doesn\u2019t mean the wife is right and the man is wrong. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure her friend will be ok that the house will be a bit of a mess cause it\u2019s anyway difficult to keep it pristine at all times when you have kids, work and a pregnant wife.", "NAH.

He, as far as we know, lives in the house, too, and has functioning arms and legs.
