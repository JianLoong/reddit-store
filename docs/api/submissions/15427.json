To get ready, last night i cleaned the kitchen thoroughly and vacuumed the downstairs. During this time she was watching Tv. This morning, i woke up early and took our son downstairs. I fed him, cleaned the dishes, and mopped the downstairs. When my wife came downstairs 30 minutes later, we switched to her watching our son while i got ready to go to the dump. While i was doing this prep (which is a decent amount), she was facetiming her mom. When i got back from the dump and getting gas, she was still FaceTiming and chatting to her mom on the couch. I ate breakfast and was also feeding my son again when she asked me if i was going to tidy up. I said no and that she should do it because i feel like i did more than my share while she sat on the couch and talked to her mom both last night and this morning. She got very upset and said they were my things to tidy up (it was mostly DIY and house cleaning items, which does often fall under my domain). We had a massive fight. AITA for not wanting to tidy up?\n\nEdit: to clarify. She is 7.5 months pregnant but not bedridden. She is able to / does a lot of what she normally does but while dealing with pregnancy stuff. I completely hear you guys - i know its hard to create life. I was just asking that she do a little but of the prep that she wanted done before her friend came over. While I am usually in charge of cleaning supplies and DIY items, she knows where they all go.
