You're resentful, you're prioritising your mother over your wife and your wife appears to be trying to focus on your kids and being thwarted by your resentment. It's coming across as likely that you don't miss a chance to emphasise to your wife just how hard on your mother this situation is. This isn't going to end anywhere good.", "No you cannot tell them not to have presents under the tree for your mom. Your kids will survive seeing Granny get lots of gifts. I suggest you warn them first though.", "Dude, you're still making excuses and not seeing the big picture. If you saw your mom being that way, you should have willingly figured out how to go away and give her time. When your wife said she didn't want to spend Christmas morning there, you should've booked the damn hotel. You only caved when it all came out into the open and you saw your mom wanted it. You failed both your wife and your mom even if you finally gave in once your mom said what she wanted.", "We were living above our means and lost our house", "There were multiple loans. One was totally my idea, other was totally hers, and the other was mutual.", "It's almost like we are reading two different version of the same story. I don't get the vibe that OP is trying to place all blame on the wife. They are partners and due to choices they both agreed to, they are in their current situation. If their family lived above their means, then they both contributed to the situation. I also don't read any resentment, except from his wife calling him a cheap mama's boy.", "Just tell then that when you're over 50 or 60 or 70, then you get a lot more gifts.\n\nKids can accept weird logic like that.", "How does your wife and kids look? Equally stressed? \n\nYTA", "So LEAVE.", "We aren't bad guests but my mom has never enjoyed children. Her own was different but she is not a doting grandmother, and she only had one kid for a reason. She can't deal with three of them together. She also wasted a lot of years with my dad, and clearly just wants to be alone with her husband at this point", "Kids are fine. My wife is obviously stressed as am I, but my point is my mom is totally innocent in our financial mess and now hardly leaves her bedroom", "And you don't think that your wife hasn't picked up on your mom's feelings toward her and your kids?  Christ you're dense as Christmas fruitcake.\n\nNow we have a better understanding of why she wants to GTFO of your mom's place for Christmas.  Who the hell would want to subject their kids to a Christmas with people who don't love them?\n\nYTA all the way to Grandma's house with this.", "So they should spend more money to get away for a day, regardless of whether that will increase the duration of their stay."]}
