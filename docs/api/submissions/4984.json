Originally it sounded like you didn't want to do it for frugal reasons, but your wife wanted to shield your kids from the stack of presents they're not getting by spending money and staying somewhere else? This makes no financial sense to me. Also, what grandma doesn't want to see their grandkids open presents on Christmas morning?\n\nI say NTA for trying to stick to your budget originally with your wife and for trying to appease your host when they made it sound like you weren't welcome. But a gentle E S H for no one wanting to put the money towards the kids.", "NTA.\n\nI think the plethora of mama's boys stories on this subreddit has coloured some users' perspectives. I don't think that's what's going on here at all.\n\nThrough some unfortunate circumstance, you are currently not in the position to provide a home for your family. It's clear from your first paragraph that you're very embarrassed by it. I've been in a similar situation. I was taken in by a friend of the family who refused rent so that I could focus on saving. I spent months constantly conscious of my imposition on their time, space, and resources. It was a constant, nagging guilt that just lives in the background of everyday life. Am I right in guessing that you feel the same way?\n\nThis isn't about having more consideration for your mom than your wife. It's about the person whose home you are occupying, telling you that they want to be alone on Christmas morning. This person to whom you owe you and your family's security.\n\nLet's look at the reasons given by both people who are asking you for this favour:\n\nPerson A has brought you into her home and is sheltering your family for free. She has and will be saving you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. She has not asked for anything in return *except* that you spend a fraction of that money you have been able to save (largely thanks to her) so that she may enjoy the privacy of her own home for a short time.\n\nPerson B is concerned that her children will feel hurt or jealous if they see someone else get a bunch of presents while they only get a few. They're going to think that Santa forgot about them (which would be devastating), or that your mom has connections in the North Pole and didn't bother to share them with her grandchildren (also devastating). But there could have been a compromise here.\n\nYou could have opened the gifts for your kids first, and then taken the family out of the house to go do some Christmasy thing, leaving your mom her husband to open their gifts together.\n\nShe could have opened hers first while you played with the children in another room.\n\nYou could all have opened gifts together, with your mom setting some aside to be opened later when she had some alone time with her husband. Cue you doing Christmasy things outside as a distraction.\n\nYou could have told your kids that last Christmas, your mom's gifts were lost when they fell off Santa's sleigh. He's delivering them along with her gifts for this year, so she has double! Silly reindeer! It was all Prancer's fault!\n\nIn other words, there are a ton of options that would put Person B's concerns to rest without having to shell out much-needed money for a hotel room. But Person A pretty much said they would like the house to themselves for Christmas...there's really no way around that.\n\nI'm not getting vibes that you're a \"mama's boy.\" I think your wife made a suggestion that, while coming from a place of genuine concern, wasn't the most sensible.

Material gifts and stressing over extravagant dinner are considered vulgar for us. And I actually think that. We get something symbolic for children like some festive candy or more traditionaly a sachet of prunes and nuts, and bring a courtesy gift to the hosting members of the family. The most important thing on the table is traditional Christmas bread in which we put a coin, one corn grain and one piece of a small branch from the oak tree. Those symbolize wealth, abundance and longevity. We all together break the bread with hands after the prayer and that starts the dinner. The feeling I get when we join hands in gratitude for being all together is all that matters and I would never change it for any sort of gift that can be bought with money.\nI don't have the verdict here, but it is really painful to hear that families act like this.

There is the financial adjustment due to an increase in food and utility costs, there is the vast reduction in privacy, there is adjustment to having small children in the house again which increases noise level, requires changes in schedules to accommodate children's dinner and bedtime, there is more mess to clean. Then the inevitable small tensions that arise when 2 families are living together and have their own routines. And juggling a lot of personalities in one space. It puts stress on both families sharing space. That's not to say there aren't rewards too. There are.  But a break and some space is often beneficial for everyone.

Usually when people have a hard time, the lifestyle drops a few notches\u2026not going from a luxury home and vehicles to broke and living with mom with no money for Christmas presents for the kids.", "5 extra people in a house set up for 2 tends to be a cramped, difficult experience.", "This entire post is confusing.\n\n1.  Who wants to spend Christmas alone?  Everyone I know seeks out family at Christmas.  I can see wanting a hotel for a night after the Christmas craziness dies down, but Christmas Eve??  That\u2019s weird.  You wouldn\u2019t even have a tree there?\n\n2.  Who are all the gifts under the tree for??  If mom and husband are the only other people in the house, do they really buy that many gifts for each other? \n\n3.  If you can afford a hotel room for multiple nights, but are choosing not to, you are not destitute.  If your wife is so worried about the kids being disappointed, why not use some of the money to buy a few more gifts?? Wouldn\u2019t that be the more reasonable solution?  Inexpensive practical gifts would fill out the tree if it\u2019s a concern.  New clothes/pjs/ school or art supplies/ or even buy used.  Your kids would surely appreciate it more than waking up Christmas morning in an unfestive hotel room away from grandma and grandpa. \n\nESH- When you have children, Christmas is mostly for them, and all the adults are thinking more about their own Christmas preferences instead of what the kids would like best.", "INFO\n\nCan you elaborate on why there will be many present under the tree, but none for your kids? WhIle I don't think grandparents should go crazy getting kids presents, it just strikes me as odd that there are many presents, but it seems like none or very little is for them.", "\"We shouldn't be spending money to keep my mom happy\"\n\nYour wife is the asshole.", "YTA\n\nMummy = important\n\nwifey = unimportant. suck it up, lady. deal it or divorce me- your choice\n\nwife: I am fed up. divorce\n\nop. surprised Pikachu-face", "NTA. I think wife got MIL to push her position. I can\u2019t imagine MIL picking CHRISTMAS as a time for \u201cme time\u201d. She could do that any day of the week. I think it\u2019s a stupid waste of money by a selfish wife.", "Hey, I\u2019m a mamma\u2019s boy, this guy\u2026 Yeesh.", "That\u2019s great but it just isn\u2019t her personality. She raised her kid and is allowed to want to focus on her marriage. She isn\u2019t the one buying those gifts for herself so that is a moot point", "That\u2019s what we are doing. My mom wanted the house to herself, not to go to a hotel", "Lmao are you assuming she is buying the gifts herself, then wrapping them herself, and stacking them under the tree", "Punishing my kids because she\u2019s protecting her sanity? Would it rather her force herself to be around us until she snaps. She is the sole reason they have a home at the moment", "Your mother chose to take you and your family in. She didn't have to. That was her decision. Why are you being so hard on your wife who probably just wants a break from your mother's disapproval. You both made financial mistakes. Try to forgive each other instead of blame each other....Your kids are innocent in this.", "Helping a son in need of help is punishment lol \u2026.your mom sucks its not like this is permanent\u2026i assume its just a temporary situation", "YTA - The difference between the two is that your mother said this in front of your wife. Whereas your wife asked you privately. Your mother made sure to take a dig at your family, wife included, letting her know that she and your family are not wanted around. Your mother isn't being punished.... she made this decision to allow you to move in, whether you like it or not. Your mother agreed to let you stay in her house. She didn't have to.... she decided, and it was so. And although I know you see that as a blessing, you're also acting as if your mother didn't have a choice in this matter, but she did... your wife obviously asked you in confidence to stay at a hotel to avoid your children being overly disappointed and maybe to spare her feelings too. Meanwhile, your mom wanted to ensure to make you all feel unwanted and more terrible than you already may feel. Yes, your mothers feelings matter, but so should your wife's feelings just as much, if not more.", "My single downvote is not going to counteract the 4000 idiots that voted for this without reading the OP.", "Having five extra people in your house for months on end... yeah some people could happily do it for family and some would be losing their mind. She is the latter", "Sorry but that\u2019s very manipulative and I think OP is in the right to NOT go to his mom and pull that card. \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen on hard times but your grandkids shouldn\u2019t have to suffer. Buy them a Christmas.\u201d That teaches the kids so many bad habits and backs grandma into a corner. I\u2019ve seen members of my family do that to my grandparents and it always leads to resentment. She\u2019s already given so much with free housing, asking for more is biting the hand that feeds, I don\u2019t care if grandma is loaded (that was never specified btw. She could be house poor with not a lot of extra income for all we know). \n\nOP\u2019s right; it\u2019s a good chance to teach the kids about frugality, humility, and the true meaning of Christmas. Depending on how old the kids are, it might not be difficult to explain that \u201cmom and dad did their best this year,\u201d without going into depressing detail about why they\u2019re in their situation. \n\nThe \u201cpile of gifts not for them\u201d might just be the wife hyperbolizing reality. Besides, how does she know the dollar value of all the gifts? How does she know most of it isn\u2019s for extended family? Would the kids care that grandma got a new coffee maker and gift cards to restaurants instead of toys and video games? It sounds like the wife is projecting her stress, even though I can see where\u2019s she\u2019s coming from with the hotel and I do think OP is TA for not at least acknowledging his hypocrisy.", "She could be my dad, my in law, a random friend, I would feel this guilt for imposing my entire family on anyone and invading their house", "I work in a hotel. If you wanted to book a room for even one day on Christmas morning on this short notice, you'd be paying like $150 for our cheapest room, AND we're the cheapest hotel in the area in a pretty low income state.", "I mean you just pulled that out of your ass. That is not how we handled finances at all", "People get their houses foreclosed upon daily. Thousands of people get laid off daily. 50% of people making over $100,000 a year live paycheck to paycheck. Banks will give you loans because your income shows you have an ability to pay. They can't factor in your spending habits. \n\nOP never states what happened to start all of this, but it doesn't really matter. Money earned became less than money spent. Once that happened this house of cards came tumbling down. \n\nRegardless of who you want to blame, they don't have the money to spend on anything that isn't a necessity. But once OPs mom requests it, it becomes a necessity. Their whole situation would be 1000x times worse without the mothers support. So they can't afford to not go along with his mom's wishes.\n\nI believe most people who suggest OP should have gotten the hotel, don't truly understand how dire their situation is. They are one depressed safety net away from sleeping in the park. I believe most people here are fairly young and possibly still live with their parents. Their comfort with having no money is apparent. When you are an adult with kids, no money is terrifying. You need money to exist. Expenses of a family of 5 add up quick."]}
