If you take the word \"mom\" out of the equation and replace it with \"host,\" I'm pretty sure nobody here would be upset about you rethinking your Christmas plans to grant your host privacy. Your kids are also really young; unless you've been spoiling them rotten every other Christmas, getting some cheaper gifts isn't going to sully their memories of Christmas if they've got a lick of sense in them. If the weather's not too bad, you could plan a day trip somewhere with your family to give your mom and her husband some time to themselves.\n\nNTA", "I think your mom just played you against your wife.", "YTA to your wife but also because you're not thinking of your children lol", "Your wife's reasoning makes no sense. If you can afford a hotel room, you can afford additional presents for the kids.

Spending the money to give your Mum some privacy as a favour after she's been hosting all of you rent-free is vastly different to what your wife was proposing. \n\nBut personally, I would just take the wife and kids out for the morning rather than consider a hotel room. Pack a picnic and go to a park or the beach if weather allows. Give your Mum a break and some privacy without the price tag.", "Wait, I'm a little confused. Getting the hotel because your wife requested it or mom said it would be nice aside, why don't you take the money that you would spend on that and get your kids more gifts? Originally it sounded like you didn't want to do it for frugal reasons, but your wife wanted to shield your kids from the stack of presents they're not getting by spending money and staying somewhere else? This makes no financial sense to me. Also, what grandma doesn't want to see their grandkids open presents on Christmas morning?\n\nI say NTA for trying to stick to your budget originally with your wife and for trying to appease your host when they made it sound like you weren't welcome.

I don't think that's what's going on here at all.\n\nThrough some unfortunate circumstance, you are currently not in the position to provide a home for your family. It's clear from your first paragraph that you're very embarrassed by it. I've been in a similar situation. I was taken in by a friend of the family who refused rent so that I could focus on saving. I spent months constantly conscious of my imposition on their time, space, and resources. It was a constant, nagging guilt that just lives in the background of everyday life. Am I right in guessing that you feel the same way?\n\nThis isn't about having more consideration for your mom than your wife. It's about the person whose home you are occupying, telling you that they want to be alone on Christmas morning. This person to whom you owe you and your family's security.\n\nLet's look at the reasons given by both people who are asking you for this favour:\n\nPerson A has brought you into her home and is sheltering your family for free. She has and will be saving you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. She has not asked for anything in return *except* that you spend a fraction of that money you have been able to save (largely thanks to her) so that she may enjoy the privacy of her own home for a short time.\n\nPerson B is concerned that her children will feel hurt or jealous if they see someone else get a bunch of presents while they only get a few. They're going to think that Santa forgot about them (which would be devastating), or that your mom has connections in the North Pole and didn't bother to share them with her grandchildren (also devastating). But there could have been a compromise here.\n\nYou could have opened the gifts for your kids first, and then taken the family out of the house to go do some Christmasy thing, leaving your mom her husband to open their gifts together.\n\nShe could have opened hers first while you played with the children in another room.\n\nYou could all have opened gifts together, with your mom setting some aside to be opened later when she had some alone time with her husband. Cue you doing Christmasy things outside as a distraction.\n\nYou could have told your kids that last Christmas, your mom's gifts were lost when they fell off Santa's sleigh. He's delivering them along with her gifts for this year, so she has double! Silly reindeer! It was all Prancer's fault!\n\nIn other words, there are a ton of options that would put Person B's concerns to rest without having to shell out much-needed money for a hotel room. But Person A pretty much said they would like the house to themselves for Christmas...there's really no way around that.\n\nI'm not getting vibes that you're a \"mama's boy.\" I think your wife made a suggestion that, while coming from a place of genuine concern, wasn't the most sensible. Your mom made the same suggestion but for very different reasons. Both are legitimate, but one can be addressed through compromise and the other cannot.", "NTA- it\u2019s a totally different situation when a host tells you they\u2019d be happy for you to leave vs making the decision to leave on your own. \n\nIt was manipulative and questionable for your wife to engineer this situation.

Material gifts and stressing over extravagant dinner are considered vulgar for us. And I actually think that. We get something symbolic for children like some festive candy or more traditionaly a sachet of prunes and nuts, and bring a courtesy gift to the hosting members of the family. The most important thing on the table is traditional Christmas bread in which we put a coin, one corn grain and one piece of a small branch from the oak tree. Those symbolize wealth, abundance and longevity. We all together break the bread with hands after the prayer and that starts the dinner. The feeling I get when we join hands in gratitude for being all together is all that matters and I would never change it for any sort of gift that can be bought with money.\nI don't have the verdict here, but it is really painful to hear that families act like this.
