Don't you think she feels embarrassed and uncomfortable living with your parents? How about your kids?   Find a compromise. Take the wife and kids for a drive. Go volunteer at a shelter. You and your wife are blessed and the only thing you see is what you are missing (lots of gifts under the tree) instead of what you have.", "This is such a morally grey situation. Regardless of whose feelings OP puts first, he's at SOMEONE ELSE'S house for the time being so they have to put the wishes of the homeowners first, as any guest would do. Not because you love the homeowners more (whether they're your parents or... idk, a weird landlord who gives you a 95% discount for unknown reasons). It's being uncomfortable in someone else's home that leads to his decision to go to a hotel. Not because his mom said so but because the owner of the house where he's staying for free\\* has a request (even if an indirect one).\n\n\\*idk if OP is staying there for free but whatever their arrangement is, it's cheaper than rent and it largely sounds like his mom and her husband are doing him (OP) a favour. \n\nIf I'm staying at my partner's colleague's house for a month (together with my partner, of course), and I really wanna go to a restaurant but we have no money, but then the colleague says he has a family event that night and needs his OWN house free of non-family people, of course *then* I'd consider going out regardless of whether I can afford it or not because I have no choice and because these people have already done enough for me so I can at least thank them by getting tf out when they need their space to themselves. \n\nSo in conclusion NTA.

I get kids have to learn at some point about the reality, but your wife isn\u2019t wrong in wanting to shield them. The gift thing at holidays is hard to straddle and it seems like maybe they would be around other kids in the family with a lot of gifts? You don\u2019t say how old the kids are but at some ages they just don\u2019t get it and will just feel bad.\n\nAlso not sure if you live in cold weather climate- you could have turned it into part of their gift if you chose a place with indoor pool and watched a movie together in the room.
