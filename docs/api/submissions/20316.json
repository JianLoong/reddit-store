Send them back unopened and have you SO have a discussion with her about how she has not apologised to you and how she feels the need to be mean and petty to children. Until she grows the heck up, keep her out of your life.", "NTA. They're all your children, both yours and your hubby's according to your post. Personally, if my MIL will not treat my children equal regardless of if they're \"bonus\" or not then I'd rather she not treat them with anything at all", "INFO: Are you saying the two older kids are your stepchildren? I'm just a bit confused by the wording. Either way, NTA.\n\nRegardless of whether they are your own children or not, it's absolutely not okay for her to treat your youngest any differently than them, regardless of her feelings about/towards you. Sending the presents back is probably the smartest move so that your daughter doesn't feel like her grandmother doesn't love her when she loves the other two. It's pure exclusion, and it's not okay to do that to children in any situation, let alone as an *adult* who is their *grandmother*.", "NTA it\u2019s completely inappropriate for her to buy 2 kids gifts and purposely leave the other one out. Even from afar she\u2019s managing to cause problems between you and your SO. And your SO is taking her side? That\u2019s a huge \ud83d\udea9 for him. How can he be ok with his moms blatant favoritism. I\u2019d send them back just to prove to her that you didn\u2019t keep them but if it\u2019s too much work or she sends them again you could throw them in the trash unopened. Then no one feels pressure to buy more gifts. Maybe marriage counseling for you and hubby to work on boundaries with the in laws and communication between each other?", "NTA - and I find it odd that your husband supported you and went NC when she was treating you like shit but he wasn't there to see it. Now he's seeing that his mum is treating one of his kids badly and he doesn't seem to care. I absolutely think you're doing the right thing, reject the parcels at the door when they get delivered and you won't have to pay to return them to her.", "NTA. Your MIL is deliberately trying to start trouble and divide and conquer. Please read up about narcissists. It sounds like your MIL might be one. Going no contact again would probably be best.", "NTA. HOWEVER. You have a much bigger problem than just a MIL problem. The real problem is that your husband doesn't see that HIS youngest child is being singled out by his mom because of her relation to you. He doesn't see that while his older two children are getting lavish gifts the youngest is getting nothing. \n\nBut. Sending the gift back isn't going to solve this problem either. It's going to make the older two children resent their sister because they're not getting gifts from gma BECAUSE of their sister. Unless, you are secretly opening the gifts, finding out what's insides, and then buying them, and making those gifts from you and husband. That way none of your children are getting gifts from gma. \n\nYou and husband need to be on the same side. And your husband needs a serious wake up call to see what both his inaction and his mother are doing to his youngest child.", "NTA send the gifts back and tell your hubby y\u2019all need NO Contact again. This is about mistreatment of your children. No no no. Put a stop to it.", "NTA \n\nHave your husband explain how *you\u2019re* the petty, overreactive one. Have him explain it real slow cuz it\u2019s not making sense to me", "NTA. Is sending items COD still a thing?", "Those gifts are meant for your older children. By returning something meant for them you will only make them resent you and your daughter. \n\nAt 10 and 11 they are old enough to understand discrimination and what's fair. Have an honest discussion with them on what you all can do as a family so that the youngest child doesn't feel left out. \n\nDon't post this problem on Reddit, make a FB post about how your MIL hates your child and ignores her while pampering the bonus children. Say that you love all your children equally and you as a family (you and all your children) have taken this call.\n\nLet MIL contend with social humiliation from friends and extended family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
