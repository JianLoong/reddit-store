This will lead to not only Hippo being put down, but the potential of injury/death of something else as well.\n\nAlso, as someone that grew up across from an aggressive dog that ended up attacking my sister, I completely see where your wife is coming from. Babies and toddlers aren't good with boundaries and don't have the knowledge to realize when an animal is showing warning signs.

Your wife doesn't like the dog, but you married her anyway.  Then you agreed to get rid of the dog, but rather than finding the dog a good home, you take him to a shelter, and don't disclose his history of aggression, because the dog didn't kill anyone--yet.  I can see why your wife doesn't want the dog around a new baby, and she is right that the history of the dog needs to be disclosed.  However, rather than being an adult, you choose to blame her for your lack of initiative.  You need to find Hippo a home--taking a longtime pet/friend to a shelter and washing your hands of the situation is the laziest, most uncaring thing you could do.", "YTA!!

You need to call the shelter and tell them the truth.", "YTA\n\nThe reason that the first shelter refused to take him and that the second shelter might put him down is because he's dangerous. The fact that he didn't kill anybody is an incredibly low bar to set. Should we just wait until he does?\n\nFact of the matter is that *anyone* who takes in Hippo deserves to have a complete picture of his history so that they can decide if they are comfortable with the associated risk and handled him accordingly. You should absolutely call the shelter and be up front with them.\n\nWhat exactly *was* the \"aggressive episode\" anyways? Sounds like this was more than just a minor nip.\n\nEDIT: I don't buy the cat story. It makes no sense with the way that OP framed the story in the original post.

That isn't necessarily aggression, but prey drive.  However,   it is crappy not to have reported it.  A dog with a strong prey drive is not unadoptable,   but they definitely need to know to know the best place he will thrive. I had a dog with a very strong prey drive (I don't even know how many time I had to de skunk her.  But I didn't try to have cats,  or other small animals around her,  and I was very careful with her interactions with kids (she loved them,  but still).", "Yes w/o reading the whole story.", "Go with a tentative YTA. \n\nAggressive episodes should be disclosed to other people and it should be disclosed *why* there was an aggressive episode. \n\n\nFor example, if you said the dog has bitten and leave it at that, the other person is automatically going to assume the worst. You need to give details on the bite. If your dog has bitten other dogs and has only bit other dogs, then disclose that the dog has bitten other dogs but has not bitten humans. If your dog has bitten children, but not bitten anything else, then disclose that your dog has bitten children and not anything else. \n\n\nYou should tell shelters/potential owners these things and do so in detail. It's not a case of automatic euthanasia. It's a case of actually ensuring the dog actually ends up in a home that is best for them. Not telling is actually more likely to get the dog euthanized. For example, if your dog has issues with cats and you did not disclose that with the shelter, someone who is also a cat owner may adopt the dog, the dog will kill/maim their cat, and the dog will either be euthanized by whomever adopted him or he will be returned to the shelter. \n\n\nYou not disclosing his history to others is not fair to the shelter, potential adopters, or your own dog.", "YTA because even in a throwaway account you can't be honest and transparent about what exactly Hippo has done.  In a comment, you mention that the only episode resulting in an injury was to a stray cat but that implies that other episodes have occurred and perhaps not all to other animals?  People deserve to know the history of the animal they're bringing into their home.  You're also an AH for giving up a dog you purport to love.", "YTA. You should be honest. Prey drive to a cat is one thing, child aggression is another. But the place you took your dog needs to know to place the dog with the best owner for it.", "YTA. You not communicating this to the shelter may have made your life easier but it does not help the shelter and it does not help any potential person wishing to adopt. I\u2019ve been in a situation in which I wanted to adopt another cat, was assured by the rescue 100% that she was friendly and LOVED other cats. Loved other animals. Had NEVER, in the past, had an aggressive episode. We took her home, and from day one she was violently aggressive with my first cat. We did everything properly to introduce them and if she even smelled the other cat on us, even if she was at the opposite end of the house, she became aggressive and territorial. Whether that was the shelters fault for being dishonest or due to the dishonesty of the previous owner, that put my beloved animal in danger. As well as myself and my husband. You just potentially put someone else, their kid, or their pet in danger for no reason. If you wouldn\u2019t want the dog around your pregnant wife, why would someone else?", "YTA.  I'm sorry you are being pushed into rehoming your dog, that's a difficult situation.  But you need to not lie about the dog's history.  You say there were multiple incidents, only one (a stray cat) resulting in an actual bite.  So what happens if the dog is adopted into a home with other pets and winds up mauling the family cat or smaller dog because you told the shelter he had no history of aggression?  People need to know what to expect with a dog.", "YTA. By not disclosing your dog\u2019s bite history you\u2019re risking him being placed in the wrong home with inexperienced owners and potentially biting again. Yeah it would be harder to find somewhere to take him but that\u2019s because only somewhere equipped to take him would do it. \n\nAlso dogs are a lifetime commitment. If you can\u2019t commit for their life, don\u2019t get one. I understand that sometimes people\u2019s circumstances change beyond their control and they have no choice but to rehome their pets but you chose to marry someone who didn\u2019t like your dog and then presumably chose to have the baby?

If there has been one incident years ago that has never been repeated then it would be unfair to label Hippo as aggressive. The shelter will assess Hippo\u2019s needs before rehoming him.

Your wife is a much bigger AH here.\n\nI get that your wife does not want Hippo around your new kid, and I think it must have been difficult for you to decide to give him away. However: she should respect that you have feelings toward him and you give him away because of her and your newborn baby, and she should have helped you or at least supported you in finding him a new home. \n\nNot being honest was an AH move, your wife wanting him put down is a super AH move.

Good that you are rehoming but likely might be good to euthanize.", "Edited to say YTA based on more info that came through via comments. \n\nOriginal message said:\n\n you said in another comment that he nipped at a stray cat. I don\u2019t believe this constitutes as dog aggression (if this is the only situation that has happened) and you would have likely had a different outcome at shelter #1 if you phrased it correctly. \n\nYou should have disclosed to the shelter that he is non-aggressive and cat reactive. This would be the more ethical way to do this and a better way to word this. You can still let the current shelter know that he is cat reactive. \n\nAlso, next time (if you experience this again or know someone who needs to re-home a dog) try to find a breed specific rescue or trainer who does rehoming. The shelter is traumatic. The dog endures a mass amount of stress from this type of environment, even if it\u2019s clean to the human eye. You can make a massive impact on the outcome by surrendering to a rescue that is run by fosters instead of a shelter environment.

In a shelter this dog will be labeled a pitbull or pit mix.", ">Staffordshire terriers\n\nThats a fucking pit dude.", "You know its a pit, thats why you left it out. pitbulls have a death sentence at a shelter.", ">Staffordshire terriers\n\nJust plain wrong.... Educate yourself please.  [\"the Pit Bull isn\u2019t technically a breed unto itself or recognized with a breed standard with a kennel club registry. Rather, it\u2019s basically a catch-all term for many of the so-called bully breeds such as the American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, American Bully, American Bulldog, and even the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\"](https://www.rover.com/blog/staffordshire-bull-terrier-vs-pit-bull-whats-the-difference/)", "It wasn't just one incident, according to OP, is all I was contributing. The rescues and shelter are right in not taking him. \n\n\"There were other episodes but that cat was the only one that resulted in actual injury. I think I probably just gave them too much information.\"", "You don\u2019t trust an entire breed of dog because of why? Some made up stories about them lol", "As someone who was severely attacked by a pitbull and could have died if I hadn't escaped (pics on my page as proof) I'd appreciate if you don't use bias/anecdotal evidence. \n\nSure pitties can be very sweet but big dogs leave big bites and can irreparable damage. The shelter should have been informed", "It definitely depends on if the other incidents were prey/territory related or involved humans. \n\nMy terrors have killed several mice, cornered a rabbit, and a fledgling blue Jay. (The bunny, and Jay were assisted in escaping.) The squirrels like to tease them. \n\nI would absolutely say that my guys are not good with a house where any type of rodent was a pet because they would kill it. But they aren't aggressive, they were bread to have that instinct.", "#WHAT WERE THE \"OTHER EPISODES?\"\n\nThere's no such thing as too much info when reporting the dog's behavior.

It's not okay to endanger other people's pets to protect Hippo, and things will end badly for him anyway if he kills the next family's cat or bunny.", "Okay but what are the other incidents? \"once bit a cat\" is not an aggressive episode, it's a dog that doesn't like cats. \n\nWhat aren't you saying?", "Bingo. Some simpletons here can't hold onto complex thoughts such as two or more things being true at once. She may be afraid of that dog, be a responsible dog owner by rehoming said dog, love that dog yet resent its aggression, respects her husband's love for his dog, and is making a wise choice as a soon-to-be mom of an infant. For all we know, she could be angry that he's putting the dog's life at risk as well as the potential new owner's life. We're only getting a one-sided and emotional view of someone who admitted he was lying and fudging the truth to make him & his dog look better.", "Yeah, OP notably was vague about the aggressive episode. But the way he chose to describe it was suggestive of this being a significant incident. I suspect it's also part of why the wife doesn't like the dog and why she wants it rehomed before they have a child. I also suspect the fact that they're having a child is why he agreed now. Until OP provides more information, this is what seems most likely to me.\n\nDoes he have a greater obligation to keep this dog alive than to keep his child safe?\n\nWe could say maybe he shouldn't have had a child in the first place... but the ship has sailed on that one.", "Source: \"trust me bro.\"\n   \nYou're trusting a redditor who lied to the shelter he left the life of his dog with. A self-admitted liar who lied about the aggressive nature of his dog. Sure. Trust him when he says the dog isn't that aggressive lol.", "Source: \"trust me bro.\"\n   \nYou're trusting a redditor who lied to the shelter he left the life of his dog with. Can you see how that might be unwise?", "Yep, that's why the first shelter rejected the pit. Op is such an asshole, imagine it get rehome and kills a baby or someone.", "Because statistically they are more likely to do harm then my Labrador. I love some pits that I\u2019ll cuddle with on the couch while I watch tv or whatever. They can sleep on my bed with me when I pet sit them, but they can\u2019t be around my cats or any small children in my life. Because they tend to be an aggressive breed with jaws that can do a lot more damage then an aggressive lab or chihuahua or whatever other dog breed you are going to list.\n\nBut yeah the cat I loved for 10 years is a made up story in your eyes", "I want to know this too. If the \u201cother episodes\u201d involve nipping at strays that\u2019s a totally different story than nipping at humans. I would never call a dog that nips at a stray \u201caggressive\u201d. That\u2019s just a high prey drive, but the shelter still needs to know this so they know to adopt Hippo to a home where he is the only animal. OP is so vague that I can\u2019t tell if:\n\nA) OP screwed poor Hippo and his potential adopters by not disclosing a high prey drive \n\nor\n\nB) OP screwed poor Hippo by not disclosing that he has nipped at humans and is actually aggressive\n\nBoth of these are different paths to a sad ending for poor Hippo. YTA OP.", "> Does he have a greater obligation to keep this dog alive than to keep his child safe?\n\nThat is not the issue at hand at this moment. The issue at hand is whether to rehome the dog, and if so HOW to rehome the dog. I think rehoming is a poor choice in the absence of more detail. But IF that is the choice, OP is going about it badly in a way that is more likely to end in a dead dog."]}
