So there are three adult women and four children, none of which you have legal custody of, in one household and your sister has decided she\u2019s delegating a certain amount of her responsibility for caring for her own daughter to you whether you like it or not. Do I have that right?   Your sister is killing the golden goose and ensuring you will have as little to do with her as possible after you are able to move out. I mostly feel sad for your mom but see that you will need some strong boundaries in the future because your sister will always be trying to force you to be part of the village raising her kids.", "NTA - Does she have depression or some sort of other illness blocking her from mothering her own children? You'd still not be the AH but I ask because of her \"I'm trying\" response to you. How is she trying because it certainly doesn't look like it based on what you said here. What is she doing while her daughter is in the bath that keeps her so busy she can't take a moment to wash her hair? Is she working from home or something during this time? \n\nNo matter what you are not the AH here. You sound like you've agreed to help raise all your nibbling but help doesn't mean you take on all the tasks yourself. Plus her little line about bringing your niece to you if you were to move out just screams entitlement.", "She's going to drop her daughter off at your place every chance she gets if you don't put your foot down now.

She is a bad mom and she should feel bad about it", "NTA", "One thing I hadn't mentioned because I was trying to be fair is that Fran is currently in active addiction. That is where every penny she makes, steals from our mother and gets from child support goes. She cannot go to inpatient rehab because of her insurance type, which I've been trying to help change because it changed my life. She has a prescription for stimulants she sells or uses up in a single day. She has someone who 'fronts' her powerful opiates as needed and will also use street drugs all IV. I at least have her using the needle exchange so that she's limiting her risk. Two days before she went to jail I went in to talk to her and she was lying next to Anita, dead from a heroin overdose with thr spoon, needle and drugs still on the bed. I quickly narcanned her (I keep it on hand because I know she uses) and she began breathing agaun but was then aspirating on vomit. I removed Anita from the room as I called 911 and luckily they're only a block away and were able to come adminster more narcan. When it was all said and done she was pissrd at me because whe claims she never overdosed, I just ruined her hight and gave the police her drugs. Sometimes I consider telling her PO but I can't bring myself to do it.", "What about the other two children? It sounds like Fran is supporting 4 children, and allowing two grown adults to live with her, and OP doesn\u2019t help out, even though she is not working?  Where are the fathers?  Do they contribute?  How severe was the TBI? There is a lot of info missing info ! \nBased on the info I have, OP is the AH.  She is living with her sister, Mother and 4 children. She doesn\u2019t voluntarily help out, and fixing her niece\u2019s hair once or twice a week after niece bathes and complains about it.", "Oh I want to, badly, however I lost my job in Feb and have used savings to pay my personal bills that I have. I have a job interview today, hoping to goes well so I can begin earning again!", "She will start it herself and get in. It often happens when I'm distracted or she'll tell me \"My mama told me to get in and she'll be right up\". She doesn't listen to her mother either, Fran is often asking me for help enforcing rules because she's set a precedent of letting Anita do whatever she wants. Fran was in jail for 60 days last year and the night before she got out Anita was in my room and said \"Tomorrow I get to go back to doing whatever I want\" I was like oh no you don't child, you're not gonna turn out to be a asshole on my watch", "I\u2019m glad I was not the only one who was confused!  In addition to all the chaos, the sister lost her child six months ago???  Sounds like she raised him, it can be even more devastating losing a step-child, because you may not have control over end of life decisions.  She must still be reeling I. The midst of chaos.   If you are her primary support, you are failing badly.", "You have it correct. It should be noted I love my niece and couldn't imagine not being in her life. Her daddy was in and out of prison and just moved several hours away. Anita told me she needs mama more because she's sad and missee daddy and is afraid mama is gonna leave too. I told her its completely ok she feels that way and to let her mother know. Fran's response was she spends plenty of time with Anita. The only time Fran really will focus all her attention on Anita is if the poor baby is having a breakdown crying because she misses her big brother, she misses her daddy... just a myriad of problems a 6yo shouldn't have to be facing. My mother doesn't like Anita because she was born a month after we lost our older sister and Fran gave Anita our late sister's name. So it's difficult for my mom to even say the poor girls name. Its all entirely confusing fucked up", "She has a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and I understand that comes with limitations sometimes. However she has energy to run around with friends or go spend a night at her bfs if he calls and asks to. Who do you think watches Anita and gets her ready for school when that happens? Yup, me. She did also lost her oldest son(technically step but she was the only mom he knew) in December and I have been her primary support for her. However she can't neglect her two very living, very much in need of their mother, children. She really only brings up her oldests death when she's done something wrong (ie I'm sorry I grabbed $20 from you, I'm just having s hard time cuz its x monthe since he died)", "ESH. hmmmm. I jumped to the perhaps erroneous conclusion that both daughters were living with (or do I mean \u2018off of\u2019) their mother. Maybe it is Fran\u2019s house - we don\u2019t know.  OP doesn\u2019t enlighten us about that or the other divisions of responsibility.    But we don\u2019t know how Fran was paying the bills, or taking care of kids, while she was in jail two months last year. The whole situation sounds much more disastrous & complicated than whether Op gives her niece a weekly bath without being asked to. At first I assumed her stepson died when OP said said Fran \u2018lost\u2019 him but that could also be lost in a custody dispute. Not enough information. Both Fran and the grandmother take OP\u2019s presence for granted\u2026what if OP *hadn\u2019t* been at home when the grandmother dropped the 6 year old off without a word? Even single, unemployed women sometimes go for walks or to the grocery store. This family would benefit from more communication.", "Fran is on disability, our mother works. I am jon hunting. I have cleaned her room, taking out over six bags if garbage because she was sleeping on a bed covered in filth. I do her and her daughtere laundry, I do the cooking for the household as well as the majority of the cleaning. Fran will leave the house without notifying anyone she is doing so. The other night Anita came in my room telling me she has to sleep with me because her mama left. I get her kids ready for school. Mind you this all happens even when I'm working. Fran does nothing, she hasn't prior to her oldest sons death and its gotten worse.", "I'm failing? I clean her room (once it was so bad I took out 7 bags of garbage and 3 bags of returnables, all the big blsck garbage bags). I am available 24/7 when she needs a shoulder to cry on, to rant, anything. I use my small stipend of food stamps for the house, we've yet to ascertain what Fran does with hers. I encourage her to not only seek counseling but to attend. I'm the primary caregiver for her youngest while her 13yo relies on my mother. Fran does ntohing and did nothing prior to losing her eldest. She only bathes when she is going to see her bf or one of the dudes she cheats on him with. I give her scalp treatments, detangle her hair, do her and her daughters laundry. Any money I make she somehow gets from me even though she's on disability and gets child support for rhe 13yo. If I'm failing miserably it's because I'm doing too much", "My mom is a minister and the house and bills are part of her compensation package. Fran lost her housing about 3yrs ago due to back rent and the state of the apartment. I had a house but it was determined I should leave my lovely house 7 miles away because I was \"too far\" to help as needed. My mother is a martyt type narcassist who believes she should not have to lift a finger due to all she has done for us over the years. So everything is my responsibility. Hope this helps", "Oh also while she was in jail I had Anita my mom had her son. Her eldest did, in fact, pass away", "As I said, a disastrous and complex situation that OP shouldn\u2019t have to live in and be taken for granted. No answers, only sympathy to you and your mother.", "OP, I apologize it I made it sound like it was any of my business except to help me be more supportive of you. That said, it is my opinion you were possibly guilted into giving up your own home to \u2018help\u2019 and both those other women think they have you trapped by circumstances and by love.  If your sister is unable to take care of her children then someone else needs to get legal guardianship and any of the child support or government benefits.  Your sister has had hard years but if she\u2019s so depressed and disabled she can\u2019t do anything but party with her female friends and f$$k her male friends then changes need to be made or you are still going to be in that house till all the kids are over 18. Take care of yourself and best wishes.", "Thank you for that. I love my sister and I understand she's grieving and her TBI has its challenges. I've begged her to get back into occupational therapy to teach her things she needs for basic life. I think she finally is again. I'm running myself ragged picking up her slack and ignoring my own mental health in the meantime", "UPDATE its about 10am where I live. Anita just came and asked me for breakfast, she told me her mama was sleeping and told her not to wake her up.", "NTA", "NTA.  You've been generous with your time and your patience.  Your sister is a loser of a mother - I feel bad for her kids.\n\nSet those boundaries, and NOT by moving out.  Sounds like Anita needs to learn a thing or two also.  Good luck.", "She says that because Anita and I have gotten so close she'll have a hard time when I leave and will need to have sleepovers", "Ditto.   She is a terrible mother.   NTA", "My plan is to not even been in the same state", "She's just a kid with unreliable parents and a Grandma that ignored her for most of her life because of her name. She's very loving and sweet and she's learning, she remembers everything I tell her. I think she acts out hoping her mom will see her", "Oh also my mom supports my late sisters children and they also get social security death benefits. Those two and the 13yo are very well cared for by my mother, they have everything they could need or want. She's a narcassist so there's the typical emotional manipulation and gaslighting but I try doing damage control after the fact", "On Sunday before the bath, text your sister after the bath you will not be doing Anita\u2019s hair.  after her bath take her down to her mom and tell her to do her hair. Then walk away, don\u2019t do her hair. If Anita isn\u2019t following directions aka getting in the bath then she will now be learning the actions of her consequences. But if you can move out start looking into your options especially if you live will be summer too which means warmer weather and more baths", "If she gets in just get her straight out wrap in towel and send her down for mum. Repeat until her mum gets the message", "Then Anita can't get cold in the bath waiting for her mother. If she has to wait until Fran comes up, she'll either learn to wash her own hair or not to get in the bath until Fran is there.", "Absolutely not. I hate to say it, but if you allow that even once, you will be right back where you started.", "Nope, hard times will pass.  No sleepovers", "\u2018Primary support\u2019 and servant are not the same thing. OP is not fAiLiNg. Hope that helps. Have a nice day.", "If I continue to live here I will either lose my sobriety or end my life. Living here like this is literally killing me. I have no outlet, I have one person I can talk to besides therapists. I had quit going to my one therapist because my mom was consistently hijacking my appointments to try and make my counselor see what a bad person I am. My mother weaponizss my mental health and uses it against me if I share when I'm having difficulty so I just suffer alone.", "And no I didn't feel some type of way about answering questions. I want to be as transparent as possible, hence me adding the comment about Fran's addiction. I was trying to leave that part out because I didn't want people judging her solely on that but I think maybe its important as part of the whole picture", "Yeah\u2026.get a camera for your door when you move out.

So I guess we not finna talk ever sgein", "Not a bad idea. Fran is also a thief. When I was working she'd figure out which card my check got sent to somehow and get the information and spend it all.

This is very familiar to me personally. But regarding the situation at hand, here\u2019s what I think you should do. You need to kick your sister out on her ass (from my understanding all her money goes to drugs so I assume she pays no bills or contributes in any way) and decide whether you\u2019re willing to take on the responsibility of raising these kids yourself, meaning you would work and save up until you\u2019re able to move you and the kids out of that house with your mom (I\u2019m assuming she would probably not object to this). Or even maybe you just take Anita, if your mom would object to you taking the other 3. And you just be their mother figure and start instilling some positive values and discipline in them. Or you should call CPS. Because if y\u2019all won\u2019t kick your sister out, CPS should definitely be doing it when they see the extent of her drug use and neglectful behavior. And they will either require your mom to shape up or they will remove the kids from her care. God knows foster care is not a perfect system, so I would personally do the first option. These kids deserve better. You\u2019re an adult too, so you\u2019re culpable even if you\u2019re not necessarily doing it. You gotta stop being so passive and letting these kids be abused and neglected. That\u2019s no better.", "NTA she Is a bad mom.", "My mom thrives in this because it makes her a martyr. She's a martyr type narcassist and absolutely loves having all this to show how much she sacrificed and what a saint she is. I love my mother but she raised us in a dysfunctional manner and is repeating the cycle with my minings", "They bathe more than once a week. Sunday is the big bath because hair gets done", "My mother has guardianship of my late sister's kids and if CPS got involved they'd open a case on all children. Plus CPS in my county is predatory. They work with probate court and foster care agencies to essentially sell children from poor people. Its disgusting", "Ah okay I know the type", "She's experienced so much loss and uncertainty. If I'm not home she will call my cellphone multiple times to talk to me. I fear when I leave she'll have no guidance or care at all and will end up a hopeless case and it terrifies me. I don't want my niece becoming another statistic", "This is exactly why I call because I'm on the top floor and she's in the basement and I'm not leaving Anita in the tub to go argue with Fran. The reason I'm asking gently is because any other way gets me screamed at berated. I walk on eggshells in my own home, hoping I don't say or do anything to offend my mother, Fran or Fran:s son", "I mean, it seems like the solution is still to take her out of the bathtub and send her down to Fran until Fran starts coming up with her.  If her hair doesn\u2019t get washed, it doesn\u2019t get washed.  If they have to work harder to fix it because it was partially washed and then dried, that\u2019s on them.", " \nDon\u2019t let Anita get in the tub. Send her back down to her mom. Mom comes upstairs before she gets in the tub.", "NTA please find a way to get yourself at of this abusive home.", "Fran won't allow me to do anything with Anita's hair. She finally caved and gave her a haircut last week for the first time ever. Her hair was so uneven and so many desd ends. She lost so much length and it could have been prevented with regular trimming", "If I'm upset to the point I'm in tears my mother either tells me to knock off that whiny bullshit or mocks me with fake crying"]}
