This post is in regards to 6f, we'll call her Anita.\n\nOn Sunday nights I will make sure our niece gets in the shower and after will style her hair for her. Every Sun like clockwork Fran sends Anita upstairs to get in the bath but doesn't accompany her. I will call and text her multiple times, send another child down to get her and she will refuse to come help her child. So every week I then help Anita wash her hair and style it. Sometimes they need an extra bath during the week. This was one of those weeks.\n\nWednesday I wasn't feeling well and Anita (she had been gone from Sat-Tue with other grandparents so Fran didn't have to worry about her) comes upstairs and gets in the bath because Fran had told her she needed to get her hair done. I call and text Fran multiple times and eventually send another kid down to her. She tells him she'll be right up, this is 45mins after Anita had gotten intot the tub. \n\nI wait another 10 mins before Anita tells me she's done playing and is getting cold, I try calling Fran again and once again get no answer, so I add hot water to the tub and help Anita wash her hair and get cleaned up. I end up styling her hair and she lays in my bed and falls asleep.\n\nYesterday Anita gets dropped off by my mom and from lack of vehicle in the driveway she knows Fran isn't home, but knows I rarely leave. Anita knows how to use the phone and calls her mother multiple times. Fran keeps saying she'll be home soon.\n\nWhen Fran gets home I, gently, ask her why she thinks its ok to keep doing this to me. She says she's sorry she didn't realize Anita had been dropped off. I said it isn't just that, its also every bathtime I try getting you to come help your child and you never do. She sighs and goes \"OP I'm trying\" to which I hang up. Now she's upset with me for making her feel like a bad mom. She doesn't care for her 13m either our mother does. So AITA for trying to discuss with her that I'm not a live in babysitter?

So there are three adult women and four children, none of which you have legal custody of, in one household and your sister has decided she\u2019s delegating a certain amount of her responsibility for caring for her own daughter to you whether you like it or not. Do I have that right?   Your sister is killing the golden goose and ensuring you will have as little to do with her as possible after you are able to move out. I mostly feel sad for your mom but see that you will need some strong boundaries in the future because your sister will always be trying to force you to be part of the village raising her kids.", "NTA - Does she have depression or some sort of other illness blocking her from mothering her own children? You'd still not be the AH but I ask because of her \"I'm trying\" response to you. How is she trying because it certainly doesn't look like it based on what you said here. What is she doing while her daughter is in the bath that keeps her so busy she can't take a moment to wash her hair? Is she working from home or something during this time? \n\nNo matter what you are not the AH here. You sound like you've agreed to help raise all your nibbling but help doesn't mean you take on all the tasks yourself. Plus her little line about bringing your niece to you if you were to move out just screams entitlement.", "She's going to drop her daughter off at your place every chance she gets if you don't put your foot down now. NTA", "NTA, and when you move out, DO NOT tell your family your new address so they can\u2019t dump the kids on you.", "Nta. She is a bad mom and she should feel bad about it", "NTA", "One thing I hadn't mentioned because I was trying to be fair is that Fran is currently in active addiction. That is where every penny she makes, steals from our mother and gets from child support goes. She cannot go to inpatient rehab because of her insurance type, which I've been trying to help change because it changed my life. She has a prescription for stimulants she sells or uses up in a single day. She has someone who 'fronts' her powerful opiates as needed and will also use street drugs all IV. I at least have her using the needle exchange so that she's limiting her risk. Two days before she went to jail I went in to talk to her and she was lying next to Anita, dead from a heroin overdose with thr spoon, needle and drugs still on the bed. I quickly narcanned her (I keep it on hand because I know she uses) and she began breathing agaun but was then aspirating on vomit. I removed Anita from the room as I called 911 and luckily they're only a block away and were able to come adminster more narcan. When it was all said and done she was pissrd at me because whe claims she never overdosed, I just ruined her hight and gave the police her drugs. Sometimes I consider telling her PO but I can't bring myself to do it.", "What about the other two children? It sounds like Fran is supporting 4 children, and allowing two grown adults to live with her, and OP doesn\u2019t help out, even though she is not working?  Where are the fathers?  Do they contribute?  How severe was the TBI? There is a lot of info missing info ! \nBased on the info I have, OP is the AH.  She is living with her sister, Mother and 4 children. She doesn\u2019t voluntarily help out, and fixing her niece\u2019s hair once or twice a week after niece bathes and complains about it.", "Oh I want to, badly, however I lost my job in Feb and have used savings to pay my personal bills that I have. I have a job interview today, hoping to goes well so I can begin earning again!", "She will start it herself and get in. It often happens when I'm distracted or she'll tell me \"My mama told me to get in and she'll be right up\". She doesn't listen to her mother either, Fran is often asking me for help enforcing rules because she's set a precedent of letting Anita do whatever she wants. Fran was in jail for 60 days last year and the night before she got out Anita was in my room and said \"Tomorrow I get to go back to doing whatever I want\" I was like oh no you don't child, you're not gonna turn out to be a asshole on my watch", "I\u2019m glad I was not the only one who was confused!  In addition to all the chaos, the sister lost her child six months ago???  Sounds like she raised him, it can be even more devastating losing a step-child, because you may not have control over end of life decisions.  She must still be reeling I. The midst of chaos.   If you are her primary support, you are failing badly.", "You have it correct. It should be noted I love my niece and couldn't imagine not being in her life. Her daddy was in and out of prison and just moved several hours away. Anita told me she needs mama more because she's sad and missee daddy and is afraid mama is gonna leave too. I told her its completely ok she feels that way and to let her mother know. Fran's response was she spends plenty of time with Anita. The only time Fran really will focus all her attention on Anita is if the poor baby is having a breakdown crying because she misses her big brother, she misses her daddy... just a myriad of problems a 6yo shouldn't have to be facing. My mother doesn't like Anita because she was born a month after we lost our older sister and Fran gave Anita our late sister's name. So it's difficult for my mom to even say the poor girls name. Its all entirely confusing fucked up", "She has a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and I understand that comes with limitations sometimes. However she has energy to run around with friends or go spend a night at her bfs if he calls and asks to. Who do you think watches Anita and gets her ready for school when that happens? Yup, me. She did also lost her oldest son(technically step but she was the only mom he knew) in December and I have been her primary support for her. However she can't neglect her two very living, very much in need of their mother, children. She really only brings up her oldests death when she's done something wrong (ie I'm sorry I grabbed $20 from you, I'm just having s hard time cuz its x monthe since he died)", "ESH. hmmmm. I jumped to the perhaps erroneous conclusion that both daughters were living with (or do I mean \u2018off of\u2019) their mother. Maybe it is Fran\u2019s house - we don\u2019t know.  OP doesn\u2019t enlighten us about that or the other divisions of responsibility.    But we don\u2019t know how Fran was paying the bills, or taking care of kids, while she was in jail two months last year. The whole situation sounds much more disastrous & complicated than whether Op gives her niece a weekly bath without being asked to. At first I assumed her stepson died when OP said said Fran \u2018lost\u2019 him but that could also be lost in a custody dispute. Not enough information. Both Fran and the grandmother take OP\u2019s presence for granted\u2026what if OP *hadn\u2019t* been at home when the grandmother dropped the 6 year old off without a word? Even single, unemployed women sometimes go for walks or to the grocery store. This family would benefit from more communication.", "Fran is on disability, our mother works. I am jon hunting. I have cleaned her room, taking out over six bags if garbage because she was sleeping on a bed covered in filth. I do her and her daughtere laundry, I do the cooking for the household as well as the majority of the cleaning. Fran will leave the house without notifying anyone she is doing so. The other night Anita came in my room telling me she has to sleep with me because her mama left. I get her kids ready for school. Mind you this all happens even when I'm working. Fran does nothing, she hasn't prior to her oldest sons death and its gotten worse.", "I'm failing? I clean her room (once it was so bad I took out 7 bags of garbage and 3 bags of returnables, all the big blsck garbage bags). I am available 24/7 when she needs a shoulder to cry on, to rant, anything. I use my small stipend of food stamps for the house, we've yet to ascertain what Fran does with hers. I encourage her to not only seek counseling but to attend. I'm the primary caregiver for her youngest while her 13yo relies on my mother. Fran does ntohing and did nothing prior to losing her eldest. She only bathes when she is going to see her bf or one of the dudes she cheats on him with. I give her scalp treatments, detangle her hair, do her and her daughters laundry. Any money I make she somehow gets from me even though she's on disability and gets child support for rhe 13yo. If I'm failing miserably it's because I'm doing too much", "My mom is a minister and the house and bills are part of her compensation package. Fran lost her housing about 3yrs ago due to back rent and the state of the apartment. I had a house but it was determined I should leave my lovely house 7 miles away because I was \"too far\" to help as needed. My mother is a martyt type narcassist who believes she should not have to lift a finger due to all she has done for us over the years. So everything is my responsibility. Hope this helps", "Oh also while she was in jail I had Anita my mom had her son. Her eldest did, in fact, pass away", "As I said, a disastrous and complex situation that OP shouldn\u2019t have to live in and be taken for granted. No answers, only sympathy to you and your mother.", "OP, I apologize it I made it sound like it was any of my business except to help me be more supportive of you. That said, it is my opinion you were possibly guilted into giving up your own home to \u2018help\u2019 and both those other women think they have you trapped by circumstances and by love.  If your sister is unable to take care of her children then someone else needs to get legal guardianship and any of the child support or government benefits.  Your sister has had hard years but if she\u2019s so depressed and disabled she can\u2019t do anything but party with her female friends and f$$k her male friends then changes need to be made or you are still going to be in that house till all the kids are over 18. Take care of yourself and best wishes.", "Thank you for that. I love my sister and I understand she's grieving and her TBI has its challenges. I've begged her to get back into occupational therapy to teach her things she needs for basic life. I think she finally is again. I'm running myself ragged picking up her slack and ignoring my own mental health in the meantime"]}
