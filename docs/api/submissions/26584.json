She asked if she could set everything up on her own I agreed because I trust my daughter. However things didn\u2019t go right. I was upstairs and an hour into her birthday party I heard the lyrics of Cardi b\u2019s WAP. I texted my daughter to switch the song into something more appropriate and she agreed after a while I heard the same song pop back up. I said the same thing and I warned my daughter that I didn\u2019t like that kind of music. She switched it to an another song and again it popped back up after the song before was done. By now it was 10 O\u2019clock  and it was late so I plugged her speaker off and said \u201cthat\u2019s enough that kind of music isn\u2019t appropriate\u201d. Kids were starting to head out and one of the party goers said \u201cwow Maddie I didn\u2019t know your mom hated rap music, that\u2019s kinda racist\u201d. Before I could even begin to speak she went on to the drive way and left. My daughter turned red and went upstairs. It\u2019s been a week and my daughter hasn\u2019t been speaking to me.

They\u2019re listening to this music outside your house, why would it be any different inside your house? My teens swear, listen to profane music about sex, and watch porn. I\u2019m no idiot. I did when I was a teen. So all of a sudden I\u2019m gonna stop them somehow when I allow them to party with friends in my home? Uhh\u2026 no. Next time, don\u2019t host the party.", "How did I know this was WAP before I even clicked on it? \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m guessing one of her guests put the song on (the second and third times). \n\nBeing a teenager is hard.", "NTA you are allowed to think a song is inappropriate to play in your home.\n\n(Showing my age) My parents wouldn't let me play Add it up by the violent femmes because of the lyrics...not because they didn't think I had never heard the words before but because they didn't want to hear them in their home", "NAH to me. I mean, you don't like the song sure, but honestly it was her party, you gave her full reign, and since the song came up so much there must have been guests at the party who wanted to hear the song. And coming down to turn off the speaker like that was never going to well. You could have handled it with a lot more grace, just be like \"time to turn it down, it's getting late.\"\n\nShe did listen to you the first two times. And definitely the way you phrase it without the context for the guests made it sound bad! Not what you meant to happen and you should talk to your daughter. Apologize for turning the speaker off like that and ask why that song kept playing and have a conversation.", "My brother and I had to sneak our albums into the house, and play them when the parents weren't home. The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Elton John, Alice Cooper, etc. \"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\"", "YTA,  I'm 48, every generation listens to inappropriate music.  You singled out one popular song,  did you approve the lyrics for the rest or did you just not know them? You embarrassed and alienated your daughter.", "Info: were there other children in the house younger than 15? Cause we all can be sure that a group of 15-17 yos aren\u2019t going to be further corrupted by hearing the famously popular song, that\u2019s pretty much been a meme since it came out. \n\nHonestly I see this as a weird hill to die on and embarrass your daughter with. Sure, your house, your rules, but do those rules make sense considering your daughter\u2019s age?", "YTA. At her 16th birthday party-- the first real milestone as a teenager- you embarrassed her in front of all her friends... over song lyrics. That song isn't new it came out over 2 years ago so I guarantee everyone at the party has heard it many times before. Was she even the one controlling the music?  Or did she continuously have to ask a friend to keep switching the songs that she had minimal control over? Was it a playlist she didn't make?\n\nIf you're uncomfortable with rap music (which most teens listen to) that should've been a conversation with your daughter ahead of time on what music you want played in your home.  Or you shouldn't have let her host the party at your house. The racist comment was out of line though.", "YTA it's not racist just stupid and controlling. They're 16, not 6, it's weird to police what kinda music they listen to. They'll listen to it anyway when you're not there. And while I get that you don't want to hear it, it was her birthday party, you could've dealt with it for once.", "In life when you are upset at an event you have 2 options, address it on the spot or address it at a later stage. If you address something on the spot will you ruin the night, will you ensure the event is remembered because of what you said and did, will all the effort and work you put in to plan the event be forgotten because of you making a scene. \n\nThe problem is instead of discussing this on a day when it\u2019s not a huge milestone in your child\u2019s life you decided to throw a tantrum in front of her peers, judgemental 16 yr old peers. That\u2019s the worst thing you could have done and I\u2019m sure you put in a lot of effort to ensure your daughter had a good party, spent money, bought food etc. \n\nDo you think people will talk about that, now all her friends will be saying you are a conservative racist (incorrectly as the song is extremely raunchy). You aren\u2019t necessarily an AH for wanting the inappropriate song not played repeatedly but 100% YTA for stopping the music and causing a scene at her 16th", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might not like that kind of music but your daughter does and it's her b day party not yours.\n\nWhat's so terrible anyway, it's just *music*. It's dumb, it's juvenile, and in a few yeas she'll nat grow out of it & think it's cringe, but its ***just music***. Also, are you only now finding out that teenagers are horny?\n\nWhat terrible harm is going to come from listening to music that it justifies embarrassing her publicly in front of her friends and sabotaging her social life?\n\nYou ruined her birthday and made a scene in front of her friends. That's much more damage than a silly song could do.\n\nIn 10 years no one will remember that song but your daughter will never forget how you judged her music taste and how you caused her public embarrassment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nA similar song that was popular during my youth was \"Gasolina\" and I didn't even like it or care about it that much, but it was very popular & ppl liked it and I wanted to play \"cool\" music so people would like my party and think I'm cool. I thought this was my big chance to make an impression on my classmates.\n\nI remember my father coming upstairs and throwing a tantrum over it & just fuming the whole time over how this & that was inappropriate.\n\nGreat! Now half the class knows I have a lame control freak dad who hates fun and cool music and that if you come to my house an uptight boring man will ruin all the fun. Which I'd laugh off nowadays, but to a teen it's a very big deal, they're a lot more sensitive to what others think of them.\n\nI was super embarrassed and after that I never invited classmates to a party again because I knew my dad would just ruin it and make a fool of me and resent my happiness.\n\nThe incident really hurt my confidence *and* our relationship.\n\nCompared to that, I dunno what greater harm would have been done from briefly dancing to a silly 3 minute song about blowjobs in the safe environment of my parents' house when most of us probably only understood about half the innuendos.", "YTA. Lmao I can\u2019t imagine being this uptight. I guarantee every 16 year old under the sun has heard much worse then the lyrics to WAP", "I think YTA\n\nIt's just a song and she's sixteen... You kinda sound like the type of parents to forbid metal core to your kids. \n\nI'd understand if she was a child but c'mon she's 16 and you're policing what she's listening to ? It's not like she was religiously applying the song to her life.", "One of the guaranteed ways for a parent to encourage their kid to want to listen to an artist, or particular track/album, is for the parent to express dislike for it or them. \n\nIt's not unusual for kids to want to listen to something \"edgy\". It's also not unknown for parents to dislike the music their kids listen to. \n\nRe the question about was the parent an asshole in this situation; it kinda depends on how the music was being chosen. If it was streaming of playlists, then the track wasn't necessarily a deliberately chosen one.  Expecting kids at a party to check every song before it's played isn't realistic.\n\nOverreacting & being controlling of your kid, when you gave her permission to organise her own party was probably an asshole move, though. If you give permission for something to happen without boundaries being established beforehand, it's definitely an asshole move to try & enforce boundaries while the event is happening. \n\nSo, aye - YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s already heard the song a million times and I guarantee knows all the words. She\u2019s 16. Legally eligible to operate a vehicle on the road but can\u2019t handle some sexual lyrics? Regardless of anything, turning it off in front of her friends like that is embarrassing and the fact that you couldn\u2019t cut her some slack for one song on her sweet 16 is pretty lame.", "Well you made sure Maddie will stay known for having a hyper restrictive parents and being somewhat ridiculed in her own house. Now don't be suprised if she won't bring anyone over ever again and will try to get out of the house asap since well.. 18/19 years want to socialize. And you made sure it won't be under your supervision\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOfc it's in your right, you can do it since it's your daughter. You decide. You're not neccessary an asshole for setting boundaries. But you could've prob handled 20more min of this and letting the party end in a normal manner without bringing her any shame and then talked with her about it", "You embarrassed her at an important milestone. You kind of are the asshole, yeah. Not racist though", "YTA. 16 is way too old for parents to be policing lyrics.", "She's sixteen, not six? I think she already knows what WAP means, and if she doesn't, you've failed at the basics of teaching her about sex... \n\nIf you aren't okay with pop music being played in your house, maybe don't let a bunch of teenagers have a party there. \n\nWhen I was her age I was listening to Peaches. My dad admitted he couldn't complain because when he was a teen he had a punk phase and The Sex Pistols and The Slits were his favourites. WAP is mild honestly. You have an unrealistic expectation of how \"innocent\" a sixteen year old is.", "Maybe?\n\nFrom the sounds of it your kid did skip the song when you asked, most people just use a playlist or use random.\n\nIf she is just using random on her phone then it's just the music she has on her phone, most people have stuff on there phone that's not appropriate for there age. And she was trying to do as you asked it's not that unlikely a song would show up on 3 separate times, if it was a playlist then the same song does tend to show up several times also. \n\nSo yes I see why she is not happy with you but also parents are supposed to give rules and trying to inforce them as looking like a \"cool parents\" is nearly impossible or just trying to have your kids like you punishing them. \n\nIt's more of a parenting choise and really depends on what other things you are okay with. \n\nSorry I couldn't be more decisive.\n\nEdit: the spelling.", "Look, I was listening to Closer by Nine Inch Nails, Erotica by Madonna and Let's Talk About Sex by Salt n' Peppa when I was a tween, but I would have been mortified to listen to it in front of my parents. \n\nTeens are going to listen to stuff their parents think is age inappropriate. And (as someone else said, showing my age), I think kids have gotten a LOT bolder about it, so I can see why OPs daughter was embarrassed (C'mon Mom, BE COOL), but yeah, I don't think OP was TA, especially if it got back to other parents that she was letting the kids listen to pretty explicit lyrics. So NTA. If her daughter wants to listen to music with explicit lyrics, she can do it alone or with friends only.", "NAH she was being a teenager, you didn\u2019t like the  song. It\u2019s your house, your opinion trumps hers on this one. She\u2019s likely upset because you embarrassed her and teenagers have a tendency to be dramatic in my experience which is why she\u2019s not talking to you. I would have reacted the exact same way when I was her age and likely would react the same as you if put in that situation now. You didn\u2019t like the song and told her to change it, when it kept coming back on she knew full well that you wouldn\u2019t be pleased. She f-ed around and found out, she will live. The same as when I f-Ed around and played Insane Clown Posse in my dad\u2019s house then found out that when he doesn\u2019t like a song he takes your CD and snaps it in half\u2026", "NTA\n\nI'm over 40yrs old and I won't play WAP within ear shot of my Mom.

More importantly, you don\u2019t seem to realize what kids listen to. You got six graders listening to these types of songs. At 16 years old, they\u2019ve already had health class in middle school. Everybody knows what a WAP is.", "You embarrassed her in front of her friends because you thought the music was inappropriate at a party you weren\u2019t attending but had consented to. You\u2019re not racist, you\u2019re an embarrassment and a liability now. You came down and unplugged the speaker in front of her and her friends. Might as well have really sealed the deal and just turned on gospel music for them instead. They\u2019re 16, you relinquished control when you let your daughter plan and prepare a party in your house. Rest assured, she will never have another party in your house. She\u2019ll leave with her friends and you won\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing or where she\u2019s going because instead of talking to her or pulling her aside AFTERWARDS, you sent her two text messages about the music and then unplugged the party. She\u2019ll be smarter and sneakier next time. Hope that\u2019s what you wanted. YTA", "If you try enough, maybe you\u2019ll be able to traumatize your daughter to hate sex enough so she\u2019ll never do it.

Your daughter should\u2019ve listened but also she may not have been the only one putting on music as usually that\u2019s the case at parties. I think seeing the party was almost done, and you going down and making a scene was also shitty. It was her sweet 16 party, the kid was probably preoccupied with her friends and just trying to have fun and now she will forever be embarrassed and upset when she thinks back to her party. Anyone who says she\u2019ll get over it, sure but she\u2019ll always remember that you ruined it and embarrassed her. I say this as a 35 year old who\u2019s mother embarrassed her at her sweet 16 and I still talk about it with my longtime friends when the subject of me turning 16 gets brought up and guess what, so do my friends that were there, because they remember it too. It\u2019s a 3 minute song, you couldn\u2019t suck it up for 3 minutes so your daughter could just have an easy fun birthday with her friends? I have feeling this wasn\u2019t the only song you were doing this with.", "NAH but I do think you handled this badly. If you'd let the song play, it would have played once and been forgotten. Now it's your daughter's rebellion song, which she will use against you and will find other songs with explicit lyrics knowing you hate that.", "YTA. \nIf you don\u2019t want to listen to that music, fine, but she\u2019s free to listen to whatever she wants.  \n\nBut if it\u2019s soooo important to you, why not mention it before the party? You could\u2019ve just told her to not play any inappropriate songs (which I think is stupid since she\u2019s literally 16). \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for embarrassing her in front of all her friends, and controlling what kind of music she listens to.", "Eh. It sounds like the song was on a playlist and replayed. I agree that it\u2019s a really vulgar song but there was no need to make a scene and embarrass her, especially when we both know they\u2019re all listening to that song when you\u2019re not around.", "Yup. You are the ass! She is 16, that\u2019s what kids listen to. Don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s a while before she talks to you, and even then, you\u2019ve got a lot of repairing to do.", "YTA.\n\nYou daughter isn't going to be a virginal princess until marriage, and literally **everyone** knows what WAP is by this point. At no point in history has there been a sixteen year old who didn't have any kind of sexual impulse/interest. Her friend's comment about \"not liking rap... racist...\" is most likely uncalled for, but you *were* being a jerk.", "YTH So instead of just letting it play once and moving on for the night. You berated your now adult daughter for her choice in music and made an enemy out of her for embarrassing her in front of friends. You've just reignited the terrible teens in her and be prepared for a lot more angst than you would have had.", "Mild YTA. You have the right to set whatever rules you're comfortable with and I think this one is fairly reasonable. However, you should not have called her out in front of her friends. You could have waited just a little longer for them to leave.", "YTA.

It will never work out in your favor.\n\nSigned, a metal head who grew up during the satanic panic and had to constantly defend my music choices to overbearing adults like you.", "YTA. Wait until you find out how many 16 year olds are already having sex, a rap song is nothing.", "YTA, she's old enough to decide her own music. \n\nMore importantly, understand what she is upset about here - it isn't that you didn't let her play the song. She's upset because you've embarassed her in front of her friends. You should have waited until they were gone to talk to her about it, not chew her out in front of them for it.", "YTA for thinking you can control what she or her friends listen to. You are allowed to control what is being played on speaker in your own home, but I don't think you realise you are only setting up for your daughter to know she can't share her interests and thoughts with you or tell you about what happens in her life outside of home with you without you shutting down anything not within your conservative view. She's way to old for you to control what influences her anymore, its more about being open and create a respectful relationship so that you can discuss with her why you don't find certain things respectful or positive, if you try to ban stuff that will rather make you loose the level influence on her.", "YTA it is p controlling to ban a song at a 16yos party. And you could have handled it by telling her off afterwards, rather than embarrassing her.", "NAH.\n\nIt's understandable that you would want the kids to NOT play a song with such explicit lyrics. You were just trying to be a good parent and supervise the kids. \n\nIt's understandable that they would want to play a popular song, especially one considered a bit naughty. The taboo makes it  more coveted.\n\nI'm thinking that if you had just let them play it the one time through, they wouldn't have kept putting it back on. Since she was 16 and not like, 10, that probably would have been the better plan. But I can't call you T A because that song is gross.", "YTA.

Then embarrass her in front of all her peers over a 4 minute song. If it had finished playing the first time it probably wouldn\u2019t have come up again. You made a mountain out of a mole hill.", "INFO: did you establish this boundary before the party? \n\nYou aren't racist for not liking rap.", "YTA. Lighten up buttercup", "Yep. YTA and here\u2019s the thing- all her friends think so too.", "There is a long history of parents being offended by their children\u2019s music \u2026 punk rock, rock & roll, jazz.. even the waltz was considered controversial in its day. \n\nIf your daughter was playing this alone by herself you would be right to tell her you don\u2019t want to hear this song in your house. \n\nHowever **YTA** for humiliating her her in front of her friends.  That will stay with her for a long time.", "YTA. It\u2019s just a pop song. She\u2019s 16. It\u2019s a party. Get over it. I remember when I was a kid one my friends could listen to The Bare Naked Ladies because of the band name. Do I remember her name? No. But I remember what shit parents she had. That\u2019s you. You and her will be remembered as the embarrassment of policing that shit at 16.", "Maybe this is just because my parents weren\u2019t strict about the kind of music I listened to, but personally I think YTA. When I went to friends\u2019 parties in high school, their parents never told them what music they couldn\u2019t play.\n\nYour daughter will still listen to this music regardless of whether or not you allow it. She has the opportunity to do it at a party that you\u2019re supervising. All this will make her want to do is go to parties elsewhere.", "NTA, you\u2019re parenting, but also she is a teen and WAP is popular. You should have stated the expectation of no vulgar lyrics beforehand, but she also shouldn\u2019t have tried to play it after you said no.", "NAH except daughter\u2019s friend, who is very rude. \n\nIt\u2019s OP\u2019s home, the daughter is a minor, yes it is OP\u2019s boundary to set. Of course, young people are developmentally appropriately testing boundaries and developing self identity- daughter is not wrong for playing the song initially. It\u2019s also not a question of policing what OP\u2019s daughter listens to privately. This is about setting boundaries around what is setting the tone for a gathering set in OP\u2019s home. It\u2019s okay for OP to decide that they\u2019re not comfortable with that tone when they\u2019re the legal guardian chaperoning a group of minors. \n\n\nWhat caught my attention is a few details \n\n-OP trusts their daughter, and yet daughter directly disregarded OP\u2019s requests about not playing WAP repeatedly \n\n-upon the boundary being set, one of OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s peers suggests that OP is racist for not wanting this music on. \n\n\nTo me, it seems like OP\u2019s daughter was dealing with peer pressure from a bully. It would be worth it for OP to speak to her daughter about that- I can totally see how from the daughter\u2019s perspective, she just wants to be cool and fit in with her \u201cfriends\u201d, so OP\u2019s PG rules feel insufferably stifling and lame and uncool, and she probably feels very embarrassed. On top of that she might now have to deal with comments or rumors that her mom is racist- especially in this day and age that could be a lot to handle at 16! OP just needs to figure out how to support her daughter.", "NTA\nThis is hilarious, you\u2019re now an embarrassing parent, congratulations!", "YTA\n\nStop mollycoddling her, she\u2019s 16 they listen to shit like that whether you like it or not.\n\nTake the stick out your arse and just let them get on with things.", "YTA. \n\nIt's one stupid song, and it's not like it'll influence them that much -- I guarantee some of your daughter's friends are already sexually active. If you had let the song play the first time through, I bet you wouldn't have heard it again that evening. But knowing teens, I'm confident that one of her friends decided to keep putting WAP on the play queue BECAUSE you complained the first time. And that's not your daughter's fault. \n\nYou've condemned your daughter to a reputation that will ensure she never shares anything with you that you might consider \"unsavory.\" Expect her to now spend more time out of the house, less time communicating with you, and to attend a college far away from where you live.", "Yta.", "YTA. This was a dumb thing to ruin your relationship with your daughter over.

I can guarantee you every single kid at that party has heard that song before and likely worse songs. You embarrassed your daughter at her 16th birthday party. I\u2019m a parent (my oldest is a toddler) but I can\u2019t even imagine dictating what type of music they listen to in our home. If they were blasting it while I had company over or something to that effect, perhaps that\u2019s different. But for their own birthday? Who cares. \n\nIf you felt that strongly about it you could have pulled her aside quietly and talked to her. You didn\u2019t need to unplug the music in front of her friends.", "Yta. Yeah, it's your house, and you don't want to hear it, and that's valid, but it's not the point. She just wants to bump a popular song with her friends at her party, which you agreed could be hosted at your house. Regardless of the song's sexual content (which teenagers are exposed to anyways, I imagine she has a smartphone?), it's the most harmless thing she could have tried to do in your home, and you publicly shot it down.

There's worse ways it could have gone sideways, even with adults supervising.\n\nAnd I agree with your comments about pop music. If you actually pay attention to the lyrics, even a lot of mainstream pop music as far back as the '70s (if not further) is rather heavy on sexual inuendo, if not outright raunchy.
