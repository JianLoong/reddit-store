{"id": 18733, "submission_id": "13xrqli", "title": "AITA for yelling at my son after he damaged my car", "selftext": "Earlier this year, I (M49) bought a Ford Mustang, which I absolutely love. My wife (F46) was never too fond of the car, but my son (M17) loves it, probably even more than I do.\n\nA few days ago, my wife and I had to leave town to visit her aunt (F78), who has been ill. My son has driven the Mustang before (but only under my supervision previously) and knows he isn't allowed to drive it if I'm not around.\n\nAfter we came back (we were gone for two days) (this was yesterday), we arrived home. I went to wash up in the bathroom, and when I came out, my wife and son were both waiting for me. My wife told me that while I was in the bathroom, our son told her that he took the Mustang for a drive with his friends (while we were out of town) and slightly damaged it.\n\nI felt very betrayed and told my son that he knew he wasn't allowed to drive it on his own (for this exact reason), and he apologized, mentioning that the damage is very light.\n\nI went to check the car and saw that the front right wheel was slightly bent, with damage to the bumper and headlight (and I suspect their might be some damage underneath the car). I went back inside the house and yelled at my son, expressing how he lied about the damage and called him an idiot. Then, I asked him how exactly the damage happened, and he told me that he went for a drive with his friends, and they wanted to see how the car drove.\n\nI told my son that he's the least intelligent member of his friend group and that they took advantage of that. I also informed him that he'll be responsible for paying off the car's damage. At this point, he became quiet, avoiding eye contact. I didn't speak with him for the rest of the day, and he continued avoiding eye contact.\n\nThat evening, my wife told me that I was being way too harsh and that he's upset. She suggested I talk to him more gently before bed so that he doesn't resent me. I replied that I've already said everything I wanted to say and that if she wants to talk to him, she can. She then expressed that my reaction has been disproportionate and that I shouldn't place such a large value on something that can be repaired. Feeling exhausted and frustrated, I said goodnight to her and went to bed. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit - While I was (and still am) angry about him damaging the car. I mainly anger about how he broke my trust and could have gotten himself killed or arrested just to impress other people\n\nUPDATE - My son came back from school and I sat him down for a talk. I told him that I did not think he was an idiot, but reiterated that his actions that day were dumb. I then asked him to tell me what exactly happened, and I would remain silent the entire time he narrates.\n\nHe told me that 3 of friends came over to hang out. After a while they asked to check out the car. My son showed them the car and even started it up and revved it a few times for them (I'm totally fine with). One friend (who kinda always struck me as being a bit of a little shit lets call him Sam) suggest they go for a drive. While son did initially refuse they kept pestering him until he agreed.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, Sam then starts asks my son to start driving more aggressively and unfortunately my son agreed and ended up hitting a curb. They drive home (my son told me that Sam was laughing the entire ride back).\n\nI also learned that Sam has been telling people at school to the point of during one class (which Sam is also in), when my son was using a computer the teacher said something like \u201cDon't wreck it like you did your dad's car\u201d", "created_utc": 1685649726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xrqli/aita_for_yelling_at_my_son_after_he_damaged_my_car/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The lesson - taking responsibility for your actions.  Have a man to man and not a \"I'm pissed and said everything I was going to say\" moment.  Listen to what he has to say.  Teach him about responsibility and keeping your word and what it means to make it right.  Maybe set up a payment plan or a work it off plan.  Don't blow this out of the water over a car, which your wife is correct, that can be repaired.  If you go too hard or too distant, then there will be no repairing the relationship.  Your son succeeding in life is 1000X more important.", "NTA - teens and muscle cars can be fatal. He was hot rodding and showing off is why there was an accident. Hope he learns the leason and I am sure you learned keep the keys with you", "I would say you are not the ah for getting mad at a teenager who did something he shouldn\u2019t do, but YTA for calling him an idiot and the least intelligent person in his friend group. Those are remarks a teenager and a person in general carries with him for the rest of his life.\n\nI suggest you talk to your son about his wrongdoings and yours. This way, he might understand that people (even his dad) make mistakes in the moment, but that everyone always has to at least try and correct them. You correct your mistake, he sees you correcting your mistake, you be a good and realistic role model and he tries to correct his mistake.", "Well, maybe you shouldn't have called him an idiot or said he was the least intelligent of his friends, but I'd say NTA. On some level he has to understand how upset you are in his reckless behavior and then minimizing the damage. It would be good to go back and apologize and say you wish you would have responded better. You should hold him responsible to pay for the damage though. When I was younger , I broke  my parent's bed......and they drove me to the local high schools and had me collect cans after their sporting events and recycle them for money til I paid for a new bed. I learned the value of respecting people's stuff after that", "NTA. He knew the rules and broke your trust. He should be made to pay for the damages and no driving for a long time", "NTA. Your kid could have killed someone. What did he actually hit?", "YTA. Not for \"yelling at my son after he damaged my car\", but for the things you said. \"called him an idiot\", \"I told my son that he's the least intelligent member of his friend group\", \"I told him that like a toddler we'll have to start hiding things from him or else he'll break them\". Because of some damage to a car, you want to completely destroy him as a person, that's what makes you the asshole.\n\nI have 2 teenage boys that are driving age, and a 20 year old boy. Yeah, they can do things that are completely idiotic. But you know what doesn't help? Telling them they are completely idiotic and teaching them that's all they can expect from themselves, and that's all we, as parents, can expect from them. That's the easiest way to ensure they will never learn and become better people.\n\nThere are so many ways you could have punished him and used this as a way to teach and help him to grow. Instead, you worked to make him into a worse person.", "NTA he could have killed someone", "YTA. The name calling and comment about his intelligence was uncalled for, and he will remember that for life. \nBut your wife saying that it occurred while you were \"in the bathroom\", instead of \"the 2 days you were gone\" sounds like a lie.", "NTA he is an idiot and needs to face consequences for first breaking your trust to not take the car, and then he needs to pay back every cent it costs to fix. All these other people calling you Y T A don\u2019t live in reality and want to make you the bad guy since they aren\u2019t footing the bill for the repair.", "NTA doesn't seem like this is the first time your son has pulled a stupid stunt to impress his friends.", "NTA", "NTA. That's terrifying. Teenagers always want to show off. My cousin wrecked his father's muscle car years ago when the licenses were printed on paper and my uncle took the license and ripped it to shreds. You were pretty harsh though, so maybe when you're calmer you could explain that the anger came from fear, and of course, the betrayal of trust.  .. do you know yet what was damaged underneath?", "I hate yelling. I really do. But, your son actually earned your outrage. He lied and hopefully he learns from underselling the problem after he literally took your car without permission.\n\n He'll live. Hopefully, he'll even improve in the future.\n\nNTA. I can think of much worse discipline than yelling. (I just disapprove of it because it represents that you've lost control. That makes it easier for people to ignore what you're actually saying to them. They feel you don't deserve to be taken seriously because you've lost control. Dumb? Yes. Yelling becomes a red herring.)", "NTA. Your edit is exactly the point. While the damage can be fixed it could have been SO MUCH WORSE. Technically he stole a vehicle, was in possession of a stolen vehicle and felony damage of property. He could have killed himself and everyone in the car not to mention anyone else on the road. Your wife is underreacting. That said, the comment about him being the least intelligent of his friends was uncalled for. It's one thing to call him stupid for doing stupid shit, it's another to compare his intelligence to his peers.", "NTA he knew the rules and disrespected them just to show off in front of his friends. However, YTA for leaving the keys somewhere accessible to him... Surely you saw this coming?", "YTA for the way you yelled at your son. \u201cCalled him an idiot\u201d \u201ctold him he\u2019s the least intelligent member of his friend group\u201d. Holy crap you\u2019re an ass. You have every right to be disappointed, feel broken trust, enact consequences, require he work off the damages. ALL of that would be good parenting. Belittling your son, calling him names, putting him down, making sure he knows how small he is\u2026 did it make you feel good to speak to your son like that? Your wife is right, he\u2019s going to resent you\u2026 and if that\u2019s the way you speak to him he SHOULD resent you.", "YTA.\n\nThis: \"I went back inside the house and yelled at my son, expressing how he lied about the damage and called him an idiot\"\n\nAnd this: \"I told my son that he's the least intelligent member of his friend group\" \n\nWTAF.  This is no way to talk to a human being.  I won't explain it to you, because you won't understand, but have fun with more interactions like this, and they're going to get worse, happen more frequently, be more intense and harder for you to control.  He's going to start lying to you.  Also look forward to your son resenting you, hating you and possibly cutting off contact at some point in your lives.  He will also continue to act out, and I wouldn't be surprised if your wife decides to leave you, because you won't listen to her or respect her own parenting instincts.  She can't be the middleman, at least I hope she won't continue to put herself in that position.  \n\nHe actually fessed up and told you he took the car out.  He wanted to be up front and honest with you, and this is how you treat him?  Have funnnnnnn", "ESH but also soft YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to feel how you felt. It\u2019s okay to express you are angry, disappointed, frustrated. It\u2019s not okay to personally insult your son. He did a stupid thing, yes, but teenagers do that, it doesn\u2019t mean he should be personally attacked. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in poverty all of my life, so I understand wanting to keep something you\u2019ve paid a lot of hard earned money for in good condition, and you deserve to have your vehicle respected. I am sorry you did not, but the biggest issue with your sons behavior isn\u2019t that he damaged the car (though yes, he should pay for it, actions have consequences) - it\u2019s that he broke your trust in him (this is the biggest thing) and that he lied about it. \n\nYou need to apologize to your son for losing your temper and saying he is stupid, even though he did a stupid thing. And then you need to orient that conversation about how you had so much trust in your son, that he would respect your things, that you trusted he wouldn\u2019t do anything dangerous without you home. And then tell him that lying to you about it was the very worst thing he could have done. \n\nHowever, this becomes an issue because you\u2019ve now shown him that if he comes to you with the truth, you personally attack him. How likely do you think he will come to you in the future when he\u2019s made a mistake? Can he expect dad to sigh heavily, be angry, but calmly work it out and tell him \u201cthank you for telling me this, but,\u201d ? No, he can\u2019t. So next time, he likely won\u2019t tell you if he\u2019s made a mistake at all. Which is not how a parent should appear to a child. Kids and teens make mistakes, sometimes they need to tell you about those mistakes because they\u2019re not mature enough to handle them, and need your help. \n\nGround him all you want, for taking the car behind your back, require him to pay you back, as he should, but don\u2019t go on leaving him thinking you\u2019ll berate him next time he confesses a big mistake to you. \n\nYou\u2019ve now lost trust in him, because he went behind your back, but he\u2019s also now lost his trust in you, because you personally attacked him. This isn\u2019t good for either of you and you need to have a talk about getting back to a more honest foundation for your relationship.", "YTA!!! Come on dude you have to know you are the asshole. It\u2019s reasonable to be disappointed he lied and disappointed about the damage but insults like calling your kid an idiot or telling him he\u2019s the least intelligent of his friends was never going to be good parenting. Hopefully you can show some maturity and talk to your son like a person who made a bad choice and admit your own mistakes.", "INFO was your son the driver? Can you recoup damages from any of the other participants in the escapade?", "YTA for calling your son dumb and being SO mean about it.  \n\nYou really missed a good parenting opportunity to teach him the value of money, and liability since he\u2019s about to be an adult and should learn how that will apply to him soon. \n\nIt\u2019s completely valid to make him pay you back, but you chose to insult him and make him feel like he can never be honest with you in the future.", "YTA for losing your temper, having him pay the damage is appropriate, you might plan to forgive the last half.", "ESH \n\nHim for damaging the car and not disclosing the extent. You for berating him the way you did. That isn't the way you're supposed to talk to somebody you love. Especially your child.", "ESH. \n\nYour son's lie of omission (not sharing the circumstances of the extent of the damage) is still a lie. Make a mistake? Own it. Lying just makes it worse.\n\nYou overreacted about an item that can be repaired/replaced. He definitely betrayed your trust, and he absolutely needs to pay for the damage to learn his lesson, but yelling doesn't help him learn the lesson.", "YTA\n\nSir, you verbally brutalised your son and hit him in his self-esteem for doing... what 17 years old do. \n\nYou have a teenager . OFCOURSE he will do stupid things and will annoy you, but no need to turn abusive. \n\nThat's just SAD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake sure you apologize to him in time for this to remain a funny story at dinner parties in the future, and not some trauma...", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Your son sucks for crossing the boundary of not driving the car without your permission. However, the way you reacted kind of hints to me that you have a hard time controlling your cool when it comes to events like this. No wonder your son told your wife first, probably out of fear of how you\u2019d react. \n\nThis was a situation where you should\u2019ve walked away to cool down first. Yes, of course the car is damaged and it will be a pain to get fixed, but teaching your son responsibility and making him work to pay for the cost of repair and having a conversation as to why what he did was wrong would\u2019ve been a lot better. Asking him if he was ok and his friends were ok would\u2019ve been better too, I\u2019d hope that would be the priority of concern in the future.", "YTA. If your son is neurotypical, then he has a 17yo brain, and those are impulsive. NT folks finish their brain development at age 25. If your son has ADHD, his impulse control/executive function is up to three years behind.\n\nYou\u2019re 49. You have the ability to take a moment before you blow up your relationship over a bad choice and a lie. He went to his mother first because he already has experience with you being the AH when he messes up.\n\nYou can fix this, starting with a frank apology to him. You can go to therapy for yourself and ask your wife and son to go to family therapy. You can break this pattern before you break him. I believe you can become NTA.", "ESH. Although it could\u2019ve been on a calmer tone I do agree that he has to assume the consequences of his actions. Calling him an idiot might not be the best way to communicate though. Teens make mistakes. I\u2019m sure he understood that it was a mistake and will learn from that.", "YTA. You attacked his self esteem.", "YTA, not for yelling at your son, but for purposefully talking down on and insulting your son. Did it make you feel better about the situation by calling you\u2019re son \u201cthe dumbest member of his friend group\u201d? Did it repair the damage to call him an idiot? All you\u2019ve got now is a son who knows how you really think about him and a damaged car", "ESH.  Him for taking the car when he knew damn well he shouldn't have, and then lying about the damage.  You for calling him stupid.  Your wife for downplaying what he did as just something that can be fixed when the damage to the car isn't the main problem.", "Being angry and holding him responsible are both reasonable responses, he's old enough to know better and be held accountable. You're right that he could have been hurt or hurt others and that's worth being upset about.\n\nAs others have pointed out though the stuff you said to him was pretty miserable. He was willing to come out and tell the truth knowing there would be consequences and you pretty much shoved that in his face. He's going to be less trusting and less forthcoming in the future because of how you reacted. YTA for that, both to him and yourself.\n\nMake it right and apologize to him for what you said. Keep the punishments in place of course but admit what you said was wrong.", "YTA, we are supposed to teach and build up our children, you verbally obliterated him. That did not need to be done.", "YTA you just showed him a stupid car is more important to you than your own son", "YTA, not for being upset, but for calling your child an idiot and \u201cthe least intelligent member of his friend group\u201d. That kind of insult sticks with a kid, and he will remember you saying that until the day he dies. \n\nThe kid is embarrassed, he knows what he did was wrong, he knows he has to pay. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s just a car. Make sure you have a relationship with your son, because he\u2019s worth a damn lot more than a mustang.", "YTA. nice edit. During your humiliating and degrading rant at your already sorry son, did you even once express concern for his safety or wellbeing? \n\nHe knows he messed up. But now he knows his dad cares more about a car than his sons well-being. \n\nAt 17 this kids brain isn\u2019t done growing. Have some empty for his stupid mistake. He can suffer the consequences of his decisions with the shame.", "YTA. It's a stupid piece of metal and he's your SON. I'd prepare to not hear from him anymore once he leaves your home.", "INFO: What year was the mustang?
