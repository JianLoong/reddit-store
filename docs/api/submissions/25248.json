If you don't think this woman is worth having in your life, and your boyfriend doesn't either, than that's reason enough to say no. Also, I'm a little bothered how this is framed as a you choice where you're taking all of the fault, because your boyfriend absolutely is an active party here and has clearly demonstrate a lack of comfort in this womans presence.\n\nI know that I wouldn't say, \"yeah we'll reject this person who kept grabbing and stroking **me**, without my consent, because that made **you** uncomfortable.\" I deserve to be comfortable around people, and so does your boyfriend.\n\nThis isn't \"you\" deciding you don't wanna be around her this is a \"we\" situation and you **both** want nothing to do with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA- She has your number I'm assuming.  If she wanted to start a new relationship with you and your boyfriend she could reach out and apologize to you.\n\nYou can tell your sister that there's just too much bad blood between you all.  Make sure you're a solid United front with your partner and are both in agreement.\n\nIf she can't be bothered to apologize to you, then you really can't be bothered to start a new friendship", "NTA. Sounds like shes been harassing your bf for a long time. Yanking and stroking him and making him uncomfortable is unacceptable. You need to have a conversation with your sister about how she treats the both of you. Neither of you need or should be around this person.", "ESH This is why people should diversify their friend groups and not still be hanging with their high school crew at 30.
