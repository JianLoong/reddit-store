Not wanting religion in your life is absolutely your right, but to go as far as to not allow her to wear jewelry that is important to her personal beliefs and restricting her sharing what is happening in her life seems to be taking it too far. Some of the restrictions are completely reasonable like telling her not to invite you to church anymore or not wanting proselytizing or praying in your home.

Why would you think my belief on a God is a direct attack towards someone I love? 2. Why do you make my religion a \"you problem\"? Like whether I talk or belief in upstairs daddy or not doesn't have any effect in those who surround me. And 3.

You see other religions as fine -- maybe as quirky cultural artifacts, sometimes even as helpful practices. You'd never be so rude as to tell a Jewish person to keep their Jewishness out of your home. You wouldn't dream of mocking a Muslim person for refusing to eat bacon. You might even be okay with displaying Buddhist prayer flags or \"New Age\" crystals and statues, because to you, those aren't about religion, they're about the aesthetic.\n\nHowever, you respond to any trappings of Christianity like they're a personal attack against you. You don't have a space in your brain for the idea that people might be practicing Christianity in good faith (pun unintended). You see things like cross necklaces and stories about what happened at church as \"gratuitous,\" because deep down, you don't believe that people would ever do those things sincerely. If anything, you treat visible Christianity as a kind of virtue-signaling -- things that people do to show they're better than others, not things they do because you'd actually believe it (as opposed to, say, what your Muslim friends do).\n\nRight now, you're responding to your mom like she's wearing that cross necklace specifically to hurt you, or like she's telling those stories about the church-happening events in her life just to spite you. And she may well be! But also, I think that's just what her life is like. It's just that her life also activates a trauma response in you, and that's not fun.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think you want to make your home a \"no-religion zone\" so much as you want your mom to STFU. Which is a fine thing to want! Honestly, I get it. I just think that instead of making lofty proclamations, it's better if you just tell your mom that what she's doing is hurting you, and that you're not obligated to let someone in your house who hurts you or your partner. As long as you play this up like a blanket \"religion ban\" but let non-Christian religious stuff in your home, she's going to have ammunition to call you a hypocrite. You don't have to care about that accusation, but from the fact you posted here, it seems you do.\n\nI think some of this, too, is going to involve your having to sort through your own responses to her behavior.

But we prioritize our relationships with our parents, especially our mom. Being so involved in church and being a minister cut off a lot of socializing for our mom so she doesn't always have a lot to talk about besides church activities. And being a woman in church creates a lot of emotional stress that many men don't experience. or at least not in the same ways.

I understand that you mom may not like it but she isn\u2019t the one with clear trauma here.  \n\nIt might help to explain to your mom that you love her & want her in your life, and that\u2019s why you are asking her to respect your GF\u2019s triggers from an abusive past & your preferences.  It\u2019s not a lot to ask. You aren\u2019t asking your mom to give up her beliefs or religion, just to stop overtly practicing it when in your home.", "NTA", "NTA. I also grew up catholic, christianity isn't marginalized, being LGBT is. your mother is actively ignoring the harm the church has done to you and your girlfriend", "NTA. I get it. My mom kidnapped me when I was a kid and took me to cultists, so I am not the biggest fan of religion. It's your house, so protect your peace because outside of your home, no one will. At least have this one space free.", "NTA you are protecting yourselves from hate! Well done OP", "NTA, you have been traumatized by religion and it is perfectly reasonable not have any religous items around that may trigger anytype of anxiety.", "NTA my house is the same my partners parents are religious he's not really. Mine aren't really religious they left it up to le and my siblings if we wanted to be baptized, christened e.t.c. You can be whatever religion you want but this is my place.", "NTA\n\nYour home should feel like your safe haven. Anything associated with something traumatic is not welcome.\n\nI'm assuming you are trying to remove any and all opportunities for it to be welcomed into your home as that can be a slippery slope. People with strong beliefs tend to need stronger boundaries. You know the situation best. Just remember, people with normal, healthy relationships can't imagine having to do things like this because they don't have to, not because it's wrong.", "NTA\n\nas someone from outside of the USA it\u2018s wild to me that your mother can only talk about 20% of her life if she has to leave religion and church out of it. The necklace bit is quite petty and seemingly random, but then again so are the rules in religious households so you are just giving her a taste of her own crap.\n\nI do think you are kind of an A to yourself though as you don\u2018t seem to be keeping in touch with her for any other reason than formality/obligation. It would probably allow you to heal much better if you were to allow yourself to step away from that relationship for a while.", "As a Catholic, I support you fully.  They should respect the laws of the land. I am not going to preach to you but the truth is God would want you to protect your peace and heal. Noone ever died from not wearing a cross or rosary. None of the posturing we do in the name of faith will grant us salvation, only being good people will.", "NTA- you are right. There is no hypocrisy on your part.\n\nYour have the right to make your home a completely secular space and all visitors choose to enter having accepted these terms or stay away rejecting the terms. \n\nYour mother is TA and very fortunate that you are willing to interact with her and allow her into your home if she complies with your house rules. I wouldn't, don't allow any religious preaching or zealots to come to my home.\n\nI agree with you, I'm catholic and NC with all my living ancestors.", "You are NTA and all the comments saying you are T A are shocking me. You and your partner both have a lot of religious trauma. I grew up in a cult and sometimes just thinking about my past can give me an anxiety attack where I can't breathe properly. Your mother is lucky she's still part of your life in the first place and needs to get a grip on how badly intense religious settings can hurt people, including her own daughter. It's your home and you and your partner should feel safe in it.", "NTA. Think of this situation as a pendulum swing. Your GF\u2019s family took religion pendulum to the ugly, hurtful extreme. It is no wonder that it swings to the no religion, no religious symbols, not religious talk or references at all.  While your mom\u2019s religious pendulum didn\u2019t swing as high, it was definitely on the \u201c you are not fully okay without God (as I define *him*)\u201d side.  Your first home, just for the two of you. Your safe place.\n\nRight now, the pendulum looks and feels dangerous.  Any glimpse of the religion side is an active threat. So you don\u2019t tolerate it in your home.  (This could be a way to explain it your mom - you know her, you and your partners comfort level, so you will know best.)\n\nIn time, you may see the pendulum differently, keeping the hateful, harmful out, and at the same time recognize that where someone else is on that arc is about them living their life, and presents no threat to you living your lives.  Or not.  It is up to you both.  \n\nYou are where you are. And in your own home, you have every right to protect that.", "NTA and thank you, I\u2019m stealing this idea!", "NTA even if you are using it for revenge it is in your right because you are extremely traumatized from religion being shoved down your throats as well as being abused in the name of god. Which is BS. You have every right to have your peace and if something or someone disrupts that peace you also have every right to banish it.", "Nta because those are the rules in your house. Despite what they are saying, you have the right to do whatever in your home. Your not pushing how you feel or being vindictive, your just standing up for yourself bro", "Nta. \n\nReligion and its followers have done horrendous things to others since the dawn of time. \n\nSetting boundaries due to ptsd is good for better mental health. \n\nShe can hide her religious artifacts at your home. (I am almost positive that the phrase, \u201cmy house my rules\u201d was issued in the past and it certainly fits this situation in the present)", "NTA\nYour house your rules. Overly religious people have to learn that there are increasingly more people uninterested in it.  It used to be that in polite company one did not discuss religion or politics. Even my very religious Catholic house we did not discuss religion except for saying grace before meals and mass every Sunday and holidays. It would have been weird to talk about anything else at home. You do you.", "I was with you until you got to her necklace.  That's just too much.  \n\nYTA", "Yta and a hypocrite!", "YTA for not being honest and claiming your house is a no-religion space when what you actually mean is that it's a no Christianity space.", "If you don\u2019t want her  religiousness in your space don\u2019t invite her there and just meet in neutral ground.", "YTA because you're going way overboard on your \"rules\"... seemingly just to make a point. She can't tell a story about what happened at church or wear a cross necklace? Come on", "YTA \n\nJust go NC with your mother, and stop being passive about it", "ESH. I was with you until covering her necklace. I don\u2019t see the need for anyone to cover their jewelry. And is she not allowed to talk about things that happened at church at all, or just religious things from church?", "YTA", "YTA", "NTA.\n\nBased on my life experiences wearing a pentagram as Satanist, a huge majority of the people calling OP an asshole are fucking hypocrites who would absolutely would tell me to take off my necklace in their home because it offends them.   \n\nA cross is a sincere and harmless symbol of my faith, but a pentagram is a symbol of evil black magic that cannot be tolerated.  It's rules for thee, but not for me, in classic christian fashion.", "And no stories about her Christian friends/church. Like what if you asked \u201cwhat did you do yesterday?\u201d She can\u2019t say I went to church?", "I don't see why she can't silently say it in her head, or go to another room?

My mother hates that, because all her friends are churchgoers and 80% of her stories relate to something happening in church\n\nMaybe OP doesn't want to hear stories about people who also judge her for having a gay relationship? People who her mother gets along with will most likely be the same people who make her feel like shit", "> I have pretty strong feelings about preventing personal religious expression...\n\nI do too - in public.  This is OP's private home.", "Yep. I said this in a different comment thread but I think OP is just in a place where they're not ready to bite the bullet and cut mom out. I definitely feel for them. I don't want to minimize their religious trauma, but to ban all discussions of religion is extremely limiting. I had some friends over last week and while I'm not Jewish it was really cool hearing them talking about the different ways their families celebrate. Passover. OP would be a real jerk to shut that down.\n\nBut we all know they probably wouldn't do that to their friends. This is about Mom. OP really would do well to be honest with themselves.", "You also don't have to wear pride things. And for a lot of cultures religion is intertwined with their heritage.", "While I see your point, those people do also unironically need to talk to someone about why they think someone wearing a star in their house will summon satan, because that\u2019s not a healthy amount of fear to ascribe to a shape. It can be normalized or trauma informed, but it\u2019s not healthy.", "You're entitled to believe what you believe, and everyone else is entitled to have their own opinions about what you believe.", "I agree when it comes to the religions that the \"some\" qualifier actually applies to. In America, Muslims and Christians may both hate that I'm gay, but only one of those makes up 90% of our government, legislates my rights away based on that religion, has extreme control over public discourse, have attacked me personally, preaches that people I love need to be exterminated or people like me need to be \"lined up against the wall and shot in the back of the head\", and makes up most of my street, city, county, and state.\n\nI understand that \"othering\" is bad, but we're butting up against the paradox of tolerance here. Gay people don't hate religion because they hate religion, they are terrified because of the constant, public, escalating violent rhetoric from places of power that \"good Christians\" aren't standing up to in any meaningful way. The two are not equal. This \"don't label the group\" perspective only serves to protect those causing harm. Black people who are terrified of police aren't doing the same thing to police by \"discriminating\" against them. Jews weren't just as bad as Nazis for \"generalizing the whole group\". Power and harm matter, and it's literally impossible to fight back against fascist, hateful groups without identifying that group as the group causing harm. Treating that as an equal wrong guarantees that harm will escalate.", "OP's mother's beliefs aren't the issue.  Her behavior is the issue.  She wants to promote her religion in OP's home, and OP doesn't have to allow that.", "She's not being forced.  She doesn't have to come over.", "No one is forcing mom to come there. It's a private home, not a public building or setting and mom doesn't live there. If you want to enforce your own religious standard in someone else's home... well, that exactly what is wrong with way too many religious people.\n\nAlso considering that both OP and their partner are women, no hijabi would have a problem with removing it in that private space. Methinks you do not know the rules concerning wearing a hijab but are just throwing a tantrum because someone religious was told no to something they wanted.", "I\u2019m a lesbian secular humanist so please stay away from me with both. /s", "And in America, churches actively work against social help for the needy \"because that's the church's role\" (of course, they're fine with government assuming the church's role of othering & punishing \"sinners\", just not helping people, but I digress). It's framed as the church \"wanting to help\" but really it's a way to maintain control over who they deem worthy of help and a way to capitalize on the suffering of people to indoctrinate them. The church *wants* suffering because happy, healthy, cared for people are less likely to buy in to their religion. It's the same as abusive people looking for vulnerable targets. Suffering people are more vulnerable to shame, guilt, and fear and are desperate for help.", "and that's what raised all the money", "> Edit: to further clarify, I don't think they're being an asshole by claiming it's a blanket ban when dealing with someone who doesn't like being told no.\n\nExcept we aren't OP's mother and were asked if a blanket ban on everyone makes them an asshole.  \n\nAs far as OP's mother goes, I don't care about her feelings, although suspect claiming this isn't personal when it is will just cause more issues.", "I agree!", "OP is a woman.", "The crusades were just \"regular warfare\" under a religious banner during the timeframe. Nothing really bad or brutal about it.\n\nDoesn't compare to the child rape dossiers, the colonization and extermination of the Americas and it's native peoples.", "The necklace thing is plain hilarious.

It\u2019s just not the same, by any stretch.", "People obviously have the right to believe whatever they want, but... what's up with queer Christians?

They want to drastically limit their mother in their life, and that's totally fine. The overabundance of religious rules just seems to be a way of limiting mom exposure without pulling the plug.", "Eh, I say fuck being better. It's not on an abuse victim to be soft with their abuser. If they can't follow the boundaries, then they can meet outside of their home (if at all). \nSometimes the feeling of control in your own space is needed, especially when it was taken away very purposefully in the past.", "Were you ever indoctrinated in a religion or do you speak as someone who has been a life-long atheist? There is a big difference. I was indoctrinated as a child and it\u2019s effects have been far flung and devastating for me in so many ways. \n\nPeople affected by religious trauma also have their triggers. And just like CPTSD, you manage the triggers around you the best you can. I manage mine most of the time quite well. Recently a new one came up\u2026a street preacher who preaches homophobia, misogyny and hate at the crosswalk between my workplaces. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just any cross. This is a cross on the neck of a woman who was a huge part of the abuse OP suffered. This is a cross on the neck of a woman who refuses to acknowledge that abuse and then further pressures OP to once again be a part of that abusive environment. This isn\u2019t a cross on a strangers neck walking down the street. This is a cross on an abuser\u2019s neck in her safe space. \n\nI know from my own experience that it\u2019s extremely difficult to cut parental ties even when the reasons are numerous and pertain to abuse. OP is managing the situation the best she knows how and like many of us will either live to regret continuing life with her abuser in the picture or will one day remove them from the picture entirely.", "You absolutely can but that wasn\u2019t the question. The question here is wether you are an asshole or not", "Yeah \"don't tell any stories that mention church\" really is a very big ask. It doesn't sound like she's trying to proselytize or pressure. It sounds like she's a gregarious person being asked to censor herself so hard (we all have to censor ourselves but 80% is a lot!) that she feels off-balance continually.\n\nI also hear the people who say the extent of the GF's trauma may be extreme enough to need extreme measures--it really can be like that. The mom coming to truly understand that would help, a sort of meeting in the middle. That may be possible or it may not. OP acknowledging to her mom that she knows the measures are extreme might be a help toward whatever mutual understanding can be had.", "But if OP\u2019s girlfriend has trauma relating to church, then it\u2019s even worse of the mom to deliberately trigger the girlfriend just so she can talk about her potato salad.
