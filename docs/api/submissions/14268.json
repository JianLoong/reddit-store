We're very exited to make our apartment into our own space, since for both of us this is the first home we've had without sharing with anyone else.\n\nMy mother (and my late father) is rabidly catholic. I was raised catholic growing up, church every sunday, praying before every meal and snack, blah blah blah. I refused to do confirmation, which enraged my mother but she backed off after the priest told her that was my right. She \"didn't approve\" of me being bi (which is weird, she surprisingly is ok with gay people) and still dragged me to church hoping I'd grow out of it.\n\nLong story short I moved out at 18, and have kept a respectfully distant relationship with her. She's mellowed a bit in her age, but she still tries to invite me to church every week, even after I told her plainly to cut that out. She's respectful to my girlfriend, mostly because I will choose her over my mother if it comes to that, and it nearly did when she accused my girlfriend of being a predator when we met due to our age gap.\n\nMy girlfriend has an even more traumatic past with religion. When she was outed at 12, her parents abused her until she was 18, then disowned her. The entire time using bible quotes and \"gods mission\" as an excuse. She still believes in A god, just not in religion or worship, which I respect. With all our trauma about religion, we decided to make the place into a no-religion space.\n\nThat means no praying, no religious symbols of any kind, no proselytizing, no talking about religious settings. My mother hates that, because all her friends are churchgoers and 80% of her stories relate to something happening in church. She also gets mad that we make her take off or cover her cross necklace, as are the rules. She claims we're being hypocrites, to which I told her she's lucky to be in my life at all.

Not wanting religion in your life is absolutely your right, but to go as far as to not allow her to wear jewelry that is important to her personal beliefs and restricting her sharing what is happening in her life seems to be taking it too far. Some of the restrictions are completely reasonable like telling her not to invite you to church anymore or not wanting proselytizing or praying in your home.

Why would you think my belief on a God is a direct attack towards someone I love? 2. Why do you make my religion a \"you problem\"? Like whether I talk or belief in upstairs daddy or not doesn't have any effect in those who surround me. And 3.

We can think the rules are unreasonable, but it's not like the mom has a right to be there, so if she doesn't want to follow the rules, she just doesn't come over.", "good point", "A lot of people are more ok with other religions than the one they were abused by growing up.

I'm typically more ok with non catholic churches than catholic ones, because I wad raised in the catholic church and saw how horrible it was.", "Which religion do they associate with their abuse- if it\u2019s Christian phrases and crosses then a hijab wouldn\u2019t bother them.\n\nIf they were beaten regularly for refusing to wear a hijab and that was a trigger for PTSD then that\u2019s what they\u2019d avoid seeing in their home. \n\nNo hypocrisy involved.", "It's not hypocritical.  Adherents of Islam did not traumatize OP and her GF in the name of Allah.", "Eh, OP doesn't have trauma connected to a hijab. They do have trauma related to Christian theology.

Yes, they're both loud noises, but only one is a trigger.", "And just like that we moved into YTA", "This is hypocritical.\n\nYour mother wears her cross as a religious garment/marking  significant to her religion, in the same way a Sikh person wears a turban m, or a Muslim wears a hijab or burqa. \n\nYou are being intolerant of her, based on her religious beliefs. Either you ask ALL of your religious friends & family to remove outward signs of their religions, ie have the same standards for everyone and don't discriminate, or be intolerant and target your mother.", "Have you both considered therapy? This response shows it's not religious trauma but parental homophobia. You think that by banning all typical Christian or Catholic symbols from your home you'll finally get one back on them because those symbols and conversations mean something to them and you are now finally in the position to exert the right over them. \n\nPerhaps either LC or NC while you undergo years of therapy would be great.", "So it\u2019s just your mum and your family?", "I mean, whether it was gratuitous or not. It is her clothes and her jewellery. Controlling that doesn't make sense at all.", "oh ok, see that is super hypocritical. I was on your side until this. YTA. Wanting religious talk and whatnot to be banned is fine, but your mom isn't allowed a necklace, but everyone else is? You're a hypocrite. I'm sorry for your religious trauma, but either ban your mother outright or seek therapy.", "Okay, I need to preface this by saying that one, I'm queer, and two, I teach in a Religious Studies department at a (secular) university:\n\nThis is actually a response you see with a not-small number of queer people who have religious trauma connected to Christianity in particular. You see other religions as fine -- maybe as quirky cultural artifacts, sometimes even as helpful practices. You'd never be so rude as to tell a Jewish person to keep their Jewishness out of your home. You wouldn't dream of mocking a Muslim person for refusing to eat bacon. You might even be okay with displaying Buddhist prayer flags or \"New Age\" crystals and statues, because to you, those aren't about religion, they're about the aesthetic.\n\nHowever, you respond to any trappings of Christianity like they're a personal attack against you. You don't have a space in your brain for the idea that people might be practicing Christianity in good faith (pun unintended). You see things like cross necklaces and stories about what happened at church as \"gratuitous,\" because deep down, you don't believe that people would ever do those things sincerely. If anything, you treat visible Christianity as a kind of virtue-signaling -- things that people do to show they're better than others, not things they do because you'd actually believe it (as opposed to, say, what your Muslim friends do).\n\nRight now, you're responding to your mom like she's wearing that cross necklace specifically to hurt you, or like she's telling those stories about the church-happening events in her life just to spite you. And she may well be! But also, I think that's just what her life is like. It's just that her life also activates a trauma response in you, and that's not fun.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think you want to make your home a \"no-religion zone\" so much as you want your mom to STFU. Which is a fine thing to want! Honestly, I get it. I just think that instead of making lofty proclamations, it's better if you just tell your mom that what she's doing is hurting you, and that you're not obligated to let someone in your house who hurts you or your partner. As long as you play this up like a blanket \"religion ban\" but let non-Christian religious stuff in your home, she's going to have ammunition to call you a hypocrite. You don't have to care about that accusation, but from the fact you posted here, it seems you do.\n\nI think some of this, too, is going to involve your having to sort through your own responses to her behavior. If she shuts up about the church stuff but keeps wearing the necklace, is that okay with you? Can you tell the difference between when she's actively trying to get your goat, and when she's just talking about the most important thing that happened to her last week? Do you actually think that a relationship with her is worth it?\n\nThese are questions you'll have to tackle offline. I wish you and your partner the best in deciding the best way to handle this situation.", "Op wants to enforce a no Christianity stuff ban in their house but for some reason doesn't want to just admit that, and instead are inventing all these reasons why some things are ok but others are not.

It\u2019s a need versus preference.\n\nI still think OP is TA, but I actually disagree with everyone else saying that cross thing is the worst part. The not talking about church thing is way worse to me if it really includes the slightest tangential mention of church. Like, you\u2019re really going to throw mom out of your house because she tells a story that includes \u201cI was talking to Betsy, you know the one from church\u201d or talks about how Sally made a good potato salad for the church potluck?", "I'd say not talking about it, at least around the gf is fine because she literally was abused and disowned. Other than that yeah, it's extreme and kind of ironic. The mother sounds like the main issue.", "Will she ask a muslim women to remove her hijab inside her house? Or a sikh man to remove his turban?", "A mosque is not the same as a private dwelling.", "If they were asking a Muslim friend to remove their head covering for the same reason (not wanting to have a visual representation of religion in their space), would that be okay?", "And if hating religion is OP's identity isn't that sad too?", "So someone\u2019s hobby can be their identity, or being \u201ca mother\u201d can be their identity , but this woman\u2019s faith can\u2019t be get identity?

It's not mandatory in *any* denomination. It's just that people like wearing it.\n\nAnd in general, I'm all for freedom of choice, and I do think OP needs to think carefully about how much she and her girlfriend can control what other people do, but the fact remains that banning nonessential religious jewellery is not the same thing as banning an essential article of faith.", "[removed]", "Conversations are dull because they don't want to discuss religion in any context, due to trauma?

A cross necklace or a rosary, hell even a scapulary are not necessities for a practicing catholic, they are symbols of their pride and practice of their faith, but they are in no way comparable to hijab.\n\nIn any case, its a muslim woman\u2019s choice whether to wear hijab, but it is very strongly encouraged by their religion.\n\nSomehow I get the feeling that OP and their gf are not the type to force someone either way. Its also relevant that them and their partner in particular struggled due to christianity and/or catholicism, so maybe clothing and other symbolizers of islam don\u2019t affect them in the same way.", "You are choosing to take this personally, and you are misunderstanding OP - why aren\u2019t you taking into consideration where OP and her GF comes from in having these rules for THEIR home? Why is the first thing you think that they want to oppress your expression of/lived experience of being religious? Why aren\u2019t you instead taking a step back from your immediate reaction of anger to consider that they might want to avoid symbols that can trigger traumatic flashbacks? Also, even if OP and her GF wanted to forbid any religious symbols in THEIR home just because they don\u2019t agree with it, you are still a person with autonomy. You can choose to not be friends or associate with them. No need to feel so personally victimized, instead try to be curious of the other person\u2019s history and perspective.", "No. It's not the same - and I'm saying that as someone who's grown up enmeshed with Christianity.   People wear cross necklaces because they *want* to express their faith and they find it comforting - but absolutely zero denominations count wearing that necklace as an article of faith or as a mandatory religious garment. It is not at all the same level as various religions' requirements for head covering or the Sikh kirpan, or other religious clothing.", "I agree.

Taking it off is too far for me. \n\nIt\u2019s also not comparable to \u201callowing Islamic people in the house covered up,\u201d like many people bring up because that\u2019s not the religion that traumatized them, pure and simple.

This point is also why I laughed at them being called \u201canti-theist.\u201d They\u2019re explicitly okay with shows of religiousness within the house by friends they trust if not involving a trigger, that\u2019s not a complicated concept.
