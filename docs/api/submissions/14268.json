Many religions require accoutrements. Muslim, Sikh, Hindus, various Christian sects all (can) require specific clothing or accessories to be worn.", "NTA for banning religion in your home. I mean, you\u2019re adults and have had enough.

Not wanting religion in your life is absolutely your right, but to go as far as to not allow her to wear jewelry that is important to her personal beliefs and restricting her sharing what is happening in her life seems to be taking it too far. Some of the restrictions are completely reasonable like telling her not to invite you to church anymore or not wanting proselytizing or praying in your home. I think you should reign it back slightly by setting the example of mutual respect by allowing her to wear her own religious jewelry and share parts of her life as long as it doesn\u2019t cross the line of proselytizing.", "If you were truly a no religion space it would apply to your Muslim friends and their hijabs.

I'm a bi woman myself, and my cross necklace is a part of my identity as a believer in a God full of love, not one tied to any specific religion (even if the cross is significant in certain ones like catholicism), if any of my friends ever asked me that, honestly I would be offended because 1. Why would you think my belief on a God is a direct attack towards someone I love? 2. Why do you make my religion a \"you problem\"? Like whether I talk or belief in upstairs daddy or not doesn't have any effect in those who surround me. And 3.

The difference is you\u2019re punishing your mother just because you can.\n\nYou\u2019d be completely right to ask her to not preach to you or mention the bible or teachings or anything like that.

You see other religions as fine -- maybe as quirky cultural artifacts, sometimes even as helpful practices. You'd never be so rude as to tell a Jewish person to keep their Jewishness out of your home. You wouldn't dream of mocking a Muslim person for refusing to eat bacon. You might even be okay with displaying Buddhist prayer flags or \"New Age\" crystals and statues, because to you, those aren't about religion, they're about the aesthetic.\n\nHowever, you respond to any trappings of Christianity like they're a personal attack against you. You don't have a space in your brain for the idea that people might be practicing Christianity in good faith (pun unintended). You see things like cross necklaces and stories about what happened at church as \"gratuitous,\" because deep down, you don't believe that people would ever do those things sincerely. If anything, you treat visible Christianity as a kind of virtue-signaling -- things that people do to show they're better than others, not things they do because you'd actually believe it (as opposed to, say, what your Muslim friends do).\n\nRight now, you're responding to your mom like she's wearing that cross necklace specifically to hurt you, or like she's telling those stories about the church-happening events in her life just to spite you. And she may well be! But also, I think that's just what her life is like. It's just that her life also activates a trauma response in you, and that's not fun.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think you want to make your home a \"no-religion zone\" so much as you want your mom to STFU. Which is a fine thing to want! Honestly, I get it. I just think that instead of making lofty proclamations, it's better if you just tell your mom that what she's doing is hurting you, and that you're not obligated to let someone in your house who hurts you or your partner. As long as you play this up like a blanket \"religion ban\" but let non-Christian religious stuff in your home, she's going to have ammunition to call you a hypocrite. You don't have to care about that accusation, but from the fact you posted here, it seems you do.\n\nI think some of this, too, is going to involve your having to sort through your own responses to her behavior. If she shuts up about the church stuff but keeps wearing the necklace, is that okay with you?

This point is also why I laughed at them being called \u201canti-theist.\u201d They\u2019re explicitly okay with shows of religiousness within the house by friends they trust if not involving a trigger, that\u2019s not a complicated concept.

Not in any situation. \n\nWe've talked in this sub a lot about how the question \"am I being an asshole?\" is not the same as \"do I have the legal right to do this thing?\"\n\nThis is one of those times.", "Then maybe it's the last conversation to have before going NC. I'd definitely ask her to leave if she started talking about her faith when asked not to and let her know she's not welcome. All I'm saying is I get all of the other boundaries, this one just seems a bit extreme.", "According to OP, *all* of her mom\u2019s friends are \u201cchurch friends\u201d.\n\n>That means no praying, no religious symbols of any kind, no proselytizing, **no talking about religious settings**. My mother hates that, because all her friends are churchgoers and 80% of her stories relate to something happening in church.\n\nSo if some kid got drunk off communion wine, that would still be off-limits.  Even though that would be *hilarious*.", "Yep, I bet that every somewhat normal therapist would encourage that boundary, especially with someone who is KNOWN to cross boundaries", "Sure. That\u2019s the situation *the mother* put herself in with her actions. \n\nIf those are all her friends she should talk about what they get up to outside of church. If that\u2019s not possible, she\u2019s the one who can decide to visit or not."]}
