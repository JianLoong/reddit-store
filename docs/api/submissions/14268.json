I refused to do confirmation, which enraged my mother but she backed off after the priest told her that was my right. She \"didn't approve\" of me being bi (which is weird, she surprisingly is ok with gay people) and still dragged me to church hoping I'd grow out of it.\n\nLong story short I moved out at 18, and have kept a respectfully distant relationship with her. She's mellowed a bit in her age, but she still tries to invite me to church every week, even after I told her plainly to cut that out. She's respectful to my girlfriend, mostly because I will choose her over my mother if it comes to that, and it nearly did when she accused my girlfriend of being a predator when we met due to our age gap.\n\nMy girlfriend has an even more traumatic past with religion.

My mother hates that, because all her friends are churchgoers and 80% of her stories relate to something happening in church. She also gets mad that we make her take off or cover her cross necklace, as are the rules. She claims we're being hypocrites, to which I told her she's lucky to be in my life at all.

Your house your rules! But I personally think telling her to cover up her cross necklace is probably one step too far.", "Understandable but I\u2019d be careful about the clothing g/symbols/jewelry ban and who you could potentially alienate in the future as far as friends. Many religions require accoutrements. Muslim, Sikh, Hindus, various Christian sects all (can) require specific clothing or accessories to be worn.", "NTA for banning religion in your home. I mean, you\u2019re adults and have had enough. You might give a pass for jewelry or storytelling of things that happened with church folks, though, as long as they aren\u2019t preachy or evangelistic. But you do you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being hypocritical at all.", "NTA for the rest, like no religious artefacts and no religion talk - your house your rules.\n\nBut YTA for policing what your mother wears even in your own home to such an extent. A single necklace is very subtle and it isn't your role to dictate that jewellery be removed. You can ask politely (which itself would be AH-ish, but at least respectful), but you have no right to demand.", "YTA \n\nSo I am guessing that no Muslims can come into your home wearing a hijab. No Sikhs can come into your house either. Or Jews wearing a kippah. Will you make them shave to enter your home as well? Basically, you are bigots using your issues to force others. \n\nBasically, you are doing to others what was done to you. Congratulations. You are shoving your views down the throat of any guest in your house.", "I understand the background behind it, but slight YTA for taking it too far. Not wanting religion in your life is absolutely your right, but to go as far as to not allow her to wear jewelry that is important to her personal beliefs and restricting her sharing what is happening in her life seems to be taking it too far. Some of the restrictions are completely reasonable like telling her not to invite you to church anymore or not wanting proselytizing or praying in your home. I think you should reign it back slightly by setting the example of mutual respect by allowing her to wear her own religious jewelry and share parts of her life as long as it doesn\u2019t cross the line of proselytizing.", "If you were truly a no religion space it would apply to your Muslim friends and their hijabs. I imagine you would allow them to pray. Not just Christians. The way you apply the rule you are a no Christian space and you are being a hypocrite looking for revenge. If this is about your mom then cut her out or take your issues to therapy.", "You're  taking things a bit too far here and acting very  much  like a militant anti-theist. Ultimately  it  is your decision  but  you  won't  heal any of your  pain by treating  your  mother  like garbage or treating  religious  symbols  like the plague.  It won't kill you if your mother  wears a cross anymore  than it killed me to talk to Satanists who wore a pentagram.", "ESH don\u2019t police harmless jewelry especially if your going to pick and choose what it applies to", "I think asking someone to change their outfit or avoid talking about their friend group is a little far. Would you ask your Muslim friend to remove her headscarf in your home? That's quite disrespectful. Noone should be enforcing their beliefs on you, but I don't think you should be enforcing yours on anyone else, or interfering with their bodily autonomy either. I guess it's your right to set rules as it's your home but you may as well just refuse to have a relationship with anyone who has religious beliefs.", "ESH, but you a little less. Rhe reaso  why you're the asshole is policing your guests' jewerly. I'm a bi woman myself, and my cross necklace is a part of my identity as a believer in a God full of love, not one tied to any specific religion (even if the cross is significant in certain ones like catholicism), if any of my friends ever asked me that, honestly I would be offended because 1. Why would you think my belief on a God is a direct attack towards someone I love? 2. Why do you make my religion a \"you problem\"? Like whether I talk or belief in upstairs daddy or not doesn't have any effect in those who surround me. And 3. I know it's your house, but being asked to leave a big piece of who I am by your doorstep before coming in, sounds more like just what all those biphobics AHs did to you (and to me). \nThat's the only reason you're the asshole too, because you can't just prohibit the use of something that could be so very special for the person you claim to care about. \n\nMy cross was the one always between my palms while both my parents where in the hospital with cancer. It held my hand more than some friends even. So it would hurt so much if you were a friend and knowing why it means so much to me and hiw I don't use it to throw hate but to remind myself of love, you asked me to take it off. \n\nJust like we can't \"take off\" our sexuality, we can't take off our symbols that truly represent a part of us without being disloyal to our values as a decent person.", "YTA.

Your house your rules but YTA for taking it too far and using your trauma as revenge. Not all religious people are bad. There are good and bad people in all walks of life. You don't have to have it in your own but you can't dictate what other people do with their lives and what they wear.

It\u2019s her identity, changing it for you would be very hard, and you know how hard it is to force yourself to change because of someone. In this case it\u2019s your choice wether you\u2019d like to be the bigger person or not.", "NTA. A: it\u2019s your house, therefore it\u2019s your rules and b: it sounds like religious trauma. There\u2019s absolutely no need for you guys to make yourselves go through that in your own home.\nI am so goddamn sorry that happened to you. I hope you two live a happy and fulfilling life.", "NTA. As somebody who was raised Catholic and is also queer, I completely understand making your home a religion-free space. I have done the same. It\u2019s your home and you have to do what you need to make it comfortable. If your mother doesn\u2019t like it, she doesn\u2019t have to come round.", "YTA. I was with you untill you asked her to remove or cover her necklace. That impedes on the freedom of relegion. Feels the same as forcing someome not to wear jeans because you don't agree with it.", "YTA. If you want to be a good host, you need to accommodate for people with different beliefs. I\u2019m Christian and would never even think of asking a Hindu person to not bring their beliefs into my house.", "Nah, your space, your rules.", "NTA it's your house your rules.", "NTA! Your house, your rules. Just like they dragged you to church when you lived under their roof, they should follow yours when they visit!", "[deleted]", "NTA. It\u2019s generous that your mother is even welcome in your house - she doesn\u2019t seem to actually accept who you are and your lifestyle, she simply tolerates it because she wants to stay in your life. \n\nHaving an overall no religion rule sucks though. Of all people you should understand that it sucks to deem which beliefs and lifestyles are acceptable for others. \n\nI would give up the cockamamie rules and be direct with your mother that it\u2019s her religious beliefs that have hurt you. It is those beliefs that are incompatible with who you are, and they are unwelcome in your home.", "NTA. Your home, your rules.

I had a roommate who had PTSD from religious abuse", "NTA - As others have said, your house, your rules.", "NTA your house, your rules....and it is not ironic....when you lived there, their rules were to be followed..but now it is a horrible thing to expect from them.", "NTA. \n\nI believe in religion and follow my own, though not entirely committed to it. \n\nNor do I disrespect any religion or people's choice of pursuing it. I only have a problem with people who talk shit about following culture and tradition and the ones who don't as well.\n\nIt's your house and it's entirely your choice. Plus, you and your partner have had traumatic experiences with religion in the past. And it's entirely your choice to leave religion.\n\nI respect you for that choice and I respect you for speaking up.\n\nYour house, your rules. \n\nYour mother can't do shit.", "Kinda NTA, but taking it a bit too far in my opinion", "NTA To the no religion rule in your house. Your house your rules. YTA to making your mother either cover up her cross or remove it.", "NAH I mean it\u2019s my personal opinion that someone else\u2019s influence starts and stops at their body/what they wear, etc. so I feel you go a bit far in asking her to remove her cross necklace, since that is a genuine expression of herself (rather than say, a pointed Christian t-shirt proclaiming \u201cLove The Sinner\u201d or something). I suppose it doesn\u2019t really matter regardless since your mother is on the backfoot here and you could take or leave her presence in your lives. \n\nyou can choose the rules of your home, and she\u2019s free to simply meet with you outside your home if she doesn\u2019t want to abide by them. \n\nsecondly, you\u2019ve mentioned in another comment that you allow muslim friends to wear their headscarves in your home, and I (think? would hope?) you might feel uncomfortable asking someone to remove a star of david necklace, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s not a dissonance to treat your mother\u2019s necklace differently considering that it\u2019s Christian religious trauma, not broadly (all) religious trauma.", "NTA --- Yet again another example of why religion should be totally banned for children till they are old enough to decide for themselves if they want to be indoctrinated and brainwashed into believing that there is an imaginary man in the sky watching over everything that we do and if we pray to him be good little sheep we will get let into heaven.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
