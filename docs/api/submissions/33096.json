I have a full family, younger sister, and divorced parents. \nI am in very tense relationship with his sister, she never accepted me, even though I tried sweetening the pill with presents and being very understanding, but I gave up after getting no positive response. \nMoreover, we had a massive fight with his sister and her painful words \"I hate you\" still haunt me. \nNowadays, I live with my future husband. \nFor Holidays none of us is spending time with our families, we will be celebrating with friends, so I decided to buy gifts for my sister and mom. As I am in bad relationship with his sister, and my presents have always been in vain, I didn't even consider getting her anything. His mom, on the other hand was positive towards me and we are in okay ish relationship. But she is spending her Holidays in another country and honestly I didn't even think about getting her anything. Today I was buying my mom a spa treatment, and while on the phone with my fiancee his mom overheard our conversation and got upset.

It's not the time to  yet so how does she know we didn't get her anything? 2. Why is that my responsibility, if it's your mother we are talking about?

NTA", "You don\u2019t have a MIL problem, you have a husband problem. NTA and she wouldn\u2019t think you haven\u2019t gotten anything if it wasn\u2019t for your husband. Why is he causing drama between you and his family and why can\u2019t he get his own mother a present.", "Wow, SO is apparently still nursing at mommy\u2019s teat. Sorry but the picture you paint implies this. She overhears your convo and goes to son with juvenile petulance. Then son yells at you on behalf of mommy. Not about who goes where on what holiday. It is about boundaries, it is about respecting each other in a relationship as both adults and as primary other person over mommy and daddy and siblings. There is a reason it is written that in marriage you leave your parents and cleave to each other. \u201cLeave\u201d speaks to more than geographic proximity. It speaks to cutting the apron strings and honoring and respecting your spouse, putting them in first position. Until hubby figures this out, you will continue to have this aggravation and conflict because at this point you are not just in conflict with MIL but also with him. As for the gift, use your creativity. SO has no suggestion because mommy has not told him what she wants and he only knows what she tells him. A gift card or a pretty dish, something innocuous, safe\u2026.and returnable. Good luck with it all.", "NTA if he doesn\u2019t buy your mom presents and you don\u2019t know how FMIL knows you didn\u2019t get her a gift, it\u2019s because mommy\u2019s boy told. Your answer that he should get the gift was perfect. Don\u2019t give in to his immature pouting. Are you sure this is the future family that you want. Choppy waters ahead.", "Yeah, he\u2019s the worst. Kind of lazy! A lazy asshole!!", "NTA, that\u2019s your future husband\u2019s job and responsibility not yours.", "NTA\n\nSay him he is right and should buy his mother a present.", "NTA.  His mother, his responsibility to buy her gift.  My husband and I have been married for 33 years today and it has always been that way with our respective families.", "Oh, jeez, no, NTA.  Your future husband is the real AH in this story.  It's his mother, so it's his responsibility to figure this out.  The gift can be a combined gift from you and your fiance, but ultimately, for him to throw you under the bus like that makes him a massive AH.\n\nHowever, I do want to say that using the excuse that that she's leaving the country is a bit of a poor excuse.  Hold onto the gift until she gets back.", "Info: does your fiance give your family gifts that are from him exclusively? Also are you receiving gifts from mil and sil?", "Ok, I'd say NTA but some caveats. First you can still buy someone a gift even if you won't literally see them on Christmas. I think it is weird to get bent out of shape about as an adult, but if you'd pay a gift for her if she was home, you should probably buy one for her if she's not. Second, regardless of your boyfriend overreacting (which I do think he is) you need to stop asking him what to get for his mom. He's clearly not in the mood to be helpful and every time you ask him it is only going to frustrate the both of you.  \n\n\nThose (very minor!) caveats out of the way, I'm so sorry. It is dumb for an adult to get mad about not getting a present from someone (there are exceptions but this is the case generally speaking). Additionally with it only be December 15th, I'm not sure anyone can say you haven't gotten a present for this woman only that you haven't yet gotten her one. Also, not for nothing, but it is pretty common for married people to give gifts to their parents as a unit so your fiance could/should've thrown your name on his gift to his mom and called it a day.", "NTA \n\nit is your spouses job to remember and procure gifts for his family members gifts, and you should do the same for yours. He can ask for your expertise/assistance but this shouldn\u2019t be on you. \n\nI believe that his Mom knows that if you don\u2019t get her anything then she won\u2019t receive anything from him.", "This is the future you want for yourself?", "ESH\n\nThis is simple: Each of you buys presents for their own family, and since you're engaged, each partner signs them from BOTH of you.\n\n No one is responsible for the other's family that way.", "NTA, you are correct- how did she know you didn\u2019t get her anything? Christmas hasn\u2019t been celebrated yet so how did she know? I would be telling husband either he should start buying your mother gifts at Christmas time or he does his mother and you will do yours.", "You are not the AH. He doesn't buy your mom gifts so why should you buy his mom a gift. And why is she upset? Christmas hasn't even came. She has no idea what you have for her. She sounds very entitled", "NTA  \n\n\nYou are caught in the crass commercialization of buying. Buying things for people who have little or no meaning to you. Why are you doing this? Why is your future husband against you, when he should be for you?  \n\n\nI do not play in this game.", "Just apologise for the misunderstanding and ask your fianc\u00e9 what he has got your mum and how much the present was, so it gives you an idea of what to get and budget. If he hasn't bought your mum a present yet, just ask him to get two when he does, one for your mum, one for his. \n\nNTA.", "ESH. Whether or not you get your MIL a present depends more on whether she buys you anything and not what your SIL or fiancee's expectations are. \n\nBut you and your fiancee are a couple now. You should, together, be discussing your budget for presents, who you will buy for, and who will do the shopping.\n\nIt sounds like traditionally you've bought the presents. Whether that's fair or not is beside the point here; if you want to change things you need to communicate about it.", "Dont feel guilty but learn from this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
