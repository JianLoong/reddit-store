He has been diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome some years ago. He has used that as an excuse to behave in a horrible manner ever since and quite frankly his parents have enabled him.\n\nHe recently managed to push away his only remaining friends and then decided to turn his negative attention on our family.\n\nHighlights include calling the police and making a false report against my uncle and my Nan. Harassing my mum for days on end and laughing at her when she begged him to stop because her hypertension as a result landed her in hospital. Wishing my father dead from a condition he\u2019s struggling with etc.\n\nI blocked him preemptively because I could see where this was heading. So after he realised I was blocked he called my firm and told them that I was leaking privileged information and breaking client confidentiality. Now he had no proof but because of the nature of our work the partner had to investigate even the possibility.\n\nObviously that led to consequences at work for me and while I\u2019ve been cleared it was hard, and I missed the promotion window.\n\nMe and my husband are furious and he drafted a cease and desist notice for me along with a notice that I would sue for defamation of character. I signed it and sent it to my cousin.\n\nNow his parents are saying I\u2019m punishing the mentally unwell and he didn\u2019t know what he was doing nor does he have the money to pay for the suit. Honestly I\u2019m not inclined to listen to them but even my parents think I should have left it alone.

His mental health isn't the issue , it's his enabling parents'.\n\nYour Cousin is purposely harrassing you and your family and that comes with legal consequences, civil or otherwise. Have you considered including the Parents in the suit?", "Here's the thing. If he truly didn't know what was going on he should have a legal guardian who implements a behavior plan for his safety and safety of the people around him. He likely wouldn't meet the threshold for this, though that depends on where you live. \n\nThe suit should move forward. Even as a way to document his behaviors. Sounds like he's escalated to violence in the past. Start your paper trail so if he does anything again there's no way to say he didn't know. You've shown him this is unacceptable by taking legal action.", "NTA.  You should sue him for slander (or libel, I forget which is which) and encourage your entire family to block him.  He is twisted and needs help.", "NTA - he needs a taste of criminal proceedings to stop him doing it again! What next, he accuses someone of SA and they land in prison? He sounds very unhinged", "NTA to use legal remedies to protect yourself and your family from an abusive and bullying cousin who is enabled and protected by his parents.  Consult with your lawyer about the steps to follow. A full blown trial in the Court trial may not be necessary. But if it is, don\u2019t hesitate to do what needs to be done using both the civil and criminal avenues.", "Neurodivergence does not give one license to be an abusive asshat, as your cousin an his parents seem to believe.

Their enablement of his shitty behavior and actions are what will \"tear the family apart\", not your reaction to it. NTA, OP. I hope cousin learns these lessons well.", "Didn't know what he was doing? Sure sounded like he did, that was a very specific thing to accuse someone of to get them in trouble.

I (39f) have co-existing ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and ADHD. Aspergers is no longer a stand alone diagnosis, it's all part of the ASD. I DO NOT act like that and neither do my neuro divergent children. Either his parents have lied about the extent of his diagnosis or he needs reassessed. What ever you're cousins motivations are, they are not linked to mild ASD.\n\nContinue to protect yourself and your family. I would certainly persue the defamation suit as this may follow you in your career regardless of the outcome of the internal investigation. Based on the type of sensitive role you have then reputation is key and you must protect yours. He is clearly a danger to society, given that he's already put your mother in hospital.

Additionally, people with Asperger's generally do not have learning impairments nor destructive conducts towards others. \n\nHis behaviour against friends and family is pathological and should be treated in therapy. If his parents are allowing him to continue doing things like this, he's going to become a huge dick, but it won't be related to his autism. An autism diagnosis is not related at all with becoming an asshole. \n\nNTA, OP, but your cousin certainly is. I would continue forward with the sueing (sorry I know this is not the right word but I can't think of the correct one, English is my third language).

His parents need to understand that he almost cost you your job because he has Asperger's Syndrome which I'm sorry he has, but that does not give him the right to do what he did.

He has been diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome some years ago. He has used that as an excuse to behave in a horrible manner ever since and quite frankly his parents have enabled him.\n\nHe recently managed to push away his only remaining friends and then decided to turn his negative attention on our family.\n\nHighlights include calling the police and making a false report against my uncle and my Nan. Harassing my mum for days on end and laughing at her when she begged him to stop because her hypertension as a result landed her in hospital. Wishing my father dead from a condition he\u2019s struggling with etc.\n\nI blocked him preemptively because I could see where this was heading. So after he realised I was blocked he called my firm and told them that I was leaking privileged information and breaking client confidentiality. Now he had no proof but because of the nature of our work the partner had to investigate even the possibility.\n\nObviously that led to consequences at work for me and while I\u2019ve been cleared it was hard, and I missed the promotion window.\n\nMe and my husband are furious and he drafted a cease and desist notice for me along with a notice that I would sue for defamation of character. I signed it and sent it to my cousin.\n\nNow his parents are saying I\u2019m punishing the mentally unwell and he didn\u2019t know what he was doing nor does he have the money to pay for the suit. Honestly I\u2019m not inclined to listen to them but even my parents think I should have left it alone. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a relative in his 40s who *supposedly* was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as a child, back when it was still a legitimate diagnostic term.\n\nNowadays, Asperger\u2019s is deemed to be a mild version of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we don\u2019t use the term \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d clinically anymore.\n\nAs for my relative, he and his mother used the \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d excuse to justify his horrible behaviour.\n\nHowever, as an adult, he was diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD, the clinical term for sociopathy). He fits this diagnosis *perfectly*.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in a clinical setting with both autistic patients and patients with ASPD. Inexperienced clinicians can easily confuse the two diagnoses for a variety of reasons.\n\nFor example, autistic people often struggle to express empathy, but they still *feel* it. Patients with ASPD experience little to no empathy, depending on the severity. An inexperienced clinician can\u2019t always tell the difference.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying your cousin has ASPD, or that he doesn\u2019t have an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). I can\u2019t issue a drive-by diagnosis.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line:\n\n1. ASDs don\u2019t excuse harmful and/or criminal behaviour. Unless a person is severely autistic and intellectually incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions, ASD isn\u2019t an excuse. Your cousin is 100% aware of his behaviour and acting with intent.\n\n2. Not every person with an \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d diagnosis actually has an ASD, particularly if they were diagnosed during the over-diagnosis era of the 2000s-2020s.

His parents are definitely enabling him but I can\u2019t help but feel that they are victims of him too (to some extent).  He\u2019s in his late 20\u2019s and is an adult and needs accountability.

I\u2019d definitely sue and file a restraining order.", "NTA\nI've seen a few people get diagnosed and turn into GIANT assholes.

I attended a university that is nationally known for its disability access and support for students with disabilities both physical and invisible. As such I interacted with a lot more folks on the ASD spectrum than I had previously or would have anywhere else. Guess what? There are people with ASD who are caring, compassionate, friendly people who fully take responsibility for their actions. There are also people with ASD who are unsympathetic, mean, and just downright terrible people, just like with neurotypical people! ASD can lead to some uncommon and maybe sometimes disconcerting social interactions, but it does NOT mean that a person is necessarily going to terrorize their friends and family. I personally find it wildly offensive (as well as just plain wrong) when people attribute others\u2019 terrible behavior to ASD.

My neurodivergence created an oops, and my neurodivergence isn't my fault, but that doesn't mean I can't try to make it right! \n\nNot my FAULT and not my RESPONSIBILITY are not the same thing!\n\nLet's look at an example: My son knocks over a glass of water because the dog ran up and licked him, startling him while he was sitting at the table. Knocking over the glass is *not his fault* but cleaning up the water *is his responsibility*. I can help him, and I will, but we can't just say \"Well it wasn't anyone's fault or his fault so it doesn't get cleaned up\". And we shouldn't necessarily say \"Oh that's not his fault he doesn't need to clean someone else will\". We also don't have to say \"He did that no matter why he needs to clean it up\". There is empathetic middle ground here but only if we treat everyone with agency, respect, and basic dignity. \n\nHonestly the logic around disability or neurodivergence in this capacity is so flawed and actually quite infantilizing. Do we just go out whole lives letting the world deal with or clean up our messes for us because we aren't at fault for them? Like a freaking baby? I'm responsible for navigating my life and my relationships. I will fuck that up. Guaranteed. But no one else is going to unfuck it for me, nor should they just tolerate it being fucked. The more I practice unfuckening shit, the better I get at it. Seriously these parents need to do better and OP needs to sue the fuck out of that asshat.", "The mentally ill still need to be held accountble! You're not putting his disibility on trial, *he is*, because of his choices and actions. Him and his family use it as a scapegoat, but in the court it just means you go to a facility instead of jail. Either way, people with authority and no bias need to step in before he kills someone (on purpose or through his sadistic actions).", "Even if you are putting it on trial, his parents need to do a better job at helping him maintaining it instead of enabling him to do what he's doing.  And the harsh truth for the cousin is, people are going to protect themselves (and are allowed to when their family/health/well being is affected) at his expense if he's not careful.  You can't just bully people and expect no one to stand up to you.", "This is absolutely deranged behavior. He needs to be under the care of a psychiatrist.", "The above poster makes a great point. I worked heavily with the ASD community for over a decade and none of this cousin\u2019s behavior is indicative of ASD. He might have ASD, but also clearly has other issues (or maybe is just a bad person). The ASD really doesn\u2019t seem to be the issue. \nFurthermore, it\u2019s pretty easy to fake a \u201chigh-functioning autism diagnosis\u201d. Basically, you just look up the signs online and then mention to your doctor \u201cI might have ASD because I exhibit these signs\u2026\u2026..\u201d.    Of course, the doctor will usually do a little more probing, ask questions, refer you to an expert who might run you through some exercises. However, if someone knows what to say, they can pretty easily get a false ASD diagnosis. I\u2019m not a doctor, but this situation raises my suspicions that your cousin could fall into the \u201cfake diagnosis\u201d category.", "I assumed you already knew, but I have spent decades working with government employees, and so I have the habit of stating the obvious for their benefit. :D\n\nBut yeah - Someone needs to pay for this. My condolences, it sounds like a nightmare for your family.", "Yeah do it, regardless of whether you're TA or not (which you aren't), it's your career and future that's important to you.\n\n\nHe fucked around and now he just needs to find out", "Please do it. He needs either a big slap to get him back on a track of behaving in a way others are not in danger. Or he needs real help with his mental health. Hope court helps.", "Not at all. Being on the autism spectrum does not excuse being an asshole. I have a lot of experience with ASD. It is not a licence to behave as you wish, without consequences. His parents have done him a big injustice by enabling him so long, as he has no fear of the consequences of his actions. They will not be around to coddle him forever, and have done little to prepare him for life without them. The way I see it, you would be giving him a valuable life lesson.", "You said he had as Asperger's diagnosis? That's not nothing. \n\nI think it *could* make you the asshole. Depending on what your damages are, you might give the impression that you're picking on a disabled person.", "I disagree with your premise. Asperger\u2019s is a difficulty in perceiving social cues and maintaining relationships. It is not causing malicious harm to your friends and family. Therefore his diagnosis doesn\u2019t even come into the question, beyond his parents claiming he should never face any consequence in life because of it.\n\nBut if that\u2019s your opinion i won\u2019t argue with it.", "NTA - I've got autism though it was called Aspergers for years.\n\nAll my friends have Autism and none of them would do this.\n\nHe seems like a bad guy that's hiding behind his Aspergers to get away with it.\n\nAlso even if he is that bad and not aware of what he's doing, he's not safe out there and the parents should have put a stop to it.", "I just dont think you should underestimate the weight his diagnosis could carry in court. Asperger's is a lot more than what you described and you are admittedly skeptical of the diagnosis. It can be read as ableist (delete this post, btw). You could lose a lot of money, and social relationships, if it doesnt play out like you hope.", "I\u2019m not ableist. \n\nYou keep trying to argue for an insanity defence when I have physical evidence of his intention (mens rea), acknowledgment of what the consequence of his actions would be towards me, and his defamation and slander against me (actus reus).\n\nI have already told you that there is a case to be made here. I\u2019ve already told you I\u2019m not persecuting someone who is mentally incompetent. I\u2019ve already told you that the question is whether it\u2019s worth it to take the social consequences in my family that my cousin may retaliate and/or his parents will make life hard for my Nan (in which case I\u2019m TA) or if I should proceed (NTA)"]}
