He has been diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome some years ago. He has used that as an excuse to behave in a horrible manner ever since and quite frankly his parents have enabled him.\n\nHe recently managed to push away his only remaining friends and then decided to turn his negative attention on our family.\n\nHighlights include calling the police and making a false report against my uncle and my Nan. Harassing my mum for days on end and laughing at her when she begged him to stop because her hypertension as a result landed her in hospital. Wishing my father dead from a condition he\u2019s struggling with etc.\n\nI blocked him preemptively because I could see where this was heading. So after he realised I was blocked he called my firm and told them that I was leaking privileged information and breaking client confidentiality. Now he had no proof but because of the nature of our work the partner had to investigate even the possibility.\n\nObviously that led to consequences at work for me and while I\u2019ve been cleared it was hard, and I missed the promotion window.\n\nMe and my husband are furious and he drafted a cease and desist notice for me along with a notice that I would sue for defamation of character. I signed it and sent it to my cousin.\n\nNow his parents are saying I\u2019m punishing the mentally unwell and he didn\u2019t know what he was doing nor does he have the money to pay for the suit. Honestly I\u2019m not inclined to listen to them but even my parents think I should have left it alone.

His mental health isn't the issue , it's his enabling parents'.\n\nYour Cousin is purposely harrassing you and your family and that comes with legal consequences, civil or otherwise. Have you considered including the Parents in the suit?", "Here's the thing. If he truly didn't know what was going on he should have a legal guardian who implements a behavior plan for his safety and safety of the people around him. He likely wouldn't meet the threshold for this, though that depends on where you live. \n\nThe suit should move forward. Even as a way to document his behaviors. Sounds like he's escalated to violence in the past. Start your paper trail so if he does anything again there's no way to say he didn't know. You've shown him this is unacceptable by taking legal action.", "NTA.  You should sue him for slander (or libel, I forget which is which) and encourage your entire family to block him.  He is twisted and needs help.", "NTA - he needs a taste of criminal proceedings to stop him doing it again! What next, he accuses someone of SA and they land in prison? He sounds very unhinged", "NTA to use legal remedies to protect yourself and your family from an abusive and bullying cousin who is enabled and protected by his parents.  Consult with your lawyer about the steps to follow. A full blown trial in the Court trial may not be necessary. But if it is, don\u2019t hesitate to do what needs to be done using both the civil and criminal avenues.", "Neurodivergence does not give one license to be an abusive asshat, as your cousin an his parents seem to believe.

Their enablement of his shitty behavior and actions are what will \"tear the family apart\", not your reaction to it. NTA, OP. I hope cousin learns these lessons well.", "Didn't know what he was doing? Sure sounded like he did, that was a very specific thing to accuse someone of to get them in trouble.

I (39f) have co-existing ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and ADHD. Aspergers is no longer a stand alone diagnosis, it's all part of the ASD. I DO NOT act like that and neither do my neuro divergent children. Either his parents have lied about the extent of his diagnosis or he needs reassessed. What ever you're cousins motivations are, they are not linked to mild ASD.\n\nContinue to protect yourself and your family. I would certainly persue the defamation suit as this may follow you in your career regardless of the outcome of the internal investigation. Based on the type of sensitive role you have then reputation is key and you must protect yours. He is clearly a danger to society, given that he's already put your mother in hospital.

Additionally, people with Asperger's generally do not have learning impairments nor destructive conducts towards others. \n\nHis behaviour against friends and family is pathological and should be treated in therapy. If his parents are allowing him to continue doing things like this, he's going to become a huge dick, but it won't be related to his autism. An autism diagnosis is not related at all with becoming an asshole. \n\nNTA, OP, but your cousin certainly is. I would continue forward with the sueing (sorry I know this is not the right word but I can't think of the correct one, English is my third language).

His parents need to understand that he almost cost you your job because he has Asperger's Syndrome which I'm sorry he has, but that does not give him the right to do what he did.

He has been diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome some years ago. He has used that as an excuse to behave in a horrible manner ever since and quite frankly his parents have enabled him.\n\nHe recently managed to push away his only remaining friends and then decided to turn his negative attention on our family.\n\nHighlights include calling the police and making a false report against my uncle and my Nan. Harassing my mum for days on end and laughing at her when she begged him to stop because her hypertension as a result landed her in hospital. Wishing my father dead from a condition he\u2019s struggling with etc.\n\nI blocked him preemptively because I could see where this was heading. So after he realised I was blocked he called my firm and told them that I was leaking privileged information and breaking client confidentiality. Now he had no proof but because of the nature of our work the partner had to investigate even the possibility.\n\nObviously that led to consequences at work for me and while I\u2019ve been cleared it was hard, and I missed the promotion window.\n\nMe and my husband are furious and he drafted a cease and desist notice for me along with a notice that I would sue for defamation of character. I signed it and sent it to my cousin.\n\nNow his parents are saying I\u2019m punishing the mentally unwell and he didn\u2019t know what he was doing nor does he have the money to pay for the suit. Honestly I\u2019m not inclined to listen to them but even my parents think I should have left it alone. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a relative in his 40s who *supposedly* was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as a child, back when it was still a legitimate diagnostic term.\n\nNowadays, Asperger\u2019s is deemed to be a mild version of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we don\u2019t use the term \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d clinically anymore.\n\nAs for my relative, he and his mother used the \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d excuse to justify his horrible behaviour.\n\nHowever, as an adult, he was diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD, the clinical term for sociopathy). He fits this diagnosis *perfectly*.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in a clinical setting with both autistic patients and patients with ASPD. Inexperienced clinicians can easily confuse the two diagnoses for a variety of reasons.\n\nFor example, autistic people often struggle to express empathy, but they still *feel* it. Patients with ASPD experience little to no empathy, depending on the severity. An inexperienced clinician can\u2019t always tell the difference.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying your cousin has ASPD, or that he doesn\u2019t have an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). I can\u2019t issue a drive-by diagnosis.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line:\n\n1. ASDs don\u2019t excuse harmful and/or criminal behaviour. Unless a person is severely autistic and intellectually incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions, ASD isn\u2019t an excuse. Your cousin is 100% aware of his behaviour and acting with intent.\n\n2. Not every person with an \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d diagnosis actually has an ASD, particularly if they were diagnosed during the over-diagnosis era of the 2000s-2020s.

His parents are definitely enabling him but I can\u2019t help but feel that they are victims of him too (to some extent).  He\u2019s in his late 20\u2019s and is an adult and needs accountability.

I\u2019d definitely sue and file a restraining order.", "NTA\nI've seen a few people get diagnosed and turn into GIANT assholes.

I attended a university that is nationally known for its disability access and support for students with disabilities both physical and invisible. As such I interacted with a lot more folks on the ASD spectrum than I had previously or would have anywhere else. Guess what? There are people with ASD who are caring, compassionate, friendly people who fully take responsibility for their actions. There are also people with ASD who are unsympathetic, mean, and just downright terrible people, just like with neurotypical people! ASD can lead to some uncommon and maybe sometimes disconcerting social interactions, but it does NOT mean that a person is necessarily going to terrorize their friends and family. I personally find it wildly offensive (as well as just plain wrong) when people attribute others\u2019 terrible behavior to ASD.

My neurodivergence created an oops, and my neurodivergence isn't my fault, but that doesn't mean I can't try to make it right! \n\nNot my FAULT and not my RESPONSIBILITY are not the same thing!\n\nLet's look at an example: My son knocks over a glass of water because the dog ran up and licked him, startling him while he was sitting at the table. Knocking over the glass is *not his fault* but cleaning up the water *is his responsibility*. I can help him, and I will, but we can't just say \"Well it wasn't anyone's fault or his fault so it doesn't get cleaned up\". And we shouldn't necessarily say \"Oh that's not his fault he doesn't need to clean someone else will\". We also don't have to say \"He did that no matter why he needs to clean it up\". There is empathetic middle ground here but only if we treat everyone with agency, respect, and basic dignity. \n\nHonestly the logic around disability or neurodivergence in this capacity is so flawed and actually quite infantilizing. Do we just go out whole lives letting the world deal with or clean up our messes for us because we aren't at fault for them? Like a freaking baby? I'm responsible for navigating my life and my relationships. I will fuck that up. Guaranteed. But no one else is going to unfuck it for me, nor should they just tolerate it being fucked.

Not that I necessarily think you\u2019re wrong for the lawsuit but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to achieve much. It sounds like your cousin needs some kind of reassessment (possibly for a personality disorder) and then needs social services or mental health services to attempt to correct his anti social behaviour. Because it really does sound like if this just continues on unchecked that he\u2019s going to cause some very real harm and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s outside of the realms of possibility to end up with police involved if he\u2019s already been known to show violence against his family. Someone needs to step in and \u2018parent\u2019 him where his parents haven\u2019t whether that\u2019s day services, residential or with a carer trained to manage his outbursts.\n\nIn the U.K. I think I would be inclined to suggest submitting a safeguarding concern to social services/safeguarding adults board. Both about him but also about the people he\u2019s living with who now feel his outbursts are affecting their health.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter if this is related to his autism or not, or whether you are sure of that or not. It looks like he\u2019s in need of help for *something* that he\u2019s clearly not getting because this is not normal behaviour. It might just be that he\u2019s a raging asshole enabled by his parents but in that case he needs to stop being enabled by his parents at the very least.", "I worked with autistic kids and kids with intellectual disabilities, sometimes they overlap, sometimes they don\u2019t. But, I know this and tell people that having any kind of autism and or ID diagnosis does not mean that person isn\u2019t an asshole. There\u2019s sometimes behaviors, tantrums etc from kids who would be on the Asperger\u2019s end of the spectrum, but a little experience with an individual kid will tell you if it\u2019s because of \u201cnormal childhood\u201d misbehavior or if they\u2019re needing some help learning to regulate or react differently to some emotions, figure out sensory issues and other stuff. They\u2019re people like anyone else and have to learn consequences are a thing. Parents are sometimes the ones we help train more than the kids.", "Exactly! We're still learning about our diagnosis as it's relatively new. I was always told I suffered depression but it seems that was a symptom of my undiagnosed neuro divergence. Despite all of it, I got educated, have a career and have always been a law abiding citizen. Just because we think differently, miss social cues or get overwhelmed in crowds or whatever doesn\u2019t stop us understanding right from wrong.", "Seriously. Having any kind of autism and being an asshole are not mutually exclusive. Especially in teens (from my experience). Part of being a teen is sometimes learning how to not be an asshole. That\u2019s no different for people on the spectrum. Sometimes overly blunt communication or figuring out nuances can make one seem like a jerk, I\u2019ve struggled with that my whole life (per my psychiatrist, adhd thing not autism) but that\u2019s not what this kid has been doing.", "Having BPD must be tough. I understand you not wanting to be labeled as a stereotype but I truly hope it's not at the price of you being happy and your authentic self.\n\nI completely agree with you, as an adult his behavior can't be excused!", "One of my children is mildly autistic. Autism does not cause antisocial behaviors of the kind described here. Autism does not cause people to intentionally defame others at work, nor to commit the types of intentionally violent acts OP describes. This guy has a personality disorder. Unfortunately, you can't fix those, you can only give consequences sufficient to force them to modify their overt behaviors, and teach the families to cope with it.", "That behavior is defo not because of mild symptoms. Parenting may have contributed but he's an grown adult now. No excuses.", "he is a spoiled brat who needs to be checked. His parents are not doing him any favors by continuing to let him manipulate people.", "OP, given this incident, his general maliciousness, and the bottle incident with his parents at 17, please be mindful of a potential escalation of violence, both against you, and vulnerable/elderly family members. (Have their been other incidents?)\n\nIt may seem alarmist, but if he attacks with broken glass over *a burger*, what might he do if sued?  (Which I absolutely think you should, btw. NTA.) This person is incredibly dangerous.", "OP said in another comment he has a full-time job (clarification given to show that he has the funds to pay for fees, as OP said in the same comment he doesn't pay rent), although he could probably use some hobbies that don't include terrorizing the people around him to occupy his time when he isn't at work.", "nta and if there is a possibility of getting your career back on track, sue yesterday", "NTA. The misguided need to look at the cause of the family falling apart. It is not your lawsuit.  That is an effect.   The cause is the ahole cousin and his parents who justify everything.   \n\nProceed as planned, at least you have factual evidence (lawsuit winning) of this not being true for your employer and future employers.  \n\nYour nan can be sad BUT it is your cousins fault not yours.", "They clearly aren\u2019t responsible enough to take care of him. It sounds like he is a danger to himself and others, as well as a liability to himself and anyone who would otherwise be responsibility for him.\n\nOP, you NEED to sue. He also needs adult protective services or someone to investigate.", "This. \n\nMy family had several folks with autism, and not ONE of them would have done this. The worst any of them has done that I can remember was when my cousin stole some geese from a park. \n\nI kept geese at the time and he saw children throwing stuff at the geese, so he chased the geese down and put them in his car and drove them to me. \n\nWhich admittedly wasn\u2019t strictly legal, but he was also 16 and tended to lose his senses in the face of animal abuse so I\u2019m counting it as a win that he didn\u2019t throw any children into the pond. (This is a JOKE, he never would have done such a thing. He\u2019s impulsive but not violent and he knows not to attack people, especially kids.)", "Same in my house. Half of us have adhd, the other half are autistic. My autistic husband is nothing like the cousin in the OP. He\u2019s well educated (PhD in biophysics) and had a successful career in drug development before retiring a few years ago. He raised two lovely daughters with his late wife and helped finish raising mine (mine were teens when we married).  He owns our house outright, participates in activities he enjoys, and supports me in the activities I enjoy. \n\nAutism isn\u2019t \u201cmentally unwell\u201d. It\u2019s another way the brain processes the world. Can it be difficult? Sure. The world isn\u2019t readily accepting of people who\u2019s brains operate a bit differently. In my own home sometimes my adhd needs and his needs clash. But we are adults and we work things out. Those parents ruined that kid.  It\u2019s not his autism that causes his poor behavior. It\u2019s the poor parenting he received.", ">Now his parents are saying I\u2019m punishing the mentally unwell\n\nnot neurodivergent myself, but i gotta say that this disturbed me deeply. neurodivergent people arent \"mentally unwell\" (or they can be as much as anyone else, in addition to it, but neurodivergent =/= mentally unwell).", "Exactly, it's not that relevant if it's because he's neurodivergent or not. It needs to be dealt with, not used as an excuse. He can learn to be better.", "I really appreciate your comments and insight. Thank you.", "This, some people will harass and bait people on the spectrum. Which doing to someone regardless of being in the spectrum or not can trigger someones anger. It seems nobody has done this, unless in his mind he is acting out of revenge for some reason...? Either way his revenge or reactions are out of proportion. Which will get him in jail at some point.\n\nAs someone who is neurodivergent (not Austin though) I have had people harass me and bait my anger. I had taken steps to remove myself from the situation. I would make reports about things that happen. Which thing would happen so abuses people would try to lie and gaslight light about what happened and delete any evidence I had. \n\nThis would trigger my anger as a person as it is a form of emotional abuse and reactional abuse. IE taking some things for day on end I had set in spot so I don't forget them.Then dropping them in my car a few days later trying to say I lost it. Which is false and not true.\n\nit like people expect neurodivergent people to just happily except abuse,lying,and gaslighting. I'm not saying what he did is okay, but there is definitely something deeper than just autism.", "He has a personality disorder that has nothing to do with autism if he's doing these things. The only thing that sometimes stops these people is consequences that they cannot escape. In the case of this guy, prison may be the consequence eventually as he's violent as well as a person who commits defamation.", "Also, that does not sound like autism at all. Like maybe he is autistic also, but there's something else going on here.\n\nI know some autistic people who have had violent outbursts that I would not consider responsible for their actions. This cousin sounds totally different. Sue his pants off.", "This is not a meltdown. It is a deliberate and calculated act.", "This isn't a meltdown.  It is calculated cruel behaviour.", "Meltdowns are uncontrollable reactions to an immediate situation. This is planned, strategic fuckery.", "For the most part, I'm not unhappy.   Just have to keep my reactions and emotions from hurting myself and those around me.\n\nDoing pretty good at it.\n\nBut, thank you for the kind words.", "Exactly! You have to have patience and be willing to explain or assist people who are neurodivergent, you don\u2019t give them a free pass to do whatever they want and to harm who ever they want.", "Thanks for the clarification. I wonder how he behaves at work?", "No you\u2019re right, it never hurts to remind people! Thank you for your concern x", "Yeah his parents are not doing their jobs and are not equipped to deal with their adult toddler by the sounds of it. APS needs to step in and at least provide some (hopefully mandatory) resources for the family to use to get better control of their situation. This is the type of situation where if he keeps being left unchecked he could seriously hurt or kill someone during an episode.", "He should be the property of the state before he kills someone, that is if they\u2019re in the US I don\u2019t know if they do that anywhere else, since his parents are unable to handle him.", "Grand theft geese?", "Violent behavior is a possible symptom of autism, but it is not an excuse. It needs to be dealt with instead of ignored.", "That is such a sweet story. I'm assuming you felt you had to give them back? Though if you didn't, I certainly wouldn't blame you!", "If he literally cannot learn to be better, if his autism (or other factors) effect him to the extent that he is violent, dangerous, and endangering other people's health, wellbeing, and financial security, then he needs constant supervision. \n\nBut that's obviously not the case. He could control himself he just doesn't because he has never had to face consequences.", ">unless in his mind he is acting out of revenge for some reason\n\nExactly, the 'offense' that OP made against him was preemptively blocking his number when he started harassing other family members, so he lashed out by moving that harassment to her work. \n\nIf he knew enough to report \"leaking privileged information and breaking client confidentiality\" to her workplace, then he knew exactly what the consequences could be for OP. He knew what he was doing and did it anyway.", "Oh, I agree. But if he's going to use meltdowns as justification, then that comes with its own set of concerns and consequences.", "In this particular situation, yes. I very much doubt his justifications.\n\nBut violent meltdowns aren't myth. And if he's using this as justification, that means he's unsafe.", "I'm curious about that as well, whether he harasses his coworkers like he harasses his family or if he behaves properly. I don't imagine he'd be able to keep a job long if he behaved at work like he does around his family, but maybe he uses his diagnosis as a shield in that context as well?", "Yep. \n\nAlthough the game warden in my area (he was my neighbor and we had a lot of interactions due to my poultry\u2026) did say that technically it might not be a crime since the park in question hadn\u2019t \u201cprovided\u201d the geese, the geese were in fact feral. \n\nBut I don\u2019t even begin to know what he meant by that so I\u2019m not gonna get into that. \n\nThere\u2019s a story about why the game warden and I were friendly, but it involves turkeys, not geese.", "Well yeah, but I feel like by teenhood most of the non neurotypical relatives had gotten a handle on their violent behavior. Hence why I said my cousin was impulsive but not violent, he had a list of \u201cright things to do\u201d (not like on paper, although he probably could write them all down if asked to) and getting violent with kids was definitely not on his mental list of acceptable behavior. \n\nKidnapping geese to take them to a safe place where no one would throw things at them on the other hand evidently was morally acceptable. (And yes, I kept the geese. The park should\u2019ve protected them from feral kids if they wanted to keep them and I wasn\u2019t gonna drive them from Waco back to grapevine.)", "Violence is a result of or symptoms of many things. IE targeting for  bullying, harassment, autism, or abuse. Maybe something showed that people don't know about and in his sick way he is getting revenge.", "I did not give them back, no. Talked to a neighbor who was a game warden and he told me the park technically didn\u2019t own the geese as they were feral not domestic or wild.", "When I have an autistic meltdown, I cry and stomp around and go take a nap. I do not stab people or call offices with malicious false information.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how high the barriers for incompetent to stand trial or an \u201cinsanity\u201d plea are.", "What, OP is just supposed to let their life get ruined by the cousin because holding them accountable could be seen as abelist?\n\nI'm all about respecting people's problems with mental health, but they too have to share the planet with the rest of us, and if you're intentionally trying to fuck up someone's life, then expect yours to get a little fucked up, too.\n\nNot trying to be cruel but these are serious things that this cousin is doing and his parents don't seem to care. It seems like it's about time to welcome the three of them to the world of consequences.", "Is it not ableist to assume an adult capable of acting out maliciously is incapable of handling the consequences because of their neurodivergence?", "It's an answer that generates more questions... Now, I would know more about the turkey's story...", "Sure, but that's not everyone. I am autistic as well and I still struggle with violence.\nThe geese story is funny though. I admit I've wanted to do similar things before.", "When I was younger, my meltdowns were based on \"flight\" in the fight or flight response. If that meant biting the person holding me?\n\nI was not including the call in my description of \"meltdown.\"", "And I told you my opinion. \n\nYou also never clarified your actual damages.", "This is a civil case, Matlock. OP has to prove intent.", "I agree, they are serious. Remeber though, we also only have her perspective, and she is understandably emotional about her family. This isnt what the court will hear, that will be very different. \n\nThis case would also likely be thrown out. She didnt lose her job, she has no real damages to speak of.", "lol, it was pretty funny yeah. \n\nAnd I know that struggle too. Im not autistic, but I had anger problems most of my life (probably still do, but I feel like I\u2019m more in control now) and occasionally had to deal with violent urges. \n\nI very rarely acted on them (and I\u2019d say every time I have after the age of 11 or so has been justified) but the urges are sometimes really upsetting.", "It\u2019s\u2026in the post..?", "I think you misunderstand what \"intent\" means for purposes of a defamation suit (at least for US law -- I can't speak to non-US standards). Defamation is an intentional tort, but it doesn't require proof of intent to cause harm. It requires proof of intent to make a statement with defamatory meaning with knowledge that the statement is either untrue or knowledge that you don't have a factual basis to support the statement. (If OP were a public figure, actual malice is an added element, but we have no indication the OP falls within that category).\n\nThe statements as described are defamatory per se, which makes it even easier to prove a case. The information provided in the post indicates it causes actual harm to OP's reputation (out of pocket losses not required, but maybe probable due to loss of promotion).", "Why would it be thrown out? They called in a false claim, that can damage reputation. Damage of reputation does play a role in defamation of character.\n\nWhat other perspective do you want? No matter what, there is no real or justified reason to file a false claim like that, unless it was a true claim. I don't understand why you're pulling so hard for this asshole.", "Your *monetary* damages. These are your *actual* damages, your loss of reputation and embarrassment are your *punitive* damages.", "We dont know what statements were made or how. We dont know the stated reasoning behind them. We dont know the cousin's ability for executive function or cognitive thinking. \"Knowledge based on fact\" is the key imo. OP also had no monetary damages, and didnt lose her job so \"loss of reputation\" doesnt really factor either.", "The only real remedy the courts can give are monetary awards. To do that, the plaintiff has to prove damages. OP has a giant hurdle in that she (as far as I can tell) doesnt really have any.", "Monetary damages are actual damages. Her monetary damages are the loss of promotion and consequent financial gain. Loss of reputation and embarrassment  can also be actual damages.\n\nSource: my law degree and bar license", "I have Asperger\u2019s. The OP is not being abilist. And my neurodivergence should not allow me or anyone else with this to behave the way the cousin has. I appreciate your concern but it is misguided.", "We do know the content of the statements, it is described in the post.  Unless you are simply assuming OP is lying, we also know there was no \"proof\" offered or available, and that the cousin is high functioning and holds a job. Nothing in the post supports an assumption by you or anyone else that the cousin was incapable of understanding what he was doing. (Are you the cousin or aunt or uncle?)\n\nMonetary damages are NOT required for defamation per se, and harm to reputation, even temporary during the period of investigation, is enough to prove no monetary damages. Actual monetary losses are not required under US law for defamation per se, though as I noted OP might be able to prove such losses due to missing a promotion. \n\nOP has a valid and viable claim, and as a US lawyer who has litigated more than one defamation suit (both for plaintiff and defendants), I would have no hesitation signing a pleading asserting that claim under US law. It might not be a slam dunk winner. Actually litigating it to conclusion might be more trouble and hassle than it's worth. (Frankly, most litigation is.) But based on the information provided, it is a viable claim, and perhaps worth pursuing at least to the point of making the cousin experience some consequences for being an asshole.", "OP can correct me if I'm wrong but this seems more like the true objective is to get him to stop trying to ruin her life, not just to get money. You're focusing on a very specific part of this, and not the bigger picture.\n\nAgain, it seems like you're trying to paint OP as some abelist asshole who is trying to \"pick on a disabled person\" just to get a payday, all while giving the biggest benefit of the doubt possible to someone who is clearly acting with intentional malice.", "That\u2019s\u2026 not true at all. You really shouldn\u2019t be acting like an authority on subjects when you clearly know very little."]}
