You clearly know that. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it would be with a baby! My daughter was older when we got our first puppy.\n\nYour husband is being completely unfair. Like you said, he\u2019s not going to be there, it\u2019s going to be you who has to do all the hard work.\n\nI think you need to be very clear about this. Now is not the right time for you.

You're 100% right here, including his lack of respect.  Have him stay home for two weeks and do your entire role if possible - go somewhere without him, don't be at home.

What he did is completely unfair. He can continue to take your children to play with dogs, but not to encourage them with promises to get their own. He's not the one at home to care for and train the animal; his vote shouldn't even count here.\n\nAnd honestly, when your children are old enough and you have some breathing room to consider getting a dog, there is no reason to go for a puppy. A young adult or adult dog that's already housebroken and has some training and social skills would be a lot less work.

What I would do right now is doggy visits, showing your children how to be properly introduced to a dog, how to be gentle when they are allowed to pet a dog when they are not allowed to pet a dog what is a service animal and why they should be left alone. Understanding what your husband did is separate from how your kids need to learn how to interact with pets animals strangers animals dogs that may wander into your yard etc. As stressful and upsetting as he approached this stepping back. Letting him know oh that's a great idea to try to introduce the kids to animals but we are not bringing one home. Let him know that this is a situation that you and him can talk about and need to talk about before anything is brought into the house. I would also highly recommend taking the time to introduce your kids to animals because this is also a safer way to find out if anyone has any allergies. you know you're not ready for this you know your household is not ready for this you know that this is an overwhelming thing and that he is stepping over your boundaries.

You were clear about that. \n\nI would honestly suggest either returning the puppy immediately, with an explanation that you did not consent to adopting it, or making it clear that you personally will not be caring for it at all. He brought it home, he manipulated the situation by getting the kids involved, it's his problem.", "Wow, I hope you get marital counseling. I hope you guys will be able to work through this. NTA.", "NTA!! I have 2 yr old son and we have 8 yr old dog we've had dog since she was 1 and let me tell you it's so hard taking care of dog and my son and my dog is super easy and well behaved! I cannot imagine having 3 young kids you have and a puppy. That's way too much especially since your are SAHM and husband never home. I feel kids are too young help with dog. Maybe if had kids bit older over age 8 that could help feed and walk dog it would be easier but kids are way too young to really help especially since you mentioned puppy and you have a baby at home. Hell to no. You are right on this. Husband is delusional especially since he probably won't help", "My girl is 18 months and good am I counting down until she hits the 2-year mark so that she calms down a bit!", "I skip all that and adopt senior dogs.", "We\u2019re going to need an update. NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. That was so unfair of him to do that to you.", "Dont let him leave for work without the dog. If you do anything for the dog he has won and knows he can get away with treating you like crap.", "Do you have anywhere else to go? If you do, leave for a few days to just take care of you and baby. It sounds like you need some time to refocus and think about what you want.", "Absolutely. Good on you.", "Call them again for sure", "The specific way that OP's husband went about adopting the puppy is set up in such a way that if OP did that, she's the scapegoat.", "Me too. What a disappointment.", "This. The 3 y/o will throw the biggest of melt downs if OP sends the dog back. This is so manipulative. UGH.", "I assume that was his plan.", "The 3 year old will forget it. Driving it back is the best choice."]}
