Your husband needs to take a few weeks off from work. You leave him home alone for 8 hours a day Mon-Fri for those three weeks. He's responsible for all three kids, cooking, and cleaning..... See if he still wants a dog after that.", "NTA - three kids under 5 and he wants a puppy? That would be a NO from me too. Hubby needs a reality check on what is possible for one person to do in a day.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a dog person, I\u2019ve raised 3 from puppies to old age. However. Omg they\u2019re hard work. You clearly know that. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it would be with a baby! My daughter was older when we got our first puppy.\n\nYour husband is being completely unfair. Like you said, he\u2019s not going to be there, it\u2019s going to be you who has to do all the hard work.\n\nI think you need to be very clear about this. Now is not the right time for you. He needs to listen. If he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ve got a bigger problem than you may have realised.", "NTA. A puppy is a serious responsibility not just a cute one off.", "NTA\n\nTaking your child to the shelter to get attached to an animal is incredibly underhanded and manipulative and I would make it very clear to him that it's a huge betrayal of your relationship.\n\nThree kids is a LOT and he should absolutely not be pressuring you to bring ANY more living beings into the house than you can manage if he won't be able to take on the responsibility himself.\n\nIf he keeps going behind your back like this and pushing you to adopt an animal you can't care for, you may have some really hard thinking to do. I'd be livid too.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRefuse to take care of HIS puppy. Tell him HE has to take her to the office or rehome her. And all walks will have to be done by him. DON'T WVEN start for ONE day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: OF COURSE \"Our relationship will never be the same after this.\" ... YOu have found out he is a manipulative AH and you can not trust him. He certainly does not treat you like a partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu should discuss this in couple's therapy.", "NTA but your husband definitely is for not respecting your feelings on the matter and for using your child to manipulate you into getting the dog.", "NTA. Getting any kind of pet is a 2 yes situation. If one person says no, then it's a no.\n\nYour husband is trying to manipulate you by taking your child to the shelter as you will look like the bad guy saying no.\n\nTell him that when he stays home and does everything that you do then he can get the dog that he wants!", "Ooohh hell no. Put your foot down this instance. This is is so disrespectful. You have so much on your plate, you don't need a puppy right now. If you get a pet then both need to be ok with it.\n\nNta", "NTA. Your husband is an asshole. You're already doing far too much. These guys who think housework and childcare magically happen, or aren't work at all, make me so mad. A puppy is a LOT of work.", "NTA.  You're 100% right here, including his lack of respect.  Have him stay home for two weeks and do your entire role if possible - go somewhere without him, don't be at home.  Then he can see what's reasonable.  (I know the baby might not make that possible right now, so adjust the concept as needed.)", "So NTA! I found the first 6 months of having a puppy so much harder than adjusting to parenting. It's exhausting and frustrating and sure there's also lots of joy but I was at my wits end much of the time. And I did it at a time when I thought I was ready!\n\nYour plate is full both physically and emotionally, it is not the right time. Talk to your husband again. He doesn't just get to be the fun dad who brings home the puppy and dumps all the responsibility of dog ownership at your feet.", "NTA, and I feel sorry for the puppy too. Sorry that he was adopted by someone who refuses to think of them as a living being with needs that need to be met, and instead taken home like a cute ornament that\u2019s convenient for him whenever he wants to divert his attention to something \u201ccute\u201d.  This is not an ideal situation for either you or the puppy, at all.", "NTA. He sure is though.", "Also, consider calling the shelter to ask their advice", "NTA - I have just seen your edit & I'm livid on your behalf. I love dogs, I have 3. One likes to sneak onto the bed at night & snuggle BUT what your husband has just done is awful & shows a total & utter lack of respect for you.\n\nBeing a SAHM is all kinds of exhausting. If you are not in a space to take on another living thing on top of doing EVERYTHING else then you damn well should not have to!\n\nTo use your children like this to get what he wants is unbelievable & puts you in an impossible position. Either you go along with this & hope you can keep it together (which you might!) or you demand tbf dog goes back & you are tbf evil parent.\n\nJfc. What a tosser!", "I would never get a puppy again. So much work, so much pee, so much poo, so much chewing and soooooo much work.\n\nIf you do get a rescue, look for a 1~3 yo \"teenage\" dog. Still a puppy and full of energy, but they have outgrown the chewing stage. Also likely they are potty trained since the shelters work on that in the shelter.\n\nTell your husband if he gets a young puppy, he will have to do ALL the cleanup and all the walks or you will re-home it. You have enough cleaning to do with two kiddos, you don't need a puppy on top of all that.\n\nNTA.", "Take it back tomorrow.", "Nta, having a dog is a big responsibility.", "NTA - this falls on you to handle and your husband shouldn't be making unilateral decisions that effect your day to day.", "NTA. What he did is completely unfair. He can continue to take your children to play with dogs, but not to encourage them with promises to get their own. He's not the one at home to care for and train the animal; his vote shouldn't even count here.\n\nAnd honestly, when your children are old enough and you have some breathing room to consider getting a dog, there is no reason to go for a puppy. A young adult or adult dog that's already housebroken and has some training and social skills would be a lot less work. You'd also know what kind of personality and energy level you'd be dealing with (it doesn't really show up as well in puppies).\n\nedit typo", "NTA. This is a decision you really need to take together. A puppy is wonderful, but also a lot of work and potentially expensive.", "NTA It makes sense to wait until your life isn't quite so hectic.", "NTA. I love dogs and I rescue dogs but it would be like having another kid. It\u2019s not the time for a puppy. The kids are too small to enjoy a puppy with those sharp puppy teeth. It sounds great in his head I guess but he is not thinking of the everyday care of a puppy and training and puppy chews up everything. Oh no hell no.", "NTA..my partner and I love dogs, but we won\u2019t get one until we figure out who will take it for walks 4-5 a day (we live in a condo). We both have agreed to do it once a day, neither has volunteered to step up to do the rest. Thus, no dog yet. If he brings home a puppy I will be thrilled!! It means he just volunteered to do all those walks.", "NTA\n\nAfter that edit, go on effing strike.", "NTA please tell me you're leaving him? Please please please???", "I am so sorry, I only have one kid (15mo) and an older dog. We couldn't add another dog even if we wanted because of how much time it takes. NTA and good luck with the divorce.", "NTA.\n\nSimple rule is that you don't bring a pet into a household without both partners agreeing.\n\nThat he got the dog against your wishes is a massive asshole move.", "NTA. Do you have anywhere you can stay?", "NTA. I would absolutely not have the energy for that. Plus, they get up to go out a lot and cry at night in the beginning and you already have a baby doing that. Uugghh. I'm sorry.", "NTA, obviously.  From the looks of it, your manipulative AH of a husband is going to pay for ignoring that strong backbone of yours.  I'm relieved you realize you can't let him get away with this.", "NTA. Your husband could have done what many people do and volunteer at a shelter to get his fix (I did this in college since I couldn\u2019t find anywhere that would allow dogs).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have every right to be livid. What I would do right now is doggy visits, showing your children how to be properly introduced to a dog, how to be gentle when they are allowed to pet a dog when they are not allowed to pet a dog what is a service animal and why they should be left alone. Understanding what your husband did is separate from how your kids need to learn how to interact with pets animals strangers animals dogs that may wander into your yard etc. As stressful and upsetting as he approached this stepping back. Letting him know oh that's a great idea to try to introduce the kids to animals but we are not bringing one home. Let him know that this is a situation that you and him can talk about and need to talk about before anything is brought into the house. I would also highly recommend taking the time to introduce your kids to animals because this is also a safer way to find out if anyone has any allergies. you know you're not ready for this you know your household is not ready for this you know that this is an overwhelming thing and that he is stepping over your boundaries. Verbally or text put your foot down but with little ears listening make sure that you are aware of how your words will carry to them. As an animal lover surprising a household with an animal is one of the worst things to do for the people and the animals involved.", "NTA but he is.

From now on you are not a stay at home mom that you were. Take care of your babies and that\u2019s it. No more laundry, cooking or cleaning.

This is truly disgusting behaviour on his part op don\u2019t let him get away with him .", "Nta but your husband is being an awful and selfish partner.  And using the kids to manipulate the situation is terrible.  Have him take a week off of work, and you go somewhere else each day to match his hours.

This isn\u2019t a toy for your children. This puppy needs to be cared for just like a child and it seems your husband doesn\u2019t have the time.

That is not a decision for just one partner to make.", "Nta but call the shelter and report your husband. They need to know they sent the dog into a negative situation.

He has just doubled the work load (that he plans off loading on you) in your household by adopting this puppy. A puppy is not a toy to be put away in a closet until it is played with again, it is a lot of work to take care of a puppy.
