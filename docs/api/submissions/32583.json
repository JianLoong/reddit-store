Or made this a permanent switch.   You overreacted bc you felt like she got a \u201cdemotion\u201d, but this is about her and her emotions must be taken into consideration.   \n\nYou could have told her what a great role model she was and how it was awesome she got to show her skills to the 2 year olds.   Instead, you just got defensive.", "I have a feeling you were in no way polite. If you had been it would have been a conversation not an accusation. You need to let go of the idea that your child is perfect, and that you are the expert on everything. You sound like you will be a nightmare for your child\u2019s future teachers. YTA", "NAH. The manager, who was covering the class as a sub, saw a nervous child in a potentially dangerous environment and made the safe choice to put your daughter in a less dangerous environment. It wasn\u2019t meant as singling her out or anything negative, she was genuinely looking at the best interest for your kid (and far away from rowdy 5 year olds definitely sounds like a safer environment). At the same time, I don\u2019t think it was rude of you to inquire and mention your concerns about the instructor situation. She\u2019s the manager, that\u2019s part of the job: addressing customer concerns. You weren\u2019t aggressive about it. I think her silence isn\u2019t a \u201cwhatever dude\u201d thing. I have the distinct impression that she was already going through something and what you said wasn\u2019t necessarily the cause of her crying. Idk about everyone else, but when I have to mask while dealing with a personal matter internally, anything that would typically just make me nervous (like wondering if I made the right choice putting my nervous student in a safer situation with younger students) would start breaking my mask.\n\nI think you just experienced an unfortunate circumstance.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re in a group class. If your daughter was nervous & not in the right environment, she absolutely should have been moved to a lower level class, to best accommodate the overall needs of a group.\n\nIf shes out of sync, she\u2019s out of sync. \nIt is to her detriment to keep her in there when there are more confident / boisterous kids in there, the majority sets the tone.\n\nIf there wasn\u2019t another group that was available, she took the best option possible given the situation. Nervous children in water is never a good idea, and again, it\u2019s a group setting - not personalised individual swim training where her needs solely are taken into account & the program is adapted to her. \nIt won\u2019t be tailored.\n\nIf you\u2019re upset at having different instructors and your daughter is sensitive to that, as well as her learning environment being disrupted when there are more confident & spirited kids around, then group classes probably aren\u2019t the right fit for her. \n\nLook at getting individual lessons with a set instructor / coach. Then it\u2019ll alsways be set to her requirements.\nUntil then, if she\u2019s sensitive to the environment and if / when the group structure changes, either with an alternate instructor or kids she isn\u2019t comfortable with, they will and (should) move her if she\u2019s clearly nervous and uncomfortable in the situation to one that she is. \n\nYou\u2019ve looked at this with pride, and like she\u2019s somehow failed. This is looking through your lens and not hers.\n\nCould have easily been explained that \u201cyou looked a bit worried with the 2 boys jumping around, and an unfamiliar instructor again, and to keep you feeling safe, miss manager moved you out till you could feel ok again\u201d.", "YTA.

If she is nervous, then it is going to make a negative experience, which could make things worse for her in the future. There\u2019s also a safety issue if there were two rowdy boys in the class, then it may have been safer for everyone to remove her to a different class for just that day. When it comes to swim lessons, you should always defer to what the instructor or manager says because safety should be the number one priority.", "YTA, if your daughter was uncomfortable and there were a couple of rowdy boys there and somehow your daughter gets hurt or put in an uncomfortable situation then you will probably blame the manager.. it\u2019s a no win situation for the manager..", "YTA.  When you said she was 4, I was like dear God did they start chastising a child or something... but no, they simply mov d your child to an appropriate class based on their abilities and familiarity with the water.\n\nIn my area there is a class exactly for that, the sole purpose to get them comfortable.  Which you admit your child wasn't.", "Yes, YTA. I was a lifeguard and swim instructor in college and dealing with parents is never easy but we do what we have to do for the children to succeed. You may not like what happened but it\u2019s a huge safety liability to have your child in a class she\u2019s too nervous to be in. I understand her confusion and yours but you should defer to the professionals on this. We go through extensive training, I had to go through multiple Red Cross courses as well as getting my coaching license, we all have to. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt.", ">Obviously my daughter was confused and is quite a bit more advanced than that.\n\nIs she or are you one of \"those\" parents?  I'm thinking the latter.  YTA.", "I can easily imagine OP\u2019s post if the manager had not caught the daughter\u2019s heightened nervousness.  \u201cMy four year old was obviously nervous, but the manager ignored her and made her stay in the situation that was causing her duress.  I just hope it doesn\u2019t make her afraid of the water.\u201d", "YTA Awh Geeze chose your battles. Getting your knickers in a twist over a toddlers swim lesson? Life is going to be hard on you if you don\u2019t chill.", "Yta. It's not that serious.", "I don\u2019t think I can offer a vote here, but I used to teach swim lessons- I would recommend switching to a different swim program if possible. Switching a child in the middle of a class and having different teachers constantly is stressful and confusing, and doesn\u2019t seem like it gives much ability to build skills. Kids need routine, and switching levels, such as moving her to another group, shouldn\u2019t just be done with no discussion in the middle of a class. \n\nBut I do have to ask, how nervous was she actually? As a teacher I would not force a kid to fo something as that can be traumatic and cause fear of water. But if she was refusing to do anything in the class I can see the teacher moving her as an attempt to give her some involvement rather than have her sit out the whole class.", "As a swim teacher myself, in this situation the manager should and could have assisted your daughter 1 on 1 in many ways that would have allowed her to continue participating in her own level. For example, swimming or walking alongside her in the activities, giving her floats etc. Everyone has a bad day sometimes and we are taught as swimming teachers to be inclusive. She could also have split the boys up or asked them to leave the lesson if they were being unsafe after being told to stop.\n\nIf your daughter has joined a new swim school, sometimes the levels are slightly different between centres and she may have needed to move down a level but if this was the case she should have been enabled to continue the current lesson with floats or assistance if necessary and this discussed afterwards.\n\nWith this said, as someone who works with families, the hardest part of the job is dealing with parents' expectations, who often dont understand childhood development from an educational perspective. Often parents can be very confrontational in an effort to advocate for their child, understandably as they are passionate about their child. You may have been paraphrasing the conversation with the swim manager, however if you aren't your language sounds quite confrontational. Sticking to facts and neutral language such as ' why was my daughter moved to that class' rather than the very negative 'singled-out' would have been less confrontational and may have helped you gain clarity on the managers reasoning. She may have had to deal with 10 confrontational parents before you, and she is only human. As long as your child is safe in the pool, that is the most important thing and, in your situation, I might have sent the centre a request for a some sort of compensation for the lesson cost rather than being worried about the slight of being 'singled out'. \n\nAlso, you remaining calm and keeping a positive open mind in situations such as these will be good to model to your daughter and help her develop resilience when she is treated slightly unfairly, as is bound to happen in life.", "Little kids are very much aware of who's a baby and who's a big girl, and being put in with 2 year olds could be quite humiliating for a 4 year old and perceived as failure.  The manager could have stop floating around and worked with the nervous little girl individually.  Problem solved.  \n\nInstead, she set up a situation that took attention away from the 2 year olds, who are taught and communicated with in a very different way than 4 year olds, as well as creating a situation that might well have given the nervous 4 year old a negative message about herself and her swimming ability.\n\nAre we sure that the manager and the instructors are professionals?  Professional educators deal with all kinds of parents, including angry ones, irrational ones, passive aggressive ones, ad infinitum, and it's hard to imagine that the conversation described her would have left a school manager sobbing.\n\nNTA", "YTA, if the boys were the problem she found a solution to make your child more comfortable.", "YTA.\n\nYou were definitely rude, you\u2019re just not saying it. That\u2019s obvious.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s on the instructor (whoever it is) to make those calls. With the two rowdy boys, I would have moved her too. Get off your high horse and let people you agree to teach your daughter, actually teach her. Or teach her to swim yourself and don\u2019t bother these people.\n\nYou aren\u2019t the expert, and you don\u2019t get a say in how lessons are conducted if you aren\u2019t facilitating them.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t \u201csingled out\u201d, she was moved as she was evaluated to have a pretty rough time with the boys there and her nerves. Let the damn workers do their job and just be quiet, ffs.", "YTA", "NTA. I think it was inappropriate for her to change your daughters class midway through. If she had any queries about her readiness it should've been discussed with you, after the class. If she was crying from a minor 'dispute', she isn't cut out to be a manager.", "Manager seems, and apologies for the pun, out of their depth.\n\nThey unilaterally made a decision about your kid's abilities without considering other factors and caused your kid to be upset.\n\nYou said you were calm with how you interracted with the manager.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Definitely NTA. There are so many other options that would have been a better solution than what she did. She could have asked you and your wife if this was your daughter's normal behavior and if you thought she would be more comfortable in the other class for that leason. Or she could have asked your daughter if she is ok, and based on her answer come up with a solution. And what seems like the best option (and what I would have done if I were her), would have been to tell the boys that they would be removed from the class if they didn't calm down and pay attention to the lesson. I wonder if there is much more going on than what you know, like maybe the parents of the boys have reprimanded her for trying to discipline them before, so she thought moving them into that class wouldn't be a big deal but it blew up in her face. \n\nRegardless, what she did and how she treated you when you just wanted to know why she did it, is unacceptable. But if this is the first time something like this has happened, I would just keep note of it for now. As long as another issue with her doesn't come up, I would chop it up to her having a bad day. This time of year is especially rough for a lot of people, so she may have just not been in the right head space to properly handle the situation. But if something like this happens again, you should see about having your daughter in a class that she doesn't oversee and reach out to her higher ups to let them know what is going on.", "YTA. You owe the manager an apology. She did what was best for your child based on her experience. Temporarily moving her because of her nervousness was the appropriate thing to do. This was not a setback in her potential Olympic swimming career. Lessons at this age should be fun.", "YTA. The manager made a decision that she is paid to make. Sorting out the reasons for your daughter\u2019s nervousness likely would\u2019ve taken too much time & attention away from a group class especially since the substitute instructor doesn\u2019t know your daughter or her abilities. If you have overall concerns about the program, you should probably find another place for her to learn.  At the very least, you should have scheduled time to discuss your concerns with the manager rather than taking her attention away from the pool.", "YTA, if you ever approached me about how I was coaching your kid and you proceeded to come at me hot about something you don\u2019t know about (other wise you\u2019d do it yourself) I\u2019d ban you from practices until you were able to be patient. We are teaching skills you could not if you want one on one lessons pay for it. But to blame an instructor for taking your daughter\u2019s nervousness and making a decision based on health and safety. Thank god she\u2019s not wrestling I\u2019d call you a mat dad", "With some details missing, I\u2019m gonna say YTAH", "YTA. Let her do her job. Why were you even there? Does it really both parents to supervise rhe lesson?", "NTA. But I think you should apologize next time you see them because honestly, it sounds like they doing their job correctly. \n\nAbove all else, their job is to ensure kids are safe and don\u2019t drown. Secondary to that is ensuring kids have a positive experience. They saw a nervous (possibly distressed) kid in the water and intervened. They singled your daughter out because she was nervous in the water. It doesn\u2019t matter what the reason was, it was the right move.", "YTA I was a swim instructor for over 20 years as well as a manager of a swim school.  I\u2019ve done pretty much every job possible at a swim school.  The most likely scenario that happened was this.  The manager probably knows your child and their normal behavior, we are trained to recognize changes in a students demeanor.  Now you have a sub in there that doesn\u2019t know your child as well as the manager and normal instructor and two new children who you said you even thought were rowdy.  I can guarantee that they were worse than you observed.  As instructors, we have a very small amount of time to have one on one time with individual students and when we have to pay more attention to safety risk (which rowdy students are) the other kids tend to lose time.  And as someone paying for lessons, you would be pissed if your child was being ignored.  So the manager stepped in and took your child out of a situation where they first and foremost were not safe. Second, was not getting the instruction YOU paid for.  And third, overwhelming to the sub.  At the school I worked out, we had a floating teacher that would step in and help teach the class so you had two instructors instead of one but every school is different.  The manager placed your child in a calmer class with possibly a more experienced instructor.  Most year round schools have a set curriculum for every level and the best teachers know that curriculum by heart.  So your child was getting taught the same curriculum they would have been in their original class just in a calmer environment. A swim lesson isn\u2019t a free for all.  One child swims while the others wait for their turn.  When your child\u2019s turn came around, she\u2019s wasn\u2019t doing what the two year olds do, she was still swimming at her level.  The manager wasn\u2019t singling your kid out, she was trying to maintain order in a very chaotic environment while also allowing your child to receive the instruction that you paid for. And you seem mad about your normal instructor being sick a lot but that\u2019s just how the world is.  As swim instructors, we are very close to your children physically and children are little germ factories. It\u2019s almost impossible not to get sick when your job requires you to literally be spit on by children.  Would you rather your instructor come in sick and get everyone else sick? Or come in sick and out of it so that they can\u2019t be vigilant in the water? Shit can happen so quick in the pool and we want our instructors to be fully aware for the safety of our students.  What the manager did was the right decision, as I\u2019ve told my instructors many times, THEY are the experts here not the parent.", "NTA. Your daughter being more nervous than usual warrants the instructor talking to her and helping her to calm down and go at her own pace despite yet another new instructor plus two new kids in the class who were on the rowdy side. It does not warrant a manager, who is not the instructor of the class, swooping in and switching the kid to a class she's too advanced for. Especially as it doesn't sound like the manager talked to either the instructor or your daughter first. \n\nIt sounds like you were perfectly polite and reasonable in the interaction, especially given the class switch had upset your daughter. \n\nSwitching your daughter from a class of 4/5 year olds at the same level as her to a class of 2 year olds at a level below hers could be very detrimental to your daughter's willingness to attend swim classes in the future. She hasn't just been singled out, and yes the other kids would have noticed her being switched to the 'babies' class, she's also been told by an authority figure that she's not good enough to be with kids her own age. I'd bet your daughter was even more nervous around the younger kids than the ones she was originally with. She'd be worried about showing off or hurting the little kids. And on top of that she'd be bored going over things she already knew and was comfortable with. She'll get nothing out of swim classes below her level and she'll start refusing to go if she stays in the younger class. \n\nMy advice is to talk to your daughter about why she was nervous in her normal class so you can reassure her about whatever worries she had, and then make sure she's in her normal class, for the full session, and not switched back to the younger class. Also talk to her about the switch, explain that the manager was wrong to switch her, but she was worried about how nervous she was and overreacted, and that it doesn't mean she's not good enough for her normal class. It might also be worth looking around to see if there are any other swim classes in the area with more consistent instructors, as those constantly changing won't be helping things.", "Nta if you were Calm, if she crying for a minor thing like that, she should not be a manager", "I'm gonna go with NAH.\n\nI get how you feel, but it was just a temporary switch. The instructor read the situation and did what they thought was best in the moment.

You have no way of knowing if you caused her to cry. For all any of us know some other parent went and made comments to the manager to make her cry. \n\nNow in the swimming classes defense kids instructors are switched pretty regularly as they are all taught to how to handle each level and are placed where a spot needs filling.  It\u2019s the sick season so better an instructor call out for a few lessons then get others sick. If the manager doesn\u2019t regularly watch the classes there was no way of knowing your kids level of comfort and was doing what they thought was safest. She should have explained it like that. \n\nI get the frustration as you pay for the class, but if it\u2019s not her normal instructor you should have rolled with it and talked with them when they were back handling the class as they\u2019d know what to do for next time.", "Nta", "nta", "NTA.

Also we dont know what the actual cause of the manager crying was", "Seems the instructor was under a lot of pressure. I suppose you could\u2019ve helped her by maybe asking the boys to settle down maybe?

If you were polite, that's all that matters. Your feedback as a parent is important, and part of the manager's job is to explain their decisions when asked.

She told me the manager was crying. I felt bad if that's the reason\n\nI'm going with YTA because of this. The conversation that you described, politely pointing out something you weren't happy about with your daughter's swim lesson and asking for an explanation, would not make someone cry.

It makes sense that he didn\u2019t understand some of the things you mention. I think it\u2019s fine that he went to talk to the manager.

Kids aren\u2019t completely incompetent at communicating. My swim instructor communicated with us clearly when I was young. I think that helped most in building my confidence in the water as knowing I could go at my own pace without worry of repercussions was nice. Frankly OP has a point that not having consistent instructors is an issue, and as a manager she should be looking at all possible reasons a kiddo may be nervous, especially if they have been there for sometime. Jumping to conclusions can be just as detrimental as one bad experience.", "Im going to disagree with you. I had a similar experience as the OP\u2019s daughter, where they thought I was \u201cnervous\u201d and moved me to a younger group and it obliterated my confidence.

So then the whole class that OP paid for for that day was a complete waste.\n\nSo the manager not only didn't do her job and calm down the group of kids she was working with, she actively made the situation for one of those kids even worse, wasted OP's money for the class by just wasting everyone's time, and actively made swim class a negative experience for OP's kid.\n\nAnd you're calling OP the asshole because you've simply decided that the scenario happened entirely differently, including deciding OP was far nastier and more aggressive.\n\n> You could have told her what a great role model she was and how it was awesome she got to show her skills to the 2 year olds.\n\nExcept she wasn't being a great role model, she was being lazy and negligent with one of her students.
