She then proceeded to take her to a younger class with 2 year Olds. Obviously my daughter was confused and is quite a bit more advanced than that. She was pretty upset about it. \n\nI do agree my daughter was being a bit more nervous than usual, but in her defense her regular instructor was sick again. They never really have the same instructor. And on top of that there were 2 new boys looked to about 5 years old in her class and were being quite rowdy. Normally it was just her and another little girl.\n\nAfter the lesson was over my wife took our daughter to change and I got the attention of the manager that took her to the other class. And I politely asked to talk, I wasn't rude in any way I felt and just told her I didn't appreciate singling her out like that in the middle of class. She said she doesn't look ready to be in older class and is nervous. I mentioned the 2 new older boys and new instructors all the time. Was basically the end of the conversation. I wasn't happy about it.\n\nI left the pool and met wife in the lobby. She told me the manager was crying. I felt bad if that's the reason, but again I don't think I was rude about it in any way, just told her how it wasn't fair to my daughter \n\nSo WITA?\n\nEdit- I think it's very funny that lots of people are making assumptions (not surprised because it's reddit). I definitely wasn't rude, as a paying parent, I am allowed to talk to them and ask questions about my child's progress. I am also allowed to voice my opinion. \n\nAlso for the people asking how my daughter felt afterwards. Not only was she confused she had to sit on a pad in the water with a life jacket that was too small, kids half her size and watching the other kids she was with play on the slide.

Or made this a permanent switch.   You overreacted bc you felt like she got a \u201cdemotion\u201d, but this is about her and her emotions must be taken into consideration.   \n\nYou could have told her what a great role model she was and how it was awesome she got to show her skills to the 2 year olds.   Instead, you just got defensive.", "I have a feeling you were in no way polite. If you had been it would have been a conversation not an accusation. You need to let go of the idea that your child is perfect, and that you are the expert on everything. You sound like you will be a nightmare for your child\u2019s future teachers. YTA", "NAH. The manager, who was covering the class as a sub, saw a nervous child in a potentially dangerous environment and made the safe choice to put your daughter in a less dangerous environment. It wasn\u2019t meant as singling her out or anything negative, she was genuinely looking at the best interest for your kid (and far away from rowdy 5 year olds definitely sounds like a safer environment). At the same time, I don\u2019t think it was rude of you to inquire and mention your concerns about the instructor situation. She\u2019s the manager, that\u2019s part of the job: addressing customer concerns. You weren\u2019t aggressive about it. I think her silence isn\u2019t a \u201cwhatever dude\u201d thing. I have the distinct impression that she was already going through something and what you said wasn\u2019t necessarily the cause of her crying. Idk about everyone else, but when I have to mask while dealing with a personal matter internally, anything that would typically just make me nervous (like wondering if I made the right choice putting my nervous student in a safer situation with younger students) would start breaking my mask.\n\nI think you just experienced an unfortunate circumstance.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re in a group class. If your daughter was nervous & not in the right environment, she absolutely should have been moved to a lower level class, to best accommodate the overall needs of a group.\n\nIf shes out of sync, she\u2019s out of sync. \nIt is to her detriment to keep her in there when there are more confident / boisterous kids in there, the majority sets the tone.\n\nIf there wasn\u2019t another group that was available, she took the best option possible given the situation. Nervous children in water is never a good idea, and again, it\u2019s a group setting - not personalised individual swim training where her needs solely are taken into account & the program is adapted to her. \nIt won\u2019t be tailored.\n\nIf you\u2019re upset at having different instructors and your daughter is sensitive to that, as well as her learning environment being disrupted when there are more confident & spirited kids around, then group classes probably aren\u2019t the right fit for her. \n\nLook at getting individual lessons with a set instructor / coach. Then it\u2019ll alsways be set to her requirements.\nUntil then, if she\u2019s sensitive to the environment and if / when the group structure changes, either with an alternate instructor or kids she isn\u2019t comfortable with, they will and (should) move her if she\u2019s clearly nervous and uncomfortable in the situation to one that she is. \n\nYou\u2019ve looked at this with pride, and like she\u2019s somehow failed. This is looking through your lens and not hers.\n\nCould have easily been explained that \u201cyou looked a bit worried with the 2 boys jumping around, and an unfamiliar instructor again, and to keep you feeling safe, miss manager moved you out till you could feel ok again\u201d.", "YTA.

If she is nervous, then it is going to make a negative experience, which could make things worse for her in the future. There\u2019s also a safety issue if there were two rowdy boys in the class, then it may have been safer for everyone to remove her to a different class for just that day. When it comes to swim lessons, you should always defer to what the instructor or manager says because safety should be the number one priority.", "YTA, if your daughter was uncomfortable and there were a couple of rowdy boys there and somehow your daughter gets hurt or put in an uncomfortable situation then you will probably blame the manager.. it\u2019s a no win situation for the manager..", "YTA.  When you said she was 4, I was like dear God did they start chastising a child or something... but no, they simply mov d your child to an appropriate class based on their abilities and familiarity with the water.\n\nIn my area there is a class exactly for that, the sole purpose to get them comfortable.  Which you admit your child wasn't.", "Yes, YTA. I was a lifeguard and swim instructor in college and dealing with parents is never easy but we do what we have to do for the children to succeed. You may not like what happened but it\u2019s a huge safety liability to have your child in a class she\u2019s too nervous to be in. I understand her confusion and yours but you should defer to the professionals on this. We go through extensive training, I had to go through multiple Red Cross courses as well as getting my coaching license, we all have to. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt.", ">Obviously my daughter was confused and is quite a bit more advanced than that.\n\nIs she or are you one of \"those\" parents?  I'm thinking the latter.  YTA.", "I can easily imagine OP\u2019s post if the manager had not caught the daughter\u2019s heightened nervousness.  \u201cMy four year old was obviously nervous, but the manager ignored her and made her stay in the situation that was causing her duress.  I just hope it doesn\u2019t make her afraid of the water.\u201d", "YTA Awh Geeze chose your battles. Getting your knickers in a twist over a toddlers swim lesson? Life is going to be hard on you if you don\u2019t chill.", "Yta. It's not that serious.", "I don\u2019t think I can offer a vote here, but I used to teach swim lessons- I would recommend switching to a different swim program if possible. Switching a child in the middle of a class and having different teachers constantly is stressful and confusing, and doesn\u2019t seem like it gives much ability to build skills. Kids need routine, and switching levels, such as moving her to another group, shouldn\u2019t just be done with no discussion in the middle of a class. \n\nBut I do have to ask, how nervous was she actually? As a teacher I would not force a kid to fo something as that can be traumatic and cause fear of water. But if she was refusing to do anything in the class I can see the teacher moving her as an attempt to give her some involvement rather than have her sit out the whole class.", "As a swim teacher myself, in this situation the manager should and could have assisted your daughter 1 on 1 in many ways that would have allowed her to continue participating in her own level. For example, swimming or walking alongside her in the activities, giving her floats etc. Everyone has a bad day sometimes and we are taught as swimming teachers to be inclusive. She could also have split the boys up or asked them to leave the lesson if they were being unsafe after being told to stop.\n\nIf your daughter has joined a new swim school, sometimes the levels are slightly different between centres and she may have needed to move down a level but if this was the case she should have been enabled to continue the current lesson with floats or assistance if necessary and this discussed afterwards.\n\nWith this said, as someone who works with families, the hardest part of the job is dealing with parents' expectations, who often dont understand childhood development from an educational perspective. Often parents can be very confrontational in an effort to advocate for their child, understandably as they are passionate about their child. You may have been paraphrasing the conversation with the swim manager, however if you aren't your language sounds quite confrontational. Sticking to facts and neutral language such as ' why was my daughter moved to that class' rather than the very negative 'singled-out' would have been less confrontational and may have helped you gain clarity on the managers reasoning. She may have had to deal with 10 confrontational parents before you, and she is only human. As long as your child is safe in the pool, that is the most important thing and, in your situation, I might have sent the centre a request for a some sort of compensation for the lesson cost rather than being worried about the slight of being 'singled out'. \n\nAlso, you remaining calm and keeping a positive open mind in situations such as these will be good to model to your daughter and help her develop resilience when she is treated slightly unfairly, as is bound to happen in life.", "Little kids are very much aware of who's a baby and who's a big girl, and being put in with 2 year olds could be quite humiliating for a 4 year old and perceived as failure.  The manager could have stop floating around and worked with the nervous little girl individually.  Problem solved.  \n\nInstead, she set up a situation that took attention away from the 2 year olds, who are taught and communicated with in a very different way than 4 year olds, as well as creating a situation that might well have given the nervous 4 year old a negative message about herself and her swimming ability.\n\nAre we sure that the manager and the instructors are professionals?  Professional educators deal with all kinds of parents, including angry ones, irrational ones, passive aggressive ones, ad infinitum, and it's hard to imagine that the conversation described her would have left a school manager sobbing.\n\nNTA", "YTA, if the boys were the problem she found a solution to make your child more comfortable.", "YTA.\n\nYou were definitely rude, you\u2019re just not saying it. That\u2019s obvious.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s on the instructor (whoever it is) to make those calls. With the two rowdy boys, I would have moved her too. Get off your high horse and let people you agree to teach your daughter, actually teach her. Or teach her to swim yourself and don\u2019t bother these people.\n\nYou aren\u2019t the expert, and you don\u2019t get a say in how lessons are conducted if you aren\u2019t facilitating them.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t \u201csingled out\u201d, she was moved as she was evaluated to have a pretty rough time with the boys there and her nerves. Let the damn workers do their job and just be quiet, ffs.", "YTA", "NTA. I think it was inappropriate for her to change your daughters class midway through. If she had any queries about her readiness it should've been discussed with you, after the class. If she was crying from a minor 'dispute', she isn't cut out to be a manager.", "Manager seems, and apologies for the pun, out of their depth.\n\nThey unilaterally made a decision about your kid's abilities without considering other factors and caused your kid to be upset.\n\nYou said you were calm with how you interracted with the manager.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Definitely NTA. There are so many other options that would have been a better solution than what she did. She could have asked you and your wife if this was your daughter's normal behavior and if you thought she would be more comfortable in the other class for that leason. Or she could have asked your daughter if she is ok, and based on her answer come up with a solution. And what seems like the best option (and what I would have done if I were her), would have been to tell the boys that they would be removed from the class if they didn't calm down and pay attention to the lesson. I wonder if there is much more going on than what you know, like maybe the parents of the boys have reprimanded her for trying to discipline them before, so she thought moving them into that class wouldn't be a big deal but it blew up in her face. \n\nRegardless, what she did and how she treated you when you just wanted to know why she did it, is unacceptable. But if this is the first time something like this has happened, I would just keep note of it for now. As long as another issue with her doesn't come up, I would chop it up to her having a bad day. This time of year is especially rough for a lot of people, so she may have just not been in the right head space to properly handle the situation. But if something like this happens again, you should see about having your daughter in a class that she doesn't oversee and reach out to her higher ups to let them know what is going on.", "YTA. You owe the manager an apology. She did what was best for your child based on her experience. Temporarily moving her because of her nervousness was the appropriate thing to do. This was not a setback in her potential Olympic swimming career. Lessons at this age should be fun.", "YTA. The manager made a decision that she is paid to make. Sorting out the reasons for your daughter\u2019s nervousness likely would\u2019ve taken too much time & attention away from a group class especially since the substitute instructor doesn\u2019t know your daughter or her abilities. If you have overall concerns about the program, you should probably find another place for her to learn.  At the very least, you should have scheduled time to discuss your concerns with the manager rather than taking her attention away from the pool.", "YTA, if you ever approached me about how I was coaching your kid and you proceeded to come at me hot about something you don\u2019t know about (other wise you\u2019d do it yourself) I\u2019d ban you from practices until you were able to be patient. We are teaching skills you could not if you want one on one lessons pay for it. But to blame an instructor for taking your daughter\u2019s nervousness and making a decision based on health and safety. Thank god she\u2019s not wrestling I\u2019d call you a mat dad", "With some details missing, I\u2019m gonna say YTAH", "YTA. Let her do her job. Why were you even there? Does it really both parents to supervise rhe lesson?", "NTA. But I think you should apologize next time you see them because honestly, it sounds like they doing their job correctly. \n\nAbove all else, their job is to ensure kids are safe and don\u2019t drown. Secondary to that is ensuring kids have a positive experience. They saw a nervous (possibly distressed) kid in the water and intervened. They singled your daughter out because she was nervous in the water. It doesn\u2019t matter what the reason was, it was the right move.", "YTA I was a swim instructor for over 20 years as well as a manager of a swim school.  I\u2019ve done pretty much every job possible at a swim school.  The most likely scenario that happened was this.  The manager probably knows your child and their normal behavior, we are trained to recognize changes in a students demeanor.  Now you have a sub in there that doesn\u2019t know your child as well as the manager and normal instructor and two new children who you said you even thought were rowdy.  I can guarantee that they were worse than you observed.  As instructors, we have a very small amount of time to have one on one time with individual students and when we have to pay more attention to safety risk (which rowdy students are) the other kids tend to lose time.  And as someone paying for lessons, you would be pissed if your child was being ignored.  So the manager stepped in and took your child out of a situation where they first and foremost were not safe. Second, was not getting the instruction YOU paid for.  And third, overwhelming to the sub.  At the school I worked out, we had a floating teacher that would step in and help teach the class so you had two instructors instead of one but every school is different.  The manager placed your child in a calmer class with possibly a more experienced instructor.  Most year round schools have a set curriculum for every level and the best teachers know that curriculum by heart.  So your child was getting taught the same curriculum they would have been in their original class just in a calmer environment. A swim lesson isn\u2019t a free for all.  One child swims while the others wait for their turn.  When your child\u2019s turn came around, she\u2019s wasn\u2019t doing what the two year olds do, she was still swimming at her level.  The manager wasn\u2019t singling your kid out, she was trying to maintain order in a very chaotic environment while also allowing your child to receive the instruction that you paid for. And you seem mad about your normal instructor being sick a lot but that\u2019s just how the world is.  As swim instructors, we are very close to your children physically and children are little germ factories. It\u2019s almost impossible not to get sick when your job requires you to literally be spit on by children.  Would you rather your instructor come in sick and get everyone else sick? Or come in sick and out of it so that they can\u2019t be vigilant in the water? Shit can happen so quick in the pool and we want our instructors to be fully aware for the safety of our students.  What the manager did was the right decision, as I\u2019ve told my instructors many times, THEY are the experts here not the parent.", "NTA. Your daughter being more nervous than usual warrants the instructor talking to her and helping her to calm down and go at her own pace despite yet another new instructor plus two new kids in the class who were on the rowdy side. It does not warrant a manager, who is not the instructor of the class, swooping in and switching the kid to a class she's too advanced for. Especially as it doesn't sound like the manager talked to either the instructor or your daughter first. \n\nIt sounds like you were perfectly polite and reasonable in the interaction, especially given the class switch had upset your daughter. \n\nSwitching your daughter from a class of 4/5 year olds at the same level as her to a class of 2 year olds at a level below hers could be very detrimental to your daughter's willingness to attend swim classes in the future. She hasn't just been singled out, and yes the other kids would have noticed her being switched to the 'babies' class, she's also been told by an authority figure that she's not good enough to be with kids her own age. I'd bet your daughter was even more nervous around the younger kids than the ones she was originally with. She'd be worried about showing off or hurting the little kids. And on top of that she'd be bored going over things she already knew and was comfortable with. She'll get nothing out of swim classes below her level and she'll start refusing to go if she stays in the younger class. \n\nMy advice is to talk to your daughter about why she was nervous in her normal class so you can reassure her about whatever worries she had, and then make sure she's in her normal class, for the full session, and not switched back to the younger class. Also talk to her about the switch, explain that the manager was wrong to switch her, but she was worried about how nervous she was and overreacted, and that it doesn't mean she's not good enough for her normal class. It might also be worth looking around to see if there are any other swim classes in the area with more consistent instructors, as those constantly changing won't be helping things.", "Nta if you were Calm, if she crying for a minor thing like that, she should not be a manager", "I'm gonna go with NAH.\n\nI get how you feel, but it was just a temporary switch.

For all any of us know some other parent went and made comments to the manager to make her cry. \n\nNow in the swimming classes defense kids instructors are switched pretty regularly as they are all taught to how to handle each level and are placed where a spot needs filling.  It\u2019s the sick season so better an instructor call out for a few lessons then get others sick. If the manager doesn\u2019t regularly watch the classes there was no way of knowing your kids level of comfort and was doing what they thought was safest. She should have explained it like that. \n\nI get the frustration as you pay for the class, but if it\u2019s not her normal instructor you should have rolled with it and talked with them when they were back handling the class as they\u2019d know what to do for next time.", "Nta", "nta", "NTA.

I suppose you could\u2019ve helped her by maybe asking the boys to settle down maybe?

The conversation that you described, politely pointing out something you weren't happy about with your daughter's swim lesson and asking for an explanation, would not make someone cry.

Kids aren\u2019t completely incompetent at communicating. My swim instructor communicated with us clearly when I was young. I think that helped most in building my confidence in the water as knowing I could go at my own pace without worry of repercussions was nice. Frankly OP has a point that not having consistent instructors is an issue, and as a manager she should be looking at all possible reasons a kiddo may be nervous, especially if they have been there for sometime. Jumping to conclusions can be just as detrimental as one bad experience.", "Im going to disagree with you.

(Like others I\u2019m doubting your tone/approach, leaving the conversation with, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d leads me to believe you weren\u2019t as nice as you said, obviously you weren\u2019t happy or you wouldn\u2019t have complained). \n\nThat being said who knows why the manager was crying, they could have received bad news, been going through a hard time at home, etc. If you KNOW you were 100% polite and proper not sure how you can question whether you\u2019re in the wrong for addressing concerns about your daughter\u2019s swimming lessons to the correct outlet.", "YTA\n\nThis is pretty common most places that do swim lessons.  If you aren't at the ability of the class you are in they will bump you back a level right then and there.  My son had this happen to him.  He didn't see it as \"singling out\" and neither did I.  And in the lower level class he was able to build confidence and had a blast.", "NTA for making her cry. That description doesn\u2019t sound like a cry worthy discussion.\n\nBut, also, let people do their work how they do their work. Right, they teach children all the time. They don\u2019t need you micromanaging swim lesson for a 4 year old.", "NTA for bringing up your thoughts/feelings and hopefully wanting to understand the instructor/manager's understanding of the situation. This is their job though, and you should let them do it - and it seems silly to me that you got so worked up about a toddler's swimming class and which group a kid is in. Even sillier that you wrote about it here. The kid is getting practice being in the water, it's a good thing, are there other ways you could be directing your energy that would be more helpful/productive? RE the crying manager, you could always ask the crying had anything to do with what you said, and if so just be kind/thoughtful. It might be about something else entirely.", "YTA. It's pretty clear you're intentionally being vague about the conversation with the manager to try and minimize your guilt in all of this. \n\nBut here's the thing: \n\nThere was absolutely no reason for her to cry unless you said or did something that warranted that response. You were either cornering the manager, chewing her out, being hostile, being accusatory or being demeaning. It could've been a culmination of all of these things.\n\nBut when you try to tell us that she just suddenly cried after a normal conversation with her, it really seems like you're intentionally leaving out information to not seem like the bad guy", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA, I remember the times I felt cheated as a kid. Surely the manager didn\u2019t mean to make the kid feel bad, but I also feel like it would be the instructor\u2019s choice to move the kid if they didn\u2019t think the level was appropriate, not the manager. Also, I imagine the manager doesn\u2019t come to every class that the daughter goes to, so to see her nervous one day and not observe her a different day as well is pretty weird to me. Like in general principals don\u2019t fail students teachers do, and this situation is similar to me.", "NTA if everything you said is true. I don't know why the manager is crying but maybe she had a bad day. I would also speak on behalf of my child if she was brought down a class. The instructor should have definitely been more tolerant of your child's anxiety and tried to calm her down.", "A manager has to be thick skinned, able to receive such comments without becoming upset.\nMay I suggest? Listen to your daughter. This is all about her. \nASK her, How did it go tonight?  Let her talk without interrupting her.\nAsk,  Did you have a good time tonight?\n\nAgain ask, We saw some boys got loud playing around, so the instructor took you to be with smaller kids.  Was that OK with you?\n\n Again, Ask,  Do you like this swim class? ..\n\nTry to sense if she feels safe and enjoys the class.\n\nIMO the class should have the same instructor every session for the child to get to know, and for the instructor to get to know.  The turnover you mentioned is a red flag to me. \nAnother red flag is the rowdy boys which seems to have bothered your daughter. The instructor lost control of the class to them at your daughter's expense. Big red flag to me.\n\nAll in all, I would be looking for another class.\n\nGood luck to your daughter. Hoping she can have fun, and improve her swim skills.", "NTA - The manager is probably a younger person that is not used to confrontation and cried about it. If this went down like you said, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by talking to her.", "After reading a bunch of the comments, I don\u2019t think there is a clear YTA or NTA here. There are several things that need to be addressed.\n\nThe story: So many of you seem to think OP isn\u2019t being honest, and I agree it\u2019s possible that he could be downplaying the conversation to make himself look better. But you can\u2019t just assume that unless someone can point out a comment of his (or anyone actually involved in the story) that says otherwise. It seems a lot of people are calling him a liar to justify their YTA decision because of some reason or another (I suspect it has a lot to do with the belief that any time a parent talks to an education figure they assume if they aren\u2019t kissing that figure\u2019s ass then they must be confrontational and berating them for not thinking their kid is perfect - see below on that belief.) (Or I also suspect that people think men can\u2019t speak to other adults about curious questions or legit criticism without them being hostile and rude and since he is suggesting he wasn\u2019t either then he must be lying.)\n\nThe most popular reason I saw: Instructors shouldn\u2019t be questioned. Um excuse you? Yeah you should. Be it swim or coach or teacher. If you do something out of the norm with a child for whatever reason, a parent has the right to question it if only to understand. But because most of you assume he is lying or are working off past hostile confrontations with parents, you think that a parent asking anything is confrontational or hostile or entitled because they think their kid is perfect. If you do something like what this woman did, then you are allowed to question it especially so you can explain it to your child who at 4 might have her own curiosity about it. I agree that immediate hostility from a parent for doing something different with their child is problematic but there is no indication of that here other than the assumption that OP isn\u2019t being honest about the conversation.\n\nThe rowdy boys. You\u2019re all assuming that if the boys were really that rowdy that the manager should have done something about them. Exactly how rowdy were they being? Were they just being outgoing kids? If this man has a naturally shy child then most 4-5 years (especially those that have the comfort of a known person around them - siblings) are going to be a little more outgoing than her in comparison and that\u2019s just how he described them. If they were being obnoxious with bad behavior that\u2019s different but I\u2019d describe a lot of 4-5 year olds as rowdy most of the time.\n\nThis poor girl is naturally shy as is and she is being singled out and we don\u2019t know if or what explanation she was given by the manager other than the choice made her seem even more shy. Maybe dad just wants to explain to his daughter that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong or she isn\u2019t stupid or incapable to his kid so he asked why the manager took the action she did.\n\nI see the logic and reason behind most responses but given that I do I think we are now in a muddled grey area where we need more info from OP. I just am personally at I don\u2019t think OP is either in this situation. I think it\u2019s just a matter of interpretation from any involved or onlooking party (including us opinionated redditors).", "YTA", "Teach her yourself then for crap sakes.", "Nta.

Stay out of it!!!  Major YTA.  Parents:  shut up, sit on the sidelines and let these people work.", "YTA. \n\nI will bet anything that you were much more aggressive and rude that you state here.

It seems pretty likely to me that you weren't as polite as you think you were.\n\nTo me, a good rule of thumb is \"if the adult person I just confronted started crying afterward, I was probably an asshole and should be better in the future.\"", "NTA. You signed your daughter up for a specific group where she always performed well. If her instructors felt she suddenly regressed and could not continue training there they should have approached you and offered solutions. 4 yo is old enough to understand she was moved to the \"babies\" and being upset about it, switching her groups like that, in the middle of the training session, is a very unprofessional decision. The manager was probably crying because she realized she screwed up and you would report the incident, maybe she already had not so good history and was afraid to lose her job if one more complaint came through. Anyway it's not your problem, you were polite and handled the situation just fine.", "Unpopular opinion\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fNTA!", "Definitely NTA. First of all, singling her out in front of class is obviously a terrible teaching practice. This has been proven - humiliation is not helpful, if anything, it makes a nervous child more nervous. Toddlers are people and should be respected enough to at least take them aside and definitely talk to the parents before you take their child anywhere. \n\nSecond of all, all she knew was that the 4 year old looked nervous - has she never heard of anxiety? And that 4 year olds can have anxiety when things in their routine change? Should kids with anxiety not be allowed to learn to swim because they look nervous? Should they never move up from the 2 year old class because they consistently look nervous even at 10 or 11 years old? It wasn't even based on her skill level, just that she looked nervous. If it had anything to do with her skills or performance, I'd be more understanding, but it was simply because she looked nervous. Some kids look nervous all the damn time, doesn't mean they can't swim. Just stupid honestly. \n\nAnd last of all, crying was an overreaction if that's what she was crying about. Like way over the top - so much so that I can't help but assume something else was going on. If you had screamed, my opinion would change of you, but either way, she's an asshole or at least very misguided for her over the top reactions in both cases. \n\nAnd I got to say, I hate how, just because some parents are overbearing and verbally abuse their children's teacher, now no parent can ever talk to their child's teacher about a problem or they should just teach them themselves. Teachers are not always in the right just like parents are not always in the right and shouldn't be given the license to do whatever the fuck they want to children simply because being a teacher is hard. I guess just let your 4 year old fight her own battles..? Ridiculous.", "NTA! This sub has become disgustingly sexist. Because a male was involved, he was rude/mean/aggressive/blah, blah, blah.

The manager chose the easy way, undermining the daughter's  self confidence instead of being competent at her job. As for her crying, while we don't know if she was actually crying because of Op, if Op had been rude and intimidating, I am petty and  it comes to my mind  that not only daughter but also the manager was excessively nervous, and according to her own methods, she needed a time out from her managerial role.", "Absent more info, I think this is a little harsh. I\u2019ve taught swim, as well in my younger days.  While I agree that you want to minimize opportunity for negative experience, a big part of this is \u201cclassroom\u201d management.  Rowdy older kids and rotating teachers can absolutely throw a nervous kid into her shell.\n\nIf OP\u2019s daughter had done okay up to this point, there were a few things instructor could have done before removing her in the middle of class.

You can talk to dad and ask his thoughts on a class switch (manager wasn\u2019t teaching class from what OP describes).  \n\nIMO it would be better to have a parent of a 4 yo in the water with her the next lesson, than to teach a class of 2 yos with a pre-schooler.  While they might be on the same swim level, they will require totally different teaching approaches, attention spans, and likely different comfort level in pool. 2 year olds who start lessons tend to be fearless because they don\u2019t know any better.\n\nAs for manager crying, OP may have been a jerk.

The \u2018but\u2019 is that you have multiple kids in the class, and you have to keep eyes on all of them/keep them all engaged and safe. There isn\u2019t time to zero in on a child who is at a very different confidence level, because unlike in a classroom where you could assign some work/have the other kids do colouring or reading to work with a child who is behind, in the water, with kids around 4-5 years old, you need to keep eyes on and be engaging with them all constantly, otherwise they\u2019re liable to go and try to drown. The pool is a very high risk environment. Even one minute focusing on a single child is time that one of the other ones could decide to go off and drown. 4-5 year olds are runners sometimes. It\u2019s why lessons for the very little kids tend to be group games and quite contained space-wise - it\u2019s about getting them acclimatised to the water and confident, and kind of tricking them into learning gliding/kicking/floating/calling for help. A swimming teacher who has a group lesson can\u2019t spend the time that a parent or even a classroom teacher can with a single shy 4year old child who communicates like a shy 4 year old. \n\nI have taught classes of 12 4-5 year olds at once (where I live swimming lessons in school are mandatory). Where one turned out to be non verbal autistic. So I taught 11 children with one hand while holding the hand of the autistic boy and teaching two streams simultaneously. The 11 kids were mostly ready to move up by the end of the lesson period. The boy whose hand I held every second he was in water got acclimatised to having water gently poured over his head in the same time. You bet if I\u2019d had an option of a lower class with less students I\u2019d have sent him there in a jiffy. As it was his parents actually got be a box of chocolates at the end of the two weeks bc him tolerating crouching down so the water was up to his shoulders and getting his face wet were absolute no-goes for him at the start of classes. \n\nWith a big class of very little kids, in the water, realistically you can only give each individual kid a few seconds at a time bc you have to keep all the kids engaged and safe at all times. A very very shy and nervous child should be in a private lesson if the parents expect the teacher to spend ten minutes cajoling them into the water.\n\nEdit: I taught all levels of swimming between age 4-18 including bronze medallion. Never did toddler classes bc toddler class is just acclimatisation and trying to get them to reflexively float if they end up in water. Very important, but not my vibe.\n\nEdit 2: I absolutely have experienced parents kicking off about me moving their child to a different class - trust, we can spot very quickly if a child isn\u2019t ready/is in a lesson that is beyond them. I never once moved a kid to be mean to them or to single them out, it was always for their safety and wellbeing. I learned the hard way that some parents would lie about the level their kid was at bc they wanted their kid in the same class as their friend\u2019s kid so they could hang out while watching/they didn\u2019t know so they guessed/etc\u2026 we had to teach to the appropriate level for the whole class. If one child was significantly behind, we\u2019d be doing a disservice to the other children if we taught to the inappropriately placed child.

Once I was learning mental math and there were some kids my age whose parents always sat in the class as well. Their take was, \"My child can't grasp it yet, so I will learn it here and then teach them at home at their own pace\". the instructor was annoyed but allowed them nonetheless. Unsurprisingly, none of those kids were able to move beyond the elementary levels of the course.", "This phrasing specifically tries to avoid an accusation, in my opinion. \n\nIt completely and utterly implies that the speaker is the one who has a feeling and, depending on the tone, just wants that addressed.\n\nLike I said, the tone will make or break how this is received most of the time. being spoken to to explain.\n\nLike I said, the tone will make or break how this is received  most of the time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I noticed X happened and I have some concerns about it\n\nKeep in mind that X in this case is going to be \"You did X\" or \"This thing you did\" which will still be an accusation. Also, if you speak like this in the wrong tone people can assume you're talking down to them or being arrogant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think both of these statements can work if you say them right, honestly.", "He had an issue with how his daughter was treated and addressed it reasonable.

She has the time to talk to a student to try and see what's going on or she at the very least has the time to explain why the student is being moved. If she doesn't have the time to do so, she needs to trust her instructors to handle things without her or hire more people. \n\nMoving a student without any communication has a good chance to leave the student feeling negative about the experience which has a good chance to impact their willingness to do lessons and continue learning.\n\nThis idea that you don't have to communicate anything is ridiculous.", "> But in general, in situations like this, I default to the people with emergency training and not unqualified observers.\n\nAll well and good, but even if we both agree that the Swim Instructor Manage was in the right to handle it *exactly* how she handled it, that wouldn't inherently make OP wrong for expressing that he was concerned by how she did it and didn't like it. Just because she's in the right doesn't mean he's in the wrong for expressing disagreement. It isn't a binary like that. He's still a client presumably paying for his daughter to be taught and *is* allowed to express an opinion on it as a customer, *especially* to the *manager*. Hashing that out with a paying customer **is** the job of a manager.\n\nSo even then, that would be a NAH to me.", "A different view on this is that the manager actually has less info.

If you can't handle a nervous kid, you don't belong working with them as a teacher. Swimming is dangerous, being nervous is natural.", "And you're deliberately ignoring my point that if it WAS a safety issue, the manager handled the whole thing in about the absolute worst possible way. Who exactly was watching the rowdy boys and the other innocent girl while the manager was taking OP's kid to another class and making sure none of THEM drowned?", "Criticism.", "Without knowing whether he was unpleasant or not, I wouldn't like to judge , but it might have been a last straw situation if she was having a shitty week and that interaction was just too much on top of everything else.\n\nOr he could have been an asshole that crossed a line, who knows.", "Oh yes, the MANAGER makes next to nothing.

Do you have a moment?  I noticed that you moved (Daughter's name) to the younger age group for part of the lesson.  It seemed to me that she felt some embarrassment being moved out of her normal group.  She's been feeling a bit nervous lately with the inconsistency of swim instructors and some of the behaviors of her classmates and I'm concerned that she'll be further impacted by being moved.  I'd like to understand why you felt it was best to move her to the other class, so that I can reassure her later.\"\n\nNow, I would see that as perfectly respectful, but maybe you have a different take on it.", "So you're saying that because a male was involved, he's wrong?", "It\u2019s like a bell ringing to signify someone got an answer right, like from gameshows :)", "Ding ding ding is the \"correct answer!\" sound from game shows.", "It's accusatory because it assumes that the \"X\" in the statement \"I don't appreciate 'X'\" is actually what happened and it implies that X was wrong. It forces the recipient to either defend 'X' and explain why the speaker is wrong to be upset about it, or accept that X was indeed, wrong, and the speaker is owed some sort of apology, so it definitely is centered on the thing that happened and doesn't communicate that the speaker is leaving room for the possibility that they are missing context. It's just bad phrasing that is likely to put people on the defensive, no matter what the tone. Is it possible someone doesn't take offense? Sure.

Kids are volatile and pools are dangerous. If young kids are not in the emotional state to make their swim class safe, why is it so unreasonable to move them to a safer class for one part of one lesson?", "I think you're conflating things here. The swim instructors and the managers have different jobs. You're suggesting that because the manager was the one who pulled the kid then they have all the time to be patient with the child and get her comfortable in her class. But that's the instructor's job, not the manager's. The manager is not instructing, so cannot do the work to get the kid comfortable in the water in her class. The manager is there to manage, and that probably includes keeping an eye on ALL the classes that are happening and monitoring the overall safe condition of the pool. Managers don't have time to be individually meeting every single kid at their level. These kid swim classes are usually like a half an hour. That's why they have classes with designated skill levels.\n\nAnd the manager DID explain their reasoning for their decision when OP confronted them.\n\nI'm very confused by all of your criticisms of the manager here.", "Honestly, I don't care enough about this to engage further \ud83d\ude05 enjoy", "How do you mean \"pawned off\"?

You don't think that the mis-match in level isn't going to be a big distraction for THAT teacher?", "So then if there was more than one adult present for four kids, why did one kid have to be removed from the situation entirely (which only made her more upset, and they did apparently nothing to comfort or reassure her?) instead of one adult handling the rowdy boys and one adult staying with the two girls?"]}
