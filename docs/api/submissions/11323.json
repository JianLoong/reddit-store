I can understand that it must have been a rollercoaster of emotions to discover that they've known the whole time something you thought was a secret, but they did nothing wrong here.", "YTA", "NTA Not the asshole at all no one here is. It\u2019s a high tension moment and no one really wants to be laughed at when bearing their soul and they don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go. I get it just apologize and excuse yourself and be happy that you don\u2019t have homophobic parents.", "YTA . I honestly don't understand your response.  Did you want them to be evil and throw you out?? So she knew already.  She was probably waiting for the day you came out so they could discuss it openly.  \n\nI truly don't understand why you'd want a rift in your accepting family,  especially when there are other people banished from their families for the same thing.", "I know it\u2019s not what you expected or maybe what you needed (what did you need?) but this response on face value is not terrible. This IS fixable. You can talk like grown ups about how you would have had it a lot easier if they had been more open and not let you believe \u201cwho you are\u201d was a big secret\u2026also they might have perceptions about who you are that not based on who you truly are. What a beautiful starting point to grow, accept each other (we are all a mess) and heal and have a happy authentic life.", "YTA. Like huge. Your parents love you and have given you a wonderful start in life, without ever judging you or shaming you. They accepted you from day one and never wavered. You need to apologize and thank them from the bottom of your heart.", "YTA. Was the response less than you expected? Frankly, it's not an usual response by your parents because your mom pays attention to you and truly loves you. Please apologize. She did nothing wrong. She just wasn't surprised. So?", "YTA\n\nYour parents accepted you and knew who you were probably long before you did.\n\nIt seems like you're just upset that you didn't get a big dramatic reaction from them and because you didn't get it, you created your own drama.  You felt exposed because YOU created a scene to be exposed.", "YTA. Not for your initial reaction as maybe it\u2019s not how you envision the conversation, but she was trying to say they\u2019d always known and it didn\u2019t matter to them. Maybe she did it the wrong way but you need to see past that because nobody is going have your back more than your mom in this life. Anyway, your gay and nobody cares, so you can move on now.", "YTA. you have parents who are obviously supportive. They always knew and let you come to them on your own time. Plus they GAVE you a freaking house?? I don\u2019t know what your issue is but you need to apologize to your parents.", "NAH. Your parents sound accepting and perceptive. You are someone who sounds scared and high achieving, and you don\u2019t want to be vulnerable. Ok. Let your therapist know about your panic and the thoughts that you\u2019re having about what could happen if people know you\u2019re bi.

Running away never solves any problems.", "I don\u2019t think laughing is an appropriate reaction to coming out even if it\u2019s not malicious but you still over reacted massively. YTA and talk to your parents", "YTA and an ungrateful one to boot. Apologize to your parents as soon as possible.", "YTA. The \"big\" conversation you expected didn't go like you thought it would. But compared to so many, it went so well. And you had no communication and ran away? Those telling you screwed up are right - please listen.", "If you did actually cry to the point of an ambulance being called then it sounds like you need medical help. YTA , your reaction is so far over the top that it doesn't feel based in reality", "YTA - man you sound like the people who get upset because their parents don't make a giant deal when their kid comes out. Like you know how lucky you are to have accepting parents? Grow up", "YTA. All she did was say \"I knew for a long time\". She never tried to change you, never tried to push your sexuality. Why the over the top reaction?", "dude, it's your mom, mothers know their kids better than they know themselves and sounds like your mother is very accepting and kind, too bad her son didn't pick up any of that...\n\nYTA, you owe her a big apology for still throwing temper tantrums at 20.", "YTA what on earth is this? If you get so distraught over a lighthearted joke (that implies acceptance btw) that you almost need an AMBULANCE you ought to reevaluate your ability to function in society, let alone have an semblance of a romantic relationship. Apologize to your parents and appreciate their love and acceptance.", "Very soft YTA.  your parents respected your privacy and never confronted you about it. You come out to them, and they said they already knew. What's unkind about your parent's behavior or what your mom said in your opinion? It's totally fair that you felt exposed and possibly upset. But this is so much better than receiving death threats, getting kicked out, or being abused by your family. Take a breath and rethink the situation you are in. You are loved and cared about. Practicing communication and interpersonal skills will be your best bet in getting through this. Apologize to them and have an open conversation. You probably hurt their feelings just as much as you feel that you were hurt.", "I\u2019m bisexual. I\u2019m also the mother of a bisexual son. He\u2019s only 12 but he came out to me when he was 10 and honestly, I already knew. Many parents know instinctively. That\u2019s just what happens when you\u2019re completely responsible for another human being from day one of their existence. But it doesn\u2019t make me a mind reader. Do you know the specific fantasies of every other lgbt person? Jumping to that conclusion about your parents was totally irrational. I\u2019ve also seen you say in a few comments that you think they \u2018don\u2019t get you\u2019. This is clearly a projection. They DO get you - deeply - and you don\u2019t like it. You said as well that you think they should have known how you\u2019d feel. Your feelings aren\u2019t their responsibility; they\u2019re yours. Had your mom said something totally insensitive or homophobic, that would be different. But she didn\u2019t. She was telling you in an offhanded way that she already knew you were bi. She was trying to reassure you. This makes sense based on everything you said about how caring and supportive your parents are. A house! Plane tickets! You\u2019re allowed to feel overwhelmed and stressed. But you\u2019re not allowed to make your feelings anyone else\u2019s problem, and mental health struggles aren\u2019t a free pass for being immature.", "YTA. I understand that coming out can be a big deal, and maybe what your mom said wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear. \n\nBut what\u2019s the problem? You have a supporting family? Your parents knew and loved you regardless? Again, the way they said it may not have been Shakespearean, but you didn\u2019t have to practically cut your visit in half and leave.", "YTA", "NAH: You had a right to be upset even though they didn\u2019t intend to. Maybe in the future you and your parents can talk.", "It comes across like you wanted them to be horrified or something. I understand you have issues, which might explain your initial reaction, but beyond that? No, YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you have great parents. They clearly knew, but waited so you could come out yourself without them pressuring you.\n\nI really don't understand what more you could have wanted from them", "NAH. Mental health is intense and it can be really scary when someone says something you weren't expecting.", "YTA\u2026 you had the best case scenario and this was your reaction\u2026 not all of us get that lucky.", "Massive YTA. You need to own why you are \"feeling exposed\" from the fact that your parents guessed correctly something you tried to hide from them. They are not wrong for that. And if are feeling exposed then you need explore those feelings with a therapist instead of blaming your parents for your own feelings of vulnerability and being angry about how they reacted.

You've been through a lot mentally and you likely expected a completely different reaction from your parents. Your parents played it off as not a big deal. Sure, maybe they could have been more serious or seem more affected. Are you upset that none of your family talked about your identity before?

They cannot, however, read your mind. Nobody can. They might've stereotyped you from how you acted when you were younger, they might not have.

Also, sometimes straight people say some really tactless shit.

It doesn\u2019t matter if they were supportive if they use a joke like that. What straight people don\u2019t seem to understand is even if it\u2019s 2023, we still live in a world where most of us have to \u201ccome out\u201d. When someone comes out to you, whether you\u2019re a friend, parent, or whoever, and the FIRST thing you do is say you knew the whole time, you\u2019re an AH. \n\nYou take away the coming out from that person. OP was excited, nervous, and happy to come out and share his partner with his parents and they took that away from him even if it was a joke. You only get one coming out, so no, they DIDN\u2019T know. They assumed, probably because they stereotyped OP. That is being an AH point blank. They made they decision to make a stereotypical joke to their adult son in a vulnerable moment. It can be extremely emotionally taxing to come out even if you expect your parents to be ok with it. He\u2019s an adult and is allowed to turn around and leave.", "So you\u2019re upset because your parents knew you well enough that you couldn\u2019t come out properly? You\u2019re so dramatic.

Were you expecting high drama and didn't get it?  Your parents accepted you for what you are all along.  One of the lucky ones.", "YTA. You should have been happy that your parent had already accept you for who you are since the beginning.

They clearly had a hunch yet didn't say anything and let you come out to them in your own time.. literally could not be more supportive??", "YTA, and a major spoiled one at that.  Sounds like your parents never had any issue with your sexuality, spoiled you by giving you a house when you turned 18, and now because they acknowledged their knowledge of your sexuality and that they're accepting of who you are you throw a tantrum and go NC?   Grow TF up, apologize to them for being such an AH, and be grateful for the wonderful family you have and the many blessings you received from them.", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think your mom had any ill intentions towards you, she was trying to make the situation lighthearted with a joke while still letting you know that she loves and accepts you no matter what and that she understands that\u2019s just who you are. Sometimes it may feel embarrassing and undermining, as if all your struggles with sexuality meant nothing when everyone knew what you were before you, or that this really big step for you to come out turned out to be a joke (it almost makes the effort feel pointless?)- and that\u2019s why it\u2019s okay to be reasonably a little upset that maybe their reactions didn\u2019t live up to how you wanted it to be. I don\u2019t think how you responded was okay though, that\u2019s concerning and atypical behavior to have at an acceptance joke (even if it was bit insensitive on some level, it wasn\u2019t so insensitive that it warranted crying like that). You should communicate that you are okay and explain why you reacted that way, and maybe find a more effective therapist.", "YTA, apologize to your parents they obviously love you no matter what that\u2019s a relationship you don\u2019t want to ever give up on.

They are human. You can tell them how this made you feel. They may or may not change/apologize, but at least you are giving them a chance. Both my parents were supportive when I came out as trans, but they still made it awkward and uncomfortable by asking invasive questions. They had an even worse reaction when I told them I have adhd so, parents are confusing.

Your parents have been supportive of you long before you came out and never treated you differently. They have known this entire time but waited until you were comfortable.

It\u2019s seems like your parents will be there for you no matter what. \nSaying that, it must have been hard for you to openly come out and the feelings of vulnerability and exposure are valid! But I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t mean it the way it was taken\u2026 leaving and cutting communication was a very AH move; now the dust has settled, call them, tell them you love them and apologise for leaving abruptly while you were emotional.", "YTA\n\nMy face got introduced to the wall when I came out to my birthgiver.

Than being seen can feel very overwhelming.\n\nThe thing is, that fear has little to do with your parents. They aren't that people who can hurt your or for that matter would. You read their support as danger and even with reason, that's still on you. \n\nVideocall your parents. Apologize. Talk it over and explain what happened. I think they will be there for you. Listen to the people in your live. \n\nBTW asking your therapist if, should time zones allow it, if you could have some sessions together. I think late afternoon sessions in our timezone might be morning sessions for them. Those might work.", "Your reaction was ridiculous. Your mother was telling you she already knew, loved you, nothing changed. Whatever you have built up in your head, coming out is not all shock and parties to celebrate.\n\nThis is what LGBTQ+ have been protesting for, acceptance without judgement. Surely the ideal is that people should be able to say 'I'm gay/trans/ace\" etc and the reaction is the same as saying something like dating someone new, starting a course, having found an ideal pair of jeans.

Why does it need to be a big tear fest? I can understand that the relief of the fears (mentioned in my last paragraph) could make the person coming out emotional.

They are showing how, to them, the person\u2019s orientation is just another part of them that the family accepts and loves. \n\nI expect down votes, but understand I\u2019m no trying to be an AH myself\u2026 as a straight person I don\u2019t understand it, but I want to.

My sister had similar challenges, and I know it can be such an exhausting drain. Your mom meant that she knew you were gay, and nothing deeper-level than that. Even if it wasn't how you hoped she would react (fair!), she was very likely trying to reduce your anxiety around disclosing what may have felt like a big, burdensome secret.

Were you wanting a big scene of disrespect so you could justify a negative story in your mind?

I am just not getting what kind of response you were hoping for.  \n\nI get people can build up things in their minds with all sorts of internal narratives, but finding out that your parents understood who you were all along and supported you fully seems like a strange reason to go NC.

I can understand not reacting to that well, and it sounds like you\u2019re in the process of trying to get therapy. At the same time, I can understand your parents\u2019 perspective. They may have wanted you to feel more relaxed, like it is not a big deal to them. By getting as upset as you did followed by immediately leaving, there wasn\u2019t an opportunity for clear communication about their intentions and about your feelings about the comment. It sounds like you live far enough away that any resolution of the conflict would not be had in person, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nThe reason I say NAH is mainly because I don\u2019t think coming out is ever easy, and any comment that can be construed as dismissive should not be the response given.

I would be double over laughing then tell him to give me whatever he hid under his pillow or blanket. \n\nIf you think most parents are oblivious today to what their kids are up to you are sadly mistaken. Yes, there are still times where coming out of the closet can be dangerous or cause a lot drama but it isn't anything like it used to be. For many kids at least in western culture coming out of the closet has just become silly. \n\nWhy did you really get mad about what your mom said and how it was handled?", "Many people who come out WISH they had your outcome. You\u2019re not an asshole but you\u2019re emotionally immature and ruined a trip your parents PAID FOR.

The people realize that your parents if they are loving and kind know you better than anyone else in the world. There was no judgment there was no screaming sounds like there was love from everybody but you. You're upset because your parents knew you were gay I'm sure other people knew but didn't say anything because they respected you.\n\nYou need to apologize to your parents and make amends and if this bothers you that much then you need to get therapy.

Your parents reacted with the latter. What were you wanting? Were you wanting them to cry and say they love you no matter what? Were you wanting them to scream at you about it\u2019s not natural? Were you wanting a simple \u201cokay?\u201d There was nothing wrong with their reaction. \n\nI get the stress that comes with the pressure that comes with coming out of the closet. Your parents were waiting for you to come out on your own terms. I understand the release of emotion that comes with coming out but Jesus your reaction was extreme. It seems like you wanted to either be a victim or have a dramatic performance where they rallied around you to show you love, and since you didn\u2019t get that you threw a fit and flew back to Europe. You\u2019re being dramatic and your family is right, you owe them an apology. \n\nToo many people are attacked by family after coming out of the closet and you want to be the victim because your family supported you and responded with humor?

I guess she could have reacted differently, but why would you want her to? Is this not indicative that a) your mother knows you very well as any good mother should, b) that she respected you enough to let you come out on your own time, and c) that she was always supportive of you and your sexuality even before you came out? Maybe you wanted some shock factor or conflict cause I can see no logical reason as to why this reaction is not favorable.", "I think you did a lot to try and hide yourself and it probably cost you a lot to do that, mentally. And then you suddenly learned that not only did you not have to do that, you didn't even do it well enough that you fooled them. \n\nWhich is rough. You must of spent years being constantly vigilant and aware all the time thinking you were protecting a secret that was actually painted on you in ink they could see plainly. \n\nI understand how much of a shock it could of been to learn all that energy spent was for nothing. \n\nHowever, you need to understand that although your feelings are valid this was not a 'bad' or unsupportive response by your parent.

Then you totally flipped out and fled to the other side of the planet. They have not reached out to you. That\u2019s reasonable. You completely came undone on them, because, in your opinion, your mum was too light hearted in her response. I would venture that your folks are very hurt and confused. They likely don\u2019t know what went wrong and are trying to give you your space.  \nYour mental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility. You your paranoia and intrusive thoughts caused you to behave in a truly terrible way. You owe your parents an explanation and a real apology.

Honestly from your post and comments it seems like you\u2019re throwing a pity party for the fact that you don\u2019t have a party thrown for you or some elaborate story to tell? It feels like you\u2019re creating this identity for yourself that revolves around you being bisexual and you\u2019re upset other people in your life aren\u2019t defining who you are by your sexuality. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely your fault because media overpopulates the idea that everything needs to be over-the-top and elaborate. With that said, you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re acting like a child. You should really take a deeper look at your reaction with your therapist because they way you\u2019re fabricating the series of events in your comments really feel like some sort of delusion that stems from other areas of your like or mental health issues.", "Info:  why did you start crying, and why did you feel exposed?", "YTA.\nWhat other extravagant expectations you might have had aside, your coming out was like a dream compared to millions of others.

It sounds to me like they were very accepting of you and that they were expecting you at some point to tell them this exact thing.  Are you upset because they weren't surprised?  Did you want your coming-out to be more dramatic?  I'm sorry of I'm not understanding the problem, but this sounds like you're upset that your parents know who you are and are fine with it.

You owe them an apology.", "I would say it's a soft YTA. I say that coming from the perspective of a non-binary person that's come out. I agree with many others in that everyone's experience with coming out is different, and for our families, there are tons of different ways they can respond. While making light and teasing you was not the greatest reaction, it is not the worst at all. You have a family who seemed ready to accept you as you are, which is a lot more than many LGBTQIA people. \n\nI would reach out to your parents and just express that while you are appreciative for their acceptance, but the delivery could have been better. Also, take the time to apologize for your behaviour, but explain where it came from. Coming out is such an emotional event with entire relationships riding on it (depending on the person) so they might not understand why you were so upset.

I know, from my own brother's experience that this is a difficult thing to go through, but I'm confused by your response. Your family already knew and they were waiting for you to tell them.

You are extremely lucky to have parents like that.", "You were very, very vulnerable in that moment, and your mom\u2019s comment was dismissive of what, for you, was a long journey of self realization. It hurt because it feels invalidating of something that took you *effort*. It hurt because she easily figured out something that for you was *hard.* These are all valid feelings, but feelings that don\u2019t typically result in parents needing to call an ambulance.\n\nYour parents realized you might not be straight, and, instead of pushing or asking, they let you figure that out for yourself at your own pace. That\u2019s one of the kindest things parents can do for their LGBTQ children. Yes, her joke was likely inappropriate for the vulnerability of the moment, but the *sentiment* behind it is truly sweet. She\u2019s saying to you that they knew, but it was just a part of *you*- the you that she loves. \n\nTheir reaction was disappointing, but disappointment *shouldnt* be earth shattering. For you, it was. It might be time to find a new medication, therapy, or therapist to help you cope with feelings of hurt and disappointment because at this moment you\u2019re punishing your family for *your* overwhelming feelings. It might take time, but your parents deserve forgiveness for this small mistake and you\u2019re going to have to do the work to be capable of it. At the end of the day, a lot of people on here would do anything to have received that kind of response from their parents rather than hate and abuse. You owe it to yourself, your parents, and your future to put as much effort as possible into learning to cope with your feelings.

Yes, coming out is a big deal. I\u2019ve seen stories like this before where kids come out to parents or friends and nobody is surprised because they already knew. People have been a bit salty or annoyed/upset by the jokey responses, but to this level sounds extreme. \n\nI understand if it was surprising so maybe you took a bit of space, but crying to that degree. Then basically wasting the thousands of dollars they spent to bring you to them? Very over the top.\n\nYou definitely should continue the therapy and figure out why it was so shocking to you that your loved ones already had it figured out.

I imagine you\u2019re going to have a fantastic support system going forward. And I do think you should call them and apologize for leaving without saying anything. But at the same time, if you feel like they were dismissive with their comments, verbalize that. It honestly sounds like you just felt dismissed when it happened, and I don\u2019t think there are any AH\u2019s in this situation. A few months ago, there was a post from a mother who said something very similar when her kid came out, and everyone ripped into her, saying that the comment comes across as dismissive to the child coming out. That applies here.", "You sound to delicate for life", "INFO: why did you react by crying? \n\n(For context, I'm bisexual myself and while it's a long time since I came out, I'd have been seriously relieved at that kind of reaction, so I'd like more context to understand what happened.)", "YTA.

You can't control anyone else's reaction to it.\n\nIf what you describe as your mother's reaction is really the only fallout from coming out to your parents, then really the only criticism I can make of them is that your mum's response was perhaps not the most tactful thing ever. It doesn't sound like any threats were made; it doesn't sound like there was any anger or any contempt for who you are as a person.

I'll try to reword what they said because it was very insightful.\n\nThe parent in that post also said something about knowing their child was LGTBQ for most of their life. The child had a similar reaction.\n\nBasically this was the commenter's explanation: The child had spent a lot of their life afraid that being themselves would put them in danger. They likely tried to hide their identity as a protective mechanism. The felt safe because no one knew. When they were ready to share their identity, it was their choice. By stating that the parent knew all along, there was an implication that the child was never able to hide their identity. Basically, that they were so obviously LGBT that it was not the child's choice to come out and that everyone knew. The thought that they could not hide their identity/sexuality even if they wanted removed the safety of being in the closet.\n\nAdditionally, coming to terms with your sexuality can be a very complicated and nonlinear process. There's homophobia and biphobia to navigate. There's confusion about feeling different things than what your peers are feeling and wondering if it's ok. The fact that the parent said they knew all along (from when OP was 7) even before OP knew this aspect of their identity (they figured out they were bi at 15) really minimizes that journey to self acceptance and self understanding.\n\nComing out is a big moment even if you get a completely positive reaction. By implying that it's not the OP's choice to come out (because everyone already knows) removes the agency and also minimizes how important of a moment that was.\n\nI think OP's parent was well meaning, and I definitely think OP may have reacted too strongly. But I can understand where those feelings are coming from.

I knew my child was not hetero from the time they were 3. A good attentive parent knows.", "There are many tools that parents can use to monitor the internet usage of their minor children that are not defeated by VPNs and incognito windows.", "Evidently not...", "I understnd that this was not the reaction you were hoping for. It is never pleasant to share news with someone and be met with an \"I know\". But it does seem like they were well-intentioned and willing to make things right.if all they said was that the closet was glass, it's likely that they weren't reading your mind or your search history, and that they don't know your innermost thoughts and desires. They just observed you growing up and recognized patterns in your behavior that likely led them to question whether or not you were straight.", "And you weren't as good at hiding it as you thought. So what?", "that\u2019s assuming it\u2019s a secret. lots of people don\u2019t realize they are gay THEMSELVES much earlier than they come out to their parents. It feels like it devalues their struggle to come to terms with it when the parents are like \u201cyeah we knew the whole time\u201d. It\u2019s not a dissimilar feeling to when someone tells you \u201ci told you so\u201d. It just not the right thing to hear/say, even if it is true.", "dodging the question lol nice", "I am actually at the last resort before Ketamin. Even If I am not honest,my boyfriend is always present at that appointments and tells them everything,even if I don't want. I also have a diary of symptoms and will probably show this reddit post to my therapist who is also a psych and works with my doctor who is also a psychiatrist that writes these medications.\n\nThe problem is,even though everyone says this is paranoid,I don't feel that paranoid panic at all. My thoughts are really in an order, not mixing with each other.", "It feels irrational but it is a yes to the both questions. \n\nI know I have a problem but they didn't make it better. They made me think at that moment unless I close myself to an Iron room,I would be easily intruded. I wish they have just listened to me and said we love you,not a joke on how I am easily readable by them. They should have known this is.my biggest fear if they knew me.that well as they thought.", "Ah, fair point. I definitely wasn't clear enough.", "In fact it may have been all the extra trying that hinted at it in the first place...", "That's a great story. What an awesome grandma.", "Wow, THAT early?!? I would think it would take until at least 5, and usually more like 7.", "you panicked and broke down while having anxious thoughts about what else your parents might know about you, if that is not paranoid what else is?", "But your thoughts are not rational and organized.  You irrationally  go to everyone  knows everything I have ever thought and you spiraled on that irrational thought to the point of being paranoid  that people  could read your private thoughts. That is paranoia.", "You desperately need to book an emergency session with your therapist. And maybe add another therapy session a week. Your responses and reactions are troubling to say the least.Your thoughts are not in order and you are indeed very paranoid. 5 years ago when i was bad off i was in \"partial\" inpatient after I was released from the hospital. Meaning i went 5 days a week from 9-2. It helped me a lot. Maybe you can find a similar program", "Paranoia does not necessarily cause thoughts to scramble. It does cause a lack of trust in others and often catastrophesizing, which your posts do show. You need some help mate, that kind of internal talk is painful and draining in the extreme.", "You panicked so hard at your parents\u2019, which was actually quite positive, believing such extremes that everyone around you can read your mind and know your deepest thoughts. That is the thought process of extreme paranoia.", "I say this gently, you\u2019re thoughts are not in order. Speaking from experience. It took me ages to figure out which are intrusive thoughts and which are valid concerns, and what are anxiety or bipolar induced reactions vs valid expression. For example, you say you immediately went to \u201ceveryone knows and they now know every thought I\u2019ve ever had\u201d leading to hysteria. A healthy response would have been \u201cok but WHY do you say that.\u201d Fact finding and ordering your thoughts logically rather than emotionally. \n\nFor me personally, unmedicated me is a hot mess. Violent mood swings with the flip of a switch, intrusive thoughts, reacting with emotion immediately\u2014medicine quiets those reactions enough that I can reflect on those thoughts and emotions and adjust my reaction to them. Please please talk openly to your doctor and don\u2019t be afraid to try medicine, some of us just weren\u2019t given the right brain chemistry and there\u2019s no shame if you\u2019re one of us!", "BF needs to leave therapy asap, unless this is couples therapy? Is there a reason he is always present during appointments?", ">The problem is,even though everyone says this is paranoid,I don't feel that paranoid panic at all. My thoughts are really in an order, not mixing with each other.\n\nJust because a delusion is convincing doesn't mean it isn't a delusion. \n\nYour thoughts may be in order, but that just means that one leads into the other. It doesn't mean that your thoughts are logical or rational. It doesn't mean your conclusions are based on reality. It doesn't mean your resulting feelings, though genuine, are justified by any semblance of truth. \n\nWith all due respect, you really need to go back to your therapist. Your meds are not working - you are not emotionally regulated. In fact, you are showing severe emotional disregulation. It doesn't matter that you feel clear-headed. You have surrounded yourself with trusted people who have all told you that your reaction was paranoid and extreme - and you know you cannot trust your emotional reactions so you ought to have the sense to rely on these trusted people instead. \n\nAnd to highlight WHY your thoughts, while connected, are completely illogical... You are judging strangers and the world at large by the standard of your family and then panicking at that ridiculous assumption. To make this simple: your close friends and family pay a lot of attention to you, and have done so since you are very small. They have watched you go through puberty, have been around when you first discovered your sexuality, and gotten to know you extremely well. Since they have known you since you were young and still developing, they would have been able to observe you and who/what you're curious about when you were still young to mask well if you wanted to. It's like a little kid saying they didn't eat a cookie while their mouth is surrounded by cookie crumbs, these are people who (in a good family that pays attention) had a very good chance to observe your behaviour and know you intimately. So while not every good parent knows or suspects, it is NOT a shock that many do.\n\n**This does not mean you were stripped bare to the world.** Strangers don't know you that well, don't know the face you make when you lie, don't know that you used to stare at the boys in movies while growing up. It is a false conclusion to think that because the people closest to you knew your secrets, everyone knew. \n\nAnd damn, this reaction was so unreasonable! Your family didn't react perfectly, but it was *really* damn close. Yes, they made you realized you hadn't been hidden from them, but look at their reaction: unconditional love and support. They have zero reservations or hangups. That is *wonderful.*\n\nBut you are choosing to judge them against a script in your head, a script they do not have access to. Since their reaction didn't perfectly follow your script, you cannot handle it and are punishing them. This is completely unreasonable - and frankly, a cruel standard to hold people to. You basically set your family up to fail and that isn't okay.\n\nIf you had just been hurt that they knew but didn't tell you or worried if anyone else knew, I would say this is an easy NAH. But because you took it so far and are cutting them out of your life simply for failing to follow a script they weren't privy to, I have to call you TA.\n\nYou aren't a bad person, OP, but your reaction to this was not okay.", "Ya something else big is happening here. \n\nBuddy your mom wiped your ass. Of course you were exposed to her. \n\nThis is a really strange reaction to have. She noticed you like other boys. She\u2019s not privy to all your thoughts. \n\nLast time I went home my dad got me sourdough bread. It\u2019s not because he was intruding my subconscious it\u2019s because he raised me and noticed my preferences. \n\nI think you should take up your boyfriends request to meet with your parents. He\u2019s obviously concerned about you and your family is giving you space because of this freak out.", "So no matter what you would have had a problem with what they said, had a huge emotional reaction and then fled the country.", "No, they didn't make you feel that way. They reacted normally, and YOU felt that way. \n\nYou can't control what other people tell you. You can only control how you react to it. Your parents aren't the problem.\n\nThey do know you, btw. They knew your sexuality even better than you thought they would. By your own admission.", "YTA It wasn't them. It was YOU. You overthink about yourself and expect others to understand YOUR thoughts.", "Op, you have a pretty extreme sense of paranoia that is out of proportion with reality. You should find a therapist and work on that.", "Dude get off Reddit and write in a journal or read. You're too caught up in your own head right now. \n\nThey knew you were queer, but they can't read your mind.", "So it's their fault they didn't pander to you so you wouldn't have an irrationally negative reaction?\n\nYou have no idea how much other people wish they had parents as accepting as yours.\n\nYTA.", "They should have known you\u2019d be mad they knew you well enough to know you were bisexual and they should have known you\u2019d be mad that they were accepting and waited until you were ready to come out to tell you they knew? Really? You\u2019re mad they didn\u2019t predict your insanely irrational reaction, and cut them out of your life over nothing. They weren\u2019t cruel, judgmental, hateful, all they did wrong was not expect you to take them telling you they knew you were bi like they said something horrible. You freaked out because they knew you so well that it wasn\u2019t a surprise. That was not a reaction they should have expected, it\u2019s not them \u201cnot knowing you\u201d, it\u2019s you being unreasonable and irrational. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re upset that your parents weren\u2019t surprised you were bi and were loving and supportive when you came out.", "Look into emotional intelligence no one can make you think anything, YTA but cbt could really help", "You're creating a logical paradox. They know you well enough to see into all these dark secrets and thoughts, but they don't know you well enough to know their response was going to be taken horribly and send you spiraling? You're twisting your own logic to make those two realities truth, when they can't coexist.\n\nYou are self sabotaging. The person causing you the most harm right now is you. \n\nI know that doesn't make this an easy fix. I've had intense panic attacks. My anxiety has gotten severe enough to cause my vocal cords to close and block my air. My anxiety has even triggered anaphylaxis. I have empathy for how overwhelming it can be, and it's why I think you're stuck in a self-exacerbating loop. You need to recognize it so you can try to break it. You're spiraling, and your doctor needs to step up your care to get this back to a tolerable level, so you can work through it with your therapist.", "Well, I jumped straight in with snark without asking any questions, so\u2026 :)", "I guess I technically didn't know until I was told when they were 16. But yeah, there were a few specific instances as young as 3 that made me and a few other close relatives think 'probably not hetero'."]}
