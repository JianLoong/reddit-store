My younger sister (17F) stayed at home for my wedding because, as she  was sick and couldn\u2019t come. Since there was no other way to reschedule it, we had to just do it without her. Although I was somewhat disappointed, I didn\u2019t care too much about it because at least she what a good reason not to go.   \n\n\nWell, four days later, our security camera wasn\u2019t working, so I fixed it and was looking at the security footage on our security camera the day of my wedding when I saw my sister exit the house via the front door. Well, I thought that was a little suspicious. I then saw her get into a car, but then I realized that the car she got into was her boyfriend\u2019s car and put two in two together: she wasn\u2019t sick, she skipped out on one of the biggest days of my life to hang out with her boyfriend. \n\nFast forward to today, I barely talked to her after confronting her despite her apologizing multiple times. I\u2019ve since then bought my own house and my wife has moved in, and I\u2019ve decided to not attend her high school graduation in May. Once I told my parents and her that, she started crying saying it wasn\u2019t fair for me to still keep a grudge on her and that she\u2019s apologized so many times and is so sorry. I told her it wasn\u2019t fair for her to skip out on my wedding just so she could hang out with her BF (who is now her ex). My dad keeps on saying \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d and I should make things up with her. But I\u2019ve told my dad unless she learns her lesson, I\u2019m not going to attend any of the major events in her life. My dad says that\u2019s an AH move. My mom agrees.

She picked some flash in the pan boyfriend over her brother\u2019s wedding. I\u2019ve seen people pull stuff like this-going to a girl/boy friend\u2019s family event or some nonsense instead of a family member\u2019s event. I remember one girl who went out drinking all day with her friends instead of going to her brother\u2019s graduation. \n\nBut this is next level. She skipped your wedding to hang out with some guy. Yeah, I don\u2019t blame you for not letting this go. It\u2019s not even about forgiveness, I\u2019d find it difficult to trust or expect anything from her again. And please, don\u2019t anyone give me the \u201cshe\u2019s a teenager\u201d bs. She knew how important a wedding is.", "NTA but listen to your wife. She\u2019s clearly suggesting that you move on in a subtle way. Sis will always need to explain why she\u2019s not in any picture well into the future to family and friends. That\u2019s enough punishment.", "She was a stupid teen who made a bad decision and apologized.\nYou are an adult - if being petty and holding a grudge will make you feel better, go for it.\nOut of curiosity, did she attend your graduation?", "NTA", "NTA \n\nShe was old enough to know the possible consequences of her actions.", "ESH. \n\nYes, she was massively wrong. \n\nYour dad is right in that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. \n\nBut you\u2019re also being petty. You claim she needs to learn her lesson. How do you suppose she do that? Because if your answer is by you not attending an important event in her life, that\u2019s not teaching her a lesson. That\u2019s simply you getting revenge.", "I\u2019m going to go NTA, though reluctantly because telling someone 6 months in advance you aren\u2019t going to their graduation just signs like you wanting to hurt her and have a tantrum. But also, she\u2019s a teenager and teenagers aren\u2019t exactly known for thinking through consequences (they literally can\u2019t yet). \n\nIt\u2019s not going to serve you or your family to hold this grudge from now on. I agree, her verbally apologizing feels hollow, but you need to think about what she CAN do to make it up to you. You and your wife should talk together about what actions would make the apology feel sincere. Then I\u2019d sit down and ask your parents what *they* think is a fair and reasonable restitution she can do to \u201cmake things up to you\u201d as she can never go back and actually attend your wedding. And you and your family should come to an agreement about how this can be repaired.", "NTA, but your dad is right in saying that two wrongs don't make things right. She is a stupid seventeen years old. We all have done things we regret at seventeen. Unless you want to completely sever ties with her moving forward, I would recommend you to seriously consider going to it.", "NTA\n\nShe disregarded deliberately one of the most important events of your life  - return the favor.\n\nYou've told her why. Let her deal with it.", "NTA but as someone older, consider if you might regret missing that one event. Not a whole lifetime of big events.", "NTA but she\u2019s a teenager. She made a dumb and selfish decision. She apologized for it. You barely talk to her and now you\u2019re telling her six months in advance that you won\u2019t be attending her graduation. Where does this end? Is it your plan to boycott every special event in her life forever? If you don\u2019t want to go to the graduation in order to prove a point, that\u2019s fine but after that you need to drop it and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That was a huge FU on her part, and it\u2019s going to take a lot to put that behind you. But there are times where you can teach a lesson by being the bigger person, and this could be one of those times. Saying something like \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can truly appreciate how hurt I was that you chose to not be there for one of the most important days of my life, and for as angry and devastated I still feel when I think about it I don\u2019t want to be the person who is responsible for causing you as much pain as you caused me. So I will be at your graduation, because that\u2019s what family does.\u201d", "Don\u2019t go, it\u2019s the only way she will learn.", "NTA  but she is still just a kid and kid's are notorious for making bad decisions.  I don't disagree with your decision but please make a way for her to dig out of the whole she dug.", "NTA", "YTA not really a full blown A but why not just go there, mend the relationship and be the bigger person without rubbing it into her face?", "I'm interested in this as well.  How does OP want her to show that she's \"learned her lesson\"?\n\nI can (maybe) see skipping one major event, but not all of them as he has planned.", "This is the way. Get her to do something special at an anniversary of yours.\n\n\n2nd wedding day, 10th year of dating... Dunno.\n\nJust give her a Chance to let her show she Supports you, your marriage and wife. Just what she did not Do at your wedding.\n\nShe can arrange a date night, cook, make a cake for you to enjoy, write a few nice things, take pictures of you three to show the connection you have...\n\nThere are a tons of way to show this, but she need to know what she could Do. Just tell her you will miss every milestone in her life is also not right.\n\nGive her a chance. But she has to learn that musding such an important moment takes more to make up just a few words", "I said the same thing. I knew people were going to use the \u201cshe\u2019s a teenager\u201d or \u201cshe made a mistake\u201d and sure enough you can see it in the comments. I did plenty of stupid things as a teenager, but there was a limit and I wouldn\u2019t have ditched a family wedding to hang out with some girl.", "He\u2019s not holding a grudge, he\u2019s holding her accountable.", "Exactly this. He should not attend the graduation,in fact he and the wife should make it a point to do something fun. After this at some point soon after,the healing needs to start. This shouldn\u2019t be permanent."]}
