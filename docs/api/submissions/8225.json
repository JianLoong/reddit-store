You did not want him to be legally your father which is fair enough. But as he is not, he has no obligation to leave you anything in his will. 10% is better than nothing, which is what you could have been left.", "YTA\n\nYou claim that it's \"not about money\" and in the same breath are angry that you're not getting the same amount as everyone else. In a way, he's right... You still have a relationship with a parent that your siblings don't have.... It stands to reason that your bio dad will be leaving you something that your siblings will not be getting....", "YTA\n\nYou simply can't have it both ways. You chose to forgive your bio dad and have him in your life. He is legally and morally your dad. Your step dad has accepted this, sounds like, well. He hasn't pushed more of an relationship on you than you have wanted. But then, you cannot pick and chose when he is your dad and should treat you like his legal child, when you didn't want that. Because what you're now seeing from his will and inheritance divide is how you have built your relationship from his POV. He's been your stepdad, stepping up once I  a while like a father, when you needed and allowed it. This is how it looks from inheritance POV. \n\nYour stepdad isn't being petty or punishing you, he's simply following the parental limitations and role you've wanted with him.", "I\u2019ll go against the grain on this a little. \n\nEquitably doesn\u2019t mean 30-30-30-10, and also just because he adopted the other children doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t adults. They are all functionally his kids. You are a step child and therefore worth less? \n\nNAH. You just found out that he values you less than them. Its totally fine to be pissed off about that. Its also within his rights to value you less if he wants to.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you are supposed to just be super cool with all this. You just found out that someone you thought of as a dad has a ranking system, and you are last.", "NAH. You shouldn\u2019t have equated money with how much he cares maybe, but I know that it\u2019s easy to say that and not easy to feel. \nI am my dad\u2019s only bio daughter, he never adopted my sisters, cuz that isn\u2019t really done in the UK, but things will be split 3 ways between us. \nAnd do you actually know if you will get anything from your bio dad? If you won\u2019t will that change anything in your stepdads mind? Is there any resentment from him that you didn\u2019t get adopted by him? \nLots of questions here still.", "NTA. He is being petty over you not choosing to be legally adopted by him, which shouldn\u2019t matter because a piece of paper doesn\u2019t define a relationship. I would decline his inheritance all together.", "It is understandable that you would be upset about the distribution of your stepdad's inheritance, as you have a close relationship with him and consider him to be a father figure in your life. However, it is also important to understand that your stepdad has a legal and parental relationship with your siblings and therefore may feel a stronger sense of responsibility to provide for them in the event of his passing.\r  \n\r  \nIt is also important to remember that inheritance is ultimately a personal decision and your stepdad has the right to distribute his assets as he sees fit. While it may be disappointing for you, it is ultimately his decision to make.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like your stepdad and you both have valid perspectives and feelings on the matter, and it may be helpful to have a calm and respectful conversation with him to express your thoughts and feelings on the matter, and to hear his reasoning. It is also important to remember that money is not the most important thing in a relationship and that you should value the love and support that he has given you throughout the years.", "Nta. This hits me right in the feels. \nOn my fathers side, I\u2019m getting snubbed of my entire inheritance bc my mother\u2019s family has stuff to give me. My maternal grandmother is in a tough place, I have an adoptive cousin who has 3 parents and he\u2019s inheriting from all of them (he will inherit more than everyone). Two substantial things were taken from my mother (and by extension me) to give to him just to make him feel more included. This is extremely tough to navigate. Do I feel shafted? Kind of. But I don\u2019t feel like I can or should be able to complain. Try to be kind and understanding. You\u2019re entitled to feel shitty over this. Your stepdad is struggling w this as well. I\u2019d recommend to avoid feeling entitled to inheritance, it helps me anyway.", "YTA. You have three parents to inherit from. Your step-siblings have two.", "ESH. There was a better way for the step-dad to introduce this.

No because that\u2019s a down and dirty thing to do to someone you supposedly love and treat as their own.", "YTA. You sound like one of those money grubbers who come out of the woodwork when the word \"inheritance\" is uttered. You have no relation to him, never asked him to adopt you (which he clearly would have agreed to as he did your siblings), and therefore are not his family. He is completely correct. Your \"great relationship\" is immaterial. I have some friends I am very close to, but I would be baffled beyond belief if they gave me a stake in their will equal to their children.", "YTA\n\n You can't have it both ways.", "NTA/NAH. \n\nYour bio dad,  has he left anything to your siblings,  even though they've been adopted? \n\nHas his son,  your mum adopted been left stuff by bio mum? \n\nIf yes - point it out.

I had an easier time with our bio dad which I also acknowledge which made it easier to forgive him and maintain a relationship. Also, I am grateful that I was included, I didn\u2019t intend for this to come off like I\u2019m not grateful.", "I don\u2019t think its really the money for them. Its more that she found out where she is ranked.", "So you made your choice of forgiving your bio dad and he's your legal dad, yet you still going to get 10% from Jimmy, that's a generous offer and you're grateful. So what's the problem? YTA for being the petty one while accusing Jimmy for being petty.", "1. you have access to inheritance from both your bio dad and step dad. Adopted siblings only have stepdad. \n2. It\u2019s Jimmy\u2019s wealth and he gets to decide how it\u2019s allotted\n3. As an adult, no other adult \u201cowes\u201d you anything. You made a choice not to be adopted, he made a choice to prioritize his legal children over his stepchild. That is how choices work.", "I take back my YTA. You actually sound like a nice, reasonable person. Perhaps your stepdad took what you said the same way I did. It sounds like Ally definitely took it that way.\n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly now, you weren't upset because you were getting less money, but because it made feel like you're less of a daughter to him than your siblings?", "Why is it fair for her to rank step-dad as not her father, but not for him to do the same? OP can feel however she feels, but actively complaining about it when she has made her own choice makes her an asshole", "Perhaps Jimmy also sees you as less of a daughter than the siblings that chose to be adopted.", "YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being equal and being fair.\n\nWhy would it be fair that you inherit 100% of your bio dad\u2019s inheritance (or any portion of it, I don\u2019t know if your bio dad has other kids) while your siblings receive nothing from that bio dad AND you receive an equal share to that of your siblings from their adoptive dad? That doesn\u2019t make sense and would be unfair. Let\u2019s just say bio dad and stepdad both have $100,000 to split up, for easy math. You expect to get $125,000 while your siblings get $25,000? Do you see how intensely unfair that would be? \n\nYou chose to maintain a relationship with your bio dad and not be adopted by your stepdad, which is totally fine, but expecting to receive all the exact same things that his legal children will is silly.", "He said it was divided equitably- not equally, and he is correct. \n\nIt\u2019s fair for him to give a larger portion to his legal children as you may also receive inheritance from your bio dad while they may not, they only have him. \n\nWhether you find it fair or just is another matter. But you\u2019re still getting an additional inheritance from your additional father - the others could also complain about that as theyre getting a smaller inheritance due to you being included despite not being their dads legal daughter.", "NTA. Are you guys all serious right now? This is the classic definition of playing favorites. She has a relationship with bio dad and doesn\u2019t have step dad adopt her. She loves him as a father, wether or not she wants to be adopted by him is her choice. Yes it is his choice for n what he does with his money, but come on he literally says he has an obligation to take care of his children legally and financially. When you marry someone with kids you are not supposed to marry play favorites, love equally. It\u2019s both their choices to feel that way but shame on all of you for saying she is entitled when she is hurt that someone who claims they love you really doesn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t want to be adopted. Everyone has a choice and an opinion.", "NTA. When he came into your mom's life and agreed to love and care for all of you, he cared and provided equally. It should be the same in his will. Otherwise, his legacy will be hurt feelings. He and tour mom should have thought that through,  and now they've made a mess.\nDo your mom and step-dad know if your dad has even named you in his will? Does he have a will? If he's remarried without a will, everything goes to his wife. Does he have other children?\nToo many variables here.\nBefore anyone judges, my husband and I have a blended family and we are dividing our assets equally among bio and step children.

What are the options they get something from him too? Ultimately no one owes anything to anyone when they die.", "YTA\n\nHe\u2019s right. You still get your inheritance from your bio-dad, something the other kids won\u2019t have. \nAnd: he doesn\u2019t need to leave you anything legally. So be happy he\u2019s still around and you can have a nice vacation in his memory when he\u2019s gone.", "YTA but gently because I know this probably feels personal when really it\u2019s likely more about the fact that your siblings can\u2019t legally inherit from your bio dad and you can because of the adoptions, so Jimmy feels like he should fully provide for them because they have no other dad to inherit from. You remain your bio dad\u2019s next of kin and will likely inherit from him when he passes too when your siblings will not unless your dad explicitly provides for them by name in a will, which seems unlikely given the strained nature of their relationship. Jimmy\u2019s thinking is you have 2 dads to support you whereas your siblings only have him now.", "He's correct. You're not legally his daughter despite how you feel towards him plus by law you are a legal heir to your mother and father's estates. He's left you 10% of estate. That's fair for someone who is not his legal child. It shows he cares but isn't big enough for your siblings to want to go to court and challenge. At least I hope they wouldn't but people do fight over money after a loved one dies. YTA.", "YTA. Strictly speaking, Jim doesn't have to do a thing. He could leave all his money to a donkey charity.  Your step-dad including you, his step-daughter, in his will, when he has three legal children is great. \n\nYou chose to keep him as step-dad and maintain a link with your bio dad, so you have two fathers, maybe two inheritances, and of course, you work and make your living.  What more can you want? \n\nFeel your feelings, process them thoroughly. Then go apologise to your step-dad and have a good life.", "Yta, you are still getting an inheritance.It\u2019s his decision on how he is going to divide it.\n\nHe gave you his reasoning you can accept it or not.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the money but it is about the money.", "NAH. Firstly, this is his money to do with as he pleases, not yours to micromanage. Secondly, there are NO '*responsibilities*' to 'take care of' ADULT children - that's a made up concept within your stepdad's own thinking, he doesn't HAVE to give anything to any of you, he can spend it all or give it to charity. Thirdly, your step dad has ZERO control over your bio dad, and cannot guarantee that there is ANY money coming from that person - again anyone can do anything with their money - they don't always have money to leave or leave it to their children.  Lastly, it sounds like you think money is love and you feel somehow less loved because of his percentages? Or you're just in it for his money?  Let go of your inner greed and you will be fine.", "Why is it people think they are entitled to any amount of inheritance? If someone chooses to leave you something after they pass, it is a gift.\n\neven if it was OP's bio dad, she still would not have a right to complain about getting something for free\n\nYTA", "Probably because she has shown him she values him less than all the other siblings do. She honestly doesn't deserve what she's getting.", "I disagree, just OP is the asshole in this situation. She didn't want him to be her father, that's fine. He wants to leave his inheritance to his children, which OP is not one of. And that's fine too.

It\u2019s the stepdads every right but seriously how can you not see what he said was a dig to her. It\u2019s like a punishment bc she didn\u2019t get adopted. Like I said he has a right to do what he pleases but she is also allowed to be hurt by his words bc he feels more of a responsibility to the other siblings and not her.
