It stands to reason that your bio dad will be leaving you something that your siblings will not be getting....", "YTA\n\nYou simply can't have it both ways. You chose to forgive your bio dad and have him in your life. He is legally and morally your dad. Your step dad has accepted this, sounds like, well. He hasn't pushed more of an relationship on you than you have wanted. But then, you cannot pick and chose when he is your dad and should treat you like his legal child, when you didn't want that. Because what you're now seeing from his will and inheritance divide is how you have built your relationship from his POV. He's been your stepdad, stepping up once I  a while like a father, when you needed and allowed it. This is how it looks from inheritance POV. \n\nYour stepdad isn't being petty or punishing you, he's simply following the parental limitations and role you've wanted with him.", "I\u2019ll go against the grain on this a little. \n\nEquitably doesn\u2019t mean 30-30-30-10, and also just because he adopted the other children doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t adults.

He is being petty over you not choosing to be legally adopted by him, which shouldn\u2019t matter because a piece of paper doesn\u2019t define a relationship. I would decline his inheritance all together.", "It is understandable that you would be upset about the distribution of your stepdad's inheritance, as you have a close relationship with him and consider him to be a father figure in your life. However, it is also important to understand that your stepdad has a legal and parental relationship with your siblings and therefore may feel a stronger sense of responsibility to provide for them in the event of his passing.\r  \n\r  \nIt is also important to remember that inheritance is ultimately a personal decision and your stepdad has the right to distribute his assets as he sees fit. While it may be disappointing for you, it is ultimately his decision to make.\r  \n\r  \nIt sounds like your stepdad and you both have valid perspectives and feelings on the matter, and it may be helpful to have a calm and respectful conversation with him to express your thoughts and feelings on the matter, and to hear his reasoning.

This hits me right in the feels. \nOn my fathers side, I\u2019m getting snubbed of my entire inheritance bc my mother\u2019s family has stuff to give me and my half sister does not, so she\u2019s inheriting everything he has, my brother and I get nothing. Not extremely pleasant. My maternal grandmother is in a tough place, I have an adoptive cousin on that side who has 3 parents and he\u2019s inheriting from all of them (he will inherit more than everyone). Two substantial things were taken from my mother (and by extension me) by my grandmother to give to him just to make him feel more included. This is extremely tough to navigate. Do I feel shafted? Kind of. But I don\u2019t feel like I can or should be able to complain. Try to be kind and understanding. You\u2019re entitled to feel shitty over this.

You made a choice not to be adopted, he made a choice to prioritize his legal children over his stepchild. That is how choices work.", "I take back my YTA. You actually sound like a nice, reasonable person. Perhaps your stepdad took what you said the same way I did. It sounds like Ally definitely took it that way.\n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly now, you weren't upset because you were getting less money, but because it made feel like you're less of a daughter to him than your siblings?", "Why is it fair for her to rank step-dad as not her father, but not for him to do the same? OP can feel however she feels, but actively complaining about it when she has made her own choice makes her an asshole", "Perhaps Jimmy also sees you as less of a daughter than the siblings that chose to be adopted.", "YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between being equal and being fair.\n\nWhy would it be fair that you inherit 100% of your bio dad\u2019s inheritance (or any portion of it, I don\u2019t know if your bio dad has other kids) while your siblings receive nothing from that bio dad AND you receive an equal share to that of your siblings from their adoptive dad? That doesn\u2019t make sense and would be unfair. Let\u2019s just say bio dad and stepdad both have $100,000 to split up, for easy math. You expect to get $125,000 while your siblings get $25,000? Do you see how intensely unfair that would be? \n\nYou chose to maintain a relationship with your bio dad and not be adopted by your stepdad, which is totally fine, but expecting to receive all the exact same things that his legal children will is silly.", "He said it was divided equitably- not equally, and he is correct. \n\nIt\u2019s fair for him to give a larger portion to his legal children as you may also receive inheritance from your bio dad while they may not, they only have him. \n\nWhether you find it fair or just is another matter. But you\u2019re still getting an additional inheritance from your additional father - the others could also complain about that as theyre getting a smaller inheritance due to you being included despite not being their dads legal daughter.", "NTA. Are you guys all serious right now? This is the classic definition of playing favorites. She has a relationship with bio dad and doesn\u2019t have step dad adopt her. She loves him as a father, wether or not she wants to be adopted by him is her choice. Yes it is his choice for n what he does with his money, but come on he literally says he has an obligation to take care of his children legally and financially. When you marry someone with kids you are not supposed to marry play favorites, love equally. It\u2019s both their choices to feel that way but shame on all of you for saying she is entitled when she is hurt that someone who claims they love you really doesn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t want to be adopted.

You remain your bio dad\u2019s next of kin and will likely inherit from him when he passes too when your siblings will not unless your dad explicitly provides for them by name in a will, which seems unlikely given the strained nature of their relationship.

You're not legally his daughter despite how you feel towards him plus by law you are a legal heir to your mother and father's estates. He's left you 10% of estate.

Firstly, this is his money to do with as he pleases, not yours to micromanage. Secondly, there are NO '*responsibilities*' to 'take care of' ADULT children - that's a made up concept within your stepdad's own thinking, he doesn't HAVE to give anything to any of you, he can spend it all or give it to charity. Thirdly, your step dad has ZERO control over your bio dad, and cannot guarantee that there is ANY money coming from that person - again anyone can do anything with their money - they don't always have money to leave or leave it to their children.

Idk I'll give the step dad a benefit of the doubt over OP and bio dad", "Apparently Unpopular but I kind do think NAH\n\nJimmy\u2019s logic isn\u2019t crazy so I get where he is coming from.\n\nBut from your comment, your siblings and you have the same bio dad, you\u2019re just the only one he decided to keep a relationship with him?\n\nHe is really a father to all of you, and no one will know what your bio father will do in his will. He could still include the children he\u2019s NC with or give it all to you.\n\nAt the end of the day you are not entitled to either man\u2019s inheritance, but I understand your feelings", "YTA and it is about the money.", "YTA and entitled like no other", "YTA He told you that because you would inherit from your bio dad, and they would not. He is doing this to make it fair. Why should you inherit from two Dads while the others only inherit from one? You are being greedy.", "YTA\n\nYou're just being greedy.\n\nOf course you're being a huge AH.", "NAH.\n\nJimmy's trying to look out fairly for everyone, but his estate planning is based on a very big assumption about what your biodad's going to do.\n\nMeanwhile, you're now feeling like the odd man out in a not-so-blended family, and because it came up in terms of money, it's hard to talk it out or explain it without sounding like it's all about the money.", "NAH\n\nI don't think bio dad is relevent. You though you had a dad/daughter relation with Jimmy. He just told you you were wrong.", "NTA, he claims to see you as a daughter but you realize he doesn\u2019t. I understand why that hurts.", "YATA", "I can't even wrap my head around this. When my dad got older (mom was already gone) my siblings and I actively encouraged him to spend every dime he had. We didn't need or want his money. We'd rather every dollar give us another day with him.\n\nI just don't get people thinking they \"deserve\" anything from their dead relatives.", "I think you should apologize. You can't have things both ways. It comes off as greedy and ungrateful. YTA", "YTA. It\u2019s his money to do with how he wants. Honestly you are lucky he is giving you anything.", "YTA - you're not entitled to anything, also, look up the difference between equitable and equal.", "Yta, inheritance makes people act ugly, you're not entitled to anything. \n\nIf you really appreciate him, enjoy his company whilst he's still alive, stop making plans for his possessions when he's gone, and especially stop making him feel guilty for doing what he thinks is right, you don't dictate that.", "NTA he cant say an equal share then not make it equal ur right he is doing this to punish u but that's easily fixed hold him back at arm length he's not Ur father figure he's just Ur mother's husband", "I\u2019d say NTA\n\nThis is specifically because he literally lied to you when he said it was divided equally. It\u2019s honestly a slap in the face. He might at well leave you off of it altogether if he\u2019s gonna give you less cause you didn\u2019t ask him to adopt you.", "YTA\n\nEquitable does not mean equal. You have the support of an additional parent; they do not. He is trying to ensure they are taken care of when he dies, but that you aren't left out.\n\nYou're being greedy and ungrateful demanding a bigger slice of his pie when you have another pie altogether.", "NTA. He's treating you differently because you're not legally his.", "True, I believe that step-dad is punishing her because she didn't allow him to adopt her, but now his feelings are hurt by what she said. Oh well....", "I mean, look\u2026 since your step dad has decided that you only get 10% from him when he goes because asking his \u201creal\u201d kids to give up 5% each so no one feels slighted because you\u2019re getting an inheritance from your biological father, make sure bio dad knows this and leaves 100% to you. Don\u2019t let yourself get shafted twice because bio dad decides to do the right thing by his estranged kids.", "If there\u2019s no will, are the siblings that were adopted by stepdad able to inherit from bio dad?", "That\u2019s a legal question I\u2019m sure I cannot answer.  It may be different in different states (or countries). I find people with no will generally don\u2019t leave much though.  I would imagine they waited until they were 18 so they didn\u2019t need to get the fathers permission\u2026 so I don\u2019t know if he renounced them.  And I don\u2019t know if that matters.", "> She said she'd be surprised \n\nShe'd be surprised because she most likely doesn't *believe* her dad would leave them anything. Nowhere does she state she's actually discussed it with him, so it's belief, not *knowledge.* Of course, she has an *idea* about it, but she also had the *idea* that her Stepdad held her completely equal to her bio-sibs. So, while I agree that stepdad has every right to portion it how he did, and **he is NTA for** ***that*** **part** at all and I even think it makes plenty of sense even though his argument is based on assumptions. I think she's NTA for having an emotional reaction. It's where she goes from there that could *easily* make her an AH. And of course her sibs think she's the AH, they're getting full shares and they hate their bio-dad. \n\nA lot of it all comes down to details which we **don't have** as to exactly how heinous their father was and how much of an AH OP is for staying in contact because she didn't have the same issues. Was it physical abuse, bigotry, religious issues or was he violently against their future life/career plans? \\*Shrug\\* no info on that other than her sibs do not *seem* to be NC with OP over her not cutting their bio-dad out.\n\nSo based on what we DO have, I say NTA. But yeah, this is one that could tilt to a Y T A with the slightest expansion.", "> Of course, she has an idea about it, but she also had the idea that her Stepdad held her completely equal to her bio-sibs.\n\n\nWhy?  She chose not to be adopted by step-dad.  She\u2019s the one who decided to be different.  She should have known that decision would have consequences.  Here they are.  You\u2019re bending over backwards to defend OP when she\u2019s the one who created this situation.\n\nOP wants full inheritance from step-dad?  OP should have fully committed to step-dad the way her siblings did.", "Not even close. She said her bio dad was not a good husband to her mom. Can mean anything sure. Maybe he was just abusive. Maybe he didn't put the toilet seat down. But that's not the question. She asked if she's the AH for calling her stepdad petty and unfairly punishing her for not wanting to or asking to be adopted because this way she gets 10% of the money while sibs get 30% each. \nSo yeah she's the AH. She's not entitled to any of it. Tbh nobody is. Stepdad's money so he decided who gets how much. Is he wrong to assume she'll get shit from her bio dad? No. She's assuming she'll get it all as well. So does she deserve the same estate as her siblings? Maybe. Step dad decides. But is she the AH for calling her step dad petty? Yup. Big time", ">You\u2019re bending over backwards to defend OP when she\u2019s the one who created this situation.\n\nI'm defending my argument against someone who states my wording of it has no standing. I stand behind my original statement pending any other expansion by OP. Of course I'm going to argue with someone who says *my* statement is invalid just because *they* believe I should infer the **exact same meaning** from words that they hold. It more of a semantical argument then me defending OP. This is Aita, every judgement is based on assumptions, I'm just pointing out that yelling Y T A at the OP about making assumptions when absolutely everyone is basing their stance on assumptions is not exactly fair while posting my take. Then someone comes along and states that my assumptions absolutely cannot be valid and only theirs counts. So, I'm not bending over backwards for OP, I'm fencing for my own behalf, thank you very much.", "YTA other than feeling hurt did you understand his explanation of why he did it? It isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t love you it\u2019s that you have an additional inheritance stream. He is making it equal for all his kids. He didn\u2019t cut you out. You need to get over the number. You have to think of your siblings and put them into the equation. I think your step dad did the right thing.", "Yta", "YTA - It never fails that people like you want the best of both worlds when it benefits you but not when it benefits others.   There's no reason why you can't talk to bio dad about getting life insurance for both of you.   He's not punishing you, he's trying to make sure the children with only one opportunity inherent get enough while those of you who get both opportunities are still cared for.    Bet you don't plan on giving your sibs any of bio dad's money if he has any.  The only one here petty is you.   Please tell him your sorry", "YTA he\u2019s 100% right they only have what your mom and him leave, you have a bio dad still. You could have had the same amount if you let him adopt you but that was up to you. I think his plan is 100% fair. I would never expect a step parent to leave me as much money as their bio kid, as I\u2019m not their child.", "YTA - you made your choice and he respected that. Why can\u2019t you do the same?", "Yeah you\u2019re so right! An inheritance might not even exist and why should it \n\nPeople get so weird and entitled about inheritance \u2026 like would you not just give it all back for and extra week with your loved one?", "Are you going to share it with them regardless? No? Then be happy with 10%. You don't even deserve that, FFS.", "You guys are getting inheritances?\n\nLike is this such a common thing to get one?", "Nah man, I'm being genuine. I'm the one who always forgives and tries to heal rifts in my family, so I sorta get where OP is coming from..", "Sometimes people do not need to be forgiven or healed or whatever. OP needs to hear she's fucking up."]}
