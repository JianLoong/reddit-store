The venue, decorator, caterer, bakery, photographer, florist, and entertainment have been booked and all\u2019s been paid for either in full or have deposits made. \n\nThe issue comes with the bar. They want a completely open bar wedding reception with no limit. My husband and I both immediately said \u201cAbsolutely not. No. \u201c this is the only thing we told her no to.

You and your husband are not only paying for the weeding, you also are letting them make the decisions. You gave a clear boundary, and even offered a budget you would be happy to cover, with the bride and groom being responsible for whatever was left. That is more than fair. Sounds like they are young and they are used to having their way and they are just waiting for you to cave in. They should be thanking you both for your generosity and bending over backwards to make sure that your condition was met.", "NTA. Your paying for it. You have the right to decide how much you are willing to pay and can afford. Alcohol is expensive and an unlimited open bar could add up very fast.

If I were you I wouldn't be paying for the bar tab at all for the way they're acting, and let them pay for it!", "NTA, your daughter seems very entitled but the thing that got me was the fianc\u00e9 reaction. How DARE he call you an AH for telling him how you will spend YOUR money, this interactionwould have changedmy whole opinionof this boy.

As BB King said, you\u2019re \u201cpaying the cost to be the boss\u201d.

That's a reception I would not attend, personally.", "NTA an open bar for a bunch of college aged kids at a wedding sounds like a recipe for disaster they would definetly take it as an opportunity to get absolutely hammered on your dime.", "I can't imagine being so entitled to demand someone else pay for an open bar at a wedding after they've shelled out the cost for almost everything else. \n\nIf your daughter feels all strongly about it, she can request a second contact to pay anything above your original contract with the venue and take it out of her honeymoon money. And when she can't go on a honeymoon because all their 21yo friends took advantage of the bar, she'd cry about how unfair it is and why did they drink so much, and she'd learn the harsh lesson of why you don't have open bars. \n\nNTA", "NTA and people who use weddings to get shitfaced drunk are assholes.

One of the signature cocktails had dry ice for the effect but that was only during cocktail hour. After that it was regular ice. That cocktail was vodka based and sweet, the other was a whiskey based old-fashioned type of cocktail, so very strong. There was white and red wine and a couple beer options. More than enough choices for everyone to have something they liked, and stayed well within the budget.

I think everyone's personal opinion of open bar isn't relevant.\n\nThe fact is, whether the daughter was demanding open bar, a photobooth or an ice sculpture, anything extra that is out of budget, OP can veto. Because OP is paying and the expectation should be that if a parent offers to pay for a wedding, yeah, they'd be AH for suddenly dropping out of normal/basic wedding needs (suddenly saying no to the cake after the expectation was set that they'd pay). But for the most part, so long as no one made promises to pay for whatever the daughter and her fiance dreamed of, OP isn't the AH for saying no to an extra wedding luxury that is out of budget. No matter what it is.", "My husband is far more pissed off about the FSIL\u2019s disrespect towards me than I am. I was annoyed and even a bit angry at first. On one hand, I acknowledge I jumped the gun a little to call the venue the next day. It was partially reacting out of emotion from being called an AH. On the other hand, I was doing what I needed to do to protect myself financially. They refused to negotiate and accept reasonable accommodations. So I did what I had to do to stay within my budget while ensuring they had an adequate selection of drinks supplied all night long so guests would not have to pay. \n\nMy husband is pretty protective of me and the family, so he\u2019s pretty angry with the FSIL\u2019s disrespect. He\u2019s been sitting on his sore spot too. I\u2019m mostly over it. I don\u2019t want to dwell on it. I just want to get everything settled and keep everybody happy and celebrate a happy Union.", "We\u2019ve been told Thank you, repeatedly. \u263a\ufe0f \n\nThis is truly baffling and appalling. My daughter is a very good person. She\u2019s usually very courteous and humble. They both have been very appreciative and grateful and have said as much many times throughout the wedding planning. Every time I pay something or officially sign a contract they thank me and tell us they are grateful. He\u2019s also always been a good guy. Respectful, kind, courteous. \n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve had to say no, and haven\u2019t tried controlling the planning, and the first time they\u2019ve tried going over budget and being so rude and entitled and disrespectful about it. \n\nSo, I truly have no idea why now. Wedding jitters? Stress? I don\u2019t know.. but thank you for thanking me.", "As I mentioned in other posts. This is extremely out of character for my daughter. She\u2019s usually very humble. And she\u2019s a good person. As for my FSIL he\u2019s been very polite and easy going and laid back for the 4 years I\u2019ve known him.  We\u2019re very close with them. They spend a lot of time with us. At least 3 nights a week we get together for dinner at either house, we alternate. And we are often out going and doing fun things together as well at least a few times a month.  Many weekend nights we have a family game night so all the kids can participate and just enjoy having them around. \n\nThis is the first time he\u2019s been so rude.  \nThey both have, up until this incident, been very appreciative and grateful for the gift and the help we\u2019ve given them.   They\u2019ve thanked us Every time I paid a deposit or signed a contract. They\u2019ve been very respectful up until now. \n\nThis is the first time in the wedding process that we\u2019ve had to tell them no. But it\u2019s also the first time they\u2019ve tried to go over my budget. \n\nI\u2019m honestly baffled and appalled by how they reacted because it is completely out of character for both of them. All I can think of is stress of the wedding planning and nerves from the approaching date is causing them to become a bridezilla or a groomzilla? I don\u2019t know. \n\nThey both have college degrees and work full time. He makes a decent wage, but she makes more and is doing well for herself. They\u2019ve been using their money for their own bills and to save for a down payment on a house and for their honeymoon fund. They\u2019re responsible and are financially independent. I don\u2019t support them and they don\u2019t need me to.", "if she's been reading wedding blogs, TONS of them go off on anything less than a fully open bar as tacky and cheap. cash bars, drink tickets, semi open etc. are all really vilified in that arena. so if she's feeling pressured somewhere else - i.e. trying to look good for the inlaws or such- this might be getting amplified to a degree it normally wouldn't.", "I\u2019m doing an open bar for my wedding, but it\u2019s 30 people and we\u2019re in our 30s and can pay for it all ourselves. I\u2019m still limiting which cocktails are offered and a pre-purchasing wine so once it\u2019s out it\u2019s out. \n\nA friend\u2019s wedding (they were in their 40s) did drink tickets for the bar. Every guest got 2 tickets and they ID\u2019d at the bar. Anything non-alcoholic was unlimited, and you could offer the champagne toast glass free if you wanted to go that similar route! \n\nOpen bar weddings are either convenient or a sh*t show. Last one I went to was messy af and everyone was over 30. A bunch of 21/22 year olds would be\u2026sloppy. \ud83e\udee0", "This is the way.\n\nDaughter wants to F around? Then she's going to find out. I bet her tune changes really fast after that.", "My dad bought me a Walmart cake and got my wife and I an engraved serving set probably less than $100 total. Mom picked up our tab at the little shop where we had our wedding and took the kids to a movie for our 3 hour honeymoon. \n\nSome kids are so fucking entitled.", "Well may I suggest that you give them the budget for the entire wedding and if they want to redistribute money from somewhere else they can do so - they may have to cut down on the food and flowers as well as losing out on some of the deposits paid. \n\nTime for them to be adults, budget and prioritise. \n\nIf the open bar is so important to them they should take it out of their honeymoon budget. Up to them if a nice honeymoon or an open bar is more important to them. \n\nThey both work full time and many people have to save up and pay for their own wedding. OP has been extremely generous to pay so much already. To then get insulted is really rude and entitled. OP keeps apologising for the kids appalling behaviour and keeps saying she\u2019s a good kid normally. I suspect this apologist attitude probably enabled the daughter to act entitled. \n\nAnyway, my $0.002", "As someone who's parents paid for the majority of my wedding, your daughter is a spoiled brat. If there was a single thing my parents didn't want to pay for that I wanted, I gave zero attitude about it and paid myself.\n\nTo avoid any of those situations in the first place, if I knew my parents wouldn't be thrilled about a new bill to add, I would just pay myself without asking them because I was already so grateful for the help I was getting. Your daughter and her fianc\u00e9 are entirely entitled and their behavior is appalling", "Agreed. We had an open bar for our wedding and tbh I would have felt kind of cheap if my guests had to pay for their own drinks. I think OP is totally NTA but I don\u2019t get the anti-open bar judgement in these comments. Then again, our guests were all in their 30s and above.", "Same here - my wedding and 95% of the weddings I've attended have been open bar. No one got sloshed, no one made a fool of themselves, there weren't lines at the bar all night. People had a couple of drinks, some champagne for the toast and that was that.\n\nAs far as the cost, it was usually a per head cost for the open bar, not a per drink cost. It wasn't unreasonably expensive.", "> . In my country, almost every wedding is open bar and this doesn't happen?\n\nI'm American and this is my experience as well...", "Unfortunately, I have a feeling that \u201ckeeping everyone happy\u201d is a reason why your daughter thinks she can act this way in the first place. If it truly is your SIL behind this then she should be calling him out and shutting him down. \n\nHonestly I think the best use of any money right now is putting those kids into a pre marital counseling course with a qualified professional. Their age and how this is being handled by them is worrisome for their future.", "I get you want everyone to be happy, however I think the minimum requirement for everyone to get back on good terms is that your daughter and future SIL sincerely apologize for their behavior.\n\nCalling your future in-laws names is honestly not adult or acceptable behavior in a healthy and loving family. You skip the apology on this, what is he going to do next? Call you names again the first time you turn down paying for them to go on vacation, finance their home, cannot babysitter for them? Is that the dynamic you want to accept going forward? \n\nYou should think long and hard if you still want to finance their wedding at all if that is how they intend to reward you doing them a favor going forward.", "It\u2019s probably because this is the first time they haven\u2019t got their way on something.", "God this makes me so mad the way your son in law treated you. My wife and I eloped because there was no way I was going to allow my in-laws to pay for our wedding. To have you so graciously pay for everything and then insult you like that for some stupid drunk fest after party is just a terrible way to start a lifetime relationship with his new family. I hope he has some good friends that will slap some sense into him.", "I think that might depend on the area. Where I live (metro NYC), cash bars are considered really, really tacky. Most people opt for open bar or just beer/wine that they pay for.", "I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this advice! It's what I thought immediately. If they have stopped talking to you over this, you would be fully in your rights to tell them you want them to have the wedding they truly want, so you'll not be paying for any of it. Your gift to them is the freedom to host the wedding of their dreams. What a ridiculous hill for your daughter to die on! Let her.

Both he and my daughter have been saving their money for a down payment on a house and for the honeymoon fund.", "I feel like younger people in certain situations can absolutely go overboard. But on a wedding? With your family all around? No, that is not the moment you choose to get super drunk. You get drunk around your friends, in a night out where you go in already with the idea that maybe you will end up drunk. Weddings are the place to just drink a bit, get a happy buzz going and dance and have fun with your family and friends.\n\nFor some context, I'm 23 (in my country drinking age is 18, not 21), so definitely on the younger side.", "Yep, where I live (outside NYC), cash bars are considered VERY VERY tacky. When you have a wedding reception, guests should not have to take out their wallets - bar, coat check, etc. are all paid for by the hosts.", ">They want us to pay for the entire bar bill and keep it open and unlimited.\n\nINFO:  Is this because they heard somewhere (social media, tik tok, etc) that weddings are \"supposed to\" have open bars, otherwise your a loser or something?  Could that be your motivation?  \n\nI'm around your age OP, and I read this as someone/social media told your daughter and her fiance that this is the \"way it should be\" and they just believe it.", "Ah. Time for them to decide on a wedding and a honeymoon or a wedding and a house. To expect to start their lives with a fully paid wedding, a nice honeymoon  and a new house? In their early 20's?\n\nThis is so outside the norm for more folks their age or even their generation, that I doubt they understand just how lucky they really are. My husband and I were each working multiple jobs in the 2 years leading up to our wedding just to pay for a small ceremony with lots of talented friends and family lending their skills, but very little financial help. \n\nThey need to learn to prioritize their expenses for wants.\n\nAnd they need to learn not to bite the hand that feeds them.
