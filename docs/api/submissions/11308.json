As a part of this study, her and my parents traveled to DC 3 times over the course of a year. The first time, I couldn't go with because my parents couldn't afford to buy me a ticket on top of what the study was funding. They found out when they were there that they would have totally funded my ticket, so when the second trip was lining up with the week of my 16th birthday, I was super excited because I thought I could finally see DC. I wasn't able to afford my school's 8th grade trip, so the idea of a sweet 16 in DC was the best thing in the world to me, especially as a kid who was really interested in politics. \n\nMy parents didn't allow me to go on this trip because the week we would have been there would have conflicted with my first day of school--I have an early September birthday. I was completely devastated, because not only were my DC dreams crushed, but I was also going to be alone for my 16th birthday. My best friend's parents ended up letting me stay with them for the week so that we could do something special for my birthday. I don't even remember why I couldn't go on the 3rd trip. Probably something to do with school as well. They had a lot of time to sight-see and have fun, and it was a bummer to miss out on that with my family. \n\nI'm now 30 and am about to see DC for the first time as I'm interviewing for a job. It's the ideal job because it's half remote and half on-site, and I'd be able to split my time between DC and NYC. My interview is on Tuesday, but I'm flying in tomorrow to have some extra days to really see everything I want to see, and also to just give myself time to relax before a high stakes interview. I'm funding this extra trip with some inheritance money I received late last year. \n\nWhen my parents found out about this trip, they asked if I could use some of that inheritance to fly them out so we could finally do a family trip together. They said they could show me some of the places they know and what became their favorite parts of DC on their trips. While I do have enough money to cover it, I don't particularly want to. I want this to be my own special trip where I'm doing what I want to do and seeing what I want to see. I also want the time that weekend to relax, and not have to go on a tour of all the places my family went to without me. I understand it's petty and that it's been a long time since all of that, but it still sort of hurts to think about even though it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things. I told them no, and they are making it out to seem like I'm rejecting them and acting in revenge for the past trips. Which is actually not true, it has way more to do with the stress of the interview and wanting to protect my peace than it does for any idea of revenge. \n\nI feel fine in my decision, but my family called me a spiteful asshole. So I'm asking here as a reality check for myself.", "created_utc": 1677776331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g7r2b/aita_for_refusing_to_include_my_family_on_a_trip/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's so weird.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm mostly going to be busy with my interview and won't have enough time to visit with you.  But if I did have time for a family vacation, I would need you to pay for your own expenses.  I need my inheritance money for my own needs.\"", "NTA, tell them straight that you are being petty. So what?", "NTA. That\u2019s so bizarrely selfish of your parents. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you pay out of your own money to have us infringe on your important interview trip after we refused three times to bring you on the same trip with us at no cost.\u201d\n\nIs your sister the golden child? Are they the type that doesn\u2019t like you to succeed more than your sister? There\u2019s something really off with their thought process here.", "wait... INFO: They got the chance to go to DC for a medical study for your sister's disability, right? Like to have your family go to DC so your sister can get the treatment she needed for her disability, or was it like a gift they gave your family for contributing to the study?", "NTA", "Jumping on the top comment to tell OP to definitely go to Baked and Wired for the best cupcakes!  Good luck in the interview!", "I don't even think it's petty- this is OP's money, and they're already splurging on a vacation for themselves.", "NTA-I would just say that you are saving your inheritance money to help you get settled if you get your new job. If they really wanted to make this a family trip, then they can pony up the money!", "You mean thrice.", "I did this a couple of times with my oldest son. Students were forbidden to be out of school when not on break. \n\nIt was a family trip to Italy over thanksgiving and he would miss 2.5 days of whatever.\n\nI wrote a polite letter to the school. Due to work schedules out family could not find another opportunity like this for the cultural education of a lifetime. Zero blowback on that \u2026", "OP is a brat for not funding her parents' 4th trip to DC so they can walk down memory lane?  Wtf?", "Disabled child in our home.  The parents are TA.  a 30 year old going for a job interview should be going alone, as there is enough pressure. This is something I would not do to my children, ever.  Edit: NTA for OP being excluded at appointments, but expecting to go on the trip when it's basically for work.", "Um no? Did you\u2026 not read? \n\nHer parents are absolutely out of line for expecting her to pay for them - or expecting to tag along at all. She is TAH for treating these medical trips like some luxurious vacation she missed out on. Her parents took her disabled sister to lengthy, exhausting appointments. Just because they found time to sightsee around DC doesn\u2019t mean they maliciously excluded OP. This wasn\u2019t exactly a family vacation in its original intent.", "NTA because your parents aren't entitled to their daughter's trip.\n\nIf you were petty like me, I'd ask my parents for their site seeing list. As I travel alone, I scratch each one off my list as I post it online followed by the caption...\"I finally get to see what my parents left me behind for the 1st, 2nd & 3rd time.\"\n\nThe less petty side of me would say, in my most cheerful voice \"mom & dad, you've been there 3 times already so you'll spoil the trip for me. I want to be surprised just like you were the 1st, 2nd & 3rd time. You can invite me next time...when you plan your 4th trip.", "NTA, regardless of what happened in the past. You have an interview to focus on, and things you want to do on your own schedule. Solo traveling is awesome, and do not apologize for it! You don\u2019t have to justify anything, and frankly I think your parents are rude to ask you to fund their trip, and even more rude for being upset when you said no. Who does that? Entitled people.", "NTA. Honestly I don't even think it's petty either. It's your money they're asking you to use, and it's right before an important interview. A solo trip is completely understandable and would be expected if it was any other location. Enjoy your trip, let yourself relax and have fun, and kick ass at that interview.", "NTA. Don't pay just to be stressed out before a big interview.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter why you don't want them to join you. It's your money and you've no obligation to spend any of it on them. You've no obligation to spend time with them simply because they want to join you.\n\n\"No\" can be a complete sentence.", "Why would a 30 year old need their parents to tag along on a job interview? That's the question to put to your parents. They had their fun and now it's your turn.\n\nOP, when you get to DC, map out the location of your interview and how to get there so that there will be no major mishaps on Tuesday. Once that is done, put on your sneakers and explore. DC is a walkable city but the Metro is easy to understand and get around on. There are only 5 or 6 lines which are referred to by colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Silver and Orange).  They also go to parts of Virginia and Maryland so if you want you can visit 2 additional states. The Metro system also has floor lights in the station that flicker when the train is coming into the station (that may not be as much fun for a 30 year old but it was exciting to younger me!)\n\nThe Smithsonian Museums are free and most are in the same area. Spend some time in one or two because you won't have time to see them all.  You should also try to check out some of the smaller museums like the National Postal Museum which was surprisingly interesting. Union Station (where the Amtrak trains come in) is a short distance from that Museum and you can grab some lunch there. There are some shopping malls to visit as well as the historic sites. I would recommend that you sign up for a hop on hop off trolley tour one evening so that you can get an idea of some of the sites that you might want to see on your next visit.\n\nIn short, you won't be able to do everything in one weekend ish trip but you will get a taste of Washington so that when you come back, you can just add to your memories. Your parents might be partially right, you don't want them to come after they denied you three times. But you are also an adult who can travel on her own and make her own memories. You should be able too show them YOUR favorite spots and places if you ever travel as a family. They had their chance, now it's your turn to explore.\n\nBest of luck, OP, with your interview. Do keep us posted so we can offer more suggestions about what to do in DC.", "Let\u2019s see. Back in the day the study organization would have paid for you to go, but your parents opted out even though they wouldn\u2019t have to pay. And now years later, you get to go, and they want to go too, AND have you pay for it?\nNTA. Have fun exploring the city. I\u2019ve always wanted to see DC. Maybe some day\u2026", "NTA. I would have told dad that hearing him call me that makes me wonder if I ever want to have any contact with him again and that I would need time to think bout going no contact with him for the rest of his life. Then tell him I'd get back to him and hang up. Then give him a few weeks to sweat it out. IF when you call he doesnt apologize.. Well snip snip.", "NTA. Why are they expecting you to fund the trip? Who did the inheritance come from?\n\nI hope you have a blast in DC. It's really okay for it to be a solo trip.", "op=NTA\n\nIf they truly wanted to join you, it should be at their expense, there is no reason you should waste your inheritance on their trip.\n\nHowever, I see that at this point in your life, you don't want to have them join you. \n\nI can see how this would go, you bring your parents(/sister?) and they keep talking about their previous trips, all it will do is remind you of how you were excluded THOSE times.\n\nI had a sibling who liked to talk about how they had more fun with their friends at X, Y or Z.  It didn't exactly make me feel \"good\" about our \"sibling\" trip.  \n\nGood luck with your Interview(and your sightseeing)", "Actually, be a spiteful asshole. A free, fun trip is much more important that the first day of school!", "NTA. You reap what they sow and they made a point that you weren\u2019t important enough to be included THREE TIMES and now have the audacity to ask you to pay for them to come with to show off what they saw when they didn\u2019t invite you? Really?", "The reality is you wanted to go and missed out on three opportunities to go. Now that you have a legit reason to be there, I totally understand wanting to do your own thing. \n\nNTA - Also, I feel like it's insult to injury to demand that you fund their vacation.", "NTA.... Your money, your trip.  No one would blame you if you wanted to be a little petty or vengeful. They went 3 times without you, and 1 time was during your birthday.  They had nothing but lame excuses..  Go enjoy yourself.  Take a picture with a glass of wine in your hand, smiling with a caption like \" finally made it to DC after all this time, here's to my parents and my sister\".", "NTA \n\nYour family will get over it how omyou had to the last 3 times !", "NTA...   \n\n\nAnd please make it a point to go to Busboys and Poets @ 14th and V to enjoy some DC Tap Water (I kid you not, that's what they call one of their signature drinks).    \n\n\nWelcome to a glimpse inside the beltway!", "nta, they want you to pay for a trip. If they wanna go so badly they can pay for themselves.", "NTA - they had their THREE trips. \n\nI'm so jealous of your all-alone trip!  I took one like that a few years ago and it was awesome!  Don't forget to visit the zoo! There are so many fabulous places to visit in DC - have a wonderful time!", "NTA protect your peace.", "NTA. They left you at home for your 16th birthday while they got to go to DC. It's not petty, it's justice. Go by yourself, do exactly what you want to do, and have a great time. Why should you spend your money on them, when they wouldn't even spend someone else's money on you? Next time they complain, tell them to think about what they are feeling and realize that they did this to you. THREE TIMES.", "NTA. I wouldn't even be trying to justify it. It was petty that they didn't take you on the trip. Schools will allow absences for an educational trip. SMH. If I had the opportunity for that trip to be paid for I would have absolutely taken my kids out of school for it!", "NTA.  It's not petty.  It's your trip that you're funding.  They will spend the trip reminiscing about past trips with your sister.  Bonus, they want you to pay for their trip.  Have fun going solo.  So many museums it's actually easier to do it alone.  They can fund their own guilt trip.", "NTA They'll just hijack your trip and you won't be happy. They had their experience w/o you and you can have your own personal experience. And to call you a spiteful asshole is so wrong. They became the spiteful assholes.", "NTA. They found their favorite spots without you. You want to find your favorite spots without them.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around, if they don\u2019t like it, they can fund a Time Machine and change how they left you out in the past.", "NTA - but your parents are. Like major AH to do what they did to you. They just don\u2019t like that you are now the one with the power doing to the same thing, but you have actual important reasons.", "NTA. Lived in DC for 30+ years. In addition to Metro and regular WMTA buses, check out the DC Circulator bus routes (one bus can take you further into Georgetown), and: (1) eat at one of Jose Andres/Think Food restaurants (Zaytinya and Jaleo are my favorites); (2) visit the Library of Congress Jefferson building for a great tour (the library building is beautiful and the library holds way more than just books).", "NTA and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s petty at all.

Now if they were paying for their ticket, then stay in the same hotel and catch up with them, when you wanted to.", "NTA!! I would hope their financial position has improved over the years.  If they want to reminisce so badly they can take their own trip (YET AGAIN)! Have a great time and good luck on the interview.", "NTA. Your parents are though.", "NTA; it\u2019s a free country they can visit DC on their own time and dime.", "Nta, and I fully support petty solo trips taken out of spite, even though that's *definitely* not what you're doing.

I went there back in 2005 and it was amazing lThe Library of Congress is truly spectacular.", "If they think you're doing it as revenge, that suggests that they now realize that revenge might be warranted.

What does that make you for abandoning me on my 16th birthday? You weren't good parents and you have to live with your failures.\"\n\nNTA", " NTA. Seems they are learning what it feels like to be left outside of fun activities. They\u2019re also parents they can fund their own trip. And even if you were being petty, that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t owe them anything, you worked hard to get where you are. \n\nI always say, treat people the way you want to be treated.", "NTA the fact that they're making it seem like you're doing it out of spite shows they know they were wrong. Enjoy your trip without them", "I think they\u2019re projecting how they themselves would act in OPs place. \n\nThey know they were nasty and unfair when OP was 16 so they expect OP to behave the same. \n\nOP, you are NTA. 100%. \n\nGo enjoy your trip to DC, and I hope you ace the interview too!!", "It\u2019s the stroll down memory lane aspect that bothers me the most.

Sounds like OP is going to be told what sights to see and what restaurants to visit, all while listening to reminiscences of the trips she was excluded from. NTA.", "The OP is called a glass child. It\u2019s the child they don\u2019t see because the other child is special needs. Glass children are often physically, emotionally, mentally, and MEDICALLY neglected because parents think about the disabled child first always.", "I was in these studies as a disabled kid and as an disabled adult and trust me- I\u2019d there was time to sight see and get so familiar they want to give OP a tour of their favorite spots then they had the downtime to form favorite spots \ud83d\ude44 these are glorified vacations as long as someone is not in enough pain or too sick to go out and about having a grand old time.", "I want to add in here a side trip to Annapolis for Blue Crabs if you can fit it in your schedule. Good Luck!", "Also hopping on to recommend Nino's Bakery for absolutely delicious croissants and pastries! \n\nI love DC! So many interesting and beautiful things to enjoy! I've been fortunate to visit several times.", "OP doesn't want them there - she has an upcoming interview & is using the days in advance to sightsee & chill, so she can power through and wow her interviewers.\n\nHaving parents who make selfish and nasty comments is the opposite of a fun and chill weekend.", "The first time, they couldn't pay for her and didn't know she could go and have all expenses paid. So I only included those they actively excluded her.", "They also went sight seeing. The medical appointments don\u2019t take that long.
