{"id": 11308, "submission_id": "11g7r2b", "title": "AITA for refusing to include my family on a trip?", "selftext": "When I was 15/16 my sister was invited to a medical study for a disability she has. As a part of this study, her and my parents traveled to DC 3 times over the course of a year. The first time, I couldn't go with because my parents couldn't afford to buy me a ticket on top of what the study was funding. They found out when they were there that they would have totally funded my ticket, so when the second trip was lining up with the week of my 16th birthday, I was super excited because I thought I could finally see DC. I wasn't able to afford my school's 8th grade trip, so the idea of a sweet 16 in DC was the best thing in the world to me, especially as a kid who was really interested in politics. \n\nMy parents didn't allow me to go on this trip because the week we would have been there would have conflicted with my first day of school--I have an early September birthday. I was completely devastated, because not only were my DC dreams crushed, but I was also going to be alone for my 16th birthday. My best friend's parents ended up letting me stay with them for the week so that we could do something special for my birthday. I don't even remember why I couldn't go on the 3rd trip. Probably something to do with school as well. They had a lot of time to sight-see and have fun, and it was a bummer to miss out on that with my family. \n\nI'm now 30 and am about to see DC for the first time as I'm interviewing for a job. It's the ideal job because it's half remote and half on-site, and I'd be able to split my time between DC and NYC. My interview is on Tuesday, but I'm flying in tomorrow to have some extra days to really see everything I want to see, and also to just give myself time to relax before a high stakes interview. I'm funding this extra trip with some inheritance money I received late last year. \n\nWhen my parents found out about this trip, they asked if I could use some of that inheritance to fly them out so we could finally do a family trip together. They said they could show me some of the places they know and what became their favorite parts of DC on their trips. While I do have enough money to cover it, I don't particularly want to. I want this to be my own special trip where I'm doing what I want to do and seeing what I want to see. I also want the time that weekend to relax, and not have to go on a tour of all the places my family went to without me. I understand it's petty and that it's been a long time since all of that, but it still sort of hurts to think about even though it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things. I told them no, and they are making it out to seem like I'm rejecting them and acting in revenge for the past trips. Which is actually not true, it has way more to do with the stress of the interview and wanting to protect my peace than it does for any idea of revenge. \n\nI feel fine in my decision, but my family called me a spiteful asshole. So I'm asking here as a reality check for myself.", "created_utc": 1677776331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g7r2b/aita_for_refusing_to_include_my_family_on_a_trip/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a grown up going to a job interview. Since its a place that has a lot of sights to see you are adding in a few additional days but basically you are going for a job interview.

They were okay leaving you behind when someone else would have funded your trip, why would you be the ah for not paying for them now?\n\nLuckily I think the weather is supposed to be okay in DC this weekend. My only advice would be to Google to make sure any sites you want to see are open. Sometimes one or two museums/monuments will be closed for renovations or other reasons.\n\nUnfortunately a little early for cherry blossoms but hey if you land the job you'll be able to see them eventually.\n\nPublic transit uses SmartTrip cards but I think you can load one through Apple/Google wallet.
