You're absolutely right. Sara is generous to you - her bio child. She has no obligation to give money to your dad's other kids and owes even less to Kayla. I would block Kayla and tell your dad pronto. Do not let Kayla continue to emotionally manipulate you and allow him to stay in the dark about this. \n\nQuite frankly, he shouldn't have allowed her to ignore you and treat you badly throughout your childhood either. He can at least step up now.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell you dad, but if you don\u2019t want to stress him out at the very least reduce/cut contact with Kayla. Do not ask Sara for money.", "NTA.  Since Kayla & your dad didn\u2019t foot any bills or co-sign any loans for your schooling, they should be ahead.  It\u2018s Kayla\u2019s and your dad\u2019s fault they didn\u2019t have the foresight to plan better.", "NTA. Your bio-mom should not be leaned on to pay for your half-siblings.\n\nEdited: And I\u2019ll just add that this isn\u2019t about caring about your half-siblings or not, and it\u2019s clearly not about jealousy. The hard truth for Kayla is that she never went out of her way to pay you much attention, and you grew up in the same house with her. Why should your bio-mom now be asked to do far more than was ever granted to you? Bio-mom doesn\u2019t owe anything here, and neither do you.", "Nta. She made clear since you were a child that you're not her daughter. Her kids, her business.", "So your step mom wants your bio mom to pay for step mom's kid?  LOLOLOLOL  Who in there right mind would ask such a thing.  Absolutely not - she can ask her herself if that's the route she wants to go.  Only asshole in this scenario is step mom Kayla - she seems to be the jealous one.  Shame on her for even trying to put you in that position. Your dad should absolutely know what is going on too!  Don't let her intrude on your relationship with Sara, it's non of her business what she does to help you, so keep it all to yourself moving forward!  Good luck!\n\nEdit:  I would also block this woman from calling/texting you!", "Also OP, you need to tell your father and grandparents asap.", "Why the repost?

If you ask for money (instead of her offering it like ahe did in the past)  you will likely ruin your relationship.

The reality is is that Your bio mom\u2019s money IS NOT yours. So how do they expect for you to just make decisions over it?
