Cutting someone off entirely because life happened *one time* and they had to cancel.... well, you *can* live your life like that if you choose, it's entirely up to you.

Yes, she should have notified you earlier but sometimes people have really hectic days.", "NTA.  She didn't respect your time.  That is a real turn-off.", "YTA. Things like that come up. I had to once reschedule my friend THREE times and I felt terrible about it. but I didn't want to break the law and isolation while I was ill with Covid or not go and see my nieces in Australia when it had been almost three years (twelve-year-old is now taller than me, which she wasn't at age nine and a half - her sister, age ten, is not too far behind). She was working last minute, it's not like she knew in advance. My friend had major patience with me, but being ill, then overseas was probably enough.

You are also kind of a dick.", "YTA \n\nAlso assuming you\u2019re a man, what exactly did you do to get ready? Shower and put on your least holy underwear. Big whoop.

Why did I have to text her first?", "I\u2019m aware that things come up. If she had texted me before saying that I would\u2019ve totally rescheduled. But no text at all?

I guess I\u2019m just hurt because I felt like me and her really connected and I was excited to see where it would go. I also make an effort to honor my time commitments and most of my friends are the same way.", "Well yeah, I mean you got offended and decided it meant a bunch of things. You can't actually know if it meant those things or if it was a one time accident.\n\nSo presuming you actually wanted to see her, who are you punishing here by your rigidity? Or are you just doing it to defend yourself against perceived rejection that you don't really have evidence for?\n\nI'm not sure why you're surprised that she's a bit cold with you now, you told her off pretty bluntly.\n\nI mean, not much you can do about it now unless you want to apologise and explain yourself, but maybe food for thought for next time.", "I agree, but sometimes time gets away from us. It feels like you're interpreting this as your date not being that important to her, and you may be right, but you may not be right.", "And you've never forgotten to do something when you're in a rush? I highly doubt that.", "Lol makes sense why you couldn\u2019t tell if she was into you romantically now.", "Yeah, I do feel like that. It\u2019s a bummer but I feel disrespected and no longer have the patience for things like that.", "Well, she\u2019s mentioned offhand that she dates women and knows I do too.", "I can completely understand that too. I hope you don't have to change restaurants now :-)", "Lmao ok you\u2019re just bad at social cues then", "Maybe but also I think it\u2019s hard to tell because it would be unprofessional for her to flirt with a customer with her manager and coworkers right there. She even glanced nervously at her manager next to us when she gave me her number. Also, with lesbians it can be hard to tell what\u2019s flirting and what\u2019s friendly."]}
