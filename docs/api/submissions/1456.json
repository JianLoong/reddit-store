Learn to chill and give people another chance before calling them disrespectful time wasters.\n\nHonestly if it was me, I wouldn't give you another chance. When your response to an honest mistake is for your temper to go from 0-100 in less than a second and cut contact, it's a red flag to me. I'd be to worried about your reaction to other out of my control things I can't text in advance of to want to risk another date.

I have heard every excuse in the book. The main thing I look for is a pattern. Sometimes shit happens and people need grace. I always assume positive intent the first time. \n\nIf it happens again or there is a pattern then I take action. Same for my personal life. You can\u2019t assume you know if she is a habitual flake or that she isn\u2019t into you. Assuming or expecting people to go by made up rules you have yet to establish is a great way to lose a good person. Not communicating your feelings is a good way to lose a good person. \n\nOnly way around this is to talk through it with her and go from there.

That\u2019s really not fair and is why you\u2019re being told you\u2019re too rigid.  Your text to her was saying you\u2019re not interested is probably being interpreted as curt borderline rude and why she responded in kind.  You can ask her if you can have a second chance but she\u2019s well within her rights to say no.", "She seems very invested in this and she was doing the majority of the planning.

It's happened to me before. I've had at least 3 guys start yelling at me in public, at parties or events with friends, saying I was being flirty with other people when I was supposed to like them. I didn't like any of these guys that way- had random conversations with all of them, though. They decided to make up relationships in their head and then play them out in real life except I had no idea. Some people don't think a man and a woman can just be friends. Imagine if this girl didn't know it was a first date and just thought she was grabbing diner with a potential friend. Should she have texted you? Yes. I work customer facing and yesterday my mom texted me at 8am. I didn't get a chance to see it till my shift was over around 4. Because  I was working. Not everyone has the luxury of having their phone out 24/7 at work. Especially servers, they don't even get breaks during their shifts. This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but you're just shooting yourself in the foot on this one. She informed you. Period. End of sentence.

I think ESH, she should have told you that she couldn\u2019t meet if you had firm plans. No one wants to be stood up in a bar / restaurant even if it is accidental. I don\u2019t think you managed your disappointment well", "The kicker for me is that if you hadn't texted her an hour before the date would she have let you know they couldn't make it? If their excuse was that they were busy all day and forgot I doubt they would have let you know. You would have showed up for ... nothing. As other Redditors said, it only takes a minute to send a text. I understand why that would upset you.\n\nYour policy does seem too rigid.

It's too late now and I doubt this woman would give you a second chance even if you wanted to.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE. \n\nNTA\n\nIt takes 15 seconds to reschedule and apologize, she had to work no one died (which would excuse her not communicating).

It\u2019s a bit harsh in my opinion. She should have contacted you as soon as she found out she was unable to make it.

Ok I'm reading a lot of comments about \"working in restaurants can be unpredictable\". It's a restaurant - not a hospital. Nothing is that urgent that she couldn't take a couple of seconds to text.

She waited for you to contact her to let you know she could not make it. She also did not offer an alternative date. That\u2019s rude.

Now you both either need to suck up the awkwardness for a while or you\u2019ll need to stop going to her place of work, because you obviously made her uncomfortable.", "Going with NAH. Some people are more casual about things, and aren't that bothered if something comes up. I've even seen people being super relieved that they don't have to go out after all when someone cancels, since they find going out stressful. \n\nI have found that people who cancel last minute more often don't seem bothered when others do the same. They're also more prone to dropping out as well if another person bails. \n\nBut... I am not casual about things. If someone cancels on me last minute it feels horrible. Often I've turned down other plans, or even bought food to feed them. I hate it and it genuinely ruins my whole day.\n\nDating is about getting to know someone. If her work means she often has to cancel last minute, then she would be a bad partner for me. \n\nIn future, though, I would try not to let your immediate feelings make the decision. Instead of \"I'm not interested in rescheduling\" maybe just \"Sure, let me get back to you tomorrow\"? And then if you still feel the same the next day when you've cooled down you can call it off. \n\nFinally, I think things will genuinely go a bit easier for you if you can learn to talk about your feelings. \"I'm not interested in rescheduling\" is a way to shut down that conversation. It cuts things off before you have to talk. \n\n\"I'd like to reschedule but I get really bummed out when plans get cancelled last minute. Are there any days or times you're definitely free?\"", "I mean if that's your boundary, no NTA, but this is how restaurants work....

If it were me, I'd reschedule once, but no more than that. But you're entitled to your own standards when making a date.", "NTA. Surprisingly first dates are to weed out the wheat from the chaff. Non communicative, uninterested or forgetful are all good reasons alone not to reschedule but any combo is a guaranteed chaff status! It takes a minute as soon as her boss \u2018made\u2019 her work extra. A quick apology asking for a do over would have been fine but you were not worth that small consideration! She messed up not you, you value communication and someone caring enough not to leave you hanging. Was she going to message at all if she forgot? Her coldness was also an indicator that you dodged a bullet anyone who couldn\u2019t see they were wrong and be apologetic, like I got snowed under and messed up but I think you should give me a second chance thinks that they were doing you a favour. Cold and distant is a this is how they handle conflict thing. You could have avoided going there for breakfast but you didn\u2019t she chose to pass up the chance to get back on track.", "NAH. It\u2019s hard to judge whether or not she was so busy she forgot to respond or if she wasn\u2019t really interested. People are dodgy or get cold feet and after a string of such experiences anyone would become jaded. I understand how you came about this policy and it\u2019s your decision. You have burned the bridge with this potential date at any rate. In the future I would consider giving someone one more chance if you really felt they were worth the effort but you must weigh the value of your time as well. Goodluck to you. Dating is difficult to say the least.", "NTA. I am the exact same, if someone makes me chase them so they can cancel on me, I see no reason to reschedule.", "NTA. I think if you didn\u2019t text her, you would have only known once you were at the restaurant and she didn\u2019t show up. She could have easily texted you first. I\u2019m sure she had a hectic day but realistically when was she going to let you know she wasn\u2019t unavailable? \nA better choice may have been to agree to a reschedule and see if she does show up, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not rescheduling.", "Um if you can't make it it's basic decency to inform the other person.

I'd be annoyed too, it takes me atleast an hour to get ready, if plans are set in stone either show up or inform me beforehand.", "This, plus manager likely didn\u2019t give her a choice to come in.

But you fucking tell the people you've made plans with.", "NTA. This is what I think too. A quick text to whoever you were meeting takes 1 minute. Yes, things come up - but individuals also need to be respectful of others time and efforts too.\n\nThe fact OP had to find out about it by confirming with her makes me think OP is right in this instance. Maybe if she had sent the text, then she should have another chance.\n\nBut she didn't bother telling OP until they contacted her. So OP was to go through getting prepared for the date until when? How much notice would OP have had?\n\nI like OP's policy, but would have the caveat ...unless they contact OP and communicate adequately.

What a bunch of numpties.", "Dude, she didn\u2019t flake on you, she got called into work. Her job is more important than drinks with you.

Maybe try counseling.", "You see , she had an issue because of work. \n\nYou created an issue because of your personality. \n\nIf she has any self respect, she'll say NO.", "If she was flaking for something stupid i would understand, work is a bit different though", "Don\u2019t bother apologizing in hopes of going out with her again. You\u2019ve shown your true personality, so if she has even a modicum of common sense, she will cross you off her list of possible relationships because you\u2019re rigid and somewhat unkind.   \n\nMaya Angelou said \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time\u201d.\n\nShe probably dreads you walking into her restaurant now.

Even at the last minute she didn't text her. If she had then ok. But even at the last minute she ( OP)  had to reach out. Thats not got anything to do with   a rescheduled shift. Thats OP taking the initiative. \n\nI know it isnt the same thing but if I'm being picked up by a family friend to do some shopping we always text before to confirm she's on her way and that I know she is. \n\nI dont leave her hanging after her on my way text. I text back right away okie dokie. That way she knows the shopping is still on. \n\nIts basic decency.", "I forgot to cancel/reschedule a date once, and only told him something came up when he texted asking where to meet (we were taking our dogs for a walk). \n\nI didn't tell him what had happened, just that something came up, but the truth was that my teenaged sister had tried to commit suicide. \n\nHe texted me a few days later asking if I wanted to try again. We're married now.", "Of course, she should lose her job for a date with a rando from a restaurant. \n\nWhat disrespect!", "I agree with you. It's just plain common decency to communicate and it takes 2 seconds to send a text no matter how busy you are unless it's an emergency situation. She flaked and didn't respect you enough to even bother letting you know and unfortunately this kind of thing is becoming very common these days and it shouldn't be.", "I have to disagree. First meeting = first impression. It's not rigid to ask the other person to be considerate with your time. Maybe OP said no to opportunities because they thought they had a planned activity.    I get having a busy day - but let's be honest here, a text takes 20 seconds to write. She had the time, she just didn't bother.", "It's not really up to OP to give her another chance now. He's burned that bridge.", "An hour before is absolutely last minute when we're talking about a date. Being ready an hour early is very normal, don't listen to this, OP.", "I am surprised the numpties haven't down voted this. OP actually discusses and listens.

You do seem that way.", "It\u2019s more like \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t make out having an accident or a moment of forgetfulness to be a major character flaw because you\u2019ve done it before too and obviously don\u2019t see it as a character flaw in yourself@. \n\nYou find last minute cancellations to be disrespectful but you\u2019ve done it. Did the person you canceled on cut you off?  Because you\u2019ve done it is it now fair for everyone in your life to assume you\u2019re a flake and will never keep plans?
