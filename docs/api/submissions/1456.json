I still think you should give her another chance, but that's lonely me talking, lol.  Good luck.", "The point is that an hour before isnt last minute.

I don't know about you but I have had hectic days that kept me from being able to text important information. It usually follows the thought pattern of, when I have a break I will text x person y information,  and then time passes without getting that break and before I know it I am texting x just before they need the info, or in one or two cases, too late. Or maybe your fears were right and she was just hoping you forgot, but I doubt it. Next time, take someone at their word the first time but then make sure it doesn't turn out to be a regular pattern of behavior of theirs.

Just misogyny is not one of them).", "Jumping in here to add that it's also common courtesy to check in on the day of to make sure all's well. You got annoyed because you were ready to go, but you got ready to go without confirming, which\u2026 I mean\u2026 Sure, I can see how in your mind there was a plan so you got ready, but a simple text that afternoon would've saved you both a lot of trouble.", "I would never expect a guy to be ready an hour before we are supposed to meet.  Not would i expect his \"getting ready\" to be anything to complain about doing.  \n\nSorry,  i think ESH.", "Well, you're treating her as if she had bad intentions. Like I said, you're policing boundaries too seriously for a first date. You don't know her.", "That\u2019s why I originally said makes sense (the lesbian bit). But FYI people don\u2019t offhandedly mention their sexuality at work to people they aren\u2019t into.

(I\u2019m not) second, why does that even matter? taking the time to shower, put on nice clothes, do your hair, makeup, etc for a plan that gets cancelled IS a waste of time", "It made sense in the context of the conversation.

Unfortunately, we live in a huge dumpster fire and people in the service industry catch some of the worst of it.\n\nHope you can smooth things over. Or, if not, that you have a better experience next time.", "Ok son i thiugh you said in your post that you were a guy, but i see now that you didn't. Thats my bad.\n\nHowever, it absolutely matter, because \"getting ready\" for a guy is what... showering, shaving, and dressing? All things he is likely to do anyway. Different for a girl because it takes way longer, so it makes more sense to be annoyed at having to go through the effort.\n\nAll thay said, i think youre still being too dramatic about it. And also thay she still could have let you know earlier. So... still ESH.", "time is time no matter the gender. some women take 5 minutes to get ready and some men take 2 hours. also men can wear makeup, spend time choosing outfits, etc. you should check your biases"]}
