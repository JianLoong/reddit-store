My adopted mother (88F) lives with me. It was a sort of closed adoption. She is the mother on my birth certificate. I am her only child, this was the only way for her and my father (rip) to have children. I grew up knowing I was adopted and while I\u2019ve got some issues, they\u2019re not with/because of her. I love her and she\u2019s my mom. \n\nWhen I turned 18, my birth mother found me. I eventually told my adopted parents and assured them that they were my parents first and foremost, but that I wanted to talk with her a bit. We did. Not too big a deal, mainly just check ins. Learning about more family. \n\nFast forward- I get married. My adopted mother insists I invite my birth mother to my wedding. I end up doing that. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met, awkward, but fine. We continue talking and such. It\u2019s been, oh, 16 years since that wedding day and I\u2019ve had kids. Now comes the weird part. \n\nBoth moms are friends on FB. Bio mom is younger and more savvy. She came out to visit this year and took pics with us and posted them. The caption read \u201cmy family.\u201d My adopted mom was pissed. Then this week the bio mom posted \u201cmy grandson\u2019s turning 11!\u201d My adopted mom hit the roof. She\u2019s mad that my bio mom is claiming me as her family and that my kids are her grandkids. She feels like we\u2019re replacing her. \n\nI pointed out she lives with us. My kids hug her and snuggle with her everyday. We don\u2019t want to replace her. She\u2019s struggling a little health wise and I know that\u2019s wearing on her. But she wants me to tell my bio mom to stop claiming us as her family and that\u2019s conflict I do NOT want. I\u2019m not even sure how I would say it to begin with. So now she\u2019s upset. I refrained from telling her that my and my husband\u2019s general policy on family is the more the merrier. The more people who love and watch out for us and our kids is a good thing. Truly I get where she\u2019s coming from, but I kinda told her it\u2019s not that big a deal and walked off when she wasn\u2019t getting it. Now she and I aren\u2019t really talking, and the rest of her family are trying to tell me to just do what she wants.", "created_utc": 1691439438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kvrfs/aita_for_not_wanting_to_defend_my_adopted_mother/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now to your adopted mom it looks like she is trying to swoop back into your life and act as though none of those years were missing. Technically she doesn't know you and you don't really know her. Sure she tells you stuff, but how do you know how much of it is true?\n\nIn a sense I think your being a little naive and should listen to your adopted mom. I know she suggested to invite her to the wedding, but still...How did your birth mother just 'find' you? Seems a little odd if it was a closed adoption.", "Gonna go with NAH. I don't think your bio is TA, especially after the Adopt mother insisted she be invited to the wedding, and back into your life. Pure speculation, is it possible she's getting old and worrying about being forgotten now that bio is back in the frame? Maybe have a sitdown with her.", "I mean, I agree with the everyone's family kind of deal. But I think the way you've hand waved away her concerns is honestly kind of shitty.\n\nYour adopted parents raised you with all the good and bad that is associated with child rearing and for your biological Mother to just start stepping in and taking credit for something she has never had to nurture is a slap in the face to the people who did all the heavy lifting.\n\nAt the very least, you could have had a talk with your bio Mom and asked her to tone it down or something.\n\nYTA", "NAH, your Mom kind of brought this on herself when she insisted on inviting your Bio mom to your wedding and keeping up an online friendship with her. She invited her in and is now upset that she is claiming some minor family links to you.\n\nIt definitely might be worth sitting your Mom down again and letting her know that you are not going to put restrictions on your bio Mom, but that doesn't reduce her place in your life at all. This could all just be some latent insecurities popping up, especially now that she is on the older side, but I definitely don't think she is an asshole either for feeling this way.", "I think bio mom is TA", "Bio mom should not be posting that sort of thing. She was not your mother, she did not raise you, so to say \u201cmy family\u201d and \u201cmy grandson\u201d is a slap in the face to your adoptive mother in my eyes. You should open your eyes to see this as well.", "NTA at all, but is this kind of expression of anger out of character from your mom? It seems to be, since she was originally including your bio-mother? If it\u2019s not normal\u2026might she be starting to show signs of dementia?\n\nI ask because:\n\nMy own grandmother Dorothy had a baby \u201cout of wedlock\u201d back when that was a problem, and was \u201csent to stay with an aunt for the summer.\u201d That aunt sent flowers every single year on the same day. \n\nThat baby, Dianna, was given up for adoption. Only when Dianna\u2019s own adopted mother got dementia did she find her adoption papers and reach out to her birth mother, my grandmother, Dorothy.\n\nGrandma Dorothy didn\u2019t tell any of us that they reconnected because of her shame ( :(, we are a progressive family! At least my generation is! This makes us so sad she felt this way!), and she then got dementia.\n\nWe eventually found cards from Dianne and contacted her (thinking she was somehow scamming my grandmother).\n\nShe was so sad, because she thought that my grandma Dorothy had walked away from Dianna after they reconnected, however, grandma had regressed and while she remembered having Dianna, she did not recall that they had reconnected, that was her point in dementia regression.\n\nOnce we all understood that, it was easier to deal with.\n\nFacebook has an auto-hide feature, if your bio-mom is more savvy you can ask her \u201chey, my adopted mom originally wanted us to reconnect, but as her health ails her behaviour is changing and this is threatening to her. I don\u2019t want anything to change between you and I, but can you just click the \u201cchoose audience\u201d and select \u201cfriends, except\u201d and click your bio mom\u2019s name. You can set this up one time or permanently.\n\nAlso, if your mom lives with you, you can go to *her* settings in Facebook while she is asleep and \u201cunfollow\u201d your bio-mom from her account. They will stay friends, but she won\u2019t get updates to her newsfeed. If you don\u2019t do this in conjunction with the \u201chide from\u201d keep in mind she can still find it if she goes to to it bio-moms profile page.", "NAH, except maybe Bio mom. She kind of is crossing a line claiming you and your children when she wasnt there. She could be present without stepping on toes.", "NTA but don\u2019t forget who chose you. The more the merrier, sure, but being extra caring and respectful of your adopted mother seems like it needs to come first.", "NAH, except maybe bio mom.  I understand where your mom is coming from.  Bio mom sounds attention seeking.  But I understand you not wanting to fight that fight too.", "At the end of the day, you get to decide who you want to keep in your family. But even so, your adoptive mom has the right to be angry about this, as she was the one who raised you, compared to your bio mom just visiting you every so often since you turned 18.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you what to do with your family, I\u2019m just saying that your bio mom is right is some regard. In this situation, I would talk to your adoptive mom about how you aren\u2019t replacing her, she will always be your mother, and that you can\u2019t exactly control what your bio mom does. Your adoptive mom might also be thinking that because of her old age, your bio mom is trying to replace her once she (unfortunately) dies. I\u2019m not trying to be insensitive, I\u2019m just trying to say the possibilities of what she might be thinking.\n\nThis is a tough place to be in, but I would do whatever I could to make it up with my adoptive mom.", "NTA.  It sounds like your adoptive mom has been supportive in all aspects--until it got to social media. She's okay having bio mom in your life and even in her own life, but she doesn't want the world to view her as being replaced. So, while you have no duty to cater to AHs, if it were me, I would explain the situation to younger/savvier bio mom and ask her to block adopted mom if she's going to post stuff like that just to keep the peace.", "NTA. I share the same take on family (the more the merrier), as long as nobody is toxic. You might have to sit with your mom and explain to her how much you love her.", "NAH. I totally get adopted mom (real mom imo) feeling slighted. She did all the hard work on the group project and the person who did the least is plenty quick to point out their name on the credits. But reality is it\u2019s like having a second child, and trying to convince the first it doesn\u2019t mean you love them less. \n\nAt the same time I get where bio mom is coming from too. No idea why she put OP up for adoption but benefit of the doubt for an adoption at birth, it might have been a circumstantial necessity and not due to being a bad person. There\u2019s no reason you two can\u2019t have a relationship if you want, and they are her biological grandkids.  \n\nHonestly OP, sounds like the mom\u2019s need to have a heart-to-heart. It might go a long way if Bio mom sincerely thanked adopted mom for raising you to be the kind of person you\u2019ve become. But if I *had* to choose? I\u2019d choose to support the person that supported me.", "NAH: You have a valid point, but your adoptive mom is scared of dying and being replaced. Considering she was okay with your bio mom before and now isn't and is also in poor health it's only logical.\n\nYou're reassuring her she's your mom, but it may not be enough. Would it be the end of the world if you asked your bio mom to tone down the 'family' wordage? She could still post as many pics as she wants.", "You could ask your bio mom to exclude her from posts like that. I have done it for other reasons. It's a setting for post audience. You can choose \"Friends except...\". I only have done it if a post would hurt someone's feelings due to their unique circumstances, not as some kind of lie. \n\nI think your elderly mom is really worried about being forgotten when she is gone, and she sees her replacement closing in. It's a hard time in her life. \n\nNTA. You are an extremely lucky woman to have two moms who love you this much.", "As an adoptive parent, NTA at all. My daughter\u2019s birth parents *are* family, both hers and mine. If they are still in her life and excited to be bonus grandparents if she has kids of her own someday I\u2019d be overjoyed. Adoption means expanding your heart and your definition of \u2018family\u2019 to make room for all the different ways a child can be loved by many people, and not letting your ego get in the way of your child\u2019s well-being.\n\nShe needs to deal with her feelings with a therapist and stop putting them on you, period.", "NTA - you absolutely should remind your mom of your policy, and you should add that your kids are short one grandparent at least already so there\u2019s space for you to \u201cadopt\u201d your bio mom into that space.\n\nThat said, your mom clearly has a lot of insecurity and talking things over with her and reassuring her seems like a good idea; and some family therapy might also help you and she to find a way to define your relationships to your bio mom.", "NAH this sounds like your mums emotional battle to wrestle with. You can belong to more than one family", "NTA.  I always think it's cool when an adoptee finds their birth parent(s) (or vice versa) and they are able to strike up a positive relationship.  So, nothing wrong with your birth mother saying \"my family\" or \"my grandson\".  In this case, your grandson has **two** maternal grandmothers.  How lucky is he?", "NTA. But your mom and \"the rest of her family\" actually are. You are an adult and have a right to let those who want to be your family to be it. You are not diminishing your adoptive mother's major role in your life and the life of your kids by one iota by treating your bio-mom with decency and allowing her a role in you and your kids lives. Your mom is out of line and would recommend you standing firm on this. Tell her (don't discuss-tell) that you've heard her opinion, but the subject is now permanently closed. If she persists, leave the room.", "LOL NTA just don\u2019t move your other mom in after she died I guess or you\u2019ll actually be replacing her", "Yeah, your bio mom is okay to do that that but also she wasn't there for you, not sure if she like gave you up but she wants to come back and be the mom again, no she doesn't really deserve it, you adopted mom has been there for you all the way so yeah you kinda of are even tho I get your apprehension", "I\u2019m going with YTA.  \nYou are basically saying that your bio mum is just as much your mum as your adopted mum.  \nYour adopted mum is your REAL mum.  \nI totally understand why she would be upset by this.  \nYour bio mum was never there during the tough times and now it\u2019s easy she wants to claim she\u2019s equal to your real mum ?   \nHave some respect and compassion for your real mum who feels she is being pushed aside", "I think there are NAH, although the bio mom is starting to reach into AH territory. But she\u2019s not a villain for celebrating your kids birthday on social media. Maybe you should chat with her if it gets to be too much, but it seems fine for now.", "NTA. She pushed you to make bio mom feel included for one if your biggest milestones. And now she doesn't like how close and entitled she's become of the family she pushed her to be apart of? You can't have it both ways.", "NTA but what an interesting situation.", "I get both sides. NTA but your mom was the one who was there for you when you were sick, got your heart broken! I think you need to talk to her again that she will never be replaced and that you are welcoming her bio mom but she\u2019s not your number one mom. You", "You're the asshole.. You were raised by someone else who literally devoted their life to you. Sorry but bio mom is literally a donor. She can be a significant part of your life as a family friend.. But how is she family when she barely knows you?", "NTA\n\nShe's not being one either, just having difficulty processing everything. In fact, you might want to get your mom checked for additional health issues.\n\nBut, I'd suggest you no longer tell her why you won't approach bio mom on this subject, just tell her no. If she brings it up again, say, \"I told you no. It's not up for discussion and I will leave the room if you try to bring it up again.\" And do just that.\n\nIntroduce other topics of conversation.\n\nFinally, you should suggest some counseling for her. That level of jealousy given her role in your family's life is outsized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But publicly claiming the grandkids like that is a little AH'ish to me. Social media is weird--it's kind of a performance you put on for other people.

I have a few questions- how do you refer to bio parent? Do your children know bio parent? If so, how do they refer to her?\n\nI ask this because I am in contact with both of my adoptive parents and all my bio half siblings. We are all super careful to not cross that boundary/social media line. In general, I don\u2019t even post pics of friends without their permission, so I\u2019m surprised by your bio parent\u2019s actions. I actually think it warrants a conversation with her. She has to know that people may ask you or her \u201cgrandson\u201d about her posts. I\u2019d actually be quite annoyed if someone put my son in that position. So, to me, this should be an open discussion with her- \u201cI saw you posted some pics tagging us recently and one in which you referred to xxxxx as your grandson. Can you tell me why you did that?\u201d and just listen. Once she\u2019s done explaining or reacting, you might say \u201cI hear you, but in the future, please don\u2019t tag us/refer to us as xxxxxxx without checking first.\u201d It help to have open communication and clear boundaries in these relationships.\n\nAs for your mom, she\u2019s getting older, facing her own mortality, and may be afraid of being forgotten. \n\nI think the best thing you can do as an adoptee is have clear and open communication in these relationships.", "Can you really say that she's trying to swoop back into OP's life when it's been 21 years since she first got in contact with OP?

I say this as someone who has a brother who was adopted, and found his birth mother as an adult, as the niece of an adopted uncle, as the grandmother of a foster child who is shared between my daughter and his bio family (my daughter's best friend is his bio aunt) and as the friend of a couple of women who have given children up for adoption. Adopted families are gloriously messy, but there is room for all.\n\nMy main concern reading what you've written is your mom's seeming change of heart and her fear at being replaced. Paranoia of this type, when it has not been present before, can be indicative of the early stages of dementia. If your mother hasn't had a recent medical checkup, that would be a place to start. Mention your concerns to her doctor.\n\nAnd don't cut off communication with your mom. Don't tell her it's no big deal, because to her it clearly is. Do keep hugging her and telling her you love her.", "I'm leaning NAH, but it's hard without more context. I have a similar story to yours--I'm in my 30s, was adopted in a closed adoption, am now in contact with my birthmother.\n\nLanguage can be an issue, particularly with people outside either of my immediate families, who call my birthmom my \"mom\" instead of my \"birthmom\" or something like that. For the most part I try to be polite but firm and just keep restating the more correct and preferred terminology.\n\nMy birthmom refers to me as her daughter because that's what I am biologically and because unlike adoptive/biological for parents, there's no similar set of terms to describe us, the offspring. \"My daughter I gave up for adoption\" isn't really appropriate or useful, and if she were to say that to a coworker or something, it would be confusing, because it's obvious that we know each other and have a relationship. I've never asked my parents if they feel any sort of way about her calling me \"my daughter,\" but I don't think they do, because they know the language *I* use, and they know that she refers to THEM as my parents! I'm her daughter, but she's not my mom, and all parties are very clear on that. I would describe our relationship as more of an aunt/niece type of thing, and I'm lucky that her close family (my bio fam) and my (adoptive) family have all met and gotten along really well and are facebook friends and stuff.\n\nSo I'm inclined to say your adoptive mom (ie \"your mom\") is overreacting and being too sensitive and self-centered, and it's just that your biological mom just doesn't have any other options because English doesn't allow for them! In general, English has more options overall and more fluidity when it comes to how we use terms for adult relatives (cf how many cultures use things like \"aunt\" and \"uncle\" whether it's your actual aunt/uncle or just a close friend, for example), and it just doesn't have them for child relatives. You just have kids/grandkids or cousins or nieces/nephews. So she's just using what she has available to her, and your entire family should just be happy that there are more people in the family who love each other and have each other's backs!\n\nBuuuut if your bio mom has used any other language that suggests she doesn't recognize your parents as your parents and herself as a loved, valued adult who is *not* a parent, then I would be willing to see your adoptive mom's side...", "NTA\n\nIt can be really hard to navigate between adopted mothers and birth mothers. \n\nAll you can really do is keep on reassuring your mum that she's not being replaced. If you feel good about your birth mother calling your kids her grandchildren, all the better. \n\nIt's not actually your job to manage your mum's feelings about this, aside from \"you're still my mum, I'm not replacing you.\"", "OPs mom has the issue and is friends with bio mom herself, so she should be the one to talk to her about it. It is highly unfair of mom to make OP do that, as it may not even be fully representative of how she feels. OP is entitled to have her mom and her bio mom.", "> maybeeee just vet the bio mom a little more before you move her in and leave her in charge of your children?\n\n\nIt's the adopted mother who currently lives with them.  He was trying to reassure her.", "Actually, legally it's NOT true that OP is bio mom's child and her child is bio mom's grandchild. It is true biologically. It's one of those areas where language and custom have not yet caught up to reality, and everyone needs to forge their own path.", "She isn\u2019t being treated that way.", "Most people, especially back then, did not adopt out their children for \"convenience\". \n\nFor many of them it was one of the worst days of their life. Forced adoptions were common not long before OP was born, and after that emotional blackmail was frequently used.\n\nThere was big money in the adoption industry for a very long time. \n\nInferring that this particular birth mother was using the adoption for baby sitting is offensive and you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.", "You never know, as time goes on your mum might feel more and more secure.\n\nMy mine encouraged me to find my birth mother, and then immediately got the shits up about it. \n\nMany decades later and she's the one saying to me \" Have you called *birth mum*? How's she going?\" \n\nMind you, I'm 51 and my mum is 82. She now considers my birth mum (67 just for the record) a kind of quasi-daughter/sister/neice.", "Closed adoptions aren't forced on mothers .. Some prefer it that way.", "Yeah whatever. As someone else pointed out the adoption was more than likely not his biological Mother's choice, which leads to believe it may have been drug related.\n\nI just don't have any sympathy for her, it's a shame OP can't garner more sympathy for the person who actually cared for them.", "My birth mother had a screen put in front of her face so she couldn't see me, and was made to leave the hospital as soon as she could walk steadily.\n\nShe didn't want to give me away, it's what was done then. No options unless your family was willing to take in the child, and had money. \n\nOtherwise the child when to a \"decent married couple\".", "I think that's up to the daughter to decide, don't you.", "That\u2019s why she\u2019s here. On Reddit. For opinions.", "Info. Does bio mum ask your permission before posting photos and info about your kids online?", "YTA. You are basically telling her that value bio-mom over her. I would feel the same. In a contest, adopted mother will lose. Adopted mom is thrown away.", "Nta. It only matters if you have an issue with your bio mom calling you family and your kids her grandson. If you do than I would say something. If you actually deep down like that your bio mom calls you by family terms that\u2019s okay too. & if you feel neutral, you could either do it to appease your adopted mom or not. Neither choose would be wrong. But it\u2019s important to talk with your (adopted) mom and let her know that you love and cherish her and how she feels."]}
