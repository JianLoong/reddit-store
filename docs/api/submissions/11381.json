{"id": 11381, "submission_id": "11h71m3", "title": "AITA for telling my dad he needs to pay for what his dog did?", "selftext": "I (31f) agreed to watch my dad's (54m) dog last weekend. He's not a puppy anymore, and he's a fairly large dog, probably about 90-100 pounds. He's also got a lot of energy and can run really fast. That being said, he's not very good at stopping when he runs at full speed.\n\nOn the afternoon of the incident, I was playing with the dog. We were playing with a tennis ball, and I wasn't throwing it very hard. I'd bounce it on the floor, it would go a few feet away, and he'd catch it and bring it back. Normal stuff. At least, it was until he missed. On one toss, he didn't get his mouth around the ball. It took a weird bounce off of his nose, and it happened to towards the coffee table where I have temporarily placed my TV until my new TV standing comes in.\n\nBy now, most of you can probably figure out what happened. Dad's dog went running at full speed towards the errant ball, crashed into the coffee table, and the TV toppled over and onto the floor. Unfortunately, it fell screen side down, causing it to break against the hardwood floor.\n\nThe next day, I told my dad what happened. I asked him to replace it because, although it was an accident, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't had the dog in there in the first place. He says it's my fault because I shouldn't have been tossing the ball in the first place. He also says he doesn't think he should pay for a new TV. What do you think Reddit? AITA here?\n\nEdit: Okay! I get it! Don't play ball in the house. Yes, I've heard that. Didn't really need the extra 300 comments telling me the same thing. To give you all some perspective, yes, I do have a large living room. The TV and table were way off and out of the way. Zeus is a large dog. The ball was *not* being tossed in any general direction of the TV. It bounced that way after it hit his nose. It was the result of several improbable circumstances. I don't mind y'all saying YTA, but your comments are just getting repetitive and stating the extremely obvious. Why wasn't a park or outside an option? For one, I live nowhere near a park. Two, it was FREEZING outside. Colder then a witch's tit in a brass bra as they say.", "created_utc": 1677864190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11h71m3/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_needs_to_pay_for_what/", "score": 812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's not a puppy anymore, and he's a fairly large dog, probably about 90-100 pounds. He's also got a lot of energy and can run really fast. That being said, he's not very good at stopping when he runs at full speed.\n\nOn the afternoon of the incident, I was playing with the dog. We were playing with a tennis ball, and I wasn't throwing it very hard. I'd bounce it on the floor, it would go a few feet away, and he'd catch it and bring it back. Normal stuff. At least, it was until he missed. On one toss, he didn't get his mouth around the ball. It took a weird bounce off of his nose, and it happened to towards the coffee table where I have temporarily placed my TV until my new TV standing comes in.\n\nBy now, most of you can probably figure out what happened. Dad's dog went running at full speed towards the errant ball, crashed into the coffee table, and the TV toppled over and onto the floor. Unfortunately, it fell screen side down, causing it to break against the hardwood floor.\n\nThe next day, I told my dad what happened. I asked him to replace it because, although it was an accident, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't had the dog in there in the first place. He says it's my fault because I shouldn't have been tossing the ball in the first place. He also says he doesn't think he should pay for a new TV. What do you think Reddit?

Just to reiterate 1. Don\u2019t play ball inside 2. Don\u2019t have your TV just sitting on a coffee table when you know you have a clumsy giant staying with you and 3. Certainly don\u2019t do both of these things in unison, that\u2019s on you\u2026\n\nYTA", ">I don't mind y'all saying YTA, but your comments are just getting repetitive and stating the extremely obvious.\n\nToo bad \"don't play ball inside with a big ass dog\" wasn't obvious enough for you to not play ball inside with a big ass dog.

Not obvious enough to you, considering the state of your tv. \ud83d\ude02", "Only commenting because your edit was ridiculous.  I think you needed to see HOW MANY PEOPLE thought YTA for ALL THE SAME REASONS.  With that big of a dog, and with the energy you know this dog has- SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THROWING THE BALL.  Hope you have more clarity now.", "It is perfect for this situation!!", "You should take the dog to court, OP, and sue him for damages. /s - YTA.", "I swear, I sometimes think there should be a YTDA option (You're The Dumbass) because how this guy can think anyone else is to blame for tossing a ball towards a TV and expecting any other outcome......huh, wait a tic, I wonder if OP was fishing for a new TV?", "Oh man OP got a bolded YTA here. Nice.", "You don't play fetch indoor with a 30 pound dog.", "I love \"fetch around and find out\" SO much. Let me know when the merch with this gem gets printed!!", "This made start laughing so hard, I cried real tears. Thank you for this", "I have tossed balls or toys in my house for my Puppies as a way to start teaching fetch. But it was along a hall, with nothing dangerous at either end. By the time the dogs were bigger, we had moved it outside & invested in a chuck-it. Best Invention EVER for fetch, IMHO :)", "Seriously. My dogs are dumbasses. So the tv is wall mounted now.", ">Isn't 'don't throw balls in the house' like standard common sense? Or at least something drilled into us by dozens of sitcoms over the last 70 years?\n\nAnd maybe even HER FATHER?!?!?", "I'll play fetch with our puppy inside. Mostly cause it's snowy outside.  And he's also only 10 lbs. \n\nI still only play fetch in a hallway that doesn't have anything breakable and all the doors are shut, so his toy can go bouncing randomly away.", "No, it's not the dog's fault, it's the ball's fault for bouncing off of the floor in the first place.", "Frfr my dog would never \ud83d\ude44 /s", "45 lbs dog owner here, I used to play ball in the house with her at our old place.

They shouldn\u2019t have been so bouncy.", "Proof: no tvs were ever broken before that moment, QED", "What is wrong with all of you?? It\u2019s obviously the tv\u2019s fault because it should\u2019ve landed screen side up!!", "No, it's the table's fault for not adequately holding the TV in place!", "Nah its the floor's fault. It litterally chose to smash the screen of the tv."]}
