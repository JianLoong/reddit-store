Your biological father is trying to encourage you to get over the death of your actual dad on his terms. \n\nPlease hold space for yourself, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Sounds like your bio dad is overstepping into your \"real\" (step) dad's role and that's seriously overstepping and bad timing to boot. You're allowed to grieve. He's not allowed to try to take your stepdad's place. And he certainly shouldn't be trying to control you or your mother. No idea why she's listening to him.", "NTA\nFirst off, i'm very sorry for your loss \nYour bio dad has no right to command you like that at all.\nJust do what feels right by you and properly grieve. If you mess that up now, you might carry it with you for years.\nWhen your dad complains, say that you'll wait with doing what he says for as much time he  left  (abandoned) you alone when you were a kid", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYour bio dad doesn\u2019t get to opt out of parenting for most of your life then enter it with lectures and scolding.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable doing so, ask your mom to be the buffer here and tell him to back off.\n\nGrieve in your way, in your time, in your space. Do not let anyone rush you or demand more of you than you\u2019re able to give.", "NTA \n\nCondolences for your parents passing away\u2026 it must a traumatic time for you\u2026 \n\nYour bio dad has been absent for most of your life - suddenly he expects to become the parental authority and sees the untimely death of your stepfather as an opportunity to do that - seems like he lacks the emotional intelligence to be a parent\u2026 \n\nYou are not an awful daughter at all - if anyone is terrible it\u2019s your bio dad for not being patient and mindful of your grief and expecting to treat him like the dad of the century \n\nYou cannot rush and recover from grief - tell your bio dad he needs to be patient. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why your mom should postpone life arrangements for stepdad because your dad demands it though", "First off,  im so sorry for your loss \u2764  2nd..absolutely NO ONE gets to tell you how to grieve. End of story. What works for your bio dad may not work for you and thats OK. If he doesn't grasp that, well thats a him problem, not a you problem. Id set some clear boundaries with him as far as your grief, and what ever else you feel uncomfortable about with him.", "Also..he does NOT get to decide when celebration of life is. Do it when you guys need yo, so you can start getting some closure.", "NTA but your dad is. what gives him the right to demand anything when it comes to the services for your stepdad's funeral proceedings? your bio-dad hasn't been there for you, he walked out. you aren't obligated to have him in your life, especially at 16. you're old enough the courts just ask you which parent you want to live with. your dad lost any right to be in your life when he walked out.\n\nany relationship you have with your bio-dad should be on YOUR terms when YOU are ready and not one second before. if he's such a jerk you and your mom need to ignore him and do what's best for the two of you. you're both dealing with enough right now and don't need his BS.", "This is a horrible situation... I have not been in your place... I understand needing time to grieve... but I understand the your dad's insistence to get back to school... I would never take 3 weeks off for a death other than maybe my own childs... but I don't decide your grieving process... bio dad has no right to tell your mother when she should have the celebration of life... I would suggest getting a therapist for both of you to learn better communication skills with each other", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
