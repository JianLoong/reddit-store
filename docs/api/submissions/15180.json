{"id": 15180, "submission_id": "12ruf5t", "title": "AITA for getting angry at my mum for telling my kids what I was like at their age?", "selftext": "I (31F) love my mother (58) but she is so vindictive sometimes that it\u2019s difficult to be around. If someone cuts her off in traffic, she will sometimes go *out of her way* to tailgate them. One of her friends was feeling a little ashamed about turning 60 soon and hadn\u2019t spoken about it to many of her friends and my mum posted all over her Facebook page \u201cHappy 59th!!\u201d and, when I told her that it wasn\u2019t very nice at all, she replied with: \u201cOh well, everybody knows that I\u2019m 60 soon, so everyone gets to know that she\u2019s almost 60 too.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, I think I got a really cruddy start in terms of getting into the habit of doing chores. When I was very little, it was all about staying out of my mum\u2019s way, but, when I was older, my mum just started expecting me to do things despite not being taught to do them and previously being told to just stay away when she\u2019s cooking or cleaning. I\u2019m neurodivergent so I found the abrupt change very inexplicable and stressful and fought it (mostly because it was something like \u201ccan you chop up all the things for dinner so I can just throw it on the stove later?\u201d when I\u2019d never been taught how to use a knife). Honestly, I didn\u2019t really get the hang of keeping up a household until it was my own.\n\nI\u2019m determined for my own kids (6&7M) not to go through the same thing and, as a result, I\u2019ve gotten them to help with things even when they were so little that their help was more of a hinderance - just so they knew *how* to do things when they\u2019re old enough to do them on their own and they got into the habit of it. As a result, I got them on a great little regimen that included (non-breakable) dish washing, lunch making and even laundry! \n\nHOWEVER, my parents visited my new house from a couple of hours away for dinner last week with my boys, my partner (33M) and I and, after dinner, my mum caught sight of the boys helping out with the dishes the other night. When we were done, she made a rather snide comment to them to the tune of: \u201cYour mummy never did that when she was your age. You know, she never did anything like that.\u201d \n\nAfter that night, my kids have mostly just brought up that I probably didn\u2019t do the task when I was their age whenever they\u2019ve usually helped out ever since. I\u2019m furious.\n\nI called my mum up yesterday to complain and her only response was: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t tell them to do that, and it\u2019s the truth. You did nothing around the house.\u201d My dad thinks she should have been more careful with her words, but he\u2019s very \u201cwhat are you going to do about it?\u201d My partner also said: \u201cWell, she was just telling them what you were like at their age and it\u2019s just a natural consequence that they\u2019re going to think it\u2019s unfair that they do all this stuff after they know that you didn\u2019t.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so annoyed but I feel like everyone around me is telling me that what my mum said was completely okay and not just another instance where she\u2019s being vindictive the expense of everything else. Is my anger justified?

Your mother was being mean.  I think it would have been okay for you to respond in the moment in front of your kids like \"That's true.  I didn't get the chance to learn how to do these tasks, so it was harder for me when I was old enough to be independent.\" and you should be giving your kids that message now - \"we think it's important for everyone to learn how to help take care of the house and the other people in it\"", "Honestly, from what you wrote, I don\u2019t see anything lovable about your mother. She comes across as small-minded, self-centered, and, yes - vindictive. So I am not sure why you felt like beginning with \u201cI love this person\u201d. Is it, like, Stockholm Syndrome of some sort?\n\nIndeed, you father is correct - although he probably meant it figuratively - what are you going to do about it? My suggestion is to take his question literally, and to stop cutting slack someone who is objectively cruel and malicious towards people.\n\nNTA", "**NTA.** I'd straight-up tell my kids, \"While that is true, it's because she wouldn't *let* me help. I wish my mother *had* taught me how to properly care for a household. As a grown-up on my own, I didn't know what to do, or even how to do it. I want better for you. I don't want you to feel the stress I felt over not knowing how to take care of things in the home. I want you to grow up more comfortable with yourself, and your abilities. I'm doing this because I love you.\"", "Your mom was being vindictive. She's lying when she says it was about, \"telling the truth.\" Her words were meant to stir animosity. You have a right to be upset that your mother is trying to turn your kids against you with words like that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mother seems one of those people who is rude and expects that everyone accommodates to her.\n\nIf you talk to her and she doesn't even acknowledge that you are an adult with your own family, and other people has rights too... I would reevaluate how close to family she is. Edit- wording", "NTA. If your mom is wont to make passive aggressive comments like these, please do your children a favor and break the cycle of abuse by limiting contact with her. Do not let her undermine your parenting.", "NTA. She did it intentionally to make your kids question you. Whether or not you did it at their age is down to *your* parents, and whether or not your kids do it is down to *you and your partner*.\n\nIf your mom can't keep her mouth shut with passive aggressive comments like that, limit her contact with your kids (and you) until she can.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Never invite her over again. Show her what vindictive really means when she doesn\u2019t get to see her grandchildren anymore", "Tell your kid what you told us. And that gran just want to start drama in your house. Maybe she's jealous.", "NTA, your mother is a narcissist.Cut her out, don't let her near the kids. She's clearly trying to poison their minds.Tell the kids their grandma is sick and likes to say things that aren't true, and move along with life without her. Can explain a bit better later on", "NTA\n\nYou and your partner are not on the same page. Presumptively, he already knows how your mother intentionally set you up for criticism from an early age. I don't expect him to be outraged on your behalf. I would hope for more support on how their grandmother's interference is sabotage. But we really can't feed people the words they must use when speaking to us. He's probably just staying out of the minefield that is you and your mother's relationship.\n\nYour dad is also. The isn't any winning with your mom.\n\nSo what you say to your mom may escalate so you're going to dish up a big bowl of truth. It doesn't have to come from a place of anger. You're raising your children to be helpful around the house so they can be confident and independent not waiting for the next wave of criticism to hit them and undermine their efforts. It's the unintentional lesson your mother taught you. You need to be careful to not have these discussions in front of your children. You aren't going to come away from the talk feeling as though your mom has had an epiphany. She's going to need to chew on it for a while. You might have to go low contact afterwards. It's not likely she's figured out we learn more from our children than we teach them.", "YTA, that\u2019s some pretty standard shit lol. I remember being a kid and my mom telling me that one day Im going to have a child who will put me through everything that I put her through. That shit stuck with me all the way to adulthood and it\u2019s certainly true.\n\nWhat goes around comes around.", "NTA\n\n\n\nMy aunts told me about my mums \"wild days\" (no real scandales) as I was 17/18- not earlier. These kids can't really evaluate the worth of being taught to be independent or healthy habbits. I would still try to explain to them but your mom definitly just wanted to stir shit up.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re very fond of your Mom. That\u2019s okay. You can love her & still not like her behavior. You can be annoyed but she\u2019s probably not going to change. Probably best not to waste your time & energy. \n\nThis is a conversation to have with your children & be honest of why you are teaching them life skills so early. You have very good reasons. They can know about you when you were younger & still respect that you are their mother. Kids don\u2019t really have a good grasp understanding that their parents were once their age & didn\u2019t have all the answers. \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nThey're your kids, put fourth consequences.", "Well she is right. You never had to do this at that age. I guess your children don't like doing this kind of work and would rather play.\n\nYou should have prepared an answer to that argument when you started to force them into it.\n\nYTA", "NTA, OP. I can well sympathize. My mother did a very similar thing to me and my daughter.", "NTA. Your mother was being vindictive, especially in her approach, and what she said has consequences. She\u2019s probably all proud of herself now that your kids are acting like that too. You mother sounds like a hassle. Could be a good time to go low contact. If they put up a fuss it sounds like you have plenty of reasons why, this is just the straw that broke the camels back. Good luck OP", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
