My father had him when I was in my 20s, so I always spoiled my little brother whenever I visited my pop's house because after he was born, my father couldn't work anymore due to illness and wasn't bringing in much money anymore.

My stepmother took a liking to the baby and my father reluctantly agreed to take him in like he was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\n\nAt first, whenever I visited, I'd keep him in mind whenever I thought of bringing pizza or some other food over. I never got him anything for his birthday, but I'd get him something small on Christmas so he doesn't feel left out when I'd bring my brother something and I'd give him a little bit of money, though not as much as my brother, whenever I visited. When I took out my brother, I'd include him as well, so he doesn't feel left out.\n\nBut in the last few years, his own father has started a small one-man business and he's now making like 3-4 times more what I'm making. At the same time my father's health declined and money was getting tight around the house. But this guy wouldn't take back his own kid. So my father and stepmother were footing the bill for this kid, even while his father was perfectly capable. I understand that maybe they didn't want to move the boy somewhere else and completely change schools, lose his friends or whatever, but he's still a little a kid, so he'll get over it.\n\nMy father died in 2018 before the pandemic started and the economy started tanking due to it. Money was already tight because he wasn't working and my stepmother had to get a job and basically be his nurse until his death. But after my father's death, I found out about her brother's business and how well off he was. The mother is still an addict and/or dead somewhere in the streets which means she's still out of the picture.

Definitely N T A for not bringing the presents. He\u2019s not your kid, and kudos to you for doing as much as you have.\n\nThe only thing nagging at me is whether or not you communicated your decision before you came over? I only ask because the expectation has been set for the nephew that you will bring him something, and he may not understand why he all of a sudden doesn\u2019t get anything.\n\nI\u2019m not at all concerned about the opinions of the adults here, just the nephew.", "NTA, why didn't you mention what a cad the nephew's father is?!", "NTA why is his father not taking him back?", "YTA for not treating your step-brother as family (he lived in your father's house. They raised him. He's your step-brother then, not stepmother's nephew).\n\nNTA for having to downsize for Christmas this year.", "YTA.\n\n1) The child was had in your 20s which means you\u2019re now either nearing or well into your 30s. It\u2019s time for you to grow up.\n\n2) That man\u2019s financial situation is not any of your business. Get a better job\u2014 stop being bitter.\n\n3) Children, regardless of their surrounding circumstances and the shitty adults that made/ raised them, do not deserve to be punished for adult affairs. Who cares what the immature adults in his life are saying\u2014 the gift you give him only makes his day brighter. It doesn\u2019t affect them; therefore their stupid comments shouldn\u2019t affect you.", "NTA - does your Stepmothers brother bring any gifts for your nephew? If not then there is a clear case of double standards for what your stepmother expects from you both", "Without giving too much specifics. I'm in my mid 30s, lil bro is late teens, and his cousin is early teens.", "I'm not gonna lie to make myself look good like a lot of people do on this sub. So I'll admit that I didn't let anybody know I was only bringing my brother gifts. But here's the kicker, my stepmother's brother, who's my brother's biological uncle, didn't even bring my brother any gifts this Christmas and his reasoning is that, since he's started helping out around the house after my father died by buying the monthly groceries and sometimes helping out with the bills, that that is enough for my brother and my stepmother.", "I don't know. Maybe it's a mix of not completely disturbing the kid's life, my stepmother growing too attached to him like he's her son, and his own father not wanting to take responsibility and basically getting to live his life without taking custody.", "Found the step uncle.", "He's not my nephew because I'm not related by blood to him. He's my stepmother's nephew. And I couldn't mention it because of the character limit, but my stepmother's brother has NEVER brought my brother any gifts on his birthday or for Christmas to the extent of my knowledge.\n\nI'll admit that I COULD be wrong because I don't live there and my stepmother's brother visits almost on a weekly basis while I only go around once a month. So there's a possibility he might hit my brother off with a couple bucks here and there, but I've never asked him if he's ever gotten at least, some money from him. This feels petty as hell, but I'm finally gonna ask my bro today if he's been getting money from his uncle on these special occasions. Because I've never seen a Christmas gift from this guy for my brother, except when he was a little kid when he brought him a bike one time. I definitely didn't see him give him anything this year, but like I said, I COULD be wrong and he might've given him some money I don't know about instead of a gift.", "Can you start bringing your brother to your place on holidays instead of you going there? That way nobody has to see him opening your presents. Your dad is no longer there. Do you have a desire to see your SM or were you just going for your bro?", "It seems like, in all of the bickering between the adults, the kids are being forgotten. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any because uncle didn\u2019t bring any\u201d is all well and good, but the result is that the boys don\u2019t get anything. I\u2019m not going to lay that at your feet, but the whole situation seems messed up.", "Wait... why?", "I could do that, but everyone will see the gifts anyways when I take him back home. And if God forbid my little brother died, that would be the end of my relationship with my stepmother. I'd never visit again. She really was only my stepmother in title only because I moved out my father's house like 2 years into their relationship so I was never really that close with her.", "The stepbrother and nephew are two different people", "I just feel like you\u2019re overlooking the bigger picture here. OP tried their best with this step-nephew (they\u2019re allowed to dictate their relationship and it seems to be on the superficial side) and included him in outings alongside their own little brother. But it seems like his bio dad is taking advantage of the stepmoms courtesy of RAISING HIS OWN SON. \n\nSo you calling OP an A H for not treating him as family when they more or less have is what led me to say you\u2019re the step uncle. When OP did step up but pulled back when everyone is letting the bio dad get away with not fulfilling his own obligation on raising his own damn son.", "NTA", "YTA I don't understand what how much the father makes (but doesn't spend on son) has to do with you being nice to your cousin. You're upset at the adults but you're directing the consequences at the child.", "YTA - this kid likely felt like he had his own relationship with you, and now he finds out that it was just a pity one, and not one you care to continue. My heart hurts for him.", "YTA\n\nThis poor kid has been abandonned by his parents and thought he was loved and wanted by his new family but now suddenly he doesn\u2019t get Xmas presents from a family member while everyone else does. His father being a deadbeat is not his fault. It would\u2019ve been better to buy a dollar store present and explain that money is tight than buy nothing. This is really hurtful to a vulnerable child. You are punishing a child for his father\u2019s behaviour.", "NTA You're not obligated. The kid isn't related to you. But. I think you're focusing too much on the people around him and not enough on the kid himself. Do _you_ like him? Do _you_ enjoy his company when you include him? Is he happy to see you? That's what is important. Your relationship (or lack of; or lack of desire to have on either part) with him. You cannot fix his weird parent dynamic (although stepmom might be able to either legally force her brother to take back his kid or pay child support). You can decide if you want to be someone to this kid so that he keeps you in his life when he's an adult.", "Nope. NTA.  He never gets your brother gifts, he can\u2019t expect you to get anything for his son.   You do you.  And give to only those you wish to.  It was nice of you to include this other kid but not necessary.", "So punish the son because his father is an asshole?", "half-brother and step-brother/step-cousin"]}
