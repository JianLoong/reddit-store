That\u2019s not here nor there. Anyway, it\u2019s her birthday and Iv never been one to make a big deal about birthdays anyway but it is nice to get a text once a year from people. Her brother and mom texted me and we\u2019re all equally as close. Anyway they are having a crab boil and I really don\u2019t want to partake. Not to mention I don\u2019t like feeling like a scavenger. I pay for my things and cook my meals and just feel gross when the only time I really come down is when I need something. I also I don\u2019t feel like making her feel special when she can\u2019t even do something as little as text me. AITA?\n\nEDIT- To add a little bit of context, if it matters, our birthdays are two weeks apart. Sure she could have forgotten but she\u2019s got no job, no kid, not much really going on and in the 12 years Iv been with her sister I think she\u2019s told me happy birthday 2-3 times, but we go through this whole rigamarole every year. Still open to hearing it from yall but wanted to get it on the table.

I doubt she didn't text you to make you not feel special, she probably just forgot yet here you are being weird and petty about it.", "Soft YTA. I just think it\u2019s weird. This is something one would expect a 16 year old girl to whine about, not a 34 year old man.", "YTA - we don't have enough context to know if she's doing it on purpose; we DO know that you are", "YTA, you are being petty. Wish her HB, make a quick appearance and be nice. You are moving soon.", "YTA  \nGet over yourself, you being there is not \"making her feel special\".  It was an invite to a family birthday get-together. You are family, you live there, hence the invite.\n\nYou aren't really into birthdays, the two of you aren't close, then why are you being such a pest about her not texting?   I get along with my BIL just fine, I would not expect him to text me, some years he posts on my social media, some years he doesn't.

Sounds like there are some non-ideal circumstances at play here, and I wish you the best. Considering you keep to yourself, it's reasonable that she neglected to text you on your birthday. For all she knows, you prefer to *not* get a text, right? I recommend trying to shake some of the tension and mustering more warmth for these people. Give her the birthday attention you wish to receive. Maybe your sister-in-law wouldn't be the only one happy you decided to show.", "I think since you're living in the home where the crab boil is taking place (unless I'm reading incorrectly), it will be really obvious that you're snubbing her.

She doesn't make an effort on something I pretend to not care about.\n\nJFC.   If you want people to wish you HBD, make a big deal about it.  Since you don't make a deal about it, she might think you either don't care, or that you actively dislike celebrating.  You are keeping track of when people don't celebrate your birthday, while outwardly showing disinterest in your birthday.  You don't get to have it both ways.", "YTA. You\u2019re a 30-something year old dude. Who cares? Does anyone in their 30s really care that much about birthdays? Because I sure don\u2019t, I\u2019m tired, man, text me a birthday message or not, I\u2019ll forget about it by tomorrow.", "Thanks for the words. It all worked out in the end. My thing was yes, although I don\u2019t make a big deal about my birthday where a simple happy birthday would make my day of which I didn\u2019t get I felt like I was expected to fawn over her. My think was no text message on my birthday I\u2019m totally fine with and wouldn\u2019t care. I only care because I\u2019m expected to care about hers. Does that make sense? It worked out in the end and every one enjoyed each others company. I just cant help but feel a tiny bit slighted that she doesn\u2019t care enough about my birthday when I\u2019m there for hers. I dunno.", "She\u2019s never wished me happy birthday. We\u2019re less than a month apart. 2 weeks actually. And this happens every year.", "Not negating what you said but I should add some context. Our birthdays are less than 2 weeks apart. She doesn\u2019t have a job or a kid or really much going on, not that she couldn\u2019t forget but in the 12 years Iv been with her sister I think she\u2019s wished me happy birthday maybe 2 times?", "True but unless someone comes out and says something nobody knows ones true context", "I get it and that\u2019s probably what I do but even if we\u2019re not living here like years past it\u2019s the same thing. I figured she would this year cuz ya know I live here.", "I don\u2019t outwardly show dis interest. I just act like it\u2019s another day. I don\u2019t ask anyone for anything and that\u2019s totally ok with me. I don\u2019t need any thing nor do I need attention. Is it nice? Absolutely. At the end of the day it\u2019s not about birthdays. It\u2019s about her wanting everyone to fawn over her but not caring enough to extend a simple text to me. I don\u2019t want it both ways at all actually. Don\u2019t text me. That\u2019s fine. Leave me alone when it\u2019s your birthday. Seems even to me. It\u2019s just being kind and a nice thing to do. But I\u2019m expected to extend that kindness out? Why?", "No I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not even about birthdays I don\u2019t care. I also want to be left alone. It\u2019s about her thinking the world revolves around her. If she showed the slightest interest in ANYTHING other than what she has going on. It\u2019s not about birthdays. It about her not caring about other people yet expecting people to care about her. I\u2019d rather be left alone on both days", "So?  Have you talked to her about it?", "Get over it", "That's my point, have you ever heard the saying \"Assume and you make an ass out of u and me\" ?\n\nWe only know what we know, maybe you should just talk to your sister-in-law about this so you at least know if she actually dislikes you or this is just a misunderstanding?", "Then it sounds like you just don\u2019t like her lol. And it sounds like you are wanting to be validated in thinking she\u2019s actually the asshole and not you so that you feel justified in not liking her. It\u2019s okay to not like an in-law, but don\u2019t tip toe around it and make it about wishing you happy birthday.", "lol it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s pretty self centered. My wife didn\u2019t wanna be there either and just wanted to give her, her obligatory present. Her brother didn\u2019t even  come at all. My wife and her got in a bit of a tiff last week because we all do a secret Santa and we all agree on a price and only buy gifts for the person you draw. She always buys stuff for everyone and disregards the SS and makes everyone else feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t really care. I mean it\u2019s usually something I can use but everyone else is trying to save money. Her younger sister has a kid just as well as my wife and I. We don\u2019t have extra money to buy for everyone. It\u2019s just a fun thing to do for one person and everyone is covered. But the rest of us feel bad because we didn\u2019t do the same thing. I dunno. It worked out in the end tonight.", "Anyway thanks for the replies."]}
