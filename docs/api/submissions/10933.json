Your brother is not unaware of his size, and I\u2019m sure he has a keen understanding of the fact that not all furniture can support him. Being in a situation where your size causes you to not be able to sit comfortably is embarrassing and awful, but it is even worse to break someone else\u2019s furniture just by sitting on it. In your brother\u2019s situation, he may gravitate towards larger pieces of furniture because they seem like the most likely to have a high enough weight limit to support him (as well as no armrests to dig into his sides). If you let him know casually that this particular chair is very sturdy and strong, he will hopefully appreciate the heads up and the knowledge he has a safe place to sit.", "NTA. He may not have said anything but I have a hard time believing he broke a *couch* without noticing. Support beams are noisy when they break. It sucks and it's awkward, but a little embarrassment from being told you're afraid he might break yet another couch might be a reality check he needs.

It\u2019s not fair that you had to pay for another couch because he broke it.\n\nI also think it\u2019s weird that he hasn\u2019t said anything about that matter. I would think that he would be aware that he is prone to breaking things due to his weight.", "I actually think this is one of those situations that while very uncomfortable, it is better to be upfront. Tell him as you walk to the loungeroom that the new couch is not sturdy but the armchair should be comfortable for him. Just say it breezily and move on to the next topic. He knows he is big and furniture is iffy with his weight. If he is not a jerk, he will not want to break your furniture and be okay with the heads up if you don't make it awkward or mean.
