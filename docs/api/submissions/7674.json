He is retired navy but was in till I was in college. He deployed a lot when I was growing up, and when he came home he never got out of military mode, his catchphrase might as well have been \"stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about\" or \"If someone under my command did this kind of job\u2026\". My parents divorced when I was in grad school, and he was going through a manic episode, so it was put on me (yes I know not my responsibility as their kid) to drive home any time he would do something dangerous to check up. I have always resented him for this and how he treated me growing up, but I come crawling any time he offers to hang out, because I still want daddy\u2019s approval, but working with a therapist on all that stuff.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e (36F) and I (32M) are getting married soon, and I asked my dad if he wanted to wear the same tux the father of the bride would be wearing and he agreed. I put him on the group and told him to go get fitted and we would be good to go.\n\nThat was in October, jump to last week and I am getting fitted for my tux because I am a huge procrastinator, and they tell me oh hey one person in your group hasn't been fitted yet, guess who it is. So I text my dad \"go get fitted for your tux.... the group number is XXXXXX\", he responds with \"who do you think you are talking to\". I rephrased i as hey would you mind getting fitted please, they ask for 60 days and we are getting close to that date, I would really appreciate it, please and thanks. To which he responds \"nothing new in the text, you need to know who you are talking to\". I am not proud of my response to this, it was definitely childish, but I had it. I essentially told him in more words that I thought I was talking to an adult, an equal, maybe a friend, but that he was more pre-occupied with exerting power over others than trying not to be an a\\*\\*hole. He responds with just \"i'm out\" I say ok that is fine, I'll take you off the tux group, just please RSVP so we know what meals you and your wife want, he just reponds \"out\".\n\nHe proceeds to RSVP to the wedding with No for himself and his wife, BUT THEN all of my uncles on his side change their RSVPs to no. I ask around and come to find out he called them all up and told the uncles if they went to my wedding they would be disrespecting him, I tried to tell the uncles whatever blow up he and I were having I hoped they could at least come to the wedding to support their nephew on his big day. They all ghosted me.\n\nTalking to my fiancee she says I need to be open to the possibility of him apologizing and letting him change his RSVP and attend the wedding if he does apologize. So here it comes, AITA because I told my fiancee under no circumstance would any of the uncles or my dad be allowed to come to the wedding as they have hurt me too much for this, and that there is no going back from this", "created_utc": 1674068641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ffmud/aita_for_saying_my_dad_cant_come_to_my_wedding/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps you should inform the venue as well in case they try to show up.", "From a eight year army vet. NTA. Your dads is a tool and can't function outside of the mentality of the military when it comes to social cues and relations. Its not uncommon, I know people I was in with who are the same way. To the point their kids refuse to talk with them as well. \n\nMy opinion? Stick to your decision. He doesn't get to dictate how you handle this wedding and interactions with you. You and your fiancee do. Your uncles falling in line with him just showed how they cant think for themselves.", "NTA who does he think he\u2019s taking to? Because you aren\u2019t a soldier and his whole military attitude should\u2019ve stopped as he left the base. Military is the way it is for war - your home and family aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t a combat zone and his attitude needed to adjust to that. I wouldn\u2019t have him about either. He can be a control freak somewhere alone.\n\nNo you don\u2019t need to be open to an apologize. You\u2019re an adult and he\u2019s treating you like a peon. What about his constant disrespect to you? Don\u2019t put up with that.", "NTA - Your dad is an AH for not respecting you as an adult and an even bigger one for pulling other family members into your disagreement with him. That's purely ego driven. You may want to consider how he'll act if he does actually attend the wedding, he may cause drama on your special day and I'm sure you don't want that.\n\nAs someone with a father like this, I'm sorry you have such a dud for a dad.", "Your father said he was \"out.\" Hold him to it or you'll be dealing with his disrespect for the rest of your life. If he ever wants back \"in,\" he needs to write a letter of apology to you and your bride for his immaturity and for turning his brothers against you. (As to your uncles, they're all strangers to you now and good riddance.)\n\nYou have both my sympathy and my empathy. But you're too important to deal with this kind of abuse from your family. \n\nNTA.", "Ask your uncles why they are so easily bullied by him. Nta. He's being a major one though, if anyone is being disrespectful, it's him towards you.", "NTA.  Nothing nice to say about your Dad or all his brother's backing him up shitty behaviour.\n\nIt doesn't sound like he's changed and worst, he took all the spineless uncles with him this time, so even keeping the door open for an apology seems not only pointless but also capitulating to potentially being a door mat.  I wouldn't want someone like that at my wedding personally and I don't blame you for drawing a line under the whole thing.", "NTA. What an ego. My dad did the exact same shit and I didn't speak to him for 5 years before he died, and I still don't regret it. If it's more important for him to act like a self-important fool than to be at his kid's wedding then f\\*ck him", "NTA. They RSVP'd no, so take them at their word.", "NTA - Cut and run", "Nta with good reason", "NTA. I totally agree that he doesn\u2019t belong and if it were me, I would absolutely never speak to or have anything to do with him or your uncles ever again. I just wish your fianc\u00e9 would respect your hurt and anger over this. This is NOT the time to try and extend forgiveness at all. He\u2019s a sick and unredeemable monster who not only crossed the line with you, but he poisoned your relationship with your uncles. If there is a hell, he just RSVP\u2019d the devil\u2019s invitation. This will be is one party he won\u2019t be able to back out of. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, but I wish you the best! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA - your dad has issues - he doesn't want to come and thinks he is going to ruin your wedding by having his brothers not show up.  Fuck him", "NTA good riddance, you really don\u2019t need that kind of people in your life. I hope your wedding and continued therapy go well.", "NTA. Your father decided to let his petty INSECURITIES get in the way of supporting you and being part of your wedding day. I'm not a fan of \"it's my special day so do what I say even if it is ridiculous\". Then he spread his venom to the rest of the family. Because he a world class jerk.\n\nIn fact, as groom you are kind of his superior in this situation. So he is wrong. He should know who he is talking to.\n\nDo you think your father will apologize? If so, too late to be fitted by the tux.\n\nIf your fiancee is worried how this will look at, have her just tell people that your family has times they get along and times that they don't. Have her leave it at that. If someone really presses the next response is: \"did you ever see the Great Santini with Robert Duvall? It's like that.\"", "You gave lots of notice about the tux, you reminded him again, and then set him straight finally that he needs to treat you like an adult when speaking to you.  He got pissed and retaliated.   Let him suffer for it certainly but if he does come grovelling back and you say no then that is probably the end of your relationship with him.   If you\u2019re ok with that then NTA.", "NTA - \n\n> who do you think you\u2019re talking to\n\nWho does he think *he* is is the better question. Sounds like someone who can\u2019t separate military and personal life and thinks he\u2019s some sort of 5 star general of your family. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. Your father (and his brothers) have chosen their side. It sounds like your dad has some major issues that he needs to work through\u2026but that\u2019s no longer your priority. Prioritize your wife, have an amazing wedding day/honeymoon and look forward to your new life with your spouse. \n\nIf your dad can\u2019t take a simple request without blowing up, that doesn\u2019t sound like someone who is worth keeping around in your life. You aren\u2019t under his command and he\u2019s not your commanding officer. Sounds like your mom already figured this one out too.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad has abused you since you were a child. In fact, he still treats you horribly. A parent-child relationship shouldn't be one where the child fears their fucking parent.\n\nI got a suggestion for you: keeping this person in your life will only bring you more drama down the line. How about you go no contact with him, just like how your equally bad uncles did?", " You are NTA. Let me say that again loudly and for the for the people in the back\u2026. You are not the asshole!!! \n\nThis is a chain of command power play.\n\nCall their bluff.", "NTA. Your fiance\u00e9's take is somewhat understandable from the perspective that she doesn't want to be responsible for causing a breach between you & some of your family, but she doesn't seem to understand that the situation doesn't actually have anything at all to do with her. It's the natural conclusion to a lifetime of your dad's authoritarian bullying, & you're not an asshole for finally saying you've had enough of that crap.", "NTA. He is making the choice to not be a part of your special day. He has clearly lost touch with reality if he thinks he is your superior and you must address him as if you are in the service and he out ranks you. You are his child and from the sounds of it he has never shown you that he respects you in the slightest.", "This is so sad. I'm so sorry, OP. I say this as a mil brat myself, and as someone who has been a mil wife. You're not one of his \"command\". This is the civilian world, and he can not bark orders to others while expecting to be obeyed under penalty of UCMJ.\n\nYou're NTA.  Your dad and uncles, however,  are. Stand your ground. You're an adult, and YOU deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.", "Nta he made his bed and now he needs to lay in it", "NTA - blood doesn't necessarily make you care about each other. You have every right to make this the line in the sand. \n\nI do urge you to give some thought to how the future looks if this ends your relationship with him (and maybe your uncles). If you are okay with that, and no one would blame you, do what is best for your mental health.", "INFO: If your uncles came to you today and said they changed their mind, and they are sorry they let your Dad influence them on this, they really don't want to miss your big day regardless of whether your Father comes or not, would you change your mind?", "NTA. you are entitled to invite whoever u want to your wedding and you only have to justify to you and your fiance why you might not invite them. \n\nbut you should also consider your fiancee's thoughts on the possibility of contrition and forgiveness. life's too short to hold onto that kind of hate. going no contact and putting the ball in their court to apologize first would probably allow you to enjoy your wedding with no regrets on your part.", "nta", "NTA in any sense of the word. Your father is a child, as are his brothers. Just because someone is family does not mean they need to be in our lives.", "NTA. I would block him and just move on with my life.  Same goes for the uncles.\n\nOP shouldn't have to deal with such childish toxicity.", "I commend you on your wonderfully shiny spine.\n\nHow you came to be such a level headed individual with such a father and uncles is a marvel in itself. \n\nNTA at all. Enjoy your wedding in the safe and certain knowledge that everyone there will be there because they think the world of you and your partner.\n\nYour father and uncles have just confirmed to you exactly who they are but I'm sure you needed no reminding. \n\nGood luck to you and your soon-to-be wife.", "I think you and your dad have issues that can't be solved by a surface level he bad I'm good style reddit post and its much deeper then whos the asshole here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
