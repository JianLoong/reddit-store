He is retired navy but was in till I was in college. He deployed a lot when I was growing up, and when he came home he never got out of military mode, his catchphrase might as well have been \"stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about\" or \"If someone under my command did this kind of job\u2026\". My parents divorced when I was in grad school, and he was going through a manic episode, so it was put on me (yes I know not my responsibility as their kid) to drive home any time he would do something dangerous to check up. I have always resented him for this and how he treated me growing up, but I come crawling any time he offers to hang out, because I still want daddy\u2019s approval, but working with a therapist on all that stuff.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e (36F) and I (32M) are getting married soon, and I asked my dad if he wanted to wear the same tux the father of the bride would be wearing and he agreed. I put him on the group and told him to go get fitted and we would be good to go.\n\nThat was in October, jump to last week and I am getting fitted for my tux because I am a huge procrastinator, and they tell me oh hey one person in your group hasn't been fitted yet, guess who it is. So I text my dad \"go get fitted for your tux.... the group number is XXXXXX\", he responds with \"who do you think you are talking to\". I rephrased i as hey would you mind getting fitted please, they ask for 60 days and we are getting close to that date, I would really appreciate it, please and thanks. To which he responds \"nothing new in the text, you need to know who you are talking to\". I am not proud of my response to this, it was definitely childish, but I had it. I essentially told him in more words that I thought I was talking to an adult, an equal, maybe a friend, but that he was more pre-occupied with exerting power over others than trying not to be an a\\*\\*hole. He responds with just \"i'm out\" I say ok that is fine, I'll take you off the tux group, just please RSVP so we know what meals you and your wife want, he just reponds \"out\".\n\nHe proceeds to RSVP to the wedding with No for himself and his wife, BUT THEN all of my uncles on his side change their RSVPs to no. I ask around and come to find out he called them all up and told the uncles if they went to my wedding they would be disrespecting him, I tried to tell the uncles whatever blow up he and I were having I hoped they could at least come to the wedding to support their nephew on his big day. They all ghosted me.\n\nTalking to my fiancee she says I need to be open to the possibility of him apologizing and letting him change his RSVP and attend the wedding if he does apologize. So here it comes, AITA because I told my fiancee under no circumstance would any of the uncles or my dad be allowed to come to the wedding as they have hurt me too much for this, and that there is no going back from this", "created_utc": 1674068641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ffmud/aita_for_saying_my_dad_cant_come_to_my_wedding/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To the point their kids refuse to talk with them as well. \n\nMy opinion? Stick to your decision. He doesn't get to dictate how you handle this wedding and interactions with you. You and your fiancee do. Your uncles falling in line with him just showed how they cant think for themselves.", "NTA who does he think he\u2019s taking to? Because you aren\u2019t a soldier and his whole military attitude should\u2019ve stopped as he left the base. Military is the way it is for war - your home and family aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t a combat zone and his attitude needed to adjust to that. I wouldn\u2019t have him about either. He can be a control freak somewhere alone.\n\nNo you don\u2019t need to be open to an apologize. You\u2019re an adult and he\u2019s treating you like a peon.

Your father decided to let his petty INSECURITIES get in the way of supporting you and being part of your wedding day. I'm not a fan of \"it's my special day so do what I say even if it is ridiculous\". Then he spread his venom to the rest of the family. Because he a world class jerk.\n\nIn fact, as groom you are kind of his superior in this situation. So he is wrong. He should know who he is talking to.\n\nDo you think your father will apologize? If so, too late to be fitted by the tux.\n\nIf your fiancee is worried how this will look at, have her just tell people that your family has times they get along and times that they don't.

Your father (and his brothers) have chosen their side. It sounds like your dad has some major issues that he needs to work through\u2026but that\u2019s no longer your priority. Prioritize your wife, have an amazing wedding day/honeymoon and look forward to your new life with your spouse. \n\nIf your dad can\u2019t take a simple request without blowing up, that doesn\u2019t sound like someone who is worth keeping around in your life. You aren\u2019t under his command and he\u2019s not your commanding officer. Sounds like your mom already figured this one out too.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad has abused you since you were a child.

Your fiance\u00e9's take is somewhat understandable from the perspective that she doesn't want to be responsible for causing a breach between you & some of your family, but she doesn't seem to understand that the situation doesn't actually have anything at all to do with her. It's the natural conclusion to a lifetime of your dad's authoritarian bullying, & you're not an asshole for finally saying you've had enough of that crap.", "NTA. He is making the choice to not be a part of your special day. He has clearly lost touch with reality if he thinks he is your superior and you must address him as if you are in the service and he out ranks you.

I say this as a mil brat myself, and as someone who has been a mil wife. You're not one of his \"command\".

You have every right to make this the line in the sand. \n\nI do urge you to give some thought to how the future looks if this ends your relationship with him (and maybe your uncles). If you are okay with that, and no one would blame you, do what is best for your mental health.", "INFO: If your uncles came to you today and said they changed their mind, and they are sorry they let your Dad influence them on this, they really don't want to miss your big day regardless of whether your Father comes or not, would you change your mind?", "NTA. you are entitled to invite whoever u want to your wedding and you only have to justify to you and your fiance why you might not invite them. \n\nbut you should also consider your fiancee's thoughts on the possibility of contrition and forgiveness. life's too short to hold onto that kind of hate. going no contact and putting the ball in their court to apologize first would probably allow you to enjoy your wedding with no regrets on your part.", "nta", "NTA in any sense of the word.

Ghost the lot of them as they are exerting childish power plays that you should not acknowledge.", "NTA!!\nYour father behaves like a tyrant and your uncles are shining examples of what it looks like when you give in to the whims of a family tyrant.  I'm a therapist and work with tons of folks like your uncles who have been conditioned to appease the family tyrant because of the level of hell these folks can create when they aren't appeased.  They often say things like \"I'm just keeping the peace\" or \"I'm staying out of it\" wholly oblivious to the devastation they are enabling and all of the folks sacrificed as collateral damage.\nFor this reason, I have different thoughts about dealing with your dad versus your uncles.  Let me be abundantly clear!!  You are absolutely NOT the asshole even if you keep this boundary with your uncles!!  You are allowed to protect yourself from people who allow you to be the collateral damage of their own woundedness and fear!!  There is never any shame in doing so!!  With that said, if one of your uncles has the insight and the spine to come to you and say \"I am really sorry!  I am so used to cowing to your dad and I really screwed you over by just automatically doing so in this situation.  I want to support you and fuck how your dad feels about it.\", you may want to reconsidering letting him stay in your life and come to your wedding.  Sadly, I wouldn't count on any of them doing that...but if they do, really consider what you want long term rather than acting only in response to your present hurt.\n\nAs for your father.  I really really hope you do not relent.  The ONLY chance you have of having a semblance of a tolerable relationship with him in the future is if you make it unflinchingly clear that you WILL NOT be in relationship with the \"tyrant\" and your wedding is the PERFECT place to make that stand.\n\nAs for your WTB, be patient with her but don't back down.  It's really hard for folks that were raised in good enough families to truly grasp the destruction that poor parenting does to people.  Even if she understands it on the surface, she doesn't really comprehend it.  This is why you need to be patient but you need to be persistent because she needs to eventually understand the damage your father has done to you and more importantly, the power he has to continue that damage if she's going to be your partner in protecting you from him.  Here's a hint: if she's a good choice, with the capacity to be the partner you need, show her your hurt and your pain more than your anger.  Women are condition to \"settle\", \"soothe\", and manage men's anger and often try to do so by minimizing the source of the anger.  She will not respond similarly to your hurt and it will help her understand.", "NTA. I think it's time to cut him off for good. And your uncles. Sorry about this.

You're 100% right, from the stories I've heard my grandmother was the original tyrant and my dad just kind of stepped into her place when she was gone. He's not the biggest, nor probably the strongest at this point, but he is definitely the most vocal.

You asked for a VERY reasonable request, and he turned it into a power trip as you rightly noted. Your father is DEFINITELY the AH for getting his brothers involved in this.
