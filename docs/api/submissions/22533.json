I had previously met the couple (M&F 28) a few times & they seemed fine.\nI brought a pack of 5mg gummies that I would take during the reception & my roomie knew I was bringing them. The wedding was small, about 60 ppl. I knew going in that not everyone was allowed plus 1s, but my roomie was as she\u2019s in the bridal party.\nThe ceremony was nice & when we moved to the reception, I was seated with 3 bridesmaids & 2 of the bride\u2019s college friends (20s MF couple). The wedding party left for pics and some food was brought out, so I took a gummy. I offered some to the couple I was left with, & they politely declined, & I thought that was the end of that.\nSome time passed & the wedding party returned. Right away, the couple engaged in hushed conversation with the bridesmaid sitting opposite me. I couldn\u2019t hear over the music. The couple\u2019s vibe changed & while we were talking as a table they would start responding to things I was saying with \u201coh, I wonder what other fun things you\u2019re taking\u201d & \u201cdon\u2019t let the kids here see you\u2019re doing that\u201d in snarky-ish tones. I became uncomfortable, so I excused myself & stepped out onto the patio.\nSoon after my roomie stepped out & joined me. She informed me that the table started talking about me when I left, and the couple was appalled to find out I brought gummies to the reception. They expressed their distaste for drugs that aren\u2019t \u201cFDA approved\u201d & are also apparently christian, which became clear when they stated that \u201cthis was a Christian wedding & [I] should be more respectful in not bringing \u2018addictive drugs\u2019 around a celebration with kids present\u201d. My roomie thought they were overreacting, but the other bridesmaids agreed with them & debated kicking me out.\nI was embarrassed & didn\u2019t realize I would cause such a reaction, as they had an open bar & plenty of the people were already buzzed, that couple included. We returned & I apologized, and tried to explain that the gummies are legal, & not addictive like alcohol or other drugs. The man seemed to think that was a jab at him, as he was already pretty drunk. He interrupted me & said \u201cyou don\u2019t get to tell others how much they can drink at a wedding, especially when you\u2019re a plus 1 & we were actually invited.\u201d \nThe convo died, & we were dismissed for dinner. I could hear that couple a few people behind us in line for the buffet still talking about it & including others in the convo. At that point I felt unwelcome and told my roomie I was just going to wait in the car outside. She opposed that, but I told her I\u2019d be fine and left.\nI stayed in the car for 3 hours. When my roomie finally came she told me that when the bride heard about this, she didn\u2019t personally care, but said I absolutely shouldn\u2019t have brought edibles, as many of the attendees were christians and equated weed to meth or cocaine", "created_utc": 1689649860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152mlnm/aita_for_taking_a_thc_gummy_at_a_christian_wedding/", "score": 53, "replies": ["I'm gonna say ESH. They need to chill out especially if you aren't making a scene but you shouldn't offer random people you don't know THC at a wedding.", "ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s ok you took 5mg thc.  No worse than being drunk or buzzed.  But you failed to gauge your audience and randomly offering other people gummies.  Should have kept it to yourself.  There\u2019s still quite a social stigma. And a wedding is not the place to try to tear down those barriers if you\u2019re not the bride or groom. \n\nAnd everyone else decided to judge you harshly for a benign drug that\u2019s legal as alcohol.  And no worse than alcohol.", "Not the ah for bringing it or taljng it.\n\nKinda YTA for offering it to people you don't know. Never assume someone's ok with it.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, but as someone who partakes daily, I would NEVER offer anything to a bunch of strangers let alone do it in front of them, regardless of the method. Be a little more discreet next time and excuse yourself to do what you need to come back a little more relaxed.", "As someone who smokes heavily and does edibles occasionally, YTA. You barely know these people and you\u2019re a plus one, why would you bring gummies to eat *at* the event, and then offer them to strangers around you? If you\u2019re gonna be taking that stuff, you do it before you go or when you\u2019re alone. Or, if you barely know these people, don\u2019t take them at all. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s legal. If someone had an alcohol-free wedding, you\u2019d be just as much an AH for bringing alcohol to drink and offer to others. While yeah, I do think they overreacted a bit, bringing the gummies to the wedding with you was unnecessary.", "ESH. They were definitely overreacting but why would you offer the gummies to random people at the wedding? It's like you were trying to draw attention to yourself on purpose. \n\n5mg won't even get most people high so it's not like it's a huge deal. But just keep it to yourself.", "YTA for not being discreet about it.", "NTA especially in a legal state/country.\n\nBUT at a situation like a wedding, you gotta read the room. Popping the gummy is fine, definitely makes the reception better, but for the love of God don\u2019t offer one to some rando. People have strong (read: misguided) opinions on weed, and sometimes it\u2019s just better to keep that on the DL.", "YTA for being indiscreet at someone else's event.  What made you think it was appropriate to advertise your consumption and then offer gummies to strangers....at a wedding where you were not even close to the couple but a guest of one of the wedding party?", "Lots of people in the comments should be eating some gummies right now", "YTA.  Unless the couple getting married openly encourages it at the wedding itself, you don\u2019t bring drugs to a wedding.  Offering to share only increased the level of inappropriateness.  Doing it when you\u2019re a plus one and have hardly met the couple is in especially poor taste, because you don\u2019t even know the couple well enough to know whether they\u2019d be comfortable around edibles at all, much less comfortable having them at their wedding.", "So there probably wouldn\u2019t have been a problem in just taking a gummie and going on about your night, the problem is, you offered them around in company you didn\u2019t know. Legalization of weed is so new that you have to know that not everyone is on board with it. Offering it to people you didn\u2019t know at the table was kinda trashy, almost like showing up with your own booze and drinking from your purse. YTA", "I am Christian but I could care less. But you should consider that crowd if there is children around. Also don't share that information with just anybody cuz you never know how they're going to respond.", "NTA. The assholes were DRUNK. WTF is the difference?  There are a lot of Christians that would judge them harshly for drinking.", "NTA. 5 mg is nothing compared to how drunk some of those people probably were. Perhaps just be more discreet?", "Typical Christian hypocrisy. Legal edibles are horrible but the open bar is not. NTA", "What does being Christian have to do with being anti-weed?", "Alcohol at a Christian wedding lol.. yeah ok .. what hypocrites", "Weed is cool and God isn't real. NTA", "  NTA - just don\u2019t offer to share next time.", "Seriously, NTA.\n\nThough maybe be a little more careful who you offer them to. Not that there's anything wrong with taking them in the slightest, the people you talked to clearly know nothing about them, but just to avoid this sort of thing. If you didn't say anything, they would have just thought you ate a piece of candy and no more would have occurred.", "NTA\u2026. But some of these anti-weed commenters are lol..   I can hardly believe how effin stupid people can be about cannabis in 2023, modern day reefer madness jackasses.  The reaction when you try to educate is telling.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to discreetly take cannabis any more than a stick of gum.  I will step outside to smoke, but edis are definitely nunya.  (Unless you\u2019re out of control but then that\u2019s what makes you an ah.)  \n\nAnd some of these lames said you\u2019re ta because you offered to share!??  You would have been if you HADNT offered lolol, so good work- definitely NTA!", "NTA at all, especially somewhere legal.", "NTA. They\u2019re hypocrites. Next time keep your treats to yourself.", "Just don\u2019t offer. Say they are throat lozenges!", "NTA but maybe don\u2019t offer to strangers next time.", "Woah don\u2019t offer strangers edibles my dude. YTA", "YTA. Don\u2019t take drugs at peoples weddings. \n\nDid not have typing that on my bingo card for the day.", "There is a story in the Bible about Jesus at a wedding. The wedding had been going on for a while, and the fun was starting to wear off. Jesus\u2019s mom comes and tells him that the vibe is whack, and is there anything he can do about it. Jesus ponders the situation for a moment, then he sends his mom to the marketplace to purchase and return with all the Haribo she could find. She returns with several clay pots of the sweet goodies. He tells Mary to try one. She\u2019s all, \u201cWhat?  Why am I eating gummy bears?\u201d And Jesus is all \u201cWait a minute.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how Jesus saved the day.", "NTA. Typical hypocrite bible thumpers. Don\u2019t get me wrong. God and i have a good working relationship. He knows i don\u2019t care for his typical representation.", "YTA. How tacky.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and weren\u2019t being disrespectful or disruptive. However, offering weed to the other guest was maybe not a good move. But you didn\u2019t know and you were trying to be nice. I don\u2019t think your the AH, weed helps calm my nerves and being in a place where you don\u2019t know people can be very stressful. So I completely understand it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA especially in a legal state. These people need to get over themselves, it\u2019s legal in half the country. And alcohol was being served, so it\u2019s not like it was a straight-edge wedding. \n\nYou sound nice and fun. They were super rude to make you feel unwelcome.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s legal, you weren\u2019t acting disruptive. I don\u2019t see what relevance kids have either. How would they know about the gummies? It\u2019s not like smoking at a wedding around guests, which would definitely be inappropriate. It also doesn\u2019t sound like you told others how to drink. You made a valid point that alcohol is often more addictive and harmful than THC. I also don\u2019t understand what being Christian has to do with it, as I know many Christian\u2019s who recognize the medicinal benefits of THC or even use it themselves.", "NTA. More people die from drunk driving everyday than weed will ever.", "NTA! If it\u2019s legal in your state/country go for it! It\u2019s no different than having a couple shots before the wedding. \n\nI got high at a catholic wedding a few months ago and had THE BEST TIME! I went without my hubby and cried my eyes out at the ceremony and then had a blast at the reception. Made me so much less anxious about being around people.", "NTA, but you could\u2019ve sussed out their opinions first, fairly easily & quickly before getting into this situation!", "NTA and alcohol is worse than weed", "YTA.  Don't do drugs at a wedding, Christian or not.  You wouldn't bring your own sandwich or sneak in a bottle of Jack Daniels, why would it be ok to bring edibles?", "NTA but pretty stupid. Never ever offer weed to strangers. It\u2019s still pretty taboo - while it\u2019s ridiculous it\u2019s the truth. Should\u2019ve taken them in the bathroom or discreetly and kept to yourself.", "YTA for going to a Christian wedding", "Yeah, YTA. Seriously. I would be pissed if someone was doing and offering people drugs at my wedding. Even if it's weed. What is wrong with you? And in the shape of candy around kids? \n\nI'm sorry, but this really wasn't the place or time to take drugs. What if you got a bad trip? What if you forgot to hide your shit away in your pocket and a kid got ahold of them? \nIt may be a low dose for an adult, but a child can react very differently.", "I suppose it\u2019s wrong that the title just made me bust out laughing. I think the \u201cChristian\u201d just tickled me. \n\nAs a Universal Life Minister, courtesy of the Internet, I condone this activity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
