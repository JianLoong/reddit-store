I had previously met the couple (M&F 28) a few times & they seemed fine.\nI brought a pack of 5mg gummies that I would take during the reception & my roomie knew I was bringing them. The wedding was small, about 60 ppl. I knew going in that not everyone was allowed plus 1s, but my roomie was as she\u2019s in the bridal party.\nThe ceremony was nice & when we moved to the reception, I was seated with 3 bridesmaids & 2 of the bride\u2019s college friends (20s MF couple). The wedding party left for pics and some food was brought out, so I took a gummy. I offered some to the couple I was left with, & they politely declined, & I thought that was the end of that.\nSome time passed & the wedding party returned. Right away, the couple engaged in hushed conversation with the bridesmaid sitting opposite me. I couldn\u2019t hear over the music. The couple\u2019s vibe changed & while we were talking as a table they would start responding to things I was saying with \u201coh, I wonder what other fun things you\u2019re taking\u201d & \u201cdon\u2019t let the kids here see you\u2019re doing that\u201d in snarky-ish tones. I became uncomfortable, so I excused myself & stepped out onto the patio.\nSoon after my roomie stepped out & joined me. She informed me that the table started talking about me when I left, and the couple was appalled to find out I brought gummies to the reception. They expressed their distaste for drugs that aren\u2019t \u201cFDA approved\u201d & are also apparently christian, which became clear when they stated that \u201cthis was a Christian wedding & [I] should be more respectful in not bringing \u2018addictive drugs\u2019 around a celebration with kids present\u201d. My roomie thought they were overreacting, but the other bridesmaids agreed with them & debated kicking me out.\nI was embarrassed & didn\u2019t realize I would cause such a reaction, as they had an open bar & plenty of the people were already buzzed, that couple included. We returned & I apologized, and tried to explain that the gummies are legal, & not addictive like alcohol or other drugs. The man seemed to think that was a jab at him, as he was already pretty drunk. He interrupted me & said \u201cyou don\u2019t get to tell others how much they can drink at a wedding, especially when you\u2019re a plus 1 & we were actually invited.\u201d \nThe convo died, & we were dismissed for dinner. I could hear that couple a few people behind us in line for the buffet still talking about it & including others in the convo. At that point I felt unwelcome and told my roomie I was just going to wait in the car outside. She opposed that, but I told her I\u2019d be fine and left.\nI stayed in the car for 3 hours. When my roomie finally came she told me that when the bride heard about this, she didn\u2019t personally care, but said I absolutely shouldn\u2019t have brought edibles, as many of the attendees were christians and equated weed to meth or cocaine", "created_utc": 1689649860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152mlnm/aita_for_taking_a_thc_gummy_at_a_christian_wedding/", "score": 894, "replies": ["I'm gonna say ESH. They need to chill out especially if you aren't making a scene but you shouldn't offer random people you don't know THC at a wedding.", "ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s ok you took 5mg thc.  No worse than being drunk or buzzed.  But you failed to gauge your audience and randomly offering other people gummies.  Should have kept it to yourself.  There\u2019s still quite a social stigma. And a wedding is not the place to try to tear down those barriers if you\u2019re not the bride or groom. \n\nAnd everyone else decided to judge you harshly for a benign drug that\u2019s legal as alcohol.  And no worse than alcohol.", "Not the ah for bringing it or taljng it.\n\nKinda YTA for offering it to people you don't know. Never assume someone's ok with it.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, but as someone who partakes daily, I would NEVER offer anything to a bunch of strangers let alone do it in front of them, regardless of the method. Be a little more discreet next time and excuse yourself to do what you need to come back a little more relaxed.", "As someone who smokes heavily and does edibles occasionally, YTA. You barely know these people and you\u2019re a plus one, why would you bring gummies to eat *at* the event, and then offer them to strangers around you? If you\u2019re gonna be taking that stuff, you do it before you go or when you\u2019re alone. Or, if you barely know these people, don\u2019t take them at all. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s legal. If someone had an alcohol-free wedding, you\u2019d be just as much an AH for bringing alcohol to drink and offer to others. While yeah, I do think they overreacted a bit, bringing the gummies to the wedding with you was unnecessary.", "ESH. They were definitely overreacting but why would you offer the gummies to random people at the wedding? It's like you were trying to draw attention to yourself on purpose. \n\n5mg won't even get most people high so it's not like it's a huge deal. But just keep it to yourself.", "YTA for not being discreet about it.", "NTA especially in a legal state/country.\n\nBUT at a situation like a wedding, you gotta read the room. Popping the gummy is fine, definitely makes the reception better, but for the love of God don\u2019t offer one to some rando. People have strong (read: misguided) opinions on weed, and sometimes it\u2019s just better to keep that on the DL.", "YTA for being indiscreet at someone else's event.  What made you think it was appropriate to advertise your consumption and then offer gummies to strangers....at a wedding where you were not even close to the couple but a guest of one of the wedding party?", "Lots of people in the comments should be eating some gummies right now", "YTA.  Unless the couple getting married openly encourages it at the wedding itself, you don\u2019t bring drugs to a wedding.  Offering to share only increased the level of inappropriateness.  Doing it when you\u2019re a plus one and have hardly met the couple is in especially poor taste, because you don\u2019t even know the couple well enough to know whether they\u2019d be comfortable around edibles at all, much less comfortable having them at their wedding.", "So there probably wouldn\u2019t have been a problem in just taking a gummie and going on about your night, the problem is, you offered them around in company you didn\u2019t know. Legalization of weed is so new that you have to know that not everyone is on board with it. Offering it to people you didn\u2019t know at the table was kinda trashy, almost like showing up with your own booze and drinking from your purse. YTA", "I am Christian but I could care less. But you should consider that crowd if there is children around. Also don't share that information with just anybody cuz you never know how they're going to respond.", "NTA. The assholes were DRUNK. WTF is the difference?  There are a lot of Christians that would judge them harshly for drinking.", "NTA. 5 mg is nothing compared to how drunk some of those people probably were. Perhaps just be more discreet?", "Typical Christian hypocrisy. Legal edibles are horrible but the open bar is not. NTA", "What does being Christian have to do with being anti-weed?", "Alcohol at a Christian wedding lol.. yeah ok .. what hypocrites", "Weed is cool and God isn't real. NTA", "  NTA - just don\u2019t offer to share next time.", "Seriously, NTA.\n\nThough maybe be a little more careful who you offer them to. Not that there's anything wrong with taking them in the slightest, the people you talked to clearly know nothing about them, but just to avoid this sort of thing. If you didn't say anything, they would have just thought you ate a piece of candy and no more would have occurred.", "NTA\u2026. But some of these anti-weed commenters are lol..   I can hardly believe how effin stupid people can be about cannabis in 2023, modern day reefer madness jackasses.  The reaction when you try to educate is telling.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to discreetly take cannabis any more than a stick of gum.  I will step outside to smoke, but edis are definitely nunya.

Don\u2019t take drugs at peoples weddings. \n\nDid not have typing that on my bingo card for the day.", "There is a story in the Bible about Jesus at a wedding. The wedding had been going on for a while, and the fun was starting to wear off. Jesus\u2019s mom comes and tells him that the vibe is whack, and is there anything he can do about it. Jesus ponders the situation for a moment, then he sends his mom to the marketplace to purchase and return with all the Haribo she could find. She returns with several clay pots of the sweet goodies. He tells Mary to try one. She\u2019s all, \u201cWhat?  Why am I eating gummy bears?\u201d And Jesus is all \u201cWait a minute.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how Jesus saved the day.", "NTA. Typical hypocrite bible thumpers. Don\u2019t get me wrong. God and i have a good working relationship. He knows i don\u2019t care for his typical representation.", "YTA. How tacky.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and weren\u2019t being disrespectful or disruptive. However, offering weed to the other guest was maybe not a good move. But you didn\u2019t know and you were trying to be nice. I don\u2019t think your the AH, weed helps calm my nerves and being in a place where you don\u2019t know people can be very stressful. So I completely understand it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA especially in a legal state. These people need to get over themselves, it\u2019s legal in half the country. And alcohol was being served, so it\u2019s not like it was a straight-edge wedding. \n\nYou sound nice and fun. They were super rude to make you feel unwelcome.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s legal, you weren\u2019t acting disruptive. I don\u2019t see what relevance kids have either. How would they know about the gummies? It\u2019s not like smoking at a wedding around guests, which would definitely be inappropriate. It also doesn\u2019t sound like you told others how to drink. You made a valid point that alcohol is often more addictive and harmful than THC. I also don\u2019t understand what being Christian has to do with it, as I know many Christian\u2019s who recognize the medicinal benefits of THC or even use it themselves.", "NTA. More people die from drunk driving everyday than weed will ever.", "NTA! If it\u2019s legal in your state/country go for it! It\u2019s no different than having a couple shots before the wedding. \n\nI got high at a catholic wedding a few months ago and had THE BEST TIME! I went without my hubby and cried my eyes out at the ceremony and then had a blast at the reception. Made me so much less anxious about being around people.", "NTA, but you could\u2019ve sussed out their opinions first, fairly easily & quickly before getting into this situation!", "NTA and alcohol is worse than weed", "YTA.  Don't do drugs at a wedding, Christian or not.  You wouldn't bring your own sandwich or sneak in a bottle of Jack Daniels, why would it be ok to bring edibles?", "NTA but pretty stupid. Never ever offer weed to strangers. It\u2019s still pretty taboo - while it\u2019s ridiculous it\u2019s the truth. Should\u2019ve taken them in the bathroom or discreetly and kept to yourself.", "YTA for going to a Christian wedding", "Yeah, YTA. Seriously. I would be pissed if someone was doing and offering people drugs at my wedding. Even if it's weed. What is wrong with you? And in the shape of candy around kids? \n\nI'm sorry, but this really wasn't the place or time to take drugs. What if you got a bad trip? What if you forgot to hide your shit away in your pocket and a kid got ahold of them? \nIt may be a low dose for an adult, but a child can react very differently.", "I suppose it\u2019s wrong that the title just made me bust out laughing.

Is it an American thing, or a xtian thing? (I recognise that both of those bodies that have an obsession with status, so this is what I expect the answer to be).

Anyone with any real grasp of these 2 drugs knows that weed is far more benign. We've known this forever. Weed is legal now, and despite enduring 80 years of a legalization process, we certainly didn't have to amend the Constitution to do it. And as much as I love to drink, you'd be blind to laugh off the Prohibitionists as just hyper-religious prudes. Alcohol does serious damage to society and interpersonal relationships. No one ever smoked weed and did so much wrong, that they had to go to Jesus and radically change their life. I know 3 people - including my mother - who would wake and drink. The other 2 would wake and drink, eat barely anything, and are slowly withering away as I type this. Gummies aren't going to cause serious accidents, regrets or ruin.

In the immortal words of Rodney, \"The war's over, get some new parts for your head.\" We went through so much unnecessary bullshit and suffering due to propaganda. Weddings could rightfully normalize it, and to call OP's actions disrespectful is like accusing him of calling the bride a cow or something. It's nonsense, he was trying to be generous. Might as well hang him for his choice of tie, it's so arbitrary.

They\u2019re the people who dictate what drugs people can consume at the event as the hosts. Don\u2019t like their rules, go and have drugs somewhere else.", "It\u2019s a false metaphor, though, is what I\u2019m saying. Bringing a flask to a dry wedding is frowned upon because the flask-bringer would have been explicitly told that the wedding was meant to be dry. \n\nI don\u2019t think that there is a 1:1 parallel here. OP again, should have read the room better, but they live in a state where the edibles were legal. \n\nI\u2019m just saying the metaphor doesn\u2019t work", "Except that millions of people drink without the intent of getting drunk, especially at a wedding. No one takes recreational THC without the intent of getting buzzed.", "I don't want my kids around the blacks. This is a reasonable position because they are my kids and I get to decide who is around them. No you do not get to look deeper into if my reasoning makes sense - they're my kids.\n\n(Very heavy /s)", "I agree, though spending too much money on cannabis is the same as anything else. Cigarettes, cars, gambling, anything tangible. Hell even plenty of Christian families ruin themselves, giving too much to the \u2018church\u2019, are they addicted? \nI disagree that it\u2019s not acceptable because it\u2019s a \u2018Christian wedding\u2019. My questions for the Christians: why is alcohol accepted at this wedding but cannabis not, despite their bible having several different quotes against it? And overall, a thing that seems to crop up in a lot of stories including religion, how is it any of your business?", "One  is allowed by the bridal party and one is not. Thats the difference.", "It's up to the wedding party which drugs they allow at their own wedding. It's not up to OP", "The alcohol is approved by the bridal party. The weed is not. That where the difference lies and thats where OP is an asshole.", "Listen man, I get your point. But honestly, that's not what it's about. The subject is actually really simple and is not about alcohol vs. weed or the legality of weed or anything like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The bridal party doesn't want something at their own wedding.\n2. OP chooses to that thing at the wedding in spite of those wishes.\n3. This makes OP an asshole.\n\nHe can do weed 7 days of the week, at pretty much every place he likes. But at the wedding of people who are not okay with that? No, not there.", "Just because I don't see it, and just because it's happening doesn't mean its okay.", "He's not doing the same thing via a different route. He's doing a different thing, because he feels like it. He does the thing he feel like without regard of the bridal party. \n\nIt's someone elses weddin. Behave. You can do whatever the fuck you want on your own wedding, not on other people's. \n\nBut some people either really need weed every day or are just asshole's who don't give a shit about the bridal party's wishes.", "You miss the point entirely.\n\nThe bride and groom don't want people taking weed on their wedding. That's the end of it. If you go against those wishes and do it anyway, you're TA.\n\nPompous, hypocritical, \"cristians\", call them all you like. But it's their wedding. OP choses to go and then went against their wishes. That's a dick move.", "Yeah I mean you can like it no shame but if you need to drink at even an occasion where people have specifically asked you not to drink then I don\u2019t know I really thing you might wanna re-examine your relationship to alcohol", "Definitely a UK thing. I've been to a lot of weddings in the states. Normally just booze, but like 95% of the time there has been weed unless it's a stick up your ass/religious/kinda bigoted wedding.", "I'm talking about the couple that was sitting at the table making all the comments. They weren't the bride and groom. Read the post again.", "People drink with the sole expectation of getting at least buzzed, lol.", "Your logic seems very flawed here. Its not OPs child. \n\nIt's perfectly legal to do lots of things. It's still not ops child.\n\nIts totally legal to huff lighter gas where I'm from, definitely wouldn't want you doing that at my wedding around children. \n\nIt's totally legal to use experimental chemicals to get high. The only difference between using a synthetic molly and drinking is societal stigma. That STILL doesn't mean a thing because it's not up to OP TO DECIDE.", "What if it was a dry wedding and OP brought a flask. I\u2019m not being rhetorical. If you think that it\u2019s OK to bring a flash drive wedding then I see what you think he did is OK.", "We don\u2019t have that information though.", "The bride literally told OP\u2019s friend that she didn\u2019t care.", "Just because YOU aren't okay with something, doesn't mean that thing isn't okay.", "Hes literally partaking in the influence of a legal substance. Which is what the hypocrite couple is doing.", "I have never been to a dry wedding but all the ones I know of didn't have alcohol to save money, not because they are opposed to alcohol.", "Still pretty unsavoury to open up drugs that clearly aren\u2019t meant to be consumed at a wedding. If someone brought alcohol to a wedding where none is served they\u2019d be the AH, same logic here.   \n\nHonestly even if a substance is not \"technically\" addictive it is pretty dysfunctional if one can\u2019t go through one event without it.", "No one is arguing against this. People are just saying that the \"think of the children\" is a bad, pearl-clutching argument - especially if there are drunk people around.", "I totally fucking agree with you 100%.", ">If I were you I wouldn\u2019t make a habit of doing things around other peoples children just because you think it\u2019s acceptable.\n\nThe flaw in your logic is that if we go down this route, we can stretch it to virtually anything. \n\nThey don't approve of legal substances? Maybe they don't approve of hip hop music, or shots, or stereotypically girly cocktails, or dresses above the knee, or whatever the fuck. And while that's their right, they don't get to impose their views on people around them.\n\nOP was doing something legal in public. If other *guests -* that's right, guests, not the hosts - have a problem with that, that's exactly what it is. Their problem.", "That logic can fuck right off. It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s job to parent your children. If you\u2019re drinking in front of kids, you have no leg to stand on when criticizing someone for legal marijuana use. No one offered the kids a gummy. What is this pearl clutching over a 5 mg weed gummy. Get over yourself.", "I\u2019ll back this up! I agree!", "Well we do, the bridal party was fine with a bar but kicked out OP, so they're clearly happy with one and not the other", "It's not about me. Or you. It's about the bride and groom. It's their wedding aftera all.\n\nThey were not okay with it on their wedding, that means it's not okay to do weed in that situation. Period.\n\nFor what it's worth, personally i'm okay with it. But you have to go with the wishes of the bridal party on their wedding on this one.", "Them being hypocrite or not is not what this is about. This is about a guest at a wedding going against the wishes of the bridal party.\n\nThe bridal party is allowed to have wishes on their wedding. If they don't want weed, you're just going to have to put on your big boy pants, be a good guest and don't do weed."]}
