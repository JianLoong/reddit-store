We were both working between two stores, alongside a third person (22M) . One of the stores was pretty good to begin with but the other, smaller store had a manager with some major ego problems which he took out on colleagues. All three of us were sharing the situation so not a single person needed to be there full time. Over some time I noticed that people started responding to me differently. I found out that the older guy was gossiping about me in the store I preferred, people jumped onto the bandwagon and it wasn't a great time at either store. To top it all off, I tried refusing to speak negatively about they guy with ego problems so I got grouped in with him and found out he was gossiping about me too. It got to the point where I got thrown under the bus because they thought I was buddies and the other two could be relieved of ego man duty. Overall a shitty time and I got depressed. \n\nI finally got myself out of that situation and found myself in a similar one where I was working at two fresh new stores. They both had a larger number of staff but I made my preference known this time. I found out that the older male had applied to the store I preferred less, I recommend him for it. I tried to be nice initially but he decided to be a jerk and completelyundermined me, so I requested not to work with him. That store was nice enough to try and not roster us on together. I also had gotten close with those at my preferred store so I shared my experiences. After a while, I finally got to work at my preferred store only.
