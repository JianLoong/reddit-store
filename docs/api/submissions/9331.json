I know I hurt you so I don\u2019t want to intrude, please reach out when/if you\u2019re ready to talk.\u201d Then leave the ball in her court and wait for her to reach back out (obviously at family functions don\u2019t ignore her but don\u2019t keep pushing her and texting/reaching out when she clearly doesn\u2019t want to talk to you).\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t clear my judgment is YTA", "YTA. I'm sure they realize how fortunate they were to be there for their child and that their child is ok. You're like that person at a party that makes sure everyone knows how they killed the pigs to make the bacon for the hor d'oeuvres.", "OP should not have kids", "YTA, your only job as her sister would have been to relieve her and her husband with a little caretaking (of the kids, by doing their laundry or housekeeping, and maybe through dropping off or arranging delivery of meals.)\n\nThen you should be available to offer emotional support as your sister processes the horror of needing to resuscitate her baby, and worry for baby\u2019s life.\n\nIt is NOT your job to try and humble your sister by pointing out her privileges when she has just been through a huge trauma. \n\nWhen she needs some humbling or to be reminded that there are many people whose life is harder than hers, she will ask for that. \n\nUnless you are the parent of a child who is lacking in empathy, your job is not to preach to others about their privileges. \n\nYou owe your sister a huge apology.", "You and your mom are major AHs. Shame on you, your sister just went through something very stressful and emotional and you shit all over that. YTA", "NTA, I think your sister might have misunderstood the point you were making.  Maybe should have used the word blessed, your sister and her husband were blessed that they could spend every hour with their baby.", "Would have been totally free to not say that to her yta", "YTA. Not everything needs to be verbalised. It\u2019s quite obvious that a single mother may have struggled to juggle her responsibilities, but she\u2019s your sister, who has just been through what is likely to be, the most traumatising moment of her life, and you respond to that by pointing out her \u201cprivilege\u201d? \n\nHow did you expect that comment to go down?! Trying to add unnecessary guilt on top absolutely makes YTA.", "YTA.\n\nMaking that comment served no purpose but to make her feel bad. That's what you wanted, it's so obvious, everyone can see it. Fuck, they can see it from space.\n\nAnd what's with the CPR is mandatory where she works comment? What does that even mean?  Even someone who isn't mandated to know CPR will still attempt it! Are you trying to say that the only reason she did CPR on her own baby was because she knew how, otherwise she wouldn't have? Is that what YOU would have done?", "You're not the asshole for speaking the truth, given what she said, but the timing was a problem. A softer approach would have been better. \n\n\"I can't imagine what it was like. It ripped my heart out just thinking about him in there. Thankfully, you guys were able to spend the time in the hospital. Could you imagine what single working moms must go through in a case like that?\"\n\nThat way you aren't using the loaded word privilege, and possibly making it seem like an attack to a person in a fragile situation.", "Huge hugs to you. I had to do CPR on my father while waiting for emergency services. He still passed away. The trauma from that follows me every day. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine having to give my own child CPR. OP is not only and ah but vile.", "Hell, I had to do it on a stranger and 20 years later I\u2019m still traumatized.  I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that", "Doing CPR properly also means that there's a high risk of breaking someone's ribs; it's awful but the amount of force you need to do chest compressions properly means it's likely to happen. I can't imagine having to do that to a family member, much less my own child.", "YTA.  You made a unbelievably cruel comment when your sister is still emotionally raw.  \n\nWhat was the purpose of your comment? Trying to hurt her when she is just beginning to recover from an anguishing ordeal? Trying to provoke her by starting an argument?\n\nBTW, your mother is an AH too for siding with you.", "And then she had the gall to ask for old baby stuff! Which recently belonged to the baby OP 2as so callous about", "people like OP blow my mind. how does she not understand she\u2019s a massive asshole. Just because other people have it hard doesn\u2019t negate the experience her sister is going through. \n\nOP YTA", "No matter how bad a situation is, someone is always experiencing something worse. There is no limit to human misery. That does not lessen the suffering or intensity of feeling of someone going through a personal tragedy. Yes, some people's kids die in the ICU. Does that mean she shouldn't have been terrified now because hers lived? Some people can't visit their kid in the ICU at all for one reason or another. Again, that doesn't mean a parent who does visit is less devastated. Do we then need to bring up parents who lose multiple children? Parents in war zones? Don't keep score of someone else's tragedy. It's a really bad look.", "I have never instantly hated someone like this but OP brought out more anger than I ever expected from AITA. My oldest was in the hospital with RSV among other things and hearing her say the only word she knew at the time \"dada\" over and over as they repeatedly failed to get the needle in her vein still makes me tear up every time I think about it. She is 6 now and a tough bad ass little girl", "Absolutely. The experience of having your child hospitalized for 3 weeks (so I'm guessing it was super serious. Probably life and death) isn't scary enough. OP is talking about privilege like this is some academic discussion at a college forum. \n\nGet a grip ok. Console your sister and move on. She can be privileged and not feel like it. Most of us don't take the time to reflect on \"how great it actually was\". \n\nYTA.", "Exactly. It costs nothing to be kind. If you just *had* to say something\u2014and you really, really didn\u2019t\u2014a more empathetic response might have been, \u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to be there with him.\u201d End of sentence.", "Right? My cousins month and a half year old was in the icu for two months and she rarely left his side. She was lucky it fell under her maternity leave and she has a really good work environment that would have allowed her paid leave otherwise but holy crap that is traumatic as hell. Poor thing already had PPD then the baby got sick.", "OP needs to develop some basic social skills ASAP", "YTA at 2 week old my daughter (spoiler alert she recovered and is doing great) was hospitalized for 1 week (3 days in PICU) for respiratory issues. We went to the hospital by ambulance. One nurse told me had we not come to see a doctor that day she probably would have died that night as her oxygen levels were very low. This was the scariest thing. \n\nYour sister went through a lot and your reaction is to talk to her about how privileged she was? You owe her a big apology.", "Agreed. And frankly even if she was judging other parents imo the only reason to bring it up there and then is if someone in the room had had that experience of having to leave their child at the hospital. If not you ignore it and address it at a later date because she literally just got home from an incredibly traumatic experience and needs time to heal before checking her privilege", "3 hours later with no response from OP, I feel fairly confident in saying no, she wasn\u2019t judging other parents. I am taking OP\u2019s lack of answer as an answer.", "I had experimental open heart at 14 days old in an era before cell phones, before monitors in the waiting room, before a lot.\n\nThe AMAZING hospital staff made arrangements with the Italian restaurant across the street to stay open all night, told my parents that was where they should wait, and when the surgery was over the surgeon walked across the street and updated my parents that it had gone well. \n\nThe little Italian grandma that ran the kitchen apparently stood over my mother and made her eat soup at some point during the night by threatening her that she was going to need all her strength for when she could see me.\n\nFor the next 25 years, my mom took me to that restaurant any after every single cardiologist appointment and ordered soup. I recently found out she drove down there twice a week during the Covid closure to get takeout because she desperately didn\u2019t want it to go out of business like so many family businesses were.\n\nShe says that was the first time in her life her mother couldn\u2019t comfort her because her mom had never had to agree to let surgeons do experimental surgery on a child of hers and she felt older than her mom.\n\nMy own kids are grown now and I still can\u2019t even think of being in a position like yours or hers because my extremely active imagination simply shuts down and protects me from being able to try and out myself in a position that painful.\n\nI wish no one ever had to sit with their child in a NICU - at the same time that I\u2019m so grateful there are NICUs for the babies that need them. \n\nBut yours is a club with a bond no one could ever understand from the outside and I\u2019m so sorry.", "Yeah- it took months before I could kiss my partner again. And I had trained in this for years in my jobs.", "Sorry you did too.", "CPR also doesn't work most of the time, which a lot of people trained in it are aware of.\n\nEven if you're kn th hospital and receive CPR from the best trained professionals available your survival odds are about 20%\n\nIf it happens in the street it's about 5%\n\nI would assume that giving CPR to your own child, aside from the absolutely terrifying experience with the sounds and feeling what cpr does to the body, but you'll also be doing it knowing you're basically just giving them a minimal chance.", "Yeah- the technique on a newborn you use your two thumbs and try to hit a depth of 1.5 inches. Try doing that when you are filled with adrenaline.", "Thank-you! Wtf?! Just because we're single moms doesn't mean we're automatically bitter, callous bitches. Woah! I would never say anything remotely like this to my sister.\n\nOP just sucks- regardless of her mom status. YTA", "They could have said something like \u201cthank goodness you guys were able to be there the whole time\u201d instead but it sounds like they were a huge AH about it.", "Excellent job and making your sister not want to be involved at all through your callous disgusting comment, don't expect anything from her.", "Your sister is giving those clothes to mothers less privileged than you. Shouldn't you be understanding after berating her about privilege.", "God forbid you ever need to do CPR on your *baby*", "Take that first week, reflect, and then apologize. I\u2019m sure in her time in the hospital she was more than aware she was in a better position than most when it came to being able to be with her child. \n\nYour comment was majorly uncalled for. It\u2019s most definitely not your place to remind her of \u201cher privilege\u201d and then when she good and upset have the gall to ask for things for your own child. That is a \u201cprivilege\u201d in and of itself. \n\nHopefully this new baby will give you the rude awakening you desperately need.", "There is a huge difference between having to leave your kid and choosing to leave your kid. I know someone who decided that visiting their kid in the NICU wasn\u2019t necessary since there was always a nurse around and if they didn\u2019t spend time in the NICU they could focus on getting their body back in shape and continue to go to brunch and stuff. She brags about the fact that she only saw her kid 10 times in the first 3 months of life and that\u2019s how she looks so great now. She\u2019s still a crappy mom who does the bare minimum 6 years later. I\u2019m judging her and anyone like her, but parents who can\u2019t be at the hospital because of work or kids or financials whole different story.", "Whoa I was hospitalized at 5 and 7. All the rooms had an extra bed just for a parents \ud83d\ude31", "Sick kid chiming in - it must be SO hard on the parents. My mom moved into the nurses residence when I was in hospital for 7 weeks a 3hr plane ride from home.\n\nIdk how my mom coped. I had a 5hr surgery and multiple other procedures, and was left with a temporary tracheotomy. \n\nThere was a kid who had to live in the hospital because he was on a ventilator at night and his home had no power. His grandmother visited when she could but it was expensive. \n\nIts an impossible situation all around. I am LUCKY my mom could stay with me, and it SHOULD be the norm. My heart aches for those who just can't.  \n\n\nAlso OP - YTA - what did you hope to achieve by that comment?", "Good point. I was not reading it correctly.", "I'm so sorry you went through that. My brother had to do the same for my dad.", "I\u2019ve done it. And yes, it was my daughter.", "As a single mom, that\u2019s exactly my thought too. I can\u2019t even begin to rationalize that complete lack of human emotion OP has to her nephew almost dying and her sister experiencing that trauma.", "Classic reddit. OP is single, must be cuz she's undesirable and bitter as all single people are /s \n\nSingle moms are amazing. Moms with great support  systems could be shitty. OP being miserable is of her own doing, not because she's single.", "Doing CPR is an absolutely wrecking and traumatic thing. It is not like movies at all. I won't go into anymore physical detail, but it's awful trying to fight for a loved ones life.\n\nOP You're a giant AH. There is always someone that has it worse. You honestly sound like you have zero empathy or compassion. Perhaps see someone about that", "The burn \ud83d\udd25", "I honestly hate this person I've never met. Apparently this is a hot-button issue for me, because it feels like the top of my head might blow off, like a volcano.", "Oh yes, you\u2019re right there. But people like the person you describe are the exception. Most who aren\u2019t there with the little ones wish it was otherwise. It totally depends on the reason.", "That would have been so nice. My son spent first two weeks of his life in the NICU. There was a rule against sleeping bedside and all they gave us was a rolling chair to sit in. We also couldn\u2019t eat anything or drink anything except water in the room. They had a lobby area that you could eat and drink in and many parents pulled chairs together and slept in those. If someone told me I was lucky to be there I would have lost it on them. The sister has more control than me. YTA OP", "My baby was hospitalized and put on oxygen at children\u2019s hospital. I have to say they were so incredible and family friendly. They had a couch that doubled as a bed for parents and they let my toddler come by during the day. I felt so lucky to be able to be there day and night. I genuinely couldn\u2019t imagine leaving him because it was so scary seeing my kid so sick. I ended up going on unpaid leave for it since I\u2019m also breastfeeding as well. \n\nIt was a complete privilege that I had the family support to be able to take unpaid leave and to stay at the hospital, but yeah I understand OPs sister. As long as it wasn\u2019t snarky towards parents who have to leave. \n\nI was really in awe with how children\u2019s hospital treated families. They even came by and brought donated toys to my baby!", "Times have definitely changed. Caring for babies and pediatric patients things have changed for the better, no doubt about it.", "My mom had a dear friend who had a long, drawn out battle with an incurable cancer. My mom would always catch herself when she as upset about something and remind herself that others have it far worse. Oh, the washer broke, not again, that kind of stuff. Her friend once overheard mom say it to someone else and gently corrected her. \n\nShe said your problems *are* problems and you have every right to be upset. Just because others have it worse doesn\u2019t mean you should downplay your own struggles. Whenever I\u2019m tempted to tell someone else they don\u2019t have it so bad, I think about what Mary said and keep my stupid mouth shut.", "I was a paramedic, I did CPR on people. When my daughter was a toddler, she choked once and I freaked out. I *held it together enough to help her* but that doesn't mean I wasn't scared to death. Having to do CPR and then go to the ICU for a week isn't \"privileged\" OP is a massive AH.", "Yup CPR is incredibly physically demanding. If I remember my instructor correctly, the average person can only do it continuously for a few minutes before they're too exhausted to continue.", "It\u2019s certainly not a fun experience.\n\nThe first time you hear and feel a person\u2019s ribs fracture whilst you\u2019re giving them CPR is terrible. \n\nBut, you must keep going and not be afraid of this happening. You still need to administer the right amount of pressure and chest compressions.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realise how common it is for this to happen. If the patient is elderly, a small child, injured, or has brittle bones due to a medical condition, it\u2019s pretty much expected.\n\nIt\u2019s also common for patients to vomit during and after CPR. The movies tend to leave this part out as well.\n\nIt\u2019s very distressing for family and friends to witness, which is part of the reason why we escort them out of the room.", "That burn was hotter than the 2 candles I just lit.
