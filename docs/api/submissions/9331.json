Many people die in car accidents!\u201d YTA OP, what the hell is wrong with you?!", "YTA why was such a comment necessary? She's been through so much already and you're guilt tripping her for no good reason. What's your deal? You're one of those people who has to insert your political views into every conversation aren't you?", "YTA, that remark was absolutely unnecessary", "YTA\n\nI was a single mother to a beautiful disabled daughter who spent quite a bit of time in hospital after each surgery she had.\n\nThere is absolutely no privledge in having a child in hospital.  It doesnt matter if there is one or two parents.  The fact is there is a child in hospital and the parents suffer.\nHoly shit have some empathy for them", "YTA she was talking about a stressful traumatic experience and you decided to tell her that other people in the world have it harder?\n\nYou seem determined to minimise her experience. Of course she's still angry. You were a jerk to her when she was sharing something really scary that had happened to her.", "YTA. You may be technically correct in what you said, but it added nothing helpful to the conversation or situation. Sometimes it's ok to just keep your mouth shut", "YTA. I was a single mum for years so I know how hard it is but I'd never tell a mum she is lucky when she has a child in the ICU. No one is lucky in that situation whether they are single or married.", "Of course YTA. You said this? What is wrong with you?", "Yta and I gotta ask are you a single mother jealous of her \u201cprivilege\u201d", "Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary? If you can't answer yes to at least two out of three, button your lip.\n\nUnless there's something big that you're leaving out, like someone else at the table had been in a similar situation and not been able to stay with their baby, you got a solid *one* and should have kept your mouth shut. \n\nAnd you only care about it because now you can't get free stuff off her: maybe you should know how privileged you are to have a family able to help you out, lots of people don't even *have* relatives whose kids have outgrown their baby stuff already.\n\nYTA", "Wow. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA - the fact she had to do CPR on her own child is horrendous! The only way to properly do CPR is to break the ribs cause you have to do that to get to the heart to make it beat! Wow you're awful! Yes, some parents have it harder, but it is not a competition! I wouldnt want to have to do CPR on ANYONE let alone my OWN CHILD!", "YTA \nI think everyone explained why already", "YTA\n\nYou completely undermined a very traumatic experience your sister and her family went through, then asked for free stuff. The fact that you *think* she might still be mad shows a deep lack of awareness on your part.", "YTA why on earth would you say that to her? Working parents would probably have taken FMLA to care for their sick kid. A single parent would enlist help. People don\u2019t just leave their baby alone in a hospital. Your comment also trivializes the sacrifices and hardships they went through in order to make sure they didn\u2019t leave his side. I\u2019m just confused why you\u2019d say that in the first place.", "YTA. For other people can be harder to be at their child's bedside all the time... So what? How was this relevant in that moment? She had to perform CPR on her own child. This means her child stopped breathing or having a heartbeat long enough she had to force it. \n\nIs she lucky that she could spend time looking after her child in the hospital? Yes. Does everyone have the same chance? No. But what you said was unnecessary. It was not the time nor the place. \n\nHave you ever had to see your child stop breathing? Have you ever felt your child's heart stop? Have you ever had your child's life depending on how good you are at performing CPR, knowing that it could not be enough? \n\nShe felt her child slip away. And she spent days at the hospital. She was tired and terrified as was her husband. And instead of showing your support you decided to tell her \"it's not that bad that your child almost died, you got to watch him\". \n\nEveryone knows that there are worse situations, but what is the point of pointing it out? Why should she feel better about the fact that someone else might not have the chance to stay with their children? Some people in some parts of the world cannot even go to the hospital so the child would probably have died. Do you want to point that out too? \n\nI seriously don't understand why some people have to turn everything in a competition or in a teachable moment. It's not like she can't complain or be scared if someone has it worse. That's plain stupid.", "YTA. Did you seriously use the word \u2018privilege\u2019 to a mom who\u2019s one month-old almost died?", "YTA. Have you absolutely no empathy? Her kid was in ICU for 3 weeks and you cast shade on how it affected her? You'll be lucky if she ever talks to you again.", "YTA\n\nThis is why privilege is a really shitty word/phrase. Yes, I get the meaning, but at the same time it also discounts a lot of other factors.\n\nWhen you're talking about your baby being so sick that they have to be hospitalised for weeks, I think it says a lot about a person to turn this in an opportunity for privilege discussion. Learn to read the fucking room, and maybe consider that constantly trying to turn every discussion into an \"us and them\" situation doesn't reflect greatly on you.\n\nIf you want to be considerate of so-called privilege, work on yourself and consider your own actions and place in society. Don't shit on other people who are already having a bit of a shit time.", "No good argument ever starts with \"it could have been worse.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA yes, she was soooo privileged to be able to watch and experience her child's traumatic near death experiences first hand and not have to work....\n\nSeriously, seek therapy for your lack of empathy. Your comments sounds like you are a robot without any emotional understanding.", "People like you are why other people shut down when told of their \"privilege\".  You use it as a weapon.  YTA.", "OP, you are definitely TA.", "YTA \n\nThere is a time and place for all your words. Sometimes, that time and place is while you\u2019re showering alone, away from all ears.", "YTA\n\nYou never ever say that about someones children. The way you said it compares to saying she had a few days of and could take a vacation, like it was all planned. I'm sure she felt that it was said this way.", "Nta I was exactly the situation with one of my kids,  it was the worst time of my life. I even caught hand foot and mouth at the hospital and got conjunctivitis. It meant we weren't able to trade off  one I caught it, but we were privileged to be able to have one parent with him at all times.", "YTA - def guessing along with everyone else that you\u2019re a single parent and few resentful that she\u2019s getting attention and has support. Bc if not\u2026 yikes.", "YTA you are one of the worst people in history saying that the life of her child meant nothing\n\neven Hitler wouldn't be as callous and uncaring", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming she believes in immunity debt too. Check your privilege. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Glad her kid wasn\u2019t turned away like many of my poorer friends this winter.", ">Have you EVER done CPR on a family member?\n\nYeah, I've done CPR exactly once. *It was one of the most traumatic things I've ever done*. And it was a fucking stranger, not my own child. \n\nI will never forget the sound of snapping that elderly man's bones with my body weight. When the fire department arrived and took over and I said I heard and felt his ribs and maybe his sternum break,  this big firefighter pulled me in for a hug and said that's good because that meant I was doing it right. He looked me in the eye and said if the man lived, it would be because of me, and whenever I thought of how awful that was, I should remember that. \n\nIf you've done CPR on a person, you know how fucking awful it is. I would need so much therapy to recover from doing that to my own child.", "I read a piece once calling it the oppression Olympics but yeah this is completely bonkers and it\u2019s kind of disturbing a lecture of privilege could even go through someone\u2019s head here.", "**Your sister is right to sell them or donate them to those that are less privileged than you.**\n\nThis made me laugh out loud. Got her!", "Or you know talk about \u201cprivilege\u201d ever when it comes to death and serious illness in someone\u2019s immediate family. There is a time and place. This is definitely not it. Save discussions on privilege for when your sister decides to stay at the Star Wars resort or The Grand Californian in Disneyland not when she\u2019s fresh out of the icu with her infant.", "It was a way to bring back the family attention to herself. God forbid she isn\u2019t the center of it.", "It is true some people are less lucky and have to leave the hospital. It also true that some people live in country with no healthcare. So what was op point?", "Well said! You should write OP's statements for her going forward, save her the embarrassment of putting her foot in her mouth again. :)", "I am a single mum, and have been in that situation. My 10 day old spent 2 weeks in NICU at the time, and he\u2019s just turned 18. Any parent/caregiver who has been in that situation would not be saying that to another parent!

But I also wish you some lightning crotch with a side of poo during labor.", "I'm sorry you  had to go through that, so glad your daughter is doing well. :)", "Yeah,\n\nOP I think you need to spend so time figuring out why that was your response & why you felt the need to knock your sister's emotional legs out from under her.", "My husband had to do it on his dad, and his dad didn\u2019t recover either. He was very traumatised by the experience, it\u2019s a really awful thing to go through.", "I'm sorry about your mother. I did CPR on my 2 month old son, I knew he was dead by his coloring, but I couldn't not try, you know? I broke his ribs doing it and I can't look at scenes depicting CPR, I can't practice or redo my CPR certification because I was so traumatized. I freaked out after my youngest was born and the hospital handed me a plastic baby and tried to refuse to discharge my youngest to me if I didn't show that I knew CPR.

I knew he was dead, I just had to try. \n\nI was so traumatized, and still am, that I cannot watch scenes involving CPR. I know how to do it, but I will never recertify or practice again.

She found him on the sidewalkd in the rain, called the ambulance, then called our professor and started. I really don't know how she was able to do it, but she did. The neighbor survived.

But we all have to go eventually, and it really was her time. \n\nThe toughest thing for my mom was that she had to see Grandma dying. It was very traumatizing. So she went through allllll the old pictures and videos and wedding albums, and seeing her mother happy and smiling and looking beautiful reinforced her memories of the woman she was her whole life, not the way she died. \n\nI would say that could help your wife, as well.
