Did you honestly think when you opened your mouth that it was going to go any other way?", "The worst days of my life were the days my child was in the NICU. She was fine; we got discharged within 3 days. But my god - I did not leave that hospital room except when my husband forced me to eat. It was the most isolating and scary moment of my entire life, and I can only describe it as watching your heart connected to a bunch of machines and you can\u2019t do anything \u2014 you can\u2019t bring your heart back close to you. And it\u2019s the right thing, but it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nTelling her it could be worse accomplishes nothing. That was the WORST for her. That\u2019s what matters here. \n\nYTA", "NTA, assuming your comment was an attempt at finding a silver lining and not some kind of weird dig at your sister.", "NTA. I understand what you are saying but obviously most these readers like your sister are taking it the wrong way.", "The family attention was straying from her. She needed to underscore that the nephew nearly dying was no big deal and that her sister\u2019s just a drama queen. \u201cBack to me!\u201d", "Hey, I am a single mother and I would NEVER say that to anyone who had been in such a scary situation. YTA.", "I am so sorry.   I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how that feels.  I hope your mother recovered.", "This makes all the difference!", "Even then.... I might have just let it lie, while the stress was still fresh. Sometimes people misphrase, and if she'd said it a few times I might have said something, but when people have been through periods of heavy stress (and having to do CPR on your 1yo child is about one of the biggest stresses I could ever imagine) they say the wrong thing.", "This is important", "Some parents have no choice in the matter. Maybe the hospital is a long way from home and they can\u2019t afford to stay. Maybe they have to go back to work in order to keep a roof over the heads of the other kids. You just don\u2019t know the circumstances.\n\nWhen I was a kid parents weren\u2019t allowed to stay at their child\u2019s bedside all day, much less all night. They could only see their child during visiting hours. I was hospitalized multiple times as a young child due to several health problems. It was as hard on my parents as it was on me. Maybe harder, since they understood what was happening.", "I wish I could upvote this infinite times. YTA", "No just my first pregnancy", "I love this. Her sister should\u2019ve told her that she has entirely too much privilege to accept free baby clothes.", "My jeezus h christ is on a cracker. Also, I think he might be cheezus.", "I believe the \u201cm\u201d in the baby\u2019s description stands for male, not month. Her child was 1 year old. Regardless, still a baby and OP is still a major AH.", "\u201cYour kid nearly died, but you\u2019re privileged! Btw, can I have your stuff?\u201d", "As a mom who sat in the ICU with my kid for 7 weeks, I promise you that the sister/mom was really, really clear on how very lucky she was to be able to stop her life to be with her son.\n\nOP was trying to minimize her sister\u2019s experience, and it was a really, really crummy thing to say. \u201cGee, why are you so upset? It could\u2019ve been worse!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m disgusted.", "Is your brain okay?", "Just because it's hard for some parents doesn't mean your sister isn't suffering as much as she did.She has to revive her baby and she doesn't even have time to stress it out. She must have been through every parent's worst nightmare. Please feel sorry for her.", "I also think OP may be single.", "Unfortunately, no.", "Yeah, that's their point. If Sister was saying it like above \\^\\^\\^ then it's a little more understandable OP would point out their privilege. If, however, Sister was just generally commenting on not being able to imagine leaving the baby, then OP brought up privilege very unnecessarily.", "You're about to find out what it's like to love, worry, and be afraid for your child. When your kid gets sick or the first urgent care visit, and there will be one, I promise that you will see how upsetting to see a child in pain really is. \n\nEnjoy your privilege.", "Then you don't need her baby stuff as much as a single mom with other kids.", "Let\u2019s hope your baby is born with the privilege of not needing to be in the NICU straight after being born.", "So what\u2019s your point about comparing her to single parents or working mom?", "It really depends on the context surrounding the,\"I couldn't imagine leaving my child alone at the hospital\". Some parents are judgemental assholes.", "Wonder why.", "\u2639\ufe0f\ud83e\udd17( I\u2019m sorry the hug looks so happy; I\u2019m so sorry for what you went though)", "I\u2019m so sorry \ud83d\ude22", "I\u2019m so, so sorry.", "What?", "It\u2019s okay. It was a few years ago now.", "It depends how the sister said \"I couldn't imagine leaving my baby alone in the hospital.\" If she was genuinely grateful she didn't have to, OP was the asshole. If she was comparing herself and her husband to another family who did have to leave their baby alone in the hospital, then OP is not the asshole and she deserved the reality check.", "I've been with friends single and as couples have to leave their baby at the hospital and have family or friends  rotate in. It is heartbreaking regardless. When any parent has to leave their baby in nicu it is heartbreaking. I don't get why people are being so critical of something so traumatic. It is really not the time or place.", "As have I. I have also been the parent with no family and a child at home, with another in the hospital. Like I said, if she was just saying she was grateful they could be there, that's one thing, and OP's comment was unnecessary. \n\nIf it was the latter, and the sister was being judgemental of parents, the comment was needed. We don't know OP's sister, or the entire context and tone of the conversation.", "No we don't but you relationship status really doesn't negate the pain of leaving. Physically every parent needs to leave at some point to"]}
