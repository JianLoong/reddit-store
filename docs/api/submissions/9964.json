For fuck\u2019s sake. They are 4 and 2 years old. They don\u2019t even have the capacity to \u201cpay their respects.\u201d If they were being disruptive I\u2019d be tempted to call you an AH, but this is perfectly reasonable in my opinion.", "NTA you are right, this is a stretch for a 4 year old and absolutely crazy to expect for a 2 year old. They were being quiet and non-disruptive, that is the best case scenario if they are expected to attend the service.", "NTA.  These people are delusional.  They should be GLAD you didn\u2019t try what they\u2019re suggesting.", "NTA, shut them down by saying you appreciate their input and thus will not be attending their funerals, with or without the kids.", "So long as they weren't disruptive, NTA at all. A 2 year old can't \"pay attention\" to a funeral.\n\nIgnore all of these people. Don't even justify their inanity with a reponse.", "NTA. They are 4 and 2. Enough said.", "NTA. Honestly seams like you're trying your hardest not to have them have a tantrum by keeping them occupied, I'm sure your aunt would have appreciated them being at the service even if it means being on a phone or something. \n\nAlso at ages 4 and 2 the concept of death won't really make sense to them so it's not a big deal in my opinion", "NTA.   If you want any occasion with decorum, whether it be a wedding or a funeral, it is a good idea not to have kids that young present.  Bringing a two-year-old in there wouldn't have had them learn anything except how to be scolded for being dragged into an event they didn't understand.", "NTA\n\nThe kids were well behaved, they didn't make a fuss and the absolutely didn't need to watch the service. Was your family high on something?", "NTA, a funeral is no place for kids in the first place so you and your sister have done well", "INFO: how long was the damn funeral?!?!\n\nNot that it matters because the children are way too young for that. You did a good job keeping them quiet so don't stress NTA", "NTA. I can't tell you how many times at funerals I've wanted to bust out some Legos, even know at 26 I still would prefer it over sitting in silence and listening about their life.", "NTA. \n\nListen- they want pets there, but they complain about kids being kids? Crazy. Ignore the old farts and biddies. Consider staying home the next one. Offer to house sit so there is someone present during the service. Many houses get broken into during the funeral. It's an easy way out.", "Based on the title, I assumed you had let them go wild during the funeral. \n\nYou're absolutely NTA. They're too young to simply sit quietly and watch a service and they'd have been a lot more disruptive without toys.", "NTA! 2 and 4 year olds won't just quietly sit and pay their respects.  It's unreasonable! I have a 2 year old and if she can concentrate on one thing for 5 minutes that's a victory!", "NTA. One hundred percent NTA, and you have my absolute permission to ignore these crazy people.", "NTA\n\nJeez dude you did what you could with the scenario thrust on you.  You and your sister couldn\u2019t just leave two toddlers at home by themselves, and the rest of your family DEMANDED their attendance along with yours.\n\nYou kept them quiet.  Pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t be any happier if one of the kids started shrieking during the eulogy.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry your family is angry at you for a situation they forced you into.", "NTA - They\u2019re still so young, so of course they would get bored easily. Whoever scolded you was a kid themselves and I could bet that they were like that as well when they were young. Of course it\u2019s a sign of respect but are they really going to force a 2 & 4 year old to just sit still and do nothing at something they can\u2019t really involve themselves in?", "NTA, when i was younger and when we attended funerals with like the whole family coming together, they would usually have to kids in another room with a bathroom in that room, and every 30 minutes they would check on us. your a saint to your kids and dont let others tell you otherwise.", "NTA\n\n\u201cDifferent families mourn differently, but thanks for offering your opinion.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThey are 2 and 4 years old. They aren't going to watch a service. In my family, we don't even bring kids that small to funerals because it's just too much for them.", "NTA - You did great!   IGNORE these types of messages and calls.   When someone texts, act like you didn't get it.   When someone cause, make an excuse and end the call abruptly", "NTA. When I was 5, I went to my great grandfather\u2019s funeral and cried the whole time because my mom would not let me look in the casket. Be glad they were quiet and also uninterested.", "NTA!  Maybe a little malicious compliance at the next funeral will cure them of wanting to try to make a toddler sit through a service\u2026 lol.", "NTA. \n\nKids that young aren\u2019t capable of sitting still for 2 hours straight without distractions. I have a four year old and can only imagine the questions that would be blurted out in a somber setting like a funeral if I didn\u2019t have quiet activities for her. \n\nYou and your sister came with a great plan that still included them (for your families sake) but also gave the kids much needed distractions. Funerals aren\u2019t for young kids, so they should be happy the kids were even there to begin with.", "NTA- I was just a funeral in June where there was a 1.5 year old (great grandson of the deceased). His presence was very much welcome and made a difficult day more enjoyable for everyone. He was quite most of the time but could be seen walking the aisle, saying hello to people and occasionally vocalizing during the service but it made the whole thing more light hearted for everyone. \n\nThe idea that children should be expected to sit still and stay silent is so archaic. If they weren't being disruptive, I don't see the issue. Please ignore these family members", "NTA.  Tell your family that kids have a much shorter attention span and they are fools in wanting to force them to pay respect the way they want them too.  Looks like you have a great system for the kids until they get to an age where they can put more attention and better yet UNDERSTAND what is going on so they can pay proper respect at that time.  You and your sister are doing great, don't let the family dictate otherwise.  They would also complain if the kids were to get loud which certainly would happen ant their ages and you would still get the same messages.", "NTA. Tell them this: next funeral you get to be on babysitting duty.", "NTA yeah you should\u2019ve just explained the concept of death to your two year old \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 they sound crazy", "NTA it's not like they were being disruptive and loud. I see nothing wrong with kids quietly being entertained while paying their respects.", "NTA a thousand %! These people have some seriously skewed views on what children are capable of or even developed enough to do. \n\nI would completely ignore them. \n\nYour methods are great. That\u2019s about all you can do. I\u2019m an adult and I can barely stay still for a one hour service. Eff that.", "NTA\n\nThat side of the family is being absurd. A 2 and 4 year old shouldn't even be at a funeral. Can a four year old even fully understand death?", "NTA. What's a 2 y/o and 4 y/o going to learn at that time? Unbelievable. My condolences.", "> Both families have this thing about the entire family being at funerals\n\nFamilies really need to stop coming up with new stupid reasons to fight.  Like what the actual fuck, who does this help? What good does it do anyone?  NTA", "I agree with a lot of these NTAH post why would you tell young kids to basically sit there in silence because their dead relative is in a box which is a simple way to put it I don\u2019t think the kids should be introduced to the idea of death so early and especially if they were well behaved there\u2019s no reason to get backlash but then again with elder people they had different times and different ways of growing up but I still believe you did a great job", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I still remember being dragged to one when I was about 5, someone I didn't even know, and I've refused to ever attend a funeral since.  I sat outside of my grandmother's, and didn't even attend my Mamaw's or Pop's, or aunt's, or best friend's brother's.

You ladies were absolutely doing the courteous thing in the whole situation.", "NTA. They're kids--very young ones--and it's unrealistic to expect either one of them to \"pay their respects.\" Keeping them occupied and quiet WAS the respectful thing to do.

There was a livestream as well, and it's all you could see was people trying to get the kids before they toppled things over. \n\nI think the deceased wouldn't have had a problem with it, so whatever, but by comparison, some kids playing quietly are not an issue at all.", "Massive NTA! What sort of magic are you practicing to keep a 4yo and 2yo quiet during what sounds like a stuffy formal funeral?? I remember my three 5\u20132yo neiblings at their great grandparent's funeral.

Even for funerals. Two year olds don't have a clue what's going on, and four year olds have very little idea what's going on. So you need to bring stuff (as you do) to keep them entertained.\n\nThere are different ways of doing this, though. You can keep your kids entertained with coloring books, silent toys, and the rest of it, and also draw their attention when communal actions are appropriate - if the congregation is all standing, you can have the kids stand too, and so on. That would be an appropriate way of bringing the kids.\n\nIf you bring the kids, and just park them in the pew with their noses in videos for the duration of the service, that's a bit inappropriate.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nI do empathize with your position as it's hard to keep a 2 & 4 year old behaved -- and if they misbehaved, you'd have a separate problem on your hands. \n\nBut I think you're kind of missing the point here. The end goal isn't really to have perfectly behaved children -- it's to pay respects to the deceased, and it's disrespectful if you and/or the kids are actively disengaging in the service. It'd be one thing if they had a toy that they could tuck in their pockets during the service -- but to have them actively participating in activities other than the funeral is disrespectful and tactless.", "This.

Just additional information to further your argument. I agree with you. Also, keep in mind it's as low as 5-10 minutes because of technology."]}
