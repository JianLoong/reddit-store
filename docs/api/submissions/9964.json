Especially since most funerals they attend aren\u2019t for people whose deaths were meaningful to them personally. They go because parents go. This was their *parent\u2019s aunt* for God\u2019s sake.\n\nI have never, ever been to a funeral or visitation where children didn\u2019t play. Every single childhood memory I have of funerals is of me playing in the funeral home basement or something, like actually running around playing hide and seek, with my distant cousins. Because they were all funerals for old people I didn\u2019t know, and everyone would rather the parents be able to attend and pay their respects than to have to stay home with the kids. \n\nAt one funeral I attended, a small child slipped from his mom\u2019s hand, took a running leap, and planted his little feet right in the actual fresh dirt on top of this literal fresh grave. And it was a moment of levity for *everyone.* The kid didn\u2019t understand what was happening, and it was absolutely a faux pas, but people were able to look past it because who cares? The person being buried would have loved nothing more than tiny shoe prints in the earth above them.\n\nSo you choose. Either make the damn thing child free, or allow children to be children.\n\n*PS also \u201ctwo year olds can try but perhaps distraction is better?\u201d I just laughed so hard I choked on my water. I nearly did an actual spit-take. Tell me you\u2019ve never met an actual human two year old without telling me.*", "4 is not school age. Maybe preschool or kindergarten. They arguably can pay attention at preschool or kindergarten, but what they\u2019re paying attention to is designed to be engaging to them and whoever\u2019s up the front is working really hard to keep them engaged - none of this is true of a funeral.", "Holy shit they think a four *or* two year old can sit quietly on demand for two hours for something that boring?", "Good lord keeping kids that young quiet that long is impressive.", "You have my sympathy. If I knew how to fix it, I'd fix mine too, lol.", "School age is more like six in many places and they still tend to need frequent breaks to movearound.", "No worries, Mr. 99 never loses points with me.", "Hell no, NTA!  You did everything possible to make sure the kids were quiet, content, and not disruptive.  That's excellent parenting!  Your relatives' expectations for the children are completely unrealistic and usually that ends up causing disruptions and distress.", "NTA. A 4-year-old might understand death and respect, but a 2-year-old certainly wouldn't. I would be willing to bet the relatives were the type to pay outrageous amounts of money for the casket, flowers, limos, etc., just to prove how important the deceased was, even if the family couldn't really afford it.  I don't know about you, but I never wanted my children to have to little Stepford children to comply with someone else's opinion of what is correct. Children acting like children shows life goes on. They are not showing disrespect by not paying attention to the service.  They are just being children.\n\nFor my death, my hubby and kids know I want a short non-denominational service with an officiant to help with the proceedings, either on our property or at a park, followed by family and friends gathering for a good meal and conversation. I have lived a good life; I don't want my friends and family to be dragged down by a depressing service in stuffy uncomfortable dark clothing with an expensive casket and trappings that most seem to deem necessary.", "NTA - very strange that so many of your family members have apparently never met a child before.", "NTA. Somebody's taking out their big funeral feelings on a two small convenient targets.", "NTA good lord lol. In my family they would be regarded as the highlight - someone passed away but they left behind healthy, happy progeny.", "NTA. My kids are similar ages and I would have done the exact same thing. In the back near a door and/or exit and entertainment to keep them quiet and distracted. If they were focusing so much on the kids, they clearly weren\u2019t paying their respects themselves.", "NTA At 2 and 4 they have no idea what\u2019s going on. Paying their respects at that age is impossible. They don\u2019t understand what death is. They were well behaved and distracted instead of running around and getting into things.", "NTA. \nMy daughter and her cousins took over the little room with coffee at my dads funeral. Phones playing, playing tag, chatting away. Adults took turns supervising but kids under 10 can only sit quiet for so long. No one throws a fit and we clean up before we left as always.", "My MIL was very upset that my kids and some other cousins were laughing and telling jokes after her mom\u2019s funeral, we were sitting there having the dinner and everyone was being somber. I told her, her mom loved hearing her great grandkids laugh. This would of made her happy b", "NTA. At 2 and 4 your plan is admirable. If they were 7 and 9 I could understand the reaction, but your family needs to get over themselves", "NTA- Their delusional- 4 & 2 -- come on", "NTA at 4 and 2 they don't even understand the concept of death yet let alone funeral etiquette", "Right, and did these kids even know this great-aunt of theirs that well? I knew maybe *one* of my great-aunts, and that was purely because she was that grandma's favorite sister. I really doubt that even if they had the capacity to pay their respects that they would really care.", "A four yr old and two yrs old can't pay respects. They dont even know what's going on and forcing it won't help. That's literally ridiculous.", "Awww he sent grandma off with something to keep her entertained  ;)", "Your grandmother would be spinning in her grave if she found out", "It's ridiculous to show up to a funeral and have your kid watch their ipad. I'd say the same about a wedding. Don't show up at all if your kids are incapable of being present for a little while without actively disengaging and distracting other guests -- or pull them out for small bits if they misbehave as parents have been doing for centuries. They don't need to be catered to and pampered at every moment.", "Funerals can function as ad hoc family reunions. I have distinct memories of attending various elder family member funerals as a small child, and playing (quietly) in the funeral parlor with my brothers.\n\nMy daughter was 3 when my brother died. She came to everything - mass, service, wake, feast. She was better behaved than some of the teens in attendance.", "NTA. Youd have to be out of your mind to believe a two-year-old will focus on a funeral service. Pay their respects? Seriously?", "I grew up going to funerals and believe me, when I was little, I had something to keep me quiet.  A few funeral homes in my area have play areas for the kids.", "NTA. You guys did great.", "NTA. I am sure you would be getting blown up with calls and texts if they had made noise during the service too, which they undoubtedly would have if they were not occupied. You are correct that is is completely unreasonable to expect children that small to sit and pay respects. They don\u2019t even know how to do that. Honestly, I think that is far too young to be attending a funeral at all, but if your family insists everyone be there, you and your sister came up with the best possible way to accomplish that and not disturb other mourners.", "NTA.  \nIf they're quiet, then you're ahead of the game. Kids that age don't even understand what \"pay your respects\" means.   \nI dunno what happens when we die, but if my spirit was around, it would probably take joy in seeing a couple kids enjoying life, instead of thinking about  death. But that's just me.", "If all caregivers were like you two, child-free events would drop greatly. NTA!", "We brought toys and distractions for my kids for my Mom\u2019s funeral! Both kids adored their Nana, but they were 3 and 5, they didn\u2019t understand.", "I feel that the better way to show respect that day was go let the young kids stay home with a babysitter and all adults could pay respect at the funeral.", "I (atheist) went to a heavily religious Catholic funeral last year, it was also two hours and had lots of singing and bible readings and all that. It took all of my adult willpower to stay awake and respectful, I wish someone had let me listen to music on my phone. I was already out of place for privately choosing not to sing or repeat prayers, so being slightly more out of place wouldn't have been so bad.", "This is why my husband took our kids to my Dad\u2019s place when we interred my Mom. I\u2019m still not sure how much either of them understood (I know the youngest didn\u2019t understand since we went through weeks of nightmares and tears when she started to understand a couple of years later) but the last thing we wanted was for them thinking we\u2019d put Nana in a box and buried her!"]}
