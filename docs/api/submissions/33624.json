She asked if there is anything non vegan that she can eat? I said no I'm afraid everything is vegan here.\n\nOlivia then started angrily asking whether it would kill Ara to be near some meat or cheese and whether it would kill me to make one non vegan option for her.\n\nI told her to be polite and she told me to go f myself.

We're just going to gloss over that it's totally normal for her to expect that no one eats ANYTHING non vegan around her? Really?\n\nBet Olivia has been forced to go vegan at home too, regardless of what she wants, because her sister decided to be vegan and refused to have anyone else eat anything non vegan around her (or even kept in the house)", "NTA. If we ignore the word vegan, all that happened here was that you tried new recipes when hosting your family and they didn't turn out well. If it was a meat and cheese dish you could've just as easily overcooked, under-cooked, or poorly seasoned it and had it turn out like burnt rubber too. Either are unfortunate but not what I would consider an AH move.", "NTA- you chose not to serve meat at your house that time.

I\u2019m sure many of the people who love Oreos would refuse to eat them if they word vegan was on the side.\n\nAccommodating the most restrictive person is being inclusive.

Unless your niece has a food allergy or can't eat vegan food for some reason, it wasn't unreasonable for her to try it for one meal.\n\nI have never understood those who try to argue that providing non-vegan food is an equivalent accommodation to providing vegan food for a vegan.    Vegan food (again, unless we are talking about a specific sensitivity) fits within a non-vegan diet.  The reverse is not true.   I have a coworker who has Celiac disease.  While it won't kill her, even a tiny amount of gluten will make her miserable.  So as a group, we frequently end up skipping some restaurants that others like because they have a reputation for not being as thorough in preventing cross-contamination with gluten, and we may end up sharing gluten-free appetizers too.   That's because the rest of us can all eat gluten-free food, while gluten is not an option for her.\n\nAt 14, your niece is old enough to understand that the world does not revolve around her wants 24/7.

By trying to accomodate the vegan niece, you're unintentionally favouring her, and pissing everyone else off.  \nIf she can't stand seeing other people eat meat, she'll need to get over that pretty quickly, if she wants to be at family gatherings, unless she wants others from the family to not come.  \nMake vegan options, and have regular options. If she complains, that is on her. Instead of everyone else suffering for purely her benefit, and it looking like you're favouring her over everyone else/ your other neices.\n\nThe other niece is lightly an ass, but I'd say it's justified by the favouritism being shown towards the other niece, if this keeps happening, and the food is awful. Eventually one of them would snap over it.

I'm a vegetarian & lactose intolerant. Going to a gathering and DEMANDING everyone accommodate me is an asshole move and Ara will have a hard time adjusting to the real world cause guess what? She'll 100% end up working at a place where people eat meat for lunch. Yall coddling her makes everyone an asshole including her. What yall should do is simply cook a DISH for her and that's it. Not prepare an entire meal around a 15yos dietary restrictions & then get surprised another kid doesn't like it. Also vegan meat is a thing & it's delicious and there are plenty of good vegan food if you actually spent time finding good recipes. The food being shit is your fault. That's it.", "Shocked at the number of people who believe that meat simply existing makes a meal good. Maybe OP is just a terrible cook \ud83d\ude02 anyway ESH. Anytime you try a new recipe you should ALWAYS do a test run so you can adjust it to taste better. I think it\u2019s ok not to offer meat options since people who are non vegan can eat and enjoy the food just the same but it\u2019s NOT ok to offer food that you yourself admit tastes bad.", "YTA - Look, if this was, like a dinner celebrating Ara, like a graduation or birthday, and you decided to make it 100% vegan so she's be more comfortable and happy on a day that is supposed to be more about her, then I would be calling Olivia a child who needs to learn she \\*can\\* eat vegan foods, even if she'd rather not (And she can opt out if she really wants to)  \n\n\nHowever, this seems to just be a random family dinner which means you were making an effort to cater \\*everything\\* to Ara's beliefs and preferences, and ignoring Olivia's, so yeah, this mean you were favouring Ara. If you had maybe put in effort to test the recipes and make sure they, at least, tasted good then that would be effort put forth for the sake of the non-vegans. (It's still shows favouritism, but at least you wouldn't be blatantly ignoring other peoples thoughts and preferences)  \n\n\nI don't really want to call you an AH, as I think your heart was in the right place, but yeah YTA. Olivia should be taught that she can eat vegan foods, and to not be so nuclear in her response, but you, and Ara need to learn that not everyone shares her beliefs. People around her are going to eat things she doesn't approve of. She can be a voice for veganism, but she can't expect this kind of catering outside days that are meant for her (meat eaters can really suck it up a day or two a year, not eat, or not go)", "Yta - you made 1 niece\u2019s personal preferences and imposed it on everyone.  It would be more reasonable if you made a mix..  and if the vegan niece had issues, it would be her issue.  Good teaching moment for the vegan niece to see how the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her ideologies.", "ESH. You're TA for accommodating one niece over the other; apparently not for the first time according to non-vegan niece and her parents.  Vegan niece is TA for trying to force her ideals on everyone else; she has every right to believe and practice what what she wants to but the world is largely non-vegan and expecting everyone else to alter their behaviors to accommodate her is ridiculous. Non-vegan niece is TA for her telling you to go F- yourself; and over a trivial matter such as one meal, despite her thinking you may or may not be showing favoritism. Parents of the nieces are TA for allowing their kids to speak to family like that and for allowing their other daughter to believe the world should cater to her beliefs.", "Info?  How does this work at home.  Sis apparently isn\u2019t vegan and she sounds used to have non vegan stuff.  Does Ava not eat at the table with the rest of the family? Or at school?

People need to learn how to be gracious guests and deal with it.", "YTA. If the vegan food was comfortable and good quality for everyone, she would have been t a, not you. But since she was forced to eat food that, as you personally admitted, didn't taste so good - well, you're clearly favouring, for whatever reason, her sister. For most teenagers, seeing people giving special attention to one's sibling, while not giving the same attention to them, is very hurtful, and while you spent lots of time trying new recipes in order to accomodate her sister, you did not spend the same amount of time, or energy, or thought for her.", "NTA. Firstly, it's not going to kill anyone to eat vegan occasionally, and secondly it's incredibly rude and ungrateful to complain about a meal someone has cooked for you. Non vegan niece needs to learn some manners and owes you an apology", "People are going to say you\u2019re the asshole because they resent vegans not because you actually did anything wrong. \n\nThe thing is, your one niece doesn\u2019t eat meat or dairy, so you accommodated by making food that didn\u2019t contain meat or dairy. That makes total sense. Your other niece does not have restrictions to her diet, so there\u2019s nothing to accommodate for her. Is she on a meat-only diet? No. She just didn\u2019t like the food and was jealous and resentful towards her sister because you were nice enough to try and accommodate her dietary restrictions. There was no reason for you to prepare a separate meat dish for the other niece. Vegan food is appropriate for everyone. Teenagers are nasty creatures incapable of reason. But most Redditors are also incapable of reason so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole here at all. However! I have found that when you\u2019re trying new recipes, especially vegan and health-conscious ones, it\u2019s best to test it solo first. And/or to have a solid backup plan when making it for others. If the food wasn\u2019t good, you could have had money set aside to order in and satisfy everybody adequately. People get really grumpy when they\u2019re unhappy with their meal, it\u2019s good to think ahead to avoid cranky bullshit.", "But non vegans can eat vegan food, right? Or am I missing something? So Olivia could have still eaten the vegan food?", "This whole family sounds silly", "Olivia\u2019s parents could have taken her to McDonald\u2019s on the way home to get her required quantity of meat. I\u2019ve had a snack before eating a host\u2019s less than gourmet dinner. Nobody owes you chef quality food at a family gathering. I agree that the host could have had more of a range of options but if I had a niece who told me to go f myself, that would have been the last time I\u2019d have cooked for them. Ordering pizza might have been a good choice. Or just eating at another family member\u2019s house.", "If you take out the vegan detail, you can see how simple it if. You made a meal for your family, and your niece didn't like it. Not everyone likes every meal. But it's not ok to demand different food and verbally assault your host.

But you're NTA, IMO.", "When I invite people over it\u2019s not to offer them a free meal, it\u2019s basically to make them feel welcome at my own home .

Just a suggestion because I used to work within a company that had all kinds of eaters and I tried to accommodate  as many as I could. Build your own pasta bowls. All the ingredients put out buffet style and everyone builds what they like. A bowl of pasta, two types of sauce, basic tomato basil and Alfredo. A plate of meatballs, a plate of sauteed veggies. And now they have daiya cheese which honestly tastes pretty good. Label your cheese as regular cheese and vegan cheese. You can do the same for tacos or burritos bowls. It's fun to do, the kids love it too. \nHer problem watching other people eat is her own and you can't fix that. She gotta deal cuz the world does not revolve around her.", "NTA. You hosted others in your home and tried your best. Your niece broke every rule of being a good guest (I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s sick of having her food choices dictated by and/or criticized by her sister, was looking forward to your usual cooking, and this was the last straw, but that\u2019s not a you problem). Her parents doubling down on their daughter\u2019s rudeness in your home is lousy. \n\nBUT, lessons to be learned; 1) don\u2019t try new recipes for guests because stuff like this happens, and 2) if you do it anyway, have a backup plan at the ready like frozen vegan burgers and fries.", "NTA. Non vegan people can eat vegan food, but vegan people can't eat non vegan food.

Most people with food preferences are used to bringing a dish to a dinner party where not everyone shares the same preference and she needs to get used to doing this. \n\nHere is my recommendation: \nBefore the next family dinner, have a discussion with both girls on diversity and how that relates to one\u2019s lifestyle (in this case food preferences). You make a vegan dish and a non vegan dish. Then, ask both Ara and Olivia to prepare their favorite dish to bring and share with everyone. They are old enough to give cooking a try.

Do you? Have you brushed off complaints like this before? Did you really give this some thought?\n\nSecond, Vegans can either never eat in most restaurants again for the rest of their lives, or they have to learn to tolerate the sight and smell of other people eating and drinking animal products. \n\nThey can either never attend another fair or carnival, never walk past a mall food court, never walk anywhere in Italy, or France, or any country that has outdoor cafes, never travel to Asia, never attend a baseball, football, or basketball game, never volunteer at a school around lunchtime, and basically never leave their own house, or they have to tolerate seeing and smelling people eating and drinking animal products. \n\nThere are absolutely vegans for whom their diet is their own personal preference, who still eat with omnivorous friends without a word of complaint. I have a friend like that. She even cooks meat meals for her husband and grown kids when they want it, and they make sure to try her vegan meals and side dishes. \n\nThe problem is that vegans have become infamous for judging the majority of humans for being omnivorous, and for trying to force everyone to eat vegan at meals they attend. \n\nThere are so many posts like this where either a vegan tried to force friends and family to eat vegan so they wouldn\u2019t be offended by the sight and smell of their food, very rude, or a host like you makes the entire meal vegan to avoid offending the vegan\u2019s sensibilities. \n\nIf a person says the sight and smell of everything you eat makes me upset, that is generally considered unfriendly. \n\nGenerally, a host provides a vegan guest with a vegan main, and has sides that are vegan, like a serving of mashed potatoes with butter substitute, and roasted caramelized vegetables with olive oil. \n\nIf a host or hostess wishes to throw a full vegan dinner, for guests who are omnivorous, then they need to get their agreement, AND find a good menu. Don\u2019t host a dinner with vegan recipes you haven\u2019t tried out. \n\nThat\u2019s like serving one of those awful Tofurkeys from the 90s to people expecting traditional Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nVegetarians are so much easier than vegans. Indian cuisine has meat and vegetarian full dinners. IF your family was agreeable, you could have gone for a vegetarian theme like Spanish tapas, which have so many meatless options.

You want people to take your side, when you should have been open to hearing what the problem was either before things got heated, or after, when everyone cooled down.

Yes, having everyone eat a vegan meal is seemingly the most inclusive option because theoretically, no one is harmed by eating a meat free, dairy free meal...but if a person is strong on their preference of dairy and/or meat , the same way another person is strong in their refusal to engage with animal by products, the most inclusive option would be to offer a meal with both vegan and non-vegan components. \n\nESH here...

I have the vegan option coming next week since it was what is available. I'm excited to try it. A small substitution like this on an already delicious meal sounds simpler than trying to make a dish that relies more on milk and eggs into a vegan dish. It would also be simple to make 2 separate sauces, and as long as they're well marked, everyone could enjoy what they prefer, and there's no OBVIOUS animal products like a nice rare roast beef or something.", "The problem was that everything on the table was experimental", ">We\u2019ve all been guilty\n\nNo, I haven't.

Like: learn to make falafel, or aloo paratha, or samosas, or other things of that nature!\n\nThe only fake meat I like is Morningstar Farm sausage patties, but that\u2019s because I never liked regular sausage to begin with.", "Oh 100%! The chickpea meal sounds amazing. Even at my favourite Thai place, most meals start with a vegan base and then you can pick your protein (puffed tofu for vegan or various meats). It is so, so good. The puffed tofu soaks up the sauces and the veggies are chosen for their texture- things like bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms. I also made a ribollita (Italian vegetable and bread soup) a couple days ago that was completely vegan and it was beautiful. The recipe really let the veggies and good quality bread shine, and it was better off for it. Other really amazing vegan friendly dishes include certain variations of minestrone, ratatouille and many pasta dishes. \n\nSometimes the path of least resistance is the best one. Meat products have historically been the most expensive part of a meal (generally), so most cultures have at least a few really beautiful veggie dishes for when you\u2019re short on cash but still want to eat well.

Soggy and mushy, like it\u2019s been pre-chewed and spat into a jar. I know they toss it in an industrial blender and all but just, ick. Not to mention the smell, ugh. And some people also have issues with the texture of apple sauce or other things like that. I know some people won\u2019t understand because they don\u2019t have the immediate instinctual aversion to things like that and that\u2019s fine. Everybody\u2019s brain is wired differently. But even if the texture isn\u2019t akin to baby food, if it\u2019s stringy or overly rubbery, it sets off alarm bells in my head and if I try to force myself to continue to eat it, two things can happen: 1) I\u2019ll have a really bad panic attack that will devolve into a meltdown or 2) my body will reject it and I\u2019ll get violently sick. The same things happen with tactile textures too. I have to thoroughly inspect clothes before buying them, which is why I never order online unless from specific stores because if I accidentally get the wrong material, I\u2019ll have wasted money and it\u2019ll sit in my closet, never to be worn or I\u2019ll gift it to a friend that would like it and would actually wear it so it\u2019s not a waste.
