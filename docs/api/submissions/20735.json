It's nice that someone has been indulging you with this \"bit of a complicated dish\" since you were 5, but this is your family tradition, not Dan's. On his day off from cooking as a chef, you want him to cook for at least six other people, and make it a meal that he can't partake in? And then the icing on this cake is you running to mommy so you can get your family to gang up against him.\n\nedit spelling", "YTA he said No and you keep pushing it. \n\nLeave him alone, you are being a brat. He offered to do it on Saturday\n\nYou are 24 years old not 12, stop being childish. You can either make the dish yourself for \"the importance of the tradition\" or wait until Saturday.", "\"I didn\u2019t like any of these options\"\n\nWell, too bad. YTA.\n\nHe's not your servant, if he says he can't or wont', accept it.\n\nYou're being incredibly entitled and then dragging your parents into it. Their traditions mean nothing. \n\nYou can ask, but he's free to say no. ACCEPT HIS ANSWER.", "YTA. How is it that this tradition even exists if no one but your bf can make it?  Sounds like you and your family are upset because your servant refused to serve you.  This may be a wake-up call for your bf.", "Your mom and/or dad obviously made this dish for you when you were a child. Have them make it now. Honestly, you and your family sounds like pains in the @ss. \n\nAlso, if he\u2019s a chef, did he have to take a personal day in order to get off of work on a Friday night. \n\nYTA as well as your mother.", "What your family thinks about Dan\u2019s decision is totally irrelevant. If you\u2019re running to family to tattle on your partner, you aren\u2019t ready to be in a serious relationship.", "I just want to know what this complicated dish is that you were eating as a 5 year old but still insist on now?", "YTA. Not for wanting him to make the dish but they way you are going about it. He always makes the dish, but due to his religious views, he can\u2019t do that specific dish this year. So instead of respecting him as an individual for his religious views, your response is to cry about it and get your family to gang up on him? If I was Dan, this would be a huge red flag. You can\u2019t even compromise for one birthday meal.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you grow up and learn how to make the dish your self. It\u2019s cooking, not rocket science.", "YTA\n\nThere is nothing preventing you from making this complicated dish yourself or your family member that was making it when you were 5 can make it.\n\nYour BF doesn't want to spend that time making it and then not get to enjoy it.  You could move the party to Saturday, but you're too selfish or thoughtless to do so.", "YTA. Time to learn how to make this yourself.", "YTA\n\nyou\u2019ve eaten the same meal since you were 5, which means someone else cooked it all those years, who would that be? I\u2019m guessing your mom? \n\nYou said parts are  complicated and you can\u2019t do them, so just get your mom to help you with those parts. If she can\u2019t do it, then you muddle thru best you can. \n\nAdapt.", "YTA. You\u2019re basically saying your family tradition is more important than his religious tradition and you\u2019re being completely inflexible. I do believe all birthdays should be celebrated but honestly you sound childish. Who cares if your bday falls on Friday? Celebrate on Saturday or pick a different meal. My 9 year olds bday fell on a busy day this year so we sang the night before and then celebrated a week later. And she handled it perfectly fine. It\u2019s hard to imagine a grown adult who can\u2019t see the other options and refuses to budge.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also not surprised your mom agrees with you because she\u2019s likely the one who created this entitled attitude you have. Someone should have explained to you that the world doesn\u2019t stop for you before you got to 24 y/o honestly", "YTA. Why do you push your partner to make something that he is obviously uncomfortable with making? Get another caterer or find another option. Your mom is also TA because \n>she thinks Dan should just make it\n\nwho is she to say what he should make or not make? What on earth makes her think that she is entitled to anything by your partner? \n\nRespect your partner's boundaries. There is a valid reason for him. I personally am not religious, but damn me if I don't respect another person's religious boundaries. He even gave you alternatives. If you sorely want to, celebrate on the next day. It's not that he doesn't love you or don't want to do it for you, he is perfectly willing to do so when it does not conflict with his faith. So suck it up, stop bothering him to do it, stand up for your partner before your family, and find out alternatives.\n\nEdit : You are also pushing a man to violate his tradition and faith just so you can upkeep yours? That makes you a hypocrite. Why should he sacrifice his tradition for yours? If you respect your tradition, why can't you see that your partner respects his?\n\nEdit : After reading a few other comments, a great solve would be your partner teaching you to cook the dish when he has spare time or standing nearby and supervising you, giving pointers etc. while you cook it yourself. ask if that is a viable solution for him? please don't make him touch the meat when he does not want to.", "Dan certainly hasn\u2019t made it for you since you were five. Get your family to make it. YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019re plenty old enough to know that just because it\u2019s your birthday doesn\u2019t mean you get anything you want, and people need to do as you say. You sound extremely entitled. Also, tattling on him to your mother was very immature.", "YTA. Like, a huge AH.\n\nFirst of all, your family don't get to weigh in on the things that happen within your relationship. In fact, the very fact that you think that it's appropriate, when you have a disagreement with your boyfriend, to go get your parents to \"vote\" on it and then suggest that their \"votes\"/opinions have any weight at all in discussions between you and your partner, suggests that you aren't mature enough to be having an adult relationship in the first place. To reiterate: it doesn't matter what your mummy and daddy think your boyfriend should do, because they aren't in this relationship. Their opinions are irrelevant.\n\nSecondly, if you genuinely believe that your \"birthday tradition\" is somehow more meaningful and important than your boyfriend's core religious values, the literal ethical and moral foundation upon which he has chosen to build his life . . . then once again, you are VERY CLEARLY not mature enough to be having an adult relationship.  You don't need to share his religion, but dear God (no pun intended) you cannot have a long-term, workable relationship with someone who holds strong religious values if you are either so ignorant or so dismissive of them that you think your \"favourite birthday menu\" IN ANY WAY holds the same weight as their complex and carefully considered set of values and beliefs. Honestly, I'm kind of looking at my screen all squinty in horror and confusion that you think these two things are even comparable. \n\nAnd bless your amazing boyfriend for his patience and kindness, he actually offered you MULTIPLE OPTIONS to try and make up for your nonsense, and you STILL chose to look him in the eye and respond with, \"No. My mummy thinks you should contravene all that you hold to be true and important in this world because my tummy wants what it wants on my very special big girl day.\" JFC, you're about to be a quarter-of-a-century old, and literally EVERYTHING about your behaviour screams \"small, spoiled child who cannot countenance being told no.\" \n\nYTA, your question is utterly disingenuous (this isn't about \"wanting him to make dinner\", it's about demanding that he go against his religious beliefs), but congratulations because you're about to end your relationship over this.", "YTA, it\u2019s unfair to ask him to put aside his religious beliefs for something as minimal as this\u2014since he said he\u2019d make it a different day", "YTA.\n\nYou're asking him to go against his own beliefs to make you a meal. Think about how ridiculous that sounds.\n\nLearn to make it yourself or learn to compromise. \n\nYou're being unfair to him. He's not your personal chef and he doesn't have to do anything he isn't comfortable with.", "YTA--you want him to make food for not just you but your family and than offer no compromises for  him?", "YTA. \n\nYou're 24, grow up and learn to cook the dish yourself.", "YTA - Respect his beliefs. And If you eat it since you are 5 Im sure you parents can make it for you or just learn? You are 24..", "YTA. So his religion isn\u2019t as important as your traditions? He said no, and explained why, that should be the end of it, unless you comprise with a different meal that doesn\u2019t include meat. It\u2019s childish to run to your family with your issues especially when it\u2019s clear that your family is going to agree with you because it\u2019s their tradition as well. If your mum has such a big opinion, then she can cook.", "Edit: I actually re-read the post and realized you called your family to get their vote and kept asking Dan after he said no, so I\u2019m going with YTA for that. Lol at you, a grown adult, telling your mommy on your mean ol\u2019 bf, and lol at your mom for being like \u201cyeah I think he should make it anyway\u201d as if that actually matters\n\n~~I\u2019m not going to call you an asshole~~, but you asked for a favor and were told no\u2014so, time to either take him up on the three compromises he offered you, or figure something else out. It\u2019s not actually Dan\u2019s job to make sure your family tradition stays intact, and I\u2019m sure you could learn to make the dish if you practiced! Maybe your parents would help you as like a birthday bonding thing", "YTA. From your comments you and Dan have been together for a \u2018couple of years\u2019 and he has made the dish for you. So he isn\u2019t a new boyfriend but you don\u2019t even know what religion he follows that won\u2019t allow meat eaten on Fridays? And presumably this is how he has lived during those \u2018couple of years\u2019 you have been together but this particular year your birthday falls on a Friday and you think he owes you the courtesy to go against his religious beliefs because YOUR family started a tradition where you have eaten the same dang thing for 19 years (branch out here maybe) and YOUR family are guests to the apartment, as is he , but they can\u2019t be asked to take off work early or move dinner back an hour or so to make this dish and YOU haven\u2019t taken the time in 19 years to learn how to make the dish entirely? This is insanely entitled. My guess is you aren\u2019t religious and don\u2019t truly understand religious sacrifices such as no meat on Fridays or fasting.", "Traditions are nice. They also change. \n\nYou and your 4 siblings each celebrate with a special meal, together and with your parents, on your birthdays every year? That\u2019s lovely, but at some point one of you will get married, move away, get a job with weird hours, etc. The tradition will need to be changed, because the logistics of being able to celebrate this way on all of your actual birthdays will not work as you all get older, get married, have kids of your own, etc. \n\nYour boyfriend has a valid reason for not wanting to cook the meal, and since he can\u2019t eat it anyway, is he to make or buy something else for himself in order to attend? This is a bit ridiculous for a family of adults. \n\nYTA. I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t push the family meal back until Saturday, and instead go out with your boyfriend on Friday. Or do as Dan suggested and celebrate with your family on Friday and go out with him on Saturday. \n\nRelationships take compromise. Dan gave you several reasonable options, and not only did you disregard any of them, you went and complained to your mom about it. Grow up and do better.", "You can\u2019t FORCE him to make it, and it sounds like that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do. Why on earth would your mom\u2019s opinion matter? Ask your parents (who presumably made it for you from ages 5-adulthood) to make it. If they say no, then you should question why your mom insists he should. YTA", "> my family has a tradition and I know my parents would be upset\n\nA tradition of having a professional cook their meal for them for free even though it goes against the cook's beliefs?\n\nWhat a lame and selfish tradition, YTA.", "YTA. You want your boyfriend\u2019s birthday gift to you to be violating his religious principles? For a dinner anyone else in your family could also make? Just because it\u2019s your birthday doesn\u2019t mean the world revolves completely around you that day. You still have to treat the people you love with respect every day of the year, even if it means you don\u2019t get everything exactly the way you want it. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy the meal knowing it made my partner so uncomfortable to make it. Check your conscience and your entitlement, and apologise.", "YTA\n\nHe has faith based reasons, and you would respect those reasons if you respected him. \n\nOn this post, you declared that you don't. \n\nAs for having your family take a side in your romantic quarrel, that's another layer of AH.", "YTA if you\u2019re going to make your boyfriend cook for your entire family, it\u2019s not fair that he can\u2019t eat it. he gave you multiple compromises", "YTA - You can\u2019t force someone to break their religious beliefs for you. Cook it yourself or order in.", "YTA, you might not agree with it (like i dont) but it's his belief and that should be respected. He offered to do it another day or make another meal so he at least tried to compromise. \n\nIs there a reason your family can't make it? It is after all there tradition. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_fast", "YTA and bc of:\n\n\nI didn\u2019t like any of these options\n\nYour traditions are in your family, created by your parents. The importance is for them and you. For the rest of us they are different tradition or importance.\nSo why don' t  follow their own traditions by going on to cook like they started without \"demanding\" from others and ridicule the traditions and beliefs of the others ?!?", "YTA, not sure if anyone else mentioned it but why don't you make it and ask him for help with the difficult parts? I'm sure if you did the work and he did the explaining he would get you through it.", "YTA \n\nYou asked. He said no. That's the end. He even gave you his reason. You still didn't accept his no.\n\nHe's under no obligation to prepare your traditional birthday dinner, or any birthday dinner, because of his occupation. He chose to do so because he cares for you.\n\nYou are being entitled. You aren't considering him at all. The person who cares for you. You are demanding that he make your  damn special birthday dinner because he's a chef. Dan, the person, is irrelevant.\n\nMake your own food. Have a family member make your special birthday dinner.. Hire someone to make you special birthday dinner. Eat something else.\n\nYou value your damn special birthday dinner over your boyfriend. He deserves better.", "YTA. You and your family sound insufferable.", "YTA. Why not cook it yourself or ask your family for help. I mean,  you been having this dish since you were 5 so obviously someone else also knows how to cook it. You need to respect your bfs faith related reasons.", "YTA. You asked. He said no. He offered compromises, you still said no. You need to respect his beliefs and learn that compromise is how relationships endure over the long term.", "YTA - just have your parents make it just like they have every other year of your life, and stop bringing your mom in to your relationship issues. This is all coming off as pretty immature, especially with you refusing to compromise with your own boyfriend. It\u2019s just a birthday lol", "YTA, why does the importance of your \"tradition\" trump his own values?", "He gave you some options and you won't accept a compromise? Wow.\nYour parents started this, they can do it.\nYTA", "YTA-Make it for yourself this year, then you can keep your tradition of having the same meal and he doesn\u2019t have to violate his religious beliefs.", "Dying to know what this dish is.", "YTA. Birthdays may be important to you, but someone\u2019s personal religious practices are far more important to them. The title is misleading; he is willing to make you a dinner, just not one that violates his religion. Have some perspective", "Info: WHY can\u2019t you make it yourself? You say there\u2019s steps you can\u2019t do, but have you even tried to learn how to do it? Or are you weaponizing your incompetence", "YTA for putting your traditions over your boyfriend's.  Your mom can come over and make this meal if she wants to uphold your family tradition.  OF course your family is going to back you up on this.  They don't give a crap about Dan or his traditions.  Have you tried asking Dan's family how they feel about it?", "He gave you a logical reason, his religion. He is willing to cook for you as long as it is not meat on Friday. \n\nYTA. If your family takes birthdays serious, let them make the food.", "Might be going against the grain here but I think YTA. \n\nYou have been having the meal since you were 5 and still want to continue that ? Fine. (sounds boring but whatever). But why is he required to make it? He gave you reasonable options and you don't want to compromise. Then you got your mom involved, lol. Why? You are an adult and shouldn't be bbringing your mom in on tiny issues in your relationship. Can't your mom, dad or sibs make your dinner if you are so pressed to have meat and a specific meal?", "YTA - just because he's a chef doesn't mean he's obligated to cook this meal.  If it's YOUR family's tradition, then have one of the siblings (or parents) come over and make it.  He already told you no and gave a good reason why and gave good options so you could still have your tradition.  But apparently YOUR family's tradition is more important than anything else.  Also, how long have you been well aware about his religion and the fact he doesn't touch meat on a Friday?", "YTA. And if you keep running to your family every time you have a disagreement with your bf, you won\u2019t have a bf. When you love somebody, you generally want them to look good to your family.

Are you serious?", ">Most of my family is on my side because they recognize the importance of this tradition\n\n...but nobody recognized the importance of his tradition, which goes back at least 1000 years before your family's tradition started?\n\nYTA, and so is most of your family.", "YTA \n\nhe said he can't make it, make it yourself. Why is your tradition more important than his belief, whatever be the basis?", "YTA big time. Why should your tradition trump his religious beliefs?

Here's the main two:\n\n1) NO is a complete sentence.\n\n2) The way you word it. You say 'You've had Dan make it.', so you've essentially forced him to make it? Did you even ask if he would be up for it? It seems as though you just assume instead of ask, and that's not cool.", "I'm curious: What complicated dish have you eaten every year since you were 5 & still need help with?  Assuming you weren't cooking it on your own at 5, it would follow perhaps one or both of your folks prepared the specialty? \n\nMaturity has compromise as a major component.  Either do or don't.  Leave your bf alone.  Celebrate with your family & then with him.  Too much pressure here.", "YTA\n\nWhy is your birthday tradition more important than his religion?", "Yes you\u2019re the AH.

I would do the same.", "Lol \u201ca friend\u201d and \u201ctaxes\u201d are pretty far from \u201cromantic partner\u201d and \u201ccooking\u201d, but great work - your straw man both ignored \u201clove\u201d and made no sense!", "It\u2019s extremely unlikely he doesn\u2019t just handle meat at work on fridays.\n\nIt\u2019s also fine to touch meat in his religion, so I don\u2019t fully think I understand your comment.", "You don\u2019t think the standards we apply are a form of expressing ideals?\n\nYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird his gf regularly does the same thing he does at work for him and he won\u2019t do it for one night for his gf when it\u2019s special to her?\n\nIf you wouldn\u2019t do a few hours of your job for your SO to make them happy, that\u2019s already whack - let alone when they regularly do that same thing for you", "I\u2019ll respect it when they stop taking everyone else\u2019s human rights away, thanks", "What he does at his job and what he does in his personal life are two completely separate issues. Who wants to make a complicated dish that they can\u2019t eat, though? Not me. If I\u2019m cooking something that\u2019s \u201cextra\u201d, I\u2019m sure as hell planning to eat it.", "Why? Perhaps he deliberately chooses to work in a vegetarian or vegan restaurant specifically so that he doesn't have to deal with that issue. What do you think chefs of other religions with those challenges do? Hindu chefs who won't handle beef? Chefs who hold to kosher or halal dietery standards? None of this is even unusual.", "There is a huge ass difference between making a meal as a job for someone else and making a complicated meal that you then cannot eat.", "It doesn\u2019t just apply to the bf, if it were the other way around and it was her bf\u2019s birthday and special tradition then I would say she should do the same for him.", "*respect their right to follow their religion \n\nGod forbid it sound like you\u2019re respecting fiddly priests", "I thought lasagna \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd23", "I should have added that I agreed with him for compromising with her on it (trying to at least). It was more of curious thinking. I think she be more understanding about it.", "You are of course correct. I apologize for ever doubting your judgment.", "He offered to make the dish for her, though, literally the next night. He didn\u2019t refuse to do the cooking, he reminded her about his religious beliefs and offered her no less than three perfectly reasonable compromises\u2014two of which still involved him doing the cooking. So it\u2019s not some situation where she cooks all the time and he won\u2019t even make one meal, let\u2019s not try and make it into that.\n\nMy comment was intended to explain why someone might do something for their employer that they would prefer not to do in their personal life.", "cool. like i said, i only respect people who follow religion. I don't follow or respect religion for the sake of itself. i make it a point to respect people's opinions on it, and respect them when they practise it (because who am i to say that you shouldn't stop in the middle of the day to make offerings to a random made up entity if it doesn't hurt me?) You could be praying to fucking Goku or following the religion of Hyrule for all I care and I would have the same reaction.", "What's the difference? Money? \n\nIt seems kind of hypocritical to do something for countless strangers on any given Friday, but refuse to do that same thing for your own significant other on their *birthday.* \n\nWhy couldn't he have simply set a portion aside for himself before adding meat to it?", "Fasting on Friday is his special tradition. It should be respected. I'm not a religious person, but I would still say that someone's faith trumps a birthday. Your applying a double standard when you say he should set aside his religious tradition for her birthday tradition. The contraction of your comment is so obvious", "hahaha could be that as well. I just feel like whatever it is it's something OP could easily figure out and made the choice not to include it cause they knew they'd get flamed for it lmao", "Right, he offered compromises that spoil his gf\u2019s tradition so that he can eat the dish too, not because of any religious ideals. Very loving\n\nUsually your love isn\u2019t going to ask you to do the unscrupulous parts of your job, and its hilarious how first \u201cno one was talking about ideals\u201d and now you\u2019re \u201cjust talking in general not about the situation\u201d", "He can still fast, he doesn\u2019t have to eat the meal. I don\u2019t eat meat on Fridays during lent and I still make my husband delicious meals containing meat because he doesn\u2019t believe in fasting but he really likes meat. Idk, maybe I shouldn\u2019t do that for him but it\u2019s something nice that I can do and I don\u2019t mind because I love him. And that\u2019s every Friday during lent for me \u2014 this is just one day, being her birthday.", "Well, I tried \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, and hopefully learned you were holding an indefensible position!
