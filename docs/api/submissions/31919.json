Aunt J told her husband my sisters and I are not her kids at all.

He said my dad is my uncle and not actually my dad and that we should all be acknowledging this fact.\n\nIt got so tense that Aunt J apologized for what he was saying and she said she would deal with him.

I think generationally younger people use the f bomb too freely in the minds of older generations which is where their stance is coming from. Kind of a classic \u201cyou were right but your delivery was aggressive\u201d.\n\nBut honestly what do you expect from a kid being told multiple times their entire personal and familial identity is false and should be something else. The expectation of handling this like \u201can adult\u201d with less anger when you\u2019re only 16 is foolish in my mind. This is a bigger emotional, personal, and infringing topic than any adult usually encounters in life.", "NTA. \n\nPlease, what you said was gentle compared to what you could have potentially said. There are only so many times that you can ask a person to back off before you push back, and this has been building for years. Why your family still interacts with this man, only y\u2019all know that reason, but I think at this point, you\u2019re old enough to tell your parents that you\u2019re no longer comfortable seeing your uncle.", "NTA\n\nCurse words exist for a reason, and they are perfect in some situations.

People who are wrong need to be held accountable.", "NTA. NTA. NTA.\n\nI have several other curse words we can add to your vocabulary, but this thread will hide my reply. \n\nHe was disrespectful. You were firmly setting a boundary because he repeatedly stomped on the softer efforts.", "NTA. Curse him out again, if you need too. Hopefully he will get it then. Do not give him any grace or he will take it and run. Shut him down every chance you get, hell I would give your sisters  some pointers just in case he says anything to them.", "NTA sometimes you need certain words to get through to a bully.", "NTA. I agree with your grandparents that you could have handled it better, but telling him off decisively is entirely appropriate. The cursing gave him the opening to focus on that rather than hearing that he had been told off. \n\nFrankly, the way he has been fixated on you and your sibs only now that you and they are adolescents sounds creepy. Maybe he is just angling for free babysitting, but you did not say he had even mentioned that. Since you three all are genetically close to your aunt, you should have resemblance to her, particularly before she started having children. I would be concerned that his newfound interest in you three is not about family but more about you looking like his wife when they first started dating.", "NTA.

Why does he blatantly choose to disrespect his wife the way he does and think it's okay when it never ends with him being the good guy. \n\nI would try going low to no contact with this guy. If he keeps this up, I don't see him being around much longer.", "NTA. You handled this appropriately. I hope Aunt J gets away from this asshole who is clearly controlling and homophobic.", "NTA! Could you have handled it better? I mean, sure, I guess so. But full grown adults wouldn't have been expected to \"handle it better\" when someone has been repeatedly told no, to respect everyone's choices and boundaries and then keep disrespecting them and spitting on their boundaries over and over. Not only is he spitting on everyone's boundaries, he is disrespecting your parents and the family and love you have all built. To top it off, you're still a child. Yes, a mature teenager, but legally a child with a lot of life and experiences to gain still. I think he wasn't going to ever stop and someone can only take so much of trying to be the bigger person and \"handle it better\" before they have no more F's to give and he reached that point 10 miles ago. \n\nSo you are still NTA and your grandparents are low key light weight little bit TA for telling you you could've handled that better. They are the adults and all of them despite trying have been unable to handle him. He shouldn't even be around y'all with the damage he is inflicting by continually calling into question the validity of your family and support system. Each time they let him around again they are failing you and sisters, especially after this. \n\nHe is def the biggest AH in this. The therapy isn't working he has just learned to try sneakier tactics. She honestly need to divorce him now that he has shown his true colors. It feels way more than just wanting a free babysitter IMO. It's giving homophobia and it's giving alt-right conservative family values that anything else isn't a \"real family\" and you all don't neee to be around anyone like that.\n\nEdit to add: few minor changes (mostly adjectives)", "NTA.

It only matters how you actually do see it.", "NTA. Next time you have to be around this person and he starts his crap flat out state that his kids are not your siblings and you will not be babysitting them at any time in the future. Get it straight out there and shut it down before it even starts.", "NTA your aunt\u2019s husband sounds like a homophobic AH. How dare he invalidate your family like that. Your dads are your dads. Your aunt did a lovely thing but that\u2019s it. He needs to shut the f up, apologise and never bring it up again or you need to cut him out of your lives.", "NTA. Cursing was about the most polite thing you could do. At your age, in that situation, there is a 100% chance I'd have hit him.", "NTA. You handled that better than most teenagers. He has no business being around any of you until he respects reality.", "Nta. You tried being nice first and that clearly didn't work. Your uncle was escalating his behavior. Your response may have been a bit \"intense\" but you really had no choice and frankly it was your only option for dealing with the situation. Good for you for sticking up for yourself. I personally would suggest talking to your parents and going low/no contact with uncle.", "NTA. You should probably put your grandparents in their place also.

Your uncle's behavior is extremely inappropriate, and hopefully your aunt can straighten him out or realize their values do not seem to be lining up. She obviously feels very confident in the choices she made, since there are 3 of you in the world, and the egg donation process would be enough to make most women stop and think. \n\nI won't put words in your grandparents mouths, or try to read their minds, but from my perspective as a parent and adult trying to navigate this world, it's always good to reflect on how we handle difficult moments and see if there are better, more effective ways to communicate. As you're reflecting, maybe you'll find you could have stood up for yourself more calmly, without losing control of your emotions. We never stop growing and learning, and we can always strive to be better. And at the end of the day, don't let perfect get in the way of good. It was good that you defended yourself.

Uh yeah no", "NTA, you are a minor and he is the adult, he shouldn't be speaking to you about any of this. You are just meeting him with the same level of respect he has when talking to you and your family. \n\nTell your family that is criticizing you that maybe instead of trying to scold you they should deal with him and hold him accountable. He should be expected to be more cordially than the kids. \n\nAlso maybe consider asking your dad's if they can limit the time that you have to be around him or him in your home. You shouldn't have to deal with him and the vile things he spews.", "That's how it appears to me too.
