Aunt J told her husband my sisters and I are not her kids at all.

He said my dad is my uncle and not actually my dad and that we should all be acknowledging this fact.\n\nIt got so tense that Aunt J apologized for what he was saying and she said she would deal with him.

I think generationally younger people use the f bomb too freely in the minds of older generations which is where their stance is coming from. Kind of a classic \u201cyou were right but your delivery was aggressive\u201d.\n\nBut honestly what do you expect from a kid being told multiple times their entire personal and familial identity is false and should be something else.

This is a bigger emotional, personal, and infringing topic than any adult usually encounters in life.", "NTA. \n\nPlease, what you said was gentle compared to what you could have potentially said. There are only so many times that you can ask a person to back off before you push back, and this has been building for years.

Shut him down every chance you get, hell I would give your sisters  some pointers just in case he says anything to them.", "NTA sometimes you need certain words to get through to a bully.", "NTA. I agree with your grandparents that you could have handled it better, but telling him off decisively is entirely appropriate. The cursing gave him the opening to focus on that rather than hearing that he had been told off. \n\nFrankly, the way he has been fixated on you and your sibs only now that you and they are adolescents sounds creepy. Maybe he is just angling for free babysitting, but you did not say he had even mentioned that. Since you three all are genetically close to your aunt, you should have resemblance to her, particularly before she started having children. I would be concerned that his newfound interest in you three is not about family but more about you looking like his wife when they first started dating.", "NTA.

Could you have handled it better? I mean, sure, I guess so. But full grown adults wouldn't have been expected to \"handle it better\" when someone has been repeatedly told no, to respect everyone's choices and boundaries and then keep disrespecting them and spitting on their boundaries over and over. Not only is he spitting on everyone's boundaries, he is disrespecting your parents and the family and love you have all built. To top it off, you're still a child. Yes, a mature teenager, but legally a child with a lot of life and experiences to gain still. I think he wasn't going to ever stop and someone can only take so much of trying to be the bigger person and \"handle it better\" before they have no more F's to give and he reached that point 10 miles ago. \n\nSo you are still NTA and your grandparents are low key light weight little bit TA for telling you you could've handled that better. They are the adults and all of them despite trying have been unable to handle him. He shouldn't even be around y'all with the damage he is inflicting by continually calling into question the validity of your family and support system. Each time they let him around again they are failing you and sisters, especially after this. \n\nHe is def the biggest AH in this. The therapy isn't working he has just learned to try sneakier tactics. She honestly need to divorce him now that he has shown his true colors. It feels way more than just wanting a free babysitter IMO. It's giving homophobia and it's giving alt-right conservative family values that anything else isn't a \"real family\" and you all don't neee to be around anyone like that.\n\nEdit to add: few minor changes (mostly adjectives)", "NTA.

Next time you have to be around this person and he starts his crap flat out state that his kids are not your siblings and you will not be babysitting them at any time in the future. Get it straight out there and shut it down before it even starts.", "NTA your aunt\u2019s husband sounds like a homophobic AH. How dare he invalidate your family like that. Your dads are your dads. Your aunt did a lovely thing but that\u2019s it. He needs to shut the f up, apologise and never bring it up again or you need to cut him out of your lives.", "NTA. Cursing was about the most polite thing you could do. At your age, in that situation, there is a 100% chance I'd have hit him.", "NTA. You handled that better than most teenagers. He has no business being around any of you until he respects reality.", "Nta. You tried being nice first and that clearly didn't work. Your uncle was escalating his behavior.

As you're reflecting, maybe you'll find you could have stood up for yourself more calmly, without losing control of your emotions. We never stop growing and learning, and we can always strive to be better. And at the end of the day, don't let perfect get in the way of good. It was good that you defended yourself.

Then tell this jerk that you will consider yourself your aunt's son only when he hands over that amount to your dads to reimburse them for creating you in the first place.

Honestly, your yelling is likely what got your Dads and Aunt to return and put a stop to what was happening. \n\nThis needs to be stopped at YOU, because your 13 yr old sister is getting to babysitter age and she will be next in line for his harassment. \n\nNTA (and even less NTA because you are Minor being bullied by an adult).", "What indication is there that this is about babysitting?

That is something she needs to be threatened with. And i think you're old enough to chose who you want to spend time with.", "hah, that's hilarious. The 16 yr old could have handled himself better in an argument with an adult. Where I come from, if an adult is arguing with a kid and the adult is in the wrong from the start, we usually tell the adult to grow the hell up and stop picking on a kid.

An adult in your life negating your family and your reason for being is beyond ignorant. Now, back to Aunt J. At this point, if she is determined to stay in her marriage, she should be doing so with the understanding that she is choosing to drive a wedge between your family and hers, because if I were your dads, there\u2019s no way I would allow that guy anywhere near my children knowing how he feels about the situation.", "I'd point out that his nuts had nothing to do with your birth so he shares no DNA and the only reason he is a secondary family member by marriage is because his wife, your aunt, has horrible taste in men.

Can I suggest on fb you listen to a stack of reels from Jefferson Fisher, he teaches how to handle people and reactions. Excellent advice there. Also on YouTube Doctor Ramani has excellent videos on personality traits such as your relative displays.
