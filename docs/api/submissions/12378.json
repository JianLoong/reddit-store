So my (35M) wife (32F) is pregnant. She\u2019s due in 2 weeks and i am beyond excited because this would be my first child and I\u2019ve always wanted to be a dad. Yesterday, we were in bed together, talking about our baby. All of a sudden she jumps up excited with a huge smile on her face. She told me to stay on the bed because she had a surprise for me. She went into our closet and grabbed a box. It was decorated with ribbons and bows so I assumed it was a gift for me. She handed it to me with the same big grin on her face. It was obvious she was excited to see me reaction. I asked her what it was but she just kept on saying \u201copen it open it!\u201d I opened it and inside was a blue onesie with the name \u201cbartholomew\u201d in cursive stitched on the middle. Now, I had agreed that I\u2019d let my wife name the baby since she was the one giving birth and I felt as if it would be something really special for her so I trusted she\u2019d name my son something at least normal. I asked her what it meant and she said \u201csurprise!! That\u2019s going to be his name.\u201d She sounded so happy and enthusiastic so I knew she was serious. I busted out laughing to the point of tears. I honestly could not believe she was going to name our son that. What the hell kind of name is \u201cbartholomew\u201d???? She got really silent and started tearing up. When I noticed this, I sat up and stopped laughing. She snatched the box off me and stomped back to the closet. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. Apparently she\u2019s decided to name our son after her grandfather who she was very close with before he died. I told her that she should think about this because it\u2019s an \u201coutdated\u201d name. She started yelling at me saying I was judging my son before he even came out the womb. She stormed out and is now staying at her moms. I honestly can\u2019t believe she\u2019s serious. Her dad called me yelling at me because apparently she\u2019s told on me. I\u2019ve been called immature and a joke so far. I\u2019ll probably just apologize but there is no way in hell I\u2019m calling my son by that outrageous name.

NTA.", "NAH\n\nBoth partners need to come up with the name for the baby together. This is a decision that requires TWO yesses, not something where one person can just pick because it's really unfair to have one person love the name and the other person detest what their child is called. \n\nI think the idea of honoring her grandfather with Bartholomew is lovely, but perhaps you should do so as a middle name. Pick out a first name that is more commonly used now for his first name, and that way the gesture is still there, but without the spelling headaches for the kid's entire life (trust me, he does not want to be named something weird that he has to spell out three times every time he calls to make an appointment for everything for the rest of his life.)", "Everyone is going to associate him with Bart Simpson.     \n\nNTA \n\nYou responded in the moment.  You weren't mocking her choice your were baffled by her  (ridiculous)  choice.  \n\nThe she went and told her family,  (and they call YOU immature!)   \n\nYou weren't judging your son, you're judging her choice of a name.  \n\nJust make sure he has  a solid middle name that you can call him.", "LMAO! I literally laughed out loud at this and would've unfortunately done the same thing when I opened the box. I def would have thought she was joking. Glad you stopped when you realized she was dead serious. I'd give her time because she's obviously hormonal and emotional. Just call him Bart. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If my parents saddled me with some name like that I'd be the first person in line on my 18th birthday to legally change it", "NTA, I would have thought it was a prank. It\u2019s better to upset your wife than leave your child stuck with an awful name.", "NTA.  And this is why all couple should discuss the potential names of a child and come up with it together.  She picked a name that most people would veto without blinking, and then got upset when you didn't like it.  I would apologize for your reaction, but let her know that Bart ain't happening.", "NTA. If you allow her to name your poor son that he will be bullied. She needs a reality check", "NTA I'll be honest I burst out laughing too.", "I don't think your response was the most sensitive or appropriate, so it's a very mild YTA for choosing to laugh at your wife.  \n\nHowever, it's very important that both parents consider the impact a name is going to have on their child.  A name like Bartholomew, while not entirely weird, is dated and could result in bullying.  Should we all be named 'safe' names to ensure nobody is ever mocked for their name?  That doesn't make sense either.  This is the kind of thing that the parents should have a serious discussion about.", "NTA. You did give her permission to name the baby so that was a mistake, but that's not really an enforceable contract. You are a couple and you are going to be parents so it's not fair of her to expect that you wouldn't get a say. Personally I like old-fashioned names and Bartholomew is a name with a lot of history, but NTA for telling her that you don't like it. The poor kid will be called Bart Simpson for the rest of his life, not to mention Fart Bart.\n\nBartholomew could be a decent middle name to honor her grandfather.", "Nta \nThe reaction you gave her was genuine. That will be other peoples reaction too.", "Names for children should NEVER be up to one person unless they are single... and even then they should talk it out with people that will be in the child's life.", "NTA. What kind of name is that oh my goodness NO.\nYour mistake for telling her she could pick, that name is hideous.", "YTA\n\nBartholomew is not my personal style, but it has history, substance and meaning, especially for your wife. Better than yet another tired, dated defunct-medieval-occupational-surname as a first name. \n\nAnd it\u2019s one thing to diplomatically express your dislike, but you had this poor woman in tears. Both parents should be comfortable with their child\u2019s name, but there\u2019s no need to belittle or mock her. You say you thought it was a joke but you must have known it was her grandfather\u2019s name. \n\nYou owe her an apology. Bartholomew is a fine name.", "YTA.   \n\n\nEven if its a ridiculous name, you said yourself that you gave her the choice to name your son as she is the one giving birth. You also said yourself that she looked very happy and excited, and then you start laughing? Thats some asshole behavior.", "I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s 9 months pregnant and you\u2019re only just now finding out the name. Even if you let her choose the name, it\u2019s never been talked about at all? I chose the first names for our 5 kids but I didn\u2019t wait til I was practically due to tell my husband. \n  \n  \n  \nNTA, yes you let her choose the name but you had an honest reaction which was laughing. She yelled at you, she stormed out, she\u2019s staying at her mom\u2019s over this, she told her dad on you, and you\u2019re being called immature?   \n  \n  \n  \nThis could\u2019ve been prevented if you guys had discussed this at all verbally over the past 8+ months. Before the embroidery happened.", "NAH. Yes the name is sentimental to her, however comma the name is very outdated and kids are fucking ruthless. There is *zero* chance your child will not be made fun of. Even the nicknames that can come from bartholomew will result in relentless teasing.", "YTA. She's chosen a name that carries special meaning for her family and you laugh, tell her it's outdated, and refuse to acknowledge your poor reaction. AH behavior. Bartholomew is a normal name. A but long, but babies turn into adult people. He can be called literally anything as a nickname until he grows into the name.", "YTA.  Sorry, bud, but you messed this one up.  You told your wife she could name your child.  Your wife chose a name that is sentimental to her.  She proudly tried to tell you this name, and you laughed in her face.  That's a huge no-no.    \nMy suggestion? Apologize like a madman while also explaining that you were thrown off by the name.  When (if) she accepts, let it go.  The truth is that you are going to love your son the moment he is in your arms no matter what his name is, so just make peace with it.  And moving forward, may don't remove yourself from the process of naming any future children.", "YTA\n\nOld names are the trend these days. Just call your son Bart, Barthy, or Barry \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nIf you\u2019re going to have objections to any name\u2026 you should have discussed it with your wife way before now.", "NTA. I mean I get the point it is a ridiculous name. But it's something that means a lot to your wife so maybe you guys can come to a compromise, and she can give him that for a first name but you can pick the middle name something that you like and you can just call him by his middle name. I mean this is the name that he's going to have for the rest of his life so you need to remember your naming an adult you're not naming a child. I think your wife is kind of emotional right now of course because of the hormones and whatever even though women have used that as an excuse forever, and yes I've had five children, but that is a name he's probably going to be seriously teased for and he's going to struggle with as an adult so maybe she should think about that as well and maybe use that as a middle name and something else for the first name?", "Bartholomew is a fine name.  Old fashioned, yes, but could be a lot worse.  I have a friend with the name.  It's not an issue in his life (and he goes by Bart). YTA", "Am I the only one who thinks Bart is going to be a fine name? In a classroom with 20 Liams, be the Bart. \nMaybe I\u2019m biased because I find most of the current popular baby names atrocious.", "Bartholomew is a real name.  Old fashioned, sure, but a real name. Call him Barty, Bart, or Berty. What is the big deal?  Several of my kids have nicknames that are quite different from their legal names, and many people don\u2019t even realize it.   YTA", "YTA, You could have discussed and reservations you had like an adult, instead of reacting like this. Laughing to the pony of tears? At a name that carries so much sentimental value to her? An apology and acting like her partner would be in order", "\"Now, I had agreed I'd let my wife name the baby...\"\n\n\nYTA. Simple as that. You trusted her, she chose a name, and you laughed at the idea and called it outdated. On top of telling her to reconsider. The name was personal to her. \n\nBy virtue of you mocking the name, you mock the memories she had with someone who was dearly close to her.\n\nSorry bud, you were being an AH here \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA 100%. You agreed to let her pick the name. A name is just a name unless it has a special meaning. Who cares if it's out dated alot of the current names are honestly kind of dumb sounding simply because people felt the need to come up with something new and cool. When in reality it's just difficult for everyone else because they don't know how to pronounce some crazy ass spelled name.", "Do people really not know that Bartholomew was one of the Apostles? The same reason names like Matthew, John, Luke and Peter are popular? I bet there were people who thought Matthew was an out-there name back in the day.", "YTA \n\nNot the best response even if you think it\u2019s outdated.\n\nNickname option: Bart", "YTA for so many reasons:\n\n1. Having her name the baby without you being involved at all. He's not even born yet and you're already checking out of being a responsible father.\n2. Agreeing to let her name the baby when even though you have strong opinions about names and weren't going to accept her choice unless you liked it.\n3. Laughing at her and belittling her.\n4. Massively overreacting to a pretty normal name. I get that you don't like it, but plenty of people would be perfectly fine with a traditional name with lots of normal nickname options like Bartholomew. You're allowed to not like it, but you become the asshole when you start acting like it's obviously ridiculous.", "YTA. First of all, it just isn't that weird of a name.\n\nSecondly, names have cycles and names that 5 - 10 years ago we would have found old fashioned are back in popularity. In the U.S. currently, Attiicus is #4, Silas is #6 and Cyrus is #12.\n\nWhen I was in high school and college, Caleb was a really old fashioned name and people associated it with fire and brimstone religious types. 10 or so years later it was in the 20 most popular baby names.\n\nIt is more likely that you are the one behind the times and not your wife.", "YTA - for laughing not for hating the name. His name will just be Bart, or you could call him Ollie. I understand why you don\u2019t want him named after a Simpson character but you did say she could name him.", "YTA. You agreed to let her name the kid so you gotta accept that there was a chance she'd name them something off the wall. At least the name has sentimental value to her instead of some weird made up shit name.", "You agreed to let your wife name your first born. Clearly your assumptions were off based on your perception of the name. Your wife clearly loves the name and what it means to her and shared it with you in a heartfelt way and you basically laughed at her. \n\nYou could have expressed your thoughts on the name choice in a triad of ways but you're response was cruel \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed to let your wife choose your child's name. Barry Allen is a well loved super hero (The Flash) so it's not like it has any negative connotations associated with it.", "I can't help it.  \n[What's your name?](https://youtu.be/sTKHzjh1mUk?t=109)\n\nYTA, valid to want to have a say on your baby's name and suggesting nicknames, but laughing at your pregnant wife? \n\nNow I'm thinking this sounds fishy....", "YTA. Look, I think you've made a few mistakes here. First off, I do not think it's ever a good idea to give one parent sole responsibility for naming a child. You're supposed to be a partners, it should be a joint decision imo.\n\nThat aside onto the main issue. You seen how excited and happy your wife was about this name. Yet you thought it was a good idea to laugh in your face.\n\nYou're about to be a father. Please,  for the sake of your son if no-one else, grow up.", "YTA, laughing is a reaction you can't control,  but the rest is not cool. You shouldn't have agreed to let her name the baby without veto otherwise. And last I checked your logic for why she should get to pick the name hasn't changed. \n\nAlso, like, don't know if you noticed. Being pregnant is a time when her hormones are all of whack, and when women can be extremely sensitive. After learning about such a deep familial connection it was really shitty not to at least back pedal a bit. \n\nAlso, what a childish way to express that your wife spoke to her dad when she was deeply upset.  Told on you? What are you 7?", "YTA. Please do apologise to her, can\u2019t imagine how bad she must\u2019ve felt to see your reaction. Bartholomew is a great name, sure, it\u2019s a bit old-fashioned, but what\u2019s wrong with that? Bart is quite a good nickname for that, but perhaps try and keep your dislike for the name to yourself. She didn\u2019t need you to laugh at her, but you did it anyway, so at least try not to do that around your son in the future when his name is mentioned", "NTA\n\nInsist upon the middle name being Maverick.", "I would have laughed too.\nYour son is going to bart .\nAnd it reminds me how Homer Simpson decided on Bart's name (he was trying to see what rhymes with the name and got tired at the letter B).\n\nYou might be a little bit of an asshole but so is your wife for not discussing it with you to get approval or your two cents on it even if you gave her the final say.\nIt's your kid too.\n\nAnd as a mother of two myself names are to be agreed upon by both parents.\nHer name can be attached as middle name and you both can agree on a daily first name you both can live with.\nThat way the kid will know you mean business when you middle name him that he is out of line with such a serious name.\nESH", "NTA I immediately thought of Bart Simpson and chuckled myself. It's a fine name but The Simpsons has been around forever and it's pretty much permanently associated with Bart now. You did agree to let her name the baby and it's her Grandpa's name so going back on it would make you an AH. However, you're not an AH for laughing at the name. It caught you off guard and is associated with one of the most recognizable TV characters in the last 30 years. Laughing is almost expected.", "NTA, you (unwisely) agreed to let her pick the name but if she picked something so ridiculous that it sounds like a joke it\u2019s normal to laugh you aren\u2019t to blame (is she a white female with glasses working on a masters degree and likes Hillary Clinton? If she doesn\u2019t like cats is she a small poodle mix type?)\n\nYour son, unless he\u2019s very soft, will hate it and request everyone call him by his middle name so pick a good one\n\n*its a good name for a wizard", "YTA, You agreed and then made fun of her grandpa's name.", "YTA", "YTA. As for the nickname, call him Bart, which is short for Bartholomew. Not that outrageous of a name.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that would have been my first choice, but:\n\nHave you considered that she has a sentimental attachment to that name?  Have you considered that she\u2019s maybe going to be a little emotional, you know, because she\u2019s pregnant and all?  Have you considered that she was really excited and you were an insensitive jerk.  \n\nEven if she wanted to name the baby R2-D2, you shouldn\u2019t have laughed in her face.\n\nAnd to decide that you won\u2019t keep your given word about letting her name it.  Really not a stand up move.", "YTA - don't agree to the rules if you're not going to support your wife for her choice, and worse yet, mock her for it.", "I\u2019d say YTA, but an unintentional one\u2026\n\nNow that I think about it that should really be an option on this sub. UAH or something\u2026\n\nYou cannot help an honest reaction. But that doesn\u2019t mean that honest reaction did not hurt. \n\nThat being said, I personally think that, knowing there was a potential for this to happen, given how old school the name is, maybe the wife should\u2019ve brought it up before, even despite the agreement for her to solely name the kid. That was a mistake though, not specifically a jerk move. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably need to apologize and talk it out. If she\u2019s dead set on the name though, then let me add \u201cBarty\u201d to the list of potential nicknames.", "Bort", "Who\u2019s family follows each other on Reddit?

However, you told her she could choose the name. When she chose the name, a name with a deep emotional connection to her, you laughed in her face and tried to get her to change it.\n\nAnd how could you not instantly think of \"Bart\"?", "You agreed, so YTA\n\nShould\u2019ve gone for her choosing a short list of 5, you get to cross 2 off and she chooses from the 3 left. That way she gets to choose the name but you can avoid something that you think is a car crash.", "Okay, tbh, I would also have thought that that name is a joke so I get you BUT...yeaa, YTA.\nYou handled it really badly and should apologize for laughing and humiliating her as the name clearly has a lot of meaning to her. Maybe, after you have begged her forgiveness you could try to talk w her about this, bc as cool as an unique name is, it is somewhat annoying to be the kid w a weird name.", "I actually really like the name, it has a very fantasy vibe to it. \nAlso I\u2019m going to go with mildly YTA, you agreed to let her name your son and then are trying to go back on it. I do think names should be a two yes\u2019s, 1 no situation, so mostly it was a silly thing to agree to if you weren\u2019t cool with her choosing a crazy/fun name.", "YTA for that reaction, geez.

And, who knew, the name of a character in The Simpsons, known by the nickname of Bart.\n\nAren't you aware that names go in cycles? It's really common for 'outdated' names to become fashionable again. I think Batholomew is distinguished and cool myself. \n\nYou need to stop taking this as a joke. You belittled her grandfather, her judgement, and her choice - it turns out it was a only a choice if you liked the name. It's your own ignorance that makes Bartholomew seem a bizarre name.

Can you compromise and make Bartholomew his middle name?", "ESH. I narrowly avoided being named something heinous by my father (in his one useful act of my childhood) vetoing my mother\u2019s intention to name me after her favorite great aunt. You should not have told her she could name him whatever she wanted, that\u2019s just dumb. Laughter would have been my first response too so I can\u2019t blame you for that but you could have gotten it together much faster when you realized she was serious.

So my (35M) wife (32F) is pregnant. She\u2019s due in 2 weeks and i am beyond excited because this would be my first child and I\u2019ve always wanted to be a dad. Yesterday, we were in bed together, talking about our baby. All of a sudden she jumps up excited with a huge smile on her face. She told me to stay on the bed because she had a surprise for me. She went into our closet and grabbed a box. It was decorated with ribbons and bows so I assumed it was a gift for me. She handed it to me with the same big grin on her face. It was obvious she was excited to see me reaction. I asked her what it was but she just kept on saying \u201copen it open it!\u201d I opened it and inside was a blue onesie with the name \u201cbartholomew\u201d in cursive stitched on the middle. Now, I had agreed that I\u2019d let my wife name the baby since she was the one giving birth and I felt as if it would be something really special for her so I trusted she\u2019d name my son something at least normal.

She got really silent and started tearing up. When I noticed this, I sat up and stopped laughing. She snatched the box off me and stomped back to the closet. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. Apparently she\u2019s decided to name our son after her grandfather who she was very close with before he died. I told her that she should think about this because it\u2019s an \u201coutdated\u201d name. She started yelling at me saying I was judging my son before he even came out the womb. She stormed out and is now staying at her moms. I honestly can\u2019t believe she\u2019s serious. Her dad called me yelling at me because apparently she\u2019s told on me. I\u2019ve been called immature and a joke so far. I\u2019ll probably just apologize but there is no way in hell I\u2019m calling my son by that outrageous name.

I\u2019d think she was kidding too! You\u2019re absolutely NTA here, even though it wasn\u2019t the brightest idea to give away all say in naming. In my humble opinion, Bartholomew makes a lovely (if not slightly extra) middle name, so let\u2019s hope you can find a compromise there. A first name in 2023, however? Not so much. Subs like r/NameNerdCircleJerk exists for a reason my friend, and a baby boy named Bartholomew would be a prime target.

Please do your best to make sure your son doesn\u2019t have to go through the awful experience of not feeling like you\u2019re actually yourself- like the name you\u2019ve been given belongs to a different person.
