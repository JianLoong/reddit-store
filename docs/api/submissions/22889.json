I'm the second oldest, I have an older sister Marina (50F), and a younger sister Helen (46F). \n\nAround five years ago, Alex's ex-wife Natalie (47F) cheated on him and they split up. It was a very sad situation as Alex adored his wife, but she wanted someone who was present more as he is a heart surgeon and his job is demanding. \n\nAround this time, Alex started to struggle with mental health problems and went down a dark path for about a year. He hired a housekeeper, Sara (18F at the time 23F) now who fired after only three months. Back then he claimed it was because he didn't want to be lazy and he wanted to take care of his own cleaning/cooking, but we recently found out that it was because he got her pregnant but he didn't believe the child was his. He refused to do a paternity test and essentially left that poor young girl to fend for herself. His excuse was that she was a recovering addict and he was ashamed that he had gotten involved with her, but I don't understand why he would have hired a recovering addict in the first place if that was going to be such a big deal with him.\n\nSomehow, he recent got back into contact with her and found out about his four year old son. He panicked about it and told the family. He said that he was going to send child support and see his son weekly, but that he wasn't going to introduce the boy to his 14 year old twin daughters with Natalie and that the boy wasn't going to be a part of our family holidays. He introduced Sarah to our family and although she seems fine now, she struggled a lot when he abandoned her as she had no friends or family to support her. Her situation reminded me of how we grew up when our father abandoned our family and it made me sick to know my brother had done the same.\n\nI told him that it was wrong for him to treat his son like a dirty secret just because he's embarrassed about how he behaved. I host all family holidays and gatherings because no one else is organized enough  and I said that I wanted to see my nephew there or I would stop hosting because that child deserves to know where he came from. My mother and older sister agree with me, but Helen and Alex are calling me the asshole for trying to 'dictate' how he handles his life.

However, in situations like this one has to think of what would be best for the kid and that is actually hard to predict here. Would he be better off being raised by his mom with child support and minimal contact with a father who potentially sees him as a liability. Can it be emotionally damaging for him to be placed in situations like big family gatherings where he can see and feel the resentment of his father and of potentially some other members of the family? Is he going to hear slander about his mom? Also, we don't know how Alex's daughters would react to the existence of a half brother. Will they be kind and understanding about it? All in all there are possibilities that more contact with Alex and your family may have the opposite effect than what you are intending and make him feel unwanted. On the other hand if his mom still has addiction problems and there is not much of a support system it might be in his interest to know other family like you from whom he can seek help in emergencies etc. It's hard for strangers on the internet to suggest the right course of action but you can take into account all that you know and carefully consider what is the best way to ensure support for this kid.", "YTA Your mom is right you cannot dictate how he handles his life.\n\nhowever that is your nephew.

It sounds like he had a huge trauma, acted out, and then couldn't deal with his own ugliness, and then did a horrible thing that he's basically doubling down on now. The age difference, the vulnerable state of Sara, and the fact that he was her employer all speak terribly of him and he knows it.\n\nBut the damage is done in terms of his reputation in the family. Everyone knows and the only redemption is to start acting like a grown man. If he doesn't like the nephew being invited, then he doesn't have to go. It's his choice to face this either as a responsible adult or an ashamed middle-aged pervert who uses his power to fuck a vulnerable teenager.

IMO though, it would be much better for this little boy to grow up knowing his dad's family has his back even if his dad sucks.\n\nI agree that saying his brother has to bring the kid is probably not going to do much, but I think OP would absolutely be justified in saying \"I will invite my nephew and his mom to my holiday celebration and anyone who has a problem with this can go somewhere else\"", "The brother is a bad person. He took advantage of a very young and vulnerable woman and then abandoned her to raise HIS child alone with no family or financial support. He\u2019s a lousy, rotten, shitty excuse for a human. \n\nNTA OP stand your ground.", "We are talking about her nephew, of course it's her business.", "Invite the kid and his mom. Then tell your brother that they're coming and he is free to not attend. \n\nMy uncle hid a child for 22 years, and this is exactly how we handle events in our family. Uncle is an ass, his kid is very much not an ass.", "That\u2019s bs.. I would never want to associate myself with someone who abandons their child.  I happy he hold his feet to the fire..", "No.  A lot of kids are shy and not really interested in strangers especially if it would be without a close buffer.  I speak from experience.\n\nThings like \u201caunt\u201d or \u201ccousin\u201d don\u2019t have inherent meaning unless taught to.  If he doesn\u2019t have lots of extended family, or does but zero relationship with them, may be pretty words with no personal meaning.\n\nAlso it\u2019s an aunt.", "Also-she absolutely can!  But better be prepared for when they do.  People can suck.", "Haha shiit, my bad, the sentiment remains the same, though. I'll edit it\ud83d\ude01", "Sorry, but your brother doesn't get to tell you that you can't have a relationship with your nephew. He does not need to approve that. Any relationship you form is outside of his with his son. And it sounds like Sarah can use the support.\n\nYour brother needs to be honest with his children. Sarah has a legal right to child support (she doesn't need your brother to bestow that upon her). Your nephew should not be a secret and the family shouldn't have to be gatekeepers to this secret. \n\n While you can't force your brother to do the right thing, that doesn't keep you from doing it and letting this child know that he is a part of the family.", "Your brother really doesn't have a say in it if the child's mother agrees for you to spend time with her child. \n\nI know this sounds harsh since edits your brother, but why should you respect the opinion of a deadbeat dad who abandons a young teen he knocks up and now wants to treat the child as a dirty secret?", "This has me confused. He doesn't want anyone in the family to know so what custody needs to be sorted out? If your brother ends up with custody or even partial custody, won't his other children find out about their brother?", "Also, if my brother knocked up a girl 20 years his junior who was fresh out of highschool then abandoned her *and* his child, I\u2019d sure as hell be getting involved too. That girl didn\u2019t deserve to be used and abandoned like that. And her son deserves a loving family which OP is happy to help provide. Alex is disgusting for getting involved with an 18 year old when he was approaching 40 himself. Actions, meet consequences. He can lie in the bed he made.", "Have you considered if he won\u2019t tell his daughters they have a brother, he\u2019s not going to send them to Christmas at your house where the brother will be. So if you uninvite your brother, but just know his daughters are not going to Christmas either.", "Your brother is seeing his child, who's 4, every week; he's paying child support; he introduced you to the mother. It sounds like this is fairly recent? What you don't say is:\n\n\nHow much time has HE had to get to know the child before an entire group of strangers are presented to the child?\n\n\nHow much contact the mom wants her child to have with your family. Have you asked her? Has he asked her?\n\n\nAlso, before the child meets the extended family, is there agreement about what the child will hear? Teens aren't necessarily careful. Neither are adults. The mom may be anxious the child will hear about the drug part, etc. She may not want a holiday dinner to be the first meeting. Too many variables.\n\nYour question said you \"demanded\" he....This seems more about your own personl idea of moral righteousness than what is best for the child. \n\nYou are not the sole arbiter of what the right moral compass is all by yourself. Bring in the players that matter.", "How could they test his DNA if your brother wasn't around?", "Op since you host get Sarah s number and invite her yourself as you and the rest of your family want a relationship with her child. Leave your ah brother out of the decision just inform him ahead of the events that Sarah and her son will be there. \n\nYou can't force him to have a normal relationship with his child but you and the rest of the family who wants to have said relationship with him can Independently.", "How does your brother's ex-wife feel about it?  Does she want her daughters to get to know their half brother?", "Then use the older sibling words to get him to see sense. Hiding a child when there is a family that wants the child to be part of it is very immature and selfish.", "If she wants to meet her nephew, that is HER choice", "I made the same mistake on several comments..", "Well said. Thank you. \n\nFinally some human talk.", "she doesn't know yet", "The title is clearly more telling of her controlling nature than the body of the post.  Not hosting the holidays is just an example of group punishment, since not everyone in the family is falling in line with her expectations from him.", "The mother DID have a choice 5 years ago and she chose to have the child, which is exactly the reason that fathers now only have to meet their legal obligations, which OP's brother is apparently doing.  Since having the baby is solely the mother's choice and men get no say in it, it's not at all surprising that they choose not to have relationships with the child.  Would you prefer that the child be forced to be around a man who makes it absolutely clear by everything that he's done and said, that he would have preferred that the pregnancy was aborted?  That seems like absolute cruelty to the child.  Trying to force \"decency\" onto a sperm donor is likely to cause harm and pain to the child, whether OP intends for it or not.  You can't \"force\" a scoudrel to be a good father.", "I \ud83d\udcaf% agree. The kid did not ask to come here but here he is. Just because OP\u2019s brother is the AH does not mean OP has to be. It takes a village to raise a child and if OP is ready, willing and able to step into the role of Auntie then she should.\n\nThe Dad can be a callous AH if he wants but kids need loving family. The Mom has suffered enough by being cast away alone and pregnant. \n\nOP: NTA", "So, what, then?  You're planning on telling her or you're going to let her daughters tell her after the first family gathering where they meet him for the first time?!?", "\"Her controlling nature \"\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 people like you are a freaking riot. Seriously. But hey, if demanding your own brother be a decent person is controlling oh well I guess.", "Honestly mother did not have a choice.\nAbortion is not magic to make the zygote disappear.\nThere are more risks in abortion alone than bringing a pregnancy to term. It is like saying she had choice to commit suicide. So why do we blame a ethical and moral choice as low and poor.\n\n( while a women can decide to abort, it is her choice.\nWhen she decides not to abort, it is not entirely her choice because it wasn't her choice to get impregnated)\nThis in brackets is general statement not for this post.\n\nNo one is forcing father. In OP's story, the brother disclosed the truth to family, but deciding secret or deception. \nHow did they reconnect.\n\nAfter all this, why abandon? Does that offer a context...\n\nIn this case OP'S brother not a scoundrel, not a father... but he is father to other children. \nThat is discrimination.", "You can't say the girls will be happy, you don't know that. What we do know is that he was single when he slept with her so he needs to own what happened because really, the only crap he deserves is for bailing on a young girl he was sexually involved with when she had no other support after taking advantage of his position of power.\n\nOP, NTA for the morals, but check the kid and mum even want that first, please!", "Finally, someone sensible..thanks", "People who believe that they can use whatever means necessary to force grown adults to behave as they demand aren't funny at all, unfortunately.  Peace out.", "[removed]", "This post is loony tunes", "One realistic response,  You are right, OP cannot offer what she cannot sustain on the long run.\nHowever, there should be some justice..\n\nYeah, the girls may be happy  ( i wanted to type 'may be' not will be ).
