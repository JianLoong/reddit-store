I'm the second oldest, I have an older sister Marina (50F), and a younger sister Helen (46F). \n\nAround five years ago, Alex's ex-wife Natalie (47F) cheated on him and they split up. It was a very sad situation as Alex adored his wife, but she wanted someone who was present more as he is a heart surgeon and his job is demanding. \n\nAround this time, Alex started to struggle with mental health problems and went down a dark path for about a year. He hired a housekeeper, Sara (18F at the time 23F) now who fired after only three months. Back then he claimed it was because he didn't want to be lazy and he wanted to take care of his own cleaning/cooking, but we recently found out that it was because he got her pregnant but he didn't believe the child was his. He refused to do a paternity test and essentially left that poor young girl to fend for herself. His excuse was that she was a recovering addict and he was ashamed that he had gotten involved with her, but I don't understand why he would have hired a recovering addict in the first place if that was going to be such a big deal with him.\n\nSomehow, he recent got back into contact with her and found out about his four year old son. He panicked about it and told the family. He said that he was going to send child support and see his son weekly, but that he wasn't going to introduce the boy to his 14 year old twin daughters with Natalie and that the boy wasn't going to be a part of our family holidays. He introduced Sarah to our family and although she seems fine now, she struggled a lot when he abandoned her as she had no friends or family to support her. Her situation reminded me of how we grew up when our father abandoned our family and it made me sick to know my brother had done the same.\n\nI told him that it was wrong for him to treat his son like a dirty secret just because he's embarrassed about how he behaved. I host all family holidays and gatherings because no one else is organized enough  and I said that I wanted to see my nephew there or I would stop hosting because that child deserves to know where he came from. My mother and older sister agree with me, but Helen and Alex are calling me the asshole for trying to 'dictate' how he handles his life.

However, in situations like this one has to think of what would be best for the kid and that is actually hard to predict here. Would he be better off being raised by his mom with child support and minimal contact with a father who potentially sees him as a liability. Can it be emotionally damaging for him to be placed in situations like big family gatherings where he can see and feel the resentment of his father and of potentially some other members of the family? Is he going to hear slander about his mom? Also, we don't know how Alex's daughters would react to the existence of a half brother. Will they be kind and understanding about it? All in all there are possibilities that more contact with Alex and your family may have the opposite effect than what you are intending and make him feel unwanted. On the other hand if his mom still has addiction problems and there is not much of a support system it might be in his interest to know other family like you from whom he can seek help in emergencies etc. It's hard for strangers on the internet to suggest the right course of action but you can take into account all that you know and carefully consider what is the best way to ensure support for this kid.", "YTA Your mom is right you cannot dictate how he handles his life.\n\nhowever that is your nephew.

It sounds to me like you're seeing the situation for what it is. His behavior was repugnant, and he probably knows it, so that all he sees when he thinks of his son is his own shame. That's not fair to anyone -- not even himself.\n\nI would definitely recommend urging your brother to seek therapy. It sounds like he had a huge trauma, acted out, and then couldn't deal with his own ugliness, and then did a horrible thing that he's basically doubling down on now. The age difference, the vulnerable state of Sara, and the fact that he was her employer all speak terribly of him and he knows it.\n\nBut the damage is done in terms of his reputation in the family. Everyone knows and the only redemption is to start acting like a grown man. If he doesn't like the nephew being invited, then he doesn't have to go. It's his choice to face this either as a responsible adult or an ashamed middle-aged pervert who uses his power to fuck a vulnerable teenager. He gets to decide who he is now.", "You don\u2019t have a consistent story here.   You say he fired her because she was pregnant and he didn\u2019t believe it was his.
