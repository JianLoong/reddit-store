I'm the second oldest, I have an older sister Marina (50F), and a younger sister Helen (46F). \n\nAround five years ago, Alex's ex-wife Natalie (47F) cheated on him and they split up. It was a very sad situation as Alex adored his wife, but she wanted someone who was present more as he is a heart surgeon and his job is demanding. \n\nAround this time, Alex started to struggle with mental health problems and went down a dark path for about a year. He hired a housekeeper, Sara (18F at the time 23F) now who fired after only three months. Back then he claimed it was because he didn't want to be lazy and he wanted to take care of his own cleaning/cooking, but we recently found out that it was because he got her pregnant but he didn't believe the child was his. He refused to do a paternity test and essentially left that poor young girl to fend for herself. His excuse was that she was a recovering addict and he was ashamed that he had gotten involved with her, but I don't understand why he would have hired a recovering addict in the first place if that was going to be such a big deal with him.\n\nSomehow, he recent got back into contact with her and found out about his four year old son. He panicked about it and told the family. He said that he was going to send child support and see his son weekly, but that he wasn't going to introduce the boy to his 14 year old twin daughters with Natalie and that the boy wasn't going to be a part of our family holidays. He introduced Sarah to our family and although she seems fine now, she struggled a lot when he abandoned her as she had no friends or family to support her. Her situation reminded me of how we grew up when our father abandoned our family and it made me sick to know my brother had done the same.\n\nI told him that it was wrong for him to treat his son like a dirty secret just because he's embarrassed about how he behaved. I host all family holidays and gatherings because no one else is organized enough  and I said that I wanted to see my nephew there or I would stop hosting because that child deserves to know where he came from. My mother and older sister agree with me, but Helen and Alex are calling me the asshole for trying to 'dictate' how he handles his life.

However, in situations like this one has to think of what would be best for the kid and that is actually hard to predict here. Would he be better off being raised by his mom with child support and minimal contact with a father who potentially sees him as a liability. Can it be emotionally damaging for him to be placed in situations like big family gatherings where he can see and feel the resentment of his father and of potentially some other members of the family? Is he going to hear slander about his mom? Also, we don't know how Alex's daughters would react to the existence of a half brother. Will they be kind and understanding about it? All in all there are possibilities that more contact with Alex and your family may have the opposite effect than what you are intending and make him feel unwanted. On the other hand if his mom still has addiction problems and there is not much of a support system it might be in his interest to know other family like you from whom he can seek help in emergencies etc. It's hard for strangers on the internet to suggest the right course of action but you can take into account all that you know and carefully consider what is the best way to ensure support for this kid.", "YTA Your mom is right you cannot dictate how he handles his life.\n\nhowever that is your nephew.

That's not fair to anyone -- not even himself.\n\nI would definitely recommend urging your brother to seek therapy. It sounds like he had a huge trauma, acted out, and then couldn't deal with his own ugliness, and then did a horrible thing that he's basically doubling down on now. The age difference, the vulnerable state of Sara, and the fact that he was her employer all speak terribly of him and he knows it.\n\nBut the damage is done in terms of his reputation in the family. Everyone knows and the only redemption is to start acting like a grown man. If he doesn't like the nephew being invited, then he doesn't have to go. It's his choice to face this either as a responsible adult or an ashamed middle-aged pervert who uses his power to fuck a vulnerable teenager.

His wants and opinions are not worth paying attention to.", "I made a policy years ago which is that don't keep secrets for bad people. I will not be complicit in lies, deceptions or other behavior. Of course I have a couple of evil siblings that I now have zero relationship with (I have a great relationship with others), so maybe don't take advice from me! I have a clean conscience though.", "That\u2019s not always the best solution for the kid. Do you really think he needs constant reminders about his dad and that side of the family? It seems aunt benefits more than the kid here, which is the problem. OP is trying to assuage their own guilt about the situation. Kid is better off living his life with his mom.", "Title of the post say \"demanding\" that's dictating not taking a stand. You can take a stand but you can't force what other people do even if they are wrong. \n\nLike you can't force someone to take their meds if they don't want to even if they really should take their meds and taking it is for their benefit. But if they do not want to, that is their choice.", "Op and her family can give the kid a family all she likes. I still maintain that she can\u2019t force her brother to be a father if he doesn\u2019t want to.  The child deserves a father that loves him not one that don\u2019t want him. The kid is better off with no father than one that resents him or one that goes in and out of his life", "I believe they\u2019re talking about their specific situation, not the situation OP is talking about", ">My alternative would be to uninvite him\n\nYou don't have to uninvite him. You can let him know that your nephew and the boy's mom are invited, and if he isn't ready to face the reality of what his family actually looks like then he doesn't have to attend. \n\n> but then his daughters will want to know why their father isn't there. He's refusing to tell them that they have a brother too.\n\n\"Your father is only starting to take responsibility for certain past actions. Until he has fully addressed what happened and made things right, he is not comfortable attending family events.\" \n\n>The child has no other family. The mother doesn't speak to her family so it's always just them during the holidays. From what I can understand, the mother's family are horrible people as well so I want the boy to experience the love of an extended family gathering together to celebrate.\n\nThat's another very good reason to reach out to your nephew's mother directly. If you can build a relationship with her (independent of what your brother does or doesn't do), she can be a part of the family in her own right. And that means your nephew can be properly welcomed instead of hidden away like a dirty secret.", "I'm quoting them. I completely agree with you.", "Gotcha, bad joke btw much respect for standing up for the child. You're clutch.", "Cutting my brother off would be very tricky so I'm hoping he cleans up his act real soon. It's definitely a possibility though", "Did you read the post? After abandoning them OP\u2019s brother got back in touch with them and then did the DNA test", "I'm seriously confused too. I asked if he meant visitation but he insisted it was custody. My working theory is that he's gonna try something stupid like alternating weekends or something", "You don\u2019t know that at all, it\u2019s also completely possible he could use the support of his dad\u2019s side of the family - their love, their time, their resources.", "My nephew's mother is a recovered addict. She got pregnant during recovery and used her child as motivation to stay clean. We live in the US and I seriously doubt it'll affect my brother's custody of his daughters.", "That's literally not what they said. They said they didn't understand why he hired someone in recovery if it mattered that much to him.", "He\u2019s getting \u201cresources\u201d from child support. As far as love, it appears the family is divided so while some may show him affection, others will not and that will be hard on him. Not to mention his dad has made explicitly clear that he\u2019s not interested in a relationship. \n\nI think OP should leave it alone. She can send the mother a nice note letting her know OP is always there if she needs to talk but inviting him into family events that her brother- the kids father- doesn\u2019t want him at is a bad idea.", "Fair enough, that's how I read it. I could be wrong.", "But they were extremely clear in their wording. They don't have any ill will towards the girl for being in recovery, they're angry at their brother for coming up with a bs excuse and calling out the brother on it.", "You are wrong. I have no problem with him hiring someone who was recovering. My issue is with him later using that against her and as an excuse for his abandonment of her.", "We don't know where OP lives, so the mother might very well not have had a choice since there are plenty of places where abortion is illegal.", "Not really, especially not in the English speaking world.  https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-abortion-is-illegal", "She doesn't owe her shit brother anything at all, and group punishment is a perfectly fine way to get people to behave like drcent humans - for example, law is one such thing. If you X, Y will happen.", "She said that English isn't her first (or even second) language, so I'd say it's fair to assume that she is not from the English speaking world. We exist.", "LOL"]}
