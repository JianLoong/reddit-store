Next year, we will be travelling to meet my extended family.\n\nA little bit of background, my parents are from France and they moved to the US before I was born. I never learned French because I found it boring and then as an adult I found it difficult. Languages are just not my thing but I know that they come easier to other people.\n\nWendy already speaks Spanish fluently even though no one in her family does. And she\u2019s now learning Korean. So I asked her to start learning French before she meets my family. And she refused. I said that languages are easy for her and she should do it so my family likes her.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and shes not doing it. And I\u2019ve called her an asshole, told her she knows how difficult learning languages is for me and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her.\n\nShe said no, that she didn\u2019t have the time. I said that she had the time to learn Spanish to watch telenovelas and that she has the time to learn Korean to watch Kdramas so she definitely should have the time to learn French to speak to my family. If she can do it for such silly reasons, she should certainly do it for something so important. \n\nShe told me to learn it myself and called me an asshole.\n\nShe ignored my for a few days and we met yesterday. I started the topic again hoping she cooled down and she refused again. I was mad, I told her she didn\u2019t respect me nor my family and asked he could she expect to be part of my family when she refuses to speak our language.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy and told me to g f myself.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m wondering if I was in fact an asshole. Perhaps I should\u2019ve been more understanding and give her time to realise she had to learn French.\nAITA?\n\nEdit: people seem to be misunderstanding. I don\u2019t expect her to become fluent in a few months, I want her to at least start learning so she can know the basics.", "created_utc": 1670595982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgyp5y/aita_for_expecting_my_girlfriend_to_learn_french/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not fair to pressure or manipulate her into doing something that she doesn't want to do, and calling her names or threatening to exclude her from your family is not an appropriate response. Instead, try to have an open and respectful conversation with her about the importance of learning French to you and your family, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.

Next year, we will be travelling to meet my extended family.\n\nA little bit of background, my parents are from France and they moved to the US before I was born. I never learned French because I found it boring and then as an adult I found it difficult. Languages are just not my thing but I know that they come easier to other people.\n\nWendy already speaks Spanish fluently even though no one in her family does. And she\u2019s now learning Korean. So I asked her to start learning French before she meets my family. And she refused. I said that languages are easy for her and she should do it so my family likes her.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and shes not doing it. And I\u2019ve called her an asshole, told her she knows how difficult learning languages is for me and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her.\n\nShe said no, that she didn\u2019t have the time. I said that she had the time to learn Spanish to watch telenovelas and that she has the time to learn Korean to watch Kdramas so she definitely should have the time to learn French to speak to my family.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and called me an asshole.\n\nShe ignored my for a few days and we met yesterday. I started the topic again hoping she cooled down and she refused again. I was mad, I told her she didn\u2019t respect me nor my family and asked he could she expect to be part of my family when she refuses to speak our language.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy and told me to g f myself.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m wondering if I was in fact an asshole.

But she should do it because then she can translate it.", "The \"our\" language part made me laugh.\n\nMy fathers side of the family is bilingual, I only speak one of the languages they grew up with (my native language) and the other one  while I can somewhat understand it will never be \"my\" language. I can't imagine asking someone to learn the language I don't understand while I don't even know it.\n\nYta op.", "This guy is freaking incredible. And the only reason he wonders if he is an asshole is because  he wonders if he should have given her time to realize that she HAD to learn french. This guy is probably already single lol.", "Only phrase she needs to learn is ex petit ami.", "True. French and Spanish are very close languages. She might (if great at languages) be able to do it in six months. \n\nThe OP is still TA though, especially since he\u2019s taking her someplace where he should know the language and is planning on using her as a translator. I mean, really?", "The audacity of OP!!", "\u201cwhen she refuses to speak OUR language\u201d \nnice. yta, op", "That bold text and capitals \u2764\ufe0f. Agree with this 100.", "Good French! Not sure why but this is the exact sentence almost every non French knows.", "Op doesn't even know French.", "Connard (I guess dick-person is the best translation I can think up of) vs canard (duck). Both are masculine.", "I once dated a Deaf person (he grew up hearing and became Deaf around college). I took ASL to make communication easier for him (he could lip read but that's not ideal). I went to his extended family's Christmas party and I was the only one there who could even remotely sign with him. Even his parents. They kept looking to me (my first time meeting any of them besides his parents and only had taken ASL 1+2, so by no means fluent) to interpret for him. He had been Deaf for about 15 years and not one of them took the time to learn how to communicate with him. \n\nThis guy is TA for so many reasons!", "Fun fact: connard like the feminine version connasse is derived from the word con which is modernly used to mean 'idiot' but in old french means cunt/pussy.", "I think you\u2019ll find this is the case in many families. Sad but true.", "Honestly they are even bigger ahs than this guy because at least OP's parents had the option to learn English as well as OP had the option to learn French. The guy in your story could *only* communicate with ASL and I guess writing in English.", "I'm sure. But that doesn't make it less dickish.", "I'm guessing his parents do know English otherwise he would speak French being raised in an all French household. That's how immersion works. This is his extended family, who may not live in an English speaking part of the world.\n\nAnd, no, the guy in my story could speak and lip read. ASL was easier for him. \n\nOP is the only AH in this story.", "I agree."]}
