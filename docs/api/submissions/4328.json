Next year, we will be travelling to meet my extended family.\n\nA little bit of background, my parents are from France and they moved to the US before I was born. I never learned French because I found it boring and then as an adult I found it difficult. Languages are just not my thing but I know that they come easier to other people.\n\nWendy already speaks Spanish fluently even though no one in her family does. And she\u2019s now learning Korean. So I asked her to start learning French before she meets my family. And she refused. I said that languages are easy for her and she should do it so my family likes her.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and shes not doing it. And I\u2019ve called her an asshole, told her she knows how difficult learning languages is for me and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her.\n\nShe said no, that she didn\u2019t have the time. I said that she had the time to learn Spanish to watch telenovelas and that she has the time to learn Korean to watch Kdramas so she definitely should have the time to learn French to speak to my family. If she can do it for such silly reasons, she should certainly do it for something so important. \n\nShe told me to learn it myself and called me an asshole.\n\nShe ignored my for a few days and we met yesterday. I started the topic again hoping she cooled down and she refused again. I was mad, I told her she didn\u2019t respect me nor my family and asked he could she expect to be part of my family when she refuses to speak our language.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy and told me to g f myself.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m wondering if I was in fact an asshole. Perhaps I should\u2019ve been more understanding and give her time to realise she had to learn French.\nAITA?\n\nEdit: people seem to be misunderstanding. I don\u2019t expect her to become fluent in a few months, I want her to at least start learning so she can know the basics.", "created_utc": 1670595982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgyp5y/aita_for_expecting_my_girlfriend_to_learn_french/", "score": 826, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not fair to pressure or manipulate her into doing something that she doesn't want to do, and calling her names or threatening to exclude her from your family is not an appropriate response. Instead, try to have an open and respectful conversation with her about the importance of learning French to you and your family, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.

Next year, we will be travelling to meet my extended family.\n\nA little bit of background, my parents are from France and they moved to the US before I was born. I never learned French because I found it boring and then as an adult I found it difficult. Languages are just not my thing but I know that they come easier to other people.\n\nWendy already speaks Spanish fluently even though no one in her family does. And she\u2019s now learning Korean. So I asked her to start learning French before she meets my family. And she refused. I said that languages are easy for her and she should do it so my family likes her.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and shes not doing it. And I\u2019ve called her an asshole, told her she knows how difficult learning languages is for me and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her.\n\nShe said no, that she didn\u2019t have the time. I said that she had the time to learn Spanish to watch telenovelas and that she has the time to learn Korean to watch Kdramas so she definitely should have the time to learn French to speak to my family.\n\nShe told me to learn it myself and called me an asshole.\n\nShe ignored my for a few days and we met yesterday. I started the topic again hoping she cooled down and she refused again. I was mad, I told her she didn\u2019t respect me nor my family and asked he could she expect to be part of my family when she refuses to speak our language.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy and told me to g f myself.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m wondering if I was in fact an asshole.
