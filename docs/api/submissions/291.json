Instead of kind of trickling a little bit all through the night, it seems like he manages to stay dry for 70-90% of the time, and then once during the night he pees all at once.\n\nThe problem is, there seems to be NO consistency on what time of the night this happens. I've seen it happen an hour after he going down to bed...but also seen it happen at 4-6AM. There's no rhyme or reason to it.", "I'm an idiot...I looked at one, a moment ago--saw that there was padding across the entire thing, and assumed that meant = unisex/evenly padded throughout.\n\nHaving just done exactly as you mentioned though, you're 100% correct. There IS padding along the entire thing, but the center/back parts are \\*noticeably\\* less thick than what's up in the front.\n\nMy guy sleeps (mostly) on his belly. But I've noticed that his pull-up is *still* noticeably wet towards the back usually. Interesting.", "I remember using some of those liners, years ago in school for a chemistry class! I forgot they existed! That is a GREAT idea, I\u2019ll look into getting some today!\n\nThey actually had (have?) overnight diapers on sale at the store down the road from me in his size. But I was concerned because they seem to be ACTUAL diapers that close up on the sides etc. I\u2019m not entirely sure if he\u2019d care about that or not.", "As of right now, he puts on his pull up by himself while I\u2019m getting out his PJs for the night. So it\u2019s very possible that we\u2019re running into that exact issue. \n\nNot to mention, he wriggles around at night like you wouldn\u2019t believe. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019d be overstepping a privacy boundary to ask him to make sure he\u2019s pointing in the right way? That would be a fairly easy quick fix, I\u2019d imagine.", "Interesting!\n\nThe ironic thing is she occasionally has been known to buy him pink clothes in the past. Never made a fuss of it then. \n\nI never really got into watching MLP myself, but not because I have any problem with it. I just don\u2019t really tend to watch much TV/shows in general anymore. \n\nIf nephew likes it,  and it\u2019s a decent enough show for kids. Then as far I\u2019m concerned, he can watch it all he wants! I especially don\u2019t care if they happen to be on his pull ups.", "NTA just her getting them in a size smaller is ridiculous- sounds like he\u2019s associating the pattern with the comfortability.\n\nMy kid preferred the pampers ones waaaay more, they were more stretchy/soft; generic pull-ups have just not got on the ball yet with not having that crumpled feeling.", "The noticeably wetter could just be the different absorbency rates (check after a couple minutes to see if all liquid is absorbed - this can be done after you change him) or it\u2019s a sign the child should be moving up a size* or you\u2019ll risk leaking. \n\n*based on my incredibly scientific study of 1 lol", "I like the pull ups, less hastle but they are more expensive. I'd definitely want the night ones either way... Day time ones just aren't as absorbent", "We've actually had occasion to use both kinds/brands in the ***same*** night very recently, and nephew flat-out told me the \\*forbidden\\* ones do a better job of holding in wetness.\n\nETA - I was going to hold back on details, but since you're a parent as well...what the hell. He woke up and discovered he was in the middle of peeing (I suppose that's what woke him up?). Jumped up, and ran to the bathroom--and was done peeing by the time he got to the toilet. We didn't have any of the pampers ones in that particular bathroom at the time, so he just put on what WAS in there at the time when he changed out of his wet pull up.", "Unfortunately, I\u2019m all but certain he\u2019s already wearing the largest size they make (5T-6T). He\u2019s a scrawny little guy, but is relatively tall for his age. We may end up having to hunt for another option in the near future. \n\nThat makes my wallet/bank account very, very sad lol\u2026", "We\u2019ve never tried the night specific pull-ups! That will almost certainly be our next purchase. \n\nDo you think they\u2019re comparable to an overnight diaper, in terms of leak stopping ability? Despite the subject of this thread, little man is generally NOT picky on what he happens to be wearing. So we\u2019re able to try out whatever works, most of the time.", "My son is 7 and very occasionally will wet the bed still- not often enough that it makes sense to put him in a pull-up every night though (But he did wear them a little past the outlier time, like your nephew- NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THAT). Night urination is a very hard thing for some kids to stop. \n\nI definitely noticed a big stride in how often he would wet his pull-ups once he had a good couple months of daytime underwear. Learning to hold your pee during the day, in order to get to the bathroom, trains their bladder so that they then do wake up when they\u2019re peeing just because it becomes ingrained to not instantly release. My son took about 6 months I\u2019d say? If your nephew wakes up more to pee at night, I would consider switching entirely to underwear and then protect the bed instead of the child from pee lol. \n\nMy method was a waterproof mattress cover, make sure it repels and doesn\u2019t just absorb- those ones tend to stain and hold smell (the only upside is it doesn\u2019t spread as much, but I found those broke down quickly and started leaking to the mattress). Then I would put down the washable bed pads, use the fitted sheet to hold those into place. Then you put down the disposable bed pads that you can stick to the sheets (unless it\u2019s fleece, they come off without tape residue). I preferred the quilted ones since they wouldn\u2019t tear while my kid was asleep and moving- Walmart has their own brand pack for a little under $10 that is hands down the best one for absorption. Use the disposable and washable bed pads to keep any leakage to a minimum (like a kid sleeping at a weird angle off the pad).", "If you aren\u2019t using them already, maybe try overnight pull ups (goodnites)? They\u2019re generally just the slightest bit thicker all around than regular pull ups.\n\nOtherwise, bambo makes overnight pull ups for kids up to 15. I\u2019ve never used that brand though so can\u2019t weigh in with thoughts there.\n\nI wish your wallet luck lol.", "Yea, overnight diapers help with leaking compared to day diapers. No difference between night diapers and night pullups, just how you put them on. But, I think the weight range is almost always to high, and so I go to the next range a few pounds early/once leaks happen.  And sometimes you have to switch bands. Some are better for chubby leg, some are better for skinny bottoms, etc, but it's just trial and error.", "I'm going to just leave a link to the [Lil helper lifesaver mat](https://au.lilhelper.co/products/lifesaver-mat) here. They're a wonderful company, and as a grown woman who basically haemorrhages every month, I can tell you that these mats are *perfectly* named. If they can handle *my* overflow, I'm sure they can be used for this, which I'm pretty sure was their original purpose anyway! \n\n(For the adults, I'll just say that I was introduced to these at a ... \\*meaningful look\\* *party*, and it made clean-up 100% easier - just chuck it in the washing machine and done!)", "I\u2019ve actually walked right past these before and completely blanked on buying them. As long as they make them in a size to fit him, I\u2019d be very interested in giving them a try! \n\nI suspect we\u2019re nearing the point where the pull-ups he\u2019s using now simply won\u2019t cut it, absorbency wise. Last night just about confirmed that."]}
