Make sure your mom understands that it has nothing to do with how much he loves her. They will be singing a different tune when he can't remember their names either.", "NTA but your half siblings are. It is known, that Alzheimer patients forget the latest memories easier and earlier than the older ones. So this has nothing to do with their mother but just with the illness itself. My grandmother forgot where she lived for more than 50 years and started to walk to her childhood home a few towns away.   \nYour half siblings are disgusting. But if they feel this way, you might uninvite them from every family activity in the future - or threaten to do so. Because they show how little they care and think about you, your mother and your sister", "Hey, if it takes brain damage for someone to love them, that's sad enough that they burned themselves.

You follow your heart and hold close your memories and honour your Dad.  In the end that what matters.  Good luck, friend.", "NTA it's terrible what you are going through, Alzheimer's is no joke.  I'm sorry you are going through this and eventually he will forget them too.", "NTA\n\nThose people are toxic and immature.", "NTA what is wrong with these people? Your mom and your siblings care for him every day and they, grown up people, are treating them like this? So sorry for you, they are disgusting, i think you had the right to defend you mom.", "NTA. Your half siblings sound like hateful, horrible people.", "NTA using your father's condition to make such points it's. just. dreadful.", "NTA I'm sorry about your dad it's really tough to have a sick family member and even worse when they forget you. Your half siblings can be as smug as they like but sadly he'll forget them too somepoint. They sound like very insecure people to need severe Alzheimer's to make them feel loved and superior. They are horrible people not for wanting to be loved but for manipulating a sad situation as a way to feel better than instead of offering mutual support. Fuck them OP. Focus on you, your mum and your dad, don't deal with the half siblings anymore than needed. Your dad loved you and your mum and you will always know that, remember your dad as the person he was not the way he is now.", "This is a tough one with some details left out. I find it hard to believe these half siblings have known your mom since being children and dislike her for no reason. Did your mom treat them differently than you and your full siblings? Regardless I feel for them considering their whole family imploded with their moms death then not too long afterwards dad found a replacement. If anything your dad is TA\u2026 these half kids seem to have never healed from thinking their mother was replaced and ultimately that is his fault.", "Your half siblings had no ability to consent to your mothers intrusion into their lives after the loss of their mother. They still grieve for their mother and love their mother. That was their real family. The only reason your dad married their mother was because his first wife died. Of course it makes them happy to know that he always loved and still loves her. \n\nThey enjoy watching your mother in the pain that she caused them when she took over their father and their lives.", "Tough situation  \n\n\nI'll go NAH and let me explain:\n\nThere is to little info that tells me that the halfsiblings are purposly bullying OP: Yes they talk about it, and maybe to much but OF COURSE they do: it's their dead mother of whom they hear all the stories, of course they simile over the talk. That does not make it nice for OP ofc. i think it is just perception and loosing someone to alzheimers is hard.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is sick, and they are accomodating him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"and how could they hate my mom so much\" .. they very likely have good reason for that. -**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
