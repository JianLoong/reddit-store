They will be singing a different tune when he can't remember their names either.", "NTA but your half siblings are. It is known, that Alzheimer patients forget the latest memories easier and earlier than the older ones. So this has nothing to do with their mother but just with the illness itself. My grandmother forgot where she lived for more than 50 years and started to walk to her childhood home a few towns away.   \nYour half siblings are disgusting. But if they feel this way, you might uninvite them from every family activity in the future - or threaten to do so.

Your mom and your siblings care for him every day and they, grown up people, are treating them like this? So sorry for you, they are disgusting, i think you had the right to defend you mom.", "NTA. Your half siblings sound like hateful, horrible people.", "NTA using your father's condition to make such points it's. just. dreadful.", "NTA I'm sorry about your dad it's really tough to have a sick family member and even worse when they forget you. Your half siblings can be as smug as they like but sadly he'll forget them too somepoint. They sound like very insecure people to need severe Alzheimer's to make them feel loved and superior. They are horrible people not for wanting to be loved but for manipulating a sad situation as a way to feel better than instead of offering mutual support. Fuck them OP. Focus on you, your mum and your dad, don't deal with the half siblings anymore than needed. Your dad loved you and your mum and you will always know that, remember your dad as the person he was not the way he is now.", "This is a tough one with some details left out. I find it hard to believe these half siblings have known your mom since being children and dislike her for no reason. Did your mom treat them differently than you and your full siblings?

If anything your dad is TA\u2026 these half kids seem to have never healed from thinking their mother was replaced and ultimately that is his fault.", "Your half siblings had no ability to consent to your mothers intrusion into their lives after the loss of their mother. They still grieve for their mother and love their mother. That was their real family. The only reason your dad married their mother was because his first wife died.

There are words I want to use but I can\u2019t because they\u2019re beyond the scope of civil. \n\nKeep losing it on them. Keep reminding them they are indeed disgusting. Tell the whole family how they\u2019re using a disease to feel validated and also school them on what Alzheimer\u2019s really is. That for their dad to be lost in his own mind brings them joy. Because that is what Alzheimer\u2019s is: they\u2019re a prisoner of their own mind. And let me tell you OP: your dad knows what\u2019s going on and I am sure it\u2019s breaking his heart to see you and your family hurting at the hands of his first born children. He just can\u2019t defend you and he\u2019s at the mercy of a disease that is ruthless.
