So who he \"loves more\" is really up for debate, since their brain pathways are still squeaky clean, meaning they're far less used in his mind.\n\nI'm probably butchering the description, nobody come at me, but that's how it was described to my family when my grandmother went through dementia.", "N.tA. Just give it time, he\u2019ll forget them and their mom as well. I mean it\u2019s Alzheimers\u2019, there\u2019s nothing to celebrate, there are no winners. I\u2019m sorry you, your sister, mom and dad have to live through this. It\u2019s a terrible disease. Give him a big hug if you can. My mom died of Alzheimers\u2019 January 1st last year. I miss her every day. I wish you the very best.", "Wow, no NTA for sure.  They are disgusting.   I can't believe they are finding pleasure in this... plus, how short sighted are they?   Soon it'll be them that is forgotten...", "NTA\nIt never ceases to amaze me the way some people get pleasure in hurting others, especially those that have loved and cared for them. Your half siblings are horrible for this.", "This is so true my friend\u2019s mother had Alzheimer\u2019s and my friend would go every day to visit her and she would call her by her sister\u2018s name. She didn\u2019t even remember her daughter. When my friend would come she would say it was so glad that \u2013 Sister\u2018s name \u2013 was there and when were they gonna go to lunch. I did hurt my friend a lot. She could remember things from 50 years ago but not anything from Two weeks ago. It\u2019s very sad disease", "NTA. Your half siblings are being very weird and petty. \n\nMy grandpa and I were total buds when I was growing up. I lived with my grandparents for a little bit, and I visited them all the time once I could drive. \n\nThen Grandpa's Alzheimer's got really bad. He was put into a nursing home.  I went with my mom to visit him and he kept comparing the young, black nurse to my mom. My mom is white. My grandpa had no idea who I was and started hitting on me. \n\nHow are your siblings going to act if or when your dad acts like that? They have a serious misunderstanding of how this disease is and can affect people. And they're being super gross about it. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this on top of watching your father struggle with this, OP.", "I am so sorry that you're having to go through this terribly painful experience which is being exacerbated by some issues in the family system. I would suggest seeing a family counselor to see if they could help your siblings to understand how the situation is impacting everyone and possibly understand how their behavior is being perceived.", "NTA\n\nThis is just the way Alzheimer\u2019s IS. It doesn\u2019t mean anything about who loves someone more or less. People forget the past and then the present. My grandpa forgot my name sometimes but he still loved me and I could tell he knew who I was! He just used his other granddaughters name to refer to me, but it makes sense because she was born 10 years before me. Some people with Alzheimer\u2019s become very rude or violent or combative or racist- that doesn\u2019t men that\u2019s who they ARE, it\u2019s the disease. Your steps are assholes.", "YNTA your half siblings are the asshole. Your Dad is victim of dementia and they're using it to validate themselves instead of empathising with your Dad and the family at how difficult it is for everyone. \nYeah it's nice to reminisce, but they shouldn't be using it in a snide way to one up you, your sister and Mum. If they ever loved you like family, they'd be there for you all, and try and coax some other memories from your Dad.\nSo sorry you went through this. \nAnd it's shocking that they're not looking after him, yet are taking all the \"glory\" from him remembering them and not you.", "My uncle forgot me when he developed alzheimers, I was one of the youngest cousins so that wasn't surprising at all, he definitely remembered the older people in the family. OPs half siblings are disgusting. As if it wasn't bad enough that their mother is having to take care of her husband while watching him become a shell of who he was, the kid's that she loved and helped raised are rubbing it in her gave that he can't remember her. What a rotten thing to do to something who's watching their husband die a slow and terrible death.", "OP should find some this research and share it with half siblings \n\nNTA- Just because he got remarried doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t still have live for the wife who passed and his current wife. It sounds like they should have had therapy after their mother passed and that they never supported his remarriage unfortunately", "For real, I'm tearing up at the restaurant thinking about this tragic situation and how one of my family members is at the start of this kind of thing, and these horrid people are using it as an own. Disgusting.", "And uneducated, it\u2019s likely dad will forget about them too. \n\nNTA", "Just as an example.  I lived really far away while my grandmother got much worse.  When she went into hospice I went home to be with her... she didn't recognize almost anyone or anything by then.\n\nI walked in the door and she lit up and said \"hey, you!\"  It was HER.  She recognized me!   It drifted away after just a few seconds and she was gone again, and there was some jealousy that she recognized me so distinctly.  But I wasn't normally there, so I guess those pathways weren't all broken down yet.  I got one solitary moment that I'll remember forever because of it.  But it didn't mean she loved me less/more at all.  I guess my arrival was enough to break her out of the fog for a moment since it wasn't \"normal.\"", "After my dad's stroke, he didn't remember me and my mom anymore, at least the part where he and my mom had been married and had me.  He only remembered her from before they started dating.  And could not remember me at all.\n\nThere's no going back after something like that, OP, their sibling, and their mom better cut their losses soon enough and look after themselves, preferably now, because those older half-siblings are going to act like vultures when they can. good riddance to them; they're out of my life after dad died.\n\nThere's no going back after something like that, OP, their sibling and their mom better cut their losses soon enough and look after themselves, preferably now, because those older half-siblings are going to act like vultures when they can.", "My grandma had dementia and my aunt took care of her until she passed.

After he woke up, he kept asking his wife why his mother and sister hadn't come to visit him in hospital, and every time, his wife would have to tell him they were dead, and he would be distraught and mourn them as if it had just happened. Then, a few hours later, he would forget and ask again. It was terrible. Thank goodness that, eventually, his memory began to recover, because it was really taking a toll on both of them.", "My grandmother had a serious bran aneurysm and the only person she remembered was her own mother. She kept calling my aunt (her daughter) mom. We were fortunate in that she got some of her memories back when she healed from that aneurysm, but it took some time. She had a necklace made with the names of her grandkids on it to help her remember us.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s different when the person will recover, like from a surgery, but with dementia\u2026you don\u2019t need to tell them that a loved one died. They won\u2019t remember long, and it will be distressing while they do. It\u2019s okay to lie.", "Also, windows. Being in a room with a window might help- not all rooms have them and having trouble keeping track of time (day/night cycle) can be incredibly agitating and disorientating to someone who's already struggling.", "My grandma was sure I was one of her sisters toward the end. She could never place which one, but the family resemblance was strong and I was the right age (in her mind) so i must be a sister. \n\nIt was actually a bit of a bright spot for me to see a side of her I didn't know as well. She would giggle and gossip with me about people long dead and seemed to have a great time. The only down side was that she kept lapsing into German which I don't speak.", "My great aunt thought I was my dad. I'm female but I do look a LOT like him.", "Like were they expecting you to upset her? Because her \"sister\" not remembering any of the stuff she was talking about would have been incredibly upsetting.", "My grandfather thought I was his niece. I was just so happy he remembered I belonged to him in some way. He always knew I was some sort of relative and was always happy to see me which made me happy. \n\nNTA at all.

Your half siblings are foul by the sounds of it, how dare they treat their loving step mother snf half siblings like this? It sounds like 20+ years of pent up rage that their father remarried. Horrible that they are using this difficult time to hate on you and your mum. Half siblings deserved what you said and more.", "NTA. Your half siblings very much are though. My grandpa forgot me, my dad and my mom, and thought I was my aunt. That didn't mean he didn't love his son (my dad) or I, it's just the way the illness took his mind. My grandma was the same. She gradually forgot newer people in her life, then older people, until she didn't remember anyone at all. My mom (her daughter) was \"that nice lady who takes care of me\". I didn't even register unless I was actively talking to her. \n\nYour siblings are showing an appalling lack of compassion. They are allowed to be glad their dad loved their mom, but this isn't about that. It's about showing you and your mom they view you both as inferior replacements. They are very much AHs, and the sad thing is that soon enough they will be in your shoes and your dad will forget them as well.\n\nI'm so sorry for all that you are going through. Alzhimers is a horrific disease that strips us of ourselves. Getting it is my worst fear, and I have a family history on both sides. What you are experiencing now is horrible, and the pain of watching someone you love slip away mentally while physically being healthy is indescribable. Please know that nothing your dad says or does under the influence the disease means he does not love you or your mom, or loves you less than his first wife/kids. It's just the cruelties of his disease that has taken his mind captive, and I'm sure he would be so sad to see what his kids are doing to you if he was in his right mind.", "NTA. They won't be laughing when he forgets them.", "NTA.  They're cruel.  All that is happening memory wise is that your dad is regressing through his memories.  My grandmother did the same and the only person she eventually remembered was my baby cousin before she was eventually in a vegetative state. \n\nIt sounds like they are enjoying the cruelty.  I am truly sorry you are having to experience that, and I'd venture a guess, your father would be as well.", "NTA. As others have pointed out, the things that Alzheimer's patients do and don't remember have nothing to do with who they loved most or when they were happiest. In general, they tend to forget newer stuff first and older stuff last. It's not at all surprising then that your dad forgot about his newer wife before the older one. \n\nWith regard to your stepsiblings, do you and your mom depend on them to help with the caregiving? If not, I'd suggest letting them know that if they can't rein in the smug and snarky commentary and can't stop making comments about who dad loved \"more\" (not how love actually works...) then they aren't welcome in your home. Your mom is under no obligation to allow people who deliberately hurt her into her home. \n\nIf you do depend on them to help with care, perhaps its best if you and your mom and sister aren't around them when they are over.", "This is a new low for humanity, emotionally weaponizing Alzheimer's.

They had to call paramedics that night just to try and get her to lay in bed. He had a nervous breakdown after because of how much it hurt him that he wasn't even recognizable to his own mother. Yes we make jokes about her finally having something to blame her cooky personality on, but I would NEVER even think about saying anything of her memory.\n\nOp, call them out on how comically stupid it sounds that they have to use his disease to say he's picking his favorite wife.", "NTA. Your half siblings are terrible people. \n\nI'd cut every contact you have with them and when your dad forgets them too, maybe they'll see how awful they were.", "NTA Theyre not glad your dad loves their mom, theyre glad your dad has forgotten you and your mom. Theres a difference", "NTA your half-siblings are terrible and don't care for you, your sister, or your mother. They also clearly don't know how Alzheimer's works as someone with it can forget the people they love most because they met them the latest.

I always made sure to tell him: I\u2019m never mad at you, I\u2019m mad at the disease that took YOU away from ME. I always had to let him know that. \n\nI miss him so much. This post really breaks my heart because no one really knows how heartbreaking Alzheimer\u2019s really is unless someone they love is suffering from it.
