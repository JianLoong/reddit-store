He said at the moment, $50 + snacks. So I gave him $50 to take his siblings to Barbie, and the ten year old and I watched Oppenheimer. Turns out Oppenheimer is an hour longer than Barbie, so when their movie ended, my son called my wife to come pick them up.\n\nWhen I got home, she was pissed at me. She said she couldn't believe I fobbed off two of our kids on our oldest so I could watch what I wanted to watch. I pointed out that I paid him, and she said the fact I think that makes a difference shows there's something wrong with me. I said we would have been watching different movies regardless, the only difference is who got which movie, and he set his price. She doesn't care and said I'm a huge asshole.

We walked out, I explained my discomfort and he agreed with me, I opened the app, saw there was an IMAX screening next door with lots of opening seats that was about to begin, so\u2026 we just walked in there and sat down. 100% worth it, nobody booked that seat last second or anything and I got to actually enjoy the movie (with elbow room!).

You SHOULD take an interest in history, world history. Something that changed the face of the planet, irreversibly, forever. It's not a small aspect of US history.

Embrace the spirit.\n\nHoly shit how are people so invested in BS marketing campaigns. Consuuuuuuume.", "I'm surprised the 10 year old was interested. That movie is 99% dialogue and 1% action. Wonder what he thought of the movie lol", "Except mom had to pick the kids up early (one of which is a 4yr old!) because dad was too busy to watch them...like he presumably agreed he would when he took them all to the movies while mom was busy. Thats the fatherly responsibility he is pawning off.", "It wasn't gory, it was still graphic. But thanks for proving my point that people are so desensitized to disturbing imagery they think it's fine to show a child with no context.", "YTA just for taking a 10 year old to Oppenheimer. That movie is absolutely not for kids. \n\nYou\u2019ve already heard everything there is to say about the other stuff.", "NAH.\n\nI think your wife is right that as the parent you shouldn't care which movie you watch and you should just go wherever you are needed. The way you did things makes it look like you wanted to see Oppenheimer so you paid your son to do the parent job, and it's kind of like you made it about your fun more than about the kids' fun.\n\nHOWEVER making $50 for watching a movie is a great deal so it's understandable your son would rather have $50 than see the movie he wanted to see.\n\nBut also 13-year-olds are old enough to babysit so you could have offered her the deal.\n\nBut also Barbie is PG-13 as someone else said so maybe you need an adult to take a 4-year-old in there.", "I don\u2019t think YTA because you took a ten year old to see Oppenheimer. You get what you get. I watched movies similar as a kid. \n\nI don\u2019t even think YTA for paying the 17 year old. He named his price, and it\u2019s enough that he can go see Oppenheimer and maybe have something left over. \n\nI do think YTA for not looking at run times and inconveniencing your wife, though.", "YTA. You\u2019re a parent but didn\u2019t really act like it on that evening. Planning things out would lend a much better result.", "ohhh no barbie is pg13 shiver my timbers megan", "I took a 5-year old to see Barbie. There is one bleeped curse word and not even a kiss. No nudity. No real violence. There is one car chase, one silly chase on foot, one silly fight with beach toys and suction cup bow and arrows. There is one mention that barbie and Ken do not have pen1s and vag1na. I have no idea why the movie is pg-13. It had less crass content than The Grinch or Shrek. \n\nI would have taken the whole family to see Barbie, but I do think Barbie is made for all ages and fine for any child who can sit for 2 hours. I would assume it was rated PG based on watching it. I am also suspecting that some of the moms in my mom groups who are saying it is too crass for kids have not actually seen it. Some of the things that I have seen mentioned as inappropriate made no sense after watching the movie.", "He got 50 dollars to watch his siblings at the movies. Everyone else got to see the movie they wanted he was forced into Barbie when he wanted to see Oppenheimer", "I watched r movies as a kid and look how I turned out", "Oh noooo that poor boy \ud83d\ude22 like he had a choice too, and your telling me you wouldn't watch barbie for 50 dollars and free food? Like that's crazy to me I'd do that in a heartbeat", "He was asked what the going price would be, then told that he was doing it after. \n\nHe never volunteered or offered to do it. Simply supply the going rate.", "Sounds like he offered him 50 dollars to watch a movie. Good offer. Even if he made him do it for 50 dollars. That's like 25 an hour, that's money. I feel like you definitely came from a silver spoon thinking like this cause I grew up poor I'd shit myself I could get paid 50 to watch a movie. Get some perspective.", "Oh yeah the abundance of silver spoons in childhood. The one I held while I waited to see if everyone got to eat. \n\nThe one I held when all my cloths were hand me downs that had at least two owners before me. Etc.\n\nI didn\u2019t say one word about the amount or if that was a reasonable price. \n\nWhat I said was that one kid was forced into labor, while everyone else got treated to the movie they wanted to see. That is Not fair. And the kid is owed the same consideration as his siblings.", "Ohhh wahhh poor you. There was black mold in my showers and no food you dont see me being dramatic about it. He ain't get forced dad seems reasonable I'm sure he coulda just said no. And if you were soooo poor how can you not see how amazing of a deal this is \ud83d\ude2d 25 an hour to watch barbie sign me up!"]}
