It sounds like she was trying to intimidate you by yelling at you about her problem of inviting too many guests.  She should have asked first and is embarrassed that you called her out on her rude behavior.  \n\nAs for her Guests not moving after being politely asked to move; I personally would have called the police or local parking enforcement and explained that there were unauthorized vehicles on your property.  Depending on the city laws and ordinances they'll give out citations, or at least make people move their cars if the owners of said cars can be located.", "NTA\n\nYou warned them.  Call a tow truck.  Or just park in such a way that you completely block in these people in your driveway., so that no one can pull out.   \n\nPut in earplugs and go to bed.", "NTA and you should definitely have these cars towed since putting them on your property creates liability for you as the homeowner.", "It's not your problem her driveway is too small.  She didn't ask your permission and it's your property.  Get the cars towed. NTA", "NTA you were nice and she wasn't. Time for a sign that states they will be towed if they park there.  Next party tow them. You can be nice and let her know your drive way is off limits in case you need to leave your house for any reason you need access etc. I can't believe how rude she was. The guests should move when asked. I'd even make notes that say something about being towed and place it on their windshield.", "Try \"Hey Siri, find \"tow trucks near me\" while standing there with your neighbor and her guests.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nJust get them towed.", "NTA - that\u2019s probably trespass and it\u2019s not her business how much space you have to yourself, the point is that it\u2019s your space and not hers.\n\nShe neglected basic courtesy here by not asking, and is clearly banking on you feeling that because she\u2019s older and has her friends backing her, you won\u2019t know what to do and will just continue to allow this.\n\nIt would be a real shame if you spilled some sharp objects over the end of your drive before her guests leave; or if some friends of yours were to come over and park her guests in so they couldn\u2019t get out after the party\u2026", "NTA.  I live in an area where parking is tight.  Whenever someone is having a party or guests and need extra parking, they always ask if they can use neighbors driveways and neighbors are generally accommodating if they don\u2019t need the spaces themselves since they may need to borrow spaces themselves some day. \n\nHowever, you always ask permission first since you never know when there might be conflicts.", "NTA, you need to have these interlopers towed next time.

Put up a sign if you feel the need to warn people.  \n\nNo one has a right to park in your driveway.", "NTA. Next time call the police to document the trespassing and have them towed.", "NTA Have the cars towed.", "Absolutely NTA.  Call the police.  Have the cars ticketed and towed.", "NTA  - I'm sure your friendly neighborhood tow company would love new business. This may become a regular occurrence, so let them know. I'm sure they would be happy to help!", "Nta, get them towed", "NTA. Call and have the cars towed. They are trespassing on private property. Put up a security camera. It's irrelevant how many people live in your house, it's not up to her how much space you need and it's not her property to allow people to park there.", "NTA.

Have you talked with any other neighbors and asked if this is typical behavior for this woman and what they may have done to keep her from abusing their property?\n7. You do realize that this woman will have other parties and will still feel entitled to your driveway, don't you? You should not do her any favors while she has this attitude.

No.  That wasn't gonna happen.\n\nI bought a few extra metal fence posts, and used the post driver to surround his truck. He couldn't move his truck until I moved the posts. I then called the sheriff's dept to issue No Trespass orders.. the deputy laughed, and said he liked my new fence location.\n\n He never parked on my land again.  \n\nDon't mess with a farm girl.
