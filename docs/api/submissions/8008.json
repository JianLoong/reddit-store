It sounds like she was trying to intimidate you by yelling at you about her problem of inviting too many guests.  She should have asked first and is embarrassed that you called her out on her rude behavior.  \n\nAs for her Guests not moving after being politely asked to move; I personally would have called the police or local parking enforcement and explained that there were unauthorized vehicles on your property.

Next party tow them. You can be nice and let her know your drive way is off limits in case you need to leave your house for any reason you need access etc. I can't believe how rude she was.
