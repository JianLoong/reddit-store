Your son has a different role in your hearts and lives and always will. Your wife is in your life because you chose her to be and to build a relationship with a grown adult woman who came into your life as an independent person with her own thoughts, feelings and aspirations. Your son is in your life because you chose to bring a person into the world that you can nurture into an empathetic, funny, intelligent, caring person in society.

Tread carefully as you move forward, kids are more perceptive than you think.", "NTA. The whole \u201ckids are the most important thing\u201d is a thing a lot of teenagers say because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been told by their parents (understandably so). The truth of it is, one person is your chosen life partner, and it\u2019s not the kids. Your partner should come first because eventually, if you do your job right, your kids move on and have their own partners/families. The idea being that it will then be you and your partner. Not to put too fine a point on it, but kids are meant to be temporary immediate family members. That\u2019s a good thing and it\u2019s the goal. If a partner mistreats them, you have an obligation to protect them and fix that situation, but you aren\u2019t required to consider your kids the most important people in the world. That mindset creates parents who can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not healthy that they ruin all of their adult child\u2019s relationships, won\u2019t let them choose their own career, tell them how to raise their own kids. It\u2019s much more healthy to love your kids, and have your own dreams and goals and life plan with your actual life partner.\n\nEdit: As for your son knowing or not knowing about this reality, he\u2019s 10 right now so you don\u2019t need to sit him down and explain any of it, and hopefully your mother won\u2019t either, but as he grows it should be something he understands. When you\u2019re little, your parents are your whole world and it doesn\u2019t even compute how you wouldn\u2019t be theirs, but as you grow up you\u2019ll start to see and naturally want to forge your own path. It\u2019s a developmental step for a reason. You wouldn\u2019t want him to put you guys before his future partner, and seeing a healthy relationship between you guys where you put each other first is a positive thing. In my opinion of course. When he\u2019s more mature, if he asks, I think it\u2019s reasonable to be honest.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing it right. The best thing a person can do for their children is love their spouse. \n\nBy loving your spouse you are teaching your child every day. You are teaching your child how to be a great spouse and how to set an example for their own children.", "My husband is my soul mate and I also can't put into words how much I love him, but I'd still push him in front of a bus before my kids and he would do the same to me.  \n\nIt's a different love, but its up to you if you want to playing a weird game of who you love first and second.  I imagine your son probably loves you second too.", "Honestly I do think YTA for ever saying this outloud to anyone other than your wife when you two are sure no one else is in your house, including your son.\n\nYou can't control your feelings so you arent an A for them, but you can control your actions and who you describe your feelings to and when, is an action.\n\nIn practical reality, your son only had two chances to be someone's most loved or equal most loved person in his developmental years, you and your wife. He lost both chances. He is no one's most loved person, while you and your wife are probably his two equally most loved people. Your mum may say he's hers most loved person, but he doesn't live with her, she isn't raising him. \n\nYou may get lucky and your mum never repeats this and your son never finds out.\n\nYou may get lucky and if your son does find out, he will be ok with it or even agree with you that spouses should be loved more than children.\n\nYou may get unlucky and he will feel insecure, unsafe and like you don't love him at all (untrue but it may be how he feels). He could start getting scared if there is a fire you two would save each other over him. He could start thinking you consider him a burden and don't want him around when it could just be you two alone together.\n\nI don't think the risk you took of being unlucky was worth it in this case.\n\nEdit: lol downvotes but all the NTA comments are about him not being the A for his feelings and ignoring the actual issue, which is if OP is the A *for telling his mother*.\n\nI even agreed he wasn't the A for his feelings.", "You are definitely TA", "No you aren\u2019t .

It's natural to have a different sort of love for your romantic partner than for anyone else. It's also normal for the sort of love you have for a child to change as they grow and mature.

It's not like Dad was saying ranking multiple children and saying he loves one child more than another child, or some random colleague's kid more than his own kid. This child only comes second to OP's own beloved WIFE, and that seems a pretty intimate and natural flow of things. If only wish more kids in the world had parents with such good marriages. If my parents had told me they loved each other most or in a special way, and that us kids were also dearly beloved yet in a secondary way, I honestly don't think I'd be \"heartbroken\" but just would think that kind of logical.

Oh no wait that's easy - my wife, then my son, then my grandma and our pets, etc.\") that I tried not to think about, but the more I considered it the more I realized it was right, but I don't want it to be right.

I adore them both, and yes the precise types of love are different, but when the thought came to mind I was able to compare and determine who I love more. I would rather not have, but such is the nature of intrusive thinking.", "Huh, that's a super interesting and sad post you shared! But I don't think this OP here is necessarily doing the same thing.\n\nOP here seemed to be talking mainly in a kind of emotional/philosophical tenor and I didn't get the impresion that OP is creating situations of leaving the kid out or relegating to the kid to some secondary sphere. It sounded to me like OP just emotionally loves his wife in a special way (that linguistically he's calling 'first'), but is fundamentally loving them both within a singular family sphere.\n\nIn the other post, it seems the parents kept ditching the kid to go on vacations without him, and going on date nights without him most every weekend. Yikes! So there, it really does seem like the parents relegated the kid to the outside of family life in actual temporal and geographic ways to a very weird and extreme extent. In that case, the kid really was some kind of second-class citizen in the family, and that the parents didn't do much beyond feed and clothe him before they ran off to play just to the two of them.\n\nDefinitely an interesting/sobering read!!!! Sometimes I worry about parenting and whether I'm doing a good enough job -- and then I read these posts about nutty people like these parents ditching their kid for all these long multiple vacations every year, and I feel like I'm not doing so bad in comparison LOL.

If his son was older/an adult I think that\u2019s a completely different thing, but for many children I think it\u2019s hard for them to imagine loving anyone more than their parents so I think it would be difficult to hear. It changes though once they experience having feelings for others etc and you realise your own parents aren\u2019t the ones you love the most anymore. Just my opinion anyway \ud83d\ude02", "For me it would be a bad thing for a child to know their parents love each other more than the child, because children are dependant on their parents while adults are self sufficient. \n\nCould make the child feel very unsafe/insecure when the people they rely on to survive love each other more than them.\n\nPlus parents generally love their children equally or more than their partner, which was also true for the parents of the parents.\n\nSo the child/children now know they are no ones equal most loved on the planet.\n\nWhile their parents are at least their partners most loved person, and likely their own parents most loved as well. Could make the child/children feel very lonely and sad.\n\nEdit: oh and there is another reason it would be bad. The parents are probably the child/children's most loved people in the world. So the child/children will know that is unrequited.", "I don\u2019t think the love should be compared at all. They are two different kinds of love. That require different things of you.

I don\u2019t think we need to turn it into a love heirarchy.", "In my mother and father's defense, I am a very anxious person about many things that don't involve them at all too. \n\nThen again, one could argue that they might have played a hand in that to start with.", "I don\u2019t think you are wrong for thinking it. I do think you are a little bit misguided in thinking that they can be compared in the first place. Loving a spouse and loving a child are two completely seperate things and require different aspects of yourself. I think you are giving too much headspace to an intrusive thought. Intrusive thoughts aren\u2019t necessarily true and you and your mother are beating yourself up over a thought that on further examination shouldn\u2019t have any real world value because as I said the love is different.\n\nA spouse is someone you choose to raise a family with. Your child is a being placed in your care that you are raising to eventually be independent. Those are two completely different goals and as such different types of love.", "I agree, he's not necessarily doing the same thing, but plenty of parents think they're doing the right thing and then wake up down the line with a host of complaints from their children (ask any mom who has had to reckon with putting their pre-teen child on weight watchers in the mid 2000s). \n\nI merely shared the post as a way for OP to reflect on if him and his wife are being fully honest with themselves about how they put their child first.", "Thank you for posting this. That whole saga is just heartbreaking (on the son's behalf - I can't fathom how his parents can be that dense). \n\nI can very confidently say that my wife and I attend to our son's emotional needs far more than that, and that we genuinely love and enjoy bonding with our son. \n\n(As an aside, I can't believe what the father mentions about leaving him out to cry as a toddler because they wanted to finish having sex, having been in that position, I can't understand how the desire to finish a single sex session would overtake the need to comfort one's child, especially that young!)", "You need to actively work on separating the two versions of love. The love you have for your son and the love you have for your wife *are* equal and they are both number one in their own right. You need to keep repeating that to yourself. \n\nBut I would take a harsh look at how this perceived idea that your wife is first trickles in to how you care for your son. There's a great comment on the post I sourced, where the commenter said parents need to be both providers and present for their kids. Take stock of how you are both a provider and present for your child.", "Exactly, it sounds like you have a lovely family dynamic that is perfectly healthy for your child. Don\u2019t listen to the nonsense.", "She won't. She herself emphasized that he could never know this, and I agree with her on that wholeheartedly. She might not have been a great mother to me, but she is a great grandma.", "Yeah, that makes sense. Little kids can be pretty literal and clunky in their interpretations", "I actually disagree a bit. Love, at its core, is comparable because it drives one to want the same things for the person you love. You want different things with them, but in the end, I want intense happiness, content, and a life with much support for everyone I love to a degree I do not ever think of for people I don't. I do think that you're otherwise right, though (but to be completely frank, this intrusive thought is correct, I think). I certainly do need to work on managing my intrusive thoughts though.", "For sure, this is good high quality stuff to think about.", "I just think never tell anyone else about you loving your wife more, hope your mum doesn't either, and don't take edibles around her again haha.\n\nYour son might be ok with it if he finds out, but he might not and if he isn't, it's not worth the risk.", "Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it.", "I disagree. I think there are multiple types of love and they don\u2019t need to be compared. What benifit does comparing your love of your wife to your love of your son bring you? Why do you need to compare them? A spouse and a child are different. Your love for them shouldn\u2019t be exactly the same. They are too different.", "I don't think they need to be either - it would be best if they weren't - I'm just saying that it is possible. \n\nI do think that I should not do that though."]}
