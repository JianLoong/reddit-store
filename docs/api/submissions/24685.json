I made it abundantly clear that I adore my son and would never ever tell him that he isn't first. My mother was angry with me for this.

Your son has a different role in your hearts and lives and always will. Your wife is in your life because you chose her to be and to build a relationship with a grown adult woman who came into your life as an independent person with her own thoughts, feelings and aspirations. Your son is in your life because you chose to bring a person into the world that you can nurture into an empathetic, funny, intelligent, caring person in society.

Tread carefully as you move forward, kids are more perceptive than you think.", "NTA. The whole \u201ckids are the most important thing\u201d is a thing a lot of teenagers say because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been told by their parents (understandably so). The truth of it is, one person is your chosen life partner, and it\u2019s not the kids. Your partner should come first because eventually, if you do your job right, your kids move on and have their own partners/families. The idea being that it will then be you and your partner. Not to put too fine a point on it, but kids are meant to be temporary immediate family members. That\u2019s a good thing and it\u2019s the goal. If a partner mistreats them, you have an obligation to protect them and fix that situation, but you aren\u2019t required to consider your kids the most important people in the world. That mindset creates parents who can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not healthy that they ruin all of their adult child\u2019s relationships, won\u2019t let them choose their own career, tell them how to raise their own kids. It\u2019s much more healthy to love your kids, and have your own dreams and goals and life plan with your actual life partner.\n\nEdit: As for your son knowing or not knowing about this reality, he\u2019s 10 right now so you don\u2019t need to sit him down and explain any of it, and hopefully your mother won\u2019t either, but as he grows it should be something he understands. When you\u2019re little, your parents are your whole world and it doesn\u2019t even compute how you wouldn\u2019t be theirs, but as you grow up you\u2019ll start to see and naturally want to forge your own path. It\u2019s a developmental step for a reason. You wouldn\u2019t want him to put you guys before his future partner, and seeing a healthy relationship between you guys where you put each other first is a positive thing. In my opinion of course. When he\u2019s more mature, if he asks, I think it\u2019s reasonable to be honest.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing it right. The best thing a person can do for their children is love their spouse. \n\nBy loving your spouse you are teaching your child every day. You are teaching your child how to be a great spouse and how to set an example for their own children.", "My husband is my soul mate and I also can't put into words how much I love him, but I'd still push him in front of a bus before my kids and he would do the same to me.  \n\nIt's a different love, but its up to you if you want to playing a weird game of who you love first and second.  I imagine your son probably loves you second too.", "Honestly I do think YTA for ever saying this outloud to anyone other than your wife when you two are sure no one else is in your house, including your son.\n\nYou can't control your feelings so you arent an A for them, but you can control your actions and who you describe your feelings to and when, is an action.\n\nIn practical reality, your son only had two chances to be someone's most loved or equal most loved person in his developmental years, you and your wife. He lost both chances. He is no one's most loved person, while you and your wife are probably his two equally most loved people. Your mum may say he's hers most loved person, but he doesn't live with her, she isn't raising him. \n\nYou may get lucky and your mum never repeats this and your son never finds out.\n\nYou may get lucky and if your son does find out, he will be ok with it or even agree with you that spouses should be loved more than children.\n\nYou may get unlucky and he will feel insecure, unsafe and like you don't love him at all (untrue but it may be how he feels). He could start getting scared if there is a fire you two would save each other over him. He could start thinking you consider him a burden and don't want him around when it could just be you two alone together.\n\nI don't think the risk you took of being unlucky was worth it in this case.\n\nEdit: lol downvotes but all the NTA comments are about him not being the A for his feelings and ignoring the actual issue, which is if OP is the A *for telling his mother*.\n\nI even agreed he wasn't the A for his feelings.", "You are definitely TA", "No you aren\u2019t .

It's not like Dad was ranking multiple children and saying he loves one child more than another child, or some random colleague's kid more than his own kid.

If my parents had told me they loved each other most or in a special way, and that us kids were also dearly beloved yet in a secondary way, I honestly don't think I'd be \"heartbroken\" but just would think that kind of logical.

I adore them both, and yes the precise types of love are different, but when the thought came to mind I was able to compare and determine who I love more. I would rather not have, but such is the nature of intrusive thinking.", "Huh, that's a super interesting and sad post you shared! But I don't think this OP here is necessarily doing the same thing.\n\nOP here seemed to be talking mainly in a kind of emotional/philosophical tenor and I didn't get the impresion that OP is creating situations of leaving the kid out or relegating to the kid to some secondary sphere. It sounded to me like OP just emotionally loves his wife in a special way (that linguistically he's calling 'first'), but is fundamentally loving them both within a singular family sphere.\n\nIn the other post, it seems the parents kept ditching the kid to go on vacations without him, and going on date nights without him most every weekend. Yikes! So there, it really does seem like the parents relegated the kid to the outside of family life in actual temporal and geographic ways to a very weird and extreme extent. In that case, the kid really was some kind of second-class citizen in the family, and that the parents didn't do much beyond feed and clothe him before they ran off to play just to the two of them.\n\nDefinitely an interesting/sobering read!!!! Sometimes I worry about parenting and whether I'm doing a good enough job -- and then I read these posts about nutty people like these parents ditching their kid for all these long multiple vacations every year, and I feel like I'm not doing so bad in comparison LOL.

If his son was older/an adult I think that\u2019s a completely different thing, but for many children I think it\u2019s hard for them to imagine loving anyone more than their parents so I think it would be difficult to hear. It changes though once they experience having feelings for others etc and you realise your own parents aren\u2019t the ones you love the most anymore. Just my opinion anyway \ud83d\ude02", "For me it would be a bad thing for a child to know their parents love each other more than the child, because children are dependant on their parents while adults are self sufficient. \n\nCould make the child feel very unsafe/insecure when the people they rely on to survive love each other more than them.\n\nPlus parents generally love their children equally or more than their partner, which was also true for the parents of the parents.\n\nSo the child/children now know they are no ones equal most loved on the planet.\n\nWhile their parents are at least their partners most loved person, and likely their own parents most loved as well. Could make the child/children feel very lonely and sad.\n\nEdit: oh and there is another reason it would be bad. The parents are probably the child/children's most loved people in the world.

The reality is that aside from your parents potentially \"letting this slip\" and hurting your son,  other kids DO TALK and most (good) parents have the \"I love you more than anything\" or \"the love mom and dad have are different than our love and that's okay\" scripts on hand so I am perplexed that you didn't think to prepare that to them rather than being so \"honest\". Next time if you feel like you need to process things like that, try a therapist. I really just hope this didn't backfire and your kid finds out from others before they question you or start to \"feel\" they are #2 in their parents love ranking. \n\nI know what you said IS NOT malicious and I understand that you probably meant it as \"we have a different kind of love\" rather than \"he is #2\" but developmentally your kid may not conceptualize this until years down the road. I find it hard to believe that he doesn't already question it (or intuitively feels this deep down) but even assuming this is the first time you shared this, I hope you have some well thought out plans in case your son ever questions or is told by your parents what you said. If you and your wife truly put him #1, I'm sure the damage would be minimal but even so, it will still hurt him to hear.", "Don't take it too much to heart. You don't really need to work on your feelings like they think you do. It's just a random person's opinion. What matters is your actions.\n\n---\n\n> But it is also not fair for you and your wife to say that your son comes second in love in your life\n\nI think it is unfair to claim this.", "Well, I guess it wouldn't really matter in your scenario, as your child would still end up with someone who loves them second best.", "I agree. When you deeply love someone it seems strange to me to quantifying the mount of love. Of course you can obviously love differently, like a child compared to a spouse but it's all so undefinable. Also I just say that I love my family because my husband, my kid, and I are more than the sum of all our parts.", "Lol, your mom basically told you she loves your son more than you. \n\nI think she\u2019s just upset that you don\u2019t agree. \n\nBut you sound like a great dad and husband!", "A healthy relationship (not necessarily marriage) is the foundation of a strong family, how about that?", "what is your Mom on about? From the moment I was born my Mom and Dad always told me \"we adore you, we've wanted you from the moment we found out about you. But your Mom/Dad, our marriage comes first\".\n\nAnd even at TEN i understood that it wasn't malicious, just that my Mom and Dad put each other first. And as I get older I understand and celebrate it more and more because marriage is HARD. Especially with divorce rates shooting toward the sky, I was grateful to have been born to parents in a world where everyone chooses distraction and temptation; mine choose each other first.\n\nNTA but your mom must've went through some weird stuff if she prioritizes children and grandchildren primarily over her marriage partner. Maybe she doesn't like her spouse as much as you like your wife? It happens.", "NTA. But your mom wasn\u2019t a safe person to share that with. \n\nI was raised in a family where the parents were the center of the family. Our needs were more than met, but our parents\u2019 relationship with each other was the most important in the house. And i raised my kids the same way. \n\nOur job is to raise kids to LEAVE US and find their own lives.", "That is one of those no-win questions that you should never fall for.  Like when two siblings ask their parents who they love most or who they'd rescue if there was a fire and only one could be saved...  NTAH for going off on your mom, just don't fall for this in the future.", "NTA. You might want to be careful who you say that to, though, since a lot of people just freak out over children. But I think it's lovely that you and your wife feel that way about each other.", "YTA. Yikes, as a parent I can't imagine ever loving anyone as much as my child. This way of thinking can easily go toxic if the original relationship doesn't end up working out and you love your new partner more than your child because you think that's how it should be. The new partner wont have the same dedication or love for your child as the other parent and the child ends up feeling like an outsider when their parent should be putting them first.", "I\u2019m not a fan of this concept of loving spouse more than their children.  I can\u2019t imagine my children doing anything that would make me not love them.  I can be angry, disappointed, embarrassed, a whole litany of things, but I\u2019ll never stop loving them.  \nI can think of plenty of things that my spouse could do to make me not live them any more.  \nPut the kids first, love them more than your spouse.  But putting them first doesn\u2019t mean that they come at the expense of your spouse always.  You\u2019re entitled to take time for your spouse and your relationship.  You\u2019re entitled to protect and nurture that relationship too.", "NTA but I\u2019d watch it about saying things like this out loud. Yeah, you\u2019re kid is asleep, but how do you know that for 100% certain? I\u2019ve overheard many conversations I wasn\u2019t supposed to between my parents even when I was young bc they thought I wasn\u2019t there or asleep.", "> ESH she was wrong to put you on the spot but you do realize that you don't have to say exactly what you think.\n\nRight?  Just fucking lie, who cares?", "I think it\u2019s one thing to phrase things a certain way in your head but then you edit it for outside consumption. Love is not a contest and you shouldn\u2019t ever express it that way. \u201cMy wife is my soulmate, I love her with every fiber of my being\u201d \u201cI adore you son and feel so lucky to have you. There\u2019s nothing that compares to having you as my son\u201d You can express that you love them both deeply \u2014 there\u2019s no need for comparative terms and you should scrupulously avoid them. Also in your mind, it may help to think of it as living them differently rather than more or less. How you love a wife is different from how you love your child inherently.", "My mom explained that to me when I was about 8-9 years old. She told me her, partner first, children later, parents third and siblings fourth. And to me that made total sense (especially the way she explained it). She told me that when I grow up, look for a partner who has the same values. My relationship with my mother is perfect, I feel very loved, I don't see how that can hurt a child if that child is treated with love.", "If it is an intrusive thought why are you giving it so much time? Intrusive thoughts LIE and misrepresent things. There is absolutely no need to rank people in that way.", "They absolutely are arbitrary. Stop thinking that just because you had a thought it means it\u2019s right. Anxiety means having all kinds of thoughts that are not objectively right in the slightest even if they do come easily and seem correct. To compare love for a romantic partner and love for a child requires over-simplifying the relationships to the point where the comparison is meaningless. If you *did* love your romantic partner and your child the same that would be an indication of serious issues. You have different responsibilities with a child versus a partner, you have different expectations, you will find joy in different things about the relationships, and you\u2019d better be making very different long term plans because partners don\u2019t usually grow up and move out and develop their own lives like kids should do. You certainly shouldn\u2019t be looking at your kid and having a rush of romantic love like you\u2019d get for a partner.\n\nEach relationship is it\u2019s own thing and that is *fine* and how it should be. Let them be independent individual things and don\u2019t try to compare them or justify the comparison.", "Isn't the point more that they would sacrifice each other for their children if they had to?  That's how I read it.", "I have two childhood friends who grew up in households like yours; loving parents who were so in love with eachother that even their children came second. Don't delude yourself, your son will know.", "And from the other side, my parents had a not-so-great marriage and I grew up hearing them argue and talk trash about each other. And I completely agree with everything you said. I wish I'd grown up with parents who loved each other the way OP and his wife do, but I do hope their kid never hears either of them say this.", "Very true but even amicable divorce and following co-parenting is hugely stressful to a child. Divorce access is incredibly important, but the ideal would be not needing one.", "Not at all. Your spouse should come first.", "I have been married 50 years.  My husband and I are a team.   It's a different kind of love.  I don't think there is a comparison.   \n\nnta", "I know it's a very human impulse to rank our people, but it doesn't help anyone--and doesn't really even make sense.\n\nIf you'd die for your son, what does it matter that your wife ranks higher?  We are no longer forced by MySpace to rank our friends.\n\nNTA and the whole thing is a nothingburger.", "NTA but have you ever considered shutting the fuck up? Why do you need to say everything you think out loud? To a person you have a strained relationship with?", "My parents love each other more than they love us (though we all know they love us epic amounts) and it is absolutely the best gift they could ever give us. Love your wife and show your kid what it means to be in a loving partnership that makes life happier all around. Don't feel guilty, love them both and enjoy the lucky spot you find yourself in!!"]}
