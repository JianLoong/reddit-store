A few days ago my sister and a kid who's 11M were playing around. My sister who's been annoyed by this kid because he always took my sister's backpack more than 10 times, she decided to get back at him for the first time by taking his backpack and running with it. The kid overexerted his power and ran at full speed to her to get his backpack and pushed my sister with his whole body strength. This made her be pushed and fall straight on the concrete floor with her face meeting the floor completely. As for the result, she has a swollen and scratched cheek as well, her glass lenses are all scratched up and the leg of the frame broke. We didn't know at the moment if her pinky broke but it was swollen. We took an xray and they told us it's broken.\n\nSo we went over to the kid's mom and told her about the situation and she blames my sister for taking his backpack. She said she'd pay half for the glasses only which infuriates me. I do kind of get her stance of how \"kids were just playing\" and such but it doesn't make sense how she can get hurt to this extent just cause a kid couldn't control his strength. I get that my sis took his backpack but he knows it was just a joke and he shouldn't have been that forceful and seen her like a target. And the bookback was unharmed, not even a single scratch but my sister is badly hurt. She can't hold a pencil straight either cause of this and she has really bad eyes so we get special kind of lenses for her. I think that i'm entitled to getting full payment for glasses/lenses. I'm not asking them for paying for the xray or broken bone, just the full payment of glasses but they told me they aren't going to do that since it is my sister's fault for taking his backpack.\n\nSo AITA reddit??", "created_utc": 1681835958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qvb2j/aita_for_asking_for_full_compensation_for_a_kid/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Im guessing not.  You don't mention their sizes -- 11 year olds can vary much in size.  some are still very childlike in size and others are much larger & taller.  For instance im 5'6\" tall.  Ive been that tall since i was 10, and at the time most of the other 10 yr olds only came up to my shoulder.", "INFO: Why are you managing this and not your parents?\n\nIn general, kids play and rough house, it seems your sister got the worst of it.  This is a legal question, not an AITA question.  If the boy was at fault, they would pay for the glasses and medical bills.  How are you paying for the broken finger?  I'm assuming insurance.  Google \"subrogation\" - see if your insurance company goes after the at-fault party.\n\nAlso, why are you/your parents allowing this kid to play with your sister?", "NTA\n\nThe boy took her backpack TEN times and she never resorted to violence. The day she does the same, she's thrown to the ground and gets up as the culprit?\n\nMom should get a lawyer and sue the parents and the school for not having stopped the bullying, as picking up someone's backpack TEN times is highly disruptive and made the girl feel insecure all the time. Now that she got her turn, she's the sole culprit? No, there must be a legal agreement there, involving the school, and no 50% of anything.", "NTA... you're not the a-hole for asking to be compensated but you shouldn't expect to get it. I mean, your sister \\*did\\* take his pack. They \\*were\\* playing around and kids that young often don't know how to not exert their full strength. I think this is as much your sister's fault as it is his and the people didn't even have to offer to pay for half the glasses, but they did.", "NTA.\n\nFacts, child pushes your sister down and caused both physical and property injury.  For everyone saying that taking the backpack started this and the girl is at fault, do you think a correct response to having your backpack taken is to assault the girl? If someone breaks into your house and takes an item worth less than $50 does that justify you finding the person, who doesn't right back, and slamming them to the ground and assaulting them?  Nope.  The medical insurance, depending on the costs for treatment will probably sue the other mother and win to subrogate the claim.  And for those of you saying you wouldn't pay a penny, if you child required medical care because of this situation, ask yourself if you would be ok being told to pound sand on the costs.  Mother of the boy and the boy both need to learn a lesson on responsibility.", "NTA. Sue for full payment and medical bills.", "Let's say the tables were turned. This other kid took your sister's backpack and she responded by pushing this boy. He falls to the floor and injures his back permanently. Would the mother accept it that her son deserves to be hurt and none of you are liable for his injury since he initiated it by stealing your sister's backpack and running with it. The answer to this question will tell you where you stand.", "NTA. \n\nThis one really hit home but for a strange reason! A long time ago, I stepped on a good friend's glasses & broke them. I was pretty broke at the time and she didn't ask me to replace them.\n\nI HAVE FELT GUILTY EVER SINCE. \n\nLike it's been more than a decade and this is one of those things where I look back and think, \"God why am I a shitty friend, why didn't I step up, it's not like \\*she\\* was rolling in dough...\" -- it's just so clear to me in retrospect that I ought to have paid for the mistake. I think our friendship suffered long term and I do not blame her.\n\nYeah it sucks when you break an expensive possession. It's so tempting to weasel out of doing the right thing. But you're not wrong to insist, OP.", "YTA.\n\nI hope your sister is OK. But I have to agree with the other kid's mom that your sister initiated physical contact this time. Without her initiation of backpack stealing, there wouldn't have been further contact. Kids don't know their own physical strength and you can't expect another 11-year-old to moderate how hard he would push back once challenged. \n\nAccept the offer to pay for half of the glasses, which is generous in the circumstance.\n\nAs for the other bullying from this kid, it's really shitty that she's been a target, but there are other, better forums to deal with that, then her further instigating the other kid. Talk to the school about the overall context and what kind of support they can provide.", "NTA. That's an assault, you could land the kid in juvie if you really wanted to and sue for medical expenses. Asking to replace the damaged glasses is very reasonable.", "YTA. She's offered to pay for half, your sister was a part of this game, why does she get none of the responsibility for what happened?", "YTA. Your sister is half at fault for trying to get back at the boy by taking his bag. His mother paying for half of the damage is reasonable.

Or at least, your sister is TA. \n\nShe was the one who started roughhousing with a lad who was very clearly bigger than her. She was the one who took his bag and ran away. Obviously he chased her, who wouldn't? \n\nIt's not a good thing that she got hurt or broke her glasses, but it was a situation she put herself in. \n\nI say take the 50% payment for the glasses, and make sure your sister learns the lesson from this.", "YTA- (lightly ta) your sister decided to get even and it backfired... she offered to pay half which is more than i would have done to a kid taking my Childs belongings. the issue should have been addressed the first time he took hers if she was that bothered by it, maybe she should have spoken to his mother about it because she seems more than reasonable and understanding.", "Soft YTA, I understand you asking but half the payment is pretty reasonable considering that your sister was the one that ran off with the other kid's bag. You, or your sister, are not \"entitled\" to the full payment at all.", "INFO: Why are you dealing with this and not your parents? Unfortunately your sister provoked the assault through theft. You can say the boy knew she was teasing but that doesn't change the fact that she took his property. You say he should have known his own strength. They are the same age so it could be argued that she should have known better than to provoke someone. Why are you holding the boy accountable and not your sister? The mom obviously believes the kids were jointly responsible for the fight and has agreed to pay for half of your sister's glasses. Unless you/your parents want to go down a legal route that may not help, take the money and move on.", "NTA but also I get why a parent would defend their kid. \n\nHave your dad beat up his dad, quick fix.", "ESH. All of you need to go to the timeout corner.", "INFO: Has your sister reported to an independent adult (teacher: class assistant: anyone?) that this boy kept grabbing her bag and running off with it?  \n\n\nTBC, I don't doubt her word that this 11-year-old boy was the one who, long-term, instigated the conflict by persistently bullying her, and then escalated the situation to violence when his target tried to retaliate the same way he'd been bullying her. It's just that without any external evidence, in this one incident, she instigated it by grabbing his bookbag, he retaliated by shoving her down - which shove, broke her glasses and her finger. Based on this one incident only, I think a fair-minded person would have to say YTA if you try to get the boy's mom to pay for more than half: she started it/he escalated it, half each.  \n\n\nBut, if she reported his persistent harassment of her to any independent authority, then the pattern looks different: he'd instigated the \"game\" of grabbing the other one's bag, and he escalated the \"prank\" to violent assault.   \n\n\nI'd be more concerned about what might happen next, and suggest you ask their school to figure out some kind of conflict resolution that strongly discourages this boy from grabbing bags/shoving people.", "YTA....your sister grabbed his bag. Period...now you should have dealt him grabbing her bag (10x) at grab bag number 2, or 3 or 4 or 5....", "YTA. (for this sub not in life) your sister did start it this time. Half is fair. She should convince him she has a haunted doll or something psychological to get back at him if he's bigger than her. \ud83e\udd2a", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus it's about my sister. The thing is we understand that this *can* be a legal issue but we don't wanna go take things far. We didn't really allow her to play with this kid either nor let her.

I also really don't think of this as theft. They are kids.. that boy also always gave her stuff back when he finished walking to his house. Same thing with my sister, she was going to give it back. It was a joke they both were doing, both of them knew this wasn't theft. And the only reason I hold the boy accountable is he overexerted his power. They both know each other as neighbors and my sister has never hurt him for him \"stealing\" her backpack. It's a shame that his strength hurt her but it *was* his strength.

There are so many ways this could've been accidental and only 1 where it's malicious. Not to mention the fact that an 11 year old boy stealing a girl's backpack regularly....seems somewhat likely he's got a crush he doesn't know how to handle. I don't think he was trying to hurt her, and even if he was, she did take his backpack in this scenario. She opened herself up to the repercussions, she (and therefore her family) owns part of the responsibility here.", "Okay, pictures the scene.\n\nI steal your bag and run away laughing.

We heard the situation from multiple parents of children and their children and got to know what happened fully.\n\n3.

While most kids would know not to shove another kid this hard, some children I've worked with absolutely do not understand this. They are rough and initiate a game by hitting or taking things that belong to other children, because then you get chased, and then it's like a game of tag.  Sometimes they do not know how to use their words to ask or are too afraid of rejection to ask. Sometimes they have adhd or are on the spectrum. It doesn't necessarily indicate bullying. That being said, this boys parents are not showing any concern for the wellbeing of other children, nor their son. He needs to be talked to about the cause and effect of his actions and possibly to be seen and diagnosed if this is an ongoing issue for him. They should absolutely pay for your sister's glasses (and for any and all medical care she has had/will need in my opinion) but if they've refused then I doubt you can force the issue. Even with a lawyer, your sister technically \"stole\" his belongings and purposefully engaged him. As wrong as it is, and as bad as I feel for your sister, it's going to be difficult to get justice under these circumstances. NTA I hope your sister recovers and can write again soon. \n\nOh, and have you tried ordering her glasses online? There are several good websites that offer glasses at a very affordable price. My eyes are extremely bad and I have a different prescription for each eye, so I usually end up paying a lot for glasses if I get them in a store or at the optometrist. Maybe check like Zenni or Firmoo. Even the Costco website sells frames cheap.", "I understand this kid took your sister's backpack previously, and she was annoyed by it. But when she did it, it was \"just a joke\". Is it only bullying when your sister is having stuff taken off her? \n\nIf it was a \"joke\", things went wrong.
