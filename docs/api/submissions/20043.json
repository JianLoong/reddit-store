A few weeks later E felt bad because she saw me waiting for the bus while driving S home and probably realized that it wasn\u2019t cool to act like that towards a good friend (and we were indeed good friends). The next week she offered to start driving me home again and I declined because I\u2019m not a charity case.

For instance, it is morally wrong to own a sweatshop in Bangladesh. It isn\u2019t illegal, and there is no obligation for you to close it, but it is morally wrong to subject others to the treatment that exists in a sweatshop.\n\nIn this case, OP is not obligated to do anything.

OP made no commitment beforehand to take his friend home, and cannot be compelled to do so through legal means.\n\nThis does not mean that morally, due to the nature of friendship, this is not a reasonable favor to ask. OP should be willing to help his friend in such a relatively small matter, and understanding the alternatives for his friend, it would was morally wrong to refuse help.\n\nAlthough there may be different definitions in the philosophical realm, where prominent philosophers see them as one in the same, the vernacular form recognize obligation to be based on laws and morality to be based on morals and ethics.", "I lose 20 minutes to this freaking subreddit more than I\u2019d like to admit", "so it is an obligation, right?\n\nI don't think its just semantics, because its interesting to say that someone is obligated to give a friend a lift home.
