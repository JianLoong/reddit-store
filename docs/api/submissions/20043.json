His friend was asking for a favour and he has all the rights to reject the favour. Ive had friends for over 10 years that have rejected simpler favours and vice versa just because we didnt want to do the thing. And yall aint even know his reasons for rejecting and just assume he is being petty. What if he just cant afford those 20 minutes in gas money? What if those 20 minutes will result in a schedule change for him? Just because you are very good friends doesnt mean you need to do every single favour the friend asks of you, big or small, you have the right to reject, thats why the friend is asking if OP will be able to give a ride. NTA.", "NTA You can say no and J can find another way home. Unsure what is the problem?", "NTA, if you go rock climbing multiple times a week he can sacrifice one night to have dinner with his partner and their family. 10pm is late, I wouldn\u2019t want to drive an extra 20 minutes to drop someone off who could have just skipped that night rather than inconvenience someone else, especially during the week when you have to wake up early for work. I would never expect my friends to drive me anywhere just because I asked\u2026I would ask but if they said no and I wanted to climb THAT badly, I would take an uber and not be offended at all\u2026because as an adult that is the consequence of my actions.", "NAH", "Only child alert!?!?! Yes, YTA.\n\nMy good friends wouldn\u2019t even ask beforehand and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give the ride. You probably have a pretty mixed up take on the concept of friendship.", "YTC**t", "I was \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by a friend for 2 hours round trip for a ride. She then helped me clean my apartment. Friends help friends.", "I'd hate to be his friend!", "I would go 20 min out of my way to help a total stranger get somewhere!", "Exactly. If he was asking regularly, yes you should put your foot down. But a one time favor is so minor, you should be willing to take 20 minutes to help a friend. God forbid you ever need a minor inconvenience favor.", "Right? I kept waiting for the \u2018and\u2019. It\u2019s 20 minutes! So he doesn\u2019t miss 40 minutes of rock climbing! Imagine having to explain to someone that friends sometimes do minor favours for each other? Are there actual aliens using AITA now to explore the human experience?", "OP sounds mad craic altogether./s  OP Unless there was a medical or childcare reason (and you haven't given one so I'll presume there wasn't) that you had to go straight home, YTA for not obliging your friend on this one occasion.", "Especially since J went out of his way to ensure he arrived on time to not waste anyones time", "This. I may be more wasteful of my time but I did a 20 min detour to drop a coworker after a hellish day where she stayed extra to help everyone/to avoid her being stuck with almost two hours of buses.", "In the edit they stated that friend asked beforehand and was declined", "It's 10 the guy had options and OP wanted to go home", "Id take a 20 min detour for an acquaintance.", "Nobody is worth 20 extra minutes every time you interact with them, or they become the friend you see rarely.", "This 100% , I have a friend who lives 1 hour and a half away from me. Granted I was already there that day but He got injured during a football match and in the evening he was barely able to walk I took him to the hospital and still had to drive an hour and a half back home. \n\nI would do it all over again because he is one of my best friends. I would even have driven over to help him out if I wasn\u2019t already there.", "I see your point but why didn\u2019t his friend just take his own damn car to the dinner? There should have been no situation to begin with!", "Post-refusal clarity?", "Yes! It takes a village. And someone who won\u2019t give you a lift home the one time you need it certainly isn\u2019t someone to count on.", "If he helped, he got no time to jack off later pssh", "Agree. Even more reason to not feel obligated as the friend could have just driven to the dinner and then to his outing without needing to inconvenience anyone else.", "Stop with the ridiculous only child stereotype. Plenty of only children are normal and functional people, and plenty of AH have siblings. This guy is just an AH, and it's not because of his family of origin's number of people.", "That\u2019s what the idiom is trying to convey; \u201cI\u2019d hate to be your enemy\u201d if this is how you treat your supposed friends.", "Woah, what an interesting point of view. I never would have considered that. That he might *enjoy* the favor he was doing, himself.", "In my friendship group, people will always give rides home. But we\u2019re also all women so we don\u2019t want each other using public transportation after dark. It\u2019s just expected that when you get a car, you return the favors.", "Yeah, but the guy had options because his other friends are BETTER FRIENDS than OP.", "I went to two restaurants with my family this weekend at locations with extremely limited parking that don't have the capacity for the 4 households to all drive separately. We had to meet up and carpool to go, we couldn't all drive separately.", "> So the friend gets all the convenience, but not the OP, the OP has to be inconvenienced? \n\nThere are three important people in this story. OP and two people that are good friends.\n\nPart of being in a friendship is supporting friends. In this instance, OP's acquaintance (yes i'm gatekeeping friendship.. OP doesn't have that), would have reaped all of the benefits of the relationship. OP didn't want to suffer a minor inconvenience.\n\nI don't know who OP is going to lean on in the future when they need support but their \"friends\" don't see any way to benefit from the exchange...", "Did you read the story? The friend getting their car would have meant a 40 minute delay. So no, not \u201cproblem solved\u201d, that was the problem he was TRYING to solve by asking for a ride.", "I wish I could downvotes this harder.", "There is a third option though. Friend could have taken a separate car to dinner so he could head straight to climbing after.", "They don\u2019t specify the logistics beforehand, but maybe he couldn\u2019t make dinner on time if he got his car and the dinner with the parents is prioritized over rock climbing.", "Oh, fair point - I totally glossed over the part where he didn\u2019t drive to dinner just to make it more convenient for him. In my head I was thinking he didn\u2019t have a car because his partner needed it to get home from their joint dinner with the family.", "That's what friends do for one another. If you don't understand that, I'm a little surprised you have any friends left.", "[removed]", " You might even consider doing things for acquaintances and thereby make more good friends.", "This is a bot who stole this comment.", "I gave 30 minutes of my time to a complete stranger to drive to my house, get a floor jack, and tire iron. It was only 10 mins of extra driving, but helped him out as other people declined. We are friends now.", "Okay, **weird** anger right there. Is that something that's on your mind a lot?", "don't make it sound like men don't have supportive friendships with other males, or that women always do - that's bs.\n\nnot always doing favours doesn't mean it isn't a strong friendship.", "More like a very short chat. Twenty minutes don't even register. I've lost twenty minutes to a series of browser tabs more than once.", "OP is a real \"nice guy\", yaknow not like the others \\s", "Bot", "Says the man.\n\nYou dont know what our relationships are actually like. Just because people fight doesn't mean they hate each other.", "It's still a 40 minute round trip for op to drive the person, lmao.  Not to mention the cost of fuel, op friend got a lift off someone else too. He said no end of story he is not an ass for that", "You have to be a really kind buddy OP. It turned out to be pettiness, but I had hoped that at least you would decline due to another appointment or whatever.", "Right? Me and my bestie watch TV together once a week and sometimes only get one episode in instead of our usual 2 because we spent the first hour chatting.", "Did I say ALL women, did I say MOST...heck, did I even say A LOT... \n\nNO I DID NOT.\n\nSo why the sexist bullshit \"says the man\"? Men are allowed to witness and share behavior, we do have eyes, we do have ears. It was an observation, a personal one and does not represent any majority or whole sampling of anything but my own personal experience. \n\n I said the behaviors I have witnessed.  \n\nNo human gender is the measurable standard on better friendships.", "Waaa. Call me entitled all you want, 40 minutes isn\u2019t shit when it comes to helping out a good friend. Sounds like this guy is the type of person who thinks they can just spend time with others and that\u2019s friendship. Which is sad :/", "So OP is all of a sudden representative of men in general? \n\nOP is TA here, I have never had issues doing favors for friends and expected nothing in return (nor any other men that I know), it's just part of being a human friend...we do stuff for each other. \nNo one gender has the market cornered in being better at friends. \n\nThat was my issue with the statement.", "I don't believe you saw me argue that OP -- or anyone I've mentioned, including me and my friend -- are representatives of any gender. Once again, all I'm trying to do is answer the question you posed of \"since when have female friendships been seen as more supportive than male\"\n\nIf that was a rhetorical question you never intended anyone to answer, forgive me for assuming otherwise"]}
