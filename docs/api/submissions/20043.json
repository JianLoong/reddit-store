He clearly has his own car as you state so it's not like this was a regular occurrence. If you can't do a friend a favor what's the point of having friends? Usually, you can count on your friends for more than a lift home. I hope you never need a favor from anyone cause you are definitely in the wrong. What a poor friend you are. If I was in your 'very good friends' shoes, I'd be questioning just how good of friends we really were. You left the guy stranded. At worst you could've asked for a couple of bucks for gas.

Not sure how you can define yourself as a good friend.", "YTA  \nYes he could and should have asked you beforehand, but come on a 20 minute detour is like 10 minutes more with your very good friend and 10 minutes solo drive. \nWhat did he end up doing?", "YTA, kinda. Is he really a good friend? I've dropped everything and driven three hours to pick up a friend after a five minute call cause she needed me. 20 minutes just doesn't seem like a problem for a friend that you wanna spend time with. I could understand if you had something more pressing to do or if you were low on gas but I'm assuming you or your friend had the money to cover that if you guys were paying to go rock climbing?", "U just sound petty bro", "YTA\n\nA 20 minute detour to help out a \"good friend\" really shouldn't be an issue. \n\nIf you think that's an issue to help out a good friend, then J should get a new friend.", "YTA\n\nYou're idea of \"very good friend\" is a bit off. You're a horrible friend. A 20 minute drive so that your \"very good friend\" doesn't miss out on 1/3 of the time you climb? And that was too much to ask of you?

If he was a mere acquaintance, or if he wanted it every time, it would be much more taxing for you and more understandable if you refused.\n\nHe was in a pretty normal situation, did not cause it by his stupidity (albeit a bit of lack of planning, but who doesn't do this from time to time), and it would have been only 20 minutes and some petrol for you.\n\nBy refusing to help him out just for the reason you stated, you clearly put him from the category \"a very good friend\"  into that of \"a random bloke I do not care much about\". And if YOU need something next time, he would be fully entitled to refuse on the basis you are inconveniencing him instead of yourself.", "YTA\n\nOf course you didn\u2019t have to, you had no obligation, but was it really that much of an ask to drop someone off home?

I thought at least you decline because of annother appoinment or something, turned out just pettiness.", "Jfc guys like you are doing nothing to help men build the supportive relationships that women have with one another.\nYes, I kindof think YTA.
