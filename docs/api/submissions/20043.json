At no point did she ask me for anything in return, she just wanted to talk to me, catch up on life, spend time with me\n\nOP (M) and his friend (M) don't have a dynamic where there's a value for OP to take 20 minutes to drop him off -- there's none of that wanting to spend that time together just to spend that time together. It's a \"your convenience vs. my convenience\" dynamic"]}
