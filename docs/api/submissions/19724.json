Does she help out with the child? \n\nI would imagine that she has put in her time sitting in coach and wrangling children when she was the mother of young kids. Now she can afford to be in luxury.

You talk about how you pay the majority share of the vacation expense as if her sitting first class has any barring on that split. But she pays for her own flight, not you, so her downgrading to coach does nothing but force her into unneeded discomfort to protect your ego from feeling lesser. It's a very \"if I have to suffer I'm going to make you suffer too\" mentality and that just feels kinda cruel.\n\nINFO: If she downgraded her ticket would that mean she would then pay more towards other vacation expenses?

Flew first class recently for a medical trip, after many years of all trips being coach.\n\nIf it's not completely ridiculous, I'm paying for that upgrade from here on out, or just not going. It makes that big of a difference.\n\nBeing comfortable matters. Having room to physically relax & a convenient bathroom really, really matters as you get older or have medical issues. If you pack intelligently, you're also pretty much guaranteed to keep your check-on with you. Not always the case with sold-out flights in coach.  The elderly & disabled often have more in their carry-ons they need with them for medical purposes.\n\nYou arrive at your destination with the peace of mind of having what you need with you. You have better energy from rest & hydration (if you stuck to water) & better ability to figure out what's next on your trip.\n\nWhy do you need your MIL to suffer and be uncomfortable in the airport and on the plane?

Or short haul F/J where she has a membership to a standard airline lounge with some guest benefits?\n\nWe've had variants of this situation over the years.  Sometimes we're traveling with 5.  I'm the one with the miles and upgrade instruments.  Due to seat availability, sometimes we'll grab 2 J and 3 Y or whatever.  For lounges, if I can guest in 2 people we'll trade off who goes to the lounge and who hits up the food court.  (Talking standard lounges here, not the long-haul F lounge.)\n\nI'm kind of leaning NAH here.  As the one with the access, I try not to isolate myself or leave anyone out entirely.  But I also don't want the benefits to go unused...\n\nPart of me wonders why MIL can't upgrade a second seat or guest people into lounges but this is obviously availability- and airline-dependent.  (Most airlines have a process for a +1 but not a +3.)\n\nNote: standard airline lounges like the United Club are okay but not worth stressing over.  International first class lounges, especially in big hubs like Singapore, Dubai, and Hong Kong, are fantastic and not to be missed if you have access.", "YTA. My grandparents do this.

If OP wants her to chip in, they can say so. But, her share would still only be 25%.", "Agreed.  She\u2019s a senior - if she wants to spend her money on it - let her. She\u2019s older - let her have the comfy seat. She\u2019s done her time, let her enjoy some comforts on her old bones.

She\u2019s also paying for her own ticket so she gets to do what she pleases it\u2019s her money not his also I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to sit with a young child on a long flight. Idk why this dude has such an issue with first class seating it\u2019s not his money and he\u2019s not paying for it so he really has no opinion but is just jealous that she travels in style.
