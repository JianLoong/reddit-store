Ok a couple of things.  The overwhelming opinion appears that this is based off of jealousy.  Believe it or not, it plays no part whatsoever.

Is it cool to go on a trip with someone, and it could be anyone really, and have them ditch you as soon as you get to the airport? \n\nThis has really blown up though!  Thanks for all the input.

Does she help out with the child? \n\nI would imagine that she has put in her time sitting in coach and wrangling children when she was the mother of young kids. Now she can afford to be in luxury.

Why should she have to suffer through coach travel off she can afford not to.  \n\nWhy does it bug you.  If you were on vacation without her you would be in the identical situation.", "YTA.  Comfort is reason enough.  She doesn't need to have a medical condition in order to want to fly in comfort.    \n\n\nThe costs of restaurants and taxis is a totally separate issue.

You wish you were able to splurge on first class and watching someone close to you get that luxury when you can't stirs up emotions and that's completely valid but its also something you have to deal with yourself.\n\nYour MIL flying first class really shouldn't make a difference to you. You talk about how you pay the majority share of the vacation expense as if her sitting first class has any barring on that split. But she pays for her own flight, not you, so her downgrading to coach does nothing but force her into unneeded discomfort to protect your ego from feeling lesser. It's a very \"if I have to suffer I'm going to make you suffer too\" mentality and that just feels kinda cruel.\n\nINFO: If she downgraded her ticket would that mean she would then pay more towards other vacation expenses? Does she act snotty about flying first class or talk down about y'all being in coach? Would it make a difference if she skipped the pre-flight amenities and the only difference was in flight seats?

Like she is some kind of better race? just because she can show-off money?

He puts up with me, my constant stream of consciousness conversations, my annoying cheerfulness and non stop energy. Believe me, that can get to be too much. He also has some serious health conditions that I recognize will most like shorten his life and reduce his ability to travel and live the way he wants to, so I want him to have the most and the best while he can. We won\u2019t have forever together, we may not have a happy ending, but we can have a beautiful now."]}
