You talk about how you pay the majority share of the vacation expense as if her sitting first class has any barring on that split. But she pays for her own flight, not you, so her downgrading to coach does nothing but force her into unneeded discomfort to protect your ego from feeling lesser. It's a very \"if I have to suffer I'm going to make you suffer too\" mentality and that just feels kinda cruel.\n\nINFO: If she downgraded her ticket would that mean she would then pay more towards other vacation expenses?

YTA", "the arrangement sounds fair as it is. you're NTA for not wanting to travel with her, but have you talked to your wife about it? i don't get why you are so bothered tbh", "I mean YTA.\n\nDo I think it\u2019s a little lame? Sure. Does it impact you literally at all? No. This is a silly hill to die on", "Jealous much? Green isn't a good color for you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nShe gets to fly in whatever class she wants. You are 75% of the traveling party. You\u2019re paying your share. She\u2019s not hurting anyone. This is bizarre.", "YTA. If she pays for her own ticket she can sit where she wants. Why should she pay for a cheaper seat just to sit next to you and make you feel better? Do you just want to sit next to her so bad? You say you don\u2019t even know why you care\u2026we don\u2019t either. Seems like you\u2019re just being petty. Take a breath and get over it.", "YTA one suggestion would be to fly on a different day than her if this bothers you, so darn much.", "Nta. Make her pay for all of her share. If she doesn't want to be with y'all, she can pay her restaurant bills, her rental car, and everything else on her own.", "yta - why do you care that she's not sitting with you on the plane or in the airport? she's paying for her own travel.", "YTA. Flying is a pita. She already raised one family, she can do whatever the f she wants. Suck it up, buttercup.", ">Not even that sure why it bother me so much\n\nIt's called jealousy.  YTA.", "YTA.  I don't know your MIL's age, but why shouldn't she have her own hotel room?  I wouldn't want to share a room with a married couple and their child unless I was absolutely broke, or the hotel was booked up. And as I get older, travel gets more challenging.  Going through security with a priority pass makes the trip much easier.  If she is paying for her hotel room and air fare, I don't know why it's a problem for you.", "YTA Stop pretending this so anything more than you being jealous you don\u2019t get to sit in first class. So you are taking your toy and going home like a spoiled child. She is paying for her own flight and hotel and some of the restaurants. You are doing her no favors here. I\u2019m sure if anything, she\u2019s going to watch your kid so you can get alone time. Really and truly get over yourself.", "Yta lol who cares what she does", "YTA\n \nI don't.even understand why this matters", "YTA. She is paying for it, she's an adult, she can sit where she wants. She isn't to blame when you are too poor to pay for first class.", "YTA. Her choice here has zero effect on you.", "> Not even that sure why it bothers me so much\n\nI think you know but don't want to admit it", "YTA for not wanting to travel with your mother-in-law because she flies first class while you\u2019re in coach.  You stated she pays for her own flights so she can choose how she flies.  YWNBTA if you felt like she didn\u2019t contribute more towards the parking, rental car, and transportation and chose not to travel with her because of that AFTER you asked her to help contribute more to a trip and she declined.", "Just go to the airport separately. Then you won't be separated. Go on different flights. \n\nInfo Does she help pay for the gas/taxis to get the airport?", "YTA.", "YTA. You sound like a hater lmao", "For sure YTA. Let this woman live her life in style the way she wants to and mind your business", "YTA and I hope you don\u2019t deprive your children of future vacation experiences and opportunities to make loving memories with their grandma due to petty jealousy.", "INFO:  Why do you keep dodging the question of how old your child is?  Is \"well-behaved\" just your opinion or have others (including MIL) also expressed that opinion?\n\nWould you be OK if MIL upgraded your wife to sit with her and left you in Economy with your child?\n\nWhen MIL pays for restaurant bills, are the restaurants generally nicer than the ones you pay for?  Is the child old enough to have a separate meal?  Do you understand what people are saying about the restaurant bill splitting actually being pretty fair and that you would be paying for parking & Ubers even if MIL wasn't there.  And then you would be paying 100% of food costs.\n\nYTA.  I hope your MIL starts jetting off in First Class on her own trips.  Or just invites your wife.", "YTA - let it go\u2026\u2026. This is a would you rather situation and maybe it is best she hangs out at the lounge apart. What is the real issue here?", "You're opener makes YTA its clear that you resent her and are jealous by using the words \"she's too good to\"\n\n\nAfter that the rest is just you trying to rationalize it.", "YTA. Why does it matter where you sit on the plane? The point is being together when on the trip. The plane just gets you from point A to B. If I could afford first class I would never sit in coach again either", "YTA -  you are being petty.", "NAH \n\nYou can choose who to go with, and who you\u2019re comfortable traveling with. \n\nSounds like she is using her money for luxury while letting you pick up most of the vacation bills which is kinda rude", "NTA.\n\nMIL sounds awful. Is she part of the team or not? Clearly she feels entitled to your resources for a vacation, but not to help out with the kid. She is abusing her welcome as a MIL and if she had any sense in her head or if she gave a solitary fuck about you as a member of the family she would understand that she is interfering with a nuclear family vacation. Grandparents are so important. 2 of mine lived in the same town as me growing up. They did not come on fucking vacation with us.", "NTA.  I think if you really like her, it won't matter.  It will matter if there are other things about her that you don't like, which is ok.  May ne you and your wife need to talk about your family travelling alone insteaf of taking your MIL every time.", "Just stop paying for everything? Then maybe she won\u2019t be able to afford first class. You\u2019re getting annoyed for reasons that you\u2019ve created. So stop. YTA.", "Nta.  What kind is family vacation is that?  I would never travel with my mil if she refused to sit with us in the plane or airport.  What an elitist. And then she doesn\u2019t offer to pay for meal after she got a first class ticket?  What is happening?!?  \n\nNo I think you are correct.  Most people wouldn\u2019t like that.  Most wouldn\u2019t do it twice.  It\u2019s rude behavior. Most people don\u2019t like rudeness.", "My husband flies a lot for work. Sometimes when we travel he gets upgraded to First Class. He will always ask me and I always tell him to take it. I\u2019m an easy breezy traveler, I make friends a long the way and try to let all inconveniences roll off my like water off a ducks back. He is a very grumpy traveler, wants everything to work like clockwork and has minimal patience. So I prefer he get a cushy seat and some nice distance from us plebeians. \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t care where we sit. We are going to the same place and we live together. We can fly separate. Plus he often chooses to upgrade both of us to Comfort Plus, and I appreciate his willingness to forgo a perk he has earned.", "MIL is probably forced to be the babysitter - no wonder she wants some time to herself beforehand", "Exactly, and they do sell lounge passes, they're like 50$ or so. Not really a bit deal unless you're on a long layover for a long haul. Otherwise who cares.", "Why would she? She pays her way and some more", "75% of the food isn\u2019t really accurate, kids meals are like half the cost of adult meals at worst, it\u2019s probably closer to 65%. If the moneys an issue I don\u2019t get why they don\u2019t just get separate bills.\n\nI do find it odd the MIL would prefer to travel alone in first class rather than sit with her family, but then again I\u2019ve never been in first class so maybe it\u2019s worth being alone. Either way it doesn\u2019t make her an ass", "You sound as angry and entitled as OP.", "In what universe is standing next to someone in an airport security queue quality time with family?\n\nIt doesn't sound like she splits off from the family at any other time during the holiday except the maybe 2 hours at the airport. I really don't understand what the problem is.", "No where does OP say she is drinking in the lounge. You  made that up entirely. \n\nPeople use airport lounges to relax and get away from the bustle and noise too.", "It's the airport, not the destination, and unless you show up hella early, you probably won't find 4 spots right next to each other anyways. With OP having a wife and kid, MIL is in a different row anyway for the trip so why make her sit with two strangers when she can have her own seat up front? Most of the time people zone out on a flight anyways. I guarantee that this is just OP being jealous about MIL riding up front and getting lounge access.", "I've traveled with friends and don't always sit next to them.  I sleep for 90% of the flight. And when I'm not sleeping I'm watching a movie.  We aren't playing dominos back there.  He is just a hater.", "Or have medical condition such as diabetes where it's very easy to get injured sitting in such cramped seats for more than hour, on top of worrying about circulation problems in the legs due being in the air. So premium/business class & up along compression socks are a must for me when flying because I don't want to be limping getting off plane and through the airport to baggage claims and/or the exit...", "Does she ditch you guys while on vacation too, or just at the airport? That makes a huge difference here. I can understand maybe being annoyed with the airport behavior but outright not letting her travel with you because of it is dumb. Plus she can always just book her flight to the same destination as you anyway", "Why is it more polite to just un-invite her from vacations than be a big boy and talk to her?", "u/simplelogical6827\n\nMan, you must be a drag of a human to be around. Literally the MIL is doing what 99.99% of the world would do, try to get away from you. Also, everyone knows why it bothers you, you can't afford it and are jealous as fuck", "She doesn't need to sit with you if she doesn't want to. Shit, if I could afford to sit in first class I would too. Why would someone sit in a more uncomfortable area if they didn't have to? This smacks of you just being jealous that YOU aren't sitting in first class and she is.", "I'd definitely sit by myself in first class if I were her too...its wayyyy better. Lol.", "I love my family, but if someone offered me warm towels, champagne and a few hours of silence before I spend a good stretch of time with them imma take it", "Never travelled first class but have done business class a few times.  Short hall business class in Europe is usually a bit meh but got flight got swapped from an a320 to a 777 once and wow what a difference.  100% would jump at the chance to do that again after flying coach.", "OP is still a hater.", "OP's burner account.", "Redditors will just say any dumb bullshit if they think it's a \"dunk\"", "What a gross overstatement here. Me and my 8 year old took a flight a few months ago. She spent the first half watching a movie on her tablet and the rest reading her book. How is that misbehaving? \n\nThe most annoying person on the flight was the middle aged man that talked loud enough for the entire plane to hear him for the majority of the flight. But yes, blame the kids.", "I would imagine that she has put in her time sitting in coach and wrangling children when she was the mother of young kids. Now she can afford to be in luxury. Is she divorced? Widowed? Why do you care that she enjoys herself on her own dime? You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity to fly comfortably in the future.", "She seems to have her sht in order, stop resenting her for it. Or do you prefer an old lady next to in the cattle cart complaining for 8 hours straight?", "I agree - it\u2019s probably her treat before being run ragged by children all holiday. Then a nice chill out again on the way home.", "So I guess no headphones on the plane if you're travelling with regards like you", "I think his MIL might be of the same cloth as my own mother. My mom hates kids but she had 3", "I\u2019ve commended people on how well behaved their children have been on a flight - didn\u2019t even know they were there. For reference, I travel from NYC to Orlando about four times a year so you can imagine how many children are on those flights. \ud83d\ude05", "Your children have never cried on a flight? \n\nEspecially when they were young?", "You would think OP would be happy to have the space on the flight. Unless OP wants to be sitting in first and the women take care of the child in coach.", "No, they're looking for an argument.", "This is the real issue. Jealousy. If he stops traveling with the MIL does it change his airport experience? No he's still stuck in coach with his family.", "Every flight has more kids on it than you realize. It only takes one screaming kid to make you hate flying with children, though.", "Mine hasn\u2019t", "No, clearly you care more about not being able to drink in the lounge yourself. Painfully obvious. Family is just a bush to hide behind.", ">We have to work with the facts we have not make assumptions based on anecdotal experiences.\n\nSays the person who completely fabricated the idea that this woman is going to the lounge to drink. You have zero idea what she's doing in the lounge, but you just decided she must be drinking in there.", "Mine either, but we are in a VERY SMALL minority here", "It sounds like you actually care more about that but you\u2019re trying to turn it around on the other person. It\u2019s weird to separate at any time of the trip unless it was previously talked about?\n\nIf my MIL pays as much as OP did, and while they\u2019re unpacking i go off for hours by myself not talking and drinking by myself while they\u2019re unpacking.. That\u2019s weird.", "it looks like you're projecting right now", "I don\u2019t know that we are. I used to fly a lot, both long and short haul flights and I honestly can\u2019t remember an issue that wasn\u2019t *maybe* a couple of minutes at most. The way people talk about babies and children on flights is like it\u2019s a 100% guarantee they\u2019ll scream the whole time.", "Yeah mine never has either. She'll get maybe a little bored/fussy, but isn't loud about it.", ">it's obvious the MIL doesn't want to\n\nI don't see how you draw this conclusion at all. She wants to go to/from the airport together, ride the same flight. I'm sure she'd love for them all to also ride with her in first and use the lounge but they choose not to.\n\nOf course she can afford a cab on her own but.... Why? You are going from and to the same place? Especially at the destination - you are going to the same hotel. Why would you travel separately? Makes no sense. \n\nThere's nothing about what she is doing that is rude. Why do you expect her to suffer through an economy class experience when she can afford first?", "Man you stupit af", "Maybe OP should just ask for 25% of the Uber fare, then she pays her own way and you can untwist your panties.", "Are you the OP? You're passionately defending him despite it not being a big deal.\n\nSpending time with family and apart on trips is completely fine. What exactly would MiL be doing at the airport? Babysitting? Because that's the only reason to take this so personally. Was OP hoping MiL would provide free childcare at the airport and on the plane?\n\nShe's more than contributing. If she wants to avoid airport chaos and, with her own money, pay for a better experience at the beginning and end of the vacation only, more power to her. She's not obliged to be free childcare, nor is she obliged to be less comfortable on vacation.\n\nOP is pretty entitled to assume she should downgrade just to be with them. He sounds exhausting.\n\nYTA vote obviously.", "Its weird to insist that everyone must always be together for the entirety of the trip.\n\nSounds obnoxious and stifling to me.", "Actually, now that I think about it, you\u2019re totally right.", "[removed]", "I didn\u2019t say insist everyone has to be together, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s weird to just dip when people are busy and doing something without saying anything ?"]}
