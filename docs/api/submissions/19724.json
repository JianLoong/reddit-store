The 80/20 split isn't the same.\n\nWhat is your income compared to hers? And why do you alone seem to be making the decision instead of you and your wife -- it's her mom? Does she babysit sometimes on vacation for you?\n\nWithout knowing more, your feelings seem a little dramatic. Is something else going on?", "YTA\n\nShe doesn't need to sit with you if she doesn't want to. Shit, if I could afford to sit in first class I would too. Why would someone sit in a more uncomfortable area if they didn't have to? This smacks of you just being jealous that YOU aren't sitting in first class and she is. \n\nSave up more money, share the expenses more, and get yourself a first class seat!", "YTA. Envy is a bad thing. As long as she is paying her own way, why do you care how she travels.", "Info: when on the vacation, does she stay with the kid at some point while you and spouse go out? Does she help out with the child? \n\nI would imagine that she has put in her time sitting in coach and wrangling children when she was the mother of young kids. Now she can afford to be in luxury. Is she divorced? Widowed? Why do you care that she enjoys herself on her own dime? You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity to fly comfortably in the future.", "YTA\n\nIf you have issues with the split of meals and parking deal with those issues.\n\nThe first class thing is fine.  Why should she have to suffer through coach travel off she can afford not to.  \n\nWhy does it bug you.  If you were on vacation without her you would be in the identical situation.", "YTA.  Comfort is reason enough.  She doesn't need to have a medical condition in order to want to fly in comfort.    \n\n\nThe costs of restaurants and taxis is a totally separate issue.  If you want her to kick in more of her fair share, then man up and ASK.  Good grief.  \n\n\nLastly, if you want to spend time with her in the airport (why though?), then simply ask.  \"Hey MIL, we're gonna go to \\[airport restaurant\\] for dinner.

Because she wants it. It\u2019s weird that you want to control where she sleeps and where she sits.", "YTA, you\u2019re not an asshole though perse, but you\u2019ve done a lot wrong. It\u2019s her money, she can fly first class if she wants.\n\nYou haven\u2019t asked her to pay her fair share at the restaurants unless the 20% is her own share which if it is tbh, you can even complain about that.\n\nYou don\u2019t like it, pony up and fly first class, but tbh, well behaved or not, I also would prefer to not fly with a child if I could help it, not to mention an airplane row sits 3 not 4, why does it matter if she is sitting with you or not?", "YTA.  If she's racked up the points or has the $ to fly more comfortably at her age, why do you care or take offense.  Geez, grow up.  You can sit separately from your mom on vacation, I think you'll see plenty of her.", "YTA. She\u2019s paying for her own ticket and can get whatever ticket she wants.", "YTA.

Let her splurge her money however she wants! No need to make a fuss about other people's choices. We're all unique individuals with our own preferences and decisions. Nobody should be shamed for how they choose to live their life. Whether someone takes a pragmatic approach or goes a bit mad with their choices, they deserve the chance to learn from their own experiences. Instead of feeling envious, it's better to focus on our own journey and allow others the freedom to live theirs.", "YTA. There are plenty of reasons why your MIL might travel separately. Why would you assume it\u2019s because she is \u201ctoo good to sit with the rest\u201d of you? Bottom line- she\u2019s entitled to travel however she wants, and you\u2019re entitled to feel however you want to about it.\n\nEdit: As for this being \u201cyour last trip\u201d with her because of this, how will your wife feel about this? I\u2019d guess it\u2019s important to her to include her mom, and you don\u2019t say that your wife has a huge issue with how her mom travels. It seems incredibly selfish for you to make such a huge issue out of a day of travel to the point that you childishly refuse to go on the entire trip.", "YTA. You sound bitter and jealous.", "Ah yes, the old saying \"misery loves company\" strikes again. Why do you care what class she flies in? Especially when you spend the rest of the vacation together? I know when I fly, I pop in ear buds and zone out or read a book - my husband and I could give two craps whether or not we sit next to each other. And health reasons or not, there's nothing wrong with her having a little extra space and comfort if she can swing it. Jealousy is not a good look on you. YTA.", "info: have you asked her to contribute more financially?", "*flies", "So, do you want her to sit in coach or upgrade all of your family's tickets? She seems like she's pulling her own financial weight. She even pays for 20% of the restaurants for all 3 of you. It's difficult to see why you think that she thinks that she is too good? Do you just dislike her?", "YTA. She can travel any way she\u2019d like if she is paying. If you are unhappy over paying for other travel expenses, then you are free to stop doing so.", "YTA... get over yourself", "Leaning towards Y T A here, or at least you would be if you let this one thing effect future trips and continue to effect your opinion of her. This is clearly coming from a place of jealousy, whether conscious or not. You wish you were able to splurge on first class and watching someone close to you get that luxury when you can't stirs up emotions and that's completely valid but its also something you have to deal with yourself.\n\nYour MIL flying first class really shouldn't make a difference to you. You talk about how you pay the majority share of the vacation expense as if her sitting first class has any barring on that split. But she pays for her own flight, not you, so her downgrading to coach does nothing but force her into unneeded discomfort to protect your ego from feeling lesser. It's a very \"if I have to suffer I'm going to make you suffer too\" mentality and that just feels kinda cruel.\n\nINFO: If she downgraded her ticket would that mean she would then pay more towards other vacation expenses? Does she act snotty about flying first class or talk down about y'all being in coach? Would it make a difference if she skipped the pre-flight amenities and the only difference was in flight seats? If this was your own mom and not your MIL would you feel the same or would you appreciate her ability to splurge on luxuries like this?", "This is about the goofiest thing I've read in a minute. YTA.", "YTA. Some people like to have a little breathing room when traveling. She's not costing you anything extra. Most people would love that their MIL had her own space and gave them some privacy while on vacation.", "Why do you begrudge your mother this small luxury? She's not going to be around forever.", "you're.. kind of the AH, only for the mere fact you, yourself, don't understand why it's bothersome. not knowing why you're feeling that way can be frustrating and yes, very irritating. otherwise, you're the AH for not realizing that she used her OWN money for said luxury. she earned it, she can do what she wants.\n\ndevils advocate here, why aren't the costs split evenly? she's obviously capable of funding her end of things. it'd be different if there was some.. tit for tat. like, you're responsible for expenses a and b, while she'd be responsible for c and d.", "Yta and it seems like you are a hater.", "She has every right to travel in a way that meets her comfort, but that is pretty rude. Could pay for all to have more comfy seats. And you have the right to travel as you please. At the very least, I wouldn't pay for all the other stuff 100%...I get the food, if you have several kids...may vote later cause I'm stuck but you aren't an ah at all.", "So she pays for everything for herself?

I have status with United and get CPUs pretty regularly, so I wouldn\u2019t turn one down if it happened (plus I\u2019d bring someone with me) but I wouldn\u2019t intentionally do this beforehand. \n\nEspecially so for family. To be honest, if I got upgraded on a flight, I\u2019d probably give it to my parents on siblings. \n\nAnyways OP, I\u2019m not sure why people on here are acting like this is normal behavior. If you made a post saying you bought first class for yourself and made your wife and kid sit economy, I\u2019m not sure anyone would think you\u2019re in the right there.
