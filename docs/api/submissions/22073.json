A few months ago I moved back home with my parents while I finished school so my boyfriend and I are currently long distance for context. \nI usually do not like the bar scene but it was my friend\u2019s birthday celebration and she wanted to grab some drinks. I had one drink along with a shot of tequila the bartender offered me for free. After taking the shot I hardly remember anything apart from laying on the bathroom floor puking unable to get up. When I was finally able to get up my friends took me home and took care of me. It became pretty clear one of my drinks had been drugged. It was terrifying. \nThe following day my boyfriend was extremely short and upset with me. I do not remember but apparently I had texted my boyfriend about how two men were hitting on me, telling him that they were very charming but that I rejected them because I was loyal and loved him. We\u2019ve mutually agreed in the past that neither of us want to hear about the other being hit on, as long as we\u2019re faithful there\u2019s no point in knowing/creating unnecessary insecurity. I apologized for my behavior and told him I genuinely would have never told him in my right mind. He told me he doesn\u2019t think me \u201cbeing drugged is a valid excuse for rubbing these men in his face\u201d. He also questioned whether or not I was actually roofied. I became so mad at him for questioning an experience that was genuinely traumatizing for me. \nI understand I disrespected him and made him uncomfortable but I was still loyal at the end of the day and it doesn\u2019t seem like that should be the priority after literally being roofied?

My boyfriend and I have a boundary in our relationship where we do not like to hear about passes being made on one another. In my text messages I described the men as \u201ccharming\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d telling him that one of them was a stand up comedian and I might go to his show.

He is uncomfortable because he's being an insecure dick that can't even give you compassion for another person DRUGGING you because you mentioned men hitting on you.    \n\n\nHe cares more about you as a possession than your well being.", "NTA. You got drugged and had a traumatizing experience. Your boyfriend believes he is the injured party here because you texted him while you were drugged. Why are you with him again?", "NTA\n\nThis is a huge red flag. How do you think he would respond if you were actually sexually assaulted? He would blame you, he is an AH.", "NTA  \n\n\ndump him NOW he completely dismissed you being roofied because it inconvenienced him", "The entire point of drugs like that is to mess with your brain to the point that you don\u2019t know which way is up. If he honestly thinks you should have remembered your deal while your brain was temporarily mashed potatoes then he needs to speak to an expert who, after looking at him in complete disgust, will educate him on how the brain actually works. \n\nWould he expect you to run on a broken leg using the power of love? NTA but your boyfriend is an idiot. If he can\u2019t realise this and apologise then I wouldn\u2019t trust him to care for you in an emergency.", "So, you get drugged and almost kidnapped? by randoms and your bf is upset that you texted him about guys hitting on you?????  NTA but you really need to rethink that relationship.", "NTA sounds like he doesn\u2019t care about your well-being more than his ego.", "Your bf is the AH and a huge one at that. You were drugged, how did that disrespect him? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "NTA-  I\u2019m sorry you were drugged and now shamed by someone who is supposed to care about your well-being. I feel like your partner may be a bit immature and not fully understand what happened to you. As others have hinted/ said , I\u2019d rethink the relationship or at least revisit the topic and hope that your partner can understand how serious being drugged is .", "Nta. And bf is waving a huge redflag that when something bad happens to you he only cares about how he perceives it to affect him. You were drugged by someone with not good intentions.  You  could have had a fatal reaction to the drugs, could have been raped beaten killed etc...but to him the important issue isnt the danger you were in...because his \"feelings\" got hurt.", "NTA", "In my opinion: NTA \n\nIf my significant other reacted that way to me being drugged. They\u2019d no longer be my significant other.", "> I understand I disrespected him\n\nNo you didn't. And his priorities are way off. If he's willing to believe you weren't roofied when nothing happened.... would he still believe you if something *had* happened? \n\nI don't want to further traumatize you, but the list of things that could have gone wrong is terrifying. But he's concerned you *didn't cheat*. Is this really the kind of guy you want to be with?", "NTA\n\nFirst, are you positive those texts happened? It'd be odd for you to delete them in such a state after sending but even if you did, if you have iMessage logged into multiple devices they should actually still be on the other ones. Just feels odd that you don't have the texts still. But even if those texts 100% happened, he's showing absolutely zero sympathy to you going through a traumatizing ordeal. Even if you two have serious boundaries on never mentioning when other people hit on you, there needs to be context and understanding and he's showing none here. This type of reaction is a evaluate-the-entire-relationship level response imo.", "> I understand I disrespected him\n\nJust stop.\n\nYou were drugged against your will. How in heaven's name is that disrespectful?\n\n>but I was still loyal at the end of the day\n\nAgain, just stop.\n\nIf you're drugged against your will at a bar, what happens next is *not* a test of loyalty. \n\nNTA.", "NTA who the hell knows if you were even the one who texted him from your phone?

Surely the texts are still on your phone?", "NTA and please run\u2026. this man is mad at you for the fact that other men threatened your safety without your consent. The appropriate response was to be worried about you and your health. If he doesn\u2019t care about that, he likely will blame other instances where your safety was threatened on you.", "NTA, and your bf is way out of line for this. He doesn\u2019t sound like he has even a little bit of concern for what happened, which was of course traumatic for you.", "NTA. BREAK UP WITH HIM", "Absolutely NTAH. It was not your fault!!! My husband was so loving and supportive after I was roofied. I was afraid that I agreed to something l wouldn\u2019t normally have agreed to. He insisted that none of it was my fault. Your boyfriend was callous and disrespected you, not the other way around. One of the worst things someone can do is blame you for an assault. Please leave him. You deserve better. \nAlso, if you choose to report this to the police, make sure someone you trust is with you. Police can add to the trauma even if they have good intentions.", "Ah yes because she was supposed to consult her crystal ball and predict the outcome of her evening. Jesus you people are exhausting.", "NTA. You can\u2019t overcome roofies with sheer willpower - they are powerful sedatives! Your boyfriend is not only ignorant, he is also using his ignorance to avoid supporting you after a traumatic experience. \n\nI was drugged at a bar and called my -ex- from the bar bathroom to come and get me. I\u2019m not sure why I decided he was the one to call, but I did. He showed up, took me home, and called one of my friends to keep an eye on me.

How would he have reacted if you had been r*ped by one of them????", "The lack of understanding and common sense on your bf's part is gross, most people understand that you have no control over yourself when you're drugged. That's why people drug others, so that they can take advantage of that loss of control and memory in most cases. He is way out of line being angry about this, let alone denying that it really happened. I wonder if he is really that insecure that he believes you were trying to hurt him? But in reality he should be extremely grateful that these men only hit on you and nothing else. It's sickening! NTA, but your bf is.", "NTA You are absolutely NOT the asshole. What a scary experience for you!!  How dare he make those comments. You were DRUGGED.  I\u2019m not usually one to jump on the dump him bandwagon, but I\u2019ll make an exception for him.  When my now husband and I were dating and long distance, I had a similar situation. He tried to hop on a plane to make sure i was ok.

You are part of the problem!", "You should not have\u2026 gone to a public place in celebration of your friend\u2019s birthday? Tf?", "Why? Bars are for anyone as long as you're over 18 (or whatever age it is in the US). Sad that people can't go out and expect to have a nice night, she was with friends so it's not unreasonable to assume she'd be safe. It's unfortunate that it wasn't the case in the end but if we all stopped doing stuff that might be unsafe in the wrong circumstances, we'd probably all be holed up inside 24/7 because most things come with some sort of risk."]}
