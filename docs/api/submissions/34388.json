I chose to ask my (paternal) granny. I chose not to ask mom because she and I had a less close relationship than she and my brother did growing up. My granny is the person who gave me the support I needed. My mom's husband told me it had really hurt to be publicly declared not a parent or parent figure when he has always thought of us as his kids in some way.\n\nI asked him if a special dance with mom or walking down the aisle with mom would make him feel better and he said no.

I asked him if there was something else he would like to do and he said he wanted to walk me down the aisle or perform a father/daughter dance. I told him neither of those were an option. But if he wanted to do something else we could discuss it.\n\nHe and mom both mentioned it over the last few months and now my wedding is closing in on us and my mom told me I should have given him an actual role as a parent of the bride.

And you were already grown enough to not need parental support from him as you were heading off to college. \n\nI feel like maybe he had grown to have some great expectations when it comes to the position he has in your lives. Which is not your fault. Maybe your mother could have insinuated how important he is to you kids hoping that you would see her husband as a father figure one day.

But I also don\u2019t see their stance changing very much and it\u2019s just going to put pressure on you even more, so I think you should do what you want do.

My mom got remarried when I was 23 after my dad passed at 19. My mom's husband is still my mom's husband, and it\u2019s been 7 years since then. He has not, nor will ever, be a father figure in my life. He knows his place and that we are cordial to each other but it's nothing like a father/daughter relationship. Please put your foot down because this is just the beginning. I'm in a situation where now i have to decide what my kids are going to call him. I'm opting for having my kids call him by his first name because he won't be a grandparent in my eyes. My opinion might change over time or we might find something else to call him, but at this moment I'm not budging. This is just the start of your battles and I hope you stick to what your gut is telling you because it is YOUR day. You want the memories and pictures of a happy day not one that was forced by your mother. You\u2019ve got this!", "Info needed\n\nThese posts really bug me. It is such a personal thing to go thru, but I guess I have questions. Did this man do anything at all for you? I mean aside from taking care of your mother emotionally. Did he pay off the mortgage? Did he help with your college? Did you mom help with any of your expenses and was she able to do those things because he was there. \n\nIt looks like you had little to no interaction as a parent, but I think if he did any of those things, perhaps he is not an awful person?", "NTA. If he keeps pressing, tell him his \u201cspecial dad job\u201d is to watch the cars in the Parking Lot so no one breaks into them. \n\nYou have already offered him ways to be included in the wedding and he has turned his nose up at them. A real dad would just be there for you in whatever capacity you want. \n\nSource look at my username. My daughter is only 8, but when she is old enough to get married my only concern or question wil be \u201cwhat would you like me to do to help out?\u201d\n\nNote there is no demand to be included, or statement of what \u201cmy rights\u201d should be.", "NTA. If he wanted to be a father figure, the time to start establishing that was when you were 16. For whatever reason that didn\u2019t happen, he doesn\u2019t get to be a father figure passively.

This is not.about.him!!", "NTA you have bent over backwards to compromise and thr only response you have gotten \"well can we buy the dad treatment?\" That's horrible and truly shows that neither of them deserve to be in your wedding. They can rent that kind of thing in Vegas (probably) if they want it. But your wedding is a real celebration of you and your partner.", "NTA. I'm sorry that your Mom and the supposed \"other parent\" are trying to manipulate you on your special day.\n\nYou deserve the wedding of your dreams.", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately, some Step parents believe that they get all the benefits of being a child's parent without putting in any of the work or stress EVER.  That they can literally just cruise in and that's that.\n\nIt's, to state it mildly, disgusting.\n\nCongrats on your bliss OP, and many happy years for you and those important to you!!", "No not at all! I regret having my stepdad in my wedding he\u2019s not even my stepdad anymore and I never cared for the guy. Do what YOU want it\u2019s YOUR day NTA", "NTA. You have valid reasons. If they refuse to listen to you, feel free to uninvite one or both from your wedding. You do not need to be harassed at this time. Planning a wedding is stressful enough. Time for them to accept it and shut up.", "NTA. But, I'm going to get the crap downvoted for this, this is why men should avoid marrying single women with children. As someone who grew up with a single mother who brought a step father in for me that I adored only for her to cheat on him 12 years later once I was in my early teens and throw him out like last weeks trash with zero legal recourse for custody. It's an absolutely thankless job whether it goes right or wrong (like it did here). This man's main offense seems to be being the husband of the mother she is not close to, so he never even had a chance to begin with and he didn't realize it.\n\nDon't do it guys.", "NTA. Even if he was your bio dad that wouldn\u2019t mean you\u2019d have to give him a role. I eloped, but if I\u2019d gone the wedding route, I wouldn\u2019t have asked my dad to walk me down the aisle- and not just because I think it\u2019s a stupid tradition. It\u2019s about the part people play in your life, not their technical title.", "NTA, I'm sorry but that's all he is, something to your mum. He is your mother's husband, and that's it. Did he put you through college, buy you a car, pay your rent? What did he do other than marry your mum? Don't let him lay a guilt trip on you.

Your mother doesn't realise what else she is going to lose going down this path.\n\nFocus on the friends and family who are actually supportive of you. \n\nMy mother I think was upset that my stepfather didn't walk me down the aisle or have much of a role in my wedding... ummm, my dad walked me down the aisle.  She didn't say anything but there were other comments.  I didn't let it worry me... we don't have a great relationship and never have.. even as a kid.", "NTA.

I would be creeped out by this dude.", "NTA and you were more than gracious to offer him other opportunities to be special on what is your special day. You were not rude or unkind as far as I can tell. It\u2019s understandable he\u2019s hurt and upset, but also understandable that you don\u2019t want him to fulfill father of the bride roles because he\u2019s not your dad. \n\nWhat\u2019s not understandable is him and your mom continuing to guilt trip you and attempting to \u201cbuy\u201d that privilege. When you sign up to be a stepparent it\u2019s kind of an unwritten rule that your step kids may never be close to you or even like you, and you have to make peace with that.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I didn't read anything past the Subject Line.  Who you want in your wedding is up to you, no explanations/reasons are required.\n\nIf they ask, you can provide an explanation if you want, I guess that depends on the relationship between you and them.  But you are not REQUIRED to give an explanation under any circumstance.", "My thought is if they bring it up again explain how you just can't get over him missing your first 15 birthdays. When they say something along the lines of we didn't even know each other just say EXACTLY.", "What I find so infuriating in these situations is that more often than not, the stepparent wants all this public recognition as being a parental figure and they haven't been that person. The OP has a right to pick whoever for these things, and it's grating when someone like this guy thinks they are entitled when they really have no case. Like- congrats. You weren't an AH to me during our brief time living under the same roof, and you married mom. That doesn't make you a parental figure\n\nNTA", "Give him a cinnamon roll.", "Even if he did pay for anything, you can\u2019t buy a relationship.

I refused. He didn\u2019t attend my wedding.

They want to put on their little show for everyone and pretend that you're a happily little family, but it sounds like you barely even have that relationship with your mom. He can be disappointed all he wants! It's YOUR wedding. Even if he raised you from when you were 2, that does not entitle him to a co-starring role in your day. You could have your brother or a best girl friend walk you down if that's what you decide.
