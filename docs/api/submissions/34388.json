I chose to ask my (paternal) granny. I chose not to ask mom because she and I had a less close relationship than she and my brother did growing up. My granny is the person who gave me the support I needed. My mom's husband told me it had really hurt to be publicly declared not a parent or parent figure when he has always thought of us as his kids in some way.\n\nI asked him if a special dance with mom or walking down the aisle with mom would make him feel better and he said no.

And you were already grown enough to not need parental support from him as you were heading off to college. \n\nI feel like maybe he had grown to have some great expectations when it comes to the position he has in your lives.

You offered him lovely options that apply to who he is.  You are not obligated to play daughter for his ego.  NTA.\n\nI had to play a game for my parents at my wedding when I was 23.  I'm now 67, and try as I might I cannot forget that or forgive it.  No wedding is perfect, but there are enough unexpected problems that building one in beforehand isn't wise.", "NTA.

Why does he feel that he deserves public accolades for a role he never played?\n\nLet him tantrum and have the wedding you want.", "That\u2019s actually mental to think he can be a father figure when he only even occupied a house with one for a year. Nta. It\u2019s your wedding you make the rules. Get on board or kick rocks.", "NTA, its your wedding, not his chance to be the father of the bride. You were almost an adult when he came into your life and you spent a year or so living under the same roof. How was he a \"father\" figure to you? I would love to hear that from him. Yes your father passed when you were 2 and he came in at 16 (and doesn't sound like you really ever met him while they were dating). You can have whoever you want walk you down the aisle. You could have your local mayor walk you down if you wanted, even if your dad was alive. It's just traditional to have the step/father walk you down.  My father passed away 2 years ago, when i get married I'm asking my dad's best friend to do it. Because to me having him walk with me would be like having my dad there. But my dad's best friend has been part of the family for over 60 years.

Help pay for college, or if that was not possible, try to do stuff like slip you a few bucks for gas or whatever here and there to help you out as a broke student to come home and visit?  Did he sit on the floor of your first apartment with you, putting together a bunch of ikea furniture, while alternating between Dad jokes and swearing at the insanity of Allen wrenches?  And insisting your generation\u2019s music is crap and you should put on some doobie brothers?\n\nEven if he did stuff like that, you\u2019re still not obligated to include your mother\u2019s husband in a parental place of honor in your wedding, as you just don\u2019t see him that way.  \n\nBut I\u2019m trying to parse his motivation - whether he\u2019s upset because he really sees you as his kid, or if he\u2019s upset because he wants to be publicly respected and honored *as though* he was your father?\n\nCause it\u2019s either NAH or NTA, depending.", "NTA. That would make sense to me if your mom married him when you were a small child. At 16 of course you're not going to form a parental attachment to the guy your mom married when you were halfway out the door.\n\nHis expectations are unrealistic.", "NTA. I commend you for sticking to your values despite the pressure. The truth is he hasn\u2019t acted as a father to you, likely because you did not have one for 14 years and learned not to need one. At 16, it might have been hard to create that relationship. Did he even try to do so over the subsequent years? In any case, your mother is the AH for implying that the role of father can be purchased, and not recognizing that you don\u2019t see him that way, and honoring that. You\u2019ve been very reasonable and offered alternatives. They both seem more into the idea of what others will think, than representing what is. You\u2019ve been great so far, rational and kind. You don\u2019t owe it to him. Glad your father\u2019s mother will be there for you and in some way represent your father, as well as your close relationship with her. Maybe if you want, he could light a candle with your mom for you? Some symbolic suggestion that he and your mother as a couple support you and your soon-to-be husband? Or he could do a reading of scripture or a poem you approve of during the service. Or he and your mom could do a combined toast to you both as the new couple at the reception. Lots of options to indicate he\u2019s part of the family, just not your father. You would not feel good about him playing a role at the wedding that he hasn\u2019t played in your life.

It\u2019s your day, and I hope you have a wonderful one.", "NTA.\n\nLet's be honest, he lived with you the same amount of time your dad did before he passed, just because he's still married to your mum now, doesn't mean that year or so you did live with him counts or means more. \n\nHe's not a parental figure to you. You didn't and don't see him as one. Money isn't going to change the way you see or feel about him.\n\nHe's made his stance pretty clear in his expectations of what *he* wants and feels he's entitled to.

You lived with him for such a small portion of your life that it's completely understandable that you don't see him as a father figure, at least from my perspective. I also find it completely understandable that you want your grandma to walk you down the aisle since she was your biggest supporter in life. I feel like your mom's husband wants to be the star of your special day, when you and your future spouse are supposed to be the stars. Like others have mentioned, I believe he wants to do this for bragging rights. Stand strong, and tell them that you are in control of the wedding and won't be giving in to their insistence that you change your mind about it. If they keep trying to force you to give him a role that he didn't really earn (in my opinion), I would say uninvite them from attending.", "NTA\n\nThese things are EARNED. \nHe did not earn them. \n\nYou were grown he didn\u2019t have a chance but that\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. He\u2019s really messed up if he feels entitled to this.", "So basically he wants a role out of petty and not because you genuinely want to give him a role? That to me is insulting. I would rather an honest role like you are mentioning", "NTA - both your mom and he are being ridiculous. How could he possibly be a father figure when he was not in your life to be a father.

My mom never remarried, but I can't see a reality where I would have ever looked at my mom's husband as my \"father\", especially at 15 years old. He would have simply been, and would always remain \"my mom's husband\". He has no right to try and purchase a role in your weeding. if he keeps it up he can be UN-invited. This day is about YOU and your new husband. Not your mother and her partners feelings.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t your father, wasn\u2019t a father figure, and did not do the work that would have earned him a key role in the wedding. Sucks for him, but you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA, and I applaud you for the effort you made to try to accommodate him.", "You are not being cruel.

His father remarried after my husband and 2 older sisters had already moved out and were living as independent adults. On the eve of our wedding, his father and new wife tried to pressure my husband to let them both walk him down the aisle as is a Jewish custom. My husband was firm. He wanted his father only to walk him down the aisle or he would walk alone. I stood by his decision. My husband walked down the aisle alone on our wedding day.", "I would actually encourage you from disinviting him entirely if they keep pressing the issue. At this point, they're wading deep into boundary-stomping and AH territory.", "NTA\n\nSo, it sounds like your mother's husband wants to be a part of your wedding because you, even if just as an extension of his love for your mother, are important to him. He's feeling insecure about that, though, and that's not fair to you. I think its possible you are both relating to your relationship in similar ways, but the generational divide is influencing how he perceives it. I think this is the kind of situation where some level of reassurance is totally fair, but in the end he does need to understand and respect that your wedding is reflection of YOU and YOU get to decide what that means. Being left out isn't a slight. Indeed, I would say that the husband of the mother of the bride is an inherently important role. You'll have pictures with him. You can list him in the program. You're obviously trying to find ways meet him half way, but its on him to come the rest of the way. You aren't doing anything wrong.", "NTA...I'm a step parent to 2 wonderful girls and my husband is a step parent to my 2 boys. When my husband and I got to together my kids were 18 and 25 and his kids were 12 and 15. My sons do not see him as a step father, he is my husband and honestly they mostly tell people he's their friend as they have friendships outside of me which is great. I call my bonus daughters my husband's daughter. His youngest daughter has asked if she can call me Mom insert my name when she was about 18 I told her call me what you are comfortable with. So that's what she calls me. I feel sad for her Mom but they do NOT get along at all and since I ddidn't prompt the name change and she was an adult at the time I figured it was her choice. My husband nor I expect to be seen as parent if any of our children get married. I suspect if the younger daughter ever gets married I'm gonna end up smack in the middle of her and her Mom's fights which sucks!!!", "NTA.  I'm so sorry they are trying to manipulate you this way. \n\nI never took any of my dad's wives as a mother figure, not one.  I never even called them my step-mom.  They were my dad's wife (he was married 4 times).   I do now refer to his last wife as his widow.  She was never a mom to me or a step-mom.  She is a very nice lady, and she still treats us all very well, but she is not a mom.  Just like your mom's husband is just that, her husband.  You were 16 when they got together.  That is too late in some ones life to just pop up and say \"Hey, I'm your new dad\".

Generally, she and my brother had a great relationship when we were growing up and granny filled that role for me.
