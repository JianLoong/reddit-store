I (30F) and my boyfriend (31M) had plans for me to pay for us to go out on Halloween for a night of food and drinking. I even bought us a couples costume because he wanted to dress up. Here is the issue: my boyfriend has not had any source of income for six months and has no car or place of his own (he lives with his mom). I have a car, job, and my own place. \n\nI am the one who has to make the effort to visit him every day even though we do not live very close to eachother. I still go see him every night after I get out of work at 9pm. If we want to do anything (even something inexpensive like getting snacks or a cheap fast food run) I am the one paying for it. I drive us everywhere.  We went to an expensive haunted house, I paid for it. I spend a lot of gas money and money in general to see him. Even though I am barely getting by financially. I make time for him even when I am exhausted after work and just want to go home and work on my studies. He does not always make time for me and I go days where I never see him \nbecause he sleeps +18 hours and I can\u2019t get a hold of him so he sleeps through our plans. \n\nHe has made no efforts to get his life together while I feel like I am the one who does everything for us. He was on government assistance for five years while not working until six months ago when the assitance stopped and he lost any source of income. He sits around at home hanging out with his mom or sleeps all day. I feel like he is putting in no effort for us and is not taking our relationship seriously. He is very mean to me and often not there for me mentally and emotionally. \n\nThe other night after I took us on a date he complained that I am not doing enough for him and I need to make more of an effort for him emotionally. I got very upset because I am in therapy trying to work on things (he is not) and the reason I\u2019m not there emotionally currently is because he pushes me away when I try and says he doesn\u2019t want to talk and I am stressing him out and he does not reciprocate in anything I do. I am hurt because as stated above, all the effort with us falls on me now. \n\nAfter his comment about me not doing enough I told him if he wants to drink on Halloween he can pay for himself. I feel bad going back on my word to take us out but after months of paying for him while he does nothing that was my final straw and I do not plan to pay for him anymore.

How do you see this relationship working out long term?  How long are you planning to let him suck you dry financially and emotionally before you realize you deserve a more equal partnership?", "YTA ... to yourself.  This sounds like a very one sided relationship.  How long have you been together and do you think this pattern is sustainable?", "NTA.  He is trying to make you feel bad. He does NOTHING for you; is using you and then tries to make you do more. Why are you with him? I would stop making ANY effort and see how long it takes for him to reach to you.", "NTA- I would prioritize your mental health and finances. Since he does not seem to appreciate all you do, I would stop doing any of it. He sounds exhausting, I personally would dump the guy.", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re with him.  This is a one way relationship.  Why not take a break from relationships, finish your studies and then try again when you\u2019re in a better place?", "How long is it going to take you to learn he is a dead beat and using you as a free meal ticket?", "NTA. This was a casual plan for an evening out and not a sacred oath you swore before God, so you are free to tell him that the plan no longer works for you and you're going to be doing something else. But I think that is a reasonable and fair first step toward getting you out of a relationship that is clearly not working", "What is he bringing to this relationship? He\u2019s a lazy bum who\u2019s mean to you, demanding, and dismissive. Sounds like an ex-boyfriend to me. Why would you even go out with him on Halloween? You know he\u2019s going to be a jerk all night. Just cancel and make plans with your friends.", "YTA if you stay with him. I don\u2019t understand why people stay with leaches.", "NTA, but this is one of those \"rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic\" questions where it's hard to respond to \"should you pay for him on Halloween\" without being distracted by everything else that is wrong. He hasn't had a job in five years. You're paying for dates, except when he blows you off because he's sleeping. He's mean to you. He's not grateful for any of this and thinks you should be giving him more. What in the world is attractive about this relationship to you?", "YWNBTA \n\nIf you dumped him.\n\nWhat does he have to offer you aside from his neediness?", "Sounds like you and his mom share custody of a large child.", "Is there anything about this guy that makes you happy? So far you've only listed red flags. \n\nNTA, but girl... Dump his ass", "Why are you dating him? He brings nothing to the relationship and in no way enhances your life.  \n\nI vote YTA - to yourself.", "NTA - Dump him.", "Is there a entire generation of stupid women that don\u2019t know when they\u2019re being taken advantage of? There\u2019s nothing wrong with being by yourself.

Also sounds like he is suffering from pretty standard depression. You won\u2019t fix him. But its what it sounds like to me.", "NTA you are not his girlfriend but his sugar mama. He is an adult who is perfectly capable of supporting himself yet he expects his parents and you to foot the bill. This is only going to get worse especially with his victim mentality. Break it off now before you waste more of your life being his ATM and find someone willing to be a partner not a dependent.", "NTA. Why are you with him again? He does nothing & expects everything from you.", "NTA, girl, dump him and better your life. You're burning time, money, energy and emotional bandwidth on a leech that has no plans to reciprocate.  \n\n\nHe even goes so far as to blame -you- for the lack of connection and says you need to try harder.   \n\n\nYou sound caring, competent, and reasonably successful.

What does he contribute to the relationship? 5yrs on assistance tells me 5yrs unemployed, then another 6 months of no job and no income. Plus he sleeps all the time and makes no effort to see you. He's mean to you and wants you to do more. He has no drive, there are no goals he wants to achieve.

Treat yourself better and find a real man!", "INFO\n\nWhy? Is it so important to be able to say \u201cI have a boyfriend\u201d when you actually have a leach? Really, _what_ are you getting from this relationship? Better to be alone with self respect than with a taker who doesn\u2019t show any consideration for you.
