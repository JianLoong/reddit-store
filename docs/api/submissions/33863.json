Before I had met him I struggled with eating disorders and was too skinny. I had become ill with a chronic illness and now have various health conditions leading me to gain wait and making to very hard to get any weight off. (I was bed ridden for months)\nHe met me when I was larger- he never looked at me like I was anything less than the most beautiful girl to him and always showered me with love and compliments. Though I was overweight he would never had even thought about me like that. We had spoken about it my weight loss and looking back comparing to how I look now, he has said I was fat- and even said himself that he never even noticed how big I was because he just saw \u2018how beautiful\u2019 I am. \n\nNow the problem recently is that though I have lost a lot of the fat he now looks at me like I\u2019m huge, he micromanages my eating and my weight and it feels like I\u2019m constantly getting picked on or picked apart. He doesn\u2019t look at me or treat me like he use to when I was big. \nI made a post talking about this and how on Christmas I ate more than I usually would (1200-1800cal) and because I am still affected by my disorders I immediately viewed myself as 4x larger after \u2018over\u2019 eating. \nMy partner is currently interstate, we FaceTimed to discuss our days and we talked for a while before the topic of food came up and I knew I was about to be \u2018in trouble\u2019 for eating. I just ate a meal with family and friends and a couple treats I wouldn\u2019t usually have. So it came, he judged what I had eaten and said that just because it was Christmas doesn\u2019t mean I had to \u2018eat so much\u2019 \nBecause he had responded like this and how he had been talking to me about my weight lately, I asked him out of frustration if he thought I was fat.\nHe made a couple weird noises looked me up and down and at my stomach for a while before sounding like he was going to say yes. I felt a lump in my throat and turned the camera away from me so he could no longer see me. \n\nIt was devastating and I felt that feeling of needing to st4rve myself that I use to feel when I was deep in my disordered ways.\n\nThat\u2019s really it,\nNow the comments on that og post made me question if I am somehow an asshole for snapping and asking him if he thought I was fat?\nDid I do something wrong by that?

You\u2019re seeking validation from your boyfriend and he has somehow ended up in a role of food police/accountability partner. Don\u2019t know how he ended up in this role but this would be better left in the hands of a nutritionist. \n\nThis is where you now seek a nutritionist who specializes with your past eating disorders to talk to. That means you don\u2019t bring up these type of conversations with him or you tell him you are going to discuss it with your nutritionist. You don\u2019t go into specifics with him anymore about what you ate or calories. \n\nNow you try to focus your relationship on the two of you. Your shared interests or listening to what each other are interested in. You need to refocus your relationship off of your eating habits.", "This isn\u2019t a AITA it is a relationship issue. You need to stop seeing your boyfriend and work with your counselor. Nta", "NTA - first, you should never \u201cbe in trouble\u201d for eating, unless, perhaps, you\u2019re stealing another person\u2019s food. Honestly, he didn\u2019t have to say or insinuate anything about your body for me to want you to get out of there because controlling another person\u2019s eating is abuse. Yes, you have a history of EDs and health issues, but he\u2019s not your guardian and it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing it with your health in mind. No one should be making you feel less than or an authority you report to about your choices. A partner is a partner, meaning an equal and a support.", "Indulging at Christmas will not undo all your hard work. It's a couple of days, tops, and it doesn't actually sound like you went crazy. Depending on your height/weight, you might have been eating at maintenance rather than over-eating.\n\nDo you have any ongoing support for your eating disorders? If you were too skinny and openly can't judge how you look in the mirror, it sounds like you still need someone to look out for you. Your boyfriend doesn't like he's that person - he's criticising what you eat, and we all know, telling someone off about food never makes them feel any happier or more likely to eat normally.\n\nI strongly recommend you confide in your trusted friends, a therapist and/or give an eating disorders helpline a call. You've done so well, and you really can't let this guy derail your mental progress and send you on a spiral.\n\nOnce you've had some space and you've spoken with a trusted person who has your best interests at heart, it's maybe time to reevaluate the relationship. A partner should make you feel better, happier, like the best version of yourself - not make you feel like shit and on the verge of tears all the time.", "NTA. Don't ask questions you don't want the honest answer to. \n\nYour boyfriend is not treating you right. You deserve someone who will support you and build you up. Not judge you and micromanage what you eat. He shouldn't make you feel like shit. \n\nI've gained a load of weight due to medical issues in the last few years and my hubby never makes me feel like shit. He encourages me when I say I want to make changes but still supports me if I fail at my goal.", "NTA, sounds like your partner is enabling your eating disorder, which is not healthy, mentally and physically.", "NTA - people will come on here and tell you you\u2019re the devil for being overweight however obviously that\u2019s not true and the way he\u2019s managing your food isn\u2019t healthy or normal", "Dump and block. It's not up to him to dictate and try to control you.", "NTA\n\nDitch this boyfriend though this relationship is headed nowhere good. The sooner you get out the less time you\u2019ll invest in this loser.", "Excellent advice has been offered. You no longer have a healthy relationship and it is time to take a deep breath and move on. Wishing you a more peace filled New Year.", "NTA. You are so young. Use this as a barometer for what you don\u2019t want in a future relationship. Time to move on.", "NTA\n\nWhat he's doing is absolutely no good. He's adding his own negative commentary on top of what your disorders whisper in your mind. He only started doing this *after* you lost some of the weight you gained via chronic illness / health issues. \n\nI find the whole thing baffling. But again, he really needs to stop and/or perhaps you need to get away from him. I don't know.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand how this started. It sounded like he liked you the way you were when you first met, but did a 180 and is now judging you and criticizing every food choice. It's odd. Don't let him talk to you about food anymore. He doesn't get a say anymore. And you shouldn't bring up your caloric intake with him anymore. This is just an unhealthy situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
