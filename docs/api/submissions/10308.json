I personally have always been child-free, I don't like kids and I never wanted to have any of my own. For that reason I always avoided dating single mothers. Nothing against them specifically I just don't see myself as a father/step father figure. But when I met my gf I fell in love with her even though she was a widow with two kids. She's also quite a bit older than me (I'm 28 and she's 37). \n\nEven though I don't like kids I got along with hers quite well. Maybe because they're teenagers (13 and 15) so they're not as \"childish\". Six months ago we made the decision to move in together. But ever since they moved in with me things changed with her oldest daughter. For the lack of a better word she became very clingy and needy. She would constantly nag me to spend time with her, whenever I was going out she wanted to come with me. After six months of that I just felt exhausted by it. I just can't do anything without her daughter wanting to join me. So a couple days ago I complained to my girlfriend that her daughter was a bit too clingy. She told me that her daughter just sees me as a father figure (her biological father died when she was 5) and that I was being a jerk for complaining instead of being happy that she likes me.

If I were in his shoes I would also be more than a bit uncomfortable with a teenage girl now imprinting on me. He's not her dad. These kids aren't his responsibility. Truth is, the kid probably is clingy and needy because *she experienced a traumatic loss as a child*. Which is not within OPs pay grade to navigate, so to speak. I get that she's emotionally vulnerable and wants to experience his as her father figure but that's where the mother needs to get her therapy instead of expecting the boyfriend to do the emotional heavy lifting. No, it wouldn't kill him to hang out with the kid, but again. That's on him for dating a single mother but also on the mother for continuing a relationship with a man who she knew didn't want to play dad to her kids. I wouldn't say he gets no share of blame for finding himself in this situation but I also don't think someone who made it clear what he was and wasn't willing to do for these kids is now expected to shoulder because they've moved in together.

One day, stepson (T) came to my cousin (B) and asked if B would adopt him because B was the \"the kind of dad I'd really like to have.\"  B was overjoyed because he'd recently started trying to figure out how to ask T if B could adopt him because he was a \"pretty cool son.\"  B and his wife had a daughter (H) together.

My second thought was also her teen daughter having a crush on him which is all kinds of nope and any rational adult would be wildly uncomfortable in that situation. And if I were these girls mother, I'd also be a little more leery about my 15 year old daughter now seemingly wanting to follow my much younger boyfriend like a puppy.
