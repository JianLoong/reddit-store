Nothing against them specifically I just don't see myself as a father/step father figure. But when I met my gf I fell in love with her even though she was a widow with two kids. She's also quite a bit older than me (I'm 28 and she's 37). \n\nEven though I don't like kids I got along with hers quite well. Maybe because they're teenagers (13 and 15) so they're not as \"childish\". Six months ago we made the decision to move in together. But ever since they moved in with me things changed with her oldest daughter. For the lack of a better word she became very clingy and needy. She would constantly nag me to spend time with her, whenever I was going out she wanted to come with me. After six months of that I just felt exhausted by it. I just can't do anything without her daughter wanting to join me. So a couple days ago I complained to my girlfriend that her daughter was a bit too clingy. She told me that her daughter just sees me as a father figure (her biological father died when she was 5) and that I was being a jerk for complaining instead of being happy that she likes me.

If I were in his shoes I would also be more than a bit uncomfortable with a teenage girl now imprinting on me. He's not her dad. These kids aren't his responsibility. Truth is, the kid probably is clingy and needy because *she experienced a traumatic loss as a child*. Which is not within OPs pay grade to navigate, so to speak. I get that she's emotionally vulnerable and wants to experience his as her father figure but that's where the mother needs to get her therapy instead of expecting the boyfriend to do the emotional heavy lifting. No, it wouldn't kill him to hang out with the kid, but again. That's on him for dating a single mother but also on the mother for continuing a relationship with a man who she knew didn't want to play dad to her kids. I wouldn't say he gets no share of blame for finding himself in this situation but I also don't think someone who made it clear what he was and wasn't willing to do for these kids is now expected to shoulder because they've moved in together.

YTA. If you move in to a house with 2 children, you are in complete denial if you think those kids won\u2019t get attached to you. Either leave this situation right now, before you do even more damage, or if you are truly in love with this woman, step up and learn how to be a father, even if there is always a bit in your head that thinks it all sucks, you can still behave in a good father way. You are an adult, they are children, which means this is ALL on you to protect their feelings and emotional health. This is probably why you (rightly so, it seems) didn\u2019t want kids. Think about this very seriously, as what decision you make can become the difference between some pain now that is something everyone can recover from, to a whole lot of burning, searing, emotional trauma which will come from years of living with a father-figure who wants nothing to do with the kids, which is something that will have consequences for both childrens future relationships and ability to trust and develop intimacy with others.
