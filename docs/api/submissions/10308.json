I personally have always been child-free, I don't like kids and I never wanted to have any of my own. For that reason I always avoided dating single mothers. Nothing against them specifically I just don't see myself as a father/step father figure. But when I met my gf I fell in love with her even though she was a widow with two kids. She's also quite a bit older than me (I'm 28 and she's 37). \n\nEven though I don't like kids I got along with hers quite well. Maybe because they're teenagers (13 and 15) so they're not as \"childish\". Six months ago we made the decision to move in together. But ever since they moved in with me things changed with her oldest daughter. For the lack of a better word she became very clingy and needy. She would constantly nag me to spend time with her, whenever I was going out she wanted to come with me. After six months of that I just felt exhausted by it. I just can't do anything without her daughter wanting to join me. So a couple days ago I complained to my girlfriend that her daughter was a bit too clingy. She told me that her daughter just sees me as a father figure (her biological father died when she was 5) and that I was being a jerk for complaining instead of being happy that she likes me.

Dude she has not had a father and whether you like it or not by moving in and perusing a relationship with a woman with two children that is now you.\n\n  You need to really think about this relationship and if you want to be a part of this family. I read lots of these where the childfree partner is like 'well they will move out at 18'... First of all that's rare. And second NO. If you stay with this woman those children are indefinitely an intimate part of her life, now and forever. They might also have children at some point and you'll have to interact with those children as well. There is no near future with this woman where it will be you and her without those kids.

I didn't object to dating someone with ( older) kids but ended up falling for a guy with an 8 year old. I enjoyed her company and she really really enjoyed mine, as I'm great with kids. I did dote on her and we did spend some one on one time together. Then it got a little bit...much. BF started asking me to pick her up from school more often...always wanting to stay at my house whenever he had her as we didn't live together and thus felt pressured. I found out some lies he had told me about his finances ( he was basically broke) and I was doing quite well. We only dated 3 1/2 months and even though I did genuinely love the guy ( and his daughter) I was just not up to raising another child and didn't see it working out between us especially given our financial disparity.

Do I think OP was short sighted and frankly more than a bit dumb in deciding to continue on with a single mother knowing he doesn't like kids? Yeah, absolutely. But everyone acting like he slapped this girl in the face and kicked her out of is way is a tad much. If I were in his shoes I would also be more than a bit uncomfortable with a teenage girl now imprinting on me. He's not her dad. These kids aren't his responsibility. Truth is, the kid probably is clingy and needy because *she experienced a traumatic loss as a child*. Which is not within OPs pay grade to navigate, so to speak. I get that she's emotionally vulnerable and wants to experience his as her father figure but that's where the mother needs to get her therapy instead of expecting the boyfriend to do the emotional heavy lifting. No, it wouldn't kill him to hang out with the kid, but again. That's on him for dating a single mother but also on the mother for continuing a relationship with a man who she knew didn't want to play dad to her kids. I wouldn't say he gets no share of blame for finding himself in this situation but I also don't think someone who made it clear what he was and wasn't willing to do for these kids is now expected to shoulder because they've moved in together. What did she expect to happen? He'd wake up one day and magically like kids?", "you really think that Op cannot approach a kid and ask \"what is going on, why do you wanna be with me this often?\"  \n\n\ninstead of being like: get out of my face...."]}
