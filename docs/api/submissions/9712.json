My sister is deaf and in that subculture. Can you imagine how it feels to take speech lessons, never having heard speech? And be mocked if you don't master it?

Can you imagine being taught to speak in sign language from the time you were a baby, and then being forced to learn to read, but the sentence structure is completely different and some of the words don't even exist in sign language and vice versa?  Can you imagine writing a beautiful poem, but it's lost on everyone because words that rhyme or are powerful in sign don't translate well in writing or speech?

Yes, they could communicate in plain English, but that can be embarrassing for deaf people. Because of the way sentences are structured in sign language, it can be quite hard to master 'basic writing skills' in a way that makes people take them seriously. This can be the case even if they have a high IQ. My sister has a college degree, (more than me.) but you'd never guess it from just communicating back and forth. Can you imagine being ostracized from society and even your own family for something that is pointless and beyond your control? Deaf people don't see being deaf as a disability. Hearing is something they've never had, and have come to realize it's not something you need to live an amazing life. They aren't assholes.

This can make it harder because the parents need to learn ASL to be able to teach their children simple things that we take for granted. \n\nHearing parents with hearing kids --kid cries, parent asks \"are you thirsty\" kid hears this often enough and connects thirst to what he's feeling. \n\nHearing parent that doesn't know signs, kid cries, parent gets kid a drink. The child doesn't learn the word or concept that goes with it passively like a hearing child does. \n\nSome make their own home signs which don't work when communicating with those outside the house. \n\nWe pick up a lot of things passively so it takes extra effort for hearing parents of Deaf children to teach them appropriately (okay, I'm getting them a drink, let me sign drink to them so they learn the word).\n\nI hope that makes sense. Sign language is beautiful, but there's definitely a learning curve just for the language in addition to using it to teach child born to family that is unfamiliar with deafness.", "It is common for teachers to struggle with teaching literacy to Deaf students. That doesn't mean Deaf students can't learn, it means we don't know how to teach them effectively.\n\nThe statistic OP threw out there was a misquote of a study from the year 2000 that was about SAT Reading Comprehension scores, not the overall literacy of Deaf high school graduates.

It's like 20 years old and refers to the median, not the average, which are two totally different numbers. Using the median at the time of that problematic statistic, hearing students graduated at a 5th grade reading level.\n\nIn reality, deaf people statistically read at a higher level than hearing people because it's how they communicate with the majority.
