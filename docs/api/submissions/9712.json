It may be worth looking into.\n\nCan your co-worker read lips?", "NTA. It\u2019s up to your company to make proper accommodations for a deaf employee. It is not part of your job and it\u2019s an unreasonable request. If they hire a French only speaker, will they expect you to learn French?", "NTA. The company doesn't want to provide nor pay for what I'm sure are legally mandated accommodations for the coworker. So they are unloading it onto you, and STILL don't want to pay for your lessons. Like wtf is this? It's their responsibility to ensure the employee with a disability can communicate with their coworkers and that they can perform their work correctly.", "NTA. It is unreasonble for them to request that from you as learning takes time and money and not everyone has those things.", "NTA- they actually have a legal responsibility to ensure your coworker is able to communicate with you.", "NTA. If your employer wants to be inclusive and support their deaf employee then they should be giving you work time and paying for you to have lessons. They are asking a big commitment from you at your expense and in your time. \n\nIf I was in your position though I would ask the colleague to teach you some basic signs. It's a great opportunity while you are talking with your colleague to learn some of their language to facilitate communication.", "NTA - that is a ridiculous request from an employer", "NTA \nIt's the employer's responsibility to make accommodations. Now, if they wanted to incentivize you to do it - pay for classes and your time to take them - and you still don't want to do it...the area gets a smidge grayer, but I think would still fall on NTA territory. But at that point you should probably question if this job is a good fit for you.", "NTA\n\n\"Learn sign language\".  On your own dime?  F that.\n\nA \"reasonable accommodation\" would be your employer assigning a sign language interpreter to them in order to assist in communicating with everyone else, including for phone communications.  They could also help you by paying for classes or training in signing during work hours at their expense.  If for some reason it is an unfeasible ask, if you're American, some states **will** pay for the accommodation for you (OVR offices would have that info).  That's not on you.  It's an ADA thing.

If I were you I'd get in touch with the local Deaf Resource Center, they'll have more resources for holding your boss accountable and helping get the accommodations your coworker needs.\n\nAs much as it'd be great if everyone knew sign language, it takes time and energy to learn a new language and learn it well. ASL fluency was not an expectation of the job when you were hired and if it's required now then they need to pay to train you in it.", "Info:  Has there been a discussion with your boss or anyone in HR (if there is an HR dept) about providing you time or compensation to learn sign language?\n\nWhat type of work are you doing?  If you're in an office you can always use chat programs to communicate.  If you're in the service sector, it is going to be more difficult.\n\nThat being said, I have a friend, John, who was paired with a deaf assistant crew-boss, Bill, on a wildland firefighting crew.  John didn't know sign-language but Bill did read lips well.  He taught John enough signs and how to spell out things using the alphabet that they had a great partnership.  John has been able to use what little he learned in other situations.  No one was compensated extra for teaching or learning, but both people made it work.  It wasn't hard and in the end they were rewarded with a good working relationship.", "How can you not communicate via text? I managed to communicate just fine with the Ukranian woman who cleaned my employer's home and between the two of us we knew like 6 words in common. We used the Google translate app and it was fine.\n\nI could understand if it was advanced physics or something, but it doesn't seem too hard to learn the few basic signs you need to know and just write notes for the rest when it comes to cleaning homes.

But your question was about your boss expecting you to take classes and yeah, they definitely need to pay for your time to learn. \n\nI will say though, a lot of deaf people, especially ones who went to deaf schools rather than having translators in public schools, write how they speak. ASL grammar is entirely different and it can make things confusing and make the person seem \"dumb\". Usually they can understand you perfectly and know how to write \"correctly\" for essays and such, but for casual writing they write how they would speak. Lip reading is also a super difficult skill and a lot of deaf people actually can't do it. I spent years in speech therapy and I can't do it.

My sister is deaf and in that subculture. Can you imagine how it feels to take speech lessons, never having heard speech? And be mocked if you don't master it? Can you imagine finding it arbitrary being forced to learn how to learn to read lips when others could just as easily learn sign language but they just don't care to? Can you imagine being taught to speak in sign language from the time you were a baby, and then being forced to learn to read, but the sentence structure is completely different and some of the words don't even exist in sign language and vice versa?  Can you imagine writing a beautiful poem, but it's lost on everyone because words that rhyme or are powerful in sign don't translate well in writing or speech? Or coming up with a brilliant idea, but it's not received well because you can't write it out wirh the proper grammar because it's not needed for sign,  and you can't speak very well.... but your other deaf friends immediately understand your brilliance? Yes, they could communicate in plain English, but that can be embarrassing for deaf people. Because of the way sentences are structured in sign language, it can be quite hard to master 'basic writing skills' in a way that makes people take them seriously. This can be the case even if they have a high IQ. My sister has a college degree, (more than me.) but you'd never guess it from just communicating back and forth. Can you imagine being ostracized from society and even your own family for something that is pointless and beyond your control? Deaf people don't see being deaf as a disability. Hearing is something they've never had, and have come to realize it's not something you need to live an amazing life. They aren't assholes. Some people like that have just grown resentful to a point they don't trust the hearing to ever understand and are wary of letting anyone with hearing in their lives.\n\nThat being said. OP is NTA.

Some people like that have just grown resentful to a point they don't trust the hearing to ever understand and are wary of letting anyone with hearing in their lives.\n\nRight, so they're resentful of people who aren't disabled, and somehow you think it's a reasonable expectation for others to learn to sign when 99.9 percent of people are hearing? Would you suggest that everyone learn Hindi so they can talk to the few immigrants in town? Or do you think it's more reasonable for the disabled person to make an effort to integrate themself into society? \"Everyone else should learn a largely useless skill to accommodate me\" is hardly reasonable. \n\nMy grandparents are immigrants. They didn't demand that everyone else learn their language...\n\nAlso, being deaf IS a disability. It's the very definition of one. If it's not, then I'm not being ableist lmao.

It is up to the employer to provide the employee with the tools needed to do the job. This includes coworkers with he or she can communicate.
