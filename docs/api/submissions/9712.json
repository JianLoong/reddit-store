My sister is deaf and in that subculture. Can you imagine how it feels to take speech lessons, never having heard speech? And be mocked if you don't master it?

Can you imagine being taught to speak in sign language from the time you were a baby, and then being forced to learn to read, but the sentence structure is completely different and some of the words don't even exist in sign language and vice versa?  Can you imagine writing a beautiful poem, but it's lost on everyone because words that rhyme or are powerful in sign don't translate well in writing or speech?

Yes, they could communicate in plain English, but that can be embarrassing for deaf people. Because of the way sentences are structured in sign language, it can be quite hard to master 'basic writing skills' in a way that makes people take them seriously. This can be the case even if they have a high IQ. My sister has a college degree, (more than me.) but you'd never guess it from just communicating back and forth. Can you imagine being ostracized from society and even your own family for something that is pointless and beyond your control? Deaf people don't see being deaf as a disability.

Having to hire a interpreter for a cleaning company is a very high cost. So it\u2019s not logical to hire someone to do that.", "You're really spamming this? Damn, you really hate deaf people *that much*? Embarrassing.", "I think you missed the entire point. They aren't resentful that 99.9% of people aren't deaf or don't speak sign language, and they don't expect others to learn sign language unless that person wants a relationship with them. Rather, from birth, they face extreme pressure to adapt their lives to be a 'normal' that they literally can't comprehend. Being deaf IS normal. I've known deaf people who get cochlear implants and don't use them because they find sound so intrusive and obnoxious and feel sorry for hearing people. But if they can't speak or write or read lips perfectly they are viewed as somehow deficient or subpar no matter how hard they try. Over time, that's led to a tit-for-tat attitude 'if you aren't deaf, that's not my problem.' Also, although I'm familiar with the sub culture you're referring to, and that's not not how most deaf people are.", "And sometimes you miss the more obvious pattern", "That\u2019s never happened to me. And there is a significant chance it never will. The statistics bear that out.", "OP is the one needing accommodation. They already stated that their job is in domestic cleaning. That's pretty ableist of you to say that a qualified deaf person needs to be able to communicate fluently to coworkers in a manner that their coworker feels comfortable with to perform their essential job functions as a domestic cleaner.", "Warning: troll user, completely useless.", "Warning: troll user, completely useless.", "It's a day-old account. Seems more than possible they already got banned and made a new one.", "No, I know exactly what you're getting at. I have well above average customer service skills, but no matter how well I've treated the deaf in the past, I've met too many deaf assholes to not notice it.\n\nHearing customers love me /shrug", "Yes I see that most people don\u2019t care about minorities at least your honest", "It is not about nondisabled employees comfort. \n\nIt is that all employees need to communicate fluently. \n\nPeople with hearing disabilities sometimes need help to communicate fluently- not a judgment, but a need- so you fix that need by finding the tools for support.\n\nThe deaf coworker is legally getting paid less anyways, so the workplace can spend the difference and at the very least, pay $$ to train someone in ASL.", "If OP and their deaf coworker need to communicate more smoothly for their jobs, then OP's situation shows that the deaf person is not being sufficiently accommodated. Why aren't they raising the issue? Probably because employers find ways to punish that and they've been conditioned not to take up space. Or they just don't care. \n\nTheir profession was not in the post and frankly not relevant beyond 'is effective and easy communication between them necessary or not' which is why I simply said, 'if.' Conditional statements are not universal assertions. \n\nAnd no, OP is not the one needing accommodation. Disabilities are accomodated, and the impacts are not necessarily restricted to the individual with the disability. Sometimes other employees will have to change routes as part of that accommodation. Sometimes other employees will have knock-on issues arise from that accommodation. It all needs to be considered.", "So you're only an asshole to the deaf customers, good to know.", "Obviously.", "I voted the way I did because it seemed like a case of the company leaving workers to fend for themselves.   Sending texts is also not accommodation. It sounds like a (very common) situation in which the employer goes \"meh, figure it out\", and I've seen a lot of that. Many times, disabled employees do not require accommodations and try to do their best without it because they feel scared of demanding it in fear of getting fired. So the deaf emplyee not being the one asking for accommodations does not speak much about the situation.\n\nI don't like the way the OP talked about their cowoker, but I admit I do read this situation as labour law issue first and foremost, because I've seen a lot along these lines. And it still does sound like the company is going \"meh, figure it out yourself. The deaf one can read texts, or you learn ASL, figure it out, not my problem\".\n\nBut. If there are accommodations in place and the company is doing what they need, AND the deaf employee is happy with acccommodations, then it is indeed the issue of the OP's prejudice.", "Yeah, I didn't like the way they spoke of the coworker. If they do have acommodations provided, then it's a different story altogether. Speech to text software also works the same way.", "Nice try, bucko.", "If it was the disabled employee complaining, or even if one solid thing was named, I would agree with you, but the OP* reads a bit like ableist discomfort.\n\nEdit for clarification", "From the ADA website:\n\nThe ADA requires reasonable accommodations as they relate to three aspects of employment: 1) ensuring equal opportunity in the application process; 2) enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 3) making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.\n\nOP's deaf coworker doesn't need accommodations to perform the essential functions of their job as a domestic cleaner. OP's job isn't required to provide them with sign language classes as they aren't protected by the ADA. It would be a totally different situation if the deaf coworker asked for accommodations and was denied.", "True, the OP seems frustrated with the coworker more than anyone. But a disabled worker not complaining and not demanding accommodations is sadly a common thing. Many don't, in fear of getting fired. So I wouldn't take the lack of complaining as an absolute proof that the deaf cowoker is satisfied with accommodations.", "Again, the fact the deaf worker did not ask for accommodations doesn't mean much, because disabled workers often don't. That being said, it all depends on how we read \"are they able to perform duties\" - if they work in teams, then agreeing on different aspects of work to be performed is essential. But true, the way the law is written, \"communicating with coworkers\" is not explicitly given as a must, so it looks like it's not mandatory. I admit I assumed it was.", "Agreed. The fear of asking for accommodations is a real factor. Yet, the OP hasn't shown much compassion or concern for the deaf employee, only for himself as a result of having to deal with someone with \"a 4th grade reading level.\" Honestly, it was the OP's decision to poison the well with that little tidbit that crystallized my position. \n\nRegardless, there seems to be very little disagreement between us. Thank you for the civil discussion.", "In THIS scenario, the fact that the deaf coworker did not ask for accommodations and instead OP asked for accommodations for themselves means everything.", "True. I admit I formed my answer based on the experiences with companies not wanting to provide accommodations that I saw red and did not read carefully the warning signs in OP language (the way they spoke of the coworker).\n\nIn which case it's most probably ESH- the OP for discriminating, and company not caring. Unless the company indeed did everything correctly but the \"learn ASL, idk?\" answer seems to point out at them not even thinking about the issue. \n\nStill, you are absolutely correct in that the way the OP speaks of their coworker is ableist."]}
