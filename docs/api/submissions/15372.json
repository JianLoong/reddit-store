All week she\u2019s been so excited and she wanted to dress up nice. So basically friends would dress up and have a nice dinner at this venue. So I paid for the food, venue, cake, decorations, hair, nails, makeup and outfit. It was sorta like a Quince.\n\nSo everyone gets there and is all having a good time. Daughter arrived a minute later after everyone and she looked gorgeous. After about 45 minutes of talking it was time for photos and other activities, but when her mom(my wife) came up to her, she smashed cake and the cupcakes in her face. All her friends all joined in because they thought she wouldn\u2019t care, as at all her last parties she loved the cake smashes. (Except all the last parties were chill and she didn\u2019t dress up or do anything big like this one) Then my wife took it too far and put some of the Mac and cheese on her. I told everyone to cut it out and Needless to say my daughter cried instantly and was crying about her hair and makeup. Her mom laughed and said that she needed to chill out and it was just a little prank.\n\nI went and tried to wipe the cake and cheese off but it was so much icing, cheese sauce, and cake in her hair which made it very sticky and her face was covered in it that she could barely open her eyes. We couldn\u2019t even see her face. She was crying saying that the cake was burning her eyes and the party felt ruined and she didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. I tried to convince her to let me try to wipe it off and we can try and continue it. Her mom told her that she\u2019s being dramatic, and it\u2019s not that serious. \n\nThat made her cry even more, she really didn\u2019t want to be here so I just took her outside to see if it would put her at ease and she said that she didn\u2019t want to waste the money I spent, but wanted to go home. So I told everyone inside the situation, that the party may be cancelled and my wife told me that our daughter and I was being dramatic as it was just a cake smash and she should suck it up and take a joke. I told her that I would\u2019ve maybe been funny if she hadn\u2019t been excited about this all week, spent hours in a chair getting her makeup and hair done and also trying to pick an outfit. \n\nMy wife rolled her eyes and said that I\u2019m raising her to be a entitled spoiled brat who won\u2019t take jokes. I told her that the shit wasn\u2019t funny and she\u2019s acting immature as hell right now so I left and took my daughter back to the house to get cleaned up. Which took about an hour for her to get all the icing and the cheese out of her hair since the icing just basically stiffened it. At that point, most people had already left after birthday girl left. My wife got home and started yelling saying guests were leaving and the party was a disaster all because I decided to feed into a spoilt temper tantrum. It lead to an argument and she\u2019s giving the silent treatment.\n\nAITA?\n\n((For people asking, my daughter and her mom has always had a good relationship. I haven\u2019t seen any signs of my wife being jealous, but I work and am not at home most of the time a lot so I\u2019m not sure. I will be asking my daughter when she feels up to talking, as she\u2019s still upset right now.))", "created_utc": 1682122658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uo2uh/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_home_on_her_birthday/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just you & her.", "Nta and ill never understand why humiliating people is seen as a harmless prank.", "Needless to say my daughter cried instantly and was crying about her hair and makeup. Her mom laughed and said that she needed to chill out and it was just a little prank.\n\nRight here is when the bully showed up,and that bully stayed all night. I can\u2019t believe this. OP,has there been any other signs of this behavior on your wife\u2019s part? It would be odd if this is something brand new. \n\nAlso,no doubt NTA.", "Seriously! This is giving me mother is jealous of her own daughter vibes\u2026 so icky what a garbage mother", "I never understood the cake smashing thing. It isn't funny to me, especially at more formal events where you just spent a bunch of money on makeup, hair and outfits. Plus it is a waste of perfectly good food. \n\nAnd then other people joining in! That's crazy! I would cry too. If it is a tradition then maybe one little cupcake, but even then I would be mad.", "I literally just saw a post where the bakers put chopsticks inside the cake to help stabilize it and a girl got hurt from being smashed into the cake. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31", "I kept hoping to see an edit saying \"ex-wife\" bc she is straight up abusive.\n\nNTA OP", "There is something seriously wrong with your wife. Is she mentally I\u2019ll, narcissistic, borderline personality disorder, evil? A humiliating prank is down right mean. Laughing and ridiculing your daughter is abusive. You need to find out right now what else your wife is doing to undermine your daughter\u2019s self esteem and confidence. NTA but if you don\u2019t protect your child from her mother you will be.", "Ditto,  I hate cake smashing.", "She's a bully, plain and simple. Mean girl, through and through.", "I\u2019m not a doctor or mental health professional, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say ALOT is wrong with the wife.  This was just wave out of line.  I would think the wife has some major jealousy issues going on here.  Or maybe some fears of growing older because her daughter is growing up.  \n\nOP\u2019s daughter was trying to celebrate her new maturity by dressing up and all that.  Mother wants a food fight with a 12 year old.  \n\nThis was a huge attack on her daughter\u2019s sense of herself at a very difficult time for a young woman.  I think that some major work will need to be done to repair their relationship.", "This is word for word what I was going to say.. so yeah NTA", "I bet she is jealous", "Sadly, this is probably so true. The mother is this cruel for fun (I mean, FFS mac n cheese?!?) what kind of crap is she going to do out of anger?", "Great comment & Happy Cake Day!", "Yes, this.", "What do you think the daughter did that sucks?", "How is the daughter an asshole?", "What did the daughter do? The wife is a major asshole. I can kind of excuse the friends since they were following mom\u2019s lead and are kids, but OP and daughter seem blameless to me.", "I thought the same - this sounds like petty jealousy on the moms part.", "I think the cake smashing thing came from a tradition that is called \"mordida\" in Mexico, which involves the birthday person biting a small part of the cake after singing the birthday song, and then someone playfully pushing their face into the cake, usually resulting in a little bit of frosting on their face. (But there\u2019s people like the mother from this story) Since covid started, people have toned down this tradition and now usually only do it after the birthday person has already cut a slice of cake and with their consent", "You should see the video of the candle not going out properly and a little boys face being pushed into it. Stupid \u2018prank\u2019 can be very dangerous", "Saw a picture here on reddit somewhere where the bakery put big toothpick things in the cake for support and it went into the woman's eye. Definitely not a fan", "Yep, same. Wife sounds spiteful and like she doesn\u2019t even like her poor daughter.", "How does a woman become jealous of her daughter?  Genuinely curious, I am a parent", "Do you really think they included a child in that?? Use your head.", "Mexican here. Absolutely hate this tradition, especially when people don't just do a little shove and just smash you down as far as you can go - cause the more stuff on your face, the funnier, I guess.\n\nBut I remember classmates/friends growing up that had this done to them and their glasses got ruined or their eyes hurt. It's just kinda barbaric.", "Thank you!  I love hearing about the origins of traditions and such."]}
