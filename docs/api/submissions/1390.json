Today at lunch Beca took her keys off her waist and put them in the side pocket of her bag, and then walked off to talk to another friend of ours. Ashley grabbed her keys and said \u201cshh don\u2019t tell her\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought it was a quick joke. But instead Ashley dragged it out. Beca came back when lunch was over and was looking for her keys to put them back on her waist. And of course they weren\u2019t there. So she asks if we\u2019ve seen them and we say no. So she asks our other friends and they all tell her that they haven\u2019t seen her keys. I pulled Ashley aside and asked her for Becas keys back and she said that she had them and that it was fine all the while I\u2019m asking for the keys. We keep walking around because Beca is looking for her \u201clost\u201d keys and she\u2019s asking teachers if they\u2019ve seen them. Beca started to panic because she couldn\u2019t find them and I was trying to get the keys back from Ashley. I started to feel bad for Beca and annoyed with Ashley because it was unnecessary at that point. What could\u2019ve been a quick one minute joke like \u201care these the lost keys\u201d. \n\nAfter Ashley said she would give back the keys Beca started talking to herself about how she would get yelled at for losing her keys. And that her parents would tell her how irresponsible she is and that she\u2019s going to get in trouble. So I tried to find where Ashley put the keys while Beca kept trying to find them, and then looked as if she was about to cry. So I yelled at Ashley and told her to give the keys back. Ashley then laughed and said that it was just a joke. \n\nBeca then took her keys back and looked at Ashley like she was upset. Which is understandable, and went to our seventh period class. When we got home I told Ashley she needed to say sorry, and she yelled at me saying that I had no right try and take the keys. And that it was just a joke, and that if Beca couldn\u2019t take a joke at 14 then she had bigger problems than lost keys. Then she yelled at me saying how she\u2019s the older sister and that I need to respect her. Our mom and dad think that we\u2019re arguing just to argue and told us that Beca probably was overreacting.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667596680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymaqpb/aita_for_saying_that_my_sister_needs_to_apologize/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like she just wouldn\u2019t stay in one place so when she finally stood still, that\u2019s when I saw her getting ready to cry and took the keys back finally. Had she stayed still I would\u2019ve told her. But she was off like a shot each time someone said they hadn\u2019t seen the keys.", "I think it was supposed to be like you take something when someone isn\u2019t looking for a couple of seconds while they\u2019re confused and then you just give it back. No harm no foul in that because the two of us play together like that all the time. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t understand why she took something so important. Plus Beca is a kind of high strung kid already, she said that her doctor thinks she has social anxiety. So it was just unneeded stress.", "So you speak up the minute you see her. \u201cHey Beca, Ashley has your keys\u201d before she had the chance to ask anyone or run off it takes seconds or get up and follow her, yell after her. \n\nNTA- for telling your sister she needs to apologise because she should but so should you for taking part you did try to get the keys back but you should have spoken up immediately when she asked especially if you know she has social anxiety. Your young so you get a little pass especially if you apologise but you need to know that it was mean and in future behaviour that should be avoided. Your sister needs to learn that too and your parents are jerks here for not helping to teach her that just because it\u2019s ok at home with someone you know well doesn\u2019t mean you can do it to others and especially not for an extended period.", "Well if your sister didn't have that type of relationship with your friend she shouldn't be doing it.", "That\u2019s what I tried to explain to her. Like you guys aren\u2019t even that close and you\u2019re joking around like that. And she just kept telling me how she was joking and that it wasn\u2019t that serious, and that since she\u2019s older she doesn\u2019t have to do anything I say.", "At this point she won't apologize. Just let it go and maybe not hangout with your friend when your sister is around."]}
