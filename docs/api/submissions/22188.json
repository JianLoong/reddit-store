{"id": 22188, "submission_id": "14z6emp", "title": "AITA for not Forgiving my MIL when She's Nosy and Disrespected Me (IMO)?", "selftext": "Final Edit to Conclude & Clarify:\n\nThank you so much to everyone for your time and candid, insightful perspectives. I've learned a lot reading through it and want to summarize as well as provide some answers to your questions below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There's cultural misunderstanding and expectations misunderstanding (I like to be left alone, she likes to show that family should be caring).  \n2. Maybe my MIL is caring, however, I conclude that our personalities don't fit. It's like you love someone but not the way they want. Also, I have never done or said anything rude to her (don't like confrontations). I sound like a drama queen here because I'm upset, but I'm not reacting rudely to MIL, I promise. The decision not to invest in a relationship with her is my solution to avoid things like this from happening again. For reference, her husband (FIL) was also told but never said anything to me. When MIL blurted it out, he was super embarrassed. \n3. A few comments were dissing the Asian culture value I brought up. I apologize that I used the term \"Asian\" too loosely here. In my country/culture, we don't ask about people's bad experiences because it might be seen as being happy about their misfortune. And my Mom sharing with me about my Dad's health is not gossiping though. \n4. Why am I not madder at my husband vs. my MIL? \n\n* I was mad, we argued and are trying to decide what to do in the future. It's not a deal breaker for me. He is a good husband in other aspects, and we never had issues like this before. I don't like the idea of not sharing with my partner, but maybe I'll implement it depending on the situation.\n* I was neutral to MIL before this, not much interaction. So when things happen, I am less forgiving, I guess? I treat it like friendships. If you're mad at your close friend, you'll try to work it out if possible. But if there's a random acquaintance that offended you, even if not intentionally, you might want to move on and not engage.\n* Why was I upset at MIL? Because she was explicitly told not to say anything to me, but she did it anyway, both times. I was only upset when she did it again despite my stating that I'm uncomfortable. The most confusing thing to me is it clearly damaged her son's reputation and marriage (she knew he told her a secret, and she busted him?).\n\nI feel better and am able to understand other perspectives now. Thanks again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: A year ago, my Dad was diagnosed with cancer. I (34F Asian) learned it from my Mom because Dad never told me. He didn\u2019t want me to worry (just had a baby) and he hates appearing weak/sick in front of us. Culturally, we don\u2019t like to discuss our misfortune. I respect his choice, I\u2019m sure he knew that Mom told me, but we both pretend that we didn\u2019t know. I was of course sad, so I shared with my husband, and explained the situation to him. I asked him to please not check in with my Dad, and not tell anyone, especially his parents because they might ask my Dad. I also process negative emotions better on my own, so I don\u2019t need to talk about it. He understood and let me do the healing.\n\nIncident: Six months later, we visited his parents in Europe. His Mom suddenly asked me: \u201cI heard about your dad, I\u2019m sorry, how is he doing?\u201d I was shocked and said thanks for asking. Well, I actually don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing. I didn\u2019t say anything to her but was very upset at my husband. He apologized and said that it slipped her mind even though he told them not to ask, and that she cared about me and her intentions are good. I did not appreciate it but let it be. I understand that he\u2019s close to them and when I confided in him, I accepted that risk. He talked to her and she wanted to apologize but I said no, because I don\u2019t like confrontations like this.\n\nMy Dad underwent surgery and chemo and we were hopeful. Four months later, his Mom visited and stayed with us. During this trip, I received the news (from my Mom) that they still found cancer cells in his results. I was devastated, my Dad is only in his 60s. By now you can guess what happened next. I shared with my husband and emphasized that he needed to keep it private.\n\nThe NEXT DAY, when I was driving my MIL, she asked me: \u201cI just heard the bad news about your Dad, how is he doing?\u201d I was thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know, he\u2019s probably dying, but thanks.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything back, drove home, and told my husband in front of her what happened, then I walked away.\n\nMy husband was very upset at her (probably yelling) and initially apologized to me. I said I don\u2019t want anything to do with her anymore since doing things that hurt me twice in a row is not respecting me. It\u2019s like you gossip behind someone\u2019s back and then tell them about it. Who does that, really? I also told him that I understand he likes to share with his parents, that\u2019s fine, but she can\u2019t just get nosy and ask me things that I\u2019m not comfortable discussing. Now he thinks I\u2019m overreacting and \u201cshe has good intentions and cares about me\u201d etc. and I\u2019m horrible for holding grudges.\n\nSo AH judgers, AITA for not forgiving my MIL? And she\u2019s coming again in Sept, how should I treat her? I haven\u2019t spoken to her since.\n\nEDIT for INFO: My husband explicitly told her that she cannot ask my Dad or myself about it, both times. She knows that it would make me uncomfortable, especially after the first time she did it.\n\nWhy am I not mad at my husband? Yes I was, but in relationships, you share intimate things with your partner. Sometimes, they share it with their parents/friends. It does happen. I can understand it. What I don't get is why would she confronts me when she knows it will cause her son trouble?", "created_utc": 1689309317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z6emp/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mil_when_shes_nosy_and/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless, once his mom knew, it was her very natural instinct to to ask you about it. Doing so is her way of caring about you. You don\u2019t like that? Fine. But you have to use your words to communicate to your MIL that you find her asking after your father invasive and cruel. So, when she says, \u201cI heard about your dad. I\u2019m so sorry. How are you?\u201d, your response needs to be \u201cI\u2019m unwilling to comment on my dad or my feelings. I find this line of questioning incredibly invasive and intrusive.

I get that you\u2019re overwhelmed, but you\u2019re focusing your anger in the wrong direction. \n\nHow should you treat her? Like a person who cares about you. She\u2019s not the bad guy here.

You have a husband problem.", "I am going against the grain here, but YTA. Firstly, your anger is misdirected. \n\nSecondly, if you are this unwilling to share information about your life, maybe you shouldn't have married someone who tends to share things with people who I assume he sees as his support network. It seems that your boundaries are not compatible with his relationship with his family.", "I'm sorry but this is a husband problem, when he did it the first time and his mom didn't respect you or even him he shouldn't have done it again and that is 100% on him, he did learn his AH behavior from somewhere though and that seems to have been his mother.", "YTA for blaming the wrong person. Your husband is the problem here. He has repeatedly disrespected your wishes and yet you continue to give him a free pass? Why not your MIL then?

That's why I explained that I wasn't mad the first time she asked, but the second time. My Mom would definitely become the queen of sarcasm if they ever dare to ask her. It's a strange thing but in my country, you just cannot ask about bad things (to save face?).", "Maybe confront is not the right choice of word? Just out of curiosity, don't we have things that we want to process first and don't want to talk about it in detail? For example,  you lost a job. You tell your relative but don't want to discuss it yet, and ask to be left alone. Say, your relative is concerned and ask you, but you emphasize that please give you some space first. If they keep asking, wouldn't that be rude? It can be seen as caring, but it does cause damage to the recipient."]}
