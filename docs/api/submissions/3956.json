There is also other settings where you can meet up with his friends and invite them to your home. \n but... It could also be said that the way he went about it (go to mother, go to friends, mentioning how you are being manipulative...) is in itself quite well manipulative... I am not saying he is but the irony is not lost on me. However, this would probably be not just his only justification/example of what he sees as a controlling behaviour on your part I imagine. Could there be something there? In any case, I think you may have bigger problems in your relationship than just your birthday.", "NTA He gets no say on guests when you are doing all the organising and catering on your OWN party.", "NTA, that sounds exhausting.

He wasn't a narcissist in the clinical sense, but definitely self-absorbed and always wanted everything his own way. My moment of truth happened after so many fights where I sobbed and pleaded with him to understand that I was totally miserable. He maintained that he was happy and there was nothing to fix.\n\nAt a certain point I realized he did not care how miserable his behavior was making me. He did not care about my happiness as long as I continued to behave like the \"girlfriend appliance.\" Like your husband, as long as he was good, there was nothing for him to work on.\n\nYour relationship reminds me of my old one. Seems like you're bending yourself in knots to make sure this person isn't upset, making sure you're not taking up too much space.
