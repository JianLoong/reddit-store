There is also other settings where you can meet up with his friends and invite them to your home. \n but... It could also be said that the way he went about it (go to mother, go to friends, mentioning how you are being manipulative...) is in itself quite well manipulative... I am not saying he is but the irony is not lost on me. However, this would probably be not just his only justification/example of what he sees as a controlling behaviour on your part I imagine. Could there be something there?

Don\u2019t trust what he says. \n\nAnd he\u2019s purposefully trying to make you doubt yourself. Trust yourself and your intuition.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. He made your birthday party about himself. He is pretty selfish.", "Are you sure he is not a narcissist?", "Only going to say, if I am given the chance to make an assumption,  and given *your* post history, **AHEM**, I would say there is more going on here than the simple story of a husband's reaction to an innocent 30 year old's birthday party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso why did you organise your own party without him?\n\nBut that's just me and clearly it goes well against the hive mind.", "My dad always said \"never get involved in other people's relationships, even if they ask. Whatever the outcome, you'll get the blame.\"", "Same here. Even when you get along with your parents and inlaws, that's the stuff they don't forget.", "I don't run to complain but I do (with his consent) call my mother to be a person to moderate the conversation. He consents all the time because 75% of the time she \"sides\" with him (he was in the right and I had a bug up my ass.) The only time I don't do that is when I know her personal biases (like she thinks parents should NEVER play video games cause of the time suck, so if I feel he is spending too much time on wow I don't call her) would get in the way of a fair conversation.", "Even with friends I think you need to be careful and thoughtful. I think about group events for example, and how unfair it is to your partner if they're hanging out with your friends unaware that everyone knows every annoying or frustrating thing they've ever done, probably without much nuance or perspective (because no one vents with nuance or perspective). \n\nOn the other hand, you do need to be able to talk to someone about relationship problems, in case things are unhealthy. My therapist says you always need to have one person who knows the whole truth, whether it's your therapist or a trusted friend. But I don't think it should ever be all of your friends.", "Oh i totally agree. That is what I meant by using them as an authority against the spouse.", "These are the two that stand out. And he was ok the day of my party - I guess. Didn\u2019t help much with prep and didn\u2019t interact with me much but he was gracious with our guests which I appreciated.", "I do feel validated for sure and think it\u2019s an important conversation to have with our therapist. Thankfully we have one and we both like her! (Took a few tries. Guess who was pickier over the choice of therapist?)", "He loves to rub it in my face that I\u2019m socially awkward too. Anytime we are fighting and he thinks it\u2019s relevant\u2026", "Or he just lied about talking to anyone to prove his case", "Not sure. Have definitely considered this multiple times and researched it too. I\u2019m pushing him hard to get therapy and although he said he would he didn\u2019t do anything about it. Claims he is happy with how things are and has nothing he wants to work on. Life must be blissful! We do go to couples therapy and I do individual therapy.", "You sound just like my husband \ud83d\ude0a pretty against the grain. I liked this in the beginning of our relationship. And I still do sometimes. But it can be tiresome too. \n\nYes, we have a turbulent history, I won\u2019t deny that. I have nothing else to add to my post though. I am not leaving anything out. There was no blowout fight before, there\u2019s no uncontrollable drinking (didn\u2019t drink at my party at all), there was hardly a mess left behind thanks to my own clean up job beforehand and our mothers\u2019 work during the party and my clean up job afterwards. I know you\u2019re trying hard to find a reason this is my fault, but you\u2019re literally the only one here trying to do that, and I\u2019ve nothing more to say.", "Oh I absolutely agree friends are also someone you have to be careful with. My husband and I have a trusted couple who we both love who will give us both unbiased advice to help us further in our marriage. They both will hold us both accountable for whatever roll we play in whatever is happening. They are friends but they are also marriage and parenting mentors we have great respect them and they have a beautiful marriage and amazing kids. They also have marriage and parenting mentors that they can talk to about anything and gain more perspective.", "Ew, OP. No no no. This man is a bully. You deserve better. Please read [why does he do that?](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf)\n\nAlso, 100 percent NTA.", "Exactly. \"If he spoke\"", "That sounds very valuable", "Hey cool, thanks for the link. I have heard about it before but living in a small town I would raise eyebrows taking that out at our local library\u2026"]}
