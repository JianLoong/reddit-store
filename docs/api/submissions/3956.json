There is also other settings where you can meet up with his friends and invite them to your home. \n but... It could also be said that the way he went about it (go to mother, go to friends, mentioning how you are being manipulative...) is in itself quite well manipulative... I am not saying he is but the irony is not lost on me. However, this would probably be not just his only justification/example of what he sees as a controlling behaviour on your part I imagine. Could there be something there?

In my experience with cars on hire/lease/PCP, there's often a clause that says you are locked in for at least half of the term, but its possible to cancel after you are half way through. There might be a charge involved, but its usually negligible. \n\nThis is another reason to speak to a financial advisor. They could look over the contract and see if there's an \"out\" clause so you could end it early. Don't assume you are locked in to the end of the deal and use that as a reason to suffer needlessly. \n\nNot saying it is definitely the case with your agreement, but its worth looking into.

I can only control myself; I must remind myself this. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not worth staying miserable because of paying too much for vehicles. Silly really.

Not sure that makes a difference.\n\nI was specifically referring to vehicles under finance. It does depend on the type of finance and the agreement as it was signed. But that's why I'd recommend speaking to a financial advisor. You may think you know the obligations you have to fulfil, but you might be surprised at the sort of \"out\" clauses there are.\n\nI couldn't possibly tell you if you've got such clauses, but an expert with access to your paperwork would. Its worth talking to your bank, because there's a good chance you might be able to get a free consultation with an expert and then you could find out whether you really need to wait until June to start your plan to clear debt. If its possible to start that sooner, then every month helps.\n\nAs someone once told me, never assume anything. Get it confirmed by an expert who knows. It could make all the difference."]}
