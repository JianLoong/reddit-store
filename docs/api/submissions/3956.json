He can throw another get together. \n\nWTF is up with so many adults running to their parents when they have a disagreement with their spouse? And then assuming the parents opinions matter. It\u2019s weird, but maybe that\u2019s the society we live in now.", "NTA- it was your party, it was already 60 people for goodness sake AND you offered to meet them on another occasion. As long as your husband has at least a few people present that he knew and liked, you\u2019re fine. \n\nBut his reaction is concerning. Tattling to his parents, holding a grudge and calling you controlling? OP, have you heard of DARVO? Is this behavior isolated or part of a pattern?", "NTA, it\u2019s her birthday party, she should be able to choose who goes. The fact that the husband keeps bringing it up as controlling is quite ironic as it\u2019s controlling of him to try and decides who is invited to her birthday party\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. \n\nAlso he didn\u2019t need to involved parents or \u201cpeople who are qualified in counselling\u201d(notice how he didn\u2019t just say counsellors) on something like this, at the end of the day it was your choice plain and simple.", "Nta and his attitude is off putting", "NTA - You don't generally invite random people the birthday person doesn't know to a birthday party. \n\nAlso if I were invited to a party of someone I didn't know I might think it was a bit of a gift grab - Most people bring presents to birthday parties after all.", "NTA, \nIt\u2019s your birthday and you are the one planning the party so you should get to decide on the guest list, especially if your space is limited! He can host another get together with his friends another time.", "NTA. Your birthday, your guests.", "Beware of the tactic of appealing to authority - saying that he's talked about it with people who are qualified in counseling. It's a fallacy and it's used to manipulate. \n\nThis is your birthday party. There's nothing controlling about not wanting to invite people you don't know to your own birthday. Your husband is putting up some red flags.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He\u2019s allowed to sulk (whine even) but that that. If there\u2019s a bigger picture of him trying to get outside \u201cauthority\u201d on your marriage then you really should discuss when that\u2019s appropriate. No one in counseling who works with couples would give him advice about your nature without meeting you.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a party for your birthday. Sounds like he\u2019s trying to turn it into his party.", "NTA, it's your birthday. If he wants to invite people to a party, he should plan one himself, not impose on yours.", "NTA. And I\u2019d bet that if you spoke with people who are \u201cqualified in counseling\u201d that you\u2019d also hear some eye opening stuff about your husband and his need for control. The tattling thing in itself seems juvenile in nature, but I\u2019m not qualified to say for certain.", "NTA. \n\nCall his bluff. Plan a date night that starts at couples therapy. \n\nDon\u2019t let strangers come to your birthday party. Wtf.", "He\u2019s a knob", "NTA but your husband is the one being controlling and manipulative. It's your party about you, you decide the guest list and it shouldn't include people you don't know if you don't want it. Is your husband always this way?", "NTA Your husband sounds really controlling. \n\nHe  is angry because he didn\u2019t get to dictate the guest list to YOUR birthday party. That\u2019s is nuts. The fact that he\u2019s still whining about it and trying to project his negative actions on you is especially disturbing. Look up DARVO, this is straight out of the abuser\u2019s playbook. He has you questioning reality so his tactics are working\u2026", "NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s your birthday and it\u2019s about how you feel on the day, not him. If he wants to have a get together he can do that separately. Not on a day that he should be making sure attention is on you. \n\nAlso, he\u2019s probably lying about people qualified in counselling. Why wait so long to bring it up instead of using the time to validate his own selfish feelings. He sounds very childish.", "NTA, your wife not letting you invite a few mates to her birthday party hardly requires counselling input. Would love to know what it opened his eyes to, the fact that he is being a brat?", "NTA. He can invite his guest list for his birthday celebration. Not sure what this blustering about people in \"counseling\" is about, but y'all may consider finding healthier ways of resolving conflict together as it clearly is not resolved in his mind.\n\nTo be clear, I do not believe he is correct to assert that you are controlling, but improvement in conflict resolution could help him learn to react more gracefully and express his emotion more appropriately", "NTA in this exact situation because the birthday is about you and presumably he knows your friends and family. There is also other settings where you can meet up with his friends and invite them to your home. \n but... It could also be said that the way he went about it (go to mother, go to friends, mentioning how you are being manipulative...) is in itself quite well manipulative... I am not saying he is but the irony is not lost on me. However, this would probably be not just his only justification/example of what he sees as a controlling behaviour on your part I imagine. Could there be something there? In any case, I think you may have bigger problems in your relationship than just your birthday.", "NTA He gets no say on guests when you are doing all the organising and catering on your OWN party.", "NTA, that sounds exhausting. For your next milestone, schedule the party and he can be surprised.", "Excuse me but I think I misread. He wants to invite people you don't know to your bday party, and you're already making the cupcakes for your own bday....NTA. \n\nHe's selfish, not everything is about him.", "NTA but was anyone else weirded out by the full spelling of 30th. It looks so wrong spelled out I was certain OP misspelled it so I had to check but no it\u2019s thirtieth.", "This is oddly reminiscent of a small child pouting and jealous about another child's birthday and demanding their own play date and party at the same time. The whole running and crying to mommy and everything.\n\nNTA, but whatcha doin' in this thing, OP?", "NTA, but I personally would've said, invite them if you want, but let's hire out the cupcake making and such if he wanted them there. But he shouldn't make it more work for you!", "NAH\n\nEveryone wants to control the birthday party. 2 people but only 1 is getting the final decision... so who\u2019s it gonna be? It\u2019s your party. Do what you want & don\u2019t worry about hubby. Or let him try to help & be included & accept he\u2019s going to invite randoms. What\u2019s the worst that happens? You both have fun. \n\nedit\n\nETA are you the host or the guest of honor at your party? If you\u2019re both, you may want to ask for help. Your husband will engage with his random guests (he\u2019s an adult) you won\u2019t need to spend all your time entertaining them. Shake a hand & move on. It\u2019s your birthday party. No one expects to get your full attention.", "YTA.\n\nWhy does nobody ask about the husband's perspective?\n\n Did he get fair warning of the date and time? Did he know all of your invites? Did he even agree to have the party? Did he have to partake in cleaning and prep? \n\nDid he have to socialise with the people you invited? Did he have to deal with any after-party issues?\n\nWhat's wrong with getting to know new people? Do you not have any interest in your husband' s social life? I'd be like yeah, bring it on! I like meeting my husband's pals.\n\nTo br frank I would be off-put by your controlling attitude too. Throwing yourself a party when you live with your family is one thing, but then not allowing your husband to partake? Yeah, fuck that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom took his side and it caused a rift between us for quite a while. She eventually realized that there were 2 sides and maybe she didn't know everything that was going on.", "My mom looks at things from her own perspective a beat longer than is polite, but she came through and invited me to move back home   \n\nI only discussed one example of our disagreements, because she took it personally (smoking, he and she did, I did not) although my step father saw immediately that the issue was not the smoke but the lack of support (ex's friend blew smoke in my face when I refused to get high, and when I left the room my ex chastised me for being rude to his guest.  I left the pot part out of the story to mom.)\n\nSo big picture, home is where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in, but I am just as happy to be back on my own feet again."]}
