If anyone asks, tell them you keep racists away. If they don't ask then they know why & are enabling the racist.  Can you move a greater distance from these people?", "The moment you mentioned racism was the moment you earned an NTA vote.", "NTA. Your decision is completely justified and reasonable. Urging your husband to go is generous beyond the call of duty.", "NTA\n\nBut your children shouldn't go either. \n\nI would say that you and your children shouldn't attend any gatherings where this racist is invited. And don't ever invite the racist to your home.", "NTA. Also, I wouldn't encourage your husband to go without you and your kids.  It's like saying that you and your kids are the problem.", "NTA. Racism is asshole behavior, no need to put up with that.", "NTA, but what did your husband do when you faced the relative's racist comments?  If he didn't get upset and cause a scene, you have a husband issue.  Have him choose?  He needs to choose you and reject the racist relative.  He should state unequivocally that he will never celebrate anything to do with him unless he apologizes to you and completely stops any racist talk.  Period! Any smack talk says way more about those relatives than anything else.", "NTA. It makes me sad and feels wrong that your husband wants to go. I know you said you're fine with it, but I don't think that's okay. If one of my extended family members was openly racist, I wouldn't go to any event in their honor. Even if one of my extended family members just had a problem with my spouse for no good reason, I wouldn't go to a party in their honor (unless they changed their mind). Kinda seems like the whole family is just quietly accepting this one member's racism. Yuck.", "NTA and I love your husband for standing with all of you in solidarity.", "NTA.  I wouldn't to attend, nor my children.  Kids are much more intuitive than people realize, and don't need to be subjected to feeling uncomfortable.  Maybe have a movie marathon and build inside forts with ice cream. Say you are feeling under the weather (for those who may talk smack), take a pic of kids in pj's in the fort and send to hubby at the get together.  The pic lends credibility to feeling under the weather, you avoid racist hillbilly dude, and your kids enjoy some adventures.", "NTA. Husband can go or stay home. If he goes he tells them you had previous plans for the kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And any family that would talk smack about you not being there needs to talk to their racist family members first.", "NTA and being cool with your husband going and not making him choose is above and beyond. Is there any way, for this gathering anyway, you could make up an excuse not to go to avoid the smack talk? Like, oh she is visiting a Fri that\u2019s only in town this weekend?

That's not on at all", "NTA and honestly your husband shouldn\u2019t be going either unless he\u2019s making a solid effort to point out their racism.

And anyone who asks me to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or \u2018keep the peace\u2019 is complicit in his racism.\u201d\n\nI have an Uncle who ranted on the book of faces that there is nothing wrong with calling it the China Virus. I am East Asian, my husband is a different East Asian and we have two biological kids. When my mother called him out on it and he doubled down, I immediately unfriended him and his whole family. I refused to go to his son\u2019s wedding in FL. I\u2019d say I\u2019ve gone NC but tbh, it\u2019s no different than what we were before except now I have confirmation he\u2019s a POS racist. I\u2019m already mentally prepping for the possibility of seeing him at my sister\u2019s wedding. It\u2019ll be a fine line to walk in standing up for myself and my family, and not ruining my sister\u2019s big day.", "I love that stance!", "White man here, married to a black woman. I am blessed that as far as I know, none of my family are even remotely racist. However, I think if any of them were, and were openly hostile to my wife, I would not attend any family function they were invited to.  In my mind, that is condoning racism and is passive racism. Racism survives because we don't stop it. All it takes for evil to survive is for good people to allow it."]}
