{"id": 6196, "submission_id": "100m54h", "title": "AITA - Monthly Open Forum, January 2023", "selftext": "Happy New Year, and welcome to the monthly open forum! This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialogue with the mod team.\n\n\n#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n___\n\nWith the start of a new year, we\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge someone who has put a ton of time and effort into helping the sub run - our esteemed Botmaster, u/Phteven_J! We briefly touched upon his contributions to the sub in our [5-million member announcement post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/)  but we wanted to give a bit more recognition here.\n\nPhteven is unique among the mod team in that he doesn\u2019t focus on rule enforcement, or reviewing posts/comments. He may drop in from time to time, if the mood to do so strikes, but his contribution to the sub is far greater. When an idea or question about anything to do with Bots is posed, either by users or another mod, Phteven is the one to whom we look. When we experimented with contest mode a few months back, Phteven is the one who made it possible. Judgment Bot actively patrolling the sub to look for, and remove, shitposts was another Phteven touch. Basically, anything that involves a productive bot for this sub is Phteven.\n\nAnd that adds up to a lot! In November alone, Judgment Bot performed over **133,000** actions. That\u2019s more than 133,000 comments filtered, posts flared, or shitposts marked that a human mod didn\u2019t have to trawl through the sub for. By comparison, the closest human mod had over 35,300 actions. If we look at the last year, the number of actions performed by Judgment Bot skyrockets to over 1.8 million. The most a human mod had last year was 211,000 actions.\nTo be fully honest, this sub would not function the way it does without Phteven.\n\nBefore Phteven, this sub was in the dark ages. We had to manually change post flair (which ended up with some gems like \u201ctomato ass motherfucker\u201d), standardized voting acronyms didn\u2019t exist, user flair wasn\u2019t a thing, and we walked uphill both ways in the snow to find modmail. Then Phteven came, and with him came the bots.\n\nSome notes about the man himself:\n\n* Phteven spends a lot of time on his woodworking hobby. You can see his work on his instagram https://www.instagram.com/dogwoodhandcrafts/. Specifically, he makes shaving brushes, cutting boards, and decorative things like eggs or bugs in amber.\n* He has been a computer engineer for 11 years.\n* His wife tells him the strangest thing about him is that he eats fast food on a plate. (I have to admit, this is pretty hilarious!)\n* Phteven\u2019s other hobbies include cigars, spending time with his dogs and cats, playing VR, making woodworking and gameplay videos for youtube, CNC projects, 3D printing, Dungeons and Dragons, making custom dice, target shooting, DDR, BBQing, making his own beef jerky, and he played guitar in what he describes as \u201c...a weird darkwave goth band in college.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see some examples of his craftsmanship, check out a couple of his YouTube videos (with some pretty impressive view counts!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsFGLA_0u_o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz1-y5C5vTw\n\nOne final note, to be clear - Phteven only works on and deploys good bots to help the sub - all the comment-stealing bots out there are programmed by villains that better hope they never run into our Phteven!\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n#**We have begun work on the 2022 Best of and will have a separate stickied post soon!**\nWe wanted to let 2022 actually come to a close before putting anything together. I\u2019ve always found it odd that \u201cBest Of\u2026\u201d stuff comes out before the year is over. Makes it feel like December is left out\u2026\n\n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\nWe always need mods for the US overnight hours. Currently, we could also definitely benefit from mods active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.", "created_utc": 1672587634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100m54h/aita_monthly_open_forum_january_2023/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Thanks for the kind words :) It's been a wild few years and I've enjoyed seeing this place go from 150,000 subs to 5 million. \n\nIf anyone is curious about our bot workflow, I put together a diagram to explain it to the mods of this sub and others.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/P03Hugl\n\nAll of this data makes its way to visual dashboards that allow the mods to monitor the subreddit for anomalies as well as collect statistics and metrics to compare historical data. We are also able to view the status of the bots in case one goes down, which may break the subreddit :)\n\nHere is an example of the dashboards for New Years Day at noon EST (note: the dashboard software is called Grafana - I did not create it):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/p5oE9pp\n\nHere is a summary of the data for December 2022:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eGujqlv\n\nI hope some of you find that interesting. Thanks for making this such a fantastic community!", "I have a question: sometimes I write a comment only to get a message that the comments are closed. This is frustrating because I put thought, effort, and time into formulating those answers. If I knew the comments were closed, I wouldn't bother. I feel my time was wasted. Am I missing something somewhere that tells us the comments are closed, or does that only show up when I try to post a comment?", "If comments are closed there will be a small gold lock on the post. It is in the top right corner on mobile for me.", "Thank you, I will look for that.", "I\u2019m very excited for voting for assholes last year, I was saving posts all year for the nominations", "Just a note- they might not be locked when you start. What I do is refresh the page after reading a long post, to see if it's been removed.", "The post about the aunt who took away her nephew's PS5 gift and cancelled their college fund over Santa Claus is fucking UNHINGED.  Everyone in their saying NTA is unhinged.  That is a completely nuclear reaction to the situation.", "When the entire subreddit is the AH (which is 90% of the time)", "Does the word \u201cfinance\u2019s\u201d added before MIL (or whichever relative) take that long to type?  It\u2019s shorter than \u201cmy MIL (she\u2019s not really my mother yet, but it\u2019s easier to say)\u201d.   I  think I saw at last 6 of these in the last 24 hours. It really annoys me.", "I can understand these in a weird way. My mom remarried when I was 24 (and had been dating the guy since just after I moved out entirely at 18), and I never know how to refer to him. I like the guy, and he's a grandfather to my kids, but he's not really a father figure to me at all so it feels weird to call him step dad. \"My mom's husband\" feels a little odd too, like it isn't quite enough to describe the relationship.\n\nI can totally understand someone engaged struggling with how to refer to their future mother in law if they're already thinking of them as being their mother in law. It's interesting the weight we give titles like that.", "I see what your saying, but I\u2019m getting more of a lazy way of not having to type \u2018finance\u2019s\u201d every time it\u2019s in the post, and explaining in the intro.  Than, I\u2019m not quite comfortable with the term.  But I could be wrong.", "Oh yeah, it could totally be that too! \n\nPeople are weird about providing names and titles for the people in their post too. My favorite is when someone goes \"my husband (who I'll call Brad)...\" and then exclusively referring to them as \"my husband\" throughout the post and never using the name Brad.", "Is this where I complain that 99% of the trash that makes it to r/all is clearly just poorly written fiction? Do you require all posts to be made by brand new accounts, or do they just do it because they know it\u2019s fiction and want it separate from their normal account?", "*there", "People use throwaways because harassment can be an issue.", "Usually that just means the comments were locked while you were reading the post/comments. You have to refresh the page for it to show that it was locked.", "It's not \"finance's\", it's \"fiance's\".", "Is action taken against top commenters that change their vote once they get the top place, but before the bot assigns judgment? I've seen this happening more lately and makes voting pointless.", "I hate when the bullies act like they're the victim in most of these reddit posts. It annoys me so much !!!! \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "[removed]", "Just a thought -- how would we ask WIBTA if it isn't really us, but a relative who is in a particular situation? For instance, (speaking for someone else) WIBTA if I didn't let my daughters attend their father's wedding to the woman for whom he abandoned me and my five daughters? (Sorry for the weird sentence structure.)", "Not a mod, but I think that one is probably gonna be tricky. :/  \n\nSince comments, unlike posts, don't come with an automated copy-paste, it'll be hard to prove if someone editted their comment like that (unless they do what I've seen a few times and leave the original judgement under a strike-through, but then those who do usually have a good reason to change it).\n\nI hope what you describe doesn't become A Thing (more than it appears to already be, according to your experience).", "Question about function: what's considered \"new\" when sorting by new? For the past several weeks/couple of months, sorting by new shows 1 to 3 new(ish) posts, followed by many not at all new posts. Then I sort by \"rising\" and there are more new posts, along with slightly older ones that are picking up steam but that I never saw when sorting by new.", "Hey, you've been busy. I'm curious, is your username based off of someone saying \"My name is Stephen with a ph\" and someone very badly misinterpreting it? (My father is a ph, spelling, and fair warning I'm stealing this joke now.)", "Yes. I stole it from the meme because I\u2019m not creative. I\u2019ve been saying the phrase since I was a baby though.", "They could make edited posts ineligible for final verdict. A bot could check for that. I agree it'd be difficult otherwise. Lately people have been blatant and open in the switch either by directly saying it, or seeing people in replies agree with them but most of them having different verdicts.\n\nI appreciate they may have a good reason for changing it for them, maybe new information came out they influenced their verdict. But by making the edit they are changing the verdict for everyone.", "Ah, I've. Never seen the meme. But cool, hope you have a healthy, happy year!", "Thank you! Just google image search for phteven :) you\u2019ll see a little dog.", "That's very taxing.", ":o Bonus puppy. Thank you!", "Has anyone made a post where they were unanimously the asshole? Did it help shed a light on the situation and cause change? I\u2019m just really curious if a person dubbed the AH would come to terms with it or ignore it and move on", "Has anyone else gotten a weird message from reddit admins saying they are \u201cabusing the report function\u201d and accusing them of doing it to harass other people. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I am being accused of such thing. Yes I\u2019ve reported people for breaking the rules but isn\u2019t that what we are supposed to be doing?", "can we ask if the other person is the asshole instead of us?", "Yeah at this point I\u2019m amazed how much people here will lap up any comically unrealistic garbage written on this stuff especially if it\u2019s something that justifies their preconceived biases (fat/vegan/trans/woman etc. bad)", "Yeah that\u2019s a Reddit-wide bug. New is supposed to show you\u2026 well, new posts in order.", "We would need to keep track of the contents of all of these comments and monitor for changes. It is possible, but a huge undertaking. If the other mods decide it's worth doing, I can try and make it happen.", "it gets a bit less clunky if you just replace the \"me and my five daughters\" with \"us\". \n\nThat said, you could also just ask \"WIBTA for not letting my daughters attend their father's wedding\" (or even just \"a wedding\"), and then put the specific details in the text.", "You don\u2019t. It\u2019s am i the asshole not is so and so the asshole.", "Nope.", "Not allowing edits would skew the judgements if posters withhold important information (that can change the judgement) and only reveal it in comments - in that case, the unedited comments are likely to be those that haven't seen the new information yet.", "Agreed. In those cases you can delete your comment and make a new one rather than unilaterally decide to shift all of the votes to an entirely new verdict. Or just have the bot ignore edited verdicts. It's counterintuitive to the purpose of the subreddit to allow it to happen.", "Then the comments that didn't get around to changing their verdict would likely be top comments, and those that did change it are going to get lost.\n\nThere is no perfect solution to this, unfortunately.", "There should be a \u201cvalid asshole\u201d as an option along with \u201cnobody\u2019s the asshole\u201d", "The latter is NAH and has been a thing for a long time. ;)\n\nUnfortunately it's heavily underused.", "I would say there's no such thing. If you're an asshole, you are an asshole. Even If you feel cool stooping to someone's level, you still took the low road and still have part of the blame.", "Keep it in the post you're complaining about - nobody in the general has enough context to discuss it.", "Happens fairly often. [Filter by Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair%3Aupdate&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=AmItheAsshole&utm_content=t5_2xhvq) and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find some that were originally voted the asshole.", "Technically speaking, you do. But the condition is that there has to be a reasonable possibility that you might be the asshole. if you get judged NTA, the other party involved in the conflict is the asshole.", "Self-indulgent petty rant:\n\nI'm fairly new to the sub and I'm sure everyone goes through this phase and now it's my turn: You don't need to explain why you're using a throwaway account. You don't need to explain that you're using fake names. You probably don't need to explain how you met your fiance.\n\nAnyway, thank you mods for giving us an interesting - if not often frustrating - place to hang out!", "Two days into 2023 and I\u2019m already wishing we left \u201cfucked around and found out\u201d in 2022", "Amen to that!", "Nothing seems real on this section of Reddit. They can't be real, right? Thank you for calling it out. \n\nSide note: I've been noticing these AITA posts popping up very frequently the last week. Is it a reddit algorithm because I visited a few or is the sub being promoted for some reason?", "People have used \"justified asshole\" quite often. But you'd just use the same acronym for bot purposes, so you can't tell the difference. I personally would like to combine NTA and NAH because it answers the sub's fundamental question either way and you're suggestion could be a useful one, too.", "> Side note: I've been noticing these AITA posts popping up very frequently the last week. Is it a reddit algorithm because I visited a few or is the sub being promoted for some reason?\n\nPrior to a few days before Christmas we hadn\u2019t been appearing on /all of being recommended to redditors.  Then we flipped the switch and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing now: just the usual algorithm", "Oh cool thx!"]}
