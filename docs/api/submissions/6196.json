{"id": 6196, "submission_id": "100m54h", "title": "AITA - Monthly Open Forum, January 2023", "selftext": "Happy New Year, and welcome to the monthly open forum! This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialogue with the mod team.\n\n\n#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n___\n\nWith the start of a new year, we\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge someone who has put a ton of time and effort into helping the sub run - our esteemed Botmaster, u/Phteven_J! We briefly touched upon his contributions to the sub in our [5-million member announcement post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/)  but we wanted to give a bit more recognition here.\n\nPhteven is unique among the mod team in that he doesn\u2019t focus on rule enforcement, or reviewing posts/comments. He may drop in from time to time, if the mood to do so strikes, but his contribution to the sub is far greater. When an idea or question about anything to do with Bots is posed, either by users or another mod, Phteven is the one to whom we look. When we experimented with contest mode a few months back, Phteven is the one who made it possible. Judgment Bot actively patrolling the sub to look for, and remove, shitposts was another Phteven touch. Basically, anything that involves a productive bot for this sub is Phteven.\n\nAnd that adds up to a lot! In November alone, Judgment Bot performed over **133,000** actions. That\u2019s more than 133,000 comments filtered, posts flared, or shitposts marked that a human mod didn\u2019t have to trawl through the sub for. By comparison, the closest human mod had over 35,300 actions. If we look at the last year, the number of actions performed by Judgment Bot skyrockets to over 1.8 million. The most a human mod had last year was 211,000 actions.\nTo be fully honest, this sub would not function the way it does without Phteven.\n\nBefore Phteven, this sub was in the dark ages. We had to manually change post flair (which ended up with some gems like \u201ctomato ass motherfucker\u201d), standardized voting acronyms didn\u2019t exist, user flair wasn\u2019t a thing, and we walked uphill both ways in the snow to find modmail. Then Phteven came, and with him came the bots.\n\nSome notes about the man himself:\n\n* Phteven spends a lot of time on his woodworking hobby. You can see his work on his instagram https://www.instagram.com/dogwoodhandcrafts/. Specifically, he makes shaving brushes, cutting boards, and decorative things like eggs or bugs in amber.\n* He has been a computer engineer for 11 years.\n* His wife tells him the strangest thing about him is that he eats fast food on a plate. (I have to admit, this is pretty hilarious!)\n* Phteven\u2019s other hobbies include cigars, spending time with his dogs and cats, playing VR, making woodworking and gameplay videos for youtube, CNC projects, 3D printing, Dungeons and Dragons, making custom dice, target shooting, DDR, BBQing, making his own beef jerky, and he played guitar in what he describes as \u201c...a weird darkwave goth band in college.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see some examples of his craftsmanship, check out a couple of his YouTube videos (with some pretty impressive view counts!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsFGLA_0u_o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz1-y5C5vTw\n\nOne final note, to be clear - Phteven only works on and deploys good bots to help the sub - all the comment-stealing bots out there are programmed by villains that better hope they never run into our Phteven!\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n#**We have begun work on the 2022 Best of and will have a separate stickied post soon!**\nWe wanted to let 2022 actually come to a close before putting anything together. I\u2019ve always found it odd that \u201cBest Of\u2026\u201d stuff comes out before the year is over. Makes it feel like December is left out\u2026\n\n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Thanks for making this such a fantastic community!", "I have a question: sometimes I write a comment only to get a message that the comments are closed. This is frustrating because I put thought, effort, and time into formulating those answers. If I knew the comments were closed, I wouldn't bother. I feel my time was wasted.

My mom remarried when I was 24 (and had been dating the guy since just after I moved out entirely at 18), and I never know how to refer to him. I like the guy, and he's a grandfather to my kids, but he's not really a father figure to me at all so it feels weird to call him step dad. \"My mom's husband\" feels a little odd too, like it isn't quite enough to describe the relationship.\n\nI can totally understand someone engaged struggling with how to refer to their future mother in law if they're already thinking of them as being their mother in law. It's interesting the weight we give titles like that.", "I see what your saying, but I\u2019m getting more of a lazy way of not having to type \u2018finance\u2019s\u201d every time it\u2019s in the post, and explaining in the intro.

(Sorry for the weird sentence structure.)", "Not a mod, but I think that one is probably gonna be tricky. :/  \n\nSince comments, unlike posts, don't come with an automated copy-paste, it'll be hard to prove if someone editted their comment like that (unless they do what I've seen a few times and leave the original judgement under a strike-through, but then those who do usually have a good reason to change it).\n\nI hope what you describe doesn't become A Thing (more than it appears to already be, according to your experience).", "Question about function: what's considered \"new\" when sorting by new?

In those cases you can delete your comment and make a new one rather than unilaterally decide to shift all of the votes to an entirely new verdict. Or just have the bot ignore edited verdicts. It's counterintuitive to the purpose of the subreddit to allow it to happen.", "Then the comments that didn't get around to changing their verdict would likely be top comments, and those that did change it are going to get lost.\n\nThere is no perfect solution to this, unfortunately.", "There should be a \u201cvalid asshole\u201d as an option along with \u201cnobody\u2019s the asshole\u201d", "The latter is NAH and has been a thing for a long time. ;)\n\nUnfortunately it's heavily underused.", "I would say there's no such thing.

It's too often that I see people throwing around words like \"abusive\" or \"abuse\", when really the issue at hand is a miscommunication.

It's a complicated topic.", "For the latter - That is a judgement. NAH - No Assholes Here. It's the opposite of ESH - Everyone Sucks Here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut for your first suggestion - I see the suggestion for \"justified/valid asshole\" a lot and I find it confusing. Would you be able to give more of an explanation, or possibly an example, of what a \"justified asshole\" would be? Because a user's judgement comes down to whether or not the view an action (or actions) as right or wrong - Which parties, any or all, are wrong in a conflict. \"justified wrong\" seems contradictory. Does it mean the action was wrong but understandable? Well, then the action is still wrong and it would be YTA or ESH. Does it mean the circumstances warranted the action and therefore the action was not wrong? Then that seems like it would be NTA or NAH.\n\nPart of my confusion is 'valid asshole' can mean at least two different things here - It could essentially mean 'understandable but still wrong', or it could mean 'action was warranted and not wrong'. If you think someone's action in a conflict was ultimately wrong, being sympathetic or understanding doesn't change that. It starts getting into the \"judging character rather than judging actions\" territory, which is missing the point. Presumably the comment with the judgement would include an explanation that likely indicates the understanding/sympathy, but I don't see why that would need a separate judgement from the existing ones. People can be understandable, sympathetic, good hearted, well intended, etc... and still be wrong. Good hearted, well meaning people are wrong every day! Anyone and everyone is wrong sometimes. \n\nAlternatively, when people use valid to mean 'warranted', AKA - \"given the circumstances, it was not wrong to do/say what you did, even if it might be under most circumstances.\" (A lot of times this would refer to OP giving a snarky retort to someone who's been persistently rude/nosy/insulting/ etc... Some type of clap back, or maybe a passive aggressive action to deal with someone giving them grief). But in that case, if the opinion is that the action itself was not a wrong action, the judgement would fit into NTA or NAH depending on the other party.\n\nMy concern if \"valid asshole\" was an official judgement, is that it would further perpetuate the harmful narrative that \"wrong = bad person, right = good person\". Already there are people who decide since they think OP is a good person, it's not right to call them the asshole and so they dismiss any wrong action as completely fine. Or that if someone is the asshole, they must be a bad person so it's ok to insult them. (As a side note, I also find this to be a growing and hugely problematic mentality in real life. People are too uncomfortable with the possibility of them or someone they respect being wrong because they think it's an insult to their character and so they dismiss the action and ultimately prevent growth). The way I understand \"valid asshole\" is that it becomes a character judgement rather than an action judgement, and that significantly misses the mark.\n\nI think there would be less demand for a valid/justified asshole verdict if collectively we stopped believing and perpetuating the myth that telling someone they were wrong (or informing them of the hurt resulting from their actions) is an insult or an attack.\n\nBut granted, maybe there's a way people mean \"valid/justified\" asshole that I haven't picked up on yet - So I really would be curious to hear an example! It's possible there's an entirely different way someone means valid/justified asshole and I'm basing my thoughts off incorrect assumptions.", "I think the point of this subreddit is some self reflection. If you confirm someone else is an AH then there's no introspection. Also describing someone else's actions invariably leaves out a lot of details.", "Oh I agree 100% that this subreddit has helped people! People wanting to validate their behavior makes up 90% of the posts here.\n\n But I remember reading a post about someone who didn't want their roommate to sleep in their bed and the comments said OP was being \"emotionally abusive\". Post was taken down, so i dont remember details, but I remember agreeing that op was the ah. That being said, calling them emotionally abusive seemed far fetched. \n\nSometimes I agree with the verdict, but I really dislike the mob mentality that accompanies it when it's unjustified.", "I kinda see them as serving two different purposes - NTA being more \"The other person is at fault\" while NAH is \"No one is at fault; these things just happen sometimes.\"", "Oh yeah, you're not wrong! \n\nWhat really gets me is how rarely a distinction is made between \"hey, this sounds *potentially* abusive and you should check out some resources to learn more\" and \"this is definitely abusive\", because there's a massive, massive difference between the impact of those two statements. Same with \"this is similar to what my ex did, and they also did Y and Z, do those sound familiar?\" vs \"Your partner definitely does Y and Z\".", "Yeah, sometimes I feel as if people have never spoken to another human being and forget that you can be AH without being abusive or even toxic.
