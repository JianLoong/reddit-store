This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialogue with the mod team.\n\n\n#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n___\n\nWith the start of a new year, we\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge someone who has put a ton of time and effort into helping the sub run - our esteemed Botmaster, u/Phteven_J! We briefly touched upon his contributions to the sub in our [5-million member announcement post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/)  but we wanted to give a bit more recognition here.\n\nPhteven is unique among the mod team in that he doesn\u2019t focus on rule enforcement, or reviewing posts/comments. He may drop in from time to time, if the mood to do so strikes, but his contribution to the sub is far greater. When an idea or question about anything to do with Bots is posed, either by users or another mod, Phteven is the one to whom we look. When we experimented with contest mode a few months back, Phteven is the one who made it possible. Judgment Bot actively patrolling the sub to look for, and remove, shitposts was another Phteven touch. Basically, anything that involves a productive bot for this sub is Phteven.\n\nAnd that adds up to a lot! In November alone, Judgment Bot performed over **133,000** actions. That\u2019s more than 133,000 comments filtered, posts flared, or shitposts marked that a human mod didn\u2019t have to trawl through the sub for. By comparison, the closest human mod had over 35,300 actions. If we look at the last year, the number of actions performed by Judgment Bot skyrockets to over 1.8 million. The most a human mod had last year was 211,000 actions.\nTo be fully honest, this sub would not function the way it does without Phteven.\n\nBefore Phteven, this sub was in the dark ages. We had to manually change post flair (which ended up with some gems like \u201ctomato ass motherfucker\u201d), standardized voting acronyms didn\u2019t exist, user flair wasn\u2019t a thing, and we walked uphill both ways in the snow to find modmail. Then Phteven came, and with him came the bots.\n\nSome notes about the man himself:\n\n* Phteven spends a lot of time on his woodworking hobby. You can see his work on his instagram https://www.instagram.com/dogwoodhandcrafts/. Specifically, he makes shaving brushes, cutting boards, and decorative things like eggs or bugs in amber.\n* He has been a computer engineer for 11 years.\n* His wife tells him the strangest thing about him is that he eats fast food on a plate. (I have to admit, this is pretty hilarious!)\n* Phteven\u2019s other hobbies include cigars, spending time with his dogs and cats, playing VR, making woodworking and gameplay videos for youtube, CNC projects, 3D printing, Dungeons and Dragons, making custom dice, target shooting, DDR, BBQing, making his own beef jerky, and he played guitar in what he describes as \u201c...a weird darkwave goth band in college.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see some examples of his craftsmanship, check out a couple of his YouTube videos (with some pretty impressive view counts!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsFGLA_0u_o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz1-y5C5vTw\n\nOne final note, to be clear - Phteven only works on and deploys good bots to help the sub - all the comment-stealing bots out there are programmed by villains that better hope they never run into our Phteven!\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n#**We have begun work on the 2022 Best of and will have a separate stickied post soon!**\nWe wanted to let 2022 actually come to a close before putting anything together. I\u2019ve always found it odd that \u201cBest Of\u2026\u201d stuff comes out before the year is over. Makes it feel like December is left out\u2026\n\n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\n#[We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\nWe always need mods for the US overnight hours. Currently, we could also definitely benefit from mods active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.\n\n* You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mood tools are improving and trickling in, but not quite there yet.\n\n* You need to be at least 18.\n\n* You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.", "created_utc": 1672587634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100m54h/aita_monthly_open_forum_january_2023/", "score": 6, "replies": []}
