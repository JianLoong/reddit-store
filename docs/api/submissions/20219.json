The woman's family pays the wedding, was expected to have a dowry ready... they *paid* someone else to take a woman off their hands basically... gross. \n\nOP is NTA for so many reasons. But my brain is just a going on all these comments lol", "I was gonna say, she should just tell sister that she plans to have a similarly extravagant wedding, and expects sister to contribute equally, so why don't they just call it even and not have to have any money exchange hands?", "Thank you\u2026 as someone with bipolar disorder, I hate seeing people diagnose with such little info. Bipolar isn\u2019t even a personality disorder, it\u2019s a mood disorder. OP doesn\u2019t describe a pattern of behavior that indicates bipolar or borderline, except for maybe the impulsive decision to get married after 6 months? People are so quick to think those of us with bipolar or borderline are evil villains. Sounds like the sister is just a spoiled brat.", "THANK YOU.\n\nWe\u2019re not villains for crying out loud.", "You can be concerned, but saying it the way OP did wasn\u2019t genuine concern. It was annoyance that their sister has the audacity to expect the money. It wasn\u2019t said out of love and concern. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me how many people here just willfully ignore any level of nuance to these situations.", "The only people who have this opinion are the people who know that they're just as selfish and entitled as OP's sister. By defending the sister, they're defending their own behavior in an attempt to convince themselves that they're a decent person.", "Agreed. It doesn't matter how long they've been together. My brother and SIL got engaged before being together for a year and married shortly after their one year. But they paid for their own stuff and stayed in their financial lane. OP's sister wants an expensive wedding without any consideration for people's financial situation. That's super selfish.", "The sister shouldn\u2019t be expecting family to pay for ANY wedding, extravagant or not.  Worse case, save your Pennies and get married at city hall.", "I call him my husband, but we're not legally married. We've just been together for 11 years. At this point I think some of our friends and family would literally throw money at us if we told them we wanted to get married \ud83d\ude02 I still wouldn't take it. Or maybe I would, but then use it to cook all their favorite foods and have a nice little party after having a courthouse wedding.", "Or even a very cheap one. There is no obligation whatsoever to fund someone else\u2019s occasion.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s the combination that gives me the biggest pause: a quick engagement and a sudden plan for an extravagant wedding. It suggests the sister\u2019s goal is the wedding rather than the marriage.", "I'm one of those people that married a few months after meeting my husband but we paid for a quick wedding ourselves at the Justice of the Peace using rings we bought at KMart and returned to get our money back to make our apartment rent. That was 44 years ago. Nobody is entitled to their siblings' savings to pay for their own life decisions!", "That last bit is the pertinent bit. Length of engagement or dating doesn\u2019t come into it. \n\nIt\u2019s overly entitled to expect anyone to pay for things you want. OP is NTA but the sister is. I don\u2019t know the acronym for that!", "Lol, a year isn't a short time, depending on your age and if you know what you want.\n\nBut you should 100% pay for your own wedding.", "Exactly. I\u2019ve been happily married for almost 7 years and got engaged after just three months, but we didn\u2019t expect our family to pay for anything. We spent about $1,000 and got married privately then went to a bar with friends to celebrate.", "I lived with my ex for 4 years before we got married. We had a budget of $5000 for both wedding (100 guests, mid 1980s) and Jamaica Honeymoon. Wedding gift money from my grandmother. No reason to go into debt for a \"one day party.\"\n\nDon't give the any money. Period.", "Your mention of that Friends episode has me heated all over again. I will never stop being annoyed that Chandler caved... I hated all the female characters in that episode.\n\nAlso, we actually ended up making money on our wedding. The costs of everything ended up being under $2000 (including the ring) and family gave us more than that in total money amounts, so we ended up making a profit.  I have NEVER regretted a small wedding, but I know many people who I suspect regret their huge, expensive wedding when they aren't so stable financially down the road. If someone can afford a lavish day, great, but it isn't up to the family to fund. OP is NTA...just wise.", "Right. It\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d for the father of the bide to pay for the wedding. So if anything, mom and dad are breaking with \u201ctradition\u201d in order to create disharmony in the family. And then they\u2019re blaming the other daughter for not picking up the slack.", "I\u2019m unsure that OP is married.", "I'm not sure on that. Sometimes doing what you can to direct the disaster is important. By doing this OP has made it very clear, \"I think this is stupid. You were warned. When it bites you, I'm not responsible.\" Sure, sister blew up. That's the bad option. But silence is the worst option, because it will come with years and years of \"This is your fault.\" At least now she can say, \"You should have listened.\" to tend the discussion every time.", "Couldn't agree more!", "Traditionally it's the parents of the bride, I repeat THE PARENTS of the bride that pay for the wedding... pending they are able. There is no tradition of siblings paying as well. However, in modern times its the couple themselves who pay for the thing. If sissy wants an expensive wedding she can damn well save up for it. NTA and keep your money. Let's be honest, they've only been together six months so even odds they end up divorced and OP wasted their money for nothing. So don't bother", "NTA entirely. Additionally, since it was uninvited, don't advise a less expensive wedding because doing so will make her angry. Not your clowns, but her circus.", "My brother and SIL dated and were engaged for like less than a year. They chose to get married at a courthouse and then stayed within their budget to save and have the wedding they wanted after a couple of years. The only thing I got asked to help with was \u201cdo I have to invite Uncle Dave if I don\u2019t like him?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if OP offered but for her sister to just demand is absolutely absurd.", "Huh?", "I\u2019m a professional and concur.", "I am a lawyer. I have my own firm with some friends. One of the lawyers that worked for us a couple of years got engaged 6 months after starting to work for us. A couple of months later, his fianc\u00e9 walked into my office and demanded to know when we were going to give him his \u201cwedding bonus.\u201d In other words, she expected us to give him a bonus to pay for their wedding.", "This is bot stealing from u/KikiMadeCrazy. Report > Spam > Harmful bot.", "Why did you copy someone else's comment word for word?", "Good job [copying a previous comment almost verbatim](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f36e0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_fund_my_sisters/joy5eh7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "I think a lot of people seem to focus more on the wedding than the marriage, sadly.", "NTA. It's not your wedding, and you don't have to pay for other people's festivities. The rules are yours to make.", "I\u2019m about to get engaged after a year and even I will admit it\u2019s a pretty short period of time. (Which is why we intend to be engaged for another year at least.)", "Met my wife online too, but we married after 4 years to make sure we could afford a wedding and a house deposit.\n\nhowever I made certain our wedding date was also our anniversary of when we met. Saves remembering two dates!", "Congrats!! Funny I met my husband online (DeviantArt) on 26th May. We married 17th October and are coming up on 9 years together :)", "In the end Monica saw the light because while Chandler \"caved\" he talked about what they would be giving up making Monica realize that a marriage was what she actually wanted so they went with a less expensive option for their wedding.", " (buying a bigger apartement my future children with my husband)\n\nI took this to mean she has a husband and they are planning on children in the future when they have a larger apartment.", "Which is all the proof you need to know that her sister didn't pay for her wedding.\n\nNTA\n\nDivorce this sister now.", "True, but that doesn't necessarily indicate a personality disorder.  I agree with you that we are by and large just agreeing loudly but I've worked with/ lived with/ dealt with selfish, spoiled people and people with disordered personalities as a medical diagnosis and the two groups (while definitely a Venn diagram) can be quite different.  \n\nI just don't like garden variety wankers being given a justification when people with personality disorders are sometimes genuinely working hard against it.", "Yeah, I think what u/Comfortable-Gold-982 is talking about really fits more into the \"[rocking the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)\" category - this is someone who has learned that they can usually get what they want by making everyone else's life hell until they get it. There MAY be an underlying disorder, but it's not a given. People learn what their life teaches them.\n\nIf it turns out there is disordered thinking, it doesn't change what OP should do, nor can OP do anything about it on the sister's behalf.", "The money would have been wasted even it they stayed together for the next fifty years. No o e, regardless of their financial situation, should be spending that much money on a party", "Okay, but now we all want to know, was Uncle Dave invited?", "Wow so trashy wtf.\n\n\nNTA\n\nPlease divorce your sister she's a bad fit.", "It's all relative. I had multiple long-term relationships throughout my 20s where marriage wasn't discussed, but when I met my wife we were engaged in under a year. We just knew we were each other's \"the one\". 15ish years later and no regrets. Congrats on the upcoming engagement.", "Congratulations, that's awesome! My take on it is that marriages matter, but weddings aren't that important in the long run.", "I always felt like it was sort of ambiguous as for what the final decision was. They looked like they had a fairly ritzy, traditional wedding in later episodes, so I was never sure who really won. Lol", "Well-stated", "Your last point is the one that needs to be more emphasized in the popular culture. By definition, people cannot have a PD without also having an awareness that their overall daily function is somehow impaired.\n\nThat said, having a structure onto which one can hook a loved one's historically frustrating behaviors can be very useful for people in their close orbit.\n\nIts a tricky line to toe, but I think one worth trying.", "He was not, Uncle Dave is a garbage can of a human being so he was left off the guest list.", "Lmao this comment \"please divorce your sister\"", "Oh that\u2019s true for sure. I never talked marriage with an ex of two years, but my girlfriend and I were in love within weeks of dating."]}
