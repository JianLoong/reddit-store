It's like walking into someone's house and seeing a colony of rabid skunks, and when you ask them about it, they say, \"Oh, my roommate Pennywise is teaching them circus tricks. Anyway, do you think I should ask them to keep the noise down after 2 AM?\"", "Respectfully OP \nHe\u2019s taking advantage of ya\u2019ll and he\u2019s trying to guilt trip others by mocking them and making mean jokes about their living conditions. \n\nI advice you to take your time and think clearly about the entire situation, there are reasons why boss and employee relationships are supposed to be strictly professional \n\nBtw if he\u2019s into girls only it so highly inappropriate for him to try stay at their place \n\nYour boss seems to be a freeloader and a pervert \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with him about him crashing at your place and about crossing other boundaries \n\nIf he always wanted to go then why didn\u2019t he?  You should go with your fianc\u00e9 \n\nListen you\u2019re planing to marry that girl, you\u2019re planning to spend the entire life with her, who knows your boss might turn on you in the future but she\u2019s there forever \n\nTake her to the event, consider her feelings \nI\u2019m a female too and I understand her perspective", "But you've known other people with jobs, right? Like say, your parents? Did your dad's boss regularly spend the night? Any other relatives or friends mention their boss crashing at their home? It's super weird and just isn't done, unless you knew each other as friends before. I guess. Anyway yes, YTA.", "Boss should absolutely not be drinking so much that they can't drive at the house of a direct subordinate. The whole situation is just weird.", "A boss that\u2019s regularly sleeping in his employee\u2019s basement is not the kind of boss that will help OP\u2019s \u2018career progression\u2019", "You gotta pay the troll toll, if you wanna get into your boss\u2019s\u2026", "Yeah, it's weird. I keep trying out scenarios, and nothing's working. Like, are they just a two or three person company, and that's why they are inappropriately in each other's off-time? Is the boss recently divorced, having a midlife crisis, or just lonely? Are they soulmates from another lifetime? Does the boss have a crush on him? Is OP bi and the boss has a crush on him? Is OP in the closet and the boss has a crush on him? Is OP a clueless twinkie who thinks he's climbing the corporate ladder by being a boss bro, and the boss has a crush on him?", "When I first read this, I almost asked if his boss was inspired by Robert California, because this boss seems like he\u2019s intentionally messing with his employee\u2019s minds and is a master manipulator", "Honestly, this is a full and sincere response to this situation. I agree \u2661", "I\u2019d be shocked that the boss could really help with career progression if he does this type of stuff.", "Like reverse John Wayne Gacy or summat.", "OP under the patio slabs!", "Return the slab, or suffer my curse", "What an odd tangent.", "Yes, me too", "Mr. Boss, in the basement, with the candlestick.", "I live in the UK so might be different but a lot of companies I have worked with will at least send an employee over to the hospital with flowers and a card that everyone has signed when a long standing employee has a baby even if the boss doesn't go personally, it's much stranger and seen as bad manors to send an employee or for the boss to visit  someone's home unless of emergency.", "I think Micheal would if he could, but ryan despises Michael."]}
