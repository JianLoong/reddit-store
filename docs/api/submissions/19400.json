This is NOT normal, and unfortunately you're in a position where you've let him walk all over you and he won't appreciate it if you cut him off.", "that would be weird as he stays at most people\u2019s houses since he lives far away and some give him equivalent gifts.\n\nhe stays at my house a little more because we get along well and my guest accommodations is better than most. most people don\u2019t have a full finished basement with a bar for him to stay.", "TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!", "i am understanding that now. and because others were allowing him to stay i did not think it was weird.", "He\u2019s had plenty of time to move back.", "My thoughts exactly", "So you take money from the poor and then give a tiny percentage back to only organizations you care about? It doesn't sound like charity is the cornerstone.", "i am paying in hopes to get ahead.\n\ni didn\u2019t think she would be this upset, another user suggest i might give him both tickets so he can take his boss and they can represent the company together.\n\nme and fiancee will still of course make a donation to the charity, but will go out to eat somewhere nice instead.", "yes i will definitely be taking her out somewhere nice to make up for this mess i made :(", "i understand that now, i will have to come up with an excuse on why he can no longer stay so he does not get angry.", "he moved far away during covid and now we are expected to come in 3 days a week", "yes i realized after the words that invited my boss left my mouth it was a stupid thing to do, that\u2019s why i told her this morning, but was hoping she would be more understanding.", "Seconding the rec for askamanager.org", "So he's also drinking your alcohol while staying at your house? Is he at least reimbursing your for the trouble? He's your superior at work, not your friend.", "I find it bazaar that not only you but other employees allow this to happen and let him take advantage of y'all. He's using you all and that's not ok", "That is his problem and you shouldn't be involved in it. \n\nHe is honestly acting out of line for even asking or assuming co-workers would provide that. He is a grown man.\n\nYou are prioritizing your relationship with him over your SO", "That's weird as fuck. Doesn't he earn enough to pay for a motel or smfh?", "He's your boss so he presumably makes more money than you or any of your coworkers do. Can he not afford to just rent an apartment or hotel room closer to work? How is bumming it at his employees' houses even an option here?", "Then he needs to move closer to the office, get rental housing for the week or something else that isn\u2019t the equivalent of \u201chey, I\u2019m in charge of your salary and promotion opportunities, but feel free to say no to me crashing for the night.\u201d \n\nI get that he is not saying that, OP, but that is the perception, and some employees who let him stay may not want to but don\u2019t feel like saying no is the smart move for them.", "I find it bazaar that not only you but other employees allow this to happen and let him take advantage of y'all.

Umm wait, that's different.", "Thought you ought to know..", "r/unexpectedharrypotter", "Look, your girlfriend was a good sport about him staying, even though it's pretty inappropriate to us outsiders reading your post. It seems like she didn't even bat an eye when you mentioned bringing him to an event that you two went to as a date last year. At least not until you basically told her she was an idiot for assuming you would bring her also. \n\nBottom line, she sounds really supportive. More than I would be, frankly. Really think about that. Think about what it means to have a partner who cares about you (and your career) enough to tolerate her SO's boss essentially living in their basement on a semi-permanent basis. A lot of *housemates* wouldn't be okay with that.\n\nAlso, calm down about the \"this is my career\" stuff. Hear me out because I'm not attacking you. You sound like you may be a little green based on the fact that you thought this arrangement was normal. There is usually a power dynamic between boss and direct report but there is also a power dynamic between \"guy crashing on couch in basement\" and \"guy with house in good location\". Your boss has kinda mucked up the standard power dynamic between you guys in the workplace by putting himself in this position with subordinates. You have more power than you think, as it stands, right now. Sometimes being a doormat even when you have the upper hand can actually hurt you, professionally. People realize that you don't know your worth and will use you or take advantage of you and you will get nothing in return. They will find you useful but won't respect you and that can actually hurt your career.\n\nTell your boss that you didn't realize how important the event was to your girlfriend and apologize but be firm that it's important *to you* to make things up to her. The guy is sleeping on your couch, he's gonna have to be okay with it. And also, you don't want to foster a work relationship where your boss gets the impression that his personal relationship with you comes before your SO. That WILL be a nightmare for you professionally even if you and your girlfriend break up.", ">u/MiserableTour1974 Also, how much PTO do you get off? Jeez.

That\u2019s FUBAR, kiddo. YTA for all of this, but your weirdo boss is an even bigger TA than you could dream of being for taking such gross advantage of his employees.

Either break up and solely focus on your career or idk stop letting your boss stay with you and work on healthy boundaries. Your boss is taking advantage of you and his other employees if he doesn\u2019t just stay with you.", "I hope you don't think that a nice dinner will make up for this.", "Just let her go man, you need to do some deep soul searching and either admit you love either your boss or job more than your fianc\u00e9e. Him sleeping over all the time and you prioritizing him so much is not normal at all. YTA.", "I think nothing short of stopping the wholly inappropriate sleepovers with the boss will make it okay with the GF again.", "Look, putting the issue with the ticket aside, all of your comments about your boss are throwing out major red flags. He should not be sleeping at employee\u2019s homes. He should not be chasing employees outside if they left early. This all sounds like a very toxic work environment. How old are your other coworkers? Because you are still very young, and it is very easy for older employers to take advantage of younger employees who don\u2019t yet know what is and isn\u2019t normal behavior in a workplace. If I were you, I would look for a new job because your boss\u2019s behavior is not going to get better and he will continue to cross boundaries. No job is worth that.", "Just tell him the truth.

This is really weird for him to do and you to allow.", "He\u2019s a 48 year old - nearly twice your age. His living arrangements wouldn\u2019t not be your problem.

Then you told her she should be more understanding.\n\nI am not surprised she was mad.

That isn't okay and I would be reporting him to HR.", "WOW, that is so grossly inappropriate for a supervisor to be doing I am genuinely at a loss for words here.\n\nSince this is your first \"real\" job and you are younger then I can understand you not being aware of proper boundaries in the workplace, but your boss is definitely old enough and experienced enough to know that what he is doing is an absolute HR nightmare.\n\nPlease go to HR ASAP and report all of this, because your boss has no business being in charge of a loaf of bread, much less a team of people.\n\nThere is a very distinct difference between developing a good working relationship with your supervisor, and being completely taken advantage of by an overgrown moocher, and it's time you learned that.\n\nBuck up and get your fianc\u00e9e's ticket back, you owe her at least that much - and hope she forgives you for not only allowing a highly toxic grown ass toddler to take over her home, but for making her priority in your life secondary to said overgrown toddler.", "Time to find a new job.
