Yesterday, I asked my husband again if I could buy a pair of jeans and he told me he won't have money until December 15th. I got upset because I really need them and asked him if we could buy them with his next paycheck in a couple of days. He got really angry and started yelling at me how I don't understand that he doesn't have any money. I mentioned how there's always money for him to go out for drinks with his coworkers every week and he lost it.

Why is he going out for drinks every week if money is tight? What kind of housework does he do? Does he do his share of parenting and mental load?", "You said that your money goes towards what the kids need. Well, the kids need their Mom clothed. You buy the jeans with your own money and then when you don't have enough left for something one of the kids needs, you let him know which kid needs what and then, if he's a good dad, he'll take care of that need instead of going to the bar. If he doesn't, then, you obviously have a problem.", "NTA. So let me get this straight, there's money for him to go out with his friends but ALL of your money is going to the kids and family. That not only isn't fair, I'd say it's absolutely suspicious on his end. If y'all have a shared account, open a new one and put 90% of your money into it. If he's still going out then he sure as hell has oney to be able to buy you what you want after being a homemaker and work part time. That is to much to put on one person.", "NTA\n\nBut more importantly what are your plans when a kid needs braces? Or the car needs new brakes? Or any number of unexpected (but common) expenses?  \n\nIf you guys can't even afford a new pair of jeans, your priority should be to build an emergency fund, asap.  Not spending money on bar tabs.", "You got more problems that needing a new pair of jeans.  If $ is tight, why is he going drinking?  Why are you spending your paycheck on \"fun outings for the whole family?\" You need a budget ASAP.  Start by jotting down every single item that you spend $ on (especially small items). This will give you a better idea of what you are spending, what is necessary and what could be cut.  Then talk to your husband about setting aside a proportion of each of your paychecks for necessities and a smaller amount for discretionary.  That way, you both could still have some personal spending $ for his drinking and your jeans while still covering the necessities.", "NTA! You work FT taking care of the kids, cooking, and cleaning. AND you work a PT job on top of that. You need access to the family's money bc YOU are earning it too. You should 100% have money of your own to spend, on jeans or whatever you want.\n\nI don't understand folks saying you don't need a 4th pair of jeans. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE JEANS. This is about OP having to beg her husband for a little bit of cash for whatever she needs. What if she wants drinks with her friends? \n\nAdd up the total cost of the work you're doing at home and tell your husband you need cash for you to spend on whatever. If he says no, this is a HUGE red flag. It's financial abuse for you to be doing all this work and having to beg for a cheap pair of jeans!", "NTA\n\nYour husband is. Clearly he can afford a pair of jeans for you, but he doesn't prioritize that. Which is pretty shitty.", "NTA - quit using your money as the family fun money.  Start allocating a percentage to a savings account for you and you only.  Set another percentage aside for your needs so you don\u2019t have to BEG for personal items for your. The remaining amount can then still be the fun money.\n\nIs your husband setting up a retirement fund for himself and one for you?\n\nYou need to have more or at least some overview of your financial situation.", "NTA but it seems the real problem you have is your husband going out for drinks while you're having financial issues, since getting by with three pairs of jeans for a month is a non issue. You two should figure out your finances openly, for instance *some* of the money you earn can go to the kids and some of it could be just yours to spend for yourself. Having to ask your husband for a piece of clothing is problematic, especially since you're working too, part-time or not.", "NTA but why is it ok for him to go out drinking? You work hard too.", "NTA- when one spouse is the main financial supporter there should be factors as personal expenses. A shared joint account. He\u2019s being controlling and it seems he likes the power from what I read. How HIS money can be spent. When it\u2019s both your money. Take your paycheck and buy yourself pants. Make him pay for the extracurricular stuff instead.", "NTA. He can afford alcohol but not a new pair of jeans? He can afford a vice but not clothes so his wife can be presentable? 3 pairs of jeans are not enough especially with kids who may get them dirty.\n\nJeans are under $15 dollars at many places. He can afford to buy you a pair.", "Nta,\n  The last part is key.  He has money for him.  It's hard when money is tight but asking for jeans is not unreasonable.  \n\nThis is where budgeting is key.  My wife and I have used a budget and it helps a ton.  We both have clear expectations of where the money is going.", "NTA.. funny enaugh.. i am down to 3 trousers myself... I asked my husband to go buy some (2-3) for my birthday next week we just moved so money is tight too.. I do not need brands but hell.. I need some trousers.. he agreed wholeheardly and asked if I want him to take the day off or if we can go in the evening", "NTA, but your husband sure is. If he can afford to go out drinking with his buddies every week, you can afford to buy a single pair of jeans, on sale, no less. \n\nBuy those jeans with your own money, and don't take the family on any outings for a few weeks. Prioritize yourself once in a while, since your husband clearly doesn't. There is no reason for you to accept being treated as \"less\", when you are the one running the entire household in addition to having a job. None.", "NTA stop paying for the weekend activities and use your money for yourself. He needs to quit social drinking. Not sure where you are, but around here bar drinks are overpriced and some places watered down.", "NTA. My verdict was going to be on the Y side of the TA but this is definitely one that needs reading to the end. If it was just a case of no money until the 15th then you'd have to make do and mend with the 3 you have until then, especially as a properly decent pair of jeans can cost quite a bit (which is why I slob about in my primark ones).\n\nBut you're right... he has money to go out for drinks and socialise, if money is that tight then this is an obvious place to cut back, especially as it has been tight for years. Yeah it may be his stress relief, and if he was only ordering water (at least in the UK tap water is free in most places I've been) then that would be fair enough. But I'm going to put my money on it not being water? Alcohol isn't cheap, going by UK economics as its what I know - one pint can cost on average \u00a34 depending where you live. Let's be frugal and say he only has two pints a week - \u00a38 a week, \u00a332 a month. You can get an okay pair of jeans with that and get a decent pair in two months (judging from shops I go into, I know different countries have different economies).\n\nFurther - what is your weekly stress relief as a part time worker and full time mum? What does he do to chip into these expenses with *his* children, does he take the kids and allow you to just unwind with friends with a glass of wine once a week?\n\nThis isn't about a pair of jeans, from the information I've picked up (and I know there could be more missing), it seems like everything is unbalanced in his favour.", "INFO: are we taking closer to Dolce & Gabbana $1200+ jeans, Guess $400 jeans, or $50 Levi's jeans?  Because if it is the first, it is reasonable to wait until December, if it is the second, it depends on your overall financial situation, and if it is the third and you are having trouble paying for that, it is time to look through your husband's spending and your overall finances real close.", "NTA, both of you should apologize it\u2019s not a worthy fight. but also you have 3 pairs of jeans what\u2019s wrong with the others you have?", "NTA\n\nYou work a part time job and a full-time job. It's not like you're asking for the moon. \n\nGranted my favorite jeans are from Old Navy, so I assume that's what you're asking for and not something the Kardashians are hawking this week.", "You got 3 pairs what's the rush for a new one? \n\nHe has different issues prioritizing alcohol when he is not making enough money... Terrible situation to be in.", "You gave three pairs - how many do you need? You can\u2019t do laundry between now and mid-December?", "ESH. I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201creally needing\u201d a fourth pair of good jeans, so you shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset in the first place. But, your husband also shouldn\u2019t be getting as mad as he did in response, especially if he takes some money weekly to have a tiny social life. You guys should both apologize to each other.", "Feels fake as heck.", "NTA, but from all your comments, you are in a financially abusive relationship. He has a life outside of the house, his money is being spent on his delights. Your small amount of money is going toward the children, you are not even properly clothed.\n\nNo you shouldn't apologize, but you do need to realize you're not going to be treated fairly. Your man has been taking advantage of you for a long time", "YTA. You have enough jeans. Also you don\u2019t sound good about money management. You say you pay for extracurricular activities, outings, and buying random things for the kids. Why don\u2019t you save that money and buy jeans with that? If your husband is the main provider then the money is going to bills which in this time have gone up a lot. Also him going out with coworkers isn\u2019t the same as going out with friends.

I was gonna go the other way until you said he goes out. If money is that tight, he shouldnt be wasting it, should be home so you can work a few extra hours to buy what you need. Wearing/washing 3 pairs of jeans for a couple weeks may be rough but not the end of the world. I think its more the point that's getting to you. I think its time for you to do some major soul searching. Is it fair for you to work part time yet still do 100% of the housework. 100%cooking. 100% childcare, 100%laundry 100% of the extra curricular activities, 100% of the needs of the kids, 100%of the shopping, etc just because he works a few more hours than you? He goes to the bar & gets his free time. When was the last time he watched them so you could have free time (& shouldnt free time be divided equally at the least, you are doing FAR more than he is)? This doesnt sound even close to a partnership.", "NTA.

The very very bare minimum should be that you get to spend some of the money you earn on a damn pair of jeans. Yes, even good ones.

He pays for the kids school, doctor's appointments, car payments, insurance, food, etc. I don't have much time away from home but that's really not a problem. I'd rather go out with the family or stay home and relax.", "I cannot stress this out enough. You are ALSO providing. Your work is probably 3x more demanding than his and doesn't even charge a paycheck. Buy the jeans with your money and he has no right to complain it is your money.", "Seriously, like this isn't just about you. This is about your kids as well. Not knowing about the financial situation that is keeping a roof over their heads and food in their bellies is a problem.", "The compromise would be that husband stops blowing money at the bar every week, not that OP sacrifices yet again.", "I don't understand why you were downvoted (except, reddit).  You said NTA.\n\nIt seems you were just pointing out the fact that some of us can't afford mulitple pairs of jeans and were giving pointers on how to make having a few pairs work.  It's an unfortunate reality for some of us.\n\nIt's not an excuse for the husband spending money on booze when $ is so tight, but I don't think that's what you were saying.", "If you bought more expensive jeans they would probably last way longer than 2 pair of cheap jeans.", "I don't know what point you think you're making but\nstill\nit's okay to have more than 3 pairs of JEANS", "Yeah I assume that everyone's situations are different - I do manual labour and depending on the day, I have to wash my jeans as soon as I get home. But from OP's description, it doesn't sound like she's doing anything out of the ordinary that would make her get absolutely filthy and need to wash them every day.", "Please become more involved with the finances. You have a right to know how much things are and when they're being paid.", "Seems like money is tight just for you and your kids, not for him.", "If money is so tight, he shouldn\u2019t be going out that much, period. He can host get togethers, or go to a friend\u2019s. He needs to cut down personal expenses. Please stop making excuses for his selfishness. \n\nYou sacrificed your career potential to support your family. He is NOT more worthy of pocket money because he\u2019s the breadwinner. You also have a full time job-working part time and momming is that. You say you feel selfish for asking for money. Please remember if you weren\u2019t doing what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d have to be paying someone else to. It is a job. He should also be taking over childcare, so you can have your own space to socialize or wind down however you\u2019d like to. You both deserve pocket money and personal time. This is sounding financially abusive.\n\nEdit:NTA", "Big red flag here. Be more involved in finances and you may be surprised by what you find. You have every right to be aware of what he\u2019s doing if he\u2019s restricting YOUR use of money while going out so often with not restrictions himself. So many unhealthy situations are correlated with financially restrictive behaviors.", "It sounds like you've become complacent. The financials also affect you and you need to be aware of them. Just because you are comfortable spending time at home, doesn't mean that should be your only option.", "What did I write that made you think I disagree with this? I said the husband needs to help more.", "Yeah that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all. I think the husband needs to help out more with house stuff like laundry and stop spending money on booze if they\u2019re in a tight spot. OP is clearly overwhelmed & I was trying to have empathy for their situation.", "It\u2019s not an emergency. They need to work out their budget, sure, but it certainly isn\u2019t urgent.", "Yuuuup", "To be fair, we don't know how much he's spending on his outings.", "something doesn't have to be an emergency to be requested. \npeople with limited finances deserve things too\n\nthe husband out drinking isn't an emergency either. \nwhat are you, the ain't shit husband? YTA", "Absolutely more than a pair of jeans, c'mon", "Honestly a pair of jeans at old navy is $30 so if he went without drinks for two weeks then they should have plenty for a pair of jeans.", "Thank you everyone for your answers. I realize there are things that both me and my husband need to do in order to avoid this type of conflict in the future. I agree with everyone who said I need to be more involved in our family's financial situation. I will work on that and also on becoming more financially independent. In the mean time, I'll wait 2 weeks for my next paycheck and buy myself a new pair of jeans.", "NTA. If you have 3 good pairs of jeans, I don\u2019t think a 4th is an essential but alcohol is a waste of money, and your husband is throwing away money every week. \n\nWhen a Fortnite skin has more monetary value than your drink at the bar, you know you\u2019re fucking up.", "You work part time. Buy yourself some jeans on your payday.  If you need additional funds for the children, your husband can provide those.", "NTA you can buy a pair of jeans on sale for the price of a few drinks- he\u2019s being selfish", "A pair of jeans is not asking a lot unless you want an expensive pair. Old Navy is my favorite place to get them for a good price for me. I\u2019m 5\u201910 with curves and have no problem finding what I need reasonably priced. Shorter women have a better selection for less expensive prices. ( No Body Shaming meant.)", "Your husband is the asshole , not you .", "I think this may be financial abuse.  you both should get 50% of any extra money after everything is paid.   you should make a budget with all the family income then what is left over after all the expenses should be split down the middle.", "Damn what's his problem...I'd buy them just to see them on you. But in all seriousness you're NTA. He shouldn't snap at you like that, he isn't going through the situation alone.", "Do you have access to his paystubs, your tax returns, household bills and statements?\n\nIf not, start documenting (quietly), and figure out what your financial situation really looks like.  Take pictures of as much as possible and keep the info safe.  You may have bigger problems than jeans.", "NTA, and the fact that he\u2019s willing to go out to drink instead of buying drinks for home (WAY less expensive), and he won\u2019t buy you new jeans (?!) is really alarming. You need to find out how much he\u2019s spending on alcohol, because my bet is that he\u2019s buying himself at least two new pairs of jeans in alcohol a month. This is ridiculous.", "not to be the contrarian, but can\u2019t you get by easily with two good pairs of jeans for 3 weeks ?", "You both are. You have 3 other pants so wear those pants if you need to wear any.  Or use your money from your part time job.  Or wait until December 15th.  He is a jerk for going out for weekly drinks but not contributing to the kids or your pants.  I suggest you both figure out how to budget together.  Then you both can spend from the budget.", "Going against the grain to say ESH. Here\u2019s why:\n\nHim: he\u2019s not being transparent about your finances which isn\u2019t okay. He makes room in the budget for his needs such as drinking but is not affording you the same courtesy. \n\nYou: if you have 3 other pair of jeans, you don\u2019t need to immediately replace your favorite pair. If money is tight and you have to wait, then you have to wait. You don\u2019t need a new pair of jeans, you want them. Nothing wrong with that so long as the budget is there. You\u2019re also an AH to yourself for not having a better handle on the family finances which could adversely effect you. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about jeans and drinking. This is about the family finances, communication, and making sure you\u2019re both getting your needs met. Y\u2019all need to have some in depth conversations.", "BOTH YTA... both of you knew that money is tight then why he go on drinks with friends... you have 3 jeans left the new one can wait. Use the other 3. \"Fun outing for the whole family on the weekend and buying random things\"\n\n Cut the outings save the money. Bring the kids to the nearby park, dont buy random things that are not important.\n\nOVERSPENDING TO UNIMPORTANT THINGS thats why money is tight.", "ESH-  you have 3 pairs which should be plenty, but if he feels money is so tight he needs to not go out too.", "ESH if you have 3 pairs why do you need another now, I have 2 pairs and I\u2019m completely fine I", "YTA 100%.  Gee, only THREE pair of jeans, how will you manage?  Ever hear of something called needle and thread?  Or a patch?  \n\n\n  \nI give it 12 to 18 months and you'll be asking AITA for wanting alimony for the next 15 years.", "NTA.\n\nSeems like financial abuse. Do double check of your marriage", "Nta..but im thoroughly confused as to why a spouse would have to ask permission to buy a needed article of clothing? Also, as to why you're unclear on the finances? I can understand each of ya'll having your mad money but general household finances? Id be more concerned with the fact that he's so selfish that he can't forego drinks and such for a night or two so that you can get a needed clothing item if funds are THAT tight. If he's not being transparent with the finances, which seems like he isn't since you had to ask for $ for clothing, then what else is he hiding. He sounds like a walking red flag.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t apologize.  Tell him you don\u2019t mind him going out for drinks but really don\u2019t want to have to wear jeans with a hole in the crotch.", "You have 3 other pair, I would think you would be fine until he actually has the money.  I don't know what he's spending on drinks every week, but that's your business.", "ESH, especially your husband \n\nYou because you knew money is right\nYour husband because he verbally abused you by yelling at you. He needs to be the one to apologize first", "NTA: *I mentioned how there's always money for him to go out for drinks with his coworkers every week and he lost it.* So he does have disposable income - which he chooses not to share with his family.", "NTA. Your family should be combining the two incomes and then making a budget out of the total. After accounting for non-optional expenses like rent or mortgage, school supplies, and groceries, hopefully also savings, you can divvy up the remainder for party gifts, clothes, and going-out money.", "Sounds like a financial abuser and perhaps more here. The power dynamics is saying he is doing a lot worse things behind your back.\n\nDo you know who he is out drinking with?\n\nYou need to look into the home finances. Also, get a job, even if it's a work from home job.", "There is a lot going on here. NTA but your marriage has problems.\n\nI am struggling to understand how a 4th pair of jeans is essential, though his refusal hints at financial abuse when paired with blowing up at you when you pointed out the hypocrisy of his spending habits.\n\nMoney is not tight if he can go out for drinks weekly. You are working - why can't you buy your own jeans? Stop spending your money on other things if you know you need something for yourself. Sounds like spending a weekend at home is the cost of a pair of jeans, unless you only buy designer?", "NTA - what kind of jeans are you getting??", "Please get more involved in the finances and try to get transparency where everything flows into. There\u2019s no way your husband can drink every week but you cannot buy yourself jeans.", "She has THREE good pairs of jeans. She doesn't NEED anymore. That being said, he should definitely share fun money if he's going out every week. ESH", "Just reading what she wrote if I was married to her I'd be in a constant state of drunkeness.", "She already owns 3 \"good\" pairs of jeans...which means she has plenty of clothes (even jeans!)", "This 100%\n\nitemize everything you do.  childcare.  cooking. cleaning.  \n\nhell, around here people charge 50 bucks an hour to clean your house.", "Not the point.  Half of the family's discretionary fund is hers.  half the money he spends on drinking is hers to spend on jeans.", "Same here. I was on husband's side until the drinking. Three pairs of jeans is plenty. I do not think I have ever owned more than three pairs of jeans at any point in my almost 40 years. A fourth pair of jeans is luxury, but so is his drinking and his drinking is a more expensive luxury.", "She\u2019s not just a stay at home parent, she works part-time. She said in a comment that she wears jeans to her work and having four pairs allows her extra time between laundry loads.", "Jeans are usually 60 dollars or more where I live. But that is also the cost of one or two nights of drinking. I do not think anyone needs four pairs of jeans but if he can have his luxuries so should OP. Especially since his is more expensive.", "Then it\u2019s time to sit down and tell him you either need to renegotiate your budget or he\u2019s going to lose a hell of a lot more money and free time when you two inevitably get divorced because you\u2019re tired of being treated like a second class citizen. \n\nYou should have some money to spend on yourself. Why are you the only one spending money on your kids extracirriculars? You need to come up with a household budget for the household income. None of this \u2018my money your money\u2019 shit. How much do you both make? How much do you both contribute to the household? How much are bills, you better involve all child expenses. Agree to an amount to save, then after that you each get half of the pot to spend on what you want.", "Oh honey. Red flag alert. You should see yourself more as an equal. Life is short buy those jeans. Treat yourself!", "You already have THREE good pairs of jeans. ESH.", "Pants are essential. Booze is not.", "Basic clothing items \\*are\\* essential.", "Can you use some of the emergency fund since your pants ripped", "Clearly not if he\u2019s telling you you can\u2019t get a needed piece of clothes to replace one that isn\u2019t functional anymore", "Really, stop with the \"he pays for\" and \"I pay for.\" Make a FAMILY budget that works for all of you.", "It's time to be involved in your families budget. I have been a SAHM for over 10 years now & I have access to every account we have. My husband does the budgeting & bill paying because he's better with numbers than I am but I still have the ability to log in & see everything. & if money actually is really tight, try thrifting or buying on marketplace or eBay.", "His budgeting isn't working. Get involved.", "You do have that. Go out with friends and then for the kids, make him pay. He's not entitled to more fun money just because he is the main earner. It's because you're working as a stay at home mother that he can work.", "While I agree with you & think that is how it should be, I don\u2019t know the agreements they have in their marriage. Just going based off the information provided here. Me and my husband have our own individual money and split bills 50/50. I don\u2019t have to ask him if I want to buy something and that would not work for me personally to have to do so. But clearly that\u2019s what OP and their husband have agreed to. \n\nI\u2019m also not a person who just buys extra clothes unless I need them which is why I asked for clarity on what was wrong with the other jeans she had.", "You don\u2019t have everything you need though. You new clothes, and he\u2019s refusing to buy them for you. His ability to go out and drink alcohol is more important to him than meeting your basic needs.", "It's not selfish to want a new pair of jeans after the old ones ripped. Do you think he feels selfish going out to drink? How much money do you think he spends on drinking compared to one pair of jeans?", "Or yogurt art rooms", "Or the oscillating fan.", "It pleases me that I know all these references \ud83d\ude05", "Unfortunately, clothing quality and price no longer match up well. It takes a lot of research to find high-quality (as opposed to just expensive) clothes.", "But more importantly what are your plans when a kid needs braces?

That\u2019s like\u2026 one outing here. >_>", "I mean it depends on what/how much you drink and where you go. If I go to a dive bar $30 is like 2 drinks. But if you go to a sports bar and drink beer, then you can get at least 4 beers."]}
