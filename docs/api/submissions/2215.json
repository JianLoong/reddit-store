Yesterday, I asked my husband again if I could buy a pair of jeans and he told me he won't have money until December 15th. I got upset because I really need them and asked him if we could buy them with his next paycheck in a couple of days. He got really angry and started yelling at me how I don't understand that he doesn't have any money.

Why is he going out for drinks every week if money is tight? What kind of housework does he do? Does he do his share of parenting and mental load?", "You said that your money goes towards what the kids need. Well, the kids need their Mom clothed. You buy the jeans with your own money and then when you don't have enough left for something one of the kids needs, you let him know which kid needs what and then, if he's a good dad, he'll take care of that need instead of going to the bar. If he doesn't, then, you obviously have a problem.", "NTA. So let me get this straight, there's money for him to go out with his friends but ALL of your money is going to the kids and family. That not only isn't fair, I'd say it's absolutely suspicious on his end. If y'all have a shared account, open a new one and put 90% of your money into it. If he's still going out then he sure as hell has oney to be able to buy you what you want after being a homemaker and work part time. That is to much to put on one person.", "NTA\n\nBut more importantly what are your plans when a kid needs braces? Or the car needs new brakes? Or any number of unexpected (but common) expenses?  \n\nIf you guys can't even afford a new pair of jeans, your priority should be to build an emergency fund, asap.  Not spending money on bar tabs.", "You got more problems that needing a new pair of jeans.  If $ is tight, why is he going drinking?  Why are you spending your paycheck on \"fun outings for the whole family?\" You need a budget ASAP.  Start by jotting down every single item that you spend $ on (especially small items). This will give you a better idea of what you are spending, what is necessary and what could be cut.  Then talk to your husband about setting aside a proportion of each of your paychecks for necessities and a smaller amount for discretionary.  That way, you both could still have some personal spending $ for his drinking and your jeans while still covering the necessities.", "NTA! You work FT taking care of the kids, cooking, and cleaning. AND you work a PT job on top of that. You need access to the family's money bc YOU are earning it too. You should 100% have money of your own to spend, on jeans or whatever you want.\n\nI don't understand folks saying you don't need a 4th pair of jeans. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE JEANS. This is about OP having to beg her husband for a little bit of cash for whatever she needs. What if she wants drinks with her friends? \n\nAdd up the total cost of the work you're doing at home and tell your husband you need cash for you to spend on whatever. If he says no, this is a HUGE red flag. It's financial abuse for you to be doing all this work and having to beg for a cheap pair of jeans!", "NTA\n\nYour husband is. Clearly he can afford a pair of jeans for you, but he doesn't prioritize that. Which is pretty shitty.", "NTA - quit using your money as the family fun money.  Start allocating a percentage to a savings account for you and you only.  Set another percentage aside for your needs so you don\u2019t have to BEG for personal items for your. The remaining amount can then still be the fun money.\n\nIs your husband setting up a retirement fund for himself and one for you?\n\nYou need to have more or at least some overview of your financial situation.", "NTA but it seems the real problem you have is your husband going out for drinks while you're having financial issues, since getting by with three pairs of jeans for a month is a non issue. You two should figure out your finances openly, for instance *some* of the money you earn can go to the kids and some of it could be just yours to spend for yourself. Having to ask your husband for a piece of clothing is problematic, especially since you're working too, part-time or not.", "NTA but why is it ok for him to go out drinking? You work hard too.", "NTA- when one spouse is the main financial supporter there should be factors as personal expenses. A shared joint account. He\u2019s being controlling and it seems he likes the power from what I read. How HIS money can be spent. When it\u2019s both your money. Take your paycheck and buy yourself pants. Make him pay for the extracurricular stuff instead.", "NTA. He can afford alcohol but not a new pair of jeans? He can afford a vice but not clothes so his wife can be presentable? 3 pairs of jeans are not enough especially with kids who may get them dirty.\n\nJeans are under $15 dollars at many places. He can afford to buy you a pair.", "Nta,\n  The last part is key.  He has money for him.  It's hard when money is tight but asking for jeans is not unreasonable.  \n\nThis is where budgeting is key.  My wife and I have used a budget and it helps a ton.  We both have clear expectations of where the money is going.", "NTA.. funny enaugh.. i am down to 3 trousers myself... I asked my husband to go buy some (2-3) for my birthday next week we just moved so money is tight too.. I do not need brands but hell.. I need some trousers.. he agreed wholeheardly and asked if I want him to take the day off or if we can go in the evening", "NTA, but your husband sure is. If he can afford to go out drinking with his buddies every week, you can afford to buy a single pair of jeans, on sale, no less. \n\nBuy those jeans with your own money, and don't take the family on any outings for a few weeks. Prioritize yourself once in a while, since your husband clearly doesn't. There is no reason for you to accept being treated as \"less\", when you are the one running the entire household in addition to having a job. None.", "NTA stop paying for the weekend activities and use your money for yourself. He needs to quit social drinking. Not sure where you are, but around here bar drinks are overpriced and some places watered down.", "NTA. My verdict was going to be on the Y side of the TA but this is definitely one that needs reading to the end. If it was just a case of no money until the 15th then you'd have to make do and mend with the 3 you have until then, especially as a properly decent pair of jeans can cost quite a bit (which is why I slob about in my primark ones).\n\nBut you're right... he has money to go out for drinks and socialise, if money is that tight then this is an obvious place to cut back, especially as it has been tight for years. Yeah it may be his stress relief, and if he was only ordering water (at least in the UK tap water is free in most places I've been) then that would be fair enough. But I'm going to put my money on it not being water? Alcohol isn't cheap, going by UK economics as its what I know - one pint can cost on average \u00a34 depending where you live. Let's be frugal and say he only has two pints a week - \u00a38 a week, \u00a332 a month. You can get an okay pair of jeans with that and get a decent pair in two months (judging from shops I go into, I know different countries have different economies).\n\nFurther - what is your weekly stress relief as a part time worker and full time mum? What does he do to chip into these expenses with *his* children, does he take the kids and allow you to just unwind with friends with a glass of wine once a week?\n\nThis isn't about a pair of jeans, from the information I've picked up (and I know there could be more missing), it seems like everything is unbalanced in his favour.", "INFO: are we taking closer to Dolce & Gabbana $1200+ jeans, Guess $400 jeans, or $50 Levi's jeans?  Because if it is the first, it is reasonable to wait until December, if it is the second, it depends on your overall financial situation, and if it is the third and you are having trouble paying for that, it is time to look through your husband's spending and your overall finances real close.", "NTA, both of you should apologize it\u2019s not a worthy fight. but also you have 3 pairs of jeans what\u2019s wrong with the others you have?", "NTA\n\nYou work a part time job and a full-time job. It's not like you're asking for the moon. \n\nGranted my favorite jeans are from Old Navy, so I assume that's what you're asking for and not something the Kardashians are hawking this week.", "You got 3 pairs what's the rush for a new one? \n\nHe has different issues prioritizing alcohol when he is not making enough money... Terrible situation to be in.", "You gave three pairs - how many do you need? You can\u2019t do laundry between now and mid-December?", "ESH. I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201creally needing\u201d a fourth pair of good jeans, so you shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset in the first place. But, your husband also shouldn\u2019t be getting as mad as he did in response, especially if he takes some money weekly to have a tiny social life. You guys should both apologize to each other.", "Feels fake as heck.", "NTA, but from all your comments, you are in a financially abusive relationship. He has a life outside of the house, his money is being spent on his delights. Your small amount of money is going toward the children, you are not even properly clothed.\n\nNo you shouldn't apologize, but you do need to realize you're not going to be treated fairly. Your man has been taking advantage of you for a long time", "YTA. You have enough jeans. Also you don\u2019t sound good about money management. You say you pay for extracurricular activities, outings, and buying random things for the kids. Why don\u2019t you save that money and buy jeans with that? If your husband is the main provider then the money is going to bills which in this time have gone up a lot. Also him going out with coworkers isn\u2019t the same as going out with friends.

I was gonna go the other way until you said he goes out. If money is that tight, he shouldnt be wasting it, should be home so you can work a few extra hours to buy what you need. Wearing/washing 3 pairs of jeans for a couple weeks may be rough but not the end of the world. I think its more the point that's getting to you. I think its time for you to do some major soul searching. Is it fair for you to work part time yet still do 100% of the housework. 100%cooking. 100% childcare, 100%laundry 100% of the extra curricular activities, 100% of the needs of the kids, 100%of the shopping, etc just because he works a few more hours than you? He goes to the bar & gets his free time. When was the last time he watched them so you could have free time (& shouldnt free time be divided equally at the least, you are doing FAR more than he is)? This doesnt sound even close to a partnership.", "NTA.

The very very bare minimum should be that you get to spend some of the money you earn on a damn pair of jeans. Yes, even good ones.

She had a big spending problem before she got married and her husband is very frugal. Her parents got divorced because her dad was able to hide from her mom that they were in massive debt, so she readily accepts that finances are her weakness while finances are her husband's strength.\n\nHer husband the sole provider and she's the SAHM. She gets allowances for groceries, personal stuff, etc. She likes this setup because the structure keeps her from overspending and getting them into debt. I've seen this arrangement help transform her from someone who didn't care at all about the \"big-picture\" finances to someone who is very engaged. \n\nThe arrangement isn't always easy. My BFF has definitely confided in me about some of her financial conflicts. She had to fight her husband hard to buy a new car when their son was born (she was driving a beater at that point and was not up to modern safety standards). She wanted new floors in her house, but her husband insisted on doing the work himself rather than hire pros, so she had to live in a construction zone for months.\n\nThey've gotten a lot better about figuring out what each person is willing to compromise on and how to communicate. Try to sit down and have a conversation with your husband about how there is a mismatched between the current allocation of your budget and what you all need.

Just because your version of self-care is staying home and relaxing doesn't mean you shouldn't get a little spending money to make that experience more special.\n\nIf your husband isn't willing to have that conversation or isn't willing to give you the same amount of money every week as he gives to himself, then your problem isn't finances, but a husband that is taking you for granted.", "Brings me back to my childhood.

A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\" -Sir Terry Pratchett, Men At Arms", "Gotcha.
