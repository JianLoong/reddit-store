Like in mousse?", "We also underestimate the amount of time it takes for eggs to reach supermarket shelves. It could be months before they end up in your fridge.", "I have read that if you store unwashed eggs in salt, like bury them in salt, not touching each other, they can in theory last forever.", "okay, that is truly foul!", "My boss throws away the contents of her fridges and freezers if the power goes out. Even if the food is still cold/frozen by the time the power comes back on. It\u2019s madness.", "No, it\u2019s just that the risk isn\u2019t really that big. It exists, for sure, but if you have a healthy gut biome and and immune system, you can process small amounts of bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses without issue. It\u2019s not like a minute past the recommended timeframe and you\u2019ll die, it\u2019s a combination of factors that determine if, with what, and how bad. \n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that we overdo food safety and the resultant food waste is shameful. Doesn\u2019t mean we should be eating rancid mayo for fun, but that we can use discretion and common sense and it\u2019ll most likely be fine (same as everything else in life, really.)", "Probably. \n\nFrom OPs other comments, eggs are sold unrefrigerated there as well. So I don\u2019t see how this is an issue at all honestly.", "Rinsing an egg off with water doesn\u2019t clean off bacteria. It\u2019s just large particulates. That\u2019s why you cook it, to kill anything that\u2019s in there. Do you think rinsing a piece of raw chicken makes it safe to eat?", "You\u2019re not wrong! For me it was more about getting off what I could see. If I couldn\u2019t see it, I wasn\u2019t grossed out by it.", "Ok, but if someone farts within a foot of my toothbrush, I'm changing it.", "\"Normal\" is clearly relative. That is abnormal/gross in my social circle.", "No wonder you don't wash fresh eggs.", "I dig you. I also don\u2019t close my toilet to flush. Yes, I know, fecal spray\u2026 but I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all a secret, there\u2019s tiny fecal particles on everything regardless. And your body is well adapted to handle it.", "Hey, we think the same. Dont let all the redditors criticise you. I also flush with the toilet open btw, everybody does in my house. And an egg is just from a chicken, it is just nature. Your doing grat", "They absolutely can touch during the cracking process.", "Salt the water when you boil them. The salt breaks down the membrane so fresh eggs are easier to peel.", "I've found pressure cooking them usually gets the shell to release easily, fresh or no. Works for brown and white eggs equally well.", "They are just dense.", "Exactly. So if in the journey supermarket to home you have a situation where you go from cold to warm, you then need to refrigerate the eggs to avoid bacteria proliferation", "It's a bit more complicated than that in the UK.\n\nWhat you're supposed to do in the UK is store eggs in a cool, dry, constant temperature. This can be outside a fridge or inside a fridge, but the temperature must be cool and constant, and the location must be dry.\n\nYou also should not store eggs in the fridge door if you do keep them in a fridge; the door isn't a constant temperature because of the regular opening/closing. As a result, eggs can actually go off faster when stored in a fridge door than if they're stored either outside the fridge or deeper inside the fridge.", "I haven\u2019t looked it up, but is that a particularly realistic risk or is it more theoretical? I collected eggs from my hens during near-freezing temps (and sometimes sub, but freezing solid cracked the eggs) which would be the same effect, and never put them in the fridge. Didn\u2019t think much of it, today is the first I\u2019ve heard of the risks of egg condensation.", "I often do the water test to make sure my eggs are still good past expiration. They typically last a good month past expiration date for me. I'm in the US and buy the refrigerated eggs to keep in my home fridge", "I did have one rotten egg encounter. My grandma kept a painted Easter egg in her closet with the Easter decor (she must have thought it was plastic or something.) It eventually exploded. After that, we always blew out the egg contents before storing them.", "Yes! I thought I knew what \"rotten egg\" smell was until I actually encountered a rotten egg.", "This is why I always crack my eggs into a separate bowl before adding them into something. I've never had a rotten egg but I have had blood spots. This isn't actually bad for you but it's gross so I throw out any eggs that have them.", "I suppose salmonella can breed faster at room temp, so if you were to get contamination, you\u2019d be ingesting more of the bacteria.  \n\nBut I think its primary purpose is so the egg doesn\u2019t literally rot, which it will eventually do at room temp once the cuticle has been removed. (Same principle as meat in the fridge.)", "Haha, no worries, I wfh and I do not hide my disdain for what I consider to be over the top food hygiene!", "Oh I\u2019m sure they do, I\u2019m just not convinced it\u2019s anywhere the timelines we\u2019re told.", "But the eggs from the store are not refrigerated. So they wouldn\u2019t be going from cold to warm.", "why are you assuming that OP refrigerates his eggs on the way home??", "So don't be an idiot?", "But 99% of fridges in UK/Ireland come with an egg holder that is meant to sit in the fridge door.\n\nAlso the cool, dry place normally means the kitchen press.", "https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-happens-if-eggs-sweat\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16865883/\n\nhttps://www.health.vic.gov.au/food-safety/egg-safety-retailers-and-distributors\n\nHere's some different resources about it :)", "More modern fridges have stopped doing that and the egg trays sit further back in the fridges now (I recently had to replace my almost 20 year old refrigerator, which did have egg trays in the door that I never used, so I had a bit of culture shock investigating modern designs lol)."]}
