Unless you're on the clock, you are not required to spend time outside of work with your colleagues, and your boss is an AH for responding the way she did. Honestly, I would consider looking for another job anyway, she's creating a hostile environment and discriminating against you for having family obligations.", "NTA\n\nIf you boss tries bringing it up again, turn the tables on her.  Tell her you are disappointed in her.  That getting s\\*\\*t-faced with kids is not a good look for her.  Make a vague reference to what happened the last time and refuse to elaborate.  It is clear that what she is really disappointed in is that she just lost her babysitter.", "Really, who does this? \n\nThey don\u2019t get to control your private time.\n\nI\u2019ve often attended things so bosses won\u2019t get mad at me.\n\nIf you don\u2019t ask people if they want to go, and promise you won\u2019t be petty if they don\u2019t, then don\u2019t have functions outside of work hours.", "NTA - kind of ridiculous this trip was sprung on you when they know you have a family. I wouldn\u2019t go either. I feel bad you work more than you\u2019re home and your kids don\u2019t get to spend much time with you. Maybe it will affect the job, but that could be a good thing for you and your family and mental health. Your work schedule, stress, family stress, it takes a toll.. hope it all works out for you and if it affects the job, so be it you\u2019ll have no problem in that field since it sounds like you\u2019re a great boss", "NTA! You are under no obligation to go on the trip, especially if you have children you want to look after. What surprises me is how you seem to have been asked to sort out basically everything\u2026 that is completely unfair on you.", "NTA - Personally I HATE when work events flow into my personal life.  I don't blame you one bit.  If they want to pay you for the whole time you are there, then maybe consider it.", "NTA. Yes, you're a manager, but the owner wants to seem like hero, so they suggest this grand plan, but don't want to do any of the work to make it happen. If this is some reward for the staff , which includes you, they should schedule the trip and tend to all of the details.\n\nYou're also under no obligation to go on that trip. It sounds like a PITA and your priorities are for your family.", "This is one of those scenarios where it would actually be difficult for anyone to consider you an asshole. You don\u2019t even need to justify not wanting to go. The company\u2019s not paying you. I think if anyone on staff just flat out said \u201cno thanks\u201d, that\u2019s more than enough to not have to go. Furthermore, who the hell wants to get wasted around their bosses? I think you\u2019re doing them a favour by not going - let them cut loose.", "NTA but personally as someone that\u2019s worked in the industry for 20 years.. you shouldn\u2019t be lending money, buying meals or providing/finding regular transportation for your employees. This is way beyond the scope of your responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nUnless it is in your contact they can't legally force you or sack you over it.", "If you're job is at jeopardy then you're required to be there and they have to pay you.", "NTA and if it is mandatory, then he should be paying you for your time technically/\n\n\nAnyway, giant beach party sounds like a bad recipe and they shouldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\nIs anyone under 21? Huge reason not to do it\n\n\nWho will supply alcohol? What if there is alcohol?\n\n\nWhat happens if someone is drunk at this work function? What is someone drowns? Gets injured? What if they vomit or shit all over the air bnb? \n\n\nWhat if people have sex? What if staff members are accused of sexual assault?\n\n\nThere is a reason why many places will do a single day and not multiple days.

They won't risk losing you I bet and cause all that stress to come upon themselves if you left. Totally inappropriate to expect this of you to attend this when you have a family. I think their alcohol/party proclivities is affecting sound ownership decision making.  Normally, professionally, there would be a social separation between the boss and the employees, its good for respect, performance and behaviour issues. The fact you have to do all of those things for young adult workers, the fact your boss has those expectations in the first place and is suggesting your job is at risk despite all that you do, suggests that respect and social separation is blown out of the water. Something toxic is going on or developing and they have the notion they can walk all over you and that you're a doormat.  Put yourself in a position where you are not desperate for the job, set up options for yourself now so you don't end up worse off.", "NTA.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could take the opportunity to amend the blurt and just rationally explain as you have done above.  That you need to spend more time with your family.  It's a priority.  Leave off any criticism of others.", "NTA- You really should be looking for another job if you can.\n\nGuilt tripping you and threatening your job. If you don't attend, you can tell your boss to let you know if you should apply for unemployment.", "YOU NEED A NEW JOB.  Spend those three days looking for one and not going.  You are a manager of a rest. not a daycare.", "NTA but it\u2019s worth having another conversation with your boss to make clear that you have limited time outside of work and it\u2019s very important to find balance between the two. For you that means nights and weekends with family. Just as you couldn\u2019t knock of work to hang out with your kids whenever you felt like neither can you ignore your kids for work. It\u2019s a balance. Your boundary is your nights and weekends are for yourself and your family.", "NTA. Your reference to \u201cmy company\u201d makes me think you work for a larger chain that would have some sort of HR department. I\u2019m in HR, what what you\u2019ve described is an absolute disaster waiting to happen. Do not go.", "Of course you're NTA\n\nAlso, stop finding them reliable transportation, lending them money, covering their shifts, buying them food, and driving them home.", "NTA  you don't have to justify yourself. \n\nThis sounds awful. I wouldn't go either. I already see my coworkers more than my family.", "NTA\nIs your boss offering to pay for your family's accommodation separate from coworkers? Or does she expect all the employees to bunk together, like a bunch of college kids?\n\nYour boss is a huge AH. She's told you to arrange the trip- that's not your job. She expects you to spend a three day weekend trapped with all of your coworkers, ew. I assume she is not offering to pay you overtime for the 48-72 hours straight she wants you to attend her \"work event.\"\n\nIt sounds like there's a real frat house culture at your workplace. Or that's what your boss wants to cultivate.\n\nYour boss is out of line telling you to do all the work to plan her trip. That has nothing to do with your duties in your hired role.  She is even further out of line expecting an employee to spend their \"days off\" away from home and family, with boss and coworkers, and be glad to do it.\n\nIt might be time to put out feelers for a new job. You don't want to be the only adult in a boundaryless workplace.", "I agree.
