I think you\u2019re doing them a favour by not going - let them cut loose.", "NTA but personally as someone that\u2019s worked in the industry for 20 years.. you shouldn\u2019t be lending money, buying meals or providing/finding regular transportation for your employees.

They won't risk losing you I bet and cause all that stress to come upon themselves if you left. Totally inappropriate to expect this of you to attend this when you have a family. I think their alcohol/party proclivities is affecting sound ownership decision making.  Normally, professionally, there would be a social separation between the boss and the employees, its good for respect, performance and behaviour issues. The fact you have to do all of those things for young adult workers, the fact your boss has those expectations in the first place and is suggesting your job is at risk despite all that you do, suggests that respect and social separation is blown out of the water. Something toxic is going on or developing and they have the notion they can walk all over you and that you're a doormat.  Put yourself in a position where you are not desperate for the job, set up options for yourself now so you don't end up worse off.", "NTA.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could take the opportunity to amend the blurt and just rationally explain as you have done above.

If you don't attend, you can tell your boss to let you know if you should apply for unemployment.", "YOU NEED A NEW JOB.  Spend those three days looking for one and not going.  You are a manager of a rest. not a daycare.", "NTA but it\u2019s worth having another conversation with your boss to make clear that you have limited time outside of work and it\u2019s very important to find balance between the two. For you that means nights and weekends with family. Just as you couldn\u2019t knock of work to hang out with your kids whenever you felt like neither can you ignore your kids for work. It\u2019s a balance. Your boundary is your nights and weekends are for yourself and your family.", "NTA. Your reference to \u201cmy company\u201d makes me think you work for a larger chain that would have some sort of HR department. I\u2019m in HR, what what you\u2019ve described is an absolute disaster waiting to happen. Do not go.", "Of course you're NTA\n\nAlso, stop finding them reliable transportation, lending them money, covering their shifts, buying them food, and driving them home.", "NTA  you don't have to justify yourself. \n\nThis sounds awful. I wouldn't go either. I already see my coworkers more than my family.", "NTA\nIs your boss offering to pay for your family's accommodation separate from coworkers? Or does she expect all the employees to bunk together, like a bunch of college kids?\n\nYour boss is a huge AH. She's told you to arrange the trip- that's not your job. She expects you to spend a three day weekend trapped with all of your coworkers, ew. I assume she is not offering to pay you overtime for the 48-72 hours straight she wants you to attend her \"work event.\"\n\nIt sounds like there's a real frat house culture at your workplace. Or that's what your boss wants to cultivate.\n\nYour boss is out of line telling you to do all the work to plan her trip. That has nothing to do with your duties in your hired role.  She is even further out of line expecting an employee to spend their \"days off\" away from home and family, with boss and coworkers, and be glad to do it.\n\nIt might be time to put out feelers for a new job.

Next time, say one of the kiddos has a recital you can't miss, rather than insulting everyone both above and below you at your job.", "NTA Your boss is a bully, trying to use the \"your job may be affected\" gambit to make you go, when she knows she can't replace you.\n\nI really would start putting feelers out for a better job where you're appreciated. In the meantime, I hope you're putting money aside.", "NTA. But in the middle you correctly refer to them as your staff. The owner has bad boundaries here to expect you to attend when you have a family\n\nAs the GM, absent HR it's appropriate to ask you to organize it only if it's a paid team building event. Since it's on your own time, you're correct not to go but should seek other employment.\n\nYou already know you're the only sober person and there may be repercussions for not going.", "NTA, but OP also needs to stop \" Finding them reliable transportation, lending them money, ~~covering their shifts~~, buying them food, driving them home etc. Those things are FAR beyond the scope of normal job duties, even as the manager.  I was a restaurant manager for 17 years, and never once did I or any of my fellow managers do any of those things. Yes, in bad weather, we stayed late so that the employees could call in to let us know that they got home safely. That was it.  The rest of it is not part of your job, nor was it ours.\n\nWhile the owner's heart \\*may\\* be in the right place by wanting to do this for the staff, it is most likely coming from the position that you will look after her and everyone else.  \n\nIt's time to start looking for another job, because all of these items are unreasonable expectations.", "Not AH at all. How you want to spend your free time is not of their business. Unless you get paid during those days, don't give in. You should start looking for jobs.", "Ya, in the US contracts are rare and employers are generally allowed to fire people for any reason other than discrimination based on a protected category like race, religion, gender, disability, etc.", "NTA You are putting in 70 hrs and doing all the crap work that no one wants to do. There is no way the boss is going to let you go.

NTA \n\nIf you end up booking the trip\nFor them (on paid company time of course) for goodness sake make sure you use a company card/ owners card for the booking and not your own Airbnb account.

But the corp pays for everything. This is your boss reliving his frat days . He does not get to dictate your spending money to subsidize his house party", "NTA Your children comes first. Your boss should understand that.", "NTA  Remind your boss that in the military, the senior officers do not attend the junior officer's parties so that the junior officers can cut loose and have more fun!

You might want to consider finding a job that allows you better work-life balance. I know I'd start to resent my partner if they were rarely present and consistently lending money, rides, etc. to their coworkers. You're essentially raising your coworkers and supporting them emotionally, physically, financially, etc. instead of your own children.
