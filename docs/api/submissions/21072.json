After beginning the wedding planning, I found my dress very quickly and fell in love with it, as it was very simple I planned to adapt it and have a few alterations made. \n\nHowever, fianc\u00e9 was super eager to see my chosen dress. It had not yet been purchased, but I was saving for it. \n\nHe insisted on seeing it, even though I said no. I wanted to keep that part of the wedding traditional (bad luck to see the dress before the wedding). However he insisted if I was changing dress upon arrival it didn\u2019t technically count and that it was only bad luck to see me *wearing* the dress. \n\nI gave in and showed him a picture, he seemed happy at the thought of seeing me in the dress. But I was a little sour and regret showing him the photo. \n\nSkip to now. I found another dress and it now holds a very special place. It\u2019s made to my measurements (pure good luck) and it fits the theme of our wedding perfectly! It\u2019s stunning with black and deep red underlay. The shape is just what I wanted and even balanced the gothic feminine that I crave so badly without being over complicated.\n\nI paid the deposit on the dress yesterday, but haven\u2019t told my partner that I\u2019m changing the dress. \n\nAm I the asshole for keeping this from him?\n\nMy MOH insists I\u2019m not, but I feel bad hiding something from him.

Due to some of the comments I\u2019m seeing, I feel the need to say Fianc\u00e9 is aware I\u2019m wearing black as this is always the plan, and the deep red/black is literally our theme. \n\n2. I am paying for my dress, this is not a shared expense for the wedding.\n\n3. He was previously engaged to a very abusive ex who let him have no control/input to their wedding (which never went ahead) so I think him asking to see the dresses I\u2019m looking at or being involved in the dress choice is just him trying to be involved and feel like he\u2019s part of the process.

Yet I would tell him that you changed your mind, but you don\u2019t want to show him the dress this time, because the tradition is important to you. I think you risk him feeling like you lied to him at the very moment his mouth is supposed to drop to the ground in admiration at the moment he sees you in your dress. Not telling him anything might ruin this moment for the both of you.", "NTA. But playing devil\u2019s advocate, you might want to let him know that you changed dresses and that you are sticking to your guns about him not seeing it. I obviously don\u2019t know how he will react but I\u2019m guessing that he won\u2019t be happy if you show up at the altar in something different. Which shouldn\u2019t matter all but, him demanding that he see your dress beforehand is giving red flags. If he was that insistent on seeing it I can only imagine it would get worse. Best of luck.", "NTA. However, just because you did already show him the first one, you might want to just mention you changed your mind. This time insist that you want it to be a surprise and you're not comfortable showing him the new one. If he can't understand or accept that, then that's a different issue you need to work out.", "NTA but you need to think hard about if you should marry someone you don\u2019t feel comfortable saying no to. Your thoughts and feelings are just as important as his. I would use this as practice for yourself: tell him you changed it, you are NOT going to show him, and you ask him to respect that.", "Question: when is the wedding? Next year or in a couple of weeks?\n\nJust give him a heads up a couple of weeks prior to the wedding that you saw a dress you liked better. And now you're so close to the wedding, you don't want him to see it as you want to see the look on his face when you're walking down the aisle in it.\n\nEnjoy your wedding day and have a great marriage.\n\nNAH", "NTA - it\u2019s your dress, and you didn\u2019t even want to show him the other in the first place. Get the dress YOU want, you\u2019re wearing it, not him!", "NTA for wanting to change dresses, however trying to hide it from him so you can get away with something is an AH. How would you feel if held out things to the last minute so you have no choice but to conform to what he wants? If your relationship is based on manipulation to get your way I\u2019d encourage you to sit down and have a conversation about your relationship before you go any further.\n\nFor the record, the tradition is seeing the bride in the dress before the wedding, not seeing the dress.", "NTA\n\nIf the colours have changed, I would mention it, maybe even say that you're not going with the dress you were looking at. But you're fine to not share the details on what you have chosen. It's fairly standard for the groom not to know what the bride is wearing, he doesn't like that, then he needs to get over himself. You are not asking for anything unusual.", "NTA It's your dress.  People change their mind about their wedding dress all the time. Surprise him if that's what you want to do.  \n\n\nPS after your wedding, can you update with a picture of your dress?  I'm super curious as it sounds beautiful!", "That's really between you and him.  It is traditional to keep the wedding dress a secret, but it's not like against current etiquette to do so.  It can help the groom to match up to you or feel apart of the process, but this seems more of a clash between your and his wants so no one really is an AH in the situation, but he may be a bit sour about it.", "\n\nNo, you are not the asshole for not telling your partner about your dress. Everyone has their own idea of what a traditional wedding should look like, and you are well within your rights to keep certain aspects of it to yourself. He may be a little surprised when he sees you in a different dress, but that doesn't mean you have to tell him about it. Your MOH is right - you do not owe your partner an explanation for changing your dress.", "NTA. But you should consider not marrying him. He crossed a boundary and you feel like you have to lie. That's already not a good start.", "Tell him you've chosen another dress so it doesn't feel like bait and switch.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo his first thought at the start of his new marriage will be: She lied to me. He will ownder why you lied, and he will learn: He then will KNOW he can not trust you.", "NTA , it's your dress, and your decision, especially if it holds some sort of a place in your heart. He shouldn't take an issue with this if it makes you happy. It is traditional to hide wedding dresses anyway, and as long as it doesn't look off or clash with the vibe you and him previously decided, you aren't the asshole. I'm sure you look great.", "Starting your marriage with a lie? Oh that's an excellent idea\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "YTA for not telling him about the change. If him not seeing the dress was so important to you you never should have given in in the first place. Now that you have changed your mind, and a lot of it is because of that reason, you need to explain to him that you regret letting him know because the tradition is so important to you and you have changed dresses. You're going to have quite the hole to dig yourself out of if you surprise him on your wedding day and he thinks you lied to him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So he could tell you if he approves or not? Tell him that no means no.", "Idk if this is bad advice, as I usually say communicate, communicate. I think if I was you I would play dumb. Not say anything. If he makes a comment after the wedding I'd be like, oh yeah I did show you that other dress, huh. And leave it at that.", "NTA\n\nTo address your last point- his previous engagement does not excuse his current actions. He is allowed to have some control over wedding planning, sure. But he\u2019s not allowed to demand to see your gown if you don\u2019t want to show him. You are allowed to keep that private until you\u2019re ready to reveal it. I\u2019m a wedding planner and I can promise that he is not trying to just be involved, because pretty much every groom knows that the dress is the bride\u2019s decision and he gets no input on that whatsoever. He absolutely is trying to exert control.", "Be transparent so there are no surprises\u2026 tell him you\u2019re getting a different dress, and any details (ie., colors) that he *needs* to know. But also explain that per tradition, he won\u2019t see it until you\u2019re coming down the aisle.  No ifs, ands, buts, or negotiations. His demanding to see the first one is controlling and a little odd.", "NTA. But be ready for hind to start bugging you to see the dress.", "It's one thing to not be involved in the planning and another to see the dress.\n\nNTA but I personally would tell him I had found another dress but he needed to respect my decision not to show him it. \n\nNTA", "I think it's a bad idea to switch out the dress without letting him know, as that would be lying to him by omission. I would tell him you chose a different dress and don't want to show it to him.\n\nHowever, I can't help being a little uneasy about the third point you bring up. Does he bring up his ex as a reason for wanting more control in your relationship? Or is this just you extrapolating? Because lots of people have awful exes, but when someone uses their ex as a reason for ignoring your boundaries, it's a red flag.", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting it to be a surprise, and he isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting to see it.", "NTA. He\u2019s TA for making you show him in the first place when you said no multiple times. He should\u2019ve respected your boundaries to begin with. That being said, I\u2019d tell him that you\u2019ve changed dresses and he\u2019s not seeing it until your wedding day. Be firm.", "NTA.  Confused.  I don't tell my spouse everything nor does he tell me everything... because it would bore the crap out of us to have to have to listen to every minutia of each other's lives.\nI definitely don't remember specifically telling him I bought my wedding dress.  We planned our wedding together and the clothing in general was one thing among many on the to do list.  When I completed that task, it was checked off, but there wasn't a big to do about it.\n\nMy point is that, no, you don't need to tell him.  It's your dress.  The only reason you might tell him is if it's some wildly different style that you are worried might offend him (like a lace skirt with pasties sort of thing\ud83d\ude02).", "This is what I\u2019m worried about. But my bf also has a face that tells you things way before his mouth does. I\u2019ve abandoned a few dress ideas because he looked like he\u2019d eaten a lemon wedge\u2026. \n\nThis is something for me and I don\u2019t want him to sour something for me. But it\u2019s hard because I don\u2019t want to upset him, but I also know that if I tell him I change the dress, he\u2019ll just want to see it again and I hate saying no", "Generally I don\u2019t feel comfortable saying no to anyone. Not just him", "This seems awfully manipulative. While his permission is not necessary for the dress change why hide it from him? If you can\u2019t talk to him about something as simple as this and have to play games to get by with it I\u2019d question the marriage before it even begins.", "Not until next year at least - we don\u2019t have a definite date yet, we\u2019re still in early stages of planning", "Well...at wedding it kinda actually is about both of them haha", "We already agreed I\u2019d wear black. This isn\u2019t a new concept for him or anyone else", "Thank you! I\u2019ll have to find a way to upload a picture\u2026 the app is only giving an option to add a link", "I only brought up the 3rd point as I saw a few people going for the \u201che\u2019s being manipulative/controlling\u201d and I know it\u2019s often a go to on Reddit", "You need to learn to say no. You're going to have a lifetime of saying no, compromising, saying yes, and discussing both your boundaries and his.\n\nStart now. Tell him you've changed the dress but won't show it to him. Discuss why. Practice having that conversation now because if you both are unable to do that, it's good to know *before* you get married and still have time to fix it.", "I fucking love saying no. It helps me keep my peace, enforce my boundaries, and not overextend myself when I would rather not do something. If he\u2019s upset, so what. He\u2019s been upset before, right? He knows how to moderate his own feelings, right?", "Here\u2019s the thing- marriage is all about compromise, seeing each other\u2019s sides and at least understanding where they are coming from. You\u2019re seeing his, but he\u2019s not seeing or hearing yours. It sounds like the dress is important to him, and you really don\u2019t want to start out your marriage with a \u201clie\u201d walking down the aisle. That\u2019s\u2026a terrible idea of how to start things. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly fine for him to ask to see the dress, and for you to say no, that\u2019s against your wishes and it\u2019s important to you on your big day. Past relationships or no, he doesn\u2019t get his way just because he has some past trust issues. He\u2019s going into a healthy relationship where you both should have your feelings heard and understood. You don\u2019t want to be nervous on your wedding day about his reaction to the dress and you hiding something from him. Tell him you\u2019ve changed the dress, as is your right, and that you want it to be a secret, and that it\u2019s something he needs to value and prioritize (your feelings on the matter.) But don\u2019t hide it from him. And if you guys can\u2019t see eye to eye, it\u2019s time for some pre-marital couples counseling so that both of you can establish safe, comfortable boundaries and opinions within a functional and happy marriage.", "This is a minor thing and you can't even advocate for your own wants and desires. It's concerning. Do you always just go along with what he wants? You should be in control of yourself and your life.", "Do you prefer to see his lemon sour face now or at the wedding?", "Why manipulative? Her future husband is very curious about the dress. If the wedding is still a year away, he'll ask about the dress for a whole year, while she wants it to be a surprise. This way he'll know before hand that it won't be the dress she showed him, but he won't be so very curious and ask questions for the year to come.", "Not trying to be manipulative. I\u2019m just aware that I am a people pleasure and that I\u2019m not good at implementing the things I want, I guess this is me trying to put my foot down without feeling confrontational\u2026. If that makes any kind of sense?", "So don't tell him for now. He'll be too curious about it and as with the other dress ask you about it untill you show it. Wait untill a couple of weeks before the actual wedding.", "I didn\u2019t say the wedding wasn\u2019t about both of them? The dress should be her pick", "You\u2019re allowed to change your mind. I tried on over a hundred dresses when I was getting married. There were a few that I thought were \u201cthe one,\u201d but guess what? I changed my mind! You can do that too, and you don\u2019t owe your fianc\u00e9 any explanation.", "I get that - just bear in mind that \"He seems manipulative/controlling but it's just because he had an abusive ex\" is a *very* common thing for people to say when they have a controlling partner. If you find yourself thinking or saying this at other times, and not just when you're trying to anticipate people being weird on Reddit, then be careful.", "I am a people pleaser. I\u2019m aware that this is an issue for me and I\u2019m doing my best to fix this in therapy. \n\nIt\u2019s not that he chooses everything, I just tend to focus a lot on what other people choose or say rather than my own feelings. Again, working on it", "I appreciate the concern here (genuinely) I\u2019ve been in abusive relationships before, I\u2019ve been in therapy and still undergoing to keep myself out of them. I know he\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s not projecting. I know this for sure"]}
