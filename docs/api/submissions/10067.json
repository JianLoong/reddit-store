{"id": 10067, "submission_id": "113cqir", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not having my niece be the flower girl at my wedding?", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nA few years ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/igsfll/aita_for_not_having_my_niece_be_the_flower_girl/) here on AITA, about my sister making a fuss about my niece not being the flower girl at my wedding. No one has asked for it, but I wanted to share this update anyway, because you guys really helped out a lot.\n\nSo I took a few peoples advice about having both my niece and my then fianc\u00e9's (now wife's!) cousin being the flower girl without letting my sister know there would be two. The day of the wedding and only my sister and niece showed up, BIL was no where to be seen. My sister was a little surprised about the two flower girls, but then surprised me even more by talking about how having two was such a cute idea. My sister was super sweet all through the reception, and I felt like I had my old sister back, which was so so so nice. We had a chance to talk in a way that we hadn't in years, and we spent a little time going over the whole flower girl thing, and my sister was embarrassed and apologized.\n\nWithout getting too much into things, my sister left my brother a few months after our wedding, and she confided in me that part of her decision came from seeing how differently my wife interacted with me and our family members when compared to her husband. Basically, ex-BIL was not a good person to my sister (an understatement!), and she is so much happier now, she's like she was at the reception - like my old sister who is full of life and caring and sweet and an absolute awesome mom. But the biggest reason why I wanted to share this update was because my sister and I have had a lot of long talks since the wedding and the whole flower girl ordeal. All of it stemmed from my ex-BIL and his AH-ishness. He did plan on causing a scene by not allowing my sister or my niece come to the wedding. Apparently it was like a three hour fight before my sister was able to leave for the ceremony. The biggest surprise came when we had a long talk after her divorce started, me my sister and my wife, and my sister kept asking a lot of questions. Most of them centered around us being women who are bi or attracted to women. The next night my sister came out as bi to the both of us. Three weeks after that, without knowing our sister came out, our younger brother came out to the family as pan.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and their kind words. I have my best friend and sister back. I am so very happily married to the most awesome woman in the world. And I get to go with my best friend, my awesome wife, and our super cool pan brother to Pride this year. Things get better, and its okay to give people you love a chance.", "created_utc": 1676506053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113cqir/update_aita_for_not_having_my_niece_be_the_flower/", "score": 2372, "replies": ["Wow! That's such a good update. I'm so happy for you and your family. It's so cool that you and your wife were such an inspiration to your sister that she knew she deserved to be in a better relationship. You're literally 'relationship goals' lol", "I hope your sister invites you to the next wedding! I wonder if her ex was poisoning her with internalized homophobia or she thought it was better to go along with the narrative if he was that much of a problem to her?", "I\u2019m so glad it was a lovely wedding and that you got your family back. Thanks for updating! You might put your two posts in r/bestofredditorupdates too.", "What a wonderful update!!! Thanks for sharing it with us!", "Having two flower girls was the right way to go.", "Thats still an \"ouch\" area for us, but 100% because of the influence of ex for the no invite. I'll probably be MOH at the next one lol\n\nOn a serious note, from our discussions afterwards, there was a lot of internalized homophobia that developed when she was first questioning. It got worse over time. I think my own coming out actually triggered it to get worse and then she met her now ex and he really did make it exponentially worse because he would feed into those internalized feelings and make her feel worse and worse. And part of her own actions and words were, I'm sure, to play into the narrative that her ex established. It kept the peace at home, behind closed doors, and he got into her head so bad she probably started believing it herself at some point.", "I don't blame you two for it being an ouch area. But at least she was able to get out of that and her relationship. I wish you two the best of luck!", "Thank you for the update.\n\nCongrats on getting married (a bit late but fuck it)\n\nCongrats on getting your sister back.\n\nCongrats to your sister for leaving that AH and being able to be her true self.\n\nCongrats to your brother too.\n\nHappy birthday, happy pride, happy easter, merry christmas, happy New year.\n\nPretty sure i got all of it.\n\n>Things get better, and its okay to give people you love a chance.\n\nAbsolutely and THANK GOD your sister was able to realize it too.", "LOVE this update. So wholesome and lovely. Congrats on your new/old sister!", "*\"The next night my sister came out as bi to the both of us.

Happy for u", "Wholesome af. So happy for you! :D", "What an awesome update .. so glad you shared. I hope your sister finds a partner who loves her right.

You stuck by your sister even though she didn't come to your wedding.", "Although wait 7 days, as per the rules there, or it'll get deleted!", "[deleted]", "Oof! Your poor sister! I have heard statistics about bi women experiencing a pretty high chance of domestic abuse. \nI am glad you have been able to reconnect with your family in such a beautiful way! I wish the best for your sister's journey.", "This ending is absolutely heartwarming and life affirming! Congratulations to both of you (you and your sister!)!", "This is a very wholesome and welcome turn of events.  I\u2019m so glad your sister was able to come to her senses and ditch the trash.

I\u2019m glad everything worked out, and that your sister and brother got to come out!! congratulations to everyone!!", "Aw, this made me smile. As someone who's bisexual, I've heard so many stories over the years about how comphet means a lot of bisexuals don't really realise who they are until well into adulthood. I'm so glad your sister has realised who she is, and I hope she'll be a lot happier for it! \n\nCongratulations to all of you.", "Thank you so much for this update. I read your original post and as a bi woman in a committed relationship with another woman who's family is generally awful and homophobic, it really resonated with me. You've given me hope that they do have capacity for change.\n\n\nCongratulations on your awesome life, and enjoy Pride with all your loved ones!", "Great update. And good that your sister escaped.", "Brilliant update!! Warmed the cockles of my little bi heart.

I\u2019m so glad you got to reconcile with your sister, sorry she had to go through all that to finally get here. \n\nI\u2019m older, so I know a lot of bisexuals in straight marriages that have simply never come out to family or more distant friends, and that\u2019s totally okay if that\u2019s where they feel safe - as long as their partners are not promoting hate! \n\nI\u2019m glad your sister realized what real love looks like and got out of that unloving marriage.", "There\u2019s that saying \u201clead by example\u201d. Sister saw all the things wrong with her relationship and her husbands treatment  and came to a sobering realization.", "Wholesome update", "And Happy St Paddy's day (which is in 4 weeks)", "I see you didn't wait a minute to post the same comment twice. :P", "This is accurate. Bi women experience the highest level statistically. Then Lesbians. Then straights. Then gays.", "Oh no!

So glad everything worked out for everyone", "Wow, that is awesome!  It always makes me happy when there's a really positive resolution to these things (I mean, not for BIL but screw him, he sounds like an AH).  So glad your sister is back to her old self and even learning a lot about herself from you and your wife :D   This is like the best possible outcome :D", "I'm really glad things worked out for you OP and that you and your sister reconnected! Congratulations by the way and I wish you, your wife and your family all the very best for the future! X", "I\u2019m crying OP- this is so beautiful. I\u2019m so happy for you and your wife and your sister. \n\nI\u2019m so happy you have your sister back and has freed herself from her AH ex husband who definitely sounds awful. \n\nHappiest Pride to you and your siblings!!! Big hugs if you like them!", "Sending all the hugs. I think people have an amazing capacity to change - they don't always, but they have it. I don't know your situation with your family, but I am assuming you love them like I loved my sister when she was going through her \"homophobic phase\" (which we joke about it being now!). I got a lot of advice to cut her off or to not invite her at all, and I appreciated that because I knew they were looking out for me, but I knew that somewhere deep down my sister was still the same person she was when she had been my best friend. It took years for her to get out of the toxic pit she had been in. But she got out. I like to think she would have even without me around, but some days I think she wouldn't have - if I cut her off, it would have fed into the lies of her ex and the lies her own brain was telling her. I hope your family are able to see through the lies of hate and fear someday as well. Wishing you and your gal pal (\ud83d\ude09) all the best and thank you so much!"]}
