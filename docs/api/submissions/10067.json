No one has asked for it, but I wanted to share this update anyway, because you guys really helped out a lot.\n\nSo I took a few peoples advice about having both my niece and my then fianc\u00e9's (now wife's!) cousin being the flower girl without letting my sister know there would be two. The day of the wedding and only my sister and niece showed up, BIL was no where to be seen. My sister was a little surprised about the two flower girls, but then surprised me even more by talking about how having two was such a cute idea. My sister was super sweet all through the reception, and I felt like I had my old sister back, which was so so so nice. We had a chance to talk in a way that we hadn't in years, and we spent a little time going over the whole flower girl thing, and my sister was embarrassed and apologized.\n\nWithout getting too much into things, my sister left my brother a few months after our wedding, and she confided in me that part of her decision came from seeing how differently my wife interacted with me and our family members when compared to her husband. Basically, ex-BIL was not a good person to my sister (an understatement!), and she is so much happier now, she's like she was at the reception - like my old sister who is full of life and caring and sweet and an absolute awesome mom. But the biggest reason why I wanted to share this update was because my sister and I have had a lot of long talks since the wedding and the whole flower girl ordeal. All of it stemmed from my ex-BIL and his AH-ishness. He did plan on causing a scene by not allowing my sister or my niece come to the wedding. Apparently it was like a three hour fight before my sister was able to leave for the ceremony. The biggest surprise came when we had a long talk after her divorce started, me my sister and my wife, and my sister kept asking a lot of questions. Most of them centered around us being women who are bi or attracted to women. The next night my sister came out as bi to the both of us. Three weeks after that, without knowing our sister came out, our younger brother came out to the family as pan.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and their kind words. I have my best friend and sister back. I am so very happily married to the most awesome woman in the world. And I get to go with my best friend, my awesome wife, and our super cool pan brother to Pride this year. Things get better, and its okay to give people you love a chance.", "created_utc": 1676506053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113cqir/update_aita_for_not_having_my_niece_be_the_flower/", "score": 1652, "replies": ["Wow! That's such a good update. I'm so happy for you and your family. It's so cool that you and your wife were such an inspiration to your sister that she knew she deserved to be in a better relationship. You're literally 'relationship goals' lol", "I hope your sister invites you to the next wedding! I wonder if her ex was poisoning her with internalized homophobia or she thought it was better to go along with the narrative if he was that much of a problem to her?", "I\u2019m so glad it was a lovely wedding and that you got your family back. Thanks for updating! You might put your two posts in r/bestofredditorupdates too.", "What a wonderful update!!! Thanks for sharing it with us!", "Having two flower girls was the right way to go.", "Thats still an \"ouch\" area for us, but 100% because of the influence of ex for the no invite. I'll probably be MOH at the next one lol\n\nOn a serious note, from our discussions afterwards, there was a lot of internalized homophobia that developed when she was first questioning. It got worse over time. I think my own coming out actually triggered it to get worse and then she met her now ex and he really did make it exponentially worse because he would feed into those internalized feelings and make her feel worse and worse. And part of her own actions and words were, I'm sure, to play into the narrative that her ex established. It kept the peace at home, behind closed doors, and he got into her head so bad she probably started believing it herself at some point.", "I don't blame you two for it being an ouch area. But at least she was able to get out of that and her relationship. I wish you two the best of luck!", "Thank you for the update.\n\nCongrats on getting married (a bit late but fuck it)\n\nCongrats on getting your sister back.\n\nCongrats to your sister for leaving that AH and being able to be her true self.\n\nCongrats to your brother too.\n\nHappy birthday, happy pride, happy easter, merry christmas, happy New year.\n\nPretty sure i got all of it.\n\n>Things get better, and its okay to give people you love a chance.\n\nAbsolutely and THANK GOD your sister was able to realize it too.", "LOVE this update. So wholesome and lovely. Congrats on your new/old sister!", "*\"The next night my sister came out as bi to the both of us.

Happy for u", "Wholesome af. So happy for you! :D", "What an awesome update .. so glad you shared. I hope your sister finds a partner who loves her right.

Your poor sister! I have heard statistics about bi women experiencing a pretty high chance of domestic abuse. \nI am glad you have been able to reconnect with your family in such a beautiful way!

I\u2019m glad everything worked out, and that your sister and brother got to come out!! congratulations to everyone!!", "Aw, this made me smile. As someone who's bisexual, I've heard so many stories over the years about how comphet means a lot of bisexuals don't really realise who they are until well into adulthood. I'm so glad your sister has realised who she is, and I hope she'll be a lot happier for it! \n\nCongratulations to all of you.", "Thank you so much for this update. I read your original post and as a bi woman in a committed relationship with another woman who's family is generally awful and homophobic, it really resonated with me. You've given me hope that they do have capacity for change.\n\n\nCongratulations on your awesome life, and enjoy Pride with all your loved ones!", "Great update. And good that your sister escaped."]}
