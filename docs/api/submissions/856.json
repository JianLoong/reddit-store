She's the light of my life and we both adore her. Now I work a long job that eats up a lot of my time. This often causes missed weekends or long evenings where my husband is looking after her.\n\nWhile I'm gone my husband sometimes has friends around for some company. This is fine by me as long as they don't do anything that would hinder his ability to care for our child however, beginning around our daughters fourth birthday there has been one friend in particular who always seems to be around. For the sake of clarity I'll refer to her as Jen. Jen is a single woman who doesn't have kids, she works with my husband and they have been friends for a few years. I have no issue with this and strongly believe a man and woman can be friends but my concerns do lie elsewhere. \n\nOn several occasions I have come home to find Jen and my daughter cuddling together on the sofa watching tv, movies etc. At first I thought nothing of it but now it's become constant. Jen started arriving on my days off to spend time with us, made jokes about being my daughter's nanny and referred to me as an absent mother. \n\nI was appalled, I immediately told her to leave and explained she was no longer welcome in our home or with our child. My husband is annoyed that I kicked her out , calling me selfish and that I was doing it out of guilt that she was right about what she said. \n\nIt hurt to not have him see my side. I'm not speaking to him right now due to these comments and I stand by my ban of Jen from our home but his reaction has made me feel unreasonable.\n\nEDIT:\nThanks for all the advice; I really appreciate all your responses.\n\nInfo: \nJust wanted to come here and clarify a few things based on what I've been seeing said. \n\nFirstly I haven't always been so work focused, before I had my daughter both me and my husband worked similar hours  for similar money. However, when we started trying for a baby we decided we would need to improve our financial situation. I was the more qualified in our relationship so I was the one who moved careers. Upon having our daughter it was clear that while we could afford childcare it would make more sense for my husband to move to part time while I remained the primary source of income. I've been working on reducing my hours but due to my husband's reluctance to move to full time it's been difficult.\n\nMy marriage has always been very important to me and seeing so many people suggest that he may be cheating breaks my heart. The entire situation has brought a lot of strain to our relationship and I feel like it's entirely my own doing, I appreciate the concern but I could never imagine him doing anything to harm our family. Him not supporting me on the Jen issue is a first and was quite shocking and out of character; I plan on speaking to him about it as soon as he gets home tonight.\n\nMy ban on Jen comes after many small remarks and actions that have made me uncomfortable but after reading through your advice I realize now that I didn't take my daughter into account. I will also be contacting Jen to try and work out a way for us to move forward with her instead of banning her completely. \n\nThanks again.", "created_utc": 1667349177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjqf90/aita_for_banning_my_husbands_friend_from_seeing/", "score": 2323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless of Jen\u2019s relationship with your kid or your husband, she should have NEVER made that comment even if that\u2019s how she feels.

It makes me feel like he\u2019s made those comments about you to Jen. Or Jen has said it to him so many times he\u2019s starting to see her point. I think you need to talk to your husband.", "NTA. Her comments were appalling and cruel. But it sounds like you need to have a conversation with your husband. It sounds like he's built up some resentment about how much you are away for work and may feel like effectively a single parent.", "NTA\n\nAlso this reddit tends to jump to conclusions of infidelity, but c'mon, you've laid out some very compelling reasons to be suspicious of your husband and his \"single friend\"", "NTA.\n\nBut I think Jen is trying on the role of step mother. :-/", "NTA. Sounds like Jen is trying to take your spot.", "It seems like Jen is trying to become more than just friends with your husband. Her comments were aimed not only to degrade you as a mother, but also as a wife. She has been slowly trying to corrode your relationship from the inside out based on how your husband chose to support her over you.\n\nWhile I agree that people of the opposite sex absolutely can foster close friendships, friends don\u2019t say those kind of things about someone\u2019s spouse. Your spouse should have put his foot down when she said that. NTA", "NTA. if another woman was cuddling my baby that would be enough to set me off. calling u an absent mother? in your home? if your husband isn\u2019t on your side it\u2019s time to find a new husband", "NTA but the fact that your husband can\u2019t see it then he\u2019s the A H!

She is definitely overstepping and rubbed it in your face.", "Yo your husband, who you help provide for, agreed with Jen???? You needa set that fool straight, and continue to not let your daughter get attached to this homewrecker. NTA", "NTA for banning Jen, but you should use this as a wake up call to be more present for your family. Your husband\u2019s reaction doesn\u2019t mean Jen was in the right for her actions.  However, it does show that he feels you have been absent.  If you prioritize work over your family I can guarantee you will regret it later on. Use this as an opportunity to have an honest conversation with your husband and figure out a way to spend more time with your family.", "I'm gonna go with Nta, even though it was extreme and you could have handled it better, what she said was not ok even if it was a joke, and your husband reaction even if it was in the moment was just as bad if worse, because regardless if it was a joke or not he shouldn't allow his friends to say stuff like that to his wife especially since it upset you, and him saying that sh#t afterwards instead of calming down and talking to you like a adult, because I would be upset at you but I would be even more upset that one of my friend's said that to my partner who is in fact helping to provide for are family, not just sit there a like dumba$$ like he did and let her say that to you, you and him need to talk and get to the bottom of this situation.", "NTA, of course what she said was beyond the pale... but, forgive me, it does feel like your furious reaction must be tinged with a bit of guilt. Clearly, at least, your husband has some resentment built up over the issue. Perhaps focus on that for now, and see how you both feel about Jen as a result.", "NTA\n\nHer feeling comfortable enough to say this and your husband readily agreeing would mean to me that they have been talking about this. This is a concern he should bring up with you and not something that is her place to say, especially in that manner. Him allowing this sort of closeness without talking to you or trying to see your side would also be a red flag to me. \n\nI would look further into why your husband is taking more her side and worries more about her feelings than yours as well. Not saying they are having anything physical, but a certain emotional closeness can develop and maybe turn to something too close. Calm down, take a deep breath and then delve further into what\u2019s happening there.", "This is kind of hard to pass judgment on honestly. \nINFO: How does your daughter feel about Jen?", "YMBTA (You might be the asshole)\n\nI 100% agree that was a dumb and shitty thing to say, but look, you've got someone who it sounds like is serving more as an aunt (the actual word is [alloparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting)) to your daughter while you are away. That's important to your kid's development, she needs a whole circle of adults like that in her life, not just her mom and dad.\n\nMy kids have had several family friends that we refer to as \"aunts\" and \"uncles\", because that's the role they serve in their lives, and with people spread out all over these days, we all need that extended family unit wherever we can get it.\n\nYou state that you firmly believe men and women can be friends but you seem to resent the time Jen spends with your daughter and partner, and your _behavior_ definitely makes it appear as if you see her as a rival -- the sudden ban and escalation really seems like a zero to 100 move on your part, as another commenter said.\n\nI have always said, once you have kids, it's time to stop _being_ a kid, you have to be the adult in the room and put your own ego or insecurities behind you and take the high road. \n\nJen said something hurtful and owes you an apology but it sounds like she has a positive relationship with your daughter, and the right thing to do as a parent is to mend fences with her, move on from this and let her know she's welcome in your home (while also setting and stating healthy boundaries).", "Esh.

This is also sexist as hell as no other man would DARE to impose on another mans family this way and call him an absent dad because he worked hard to pay the bills. It would never be acceptable for YOU to have another man in your home calling himself a third parent and cuddling up on your couch. Your husband would feel disrespected as hell at the VIOLATION of his family.

Even worse she's framing it as if you're choosing to not be there, although you're working, all in front of your child and husband and HES AGREEING WITH HER  This is absurdly gross.\n\nYou need to really consider what this whole situation is telling you about your partner and what he thinks of you. Both of you should talk when you're  both calm. You need to discuss boundaries and ask what/how he feels and why, if you're not looking to end things. You also need to consider what this is going to be doing to your daughters mental health.\n\nYou could come to an agreement with your partner, but if you're not there to stop it and he lets her continue it's going to be really bad.

Oh he can fuck all the way off to a second and third job. \n\nNTA.", "A *very* gentle ESH (in Jen's case, solely due to the absent mother comment). I'm going to offer a potential explanation that would make Jen's behaviour (aside from that comment) inoffensive; I'm not saying it's actually what's happening here, just that Jen and your husband having an affair or moving towards an affair isn't the *only* possibility. \n\nAbout 8 years ago, two dear friends of mine had a baby. I loved this kid so much. She was the nearest thing I've ever had to a child of my own. I babysat her regularly for the first year of her life. Unfortunately, shortly before her first birthday, her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and passed away about a year later. \n\nI'm still in intermittent contact with her husband (who was also a very close friend in his own right at that time of my life, and our diminished friendship is purely a result of international moves - we still e-mail about once a year, but we very much have our own lives). I would never in a million years have betrayed my friend - but I did find myself very tempted at one point to try to start a relationship with her husband after her passing, *purely to keep that child in my life*. I decided against it because no matter how great he is, he deserves someone who wants him for his own sake, not as a means to access a child. \n\nJen absolutely *might be* trying to seduce your husband. She also *should not have* called you an absentee mother. However, I can see a scenario where she got to know your daughter via your husband, came to value and treasure her immensely, felt uncomfortable about taking on a role in her life, and made an awkward and unhelpful joke that went down very badly. \n\nYour husband sucks for not understanding that *even if this was a completely innocent situation*, you are fully entitled to be upset about that comment. I would suggest reaching out to Jen in a conciliatory fashion and explaining why that comment was absolutely not okay, and asking her what had led her to make it. You may still feel uncomfortable having Jen take on such a large role in your daughter's life, but you might also find it within yourself to let her be \"Auntie Jen\", and to make a place for her in the village that's raising your daughter - as long as you are all 100% clear that her place is *not* your place!", "Obviously Jen and your husband have discussed your role in your daughters life, which is COMPLETELY inappropriate. Your husband should not be discussing family matters with anyone, let alone his single female colleague. \n\nIf they haven\u2019t slept together yet, it\u2019s on the radar. You made the right move but I\u2019d evaluate whether you and your husband could benefit from couples counseling. \n\nThis is a HUGE red flag that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.", "ESH.  What she said was rude, but it was also true.  \n\nYou are gone a lot and not able to be there with your kid.  Because of this the childcare falls on your husband and he has his friend there to help him.  \n\nIf you dont want to work less and help with the kid, but you also dont want anyone else to help with the kid, then you are just making your husband do all the childcare with no support.", "ESH. You can\u2019t dedicate your life to working long hours and expect to have a serious relationship, let alone a family. He should leave before trying to replace you.", "If hubs thinks you're so \"absent\" then HE can get another job where he is gone a lot and you can cut hours and stay home. Let him see what you're doing, which is PROVIDING for his ungrateful ass. \n\nOr ASK him, does he want you to work less? Maybe take some time off and pinch money for bills and let's see what he says. \n\nAnd Jen is no longer allowed on days off. She's sus as hell. What a disgusting thing to do and say.", "So, a woman who doesn't have children loves your child. Oh my goodness, she also calls herself as nanny. Did you call the police? She deserves the highest punishment anticipated by the laws. I don't believe in capital punishment but maybe life in prison would bring justice. This will teach her. You must be the only female figure your daughter loves. Anyone saying otherwise is AH. And you are an angel who comes the earth to bring joy and happiness.", "YTA. This will probably get downvoted, but you're TA for working so much. Don't like another woman giving your kid affection? Be at home more! YTA.", "NTA... But I'd be having a serious conversation with my husband about his so called friendship with his coworker. For him to allow her to speak about you in front of your daughter in your own home like that, there's something going on that you're not aware of. You might want to try popping home early from work without letting anyone know.", "Men and women can be platonic friends. \n\n (don't crucify me) It seems like childless people who want children often times invade situations like this and attempt to involve themselves to where they become a pseudo parent/partner.\n\nGet a ring camera and a few more in the house.

Is your husband stupid? No. So he needs to recognize that Jen is very comfortable throwing his wife under the bus, and it has nothing to do with your daughter and a lot more to do with the role she wants to fulfill for him.\n\nShe wants to show you up. She\u2019s coming around all the time. He\u2019s being foolish. \n\nIntentions matter but so do optics. He needs to wake up and see what this looks like.", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s perfect reasonable to believe that a woman cuddling with my family while I am working it\u2019s not an acceptable friendship. \n\nNta, but don\u2019t let them fool you, this friendship it\u2019s extremely inappropriate, and I would not accept that", "NTA. OP your husband may not be willing to stray and views Jen as just a friend; but that doesn\u2019t matter because it seems Jen wants more than a platonic relationship. It\u2019s okay to limit or completely restrict her access to your child because of her comment. Your husband is the bigger problem because 1. he\u2019s clueless to Jen\u2019s overstepping boundaries and 2. Because he\u2019s sticking up for his friend and not his wife.\n\nETA. My husband\u2019s best friend is a gorgeous woman - still turning heads at 45. I completely trust them which is why I believe you when you said say you believe they are just friends.", "NTA If she was actually offering support and trying to help with your long hours, etc, she would have made more of an effort with the mother of this child and she would not have come out of pocket with those comments. This doesn\u2019t seem innocent and she was very disrespectful.", "NTA. You should ask your husband if he has made comments of that nature to Jen. I bet he probably is harbouring some resentment towards you about your work. If he doesn\u2019t see that what you are doing is for your families benefit then he\u2019s an ungrateful and immature person tbh.", "Nta she is absolutely out of line and your husband should have had your back 100%, but i do gotta ask tho\n\nIs he right ? Were you offended because she was basically acting like she was your child's mother (which is DISGUSTING) or because you felt there was some truth in what she said ?\n\nDoesnt matter anyway, that woman ***** and needs to never come back, i just hope your baby wont see it as an abandonment.", "NTA.\n\nNot to overreact, but it's time to start reaching out to a lawyer. Your husband and Jen are absolutely trying to push you out, and the comments about how \"if your mom really loved you, she'd be here\" are going to poison your daughter against you.", "NTA. \n\nAre you SURE their relationship is strictly platonic, though? This sounds really fishy to me.", "NTA and Jen needs not to with your husband outside of work", "NTA you should be more concerned about your husband", "You're right to be upset OP.

She's trying to take over your place as your daughter's mother. NTA", "Nta - but seems that Jen may be preparing to be Step Mom. You and hubby need to have a further conversation.", "Nta", "NTA but your husband is definitely having an affair and is setting it up to show he\u2019s the more stable environment when he leaves you for his mistress.", "I had a job like this and hated myself for it. Worst thing ever was accidentally breaking a promise to my daughter I'd be attending a morning event with her and other parents and their kids for a sports day thing. Left her absolutely bawling cause I had to make an early morning call with our overseas office in Philippines. I don't even remember what the fucking meeting was for anymore. Just how upset my baby was. I am working from home now and even making more bank and don't miss things for my girl anymore.\n\nNTA, OP, but from someone who's been there, it's not worth it. My family is paramount in my life. I wouldn't have it any other way. And if my partner was bringing someone into my home saying and doing things like that, I'd be seriously concerned about other areas of the partner role she was fulfilling. I believe in mixed gender friendship. Hell I can't talk I can barely identify with a gender so this guys vs girls not being able to be friends is weird af to me. But this doesn't pass the smell test.", "NTA, but\u2026 you need to find a job where you can be present in your child\u2019s life for a decent amount of time.

Let me tell you this. Sometimes when a woman is attracted to your husband. The first thing they do is go after the kids, cause it'll make the man see the woman in a different light. Like oh she gets along with my kids so well and seems like a perfect \"mother.\" All I can say is, she definitely has ill intention and that's something you should be watching out for.

Follow your intuition!!", "Im so tired of y\u2019all thinking men and woman friendship can be simple and straightforward with no effort. Y\u2019all can lie to yourself but the fact is proximity is a strong force to leading to other issues.

She insulted your capability as a mother while often showing up - I'm assuming without your express knowledge or permission - when you're not around? There's something seriously not right with this and any bond that Jen may have with your daughter doesn't overrule the disrespect she directed at you. There's something seriously not right with your husband not defending you here. \n\nIf your husband can't firmly assure that there is no affair going on, including an emotional affair, then maybe he deserves a glimpse of what life without the very comfortable cushion you provide him would look like. Is Jen, to him, worth losing the luxury of you being the primary financial provider of the household? Worth losing a stable home and family for your daughter? Is his friendship with Jen so meaningful to him that he expects you to tolerate any disrespect Jen sends your way? \n\nYour husband and Jen are gaping wide AHs. I'm sorry that you've been manipulated for so long.

It was very difficult to get him back to work until I basically forced him back when our kid was 10.   \n\nI missed a lot of school events and memories I\u2019ll never get.

Worry about her and your husband. And to say you are never there ?? Tell him you would be home more if he would work more.", "You can't imagine him not doing anything to harm your family? What about his reluctance to work full time? I'm saying this as someone who was in the same position where I had the better job/better pay so my husband took on a lot of the childcare responsibility. He wasn't doing a good job (playing on his phone, they watched tv all day) and so I wanted them in daycare. He still didn't get a job. Finally, after repeatedly speaking with him about how difficult it was for me to be the sole earner for 4 people and begging for his financial help, going to couple's therapy, and going through a separation with the clause of, when you start working, we can begin to work through this again, I finally had to divorce him. It took him an additional 2 years before he went back to work.

When you\u2019re talking to your husband, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not happening, because you assume he knows the context. \n\nThe problem with that is, different people connect thoughts and interactions differently, and you may be linking things that your husband is not. You\u2019re thinking \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not able to be more present with my family is because my husband is hesitant to resume full-time work,\u201d while he may be thinking \u201cI made the sacrifice of hindering my career advancement to be the primary caregiver to our child, and now that I\u2019ve found a routine I\u2019m happy with and a friend who offers support, my wife wants me to go back to full time.\u201d Or, he could be thinking something else entirely! But because you\u2019re each assuming the other knows that context, neither of you understands the other.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a time to seek validation from strangers on Reddit; it\u2019s time to sit down and have some open communication, ideally with a therapist. A huge benefit of couple\u2019s therapy is that in the process of explaining to the therapist what\u2019s causing tension for your marriage, you\u2019re also hearing one another\u2019s perspectives and how they\u2019re interpreting all that context.\n\nYour husband\u2019s friend definitely overstepped in the things she said to you; but my guess is she\u2019s giving voice to some frustrations your husband shared with her. It\u2019s still inappropriate, but it also could signal a deeper issue than a judgmental friend. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the people who are jumping to infidelity; she may just love kids, he may just value having an adult around to share real conversation. If you believe you can trust him, then don\u2019t let strangers who\u2019ve never met him plant doubts just because he spends time with her. And if she *is* just a friend, then acting suspicious or accusatory about her will make him feel like you\u2019re trying to isolate him from a significant support source. I\u2019ve always had more friendships with people of the opposite gender, sometimes hanging out every day; what makes something romantic isn\u2019t number of hours spent together, but the interactions that occur during that time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, don\u2019t make her a scapegoat for what\u2019s really going on. You and your husband are probably both feeling a bit neglected and used; she may have acted as a microphone, but she\u2019s getting her perspective from what he\u2019s told her.", "Your husband needs to move to full time work.

If you are uncomfortable with things she has said and how she relates to your daughter- TRUST YOUR GUT. \n\nIf you do want to maintain a relationship with her and let her have a relationship with your kid- draw some boundaries. Talk to your husband about communicating with you, about what you\u2019re comfortable with in terms of bonding/cuddling, and let her know that any future time with your daughter will be ended if she continues to make shitty comments about you to your daughter or your husband. Maybe everything is above board and she\u2019s good for your kid- but she needs to understand and honor appropriate boundaries. Those things aren\u2019t funny jokes. They signal disrespect and a disregard for your role as Mama.", "NTA.\n\nDon't bother trying to work out anything with Jen.

Affair or not, he is making choices that harm his family. \n\nHe\u2019s allowing a woman who is not his child\u2019s mother to take on a motherly role to her, he is allowing and defending her when she disrespects OP, and he allows her to come over on OP\u2019s days off, meaning they get no family time. \n\nAffair or not, he is acting in a way that blatantly disrespects his wife, their marriage, and role as their daughters true and only mom. I\u2019d like to see him squirm if OP offered to cut back on her work hours to be home more. I wonder if he\u2019d sing a different tune.", "Honestly imo she also has a husband problem. Husband can have mother or even sister help out why in the world is a work friend so involved. You can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s nothing going on here. Op has been way too passive about this for too long. I worked with children before deciding to be a sahm so I know how important those first 5 years are fit a child. My heart does break for her can\u2019t imagine being in her position theyd both be catching these hands", "It\u2019s exactly the time. She needs a wake up call if she wants to be an active parent.", "It's sounding like a bad (redundant, I know lol) Lifetime movie, isn't it?", "Exactly. Especially your edit.", "I'm great friends with an old co-worker. We still game together online when schedules match up and I reach out when I need help with shit. We send each others kids gifts. His wife had one issue was us saying \"Miss you\" (old joke from work). She brought it up that it made her feel uncomfortable and we both stopped.", "Exactly. Men and women can be friends, great friends! But great friends don\u2019t disrespect your SO or act like more-than-friends. They don\u2019t start acting like they\u2019re replacing your SO, whether that\u2019s with you or with your kid.", "Same and I have a hard rule to my bf that he can complain about me to anyone BUT women friends (his bff's wife who's basically a SIL not included). OP's husband already broke that rule and probably behind her back to the woman friend about her being an absent mother :/", "You have to change how you speak to your friends in case their SO misconstrues your texts, that\u2019s wild. If she can\u2019t handle my being friends with her BF that\u2019s a her problem. Her insecurities aren\u2019t my responsibility. I have many male friends. I speak to them the same way I speak to my female friends.", "What story is this?", "Nope\n\nYou were the one judging someone without all the facts and making assumptions, just as you are doing here.\n\nPeople are allowed to disagree with you.\n\nI offered up some plausible hypotheticals to counter.\n\nOP's post was about the inappropriateness of this other woman's behaviour and you chose to make it about her working too much and turned it into a lecture on her parenting whilst engaging in some mom-shaming.\n\nI guess we both have rich fantasy lives then, because neither one of us knows the inner working dynamics of this family and yet assumptions are being made on both sides.\n\nEdit: I could be wrong, but then again so could you.\n\nNeither knows why she has to work so much or what their situation is.", "We don't know who WANTS to help out, bonds best with baby girl and gets along fine with Dad and the way he parents. My MIL and FIL were the best childcare my children EVER had and they're not biologically related to my oldest two children. \n\nI understand why OP resents the bond her child has with Jen but her little girl is very young and has spent 1/3 of her life so far bonding with this woman who dotes on and nurtures her. It's a very tough spot for OP but any parent who works more than they spent quality time with their family runs the risk that their children and partner will become very dependent on and close to the person providing childcare.", "Ew mother or sister help out. Sexist much eh?", "Haha you\u2019re right tho. Like I\u2019m reading this and thinking, \u201cIs this another shitpost or is OP just really oblivious to what\u2019s happening?\u201d Affair or not, in what world is she the AH when the husband agreed with his friend who called her an absent mom, when she\u2019s working to help support their family? Like they make her sound like a dead beat. This will quickly turn into parental alienation if him and Jen start bad mouthing OP to their daughter. Husband is seriously crossing some lines here.", "Was the joke that you didn't really miss each other?   Since you worked together all day long?  (obviously when you were coworkers, not now...)", "I don't have it, but it's just good common sense unless she's friends with both of you, because then you have her best interest at heart too", "That's ... not better.", "You must be lucky, my friends SO are now wonderful and friends of mine; but they made some really really questionable choices in the past and I learned.\n\nCan you believe I once had one of them beg me for my Facebook pass because his then girlfriend wanted to make sure he deleted a message before I saw it?\n\nI'm curious though, would you tell your friends SO the first time you saw them, that they are not a good mother? Even if you thought so.", "I love how some people need to believe everyone is as shallow and immature as they are, they\u2019re just not admitting it!", "I don't have the link, but if you Google 'Iranian yoghurt reddit' it comes up in all its glory as the top result", "Please? I keep seeing references to an art room that are flying over my head.", "Yeah but it\u2019s not the case where husband has an emergency and needs someone to help out. He\u2019s at home just having this friend over quite often just for the sake of having her over.  It\u2019s completely inappropriate imo especially since it doesn\u2019t seem he runs it by his wife first. I kept deffo would not be having a male friend playing house with me while my husband was out working his ads off to provide for us and you\nBet my husband would not be having no woman playing mum to my child. It\u2019s basic respect. There\u2019s always family if he really needs help but I\u2019m sure he can manage if it\u2019s just the weekend . There\u2019s zero\nNeed for his coworker to be there the only mistake here is her allowing it for two years until it\u2019s reached this point", "He must be sexist for having a female friend help out instead of a male friend then. Dumbass \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "To quote Bailey Sarian, this whole situation is 'suspish'. lol\n\nNo way in Hades would some co-worker friend of my partner be in my home on the reg cuddling with my kid, like what the actual fuck?!", "You got the joke in one. \nSeriously, 12 hr shifts in a windowless room 60 ft underground where you can't leave other than the bathroom.", "Of course I wouldn\u2019t tell my friends SO that they\u2019re a bad mother the first time I met them. That\u2019s not my business, tbh. Even if they were being a bad mother.\n\nNo one should be with someone, tho, who asks to your Facebook password so he can delete a message before you saw it. That woman needs therapy for her insecurities.", "A dude makes a male friend. Describes friend as a super close and so wonderful and so caring and so handsome and so\u2026.. Gives said friend a key to the house and says to come over any time (without the wife\u2019s agreement). Plans to fix up a spare room as an art studio (without  wife\u2019s agreement) so friend can can use it anytime, as much as a he wants (without wife\u2019s agreement.)\n\nNumerous commenters wonder if the relationship is a bit beyond platonic. OP denies it as he is TOTALLY HETEROSEXUAL AND LOVES HIS MARRIAGE. \n\nUntil OP realizes he was never in love with his wife at all and leaves wife to be with friend romantically and sexually.", "Right?! I cuddle with my niece sometimes. However, I am her Aunt! I\u2019ve been in her life since day one. I love her like a daughter, but I respect my sisters role as her mom. I\u2019d never want to take her place. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine cuddling with my coworkers kids. I am friendly with a male coworker, and he\u2019s a father of two. I would never make my self so comfortable in his home while his wife is at work, and cuddle his kids. That\u2019s just freaking weird.", "I often jokingly say \"Long time no see\" to my colleague, if I've been at work with them on a ten hour shift the day before.", "I genuinely agree!! Thankfully I have no idea if she ever did as this happened over 10 years ago, and their relationship (surprisingly) crashed and burned in the most spectacular fashion.", "As an insecure jealous type girl, even i don't think this is 100% true. But rule of thumb, and if you're not trying to play with fire, then it's in your best interest to assume this is true. My guy friends, in my gut i know don't want to bang me. Sure they might not think I'm ugly (they aren't either) but we're not each others types and there's never been an indication of otherwise", "Oh my. Well now.", "Esh- I\u2019m more concerned with whatever she has been being told that she is making absent mom comments/ jokes to your face. And that your husband agreed. Sounds like there is bigger relationship issues going on", "It\u2019s not your own doing, if your husband doesn\u2019t see or  understand where you\u2019re coming from and what Jen is doing wrong then you need to think twice about everything. Why is she always around? Why did he allow her to say those thing? Agreeing with what she said was wrong even if he felt that way he shouldn\u2019t have said it and talked to you in private.", "She says this because she is already the side piece. This is resentment from her coming out. You need to have the talk with your current husband. NTA.", "Did you not read he works part time", "That information was added after my comment.", "Why would you be concerned?", "Because if he gets sole custody with the way he is, who knows who else he\u2019ll bring around their kid. It\u2019s really dangerous.", "Your fucking kidding right? Nothing in this post has any signs of dangerous or abusive behavior. You would have to be delusional to invent any danger. \n\nIs there likely resentment in the relationship, yes, anything actually abusive going on, fucking no dude.", "Ya I\u2019m totally kidding.
