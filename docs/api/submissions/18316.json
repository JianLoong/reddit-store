As a person in the higher-risk category (immunocompromised, over 50), I too have been very careful and continue to mask and get booster shots when available.\n\nNot everyone in my household is as careful, and that's okay. They are all adults who make their own decisions, followed mandates and the science, and we've only had one case of Covid in this house in the past 3 years. The person who caught it secluded themselves and it did not spread.

I know everyone on reddit jumps to therapy (or divorce, lol) right away, but to be clear, I genuinely think therapy is a good idea for just about everybody. There are therapists you can see online, if you are uncomfortable seeing one in person. Most of them have sliding-scale fees to help folks who have difficulty paying.\n\nAs to your adult daughter living in your house and not telling you exactly where she is going at all times and perhaps having sex with other adult people: let it go. She needs to live her life. I don't care what kind of rent she does or doesn't pay, I don't care. She deserves to explore friendships and relationships outside of the four walls of your house.

This is what she found weird.\n\nMaybe she did get the name of the park wrong (it happens, I don't remember the names of small parks), Or maybe she is scared you would follow her or something, since you clearly don't respect her privacy and don't want her to meet people.\n\nShe really needs to move out.", "You also are supposed to respect the boundaries of people you love. So while you are hyper focused on the \"disrespect\" you think she is showing you, you are massively disrespecting her. It's always the ones who think they are always being disrespected that are the most disrespectful to others, narcissism adjacent thinking.", "She did tell you.\n\nDespite having no history of lying to you, you still convinced yourself she must have been lying and had to verify that she was going where she told you.\n\nThat is some paranoid, controlling behaviour.", "Respect is earned. You are inserting your nose into a grown woman's business. You need to stop thinking of her as a child. I haven't really spoken to my mom in about a year because she won't stop treating me like a child. I'm 37 with children of my own.", "You asked, she told you. The issue isn\u2019t that you asked where she was going, the issue is that you then assume she\u2019s lying. Next time are you going to follow her?", "Would you still expect that of her if she didn\u2019t live with you?", "I would have told my mother \"out\". And a time I expected to be back by. This was before mobile phones. You are a couple of years older than me. \nDid you stay at home during the 1980s?", "No.  It's not a matter of respect.", "Maybe \"real\" was a bad choice of words. I just wanted to see what exact park she was going to.", "I have a very compromised immune system. This is never going away entirely. Plus. There\u2019s so many things that you can catch. We can\u2019t quit living and call it life.", "And the fact they have expected their 24 year old daughter to do the same is just crazy to me. My daughter is 24, and she\u2019s been out working, traveling, etc.", "Yeah both my parents are in their mid 60s and are still living full lives. My mom still works in a school, she gets together for dinner with friends at least once a month. My dad\u2019s retired but golfs with a group of friends every week and goes to the gym a few times a week.

That was 3 years ago. Even 2 years ago. The WHO has ended the pandemic. Covid is here to stay. You need to learn to live with it. \n\nWhile people might still die, if you are vaccinated, that is unlikely. You have to live life. \n\nAlso, at 24 many women are married with children. Get a grip!", "As a Microbiologist who's concentration was infectious diseases, you're not going to live forever.\nThis is now endemic and will be seasonal, like the flu is seasonal. We have vaccines that protect from severe illness.\nThere are MANY, and I mean MANY immune compromised people in the world who are able to live lives without crippling themselves.\nYou can live in fear and be miserable the rest of your life, but how dare you expect your daughter to. You're not sucking face with her, don't fucking worry about it. It's not your vagina.", "OP i truley feel sorry for your daughter you sound controlling as fuck. She is a grown woman, if the fact she is living there rent free bothers you charge her rent, if she needed you she would call. Stay out her sex life you freaking weirdo", "YTA but mindless curiosity that I already know the answer to - if the sex was swapped and you had a 24 year old son would you be this overbearing and paranoid about him having sex with and kissing the pretty girls or would you be like \"hell yeah that's my boy go get it champ\"?", "You don\u2019t have the right to decide that and you\u2019re using a pandemic that no longer exists to manipulate and control and adult woman. \n\nCOVID is going to exist for a long time just like a hundred other diseases that can kill you.

You are willing to have your own daughter live a miserable life of no dating and not going anywhere just for your comfort. Maybe she should move, the free rent is not worth the lack of trust.", "The pandemic is over. Life has returned to normal. Are you saying your daughter has had little to no social interactions this past year because you still believe it\u2019s too safe to go out?", "We aren\u2019t in the middle of a pandemic though.", "She's gonna fuck, gramps. She's a grown woman.", "You should seek therapy. It\u2019s one thing to decide to insulate yourself from the rest of the world, but expecting your adult daughter to do so as well is not it. It sounds like your decision has led you into some very paranoid and irrational thinking, and honestly, with all the online programs available it would be a great idea to take advantage of telehealth therapy and get yourself back on track.\n\nAlso, though with sympathy for the situation you\u2019ve created for yourself, YTA.", "The pandemic is over, even the world health organization recently declared it over. Covid is here to stay just like the flu, you need to learn to live with it like any other illness", "We haven't been \"in the middle of a pandemic\" for quite some time. I believe we are now in an endemic (sp?). That means COVID is here to stay. Are you proposing that your daughter should never have a social life?

I was actually hit harder than he was.", "Fortunately you don't own her or make decisions about her body, regardless of your attempts to assert it.  You're an absolute monster, and a classic boomer.  Every comment is downvoted 900x.  It seems like you can't accept the fact you're a huge asshole even though it's abundantly clear.  Take this advice and use it to form a better and more honest relationship with your daughter, and accept her womanhood and freedom.  Talking about you paying the bills makes you the master.  You're not a good father.", "What makes you think we're still in the middle of a pandemic?", "We\u2019re not in the middle of a pandemic, anymore. Yep, covid isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s now endemic, the same way that a lot of viral respiratory infections are. Someone who is immunocompromised has approximately the same risk of death from ANY viral respiratory infection. Are you vaccinated?  Is your daughter?  If not, without a medically sound reason not to be, you\u2019re being ridiculous. She\u2019s 24, not 4, or even 14. She can go around kissing all the strangers she wants (with their consent).  You sound incredibly controlling. I get wanting to have a general idea where your daughter is. I like having a general idea where my 20 year old is.  I also like having a general idea where my septuagenarian parents are, for the same reason. But all of these people are adults. I trust my own parenting enough to (reasonably) know that I raised my daughter well enough to take care of herself. YTA.

I live in a country that was well behind the US in coming out of pandemic controls, and we've been business as usual for months now.

Her meeting up with a guy OR a girl to hang out, doesn't mean she's going to turn into an exhibitionist at the park.  Oh and we're not in a pandemic anymore.

We're not in the middle of a pandemic anymore.", "You need therapy. I mean this seriously.", "Covid is nothing more and nothing less than a flu.

What would you do with this information?", "And....why is that, exactly?", "No, you felt out of control because you obviously can't tell her no, so you instead want to know every detail.
