It is an undeniable statement of challenge. \n\nThank you for putting it this way. Everyone in here, unsurprisingly, is being pretty dismissive of the shirt's (and therefore the wearer's) intent. It's pretty obvious it's meant to be provocative, and I dont blame someone for getting offended by it.", "Huge difference between \"telling someone to follow your set of codes and values\" and just recognizing that it's being intentionally antagonistic (asshole-ish) to wear a t-shirt that mocks their religion by endorsing Satanic behavior. You can be free to do something and still be an asshole for doing it.", "Did you read the post? They were traveling and went to a famous chain of dive bars so OP didn't even think about what she was wearing.", "Me too. I just thought it was hilarious that he pretended not to understand that it was about beer, not the sun.\n\nAt that age, kids just want to push the boundaries a bit.", "it is my pleasure to confirm that typo was entirely intentional ;)", "So actually not protected eh?", "The dude literally demanded that she change her top, and the reason he was mad was because she didn't. He thinks his religion entitles him to tell other people what to do, and apparently you do too. Being religious does not mean the rest of the world is obliged to baby you and tiptoe around your superstitions.", "I like you!", "Wait then who are they? Cause no one really pops out in my mind as being overly religious and I don\u2019t really think that group had faded into relative obscurity by the time I was growing up.", "For someone who is religious, sure. OP is not religious and therefore likely doesn\u2019t view demons in this context. To her, it\u2019s just a funny t-shirt.", "Christianity is not the only place where demons are present. As a Christian myself, demons aren\u2019t even talked about very much in typical practice. To me the shirt is more about witchcraft. How about realize that not everything is about you.", "Not sure what point you think you made, but Protected Class is a legal term", "We're talking about OP, not if the uncle overreacted and could have let it go or not. The Uncle was offended because of OP's asshole behavior. This is very basic social etiquette. Obviously you think religion is stupid and thus fair game to go to town on, but this is not how general society outside of the internet views this sort of interaction.", "iirc, one of the air traffic controller higher ups arrives at the airport and basically punches a bunch of hari krishna's trying to get to the through to the control room", "The funny is being irreverent of religion.\n\nIts like wearing a shirt saying \"steak is amazing\" and then walking about India.  Like putting on a shirt saying \"I need a sandwitch\" and attending a feminist rally as a man or going to a protest about police brutallity against black people with a shirt saying \"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time\" etc.\n\nEach of those examples is \"funny\" way to openly mock people who really care about a specific issue that you don't.  If you want to make that choice, you need to accept people will be offended and you'll provoke them.", ">How about realize that not everything is about you.\n\nI'm not the target of that shirt, I don't find it offensive at all.  If I lived in palces where idiots took that too seriously I might very well buy one myself.  I still understand that it is tagetted mockery of something some people feel very strongly about.\n\n>As a Christian myself, demons aren\u2019t even talked about very much in typical practice.\n\nYeah, its a specific subset of busybodies that focus on that as it basically gives them the justification they feel they need to impose things onto others.  A genertation of people taking the piss out of them for it has likely made them change their tactics.\n\nBut those same groups are currently attacking reproductive rights, pulling books from schools and promoting anti-science ideas.  That problem is real.", "Wearing a shirt that pisses off a religious person for reasons that are entirely personal to said offended party while not being an act of aggression is not an attack towards a protected class, it's simply the asshole uncle not minding his business.  You're creating a whole to-do over literally nothing", "We're getting upset because you are being deliberately obtuse and going out of your way to condemn someone who literally did nothing wrong", "All of those examples are direct challenges to people, some quite offensive. If I wore those, I\u2019m obviously asking for trouble, and going to find it. OPs t-shirt was not worn as a direct challenge to the ethics of her uncle. If she wore it to church, I\u2019d agree with you. But to a casual lunch with family, it\u2019s totally different.", "I agree, OP was being an immature edge lord and should grow up. If I was her dad I would be raging about driving all that way for a family occasion for it to be ruined by a deliberately provocative unnecessary act. It is totally hypocrisy for the many people here to claim that offending people doesn\u2019t matter because there is now an almost unlimited number of things you can do to offend somebody yet somehow spiritual beliefs don\u2019t have the same protection.", "A satanic shirt would be considered \"aggressive\" to religious people, yes."]}
