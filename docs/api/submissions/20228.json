My uncle looked at my t-shirt and immediately hissed at me asking what I was thinking wearing a t-shirt like that in public and to go back to the hotel and change. I refused because I didn't want to walk all the way back to the hotel in a thunderstorm just to change my t-shirt (the hotel is about a five minute walk away but I didn't want to delay people getting their food for fifteen minutes while I walked there, changed and came back, and also it was raining cats and dogs).\n\n\nThe t-shirt in question has a joking picture of the cover one of those vintage kids books published by ladybug in the 50s.

I hate to see my dad stressed and it really was only a short walk back to the hotel to change. From my POV I really don't think the t-shirt is even that offensive however I totally recognise that I might have been the asshole for being stubborn rather than just changing.

If he'd offended by your t-shirt I dread to think how he'd react to sheer amount of blow being done of the backs of the loos at all hours of the day or the sheer evil their kitchen can sometimes conjour up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHare-Kirshna are generally a lot nicer too. I got stopped by one whilst waiting to meet a metal band years ago. Got talking and he was selling the books etc but also CD's from the Hare-Krishna metal band \"The Gouranga Powered Band\".

I have pissed off so many uncles haha", "NTA. Your uncle needs a hobby. And NOT one that involves staring at teenage girls, like he does now.
