He knows I\u2019m very clingy towards him because he\u2019s my first basically everything in a relationship. Our morning routine consists of me waking up around 6:45, then I take a shower, and then I go downstairs to make breakfast for the both of us and pack his lunch. Then my boyfriend wakes up around 7:15 and goes to shower and gets ready cans comes down around 7:45.\n\nMy boyfriend works in investment banking so he\u2019s usually very busy but our intimate life has been lacking lately as he has this big project he has to focus on. Last Friday, I decided to change things up as I woke up and I made breakfast and packed his lunch first, and then I went back upstairs when my boyfriend woke up and I told him I wanted to shower together. To my surprise, he told me no and that it was his space to get his mind off things to start the day. I honestly was pretty disappointed and I thought he didn\u2019t see me the same way sexually he once did, but I let him shower by himself regardless, but I decided the to take the towel in one of our cabinets for later.\n\nOnce I heard his shower was finished, I heard him asking me where the towel had gone, and I told him in a playful manner that I had taken it and I wanted him to chase me. I heard him frustrated behind the door and he just dried himself off with something else. When he came out he seemed very upset and just left for work immediately and didn\u2019t eat my breakfast or lunch I had packed for him. I was honestly offended by that and I asked him to talk about it over the weekend. When I asked him why he didn\u2019t want to shower together he said because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cspend every waking second\u201d with me. I already had some pent up sadness so I just burst into tears into his arms but he didn\u2019t really handle it very well. He tells me that he\u2019s gonna be firm about showering by himself and doesn\u2019t want me to pull anymore antics. He said that it\u2019s gonna be like this until his project is done, which I have no idea when that will happen.

He expressed that he wanted his shower time to be peaceful. That's not an invitation to antagonize him the second his shower is over. He's clearly feeling smothered by you and needs some space. You should give him some.", "YTA and I think you need to grow up.\n\nHe gave a good reason for not wanting to shower together, that it's his space to get his head in the right space for work, and even knowing he's having a busy time at work, you took this to mean he wasn't as interested in you sexually. The world doesn't revolve around you, you should've believed his explanation.\n\nTaking his towel because you're insecure and wanted him to chase you around the house (seriously, how old are you) was a terrible idea. To him, it must feel like he's talking to a brick wall, and that you don't care about what he wants or feels, you're just seeking attention and validation from him.\n\nYou knew he's got something big going on at work, but instead of supporting him you're making his life more difficult. Don't be offended he didn't eat your food, did you expect him to be grateful after the games you played?\n\nThis is the sort of stuff that'd be a deal-breaker for me, you need to start taking him seriously. You need to start taking his job seriously, I imagine an investment banker would be reluctant to put their job at risk over their partner even if it's the love of their life. If I were you I'd apologise and work on giving him space when he needs it.", "He probably didn't have time for this. What you thought woukd a fun tryst, he thought \"I'm going to be late.\"\n\nYou need to calm down. There is a time to be playful, and there is a time to be a grown-up. \n\nPlan a date night, THAT'S when you bring out sexy games.", "YTA\nHe very clearly stated that he wanted to use his shower time to get his head in work mode. \n\nSo why would you then choose to mess around with this and take his towel?\n\nYou really need to back off some \u2014 your comment that you \u2018burst into tears into his arms\u2019 but that \u2018he didn\u2019t handle it very well\u2019 makes me think you are really exhausting, and he\u2019s just looking for some \u2018him time\u2019\n\nQuit being so clingy and allow him some breathing room!", "YTA and you\u2019re going to push him away if you keep this shit up. Give him space.", "Oh give the guy some space. You are admittedly clingy so recognize that and try and control yourself.  He has a morning routine. He needs his morning routine.  Leave him alone and don\u2019t follow him into the bathroom. \n\nAnd you are way over the top the AH for stealing his towel. That was not cute or sexy at all. Just childish and petty.", "YTA. Jesus Christ it\u2019s a stage 4 clinger. Give the man some space or he will dump you. You already said that is HIS time to get in a headspace for the day. You then taking the towel and messing up his routine when you KNOW he has a lot going on and that is his time, is just plain disrespectful.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to learn about consent, and respect that NO means NO.", "YTA. He said no, you decided you could tease him into giving you attention anyway. \n\nI'd recommend you maybe focus on doing your own things in the morning (when he's preparing for a big project at work). Maybe he has more mental space for \"play\" in the evening when he's home again?\n\nAnd making his breakfast and lunch may not be the best for how you feel about yourself in this relationship right now.", "Girl he clearly wasnt tryna play YTA \n\nlike others are sayin tho yall gottta discuss your intimacy", "Yikes let him breathe YTA", "You sound like a lot. Your behaviour was needy (as you already acknowledged) and childish. You need to back off and let him have his space, especially since he\u2019s stressed. If you push harder he\u2019s going to start resenting you. Taking the towel was ridiculous and childish. Something like that would set my morning routine off kilter and could se the tone for my day. You need to apologize and then back off.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nMorning routine can be important, especially when you take the time to get your thoughts together for the day. Especially if he\u2019s been working on a big project and may have a presentation or something.", "YTA. Most people don't feel like intimacy all the time. Sometimes they're just not in the mood. He has his routine and he doesn't want to be disturbed. He told you that, respect it. It's fine that you're trying to reignite the intimacy in your relationship but there's a time and place for it", "YTA. \n\nSo he is looking to prep for his day and get ready for work instead of having sexy time.  Instead of just accepting he says no, you act like a child and take his towel.  Then. you bring it up another day and start crying, and get mad when he doesn't just comfort you?\n\nA healthy sex life is important, but you can't just decide that because YOU want it right now, that he must be up for it.", ">so I just burst into tears into his arms\n\nGirl, bye.", "YTA he said no and that should've been that. he probably would've appreciated the breakfast and the lunch had you not stepped over his boundary", "YTA\u2026.for so many reasons.\n\nI once dumped a girl because within a month, she told me that \u201cshe would be sad if I said I wanted alone time\u201d\n\nYeah, I got out early and don\u2019t regret it", "YTA... how to lose a guy in 10 days...\n\nYou are acting very disrespectful. He has to go to work, has a project to complete, the last thing anyone needs is this drama before the day even begins. \n\nHis reaction makes it clear that this is a pattern of behavior from you and he has to set his boundaries. it's nice you made him breakfast but does he even eat breakfast? it sounds like you are forcing yourself on him and doing nice things for him for your own personal gain.", "YTA.  You need to throttle back on this.  You are going to 'cling' this relationship to death.  And the whole \"I want you to chase me\" bit is aggravating.  Then when he tells you he doesn't want to spend every waking moment with you, you respond by attaching yourself to him bodily?  He didn't handle that well?  Um... well, of course not.  You deliberately completely blew off what he had told you.", "YTA 1st showers together suck! 2 he is working on a big project he\u2019s stress not the best time in the morning before work. 3 your young it\u2019s showing", "it sounds like you dont givea your partner any alone him time becuase as you admitted your a clingon.  and by the way investment banking is a stressful enough job that if he has things on his mind like the project then it is what it is.  i think you need to learn some boundaries and find perhaps a hobby or friends to help ease the clingyness.", "Yta. All my life i have been told i have to listen to when a woman says the word no. I guess the message doesn\u2019t go both fucking ways and its only men who get taught what that word means. \n\nNo means fucking no. Regardless of gender.", "YtA, stop making this about you, and think about what your boyfriend is going through. You know he has a big project at work. He's probably under a tremendous amount of stress.  You need to ask yourself what can I do to help and support my partner instead of playing childish games", "YTA. He's clearly busy with things but you forced your plans onto him and basically ignored what he had to say. Both of you need to converse about the issues with your intimacy at the right time, when both of you are not busy with anything.", "YTA\n\nYou asked to shower together, nothing wrong with that, and he said no. That should have been the end of it. I know it\u2019s tough, but don\u2019t read into lack of intimacy as him looking differently at you. When couples are busy and stressed the intimacy is the first thing to suffer.", "Yta. \nI'm clingy and love showers with my bf, but I respect it when he wants a shower alone ESPECIALLY in the morning. \nIf anything, morning showers are different from evening showers. See if he'd be open to that instead.", "Sometimes positive intentions have negative impact. Drill down and put yourself on the receiving end.", "YTA....\n\nGood Grief, he has a lot of responsibilities at work.  Get freaky on Friday night,  weekend mornings, or weekend whatever's.  Don't mess with his morning routine.  \n\nGet yourself a good toy and seek your own pleasure without him.", "YTA\n\nGirl, get your clingy ass to therapy.", "YTA. The guy was trying to get ready for work. There\u2019s a time and place for that nonsense, and that wasn\u2019t it.", "He told you he wanted his space and you thought \u201cokay, I\u2019ll steal his towel and make him chase me through the house!\u201d?\n\nYTA.", "YTA - If you already know that you\u2019re \u201cclingy\u201d, what are you doing to work on it? Are you in therapy? Do you have interests and people in your life outside of your husband?", "YTA it\u2019s not acceptable to be this needy and boundary stomping. Nothing you did was cute or reasonable. A million yards of ick. Apologise and back the hell out of his personal space. Clingy gross stuff like what you\u2019re doing is what ends relationships and justifiably so.", "YTA. if the situation was reversed and he tried to coerce you into sexy games, it would be called attempted rape.  Grow up and quit acting like a clingy baby, or you will be a single baby before ling.", "YTA He doesn't want to shower with you, and if you are self proclaimed \"clingy\" then his statement about not wanting to spend every single moment together is accurate. You need to work on your clinginess OP because sometimes showering is just about bathing and it doesn't have to be an intimate moment. I suggest heavily working on your self esteem so you don't turn every glance (or normal desire to bathe) into a personal rejection.", "YTA and very needy. Respect that man\u2019s boundaries or end the relationship. Not everything has to turn into \u201csexy time\u201d.", "You sound very immature.", "YTA\n\nSweet girl, this isn\u2019t a romance novel. When you\u2019ve got to work every day in a demanding job and you\u2019re stressed\u2026morning is not the time to live out a Hallmark fantasy. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself. Get independent. Get hobbies.", "YTA you sound really, really annoying.", "Kinda YTA. I mean, good attempt, but as a slow riser, I can totally understand how he'd want or need those minutes in the shower to get himself awake and ready for the day. The bit with the towel, tho, not cool. Sounds like you two should be talking about your issues.", "First of all you're clingy because you're clingy...not because this is your first relationship! He apparently doesn't like the clingy stuff and seems overly stressed about this project. Now obviously he shouldn't be taking that out on you, but you should also give him some grace as he handles this stress. Hopefully after the project is done you can reconnect and calmly decide how to handle things like this in the future. But for now just back off and try not to take it personal.", "YTA. you purposely crossed a clear boundary set by your partner. you sound clingy, needy and kind of pathetic. he'll probably dump you soon", "YTA. Not for asking, but for not accepting that he didn\u2019t want to. And then for taking the towel - it\u2019s not playful and cute, it\u2019s annoying and unkind. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to spend every possible second together. Give him some space and work on being less clingy before you mess this relationship up entirely.", "Soft YTA \u2014 sounds like you have some attachment issues. I suggest you get into therapy before you drive him away. Before too long you\u2019re going to sabotage this relationship if you haven\u2019t already. I guarantee he\u2019s already at least wondering how much more of this he can take.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That sounds like he feels smothered by you. And you admit you are clingy and needy. I would encourage you to plan a girls night, or plan to visit your parents, without him, for a weekend. He needs some alone time to recharge. I know it may sound like he doesn't want to be with you.... but really, it isn't about you. If you don't acknowledge and respect his need to decompress, his frustration and resentment will reach a boiling point, and he will break up with you. You need to give him space, dear.

Try talking it out more cuz the lack of intimacy is a red flag. And when he says he doesn\u2019t wanna spend every waking moment together, you can tell he needs a little space.

Then he may warm to the idea of showering gradually.\n\nAsk Dolly signing off.", "Seems a one sided thread. If you are focused so much on work, that you cannot acknowledge your partner of 3 years trying to get attention sexually, then maybe its time to talk about the future. Unless you are not explaining a lot of details, what actually would be wrong with spending 5 minutes playfully giving your girlfriend some primal lovemaking over the counter making her feel as wanted as your completed project? As a man also dedicated to work mentality I always make sure no matter what I tend to business at home as well as work. If she for one instant feels I am not attracted to her, I straighten it out right there. She needs to be as supportive to him as much as he needs to acknowledge her needs. Men seem to be focused on themselves all to often. Imagine being with this person for many years, signs of neglect come early on. I would ask who else is he fucking?", "NTA.... If like you said...

You're trying to play games because you feel you're not getting enough attention.

Maybe you should try to be more supportive instead of trying to figure out ways to make everything about you.", "YTA. If you keep this up you will end up pushing him away.", "YTA. You sound immature and exhausting, and like you think the world revolves around you. He has an important, stressful business project. He works in a high-pressure field. Your response to this is to make it all about you, annoy him after he set clear boundaries, and the start sobbing like a child bc\u2026he wants to shower alone? \n\nDo you have a job or something to focus on?", "YTA. clingy becomes needy becomes dependent", "Cans come down!", "\u06c3\u0648. \u0635", "YTA. You do realize this level of immaturity should've ended in middle school, right?", "YTA, he knows I'm super clingy because... No, you need to grow up. No one wants someone needing them every second. It's exhausting to have someone that emotionally needy. If you are old enough to be in a serious relationship, you are old enough to respect boundaries. Sounds like your BF is tired of his being disrespected constantly. Get some therapy and give him some space before he walks away.", "YTA, and you either need a h\nJob, a hobby, or something. You are smothering him. Lord that expecting him to chase you when he's trying to get ready for work would be so annoying. If you are this insecure, you are not ready for an adult relationship. Passion cools as relationships progress. People get busy and have their own stress. You are not in a movie and it's time to do some growing up", "YTA\nHe doesn\u2019t want sexy games when he is getting ready for work. Play on your day off", "I don't think YTA, but you'll have to re-evaluate your needs and expectations for the relationship.  He's obviously not the spontaneous romantic type, focuses on his job and needs his space to do that.  If that's acceptable for you, then just change the way to relate to him and find other ways to help take his mind off things when he's ready for that.  If you need that  clingy relationship and react in a bad way to being denied or rejected sometimes, then your personalities may clash and it will only get worse.\n\nSo no, NTA, but you'll have to do some thinking as to whether or not this is the right relationship for you.\n\nEdit: I strongly disagree with the posts saying she needs to grow up, stop being so clingy, change the way she does things.  Disagree.  Maybe she's just that clingly type of person and trying to supress her own character will only make her depressed and feeling like she isn't good enough being herself.  There's nothing wrong with being clingy and spontaneous as long as you find a partner that enjoys that sort of thing. Lots of people do, and there's nothing wrong with being that way.", "YTA\n\nHe wants and needs to work, and specifically told you so. In no way it has anything to do with his sexual desire. \nImagine wanting to get ready to work and someone hiding my towel, ffs.\nDo you really need to bother him moments before he heads off to work?\nIB is very stressful and sounds like you are not helping him either.", "YTA. It\u2019s not concerning that you wanted to shower with him, but there are a couple of things about the situation that are concerning - 1.  You jumped from \u201che doesn\u2019t want to shower with me this one day\u201d to \u201che doesn\u2019t sexually desire me any more\u201d. That\u2019s a huge leap, and 2. Your use of the word \u201clet\u201d. Like, you let him shower alone? What was your alternative? Jumping in with him regardless? That\u2019s just gross, if you worded it that way intentionally. \n\nAs for the rest of it - I wouldn\u2019t have taken the breakfast/lunch either if you had tried to turn my morning into your own personal attention-seeking game by taking my towel so I would chase you. I literally would have left for work and only come back to get my stuff. The fact that he not only stuck around, but continued to stick around after you had a dramatic breakdown in his arms over a situation where he did absolutely nothing wrong speaks to the fact that he loves you\u2026and I can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s what you were trying to \u201cprove\u201d with that whole display. \n\nYour behavior isn\u2019t healthy, nor is it sustainable if you want to stay in your relationship. Whether it\u2019s self-help or professional help, I would really encourage you to find a way to evaluate what you feel is acceptable behavior. The excessive clingyness may feel good in the moment, but there is no way anyone is going to stick around if that\u2019s the day to day norm. The people we care about have lives outside of us, and that\u2019s okay.", "YTA and acting like a teenager. Honestly, I don\u2019t think this relationship is good for you OR him, why are you 23 spending your time making breakfast daily for some dude? Does he ever do that kind of stuff for you? Are you advancing in your career?\nGo jump start your career, party hard, stay out late, make friends, get your own work hustle, etc. That\u2019s the issue, not the shower!", "YTA. Give the man some space. If you are concerned about a lack of intimacy, there\u2019s a mature way to have a conversation with him about that. Trying to continue to push him into intimacy at times he specifically said no (and he is probably tired and stressed on top of that) is not okay.", "YTA. You're immature and annoying.", "YTA Showering together is good for sexy time and can be nice _after_ work. But in the morning, when you need to get ready for work, there\u2019s no time for such things.", "Maybe he takes a dump before shower and didn\u2019t want you to be around for the after smell.", "YTA you are overbearing leave the man his space", "Respect his boundaries", "Nah all these people are wierdos OP you're NTA. You wanted to pass about with your boyfriend and he shut it down in a really rude way. To be fair the morning isn't necessarily the best time to pick your moment, but the most important thing is to be kind & have fun not your silly work project, this guys priorities are all wrong", "Got a stage 5 clinger here.", "OP is a stage 5 clinger for sure. The best part is the more he asks for space the harder she\u2019s gonna cling.", "OP seems to be influenced by movies alot. These things should be left for reel life only.", "This. I would be furious if my partner got in the way of me getting ready for work because he\u2019d decided we were going to have sex.", "OP, this is the perfect reply \u2b06\ufe0f", "Sing it to the back of the room!  Thank you!", "If you haven't found her yet, keep looking! \n\nI explained to my husband on our 3rd or 4th date that I need lots of time alone and that I am not social in the morning. \nHe said that was perfect - I was a little suspicious because I had hit that particular reef before,  despite being upfront about needing lots of space. \n\nHe wasn't lying! \n\n Over 20 years now.\n\nHis job keeps him away from home about half the time and when he is home, angel that he is , he waits until he hears me getting my second cup of coffee before he even says \"good morning \" and it really is OK for me to say \"I am peopled out, going to play hermit for a while \"\n\nThey exist and it's awesome to be able get the breathing room you need without  anyone feeling rejected.", "Thank you for saying this.  And yes.  It goes for girls, too.", "Yes, because every woman acts like OP did in this situation. Lame.", "How is he \"taking it out\" on her? He was perfectly reasonable until she started acting the fool, and even afterwards he was extraordinarily patient. She sounds exhausting.", "Yeah the \u201csobbing in his arms\u201d was \ud83e\udd2e. OP is super immature and annoying. I bet he breaks up with her before his project is over.", "I like what you did there", "Oh, this was many moons ago, my friend. I have indeed found someone", "I\u2019ve found my people here! I tend to get \u201cpeopled out\u201d and want to \u201cplay hermit\u201d every once in a while. Next time I\u2019m gonna use these phrases to explain to my friends before disappearing and have some alone time.", "I shouldn\u2019t even have to point this out! Its fucking ridiculous.", "calm down.", "Nah she breaks up with him because she doesn't get enough affection, bet", "YAY!", "OP needs to get herself a toy and spice up her own life.  If she wants something else, it absolutely has to be consensual.", "She needs a puppy.  A really affectionate,  needy puppy. A velcro breed like a Maltese or Papillion."]}
