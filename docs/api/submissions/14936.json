I did a 7 day Alaska cruise on one of the smaller/cheaper ships and it sucked.\n\nThere was very little to do on the ship and it was very boring. My kids were were adults and they were also bored silly.  I can only imagine how bad that trip would have been with smaller kids.\n\nOne of the few activities they had was a cooking class where they had a bunch of cooking stations where you'd follow along with the instructor to make yourself a gourmet meal.  We found out once we were actually aboard that it was only like that on the bigger ships.  For our ship you just sat on folding chairs and watched the presenter cook.", "I figured that was a quote from her, not his point of view.", "I'm married and if my husband suggested what this wife is I'd lay out a spread sheet for him to show him why the already planned trip is a better option (including the child activities available on the already booked cruise) and ask why exactly this one isn't good enough.", "u/RuleNo112 is a bot.", "u/Vegetable_Effect_496 is a bot.", "The devil works hard but you\u2019re working harder to put the blame on everyone except the adult woman here.", "I think the commenter meant \u201cthey\u201d as in the friends who are trying to convince her to have it changed to a bigger ship. I could be wrong though.", "u/National_Profit7502 is a bot.", "Absolutely NTA. She is being thoroughly unreasonable, ungrateful and entirely feckless in re finances.", "She\u2019s nuts. Why does she care so much about the way people see her vs the way she actually is? That\u2019s nuts. No one is gonna like her more just cause she went on a more expensive cruise, lol especially not her husband. Which is the only person\u2019s opinion she should even care about \ud83d\ude39", "Then boo on the wife.", "There's the info I was scrolling for. Defo NTA then.\n\nIgnoring the money aspect. We travel quite a bit. Plans get changed, shit happens, things come up, other opportunities arise, etc...one big thing we did to cut down on associated frustration was make a rule that any forced change is dealt with by whoever has done the booking for ease, and any desired changes are dealt with by the person who wants to make that change if it's a pain in the ass. It's unfair otherwise and it causes resentment to do the work twice so someone else can have their way. And so in my fam this would all be on my wife to sort (and let's be real, for all this would take several days of pounding your head into the wall, which is a large part of why it's such a ridiculous request at this point).", "If she helped plan the current trip and the trip she now wants us outside of the family budget then you\u2019re NTA.\n\nAnd if by chance she comes up with a plan that\u2019s affordable and you\u2019ll both be happy with, she should handle making the changes.", "Recognising what things you really enjoy is important for vacations.\n\nI mean, large comfortable hotel rooms, central location, fantastic dinners, great museums, interesting tours, luxury cocktails, popular shows, great seats at shows are all the perfect vacation for someone.\n\nBut you generally can't pick them all so get the cheap hotel close to everything or the nice hotel and Metro to the sites, etc, etc...\n\nIn this case, switching to \"nicer\" cruise would likely not be enough. So then you're buying all the extras anyhow.\n\nThen you're broke", "don't forget the fees associated with changing all of those plans too", "It may be a quote from her but gives some insight into the dynamic of the parenting.  Just something I noticed.", "NTA this is \"keep up with the Joneses\" straight into bankruptcy.\n\nAlaska has fantastic wild landscapes, so if she insists, I recommend \"upgrading\" to a backpacking trip.", ">My wife also works and we have shared finances. This trip was paid for by both of us equally. I just handled all of the logistics.\n\nFrom another of OP's comments.", ">Why does she care so much about the way people see her vs the way she actually is?\n\nI mean...  OP implied that her rich friends are influencing her...  but SHE says she wants a bigger boat because it will have more activities for the children, which is probably true.  The larger the boat, the larger the number of common area activities.\n\nWe have no reason to think this is about Mommy-blogger, instagram, whatever stuff.", "I'll never understand going super expensive on hotel rooms.  I am in a place to see things not sit in my room.  If it has a bed and is clean then it's good enough.  Even for a cruise unless the idea is to have a nice enough room you can enjoy it from the cabin but that still sounds lame.", "Could also be the family in the port city have already made plans for the day that would be cut out because of the changes. She'll get to deal with that too.", "I realize this. But his wife still seems to not be realistic about what they can afford. So, if she was to plan a trip, he would be expected to pay for her going overboard because of the shared finances.", "Sure, but the financial tradeoff means they can do more excursions from the smaller boat. So they can have more different experiences, which hopefully will also be enjoyable for the kids. Looking at a prior post from last year, the kids will be 13 and 9, so there\u2019s lots of scope for them to enjoy the excursions. (Mind you, the prior post also says these are both boys with ADHD who can be a handful, so I can see why OP\u2019s wife is looking for break opportunities.)", "Logistics are everything. Unknitting and re-knitting this sweater will be a nightmare and i can guarantee there will be holes.\n\nHonestly, tell her let\u2019s leave as is and she can totally plan the next one.", "I plan a lot of trips with my family (I'm not married, but my sibling and my mom). I plan them because I have the budget to, but the money isn't what matters - my feelings would be pretty hurt if they did nothing but shit on the hotel I picked, the activities I booked ahead of time, etc. \n\nPlanning those things is an act of love, for me at least. I think your wife is being unreasonable, but I also want to say specifically - I'm sorry if your feelings are hurt because the logistics you put time and effort into are being treated as \"not good enough\". Personally, I would feel really rejected, and that sucks.", "Wouldn't be my choice. \n\nBut if someone is disabled or in a chronic pain, a comfortable bed may be non negotiable.\n\nIf you have young children, a larger room and access to play areas may be key to happiness.\n\nSo it can work", "Honestly -- even just a day of lazing around, watching cartoons in bed at the hotel during a vacation, especially a longer one, it can be really enjoyable. It sure is nice to go around, visit and all, but I need to rest sometimes, too. \n\nIt gets exhausting after a few days in a row of visiting, walking, driving, seeing new stuff.", ">But his wife still seems to not be realistic about what they can afford.\n\nWe don't know that for sure.  We know OP thinks it will be too much money to spend, but we can't say whether that's true because we don't actually know their budget.", "I personally really like the idea of a day of rest during a longer vacation. Breakfast in bed? Watching tv for a few hours? Taking a nap. Vacations are also made to rest a bit. \n\nI have a very physical job, so if I'm taking time off I especially need to rest.", "Joint finances are two yes situations when dealing with luxury items. The OP has a right to set a boundary on how much he\u2019s willing to spend on luxuries."]}
