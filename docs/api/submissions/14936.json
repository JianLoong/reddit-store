Smaller ship, you get what you get. There's a pool, kids club etc (the arcade is pricey, I don't recommend), standard shows basically the regular cruise experience. \n\nPlus with an Alaska cruise... A lot of the extra stuff is unusable. Like... Water slides? Surfing? It's cold. Even in August when we went out was to cold for that stuff and most of the outside stuff was closed either due to it being cold, under populated or windy. \n\nPersonally I'd rather have the drink package and some great excursions. Going on a larger ship is unlikely to keep the kids out of her hair... The kids and teen club hours are the same no pretty much no matter what ship you are on. Doesn't matter.\n\nNTA", "Maybe I missed it, but did he consult her on any of this, or did he just make all these decisions and plans without her input? Is this their usual dynamic? If so, I'd consider him to be very controlling.", "Yup. This right here. Vacations are expensive, you've got a wonderful one all booked and paid for. Hell if she doesn't want to go I will lol. \nNTA and have a great time while your wife sulks", "Good suggestion! She wants the kids out of her hair, so leave her at home and enjoy the trip with the kids!", "That sounds so unhinged.\n\nLike, how did she come back from that? Throw the weeds away, wash her hands and say \"okay let's go\"?\n\nMy father was the one who tormented us, but he was just aggressive-aggressive about it, so everyone was crying, or fighting, or frightened. \n\nSorry such things happened to you. I hope you're free and happy now, in a safe place!", "While we don't send our kids to sleepaway camp every year so we can go on vacation without them, it's definitely an added bonus.", "Plus you get to go to bed whenever you want, get up as late as you want and eat whenever you are hungry. God my birthday Cruise was relaxing away from our 3 kids.", "I was way early for a cruise once and sat outside the terminal while the last cruisers were leaving. The families, no matter the age of the kids, looked so tired and frustrated. They did not appear to have had a good time at all", "NTA stand your ground and hopefully she will stay home. The only change I would make would be booking her a room as far away from you and the kids as possible.", "Obviously nta, but as someone who has been on a decent number of cruises........ Why do people like bigger ships? Bigger ships = more people = more lines, more wait, more busyness. In contrast.... Consider that more expensive lines (viking, regent, oceania, etc) all have smaller ships because they're more exclusive, because people pay more so there's a lower staff to customer ratio, because who the fuck wants to stand in line their entire vacation?", "NTA she is trying to impress her friends by changing to a bigger ship. You\u2019ve already made all the arrangements and PAID for it already. You can\u2019t just change all that without at least incurring fees if the allow you to change it at all. She is being unreasonable.", "I used to live in one of the ports you'll be visiting.  I can't imagine wanting to be on a bigger ship. The more people in port each day, the more chaotic the towns will be and the less time and patience guides will have.  NTA.", "NTA", "Don't do it. She had plenty of time for input and didn't. Let her stay TF home", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t help plan, it\u2019s wayyyy too late to change the cruise now. Also money.", "I worked on cruise ships for years. The smaller ships are so much better for something like an Alaskan cruise. The bigger ships can be better in the Caribbean. What are the activities offered on the bigger ship that aren't offered on the smaller ship? Also, this. Is Alaska. It will be chilly, so you won't be lounging by the pool on any ship.", "Nta.", "NTA, sounds like she is keeping up with the Jones instead of making memories with the family.", "Good point. The bigger ships have to dock away from the action so you spend more time on transport buses than is really necessary", "Ah yes.  Just make sure op gets zero vacation after planning the entire trip just to make his ungrateful spouse even more ungrateful", "NTA", "Well, he's married to her, isn't he? They're not getting divorced before the trip, but you think he'd be better off dealing with her unpleasantness the whole time? Now YATA.", "I'm not sure why he has to make sure she doesn't have to be a parent the whole trip just to satisfy her tantrum.  She can stay home if seeing her children is that much of a burden.", "Sounds like my exhusband. The running joke was \u201care you sure you don\u2019t want to just refinish the floors real quick before we go?\u201d We were late for literally everything because he felt the need to do things that he put off for weeks right before we had to leave for something.", "I hope he\u2019s doing well now.", "Well damn.", "Because if the kids don't have a good time-- and she seems ready to persuade them of this-- then he ends up with a whole household displeased. Try living in that environment with any enjoyment.", "Yeah. Now you realize I'm looking at the long game, but you're unwilling to concede I'm correct.", "Honestly it was so common, waiting for an hour for her to dawdle was a weekly occurrence. I truthfully don\u2019t remember it, it\u2019s my father\u2019s story. Definitely not eventful enough to be a core memory. The best strategy was to bring a book everywhere and endure. Some people\u2019s only purpose in life is testing the patience of others so we can practice rising above it. I\u2019m 40 now and I enjoy the hell out of being a great parent right in her face! And enjoying my home I keep clean and maintaining long term friendships, feats neither of them can achieve. I\u2019m pretty all right now and I hope you are too!", "She\u2019d probably be less of an asshole if she lived in a weed legal state.", "He\u2019s not polite, he\u2019s a bitch. No nerve to stand up to anyone in real life, and because of that he\u2019s not a happy person. Know your worth and don\u2019t let people trample you.", "Ha! My stepsister describes her best as being able to spend an hour and a thousand bucks in a shit factory, I\u2019ve never heard anything more accurate! I lie to her by an hour about when my planes land so I don\u2019t seethe at the arrivals curb waiting on her purposefully inconsiderate self. At their first marriage counseling session she was late and my father said she\u2019d arrive at a quarter after. When that was exactly what happened the therapist gave him a validating little nod, that\u2019s one of his other favorite moments.", "My husband took our kids on vacation last summer while my pregnant butt stayed home because I couldn't handle the trip. \n\nI vomited every day while feeding our pets and slept sitting up on the couch because of my acid reflux while also dealing with insomnia and I'm pretty sure I still had a more relaxing week than he did.", "Not really.  He's just going to be an asshole if he also has no fun or break on a trip he planned and paid for.  I'm pretty sure the win is just to ignore the wife", ">no fun or break on a trip he planned\n\nThe guy sounds excited about a trip he himself planned fully. You think he'll have no fun. Why? Because you'd have no fun with your kids unless you got a break from them? It's a family trip, for Pete's sake.", "NTA. Not only would you be having to pay more for this cruise, you\u2019ll be out penalties for cancelling the 1st cruise & rebooking everything else. You can have a great time on a smaller ship as well as a larger ship. More activities doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to more fun.", "One thing that our parents have instilled in me and my husband are, never stretch your leg more than your bed. NTA, don't change anything. You know the budget that won't hurt your life and stick to it. Don't ever go in debt for a vacation ever. You never know what emergency might be waiting for you around the corner!", "Shes the asshole", "She\u2019s being unreasonable and why have kids if she wants them out of her hair so much on vacation?", "Your wife sounds very immature. She wants to live outside her means and cut out a large part of a FAMILY trip so that she can look cool to her friends? Tell her congrats on her upcoming high school graduation!! Surely, only a shallow teenager acts like this...", "NTA she's on some keeping up with the Joneses BS, though I wonder if less time with family (including your kids) is a feature rather than bug to her", "NTA\n\nDoes she often have grass is greener syndrome? That's going to become a bigger and bigger problem down the line.\n\nAlso, she needs new friends. I don't care if they're wealthier, they're jerks if they were crapping all over her vacation.\n\nI would warn her now that she better get an attitude adjustment because if she ruins this for everyone else, she's staying home.", "Shorter cruise...is she mad. NTA", "NTA, she can work for and plan the next trip too!", "NTA. Costs more for less.", "Changing the trip makes absolutely no sense, she\u2019s trying to live above her means and prove something to her friends. If she feels like she has to impress these friends are they even really her friends. Nta", "NTA.  I\u2019m pretty wealthy, but used to be the opposite- over the years we\u2019ve spent more and more on cruises- the only thing worth spending more on is a balcony and a cruise company with good food.  The only cruise worth spending extra in for the kids is Disney. The rest is all diminishing returns.  The bigger ships are also more crowded and take longer to disembark- 4000 plus ships are a nightmare.", "She\u2019s a grown adult! She should already know how to save", "Yup, every family event, my sister expects everyone else to watch her kids. I ran out into the road to save her kid that suddenly decided to dart, and thankfully the driver was being cautious, and she had the nerve to be shocked that I went off on her instead of my 2 year old niece. She's not only late to every event but over stays her welcome, and some things have now become \"kid free\" solely because of her. If a TV is on, one kid could be murdering the other, and she wouldn't notice.", "NTA. Why not just tell her since this trip is already planned and paid for to just go and have a great time and then think about trying the other cruise line another time.", "From what I know of cruises they don't transfer bookings like that. We had a cruise booked but one of us were going to be stuck overseas. We tried to transfer the booking to another person but apparently they could only do a cancellation and rebooking. If OP has everything booked and wants to transfer to an whole other cruise, that's going to be a hefty cancellation fee, nevermind the higher costs of the other cruise.", "This makes me sad, as I have two friends who are a married couple, going through the same thing right now.\n\nShe is constantly trying to keep up with the Joneses, and I can tell it\u2019s exhausting him. Pretty sure they\u2019re gonna get divorced within the next couple of years.\n\nNTA.", "She\u2019s being extremely unreasonable. NTA.", "NTA", "yeah, I can't run around on the whole vacation even though that means some time doing some of the same things I'd do at home.", "NTA I would have loved it if my ex had planned any time away for us. It\u2019s an act of love and shows you care.", "NTA I would just let her make all the changes, just put her in charge of it and she will quickly figure out that she is the AHole. She won\u2019t admit it, but she won\u2019t make the same mistake again"]}
