Since that time, I have paid off the cruise, scheduled/paid-for a number of upgrades (tours, drink packages, etc.), flights from our home city, hotel arrangements so we can tour the port city, airport parking, etc. I have also made arrangements with family in the port city to visit with them for a few days before our sailing date. My wife on the other hand has been watching cruise videos on YouTube, as well as talked to friends that are in a much higher income bracket than we are and decided the ship we are sailing on is too small (it\u2019s the smallest ship in this particular line\u2019s fleet). She has been on one cruise in her life on a similarly sized ship and had a good time but apparently this one does not have enough activities to keep our kids out of her hair (it has a kids club, arcade, and pool, etc. but what do I know). She has looked online for other cruises and found one on the same line that is leaving the same port a day earlier and is three days shorter that she likes better. She has asked (it feels more like a demand) that I call the cruise company and change over to this trip, then change everything else associated with it (flights, car rental, hotels, time with family \u2013 which will now be a day less, etc.). I looked at just the base cost of the new cruise on the bigger ship and it would cost us significantly more (new shorter cruise = old longer cruise with all of the tours and add-ons added on). I already think our budget is being stretched by this trip as it is presently scheduled. My answer was and continues to be a very firm \u201cno\u201d. She is now upset with me and thinks I am being unreasonable (code for A-hole).", "created_utc": 1681646452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o66pi/aita_for_not_drastically_changing_our_family/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This feels like it has less to do with the activities for your children and more like she\u2019s clout chasing and trying to keep up with her wealthier friends. She doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate any of your effort. If this trip isn\u2019t good enough for her, I\u2019d offer to cancel the entire thing.", "NTA she sounds like a spoiled brat and it sounds like her \"friends\" convinced her that she should do more expensive things that she cannot actually afford. Keep saying no, and remind her that if she wants to go on an expensive trip like her friends then they can pay for it instead of you.", "NTA\n\nExplain how much these changes would cost.  Let your wife plan the next vacation.", "Unless you purchased a refundable cruise fare it likely can't be changed or if so with lots of fees.  I'd call for your options and when they tell you no let it be the cruise lines \"fault\" you can't change.", "NTA - it sounds like you put in a lot of time and effort into planning out the vacation so if anyone is unreasonable, it\u2019s your wife. \n\nI also just can\u2019t comprehend how she thinks that her suggestion is the better way to go considering the changes, the budgeting, etc. \n\nI guess my only question is, did you and your wife look at both options side by side to see the pros and cons of each?", "Info. Did your wife agree to the original purchase and all of the tours and family meetup things or did you do it without her involvement?", "She is the asshole, being able to even go on any cruise is a huge success that not many people in the world will ever be able to experience", "NTA and a couple of this i would like to add. 1) unless you got refundable tickets for cruise / airplane, you are not going to be able to change them without losing a ton of money. 2) Cruise lines use they smaller ships for Alaska cruise because biggest ones won't be able to dock in most of the ports, so even the one she found might be bigger, it won't be like a huge difference in classes. Also, Alaska is so beautiful that if the kids are \"bored\" take them to the top deck and look at those mountains!. Alaska is beautiful beyond words / pictures. I am confident you all will have a great time with the right mindset", "NTA. I doubt everything you paid is refundable. \n\nTell her she can plan the next one.", "NTA. Explain that you can't just call and change everything and get full value for what you paid. There will be change fees and you'll likely end up paying far more in addition to the fare differences. Suggest that next time you go on vacation, your wife plan the vacation, within a certain budget.", "NTA big time. Sounds you have planned a great trip and I know how much work one have to put into this. \n\nPersonally I have a hard time with people snobbing up - I always go for longer, not so luxiorious trips  - The people you meet are often funnier, down to earth and who doesn't want to be away for a longer time. \n\nI would tell her she can plan, book and budget the next trip, but this one is perfect timed and arranged as it is.", "NTA.  She's changing everything and inconveniencing the week whole trip just because she wants presumably to have a much expensive trip just like her friends. \n\nShe is selfish by doing this.  If she so wants the other trip I guess she better go by herself. \n\nOr let her take all he responsibilities you have been doing and let her rebook everything. Let her shoulder the extra cost herself and plan everything. \n\nP. S seriously Op your wife is acting ridiculous and vain", "NTA,\n\nYou have fully paid off a trip which leaves a day later than the more expensive one so you spend more time with your family in the port town, your wife (I assume) didn't help with planning the cruise as they would've known about the activities for kids and you said you stretched your budget already on the cruise and all of the excursions and add ons. It doesn't matter about the size of the cruise when you have paid one off and planned it for months.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants a different cruise she can pay the difference.", "Was your wife involved in the planning?", "NTA\n\nHowever, before booking ANYTHING on the next vacation, make sure she is just as happy as you. \n\nAlso, make sure while on this cruise that she doesn't even have to see the kids for more than she wants to (meaning you take charge of any care that needs to be done outside kid's club)... \n\nAll this is under the idea that she didn't have input in THIS vacation from the start. If she had input and was happy up until she learned of something better and now she wants to change plans  ignore the other 2 paragraphs and enjoy your vacation.", "NTA But only because she\u2019s demanding changes you can\u2019t afford. \n\nHowever YTA if this trip was planned by you without seeking input from her as you did it. That\u2019s not a family vacation. That\u2019s your vacation that you\u2019re taking them along on. \n\nPerhaps she prefers the bigger boat with fewer add ons. You two need to agree on a budget and decide together the details on how to spend it.", "Depends entirely on how much input or agreement she had on the initial holiday. If she was fully part of the planning and agreed to it all, she's TA. If you just booked it after minimal or no discussion because you found a deal, then you'd be TA.", "NAH because\u2026 \n\n1/obviously in your telling you have a wonderful trip planned and are NTA. It sounds great.\n\n2/sometimes one person\u2019s idea of a perfect vacation is, for the other person, moving daily life to another location, with added complications.

I\u2019m not saying give in, but be intentional about her having a vacation too.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but apparently this one does not have enough activities to keep our kids out of her hair\" ..

Alaska is fantastic and your wife should not cut your time there short for a bigger ship. Frankly, I can\u2019t stand big ships.
