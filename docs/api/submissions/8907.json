Your request was reasonble, and her reaction was terrible. Parents who neglect their young children \u2014 physically or emotionally \u2014 often continue that neglect when their children are adults. It seems she's also extending it to your daughter. \n\nI'm sorry your mother continues to traumatized you, but I think it was an important and powerful step for you to speak the truth to her. And you did it in an emotionally mature way. Kudos to you for that! If she doesn't care enough to spend an hour with her grandchild to provide you an hour for yourself, perhaps she doesn't deserve the option in the future.", "ESH \u2026 your mom is an emotionally triggered person, and totally in the wrong.

But people trying to make themselves look good while being awful is entertaining to me so I watch like a train wreck. And my dad proceeds to beat me with jumper cables, lol.\n\nSo, first your request was reasonable, the response was typical raisedbynarcissist drivel about how good you have it by comparison. You clapped back in a way that wasn\u2019t exactly appropriate, but you were hurt and angry by the implication that you were a worse mother than your own emotionally unavailable mother.  This is a very human response, don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.\n\nHonestly go no contact as you\u2019ll be better for it. You don\u2019t have any support anyway so do yourself this favor. \n\nI assume that the stuff from your 20s was either an assault you\u2019re dealing with, or an abusive relationship that went on for too long. Good luck, have suffered childhood trauma in similar form. Not easy, therapy helps but unfortunately no cure.\n\nNTA, you got insulted in a sore spot and clapped back against someone who should have been better for you.

My MIL says the same thing; \"we didn't get a break when you were young\", but that has no relevance to today. Honestly, you could have gone a lot further than what you said, and I would still say NTA.

Yeah, your Mom was an arse. No doubt.  I'm guessing that she sees your therapy as being an insult to her parenting, so I'm thinking that you pushed a major button asking her to babysit while you (in her mind) talk about how awful she is.  And you should have just hung up. She is allowed to say no.  It is her right. And laying your own guilt trip on her, especially in these circumstances, doesn't look good on you.\n\nI understand how important therapy is. I honestly get it.  I bless my own for helping me become who I choose to be, rather than being controlled by other stuff.  \n\nAnd in laying into your mother, you wound up feeling badly about yourself. Your Dad is mad, and the other side of the coin is that you stood up for yourself ... you are conflicted enough to ask Reddit.  So it wasn't a healthy thing for you to do.  And you question how you expressed yourself, which beats on your self-esteem.\n\nI stood up for myself. In a number of ways. In measured, careful ways, that didn't burst forth at a stressful moment.  I was proactive about it, not reactive.  It was mature and thought out.  I do it regularly, now, and feel awesome about it. It helps my self-esteem.  \n\nThe next time you stand up for yourself, please let it be controlled and proactive.  I honestly want you to feel really good about it. I promise that it's amazing.  It frees you.  You honestly feel freedom.", "YTA if you leave your kid with someone who doesn\u2019t want to watch her.  That\u2019s not fair to your kid.  Find a babysitter.

That being said, she is not obligated to watch your kid just because she is your mom. You are not entitled to free childcare.", "ESH. Your parents are not built in babysitters. you are not entitled to have them watch your kid EVER.\n\nAnd before you go arguing with me, I have a nearly 1 year old.

That doesn't mean anyone in my or my husband's family is required to be at our beck and call", "Soft YTA but only because you went and poked the bear to hurt yourself. Please, please stay in therapy, and I really hope you can find other childcare solutions. Never ask her again. Stand up for Marley by not leaving her with someone so hurtful. And stand up for the little girl version of yourself. Let the Adult You make the decision to protect the Child You, and to protect Marley.\n\nLook up Patrick Teahan, a therapist who is on Youtube and Instagram. <3\n\nI made this about you, about whether you were an a-hole to yourself, because I don't give a damn about your Mom's feelings. <3 When I say \"soft YTA\" to yourself I only mean that you are on a journey and you WILL get there. I'm sorry for all the little girls who had to grow up and figure out who their mother really was. I'm in that group, too. It helps to start to get mad at her, and get some distance while you keep working on your peace and safety.\n\nEdit: I just saw your update about a telehealth option and naptime!!! I am so happy to read that!", "ESH, your mom for giving a guilt-trip instead of just telling you she couldn\u2019t watch your daughter, and you for thinking she owes you free childcare.

Why do you want your mother, who has not - and will never be able to - provide family with positive emotional connection and comfort,  in your daughter\u2019s life as a figure of influence? She is not treating your daughter any differently than she was treating you as a child. Do you want your daughter to learn that that behavior is acceptable and start internalizing guilt? Probably not. I suggest you establish a relationship with a nanny for situations like that. Check out \u201cAdult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d book while you are at it.

It helps!", "NTA\n\n\nBut just my 2 cents\n\nYour mother doesn't stop your father from speaking his mind.\n\nHe's a 63 y-o adult, old enough to speak his mind, he just doesn't want to", "NTA.", "NTA, and telemed is wonderful. Good for you for finding that answer.", "Heads up to everyone blaming the OP for \"stooping to her mom's level\" (LOL) when triggered: That is actually how that usually works. Most people with trauma don't handle being triggered gracefully, especially when already in a panicked state. OP is a human being who reacts emotionally when emotional, which is not the same thing as being an AH. Christ. \n\nNTA OP, but a lot of people in this thread are, so please ignore them, and I actually think you were quite eloquent and wise for being so upset. Your mom telling you to \"buck up and shut up\" in those exact words is far ruder than what you said, imo.\n\nBeyond the judgment, I do have a request for INFO: Why did your dad say your mom was \"triggered\"? How exactly did anything you said relate to any undisclosed trauma your mom has suffered? Because with the information I have, it looks like she just got mad that you called her out for not being the paragon of maternal know-how she was trying to project in that moment.", "my father was an asshole dad, but I watched him be very loving and playful with my nieces and nephews. \n\nI think it is more ESH because don't ask the person you need therapy to recover from to do you a favor so you can go to therapy.

She wasn't arguing with a view to changing her mom's answer; her mom said something hurtful, triggering, unnecessary and uncalled for, and OP (rightfully) got upset and stood up for herself. It wasn't about the damn babysitting anymore. NTA", "Everyone seems to jump on this bandwagon.  OP is not expecting childcare.  She ASKED.   She didn't argue after about thr mother refusing childcare, it was the way she said no.  \n\nYou are saying then you would never even ask you or your husband's family for childcare?  I mean, here is the medal you obviously want for not have any expectations for childcare (especially with a nearly 1 year old (!), but you are not certainly alone in having no expectations.", "Bro... What??????? Your reading comprehension is failing you.\n\nOP stated that her mom is a bad parent **because she was/is emotionally neglectful**. Her reaction wasn't about her mom saying 'no,' it was about her mom **attacking and belittling HER over a totally mundane request.** You can sit there and judge all you want, but most people would rise to the bait at that moment. That wouldn't make them an asshole, just as it doesn't make OP one - just a human being with flaws and feelings. NTA", "What does she need to do before she can ask her own mother for a small favor? Sounds like you have a very transactional view of relationships", "Every single E S H also counts.

We are allowed to have our own lives after our kids are grown. How will you feel if your daughter tells you someday that your sacrifices werent good enough?\n\nGotta say, this sounds like projection on your part. If OP needs therapy to help heal from her mom's lack of emotional support, then her sacrifices WEREN'T good enough, in point of fact. Why should the mom's hurt feelings get top billing over that? And why shouldn't the OP be given leeway when she's triggered by her mom disparaging her own parenting, right here and now? \n\nPersonally, I'm wondering why her dad said mom was \"triggered.\" What trauma does her mom have that they all seem to feel she's entitled to the term, and what does it have to do with OP and what she said?", "So much projection.  Therepy may help you with that.", "And you should know that growing up with a narcissistic parent is deeply traumatizing, and traumatized people don't always handle being triggered as gracefully as they would like to.

Your baby will likely eventually receive the same treatment by these assholes that you received, and didn\u2019t deserve.

If that woman traumatised you, she will traumatise your child.", "NTA\n\nYour mom was triggered because that\u2019s her trauma.

When I was younger, my father put me in therapy and my mother would make fun of me for being in therapy for her abuse (i was 12). Instead of hugging me and trying to help her only daughter, she ridiculed me.\n\nWhen I stopped going to therapy because I was embarrassed because my mother made fun of, I started writing in a diary that she would steel and read and then beat me up for what I wrote. Eventually my dad got custody when I was 16 and I started doing better emotionally.\n\nYou didn't go through this (I hope), but you still experienced neglect, which is abuse in my opinion.

That's not a concern when babysitting for an hour. It's something that becomes a concern when it goes on for months or years.\n\nThere are traits which are an issue when babysitting for an hour, but there is no indication in this post that the mother has those."]}
