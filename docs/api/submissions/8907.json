It seems she's also extending it to your daughter. \n\nI'm sorry your mother continues to traumatized you, but I think it was an important and powerful step for you to speak the truth to her. And you did it in an emotionally mature way. Kudos to you for that! If she doesn't care enough to spend an hour with her grandchild to provide you an hour for yourself, perhaps she doesn't deserve the option in the future.", "ESH \u2026 your mom is an emotionally triggered person, and totally in the wrong.

And my dad proceeds to beat me with jumper cables, lol.\n\nSo, first your request was reasonable, the response was typical raisedbynarcissist drivel about how good you have it by comparison. You clapped back in a way that wasn\u2019t exactly appropriate, but you were hurt and angry by the implication that you were a worse mother than your own emotionally unavailable mother.  This is a very human response, don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.\n\nHonestly go no contact as you\u2019ll be better for it. You don\u2019t have any support anyway so do yourself this favor. \n\nI assume that the stuff from your 20s was either an assault you\u2019re dealing with, or an abusive relationship that went on for too long. Good luck, have suffered childhood trauma in similar form.

My MIL says the same thing; \"we didn't get a break when you were young\", but that has no relevance to today. Honestly, you could have gone a lot further than what you said, and I would still say NTA.

Yeah, your Mom was an arse. No doubt.

And you should have just hung up. She is allowed to say no.  It is her right. And laying your own guilt trip on her, especially in these circumstances, doesn't look good on you.\n\nI understand how important therapy is. I honestly get it.  I bless my own for helping me become who I choose to be, rather than being controlled by other stuff.  \n\nAnd in laying into your mother, you wound up feeling badly about yourself. Your Dad is mad, and the other side of the coin is that you stood up for yourself ... you are conflicted enough to ask Reddit.  So it wasn't a healthy thing for you to do.  And you question how you expressed yourself, which beats on your self-esteem.\n\nI stood up for myself. In a number of ways. In measured, careful ways, that didn't burst forth at a stressful moment.  I was proactive about it, not reactive.  It was mature and thought out.  I do it regularly, now, and feel awesome about it. It helps my self-esteem.  \n\nThe next time you stand up for yourself, please let it be controlled and proactive.  I honestly want you to feel really good about it. I promise that it's amazing.  It frees you.  You honestly feel freedom.", "YTA if you leave your kid with someone who doesn\u2019t want to watch her.  That\u2019s not fair to your kid.  Find a babysitter.

That being said, she is not obligated to watch your kid just because she is your mom. You are not entitled to free childcare.", "ESH. Your parents are not built in babysitters. you are not entitled to have them watch your kid EVER.\n\nAnd before you go arguing with me, I have a nearly 1 year old.

And stand up for the little girl version of yourself. Let the Adult You make the decision to protect the Child You, and to protect Marley.\n\nLook up Patrick Teahan, a therapist who is on Youtube and Instagram. <3\n\nI made this about you, about whether you were an a-hole to yourself, because I don't give a damn about your Mom's feelings. <3 When I say \"soft YTA\" to yourself I only mean that you are on a journey and you WILL get there. I'm sorry for all the little girls who had to grow up and figure out who their mother really was. I'm in that group, too. It helps to start to get mad at her, and get some distance while you keep working on your peace and safety.\n\nEdit: I just saw your update about a telehealth option and naptime!!! I am so happy to read that!", "ESH, your mom for giving a guilt-trip instead of just telling you she couldn\u2019t watch your daughter, and you for thinking she owes you free childcare.

Why do you want your mother, who has not - and will never be able to - provide family with positive emotional connection and comfort,  in your daughter\u2019s life as a figure of influence? She is not treating your daughter any differently than she was treating you as a child. Do you want your daughter to learn that that behavior is acceptable and start internalizing guilt? Probably not. I suggest you establish a relationship with a nanny for situations like that. Check out \u201cAdult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d book while you are at it.
