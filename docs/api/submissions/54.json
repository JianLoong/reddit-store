It was a zebra highlighter and pen set. My girlfriend said that she had checked her local Tesco's and couldn't find them and she was really sad about it.

Her birthday was last week so she assumed I had bought them for her then, but when I gave her a different gift, she asked me about the highlighters. I told her they were for my girlfriend, and she asked if she could have them. I said no.

Or your parents will to hand them over. Once you've sent the package there's nothing much other than complain, or ground you (which would look ridiculous on their end to people.)they can do about it.", "\u201cMum, dad, you\u2019re right - it wouldn\u2019t have made sense for the set just to sit around unused. Thanks for inspiring me to make it an early \u2018just because\u2019 gift.\u201d", "Good plan. I'm sure your gf will be thrilled to get a surprise in the mail.", "send 'em as a guy fawkes gift because you're \"blowing up\" your sister's (and family's!) entitlement!", "Smart.

It sort of spoils the gift to give it over a month early and not to be able to see her response", "If I were you, I would just send it to your girlfriend, addressed to her, and let her open it now. Screw christmas.", "Dont tell them, Hang a photo on your wall with your gf having the pens. \nAnd for sure not the AH.

They deserve a bit of self inflicted torture for being AH", "This is such an excellent piece.", "Let them keep looking. Definitely don\u2019t text or discuss the highlights with your friend, they may search your phone or eavesdrop. I would drop \u201caccidental hints\u201d to keep them circling personally.

Having someone shake down your room like you are in a prison hiding contraband is ridiculous.\n\nIf they rabbit on about these zebra pens - say I got you a nice gift, you didn't appreciate it.  You wanted a gift I'd bought and I've now sent to my girlfriend.
