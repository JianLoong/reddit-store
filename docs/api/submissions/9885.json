That being said, you are NTA for correctly pointing out that your son prefers to read visually with large text. Braille literacy has been in decline for quite some time now, and one of the main arguments against text-to-speech, audiobooks, etc. for blind children is that relying on audio effectively leaves them illiterate.

However, it is her job as an advocate to communicate those reasons to you. Just saying you're not raising him to be independent is not doing her job correctly. Instead she should have given you real information on the need for braille. Maybe something like \"You'll want to improve his braille skills, as some scholarships focus on this.\"  I also think it's pretty sketchy that she said he was being \"forced to use materials for sighted people.\" Large print books are not for sighted people. They are specifically for visually impaired people. And even if they weren't....so what? If he likes it and it works well for him, that's what matters. \n\nI'm going with NTA instead of E S H because she didn't do her job properly. If she's not doing her job properly, I don't feel it's totally on you to give a proper response. However, as a parent, I think instead of immediately jumping to \"f you,\" the better thing to do would be to ask \"why.\" Why does she think learning braille is required for independence?

If you push a child that doesn\u2019t want to learn Braille too much, then it tends to sour the relationship between student and the teacher of the visually impaired. \nSome people will say \u201ckids don\u2019t want to you have to push them\u201d but that doesn\u2019t necessarily work in this kind of scenario. As long as there is a routine check-in, grades aren\u2019t slipping, etc, then meet your son where he\u2019s at and that is large print.", "NTA sounds like the blind advocate has a blindspot", "You were fine.\n\nShe's an AH.\n\nWhy should he go to trouble of mastering braille when he has his own way of reading that our modern tech life has provided for us?", "I would reach out to the school/organization she belongs to and tell them what happened.\n\nGood for you for speaking up. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Also if you\u2019re interested, you can download this free app called Libby where you just need a public library card and can rent free audiobooks through your local library. It\u2019s awesome. I highly recommend it!", "I am the mother of a blind 37 year old daughter. She is proficient in reading braille. I can tell you that she never uses it, even when she went to college. Everything is done electronically. There are many devices for blind people to use. Braille text books would be totally impractical. They would be massive in size.  You know what is best for your son, not someone else.", "NTA-this is like saying my deaf sister shouldn't wear her cochlear and should only ASL.  It's your son's choice.  My sister was forced to rely on her cochlear growing up instead of ASL concurrently.  It took living with me and being given a choice that forced her to become more independent.  She loves carrying a pad and paper when out and someone doesnt speak ASL while cochlear is for last resort.", "Takes two to tango. \n\nShe overreached a bit, you took it much too seriously as a personal attack.", "NTA\n\nThe \"advocate\" is not doing a very good job if she insists your son do something he's against.\n\nThey need to be reported to their parent agency if they have one.", ">  her questions about braille were very relevant and important for advocacy.\n\nThe questions about braille were relevant. The lecture was not.", ">Ignoring literacy skills because they're \"not interesting to him\" and \"it's a struggle to get him to practice\" is unacceptable as a parent.\n\nForcing something on a 14 year old. That's famously effective.\n\n>He's going to need braille\n\nYou actually do not know that. He may have poor, but stable eyesight. In fact, the OP himself verifies that his eyesight has been stable throughout his life.", "> She told me I'm not doing a good job of advocating for my son\n\nVirtually *nobody* is going to respond well to this kind of accusation. Even if it *were* true, if you're really advocating for the differently abled person, finding a positive way to communicate that to their caregiver is going to have a much greater impact than ensuring that parent no longer wants to listen to you.", "The lady should have said that he'd be required to know braille to qualify for other scholarships as opposed to just attacking OP.\n\nShe attempted to bring it back to the question and was continually berated at a support group. Fuck the speaker and fuck anyone who thinks OP should have 'handled it better'.", "Which is why I marked it ESH", "Not to mention that giving a holier-than-thou lecture only ensures that the person you think is doing a disservice to their child will no longer attend these meetings, further reducing their ability to work with their child.", "It varies from person to person. Sometimes a sense might boost itself, sometimes the person is just all the more at the mercy of their local disability codes. I've met a blind man who could echolocate to an extent. I've also met a blind woman who wishes she could daredevil herself around because it would involve less tripping.\n\nBut in a world with audiobooks, text-to-speech, and services that allow others to navigate the world as your eyes, is forcing a kid who doesn't want to learn braille the hill to die on? OP can keep tentatively trying to make sure he has the basics, but it's really up to him.\n\nYou can force a child to learn to read music and sit at a piano, but if they don't want to play then what can you do?", "That explains the part where you say he is the age where he hates everything anyway", "NTA.  Did you need to tell her to fuck off? Maybe, maybe not.  She did however need to be put in her place for going after you like that, which you did with extreme prejudice.  There are only two sets of people in this world that know what is best for your son and his vision issue; first your son and second you and your spouse (if applicable).  This random person doesn\u2019t know your son from Adam.", "She can fuck off and the rest of the group can fuck off also.", "NTA, granted I think this lady may have had a point and the both of you got side tracked but large print is more available now. Although, I don't know if your son's sight will be degenerative and braille may eventually be the only option. Hopefully not but she may have thought that. \n\n I've never known how available braille is for people. From my youth I remember it was sometimes on library audiobooks but not bookshop ones and sometimes on medicines you got at the pharmacy. Maybe very occasionally on a business sign but only on ones that also had Arabic or Urdu or whatever on it. I assume there are books in braille but I don't think there was a section at our local library. Granted I wasn't looking for one.", "NTA.  She probably didn't have useful information about scholarships and kept changing the subject in order to not look stupid or unqualified for what she is doing.", "NTA - Fewer than 10% of legally blind and blind North Americans read braille. The numbers have been decreasing over the past 20 years with advancements in technology. I know 11 blind and low vision doctors, lawyers, professors and engineers and not one of them reads braille. So not learning braille is not an impediment to a professional career/an education  It's an expensive communication medium, braille books are big/huge and it can take a long time to learn to read braille. I also know several people who used to read braille but can't due to loss of sensitivity in their fingers. Most stopped using braille before age 60, half by their early 50s."]}
