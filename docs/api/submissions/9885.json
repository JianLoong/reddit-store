Most ebook \nreading apps let you set font size, so large print is a lot more affordable than audio books or braille books, the difference between a couple of bucks and $50 or more. Because all of his schoolbooks and the books he reads for fun are ebooks, he hasn't had much reason to learn braille. We do encourage him to practice in case he needs it while out and about, but he's very resistant because he hates reading braille. But he's also at that age where he hates everything anyway.\n\nI go to support groups and am on a lot of message boards to keep up with news that is relevant to me and my kid. On Friday one of my groups had an education advocate come and talk to us. This is a topic that's very important to me because I keep track of scholarships my son is eligible for and was hoping she might know some obscure ones I haven't found yet. When it was my turn to ask a question, I asked about scholarships, and she asked for more information about my son.\n\nWhen I was telling her about my son, she asked how good his braille skills are, and I said they are poor because it doesn't interest him, and it's a struggle to get him to practice. She started lecturing me in front of everyone. She told me I'm not doing a good job of advocating for my son, and he's going to need braille and his lessons should all be in braille. I told her his schoolbooks aren't in braille because he can read large fonts, and she lectured me more and told me he shouldn't be forced to use materials for sighted people. I said he wasn't forced, that's what he prefers. I also asked if we could return to my original question, which was about scholarships, because that's what's most important to my family.\n\nShe said what was most important was my son having independence, and that I was preventing him from doing that. I felt very insulted. I told her to fuck off and not lecture me before walking a mile in my shoes. It's easy to tell parents they suck, but I'm doing my best. She was offended, and the group asked me to leave that meeting.\n\nThe general consensus is that I was oversensitive and an asshole, but I think she overstepped.

There are scholarships available for visually impaired/blind students that are tied to Braille literacy, such as through the Braille Group of Buffalo or the National Federation of the Blind. That being said, you are NTA for correctly pointing out that your son prefers to read visually with large text. Braille literacy has been in decline for quite some time now, and one of the main arguments against text-to-speech, audiobooks, etc. for blind children is that relying on audio effectively leaves them illiterate. But your son isn\u2019t illiterate, because he can still see and read. As long as his visual acuity isn\u2019t declining, you are absolutely in the right here.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI am legally blind, I am a wife and mother and at the age of 37 I can 100% not read braille. I am also very independent. Too be honest not knowing braille and teaching myself to read and figure things out has made me even more independent.\n\nI completely understand how your son prefers to read e-books in the bigger font, I do to. Being legally blind is complicated, it is hard to describe what I can and can't see, so it is best for us to figure it out on our own. Your son not wanting learn braille is in no way an indication of how independent he is or can be.\n\nYou are an amazing parent for respecting your son's wishes and planning for his future. You have every right to decline unsolicited advise. Also, I have an university degree, I did not do it in braille.\n\nAll the best, I just know your son has a bright future \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\udd8b", "NTA. I would have done the same thing, she was not there to lecture on how to raise your son, she was out of line and not professional at all.", "NTA- you asked a question and instead she acted awful. Disabled people can\u2019t win; either you are competent to make choices on your own or are a complete invalid.", "NTA. She had no right to insult your parenting after having only just met you and not having met your son at all. Using your question as an excuse to insult you especially in front of a group like that is not appropriate. Maybe the language you used wasn\u2019t the best choice especially if there were children in the room, but I understand why you used it. You weren\u2019t lashing out, you were defending yourself. Good for you", "NTA I don't understand why it is so important that he can read it like a pro. He reads like every other person his school books and he can do the same think in the university. The audacity of this woman. She should just have answered your question \n\nI'm blind on the right eye and my left eye isn't the best as well. But I don't have to use Braille and I hope everything will stay like it is now. \n\nYou do everything right. I wished my family would have been as supportive and well informed as you are. I didn't get much help and had for example do all kinds of sports in school even than it wasn't possible because I can't see in '3d'\n\nYou don't force your son to do anything.\nI hate than they want to make you more ill than you are. And how is he more dependent when he reads like he does now. As if Braille makes him independent. I actual think it makes him more dependent. Also if he can't read something because it's to tiny he can use some app or something to make the letters bigger. \n\nThis person was out of line. She could have said that you should keep helping your son to learn Braille. But nothing more. Just that sentence.\n\nYou do everything right. Fantastic\n\nSorry. I'm no native speaker.", "Your son has poor sight. Braille is a way of letting him read with his fingers. Large print is a way of letting him read with his eyes. He prefers large print. As long as his eyesight isn't going to get progressively worse, this is going to work for him. He can use a magnifier on normal print, and be able to access more information more easily than if he wanted braille.\n\nNot sure the woman had really thought this through.\n\nNTA", "NTA - she never answred your question, she was extremely rude and unhelpful and sometimes its absolutely best to tell someone to fuck off. Good for you.", "NTA, you give her a chance to talk about your son future and instead she decided to demean your parenting skills.", "I get this kind of unsolicited advice constantly. It's amazing how people always know how to deal with your situation better than you do from a single sentence. Never mind that it wasn't even the question at hand. I fully get your frustration with the situation. NTA", "NTA. He shouldn't be forced to use braille anymore than he should be \"forced\" to use material for sighted people. I don't understand how she thinks demanding someone do something in a specific way is \"advocating\" for them.  \n\nFWIW, my sister is legally blind as well. She regularly tells people like that to f*off for trying to control her. If he can read large text fine, he should feel free to read large text if that's what he wants. If he can read grade 1 braille ok, that's the most he'll need for his independence (it's occasionally useful for reading signs/elevator buttons).", "INFO - is there a risk that your son's vision will get worse in the future?", "NTA  She overstepped by lecturing you.  You still never had your question answered.  She should have also been asked to leave", "NTA- it is none of her business to judge. If your son wants to live his life that way- he SHOULD AND CAN. Her \u201che must be this way\u201d is BS", "NTA he is 24 not 7, you cant really force him to sit and practice can you?", "NTA. She's a shit advocate if she thinks that shaming someone is a good way to get them to see her point of view.", "NTA. Should it become necessary in your son's life, he will become more confident with Braille. But practically speaking, it is smart for him to continue reading on an ebook as long he can. He IS independent, since he can read large font (just like many older people, btw) and cell phones with handy cameras to blow up images exist. Education advocate was both unhelpful and combative since she didn't give you concrete reasons why Braille is so necessary at the moment besides \"because it should be.\"", "You were asking about scholarships, and she didn't give you any useful information AND dismissed assistive technology that your son prefers. NTA. Also, that support group definitely isn't serving your needs for both information and your journey... don't waste your time with them anymore.", "INFO: how old is your son?", "I'm going with generally NTA here with a soft YTA for the delivery of the needed message to said 'education' specialist.  You've got this, and your kid is going to be fine.", "NTA\n\nIt seems to me that the attitude of this woman and the group is problematic.  You told her your son prefers reading large font and she was stuck on him being \"forced\" to use materials for sighted people.  I am not an expert on blindness but know their are different levels.\n\nShouldn't they be focused on people having options that work for them instead of forcing people to use their own personal preferences of materials out there.  I think this person isn't an advocate as much as a power tripping A-hole.", "I'm going with a very soft ESH. She was absolutely out of line to lecture you about parenting your child. She doesn't live with your son and has NO right to tell you how to raise him. If she couldn't answer the question, she should have just said so and minded her business.\n\nWith that being said, you could have found a way to use your words in a more meaningful manner. Yes, some people just need to be told to fuck off but I think this was not that time or place.", "But was she really lecturing you, or was she telling you his life is gonna be easier if he would learn braille?\n\nI have the feeling you might have felt like being lectured while this maybe wasn't the case. But if course those are just assumptions.", "She didn't call you a shit mom, she told you that you where not preparing your child to live independently, and she was right. Your overreacting and putying wirds in her mouth, in addition to having a meltdown and cursunh her out indicates that deep down you know she is correct. Stop allowing your child to sabatoge his own education- everyone's eyes get worse as they age- he will need braille if he  currently needs large print. He should also be practicing with a cane before he needs one. His doctor has alresdy explained all of this. Don't act duprised or offended when you get honest feeed back- that makes it clear you are perfectly aware you are in the wrong.", "What she is mad about doesn't have any weight. She is trying to find a problem where there is none. As for him not wanting to learn braille all you can do is warn him about how eyesight can get worse and he will be wishing he learned it earlier. If you push it on him he will start to resent it. Sadly this is a lesson he wants to learn on his own. Just be there for him. That's all you can really do.", "You are totally NTA, but keeping your calm with annoying people will be a useful skill in the long run.
