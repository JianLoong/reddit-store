Don't give them access to your place. If they have a spare key, let them keep it and change your locks. NTA Keep it somewhere safe.", "You are right not to lend it to anyone. It's not a 'family ' heirloom it's YOUR NECKLACE, and grandma LEFT IT to YOU only. As such keep saying no and keep blocking permanently if necessary. \n\nOther people including so called family can be very generous with both your money, time and things as it doesn't AFFECT THEM.\n\nNTA", "Trust your instincts. They are not suddenly going to be nice to you.  They'll try to keep it.  Here's another way of thinking about it.  Would your beloved grandma want your sis to wear it?  You know the answer.  NTA.", "Everything else aside, your grandma would be rolling in her grave if she found out you gave it to her.", "Next time your family tries to guilt trip you, explode on them. Point out that what they are doing is *exactly* why grandma cut them out of the will, and she would be appalled that they didn't bother to change their behavior after she called them out on it.", "You should do just that. Seriously. They are not worth it and it would get a huge load of worry off your back. Ps, happy wedding.", "You should go no contact completely, they sound awful.", "Absolutely go no contact and don\u2019t let them near your wedding they\u2019ll spoil your day guaranteed", "Weddings and funerals are were people let the ugly out. I didn\u2019t invite my mother or sister to my wedding and it was the best decision I ever made. I spent a lot of money on my wedding and refused to have anyone there who didn\u2019t respect me as a human and treated me like shit my entire life.\n\nDon\u2019t invite people just because they are \u201cfamily\u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t let your sister or anyone even see the necklace because they will take it. It\u2019s not a \u201cfamily\u201d heirloom. It\u2019s a gift from your grandma to you.", "I respect your petty. \ud83e\udee1", "A cheap version that will fall apart as she goes in the aisle.", "This is the right plan.  Just be sure to try to act upset when they refuse to return the replica.", "YTA. Be the bigger person and do the right thing. It takes zero from you to allow her this thing. Would your grandmother have wanted her to wear it?", "NTA. She had the opportunity to be a decent human, she chose not to and grandma took notice. \n\nYour family sounds horrible, you\u2019d be perfectly reasonable to go NC with all of them.", "Nta.  It's yours.", "NTA. I'd remind the people badgering you that it was this exact behavior that got them disinherited in the first place.", "NTA.  My husband\u2019s grandmother died over two years ago and her children are still squabbling over inheritance.  Some people will pull some shady stuff to get their way when it comes to inherited items.", "Alright, the polite bit first: NTA\n\nNow the not-so-polite bit: Tell her to put her entitlement where the sun don't shine.", "NTA\n\nBut I have no idea no idea why you are even talking to any of these people, unless you're some kind of closeted masochist.", "NTA\n\nYou will likely never see it again", "Think about all the money you will save with all these awful family members you do t have to invite to your wedding anymore !!Obviously NTA !", "NTA. Just no reason at all you should let her use it, your grandma wouldn't like it either after all!", "NTA\n\nIf you loaned out that necklace you would NEVER see it again. Your sister would either keep it or \"accidentally\" break it. Alternately you could have a duplicate made of the necklace out of glass and loan her that (keeping the original safe somewhere). If she returns it then great. If she does not then you still have the original safe and know you did the right thing.", "Honor your grandma . Nothing else and nothing more . NTA", "NTA. You have no assurance you would get it back undamaged, if at all.", "NTA \n\nYour Grandmother said she couldn\u2019t rest if she gave her money. I doubt she would wanna you to give your sister her necklace. It\u2019s better to disappoint your bad family members than to disrespects your grandmother\u2019s memory.", "I was all ready to light into you for not letting the necklace be her something borrowed, but considering the backstory, NTA.\n\nIt sounds like she was absolutely horrible to you.  You owe her nothing.  If anyone cuts you off because of this, they're no loss.", "NTA.  Your grandmother left the necklace to YOU and no one else.  Tell your sister to kick rocks.", "NTA cut off contact with everyone! You're not going to see.that necklace again if you give in. She can go kick rocks.", "Why were you still in contact with these people in the first place. NTA.", "It's your to do with what you want.  \n\nA thought.... based on the family dynamics,  I am skeptical of you getting it back if you did loan it.  \n\nKeep it.  NTA", "NTA, I'm willing to bet money she would \"lose\" it or just never give it back. \n\nShe can deal with it. It was left to you for a reason.", "Your  grandma wrote it down. You have evidence. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour grandma appears to have clearly seen your sister and your family, as evidenced by their behaviour now. \n\nThat's why she did what she did.", "NTA, your grandma didn\u2019t leave her anything for a reason! She left the necklace to you and she has no right to get upset if you say no to her wearing it", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She said I could have it back\" - IF you lend it to her, you will NEVER get it back.", "NTA.  The necklace is not a family heirloom. It is your personal property to do what you wish with it.  After the way your sister has treated you, she has a lot of nerve to demand to wear the necklace.  She says you could have it back as though she was doing you some big favor. I wouldn't let her or any other family members anywhere near it, or it will be gone forever. In fact, I would put the necklace some place safe and  locked away any time they were in your house.", "NTA NTA NTA.  For the love of all that is holy DO NOT let her borrow this on her wedding day!!! She will steal it or 'loose' it or something else horrible. Your grandmother left it to you and it is now yours and yours alone. Share it with your children to keep it in your family. You sister and your parents lost any right to it by their treatment of you.", "NTA and keep the necklace out of reach of all family.", "NTA. She gave it to you because she knew you\u2019d cherish it. If you let your sister borrow it you will be ER get it back. Tell people that continued harassing you gets them a disinvite from your wedding. It sounds like you gave a lot of people you can go no contact with.", "Put it in a safe deposit box. If your sister is within 100 miles of it you\u2019ll never see it again.", "It is a family heirloom. It\u2019s YOUR family heirloom. If your grandmother wanted your sister to have access to it, she\u2019d have let you know that. Your sister\u2019s willingness to set your whole family against you shows let lack of maturity. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your family are all horrible people, so I don\u2019t think you should trust their judgment. Maybe you should ask yourself why they are in your life at this point? They seem fairly worthless. Your grandmother didn\u2019t think they were worthwhile people. Do you trust her judgment at least?", "I have the exact same feeling, she will NEVER see it again!", "If OP let's the sister \"borrow\" the necklace, dollars to donuts the necklace would go missing wedding day. Or should be left with sister cuz it's her wedding jewelry.", "Yes, and you should keep the necklace in a VERY secure location.", "Just to add, I recently read a post here where at a wedding they had the mother of the bride take off a very important necklace to leave wrapped around her boquet of flowers (didn't really understand why the bride wanted that) and they briefly lost the necklace which was made with the ashes of the deceased son!", "I\u2019m pretty sure you would never see that necklace again. Your family has repeatedly shown that they have no problem treating you poorly and will no doubt look for any excuse to keep it.  And as sad as it is to say, I\u2019d be willing to bet that they *still* wouldn\u2019t treat you nicely even if you had agreed. \n\nYour grandmother left it to you, she wanted you to have it. She very specifically did not want your sister to have it or wear it. Respect her wishes, respect yourself, and stand by your decision.", "Do not let her use it OP! You will regret it... it's YOUR grandma's gift, not hers, and yours to keep and yours to cherish. No one else.", "I agree with others saying not to invite this family.  They are not happy for you in any way shape or form and only people happy for you should be invited.  NTA.", "Omg I love the cheap replica idea. They don\u2019t need to know it\u2019s not real.", "Better than that, if that happens is a lesson learned that sis is pure evil! And let her think she got away with it ...and laugh and laugh and laugh for ever lol", "I like you. :)", "Or will turn her skin green."]}
