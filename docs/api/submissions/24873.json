Grandma knew what she was doing.  Honor grandma and enjoy your wedding.", "NTA\u2026you could let her borrow it just for the day of but honestly doesn\u2019t sound like she should be trusted with anything of value! Hope your wedding goes well and you can leave your family goodbye and start fresh with a healthy and happy life!", "NTA also, I can't understand Grandma. She wrote everyone else off, but not you. You weren't as dear to her as she made you think, it's a slap in the face nowadays to donate your assets if you have a family who TRULY cares for you. You and your fiancee cared for her and she just gives you a \"chunk\"? Generational wealth doesn't exist because of assholes like your grandma. That's my hot take.\n\nEdit: If she truly loved you, she'd have trusted you with all her assets, not just the \"minimum\". She used her wealth as a fucking weapon against her own family, wow. You wonder where your sister gets it from?", "NTA, it's not a family heirloom, it's YOURS.\n\nGo to the wedding, wear it, have a nice time.", "1000% NTA. The second you hand that necklace over, you will never see it again. \nI love the idea of making a cheap replica. I bet you could find a jewelry crafter who could make a convincing prop version. My bet is that sister is going to get it, decide last minute that it\u2019s not good enough, then \u2018lose it\u2019. She doesn\u2019t even want it, she just wants it from you. She might only be saying she wants it because you want to wear it on your wedding day. \nI\u2019d get a safe or a safety deposit box and get it insured, along with your new wedding bands. Let your insurance company know that the necklace is highly desired in your family, especially by your sister. Let them see your grandmother\u2019s letters, and that the necklace was left to you alone. So if something did happen, the insurance company has very detailed records to send to police and all area pawn shops. As well as who to talk to about it\u2019s disappearance.", "Your sister and family are only proving why grandma was so disgusted with them AND knew that they would never ever let you have anything nice in peace.\n\nThat's why she was clear about what she gave YOU, not the FAAAAMILY. That necklace was your grandma's; now it is yours. No. One. Else's.\n\nThis is where you learn to firmly stand up for yourself. Your grandma gifted you more than money and the necklace; she made it clear to YOU that their treatment of you is WRONG. That is a gift - a source of strength you let build inside your heart and soul and mind. So that you don't let your sister, your parents, or any other family take away your pride, your dignity, your possessions, your happiness ever again.\n\nKeep them at enough distance so that they don't invade your mind and peace.

Fill your life with him and with his family and with your friends or new friends. Good wishes to you.", "NTA.  Yours now, your choice what to do with it.  Tell them Grandma was right and you're not going to disrespect her wishes, and any complaints can be directed to (cemetery where she's buried, if there is one)  \n\n\nI also think it's highly likely if she got her hands on it you'd never see it again.

She had been the dumped on sister who took care of her parents until they passed.  She didn\u2019t want the workbench, but she didn\u2019t want them to have it.  As a result it was 30 years of bitterness.  My mother watched this dumpster fire and resolved to never fight over \u2018stuff\u2019 again.

Wrong lesson.", "NTA \n\nFirst off, I'm sadden to hear of your loss.\n\nYour grandmother said to wear it on your wedding day and everyday after that. Your wedding day is first. \n\nThose were her wishes. And if you were to ask yourself what would grandma do, you know your answer. Listen to the sage advice of the kind and loving grandmother you now keep in your heart. \n\nThey are all AH for trying to get you to go against her wishes. \n\nAnd don't even let your sister touch it.

I have a large, like almost 60 first cousins large family. I ahbe learned that ur family is the people who love and respect u. Not all of them r related to u by blood and that's OK. Thise that just share genetics but don't love and respect u and treat u well, those r relations. U share genetics with them and that's it. I feel this 100% applies to u.

I don\u2019t know if a local bank in your area still offers safe deposit box services, but it\u2019s worth looking into.

I get that you have a crappy relationship with her but why would you purposely keep something as special as getting to wear her grandma's necklace on her wedding day?

It doesn't cost you anything to lend out a piece of jewelry for ONE day.\n\n*Edited to add that if sister might not be trustworthy with the necklace then DON'T give it to her.
