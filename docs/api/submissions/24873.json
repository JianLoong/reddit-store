I can risk losing an object I love for someone that means a lot to me, but if the person asking for the object is an awful individual that only makes me miserable and only brings hate then I will give nothing. In OP case is evident that there is no relationship to keep so it's ok to refuse loaning the necklace.", "You are obviously NTA as the necklace is yours and you can do with it whatever you want.
