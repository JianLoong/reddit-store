For the high school yearbook, senior parents have an option to purchase an ad and personalize it with a message to their kid and photos. I have purchased the ad and I am working on personalizing it now. I notice that other kids mostly have both parents' signing the message (even some divorced parents). However, I have been the one to do all the work--keeping up with school academics, social events, lunch payments, etc. Her dad and I have been divorced for 3.5 years. WIBTA for not signing her dad to the ad as well?\n\nA little background: Her dad (56m) and I (50f) have been divorced for 3.5 years. During our 18-year marriage, I took care of the kids and worked from home in a job that allowed me to be home and actively parenting my daughters (the other daughter is 20f). I did all of the caretaking of the kids and the home. I planned meals, shopped for groceries, clothes, household needs, etc. I was a room parent, kept track of all the school events, signed kids up for extracurriculars, coordinated their transport to and from, made all the doctors/dentists/psychiatrist/psychologist/physical therapists appointments. When her dad and I divorced, I just wanted out and did not fight the low child support and no alimony settlement. I changed careers to one that I could make enough to fully support myself and the kids. I have asked their dad repeatedly to help more with all the school/doctor/dentist responsibilities and he still does nothing unless I explicitly ask him on a case-by-case basis. \n\nI asked him at the beginning of this school year to please pay attention to emails from the school bc it is senior year and there is a lot going on and to keep track of, and it will be an all-hands-on-deck situation. With so much going on, I feel we need all three of us paying attention and helping to make sure we don't miss deadlines, fees, events, etc. Just last week I had to remind him (for the second time) that we needed to pay for her AP and IB tests. He didn't respond to my texts or emails, but I took care of it anyway (while in Italy on my honeymoon with my new husband).\n\nWhile I want the ad to just be from me since I have done most of the work in raising her and especially lately with school, I wonder if that is an AH move bc it might hurt her feelings that her dad didn't have any part of it. I don't mind being an AH to my ex, but I want to avoid being an AH to my daughter.", "created_utc": 1699556761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rke48/wibta_for_signing_a_yearbook_ad_for_my_senior/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or would she simply see it as a gift from her mom? Maybe she would think it odd if he did sign because it's not the kind of thing he normally does. Is it common for you and her father to give joint gifts? Particularly substantial ones? She's going to have this yearbook for a very long time and may even someday show it to her own kids. \n\nYou can only base your judgement on the history between the three of you and what that would most likely lead her to expect.

If it's important for your daughter that her dad have an ad in the yearbook, I think she's old enough to ask him to do so.

If he wants to get one with his own name, that's up to him.", "Thank you, this gives me a lot to consider. I think both of my kids realize their dad is minimally if at all involved and she might even think it weird that we would both sign the ad/sign it together. She would probably suspect that I had taken the ad out and put his name on it. We do not give joint gifts and coparenting has been a nightmare with a few periods of cooperation and she is unfortunately aware of that.", "I have not messaged him specifically about this. He has access and receives all of the same emails and notices that I do. Usually I bring his attention to things but I'm just kinda over it now tbh. I've already paid for the ad.
