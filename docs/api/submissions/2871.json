It's your child and you are the person who can make the best decisions for your son as you know him the best.  \n\nTell MIL she can drive to visit him if she wants to see him and say you will not be cruel to her grandchild.   Stop answering her texts right away.", "You need to text her and include your husband with once again all the reasons you don't feel comfortable driving six hours with a three-year-old.  I know he is deployed but he can take a moment and put your MIL in her place.", "NTA. Is this six hours one way? Either way, if gram is so intent on seeing the little one for Xmas why can't she drive, hop a plane or take a bus your way? She knows her son's deployed. It'd be nice to join you & grandson for the holidays, but not force you to drove such a long distance. Hope it all works out.", "NTA. Tell her she is welcome to come see him so stop trying to to guilt you into a trip that is too much for both of you.", "NTA. \n\nYou're raising your kid alone for most of the year, she should go to you and help out instead of demanding you go out of your way to meet her demands \n\nAlso, taking a 3yo on a 6 hour road trip must be maddening", "NTA as a mom of a 2 year old, a 30 minute drive, let alone 6 hours can be a lot. Same as the above responses, if she wants to see her grandkid, she can come to you.", "NTA.\n\nOffer a 15 minute video chat with her the day before Christmas and tell her you won't be doing hours long travelling with the kiddo for christmas.  Simply say: \"That won't work for me.\"", "Nta. I know this would also be a nightmare but if she needs christmas so badly she can make the 6 hour trip on christmas to see you at your home for a bit. It is not your obligation to make a realtionship happen between your kids and grandparents, thats the grandparents job to make effort.", "NTA - Your concern over the 6 hour cartrip with a 3yo is VERY valid (imho - the waking up in his own bed is not so valid).  IF your objection is solely the long cartrip, tell Grandma that \n\n1- she can come to your house for Christmas, or\n\n2 - she can foot the bill for roundtrip airplane trip for both you and your son.\n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to drag you son to see his grandmother!

Any size drive around the holidays can be stressful in and of itself. Now make that drive 6 hours long and add a toddler to the mix? Yikes! I'm assuming your mother is closer. \n\nFor her to demand that you make that long trip and completely ignore your refusals, is a little crazy. Maybe, since she's not traveling with a toddler, she can make the trip to YOU guys for Christmas. If she's that hellbent on seeing him. I'm sure you're not keeping her from seeing him. She's probably not making much of an effort to travel the 6 hours to see him. But if she did, I'm sure you'd let her see him. haha.", "NTA. Mute her conversation and only look at it every few days so she can't bother you.", "NTA. I remember when I was that age and the 5 hour road trips to grandma were TERRIBLE for me. I was bored 99% of the time, was complaining, was whiny and needed to use the bathroom every half an hour. I hated it and I have no idea how dad managed to bear with me this long.\n\nDo not ever take a young child on such a long road trip.", "NTA, why can\u2019t she come to you?", "NTA six hours is too long a drive solo with a small child", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants to see her grandchild so badly she can travel to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry have to run now have a good day\u201d", "NTA\n\nA 6 hours travel alone with a toddler is a pure nightmare, not to mention it would be stressful and frustrating for your son.\n\nMIL can arrange with you a visit to your home.", "Nta a 3yo in the car for 6 hours one way? Yeah, I don't think so.", "NTA.  She can travel to OP (assuming she gets invited to) or OP can just simply tell her that all the harassing texts and religious zealotry make her feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable seeing her and exposing HER child to someone like that.", "NTA.\n\nShe can take a bus, plane, train whatever to come to your house.\n\nWhat does your husband think of it? (If he knows)", "NTA. Tell her to come to you.", "Block her, NTA", "NTA \n\nshe clearly has no idea how a 20min car ride with a toddler can go. You've answered her request so leave it at that. If she persists tell your husband next time he talks to his mom that he needs to snap her out of the delusion that you are coming.", "NTA. She can visit YOU if she wants to see your kid.", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.  No way I would drive 6 hours by myself with a 3-year old to see a woman who is clearly a pain in the butt.  If she wants to see her grandchild then she can figure out how to make the trip herself.", "NTA she\u2019s free to come and stay in a hotel near you want visit her grandson. Why should you have to drive her? If she has to see her grandson she can come to you.", "NTA \n\nYour MIL is being unreasonable. Pure and simple.", "NTA\n\nEither block her or ignore her.", "She doesn\u2019t drive", "BINGO, this is the best answer.", "Sounds like a her problem. Planes and busses exist.", "Well, then she doesn\u2019t get to decide how hard the trip would be on you, does she?", "That's fair. She doesn't drive, so she won't come to you.\n\nBut, of course, you don't drive either - well, at least not 6 hour drives. Nothing against her, you just don't do it. So by the exact same logic, it's fair that you won't go to her. \n\nShe can't have it both ways, and considering it's a bigger hassle for two people to travel away from their home than one, she can either find a way or stop complaining.", "As others have said.  Her not driving is NOT your problem.  If she really wants to see him, HAVE YOU HUSBAND TELL HER TO LEARN TO DRIVE.", "Then she could take a bus or train or plane if she wants to visit her grandson.\n\nPut her number of Do Not Disturb so you don't have to deal with her harassment for the next month.\n\nNTA", "They never do, do they?", "NTA - That is a perfectly reasonable decision. Just keep repeating \"I have already told you that we will not be coming for Christmas\" whenever she asks. No variation, no negotiating. \n\nAs for her accusations of keeping her grandchild from her - you do not owe her time with her grandchild. Just keep saying \"I am sorry you feel that way\". Again, no variation, no negotiating. \n\nShe is trying to wear you down to the point that you either do exactly what she wants or offer her something else just to appease her. But she is being unreasonable and it is not your job to make her happy about your decision. She has to accept it either way.", "NTA, but you made one mistake:\n\n> I told her no I can\u2019t handle a 6 hour card ride with a three year old alone and I also want him to wake up in his own bed on Christmas.\n\nThe correct answer is simply 'No.'  Why not?  Because you don't want to.  Period.  End of line.", "NTA. MIL is entitled, pushy, and demanding, and completely unconcerned about how her desires will impact you and your little one.\n\nI'd silence her texts and calls and start ignoring her. You've already told her that no, you're not traveling there. Her unwillingness to accept that does not in any way obligate you to keep telling her no over and over and over again.", "NTA.   She  can fly or take a bus.", "NTA she can use public transport to get to you if she is that fussed", "NTA. If she wants to see her grandchild on Christmas, she can travel.", "She\u2019s welcome to purchase plane tickets and a hotel room for a few days to either bring you guys to her or to go to you. Nta.", "Roads run both ways. Tell her she can come to you. If the drive isn't supposed to be an issue for you, why should it be an excuse for her?", "NTA. I would tell her if she doesn\u2019t stop you are going to block her.", "NTA. She's being very unreasonable and absolutely ridiculous about this. If it's this important, she should make arrangements to come see you and visit you and your child in your home. It's unrealistic to drive 6 hours with a toddler by yourself.", "NTA, if she wants to spend time with grandkids so badly, she can make the trip. Stick to your guns, no one can force you to drive that far with a toddler, it is not MIL decision.", "NTA but there are compromises available.\n\nDepending on your country, there may be other transit options- a flight, a bus, a train, etc. that your MIL can take to get to your house. I hesitate to say taxi or Uber because I imagine it would be exorbitantly expensive but possibly also those. \n\nAnother possible solution is to agree to meet somewhere in the middle for an early dinner/late lunch if there is a restaurant open. Perhaps there is a nice hotel somewhere along the way that has a restaurant that would be open on Christmas and you and your son can go on a Christmas Adventure to visit Grandma, or play Santa and bring Grandma presents, or something that aligns with your beliefs and appeases the child in the car. But I would cut the drive to 2-3 hours max and say \"I am not trying to deprive you of seeing your grandchild, but I know my son and he will not be able to handle a six hour car ride. His limit in the car is X hours. You are welcome to meet us somewhere that is X hours away so that neither of us has to make a 12 hour trip. Here are some options I've found that he will enjoy, which of these works for you and what time should we meet there?\"", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to do a six hour drive period. (And it\u2019s really 12 hours round trip - no.) \n\n> Now she is accusing me of keeping her grandchild from her.\n\n1. She isn\u2019t owed access\n2. She isn\u2019t owed access on her time\n3. She isn\u2019t owed access by demanding you drive 12 hours.\n\nShe can make arrangements to visit you.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s harrassing you. Why do people think that is going to work? It usually just pisses people off. But you did mention she\u2019s not the nicest person, so that tracks.\n\nShe also sounds awful for trying to act like she\u2019s the only grandparent.\n\nHer grandchild is your child first. Not wanting to put him through 12 hours in a car, and wanting him to be in his own bed *is completely reasonable*.\n\nNot wanting to be trapped in an extended visit with someone who is terrible is also reasonable.", "NTA.  Take it from another military spouse - lotsa deployments - when it comes to extended family, \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", "No, you need a buffer. Without your husband, no way. NTA. It\u2019s the life he chose.", "Ask her to send you a roundtrip air ticket - that should stop the nonsense.", "NTA I wouldn't even promote the narrative that it's because your son is so young, because at some point he won't be.  That simply isn't how you plan to spend your Christmas with your son, and that's totally fair.  I would likely threaten to block her if she doesn't back off.  You have no obligation to this woman and it is kind of you to try and keep her involved.  But you can certainly move to a system whereby all communication about your son will only be relayed to her by her son if she continues to try and bully you.", "NTA. Block her number.", "NTA easy answer you will come up she pays for the airplane tickets", "NTA. Tell her to get her ass on the bus and come to you", "NTA. I'm so glad our generation is getting better at holiday boundaries. We don't have to drag kids across the country on holidays. Why are the kids having their holidays disrupted for adults to sit around and complain about each other? If you want to see someone on a holiday, you need to make the effort to see them. Not demand they travel to you.", "NTA. She can kick rocks into sand, then pound the sand. This is why it would have been smart of her to be nice to you, so you could stand including her while hubs is deployed. Lmao", "NTA.  I drive 6 hours with an eight and four year old to see their grandparents several times a year alone or with hubby.  It is not for the faint of heart especially alone.  It takes nearly 10 hours of cleaning, packing, and trip planning to be able to dk with minimal stress.  Do you know the route, can you stop every few hours to let kid stretch legs, do they travel well?  Dont want to deal with any of that and be stressed for a holiday?  Then stay home and enjoy your kid.  Grandma can visit over a video call or get there herself if she is physically capable.", "NTA. 6 hours by myself, no problem but just imagining 6 hours driving with my 4 yr old makes me cringe.", "NTA. Little kids should wake up in their own beds on Xmas morning. Come down in PJs, open stockings and gifts, and play on their own house. MIL can stuff it.", "Nta", "NTA. If she wants effort, she needs to wait for her son to be available. What you do with your own family isn't related to her. Good for you not giving into unreasonable in law demands.", "This is the way, it's how I deal with my controlling ex. No, that doesn't work for us (and if you want to offer an alternative that does) and I'm sorry that's how you feel. \n\nShe's being ridiculous expecting the two of you to do all that travelling and as a parent I'm totally with you on having them at home for the holidays especially when they're young. There's so much going on and they end up hyper and tired even if you don't factor in travel", "They have trains, buses and planes. Tell her to pick one of those modes of transportation, and if she doesn\u2019t want to that, then she can have a tall glass of STUP. And tell her God don\u2019t like ugly, and right now her behavior isn\u2019t looking all that pretty", "Maybe she should fly then.", "Lmaooo sucks to be her. NTA", "lol then she should understand you don\u2019t drive either.", "Uber", "> Planes and busses exist.\n\nHa - I 've had to tell my mother that the planes and busses go both ways.  We do a thing where we try to spend every other year with family for vacation then the opposite years go somewhere fun (Disney, Hawaii, etc.).  The first year that we did this my mom was pissed that we weren't going to our home state.  I told her \"the planes work both ways you can come visit us.\"  At that point I had lived in another state for 10 years or so.  She hadn't been to my state once, now that I have lived here for 20 years, she still hasn't been here."]}
