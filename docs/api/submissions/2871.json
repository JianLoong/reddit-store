If she wants to see her grandchild so badly, she can drive down to you for Christmas. She sounds like the pushy type. Stand your ground.", "NTA, She can do the 6 hour drive if she's so desperate. I'd just stop answering her calls/texts to be honest.", "NTA and if it's such a big deal to MIL that she see your LO on Xmas then she can put her ass in a car, bus, plane and drive or fly to you.", "Tell MIL to take a bus to you", "NTA.  It's your child and you are the person who can make the best decisions for your son as you know him the best.  \n\nTell MIL she can drive to visit him if she wants to see him and say you will not be cruel to her grandchild.   Stop answering her texts right away.", "You need to text her and include your husband with once again all the reasons you don't feel comfortable driving six hours with a three-year-old.  I know he is deployed but he can take a moment and put your MIL in here place.", "NTA. Is this six hours one way? Either way, if gram is so intent on seeing the little one for Xmas why can't she drive, hop a plane or take a bus your way? She knows her son's deployed. It'd be nice to join you & grandson for the holidays, but not force you to drove such a long distance. Hope it all works out.", "NTA. Tell her she is welcome to come see him so stop trying to to guilt you into a trip that is too much for both of you.", "NTA. \n\nYou're raising your kid alone for most of the year, she should go to you and help out instead of demanding you go out of your way to meet her demands \n\nAlso, taking a 3yo on a 6 hour road trip must be maddening", "NTA as a mom of a 2 year old, a 30 minute drive, let alone 6 hours can be a lot. Same as the above responses, if she wants to see her grandkid, she can come to you.", "NTA.\n\nOffer a 15 minute video chat with her the day before Christmas and tell her you won't be doing hours long travelling with the kiddo for christmas.  Simply say: \"That won't work for me.\"", "Nta. I know this would also be a nightmare but if she needs christmas so badly she can make the 6 hour trip on christmas to see you at your home for a bit. It is not your obligation to make a realtionship happen between your kids and grandparents, thats the grandparents job to make effort.", "NTA - Your concern over the 6 hour cartrip with a 3yo is VERY valid (imho - the waking up in his own bed is not so valid).  IF your objection is solely the long cartrip, tell Grandma that \n\n1- she can come to your house for Christmas, or\n\n2 - she can foot the bill for roundtrip airplane trip for both you and your son.\n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to drag you son to see his grandmother!  If she wants to see him, have the 'mountain' come to 'Mohammed\".", "NTA\n\nClassic honey v. vinegar situation. Want to see your grandkids more? Be nicer in-laws.", "NTA. Any size drive around the holidays can be stressful in and of itself. Now make that drive 6 hours long and add a toddler to the mix? Yikes! I'm assuming your mother is closer. \n\nFor her to demand that you make that long trip and completely ignore your refusals, is a little crazy. Maybe, since she's not traveling with a toddler, she can make the trip to YOU guys for Christmas. If she's that hellbent on seeing him. I'm sure you're not keeping her from seeing him. She's probably not making much of an effort to travel the 6 hours to see him. But if she did, I'm sure you'd let her see him. haha.", "NTA. Mute her conversation and only look at it every few days so she can't bother you.", "NTA. I remember when I was that age and the 5 hour road trips to grandma were TERRIBLE for me. I was bored 99% of the time, was complaining, was whiny and needed to use the bathroom every half an hour. I hated it and I have no idea how dad managed to bear with me this long.\n\nDo not ever take a young child on such a long road trip.", "NTA, why can\u2019t she come to you?", "NTA six hours is too long a drive solo with a small child", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants to see her grandchild so badly she can travel to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yeah, I don't think so.", "NTA.  She can travel to OP (assuming she gets invited to) or OP can just simply tell her that all the harassing texts and religious zealotry make her feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable seeing her and exposing HER child to someone like that.", "NTA.\n\nShe can take a bus, plane, train whatever to come to your house.\n\nWhat does your husband think of it?

No is a complete sentence.  No way I would drive 6 hours by myself with a 3-year old to see a woman who is clearly a pain in the butt.

She doesn't drive, so she won't come to you.\n\nBut, of course, you don't drive either - well, at least not 6 hour drives. Nothing against her, you just don't do it. So by the exact same logic, it's fair that you won't go to her. \n\nShe can't have it both ways, and considering it's a bigger hassle for two people to travel away from their home than one, she can either find a way or stop complaining.", "As others have said.  Her not driving is NOT your problem.  If she really wants to see him, HAVE YOU HUSBAND TELL HER TO LEARN TO DRIVE.", "Then she could take a bus or train or plane if she wants to visit her grandson.\n\nPut her number of Do Not Disturb so you don't have to deal with her harassment for the next month.\n\nNTA", "They never do, do they?"]}
