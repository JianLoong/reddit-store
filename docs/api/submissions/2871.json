Maybe, since she's not traveling with a toddler, she can make the trip to YOU guys for Christmas. If she's that hellbent on seeing him. I'm sure you're not keeping her from seeing him.

No is a complete sentence.  No way I would drive 6 hours by myself with a 3-year old to see a woman who is clearly a pain in the butt.

She doesn't drive, so she won't come to you.\n\nBut, of course, you don't drive either - well, at least not 6 hour drives. Nothing against her, you just don't do it. So by the exact same logic, it's fair that you won't go to her. \n\nShe can't have it both ways, and considering it's a bigger hassle for two people to travel away from their home than one, she can either find a way or stop complaining.", "As others have said.

No variation, no negotiating. \n\nAs for her accusations of keeping her grandchild from her - you do not owe her time with her grandchild. Just keep saying \"I am sorry you feel that way\". Again, no variation, no negotiating. \n\nShe is trying to wear you down to the point that you either do exactly what she wants or offer her something else just to appease her. But she is being unreasonable and it is not your job to make her happy about your decision. She has to accept it either way.", "NTA, but you made one mistake:\n\n> I told her no I can\u2019t handle a 6 hour card ride with a three year old alone and I also want him to wake up in his own bed on Christmas.\n\nThe correct answer is simply 'No.'  Why not?  Because you don't want to.  Period.  End of line.", "NTA. MIL is entitled, pushy, and demanding, and completely unconcerned about how her desires will impact you and your little one.\n\nI'd silence her texts and calls and start ignoring her. You've already told her that no, you're not traveling there. Her unwillingness to accept that does not in any way obligate you to keep telling her no over and over and over again.", "NTA.   She  can fly or take a bus.", "NTA she can use public transport to get to you if she is that fussed", "NTA. If she wants to see her grandchild on Christmas, she can travel.", "She\u2019s welcome to purchase plane tickets and a hotel room for a few days to either bring you guys to her or to go to you.

I would tell her if she doesn\u2019t stop you are going to block her.", "NTA. She's being very unreasonable and absolutely ridiculous about this. If it's this important, she should make arrangements to come see you and visit you and your child in your home. It's unrealistic to drive 6 hours with a toddler by yourself.", "NTA, if she wants to spend time with grandkids so badly, she can make the trip. Stick to your guns, no one can force you to drive that far with a toddler, it is not MIL decision.", "NTA but there are compromises available.\n\nDepending on your country, there may be other transit options- a flight, a bus, a train, etc. that your MIL can take to get to your house. I hesitate to say taxi or Uber because I imagine it would be exorbitantly expensive but possibly also those. \n\nAnother possible solution is to agree to meet somewhere in the middle for an early dinner/late lunch if there is a restaurant open. Perhaps there is a nice hotel somewhere along the way that has a restaurant that would be open on Christmas and you and your son can go on a Christmas Adventure to visit Grandma, or play Santa and bring Grandma presents, or something that aligns with your beliefs and appeases the child in the car. But I would cut the drive to 2-3 hours max and say \"I am not trying to deprive you of seeing your grandchild, but I know my son and he will not be able to handle a six hour car ride. His limit in the car is X hours. You are welcome to meet us somewhere that is X hours away so that neither of us has to make a 12 hour trip.

(And it\u2019s really 12 hours round trip - no.) \n\n> Now she is accusing me of keeping her grandchild from her.\n\n1. She isn\u2019t owed access\n2. She isn\u2019t owed access on her time\n3. She isn\u2019t owed access by demanding you drive 12 hours.\n\nShe can make arrangements to visit you.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s harrassing you. Why do people think that is going to work? It usually just pisses people off. But you did mention she\u2019s not the nicest person, so that tracks.\n\nShe also sounds awful for trying to act like she\u2019s the only grandparent.\n\nHer grandchild is your child first. Not wanting to put him through 12 hours in a car, and wanting him to be in his own bed *is completely reasonable*.\n\nNot wanting to be trapped in an extended visit with someone who is terrible is also reasonable.", "NTA.  Take it from another military spouse - lotsa deployments - when it comes to extended family, \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", "No, you need a buffer. Without your husband, no way. NTA. It\u2019s the life he chose.", "Ask her to send you a roundtrip air ticket - that should stop the nonsense.", "NTA I wouldn't even promote the narrative that it's because your son is so young, because at some point he won't be.  That simply isn't how you plan to spend your Christmas with your son, and that's totally fair.  I would likely threaten to block her if she doesn't back off.  You have no obligation to this woman and it is kind of you to try and keep her involved.  But you can certainly move to a system whereby all communication about your son will only be relayed to her by her son if she continues to try and bully you.", "NTA.

I'm so glad our generation is getting better at holiday boundaries. We don't have to drag kids across the country on holidays.

This is why it would have been smart of her to be nice to you, so you could stand including her while hubs is deployed. Lmao", "NTA.  I drive 6 hours with an eight and four year old to see their grandparents several times a year alone or with hubby.  It is not for the faint of heart especially alone.  It takes nearly 10 hours of cleaning, packing, and trip planning to be able to dk with minimal stress.  Do you know the route, can you stop every few hours to let kid stretch legs, do they travel well?  Dont want to deal with any of that and be stressed for a holiday?  Then stay home and enjoy your kid.  Grandma can visit over a video call or get there herself if she is physically capable.", "NTA. 6 hours by myself, no problem but just imagining 6 hours driving with my 4 yr old makes me cringe.", "NTA.

Good for you not giving into unreasonable in law demands.", "This is the way, it's how I deal with my controlling ex. No, that doesn't work for us (and if you want to offer an alternative that does) and I'm sorry that's how you feel. \n\nShe's being ridiculous expecting the two of you to do all that travelling and as a parent I'm totally with you on having them at home for the holidays especially when they're young.

NTA", "lol then she should understand you don\u2019t drive either.", "Uber", "> Planes and busses exist.\n\nHa - I 've had to tell my mother that the planes and busses go both ways.  We do a thing where we try to spend every other year with family for vacation then the opposite years go somewhere fun (Disney, Hawaii, etc.).  The first year that we did this my mom was pissed that we weren't going to our home state.  I told her \"the planes work both ways you can come visit us.\"  At that point I had lived in another state for 10 years or so.  She hadn't been to my state once, now that I have lived here for 20 years, she still hasn't been here.", "NTA - No means no.  It's not a reasonable request to expect you to drive 6 hours with a toddler just so she can be mean to you.  Then you get to make the 6 hour drive back.  You have a right to enjoy the holiday, too.\n\nShe wants you to drive 12 hours to give you a hard time.  Hard pass.  If your husband doesn't back you here, you have a bigger problem because he should be sticking up for you, not enabling his mother's unreasonable demands and poor treatment of you.\n\nIf your MIL won't stop texting you, put her on a time out and enjoy the silence.", "Nta\n\nWhy can't she take a bus to you.
