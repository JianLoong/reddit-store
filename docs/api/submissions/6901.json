{"id": 6901, "submission_id": "107gbw9", "title": "AITA for refusing to pressure my grandfather to give my stepsister the family diamond?", "selftext": "Context - I am 25F, my parents have been divorced for 15 years, my dad has been married to his wife Laura for 10 years. Laura has two daughters, Katie (26F), and Sam (22F). My dad is very close to Katie and Sam and considers them to be daughters to him. The grandfather I am referring to is my dad's father.\n\nMy grandfather has a diamond that belonged to my great grandmother, and it's something of a family miracle, since my grandfather managed to find it after WWII. Unfortunately, he lost his mother and sister in the war, so he saved the diamond to be for the next woman in the family (to be set into an engagement ring). Now, my grandfather has a thing about blood and family, namely if you're not blood, you can be family, but you're not *in* the family (I am pretty sure this somewhat related to his trauma but it might be a generational thing). Because of this distinction, his sons were not allowed to use the diamond for their wives' rings because then the diamond would belong to the wife and the wife is not blood. I am his only biological granddaughter, so it was always presumed that the diamond would go to me.\n\nI got engaged last year, and I didn't end up using the diamond for the ring. The diamond was not the colour or cut of the style I wanted, and my grandfather knew that. He offered to have the diamond recut but I begged him not to because it is very valuable and I know how much it means to him, and he agreed that when I get married he will set it into a necklace to be worn on my wedding day instead. \n\nNow, Katie is going to get engaged soon. My dad is likely to be asked to walk her down the aisle. Laura asked that my grandfather give her the diamond for her ring, since she is basically my father's daughter. My grandfather said, and I quote, \"not even over my dead body\", and that the diamond will stay in the family. That said, Laura, my dad, and Katie are now extremely upset. My dad suggested maybe I could ask my grandfather to let them use the diamond, since I hadn't used it for a ring anyway, and that he considers Katie part of his family and will be forever, so it should be okay for her to have it, especially since she is older so the \"first\" woman as it were. My grandfather would probably relent if I asked him, but I said no because I would feel too guilty. That diamond is all my grandfather has left of a family he lost in the most horrific circumstances when he was 9 years old. They don't even have graves, that stone is literally all he has to remember them. What right do any us have to dictate what he does with it?\n\nKatie, Laura, and my dad have all been texting and calling about how hurt they are that I am letting my grandfather exclude Katie from the family, and that I already have a ring, why can't I just help my grandfather soften and let Laura and her kids be part of the family. I'm holding firm on it for now, but should I be?", "created_utc": 1673276061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gbw9/aita_for_refusing_to_pressure_my_grandfather_to/", "score": 7916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because Katie doesn't get a payout to become part of the family?  How about your dad respect his father's wishes?  His property, he can do with it whatever he wants, which is not give it to someone that is only in his family by marriage.  YOU are grandpa's family.  YOU get to carry on the tradition that is so important to him.   And your dad is totally awful for trying to manipulate you into manipulating your grandfather.  \n\nIt isn't your grandfather's job to make sure this childish woman feels welcome.  He has a great plan, by putting it in a necklace for you, his blood granddaughter.  Stand firm.  Don't get tied up in their schemes.  Your dad is sacrificing his integrity to get in good with his new wife.  And her daughter is totally entitled.  Next will be she \"deserves\" a different thing because she didn't get this.  \n\nThis is just golddigging with extra steps.  I am sorry your dad is not seeing it for what it is, but that is exactly what it is.", "NTA.  This is a very traumatic situation for your grandfather, and he clearly wants you to have something that is very sentimental and meaningful for him. It doesn't matter what the item is. It belongs to him, and he should be able to do what he wants with it. \n\nWould they be putting the same pressure on him if it was a glass bead or a photo? Of course not.  They want a big shiny rock,  and they don't want to pay for it.", "NTA. It\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s choice what to do with his heirloom.

If you\u2019ve accepted the offer of setting the diamond to be worn as a necklace on your wedding day, then it\u2019s been spoken for and a done deal. Not your problem if the others don\u2019t like it. Also, my bff has a right hand diamond ring that was her g-grandmother\u2019s engagement ring. I know the cut isn\u2019t you\u2019re preference for your engagement ring, but with respect to your grandfather\u2019s wishes, could you have it made into a right hand ring?", "NTA, your grandfather should get to decide. It is not your job to pressure anybody, especially if it's already basically agreed upon that he will have it put into a necklace for you. He feels the way that he feels, and no one is entitled to a diamond anyway.", "Nta, this is your grandfathers decision.  If they don't like it then THEY talk to him.   This doesnt really have anything to do with you. Frankly, that they are pressuring you to make him to what they want is a tad disgusting.", "NTA - There is only one diamond and there are three women that your dad considers to be daughters. Two of you were always going to be excluded from this tradition. Since the stone currently belongs to your grandfather, he gets to decide which of you gets it.

I think the rest of your family needs to respect that. It's not a slight to them to not get something of his, they're making an issue where there really doesn't need to be one.", "NTA.

Tell your grampa what your Dad and Stepmom are trying to do so he's aware.

Stand by him and his wishes.", "NTA. It's ultimately your grandfather's decision what he does with the diamond. It was probably intended to go to you even before your father remarried, and it's not fair of them to ask you to give it up \"because you already have a ring.\" That's not the point. It has serious sentimental value to your grandfather and to you, so it should go to you.", "NTA, you'll always have a different relationship with your grandparents than your step siblings. In your case it seems like your grandpa's been there from the start so in reality he'll see you different. The diamond is going into a necklace for you, so it's not like you're not using it. You'll really appreciate this gift from your grandpa in the future. Don't let them bully you out of it.", "NTA - hold firm. It\u2019s your grandfathers property and he has the right to give the diamond to whomever he chooses and shouldn\u2019t be harassed to do otherwise. He has decided to give the diamond to you as a necklace so it\u2019s not available anyways.  Your father if he chooses can start his own traditions.", "NTA. I agree that no one has a right to dictate what your grandfather does with the diamond. Even if I don't agree with his definition of \"family,\" it is his heirloom to decide what to do with. I think setting it into a necklace to be worn on your wedding day is a wonderful idea. If you happen to have a daughter some day, you could pass it on to her.", "Info: why on earth are you the one responsible for this? This is your father\u2019s father, why can\u2019t he ask his own dad rather than trying to guilt trip his daughter into doing it?", "NTA\n\nstand your ground.

It's incredibly unfair that your family is putting all this pressure on you when it is your grandfather's decision to make alone.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your grandpa\u2019s decision and his diamond. He needs to make a will or make sure that junk is in there, called out, and specifically given to somebody in the blood family.\n\nLaura, Katie, and your dad can be as mad as they want. Grandpa could easily set it in a row boat with his body and have the thing explode in the ocean (post death). It\u2019s his to do what he wants with.", "NTA.

I'm getting the idea that the diamond is just as important to you as it is to him.\nYour father pressuring you to ask him to give it away, knowing that he probably would, is so manipulative. It's not his place.", "Yes you should! Your grandfather owns the stone and he gets to decide who he gives it to. He's always been very clear about his 'rule' so I don't see why your dad is upset.

The story is what matters,  not the stone.  The story is meaningful to the heart & will last longer if it's maintained & nurtured there.   \n\nIf the stone is lost,  does the story survive?  Yes.   The stone is not the more meaningful element in this. \n\n  Grandfather was willing to alter the cut of the stone,  changing the stone to keep the story attached to this stone.   Better to leave the stone as it was,  maintain the story & allow the stone & the story to exist together OR independently.  More family members can tell the story without the stone,  keeping the story alive in the family.   The physical stone is not essential to keeping the story alive in the family. \n\nAnecdotal (true story):  When my mom passed away,  there was plenty of \"family jewels\" to be disturbing to the 3 children.   My moms engagement ring was designed with 4 beautiful diamonds set in a row across her finger.   The ring has a story that we all loved as one of those great,  fun stories to hear & tell. \n\nMy dad decided to break up the ring & have a diamond solitaire necklace made for each of us, leaving one diamond left over. With 2 grand daughters,  my dad was troubled with what to do with that 4th stone.  Can't give it to one & not the other,  right?   That stone belonged to my dad & we had fun coming up with creative things he could do with it.  Proposing various piercings was extra funzies for us...lol   The story lives on each time we tell it, even when not wearing a diamond from that ring.\n\nThe 4th diamond has been \"lost\" to our family now.   When my Dad passed away unexpectedly,  his widow told us the stone was no longer in his safe. The 3 of us have our story to tell.   She (widow) has a rather shady & ugly one attached to that 4th diamond now.  Whomever wears it will tell their own story about where it came from,  won't they.  \n\n Pssst... widow's grand daughter was wearing a diamond solitaire necklace,  eerily similar to ours,  when she totaled her car with both of them in it, just 6 months after my dad passed away.  They are both OK, but grand daughter will be without her license & vehicle to drive (lawfully)  for a good long while.  Karma will always circle around to deliver in kind what we put out for karma to feed on.  \n\nBonus karma:   Widow's Grand daughter was driving my dad's car,  a 1963 Austin Healy Sprite that he'd asked to be given to his eldest grandson who helped him rebuild/restore it.  That didn't happen & the car was destroyed in the accident.  Yes,  she kept the insurance pay out for the car & did not replace it with another.  VERY sad to lose the car.  It was the 1st car he bought for himself after Navy, college & first job helped him afford a car.   but... still have this story to tell about his Sprite &  karma related to NOT honoring someone's wishes when they die,   right?", "NTA.

This is to ensure that the jewelry stays within the family and doesn't get lost in a broken engagement or divorce. Example: a son may not get an engagement ring, but his daughter would. So it's not like the sons' side of the family would be left out. We've had step siblings that were raised in the family from a young age.

Donating it as an artifact it to a WWII or Holocaust museum or even a synagogue (if applicable) could be a possibility.

Survivors have told us this. They got them into the chambers under the guise of showers. It saved time to have them naked beforehand, we have the glasses, shoes, suitcases, etc to back this. The clothes were often reused due to poverty in Germany and even the soldiers used gassed peoples clothes, especially when fighting on the Eastern front versus the USSR. They didn't burn them with clothes on and all jewellery was long removed. So no, it wasn't removed from their ashes from the chambers and incinerators, they burnt too high especially for gold, it wouldn't stand up to science. Diamonds would survive, not gold. Also the incinerators worked at past capacity especially in the later part of the war. Finding a diamond in the literal tonnes of ash would be incredibly implausible.

She was going to give it to me, which was an honor, buti told her to keep it until she\u2019s older and ask again. but those two mean so much and if it was given to anyone else i wouldn\u2019t have cared. i have two cousins that are girls that are 16 and 14 now. from my aunt, my moms sister. and then my uncle just had a daughter 2 years ago and there\u2019s another uncle that hasn\u2019t had kids yet. all from my moms side. so i wouldn\u2019t care if it went to anyone else, but i\u2019m the oldest granddaughter for her and only one that was very old when she got diagnosed. but my parents are divorced and remarried, and if she ever gave those to any of my step siblings honestly i\u2019d raise hell lowkey. internally because i\u2019m a pussy but that wouldn\u2019t be okay with me unless it was for forever and ago. my moms only been married a year, but my dads been married for 12 years. i have a 25 year old brother, 20 year old brother, 18 year old brother, and 15 year old sister. my stepmoms kids are 28,29,33,34. if my paternal\ngrandfather had something similar that he had given to my dad, and it was passed onto my step brother bc he\u2019s the oldest, i don\u2019t think that would be right at all. honestly it\u2019s be weird if my dad would\u2019ve given it to my stepmom kinda i guess. idk that just way pushing the limits and it\u2019s fucked up\n\nedit- sorry i\u2019m high and also wanted to\nsay this, i\u2019m so sorry for your grandfather and his brother. i\u2019m sorry your family went thru that. my g gpa and gpa and other g gpa fought for the united states. if they ever did anything for that to happen to them, i\u2019m not educated enough to know, i\u2019m sorry. but i do understand keepsakes and what family means\u2665\ufe0f", "Oh man\n\nYou have no clue how much my heart breaks reading this. Having stuff stolen from you sucks always - but this is just \u2026 \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd7a", "I really lucked out in that regard. My grandmother had a ring that was already in her size that my fiance\u00e9 absolutely adores. It may not be very traditional, but the sentimentality is high. The stone is a piece of Jade that my grandmother's dad found with my grandfather and it was set into a ring by a family friend of theirs.", "Yes!!! OP can tell Laura to get an heirloom from her own grandpa.", "Me too. Take the necklace. Your grandfather already made plans to make it a necklace, so it's already spoken for. You could be nice and loan it for a something borrowed, but I've read too many reddit horror stories about jewelry. It's yours, just make sure you honor your grandfather.", "Agreed! You are your grandfathers girl you can tell. I guarantee he appreciates you so much for thinking about him in all of this. Congrats on your engagement!", "The fact that OP refused to have it cut to fit her style speaks volumes. If anyone is worthy of grandpa's diamond, it's op.", "It can be her something \"new\", i know its normally the dress that is the \"new\" but who knows, maybe OP is into vintage gowns and can do the tradition backwards since the Jewellery is normally \"old\" or \"borrowed\".\n\nOP, stand your ground, you are doing the right thing, and your grandfather will respect you more for this. I know the respect isn't the reason for doing this but it is important for you grandfather to know he has someone who loves and respects him enough to follow through with his wishes and to not go against them.", "Oh, Lordy, didn't think about that! Perhaps her fianc\u00e9 is supposed to be a gold digger type, also?\n\nOTH, there's was no way my husband could afford an engagement ring, or both of us would have started marriage with mutual debt. We were too levelheaded to do so. My parents sat down with us, and offered the small diamond from Mom's original engagement ring. My husband had it reset in an updated, but simple setting. This was affordable. Of course, we both had a clue that my parents wanted their daughter to have a diamond, of some sort, as they were well-to-do, by this time. But this had not always been the case. They respected my husband (and me) for avoiding the unnecessary expense of a diamond. The lack of debt enabled us to purchase a small house, a few months prior to our wedding.", "I didn't know about the peanut allergy.  That's interesting.  I'm glad you're happy with your ring!!!"]}
