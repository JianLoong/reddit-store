{"id": 6901, "submission_id": "107gbw9", "title": "AITA for refusing to pressure my grandfather to give my stepsister the family diamond?", "selftext": "Context - I am 25F, my parents have been divorced for 15 years, my dad has been married to his wife Laura for 10 years. Laura has two daughters, Katie (26F), and Sam (22F). My dad is very close to Katie and Sam and considers them to be daughters to him. The grandfather I am referring to is my dad's father.\n\nMy grandfather has a diamond that belonged to my great grandmother, and it's something of a family miracle, since my grandfather managed to find it after WWII. Unfortunately, he lost his mother and sister in the war, so he saved the diamond to be for the next woman in the family (to be set into an engagement ring). Now, my grandfather has a thing about blood and family, namely if you're not blood, you can be family, but you're not *in* the family (I am pretty sure this somewhat related to his trauma but it might be a generational thing). Because of this distinction, his sons were not allowed to use the diamond for their wives' rings because then the diamond would belong to the wife and the wife is not blood. I am his only biological granddaughter, so it was always presumed that the diamond would go to me.\n\nI got engaged last year, and I didn't end up using the diamond for the ring. The diamond was not the colour or cut of the style I wanted, and my grandfather knew that. He offered to have the diamond recut but I begged him not to because it is very valuable and I know how much it means to him, and he agreed that when I get married he will set it into a necklace to be worn on my wedding day instead. \n\nNow, Katie is going to get engaged soon. My dad is likely to be asked to walk her down the aisle. Laura asked that my grandfather give her the diamond for her ring, since she is basically my father's daughter. My grandfather said, and I quote, \"not even over my dead body\", and that the diamond will stay in the family. That said, Laura, my dad, and Katie are now extremely upset. My dad suggested maybe I could ask my grandfather to let them use the diamond, since I hadn't used it for a ring anyway, and that he considers Katie part of his family and will be forever, so it should be okay for her to have it, especially since she is older so the \"first\" woman as it were. My grandfather would probably relent if I asked him, but I said no because I would feel too guilty. That diamond is all my grandfather has left of a family he lost in the most horrific circumstances when he was 9 years old. They don't even have graves, that stone is literally all he has to remember them. What right do any us have to dictate what he does with it?\n\nKatie, Laura, and my dad have all been texting and calling about how hurt they are that I am letting my grandfather exclude Katie from the family, and that I already have a ring, why can't I just help my grandfather soften and let Laura and her kids be part of the family. I'm holding firm on it for now, but should I be?", "created_utc": 1673276061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gbw9/aita_for_refusing_to_pressure_my_grandfather_to/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because Katie doesn't get a payout to become part of the family?  How about your dad respect his father's wishes?  His property, he can do with it whatever he wants, which is not give it to someone that is only in his family by marriage.  YOU are grandpa's family.  YOU get to carry on the tradition that is so important to him.   And your dad is totally awful for trying to manipulate you into manipulating your grandfather.  \n\nIt isn't your grandfather's job to make sure this childish woman feels welcome.  He has a great plan, by putting it in a necklace for you, his blood granddaughter.  Stand firm.  Don't get tied up in their schemes.  Your dad is sacrificing his integrity to get in good with his new wife.  And her daughter is totally entitled.  Next will be she \"deserves\" a different thing because she didn't get this.  \n\nThis is just golddigging with extra steps.  I am sorry your dad is not seeing it for what it is, but that is exactly what it is.", "NTA.  This is a very traumatic situation for your grandfather, and he clearly wants you to have something that is very sentimental and meaningful for him. It doesn't matter what the item is. It belongs to him, and he should be able to do what he wants with it. \n\nWould they be putting the same pressure on him if it was a glass bead or a photo? Of course not.  They want a big shiny rock,  and they don't want to pay for it.", "NTA. It\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s choice what to do with his heirloom.

If you\u2019ve accepted the offer of setting the diamond to be worn as a necklace on your wedding day, then it\u2019s been spoken for and a done deal. Not your problem if the others don\u2019t like it. Also, my bff has a right hand diamond ring that was her g-grandmother\u2019s engagement ring. I know the cut isn\u2019t you\u2019re preference for your engagement ring, but with respect to your grandfather\u2019s wishes, could you have it made into a right hand ring?", "NTA, your grandfather should get to decide. It is not your job to pressure anybody, especially if it's already basically agreed upon that he will have it put into a necklace for you. He feels the way that he feels, and no one is entitled to a diamond anyway.", "Nta, this is your grandfathers decision.  If they don't like it then THEY talk to him.   This doesnt really have anything to do with you. Frankly, that they are pressuring you to make him to what they want is a tad disgusting.", "NTA - There is only one diamond and there are three women that your dad considers to be daughters. Two of you were always going to be excluded from this tradition. Since the stone currently belongs to your grandfather, he gets to decide which of you gets it. Even if we take the blood relative aspect out of it, between you and your step sisters you have the longest standing relationship with your grandfather.", "NTA.\n\nI'd have said \"N A H\" until they told you that Katie is the \"first\" woman - she's been in your grandfather's life for about 10 years, you've been part of his life since birth.\n\nUltimately, this is your grandfather's decision. I think the rest of your family needs to respect that. It's not a slight to them to not get something of his, they're making an issue where there really doesn't need to be one.", "NTA.

Tell your grampa what your Dad and Stepmom are trying to do so he's aware.

No piece of rock should change the fact whether they belong in a family, they are the ones valuing themselves with it.", "NTA it is your grandfather's diamond. He should not feel pressured. Stand by him and his wishes.", "NTA. It's ultimately your grandfather's decision what he does with the diamond. It was probably intended to go to you even before your father remarried, and it's not fair of them to ask you to give it up \"because you already have a ring.\" That's not the point. It has serious sentimental value to your grandfather and to you, so it should go to you.", "NTA, you'll always have a different relationship with your grandparents than your step siblings. In your case it seems like your grandpa's been there from the start so in reality he'll see you different. The diamond is going into a necklace for you, so it's not like you're not using it. You'll really appreciate this gift from your grandpa in the future. Don't let them bully you out of it.", "NTA - hold firm. It\u2019s your grandfathers property and he has the right to give the diamond to whomever he chooses and shouldn\u2019t be harassed to do otherwise. He has decided to give the diamond to you as a necklace so it\u2019s not available anyways.  Your father if he chooses can start his own traditions.", "NTA. I agree that no one has a right to dictate what your grandfather does with the diamond. Even if I don't agree with his definition of \"family,\" it is his heirloom to decide what to do with. I think setting it into a necklace to be worn on your wedding day is a wonderful idea. If you happen to have a daughter some day, you could pass it on to her.", "Info: why on earth are you the one responsible for this? This is your father\u2019s father, why can\u2019t he ask his own dad rather than trying to guilt trip his daughter into doing it?", "NTA\n\nstand your ground.

It's incredibly unfair that your family is putting all this pressure on you when it is your grandfather's decision to make alone.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your grandpa\u2019s decision and his diamond. He needs to make a will or make sure that junk is in there, called out, and specifically given to somebody in the blood family.\n\nLaura, Katie, and your dad can be as mad as they want. Grandpa could easily set it in a row boat with his body and have the thing explode in the ocean (post death). It\u2019s his to do what he wants with.", "NTA.

I'm getting the idea that the diamond is just as important to you as it is to him.\nYour father pressuring you to ask him to give it away, knowing that he probably would, is so manipulative. It's not his place.", "Yes you should! Your grandfather owns the stone and he gets to decide who he gives it to. He's always been very clear about his 'rule' so I don't see why your dad is upset.

Katie has a fiance, he buy her a diamond.", "I kinda like when views are challenged for the sake of growth, regardless of old/outdated/new/woke.\n\n\nWhy is it more important that they have it as a ring than you in a necklace? \nHad they been your biological sisters would they then have claimed the \"Im the oldest\"? That is just as outdated as \"Family by blood\". And grandpa could still have chosen to give it to whoever he had a closer bond with. \nOr is it more important since they are not family? Of course it would be a nice gesture of grandpa but thats all, a beatiful gesture. The ring isnt a required proof of being family.\n\n\nThey may feel excluded by grandpa for his reasons. I would too! But I also wouldnt pretend my right to the diamond be greater than yours either. \nAnd its not nice of your father and sisters trying to pressure the both of you to it.\nIt kind of takes away the \"nice\" of the gesture if its forced.", "Though I think your grandfather could have phrased it in a better way, I don't think anyone has the right to try to make him give a family heirloom to someone he doesn't see as family. Also, it was already promised to you, his eldest biological granddaughter.\n\nSeems rude to me that Katie even asked for it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, Grandpa's wishes matter most all. Really sounds like someone wants a free diamond to me.", "INFO\n\nYou said he found the diamond already cut? After ww2? Thats not ominous at all...", "And they became his step-grandkids as teens. It's  not like he's been in their lives since they were babies. They likely didn't grow up viewing him as their grandfather at all and while he may like them they aren't his grandkids by blood or by social convention given their ages.", "For this statement alone, the diamond should go to you.  Allow him to set it in a necklace and wear it all the time.  I\u2019ll make your grandpa happy.  NTA", "Made me cry!", "Ummm....isn't Katie getting engaged to someone? \n\nDoesn't THAT person have a role to play in procuring and offering a ring for an engagement?\n\nI have never heard of a woman hunting down her own engagement ring. It's her boyfriend's job to acquire the ring with his resources.", "Especially when the grandpa has so much sentimental value to the ring. Let him do what he wants with it. Such a sad story.", "Yeah. NTA. If they want the diamond, they talk to him. Hold firm and also ask them to not put you in the middle between a manufactured argument designed to make them get what they want and make you feel bad for not agreeing with them.\n\nOh man I \\*hate\\* jewelry arguments. Everyone fighting over 5 grams of rock.", "He did ask. My grandfather and dad don\u2019t have the easiest relationship, I am much closer to him. Also, because I am the person who stands to get the ring and the person he wants to have it, if I asked that he give it her, he probably would.", "You could ofcourse rather easily prevent that from happening. Really legally that's not a problem at all.", "I think in this case it's not even that narrow minded. These girls entered his life when they were already teens. I doubt they view him as a grandfather figure and they likely had their own grandparents already. It would be one thing if they had been in his life since they were toddlers but that doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nI have a step-parent and my step-grandparents entered my life when I was in elementary school. They've had a hugely positive  impact on my life and I am grateful for everything they've done for me. However, I would never dream of throwing a fit about not getting a family heirloom over one of their biological grandkids. If they did leave m something that precious I would cherish it, but never expect it. I have heirlooms and knick-knacks from my biological grandparents already, why would I take that away from my step-cousins?", "I usually agree with this mindset being old fashioned but it sounds like her grandfather is a Holocaust victim. \n\nHis family was almost eradicated specifically because of their bloodline. I can\u2019t imagine what that does to someone\u2019s ties to the blood-related family that remains.", "Came here to say this!", "No, I didn\u2019t. He knew from before I even met my fianc\u00e9 the rings I liked, he was in the diamond business for many years and he spent a lot of time teaching me about them when I was growing up. When I was going to get engaged he had me and my fianc\u00e9 over and offered to recut the stone. I said I wouldn\u2019t want to cut it, and would use it as is, and he said he knew I preferred something else and that I should have a ring I fell in love with. I said I still wanted to wear it but he thought it was too large to set into anything other than a cocktail or engagement ring, and that\u2019s where the necklace idea came from.", "He didn\u2019t find it randomly. It belonged to his mother, it was the stone from her ring. They hid it, among either things, before they were arrested. After the war, he returned to where his home had been to find what they\u2019d hidden. He didn\u2019t find most of the other stuff, but that was one of the few things he did.", "Reading between the lines, it seems your grandfather lost his family specifically because of their blood/genealogy. It makes sense that his own survivors matter so much to him.", "Yes!", "My guess is they\u2019re sure the guy is about to propose and have decided it\u2019s been enough time and he needs to and they\u2019re lining up an \u201cappropriate \u201c ring. Anything the poor guy proposes with isn\u2019t going to meet their standards. I also Wonder if he\u2019s aware he\u2019s getting engaged soon. \ud83d\ude02", "As a woman who \"hunted down\" my own engagement ring, this is pretty outdated thinking. You're not wrong that it should be between Katie and her s/o, but now you've heard of a woman doing it!", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s putting you in a terrible spot and should never be trying to get you to coerce somebody you care about into doing something that person doesn\u2019t want to do.", "That's what I thought too. OP is definitely NTA.\n\nAlso, OP, if your grandpa was indeed a Holocaust victim, has he ever checked Yad Vashem's database? Their database might have testimonies regarding his loved ones.", "Oh, I agree, I did say *might* be, though I missed the -seen as- qualifier for sure.\n\nI don't think it's narrow minded either, personally, I just believe that it 100% isn't her job to \"fix it\". That's a father-son discussion.", "There's no way in hell any step kids in the family should end up with this. Your dad and stepsister are completely out of line.", "Ah like that. My mind really went to some dark places on the word found."]}
