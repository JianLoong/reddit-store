{"id": 6901, "submission_id": "107gbw9", "title": "AITA for refusing to pressure my grandfather to give my stepsister the family diamond?", "selftext": "Context - I am 25F, my parents have been divorced for 15 years, my dad has been married to his wife Laura for 10 years. Laura has two daughters, Katie (26F), and Sam (22F). My dad is very close to Katie and Sam and considers them to be daughters to him. The grandfather I am referring to is my dad's father.\n\nMy grandfather has a diamond that belonged to my great grandmother, and it's something of a family miracle, since my grandfather managed to find it after WWII. Unfortunately, he lost his mother and sister in the war, so he saved the diamond to be for the next woman in the family (to be set into an engagement ring). Now, my grandfather has a thing about blood and family, namely if you're not blood, you can be family, but you're not *in* the family (I am pretty sure this somewhat related to his trauma but it might be a generational thing). Because of this distinction, his sons were not allowed to use the diamond for their wives' rings because then the diamond would belong to the wife and the wife is not blood. I am his only biological granddaughter, so it was always presumed that the diamond would go to me.\n\nI got engaged last year, and I didn't end up using the diamond for the ring. The diamond was not the colour or cut of the style I wanted, and my grandfather knew that. He offered to have the diamond recut but I begged him not to because it is very valuable and I know how much it means to him, and he agreed that when I get married he will set it into a necklace to be worn on my wedding day instead. \n\nNow, Katie is going to get engaged soon. My dad is likely to be asked to walk her down the aisle. Laura asked that my grandfather give her the diamond for her ring, since she is basically my father's daughter. My grandfather said, and I quote, \"not even over my dead body\", and that the diamond will stay in the family. That said, Laura, my dad, and Katie are now extremely upset. My dad suggested maybe I could ask my grandfather to let them use the diamond, since I hadn't used it for a ring anyway, and that he considers Katie part of his family and will be forever, so it should be okay for her to have it, especially since she is older so the \"first\" woman as it were. My grandfather would probably relent if I asked him, but I said no because I would feel too guilty. That diamond is all my grandfather has left of a family he lost in the most horrific circumstances when he was 9 years old. They don't even have graves, that stone is literally all he has to remember them. What right do any us have to dictate what he does with it?\n\nKatie, Laura, and my dad have all been texting and calling about how hurt they are that I am letting my grandfather exclude Katie from the family, and that I already have a ring, why can't I just help my grandfather soften and let Laura and her kids be part of the family. I'm holding firm on it for now, but should I be?", "created_utc": 1673276061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gbw9/aita_for_refusing_to_pressure_my_grandfather_to/", "score": 854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because Katie doesn't get a payout to become part of the family?  How about your dad respect his father's wishes?  His property, he can do with it whatever he wants, which is not give it to someone that is only in his family by marriage.  YOU are grandpa's family.  YOU get to carry on the tradition that is so important to him.   And your dad is totally awful for trying to manipulate you into manipulating your grandfather.  \n\nIt isn't your grandfather's job to make sure this childish woman feels welcome.  He has a great plan, by putting it in a necklace for you, his blood granddaughter.  Stand firm.  Don't get tied up in their schemes.  Your dad is sacrificing his integrity to get in good with his new wife.  And her daughter is totally entitled.  Next will be she \"deserves\" a different thing because she didn't get this.  \n\nThis is just golddigging with extra steps.  I am sorry your dad is not seeing it for what it is, but that is exactly what it is.", "NTA.  This is a very traumatic situation for your grandfather, and he clearly wants you to have something that is very sentimental and meaningful for him. It doesn't matter what the item is. It belongs to him, and he should be able to do what he wants with it. \n\nWould they be putting the same pressure on him if it was a glass bead or a photo? Of course not.  They want a big shiny rock,  and they don't want to pay for it.", "NTA. It\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s choice what to do with his heirloom.

If you\u2019ve accepted the offer of setting the diamond to be worn as a necklace on your wedding day, then it\u2019s been spoken for and a done deal. Not your problem if the others don\u2019t like it. Also, my bff has a right hand diamond ring that was her g-grandmother\u2019s engagement ring. I know the cut isn\u2019t you\u2019re preference for your engagement ring, but with respect to your grandfather\u2019s wishes, could you have it made into a right hand ring?", "NTA, your grandfather should get to decide. It is not your job to pressure anybody, especially if it's already basically agreed upon that he will have it put into a necklace for you. He feels the way that he feels, and no one is entitled to a diamond anyway.", "Nta, this is your grandfathers decision.  If they don't like it then THEY talk to him.   This doesnt really have anything to do with you. Frankly, that they are pressuring you to make him to what they want is a tad disgusting.", "NTA - There is only one diamond and there are three women that your dad considers to be daughters. Two of you were always going to be excluded from this tradition. Since the stone currently belongs to your grandfather, he gets to decide which of you gets it. Even if we take the blood relative aspect out of it, between you and your step sisters you have the longest standing relationship with your grandfather.", "NTA.\n\nI'd have said \"N A H\" until they told you that Katie is the \"first\" woman - she's been in your grandfather's life for about 10 years, you've been part of his life since birth.\n\nUltimately, this is your grandfather's decision. I think the rest of your family needs to respect that. It's not a slight to them to not get something of his, they're making an issue where there really doesn't need to be one.", "NTA.

Tell your grampa what your Dad and Stepmom are trying to do so he's aware.

Stand by him and his wishes.", "NTA. It's ultimately your grandfather's decision what he does with the diamond. It was probably intended to go to you even before your father remarried, and it's not fair of them to ask you to give it up \"because you already have a ring.\" That's not the point. It has serious sentimental value to your grandfather and to you, so it should go to you.", "NTA, you'll always have a different relationship with your grandparents than your step siblings. In your case it seems like your grandpa's been there from the start so in reality he'll see you different. The diamond is going into a necklace for you, so it's not like you're not using it. You'll really appreciate this gift from your grandpa in the future. Don't let them bully you out of it.", "NTA - hold firm. It\u2019s your grandfathers property and he has the right to give the diamond to whomever he chooses and shouldn\u2019t be harassed to do otherwise. He has decided to give the diamond to you as a necklace so it\u2019s not available anyways.  Your father if he chooses can start his own traditions.", "NTA. I agree that no one has a right to dictate what your grandfather does with the diamond. Even if I don't agree with his definition of \"family,\" it is his heirloom to decide what to do with. I think setting it into a necklace to be worn on your wedding day is a wonderful idea. If you happen to have a daughter some day, you could pass it on to her.", "Info: why on earth are you the one responsible for this? This is your father\u2019s father, why can\u2019t he ask his own dad rather than trying to guilt trip his daughter into doing it?", "NTA\n\nstand your ground.

It's incredibly unfair that your family is putting all this pressure on you when it is your grandfather's decision to make alone.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your grandpa\u2019s decision and his diamond. He needs to make a will or make sure that junk is in there, called out, and specifically given to somebody in the blood family.\n\nLaura, Katie, and your dad can be as mad as they want. Grandpa could easily set it in a row boat with his body and have the thing explode in the ocean (post death). It\u2019s his to do what he wants with.", "NTA.

I'm getting the idea that the diamond is just as important to you as it is to him.\nYour father pressuring you to ask him to give it away, knowing that he probably would, is so manipulative. It's not his place.", "Yes you should! Your grandfather owns the stone and he gets to decide who he gives it to. He's always been very clear about his 'rule' so I don't see why your dad is upset.

It sounds like OP's grandfather had 2 sons? Maybe talk to your Uncle about the situation and get his perspective. Was it a big deal to them that they did not get to propose with the family heirloom to their wives? And if not, why is this suddenly an issue? It sounds very dramatic \"give us this extremely valuable solitary family heirloom you have already given to another family member or else you're excluding family.\" That is definitely a huge jump.\n\nKeep that diamond in a locked safe or bank or something in the meantime though where no one but you and grandpa can access it.", "And get that necklace made ASAP.  Keep it in a safe place.", "I'm sure they have no answer for that, that gem was already intended for OP, probably since long before the father even remarried.

She did say that the diamond was among things that they had hid before the whole family was arrested and after the war he went back and it was one of the few things found.  They have no graves.  It's reasonable for a 25 year old to have a grandparent who was 9 during WWII.  \n\nIt is implied that the grandfather wants it to go to blood because it was because of blood that they were killed in the first place.  Holocaust isn't that much of a leap considering all these facts and circumstances.", "Telling people to lighten up when you are joking about someone holding any resemblance of their childhood before the Holocaust and them being the only one in the family to survive.

Also, the idea that a necklace could become a new family legacy is something that, I assume, would make your Grandfather's heart full.", "Yeah, it should go to OP's mom, right? + it would be passed to Grandfathers blood, namely OP. Any way you look at it OP's dad and step's are greedy, selfish AH's. NTA OP", "OP also said in a comment that the diamond was hidden before the family was arrested, and when he went back to where they were hiding after the war, he found it. Very much sounds like a Jewish family trying to avoid the nazis."]}
