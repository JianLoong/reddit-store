My biomom was actually my guardian angel of my life she did her absolute best to save me from all that even when she was dealing with her own stuff like mental illness etc. but unforunately she died. I don't talk about her with my parents (47m & 43f) alot because although they are good parents and they love me a bunch, i really don't feel comfortable being vulnerable with them like that i never have. My adoptive mom more specifically believes we are alot closer than we actually are, she's very overinvolved. And tho i can be a very affectionate lively person, privacy is very important to me even when i was little i would refuse to talk about my past more than necessary or about my mother anymore than just saying i loved her alot. My mother pried ALOT it got to the point where my child therapist told her she was being counterproductive.\n\nMy mother has always been very vocal about how proud she is about my adoption, and tells the story to anyone who will hear it. She is apart of an adoptive parents page on Facebook, she is constantly talking about it. recently she showed me this draft she was writing on her notes app and asked me what i thought. it was my adoption story, it talked about all the struggles i went thru growing up before and after and how my parents handled it and how CPS found me and how i am doing now. i asked her what that was for and she said for her facebook group. i told her not to post that, and she got very huffy and emotional about how she just wants to share our special story etc.\n\nThat's lovely and all and i appericate the sentiment of wanting to be inspirational, but i don't want the most vulnerable and raw moments of my life to be broadcasted to a bunch of strangers. she started getting REAL defensive and sassy saying it wasn't just my life and story it's her and my dad's too. I just ignored her and went up to my room, she's been weirder than normal going back in forth between giving me attitude and being overly nice and involved, i've just been ignoring her the whole time because i really can't muster up the energy to pretend to care about her mood swings. My mom's best friend ended up texting me saying i'm \"cruel and selfish\" for treating my mom like this because she loves and dotes on me. I will say this tho whether i am wrong or not if she posts that story i will forget that and our relationship will never be the same.\n\nsorry in advance for typos and horrible grammar", "created_utc": 1674759710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lzj2j/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_to_share_my_adoption/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anything before that can be summed up as what happened before we met her, how she grew up... Anything like that can be said to sum it up. There doesn't need to be details! That part isn't her story to tell! Hey telling those details is a gross amount of overstepping on her part! You're NTA for wanting her to not talk about that!\n\nShe sees herself as a martyr. She wants everyone to know how much she went through and how much she sacrificed and how hard she worked for you. She's using you for internet clout! It's disgusting quite frankly!", "NTA You said it better than I could \"i don't want the most vulnerable and raw moments of my life to be broadcasted to a bunch of strangers\".

From this story, she sounds dangerously close to one of those parents that does things for the praise of it all, which is very much not healthy for you and it's not fair for her to be upset that you won't go along with it. You become a parent to be a parent, not to brag about how great you are for it on social media.", "She's right. It's not just your story.  That said, it's not just her story either.\n\nIn order to share private details of a shared story, ALL parties must give consent.  I'm so sorry she doesn't see the truth of this and I find it reprehensible that her \"flying monkey\" best friend is actually attacking you over this.

I'm sure your adoptive mother loves you in her way, but you have rights too, and one of them is privacy and control over how your life is presented to others. My parents had no compunction about telling people I was adopted; in fact they were proud of it. Either they didn't fully realize what a stigma it carried back in the 60s and 70s or they thought by being open they could rise above it. Anyway, I came to resent that the whole world knew what was none of anyone else's freaking business and wish I had had the nerve to stand up to them.

I believe that you have the right to protect yourself from being re-traumatized by the past.  Her broadcasting your hurts and struggles as a way to show how noble she sees herself is horrible.  \n\nIf she just wants to say something like \"because of her prior trauma, our daughter had a hard time trusting us during the first two years she was with us, but we worked on being a safe space for her and our relationship improved\" that's one thing.  If she wants to detail the types of abuse that you experienced and how each of those contributed to different problems, Hell No!  \n\nAs I wrote the first situation, it occurred to me that, if they did need to work on being safe people for you and giving you a reliable and trusted place to call home, she's shattering that work by writing this piece.  If she did the work to make 7-year old you feel safe, tell her that you appreciate what she did in the past and point out that she is destroying that foundation and making you feel unsafe now.  Tell her that, if she posts this, you know you can never share any deep feelings with her again because you won't be able to trust her to keep it in confidence.\n\nI understand having someone \"share\" things I told them in confidence.  It colors our relationship to this day.  You're not wrong.", "Sounds like your adopted mom needs therapy, she's confused her story, her life, with yours.

You have every right not to want your most vulnerable and private moments shared on the internet to strangers, especially on Facebook where you\u2019re easily identifiable.

As a fellow adoptee who didn't get the greatest adoptive mother (but a fabulous adoptive father) I can empathize greatly with your struggle.", "NTA. You don't say anything about your father here. Can you appeal to him to get your mother to stop this posting? Are you still seeing a therapist who can help? If no to both, then I think you need to tell your mother what you said here - you don't want what is very personal and private broadcast anywhere, and if she persists against your wishes, it will likely alter your relationship. Good luck to you!", "NTA - Your past and much of what followed IS NOT her story to tell. Period. Her writing anything beyond her experience is a a breech of trust. \n\nShe presents as needing constant validation from others so pimping out your story does not phase her.

Best to you. I hope posting is a helpful experience for you.", "NTA but perhaps there is a way to have her only tell her side of the story and leave out anything to specifically do with you? Have you explained your reasoning to her as to why you would rather she not share the story?", "NTA  Sorry your mom is like that.", "Nta.  Write a post from your perspective stating your story and the difficulties you've had being adopted.   Be honest,  harsh if you have to, but be fair.  Then show you mother and say you want your side told as well if shes going to tell your story from her view.  It'll either open her eyes or destroy your relationship.   But that's on her.

Your story, your privacy, your sense of safety, and your sense of autonomy all deserve to be protected by your parents, not co-opted. 16 is a hard enough age as it is; you are also reprocessing your childhood story and your trauma as well.

You have the right for your privacy. It\u2019s absolutely understandable and totally normal, that you don\u2019t want to make vulnerable parts of your life public.

There are boundaries that need to be respected in any relationship. Your adoptive mom sounds like she likes the attention she gets from your adoption. It's okay to tell her to stop.", "OP, tell your mom that if she posts it, your relationship will never be the same. Tell her it shows you that her facebook group is more important than your feelings. That it is more important for her to share she is the hero and to lay bare your vulnerabilities than to respect your wishes for privacy.  It tells you that she seems to love the story, more than you.

She may be a good mom to you sometimes but I would suggest researching this on your own to try to decide for yourself, there is a lot of good information out there on how to manage a relationship with someone like that. You are not being cruel to her, it's actually the opposite and good for you for trying to stick up for yourself", "NTA\n\nYikes. Your personal history isn't hers to share. Frankly, it sounds as if she's using the relationship as a way to garner attention for herself. If she loved you as much as she claims to, she'd understand she's crossing boundaries and be concerned about how that makes you feel, not how limiting that is for her facebook group. Whether the friend texting you was Mom's idea or not isn't clear, but what the heck was that other woman thinking? I hope you still have the therapist.", "NTA. No, no, no, no, no. Your mother has no business sharing YOUR personal information with others. None at all. I say this as a 52yo adoptee. You are not an \"inspiration\". You are a person who suffered the loss of your biomom and family of origin. You have a lot of trauma. You will be dealing with fallout from that for the rest of your life. Your adoptive mother is very misguided if she thinks it's ok to share your personal information with others. You are not \"cruel and selfish\" and your adoptive mother is wrong for bringing her flying monkeys into this. If she truly \"loves and dotes\" on you, the she will not share your personal information with a bunch of strangers on the internet, or anywhere else. You're nearly an adult. Your opinion and wants count especially because it's in relation to your ACTUAL LIFE. Sadly, I bet she'll go ahead and do what she wants because she can't see you as an actual person whose preferences need to be taken into account when it comes to SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS. Hopefully your adoptive dad can talk her off the ledge, but regardless, you know she isn't to be trusted with your personal information and perfectly reasonable request for privacy ON THE INTERNET. You're not a rescue puppy. She's going to wonder why you go LC with her at some point and will never realise that it's because she isn't a safe person for you. And she isn't. I'm sorry.", "A lot of adoptive parents are like that. My aunt and uncle adopted transracially in the 60s before it was a thing. People acted as if they were saints and they just ate it up.", "Unfortunately, this sounds like my mom. I\u2019m not even adopted but I was diagnosed at a really young age with bipolar disorder. It was extremely erratic and intense when I was younger and my mother won\u2019t miss an opportunity to say how hard she worked and how much she did to get me proper treatment. And while she isn\u2019t necessarily wrong and while I\u2019m very grateful for what she did, I just wish she wouldn\u2019t treat the entire situation like a sob story about *her.*\n\nIt was *my* struggle. I can imagine it was hard for her as a mother to watch her kid go through that but it was still *me* going through it. I have no problem talking about my mental health journey but it would be nice if that journey wasn\u2019t being used so that my mother could gain sympathy. \n\nOP, you\u2019re definitely NTA. You have every right to feel the way you do. Not only is it *your* past being put on display so that *she* can look like a hero, but this is also a firm boundary you set. Just because you\u2019re a minor doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the right to set that boundary and have privacy, especially over something like a sensitive topic such as your past. Your adoptive mom should respect you enough not to share something about you that makes you uncomfortable. Your adoptive mom seems like a narcissist.", "Could not agree more ^\n\nI will also say that your adopted mom needs to realize she is the parent, and her acting out is not appropriate, and to say that it is their story too feels distasteful and perhaps selfish. Her \u201cFriend\u201d is a reprehensible C *** for calling you cruel and selfish. These behaviors are borderline if not totally encroaching on re-victimization. \n\nYou acted as the adult in giving an honest response and drawing your boundaries. I can understand her being disappointed not to share what she likely is feeling is an inspirational story. But it is your story to start and again she is the adult and parent here, she needs to check her actions and emotions and needs to understand you are and always will have to live with the actions and trauma brought about by your both parents. \n\nI grew up in home broken by domestic violence and while my situation is nothing to what you have described: I can tell you as a 30 something I deal with the consequences of that environment everyday. This is not a bad thing! But it is a burden and a blessing to be lived with, I\u2019m not sure of your adopted parents backgrounds but if they have not experienced that for themselves, there are ticks and habits that you form to survive that they simply can not understand. \n\nPerhaps there is a way to connect and heal while maintaining boundaries with your adopted mother. Perhaps there are portions you feel comfortable sharing? Write with her, make it something you can do together? Perhaps with your therapist to help mediate? \n\nUltimately though that trauma is yours not hers and if you feel uncomfortable sharing any of it that is your boundary.\n\nWe are all human, we are imperfect and as such we may in our own hurt loose sight of how we may hurt others. This maybe what she is experiencing after you asked her not to post. I AM NOT EXCUSING HER BEHAVIOR. But in order to grow we must acknowledging our actions and how they have effected those around us, so that we may move forward with greater understanding of ourselves and each other. \n\nI\u2019ll give her kudos for having the for-thought for asking permission. And it sounds like she does truly care for you, adults make mistakes all the time and that\u2019s ok. We just need to learn and grow.", "Adoptive parents in particular.", "Ya what\u2019s with a grown woman saying that to a 16 year old I never get that shit"]}
