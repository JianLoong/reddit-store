You are a person who suffered the loss of your biomom and family of origin. You have a lot of trauma. You will be dealing with fallout from that for the rest of your life. Your adoptive mother is very misguided if she thinks it's ok to share your personal information with others. You are not \"cruel and selfish\" and your adoptive mother is wrong for bringing her flying monkeys into this. If she truly \"loves and dotes\" on you, the she will not share your personal information with a bunch of strangers on the internet, or anywhere else. You're nearly an adult. Your opinion and wants count especially because it's in relation to your ACTUAL LIFE. Sadly, I bet she'll go ahead and do what she wants because she can't see you as an actual person whose preferences need to be taken into account when it comes to SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS. Hopefully your adoptive dad can talk her off the ledge, but regardless, you know she isn't to be trusted with your personal information and perfectly reasonable request for privacy ON THE INTERNET.

These behaviors are borderline if not totally encroaching on re-victimization. \n\nYou acted as the adult in giving an honest response and drawing your boundaries. I can understand her being disappointed not to share what she likely is feeling is an inspirational story. But it is your story to start and again she is the adult and parent here, she needs to check her actions and emotions and needs to understand you are and always will have to live with the actions and trauma brought about by your both parents. \n\nI grew up in home broken by domestic violence and while my situation is nothing to what you have described: I can tell you as a 30 something I deal with the consequences of that environment everyday. This is not a bad thing! But it is a burden and a blessing to be lived with, I\u2019m not sure of your adopted parents backgrounds but if they have not experienced that for themselves, there are ticks and habits that you form to survive that they simply can not understand. \n\nPerhaps there is a way to connect and heal while maintaining boundaries with your adopted mother. Perhaps there are portions you feel comfortable sharing? Write with her, make it something you can do together? Perhaps with your therapist to help mediate? \n\nUltimately though that trauma is yours not hers and if you feel uncomfortable sharing any of it that is your boundary.\n\nWe are all human, we are imperfect and as such we may in our own hurt loose sight of how we may hurt others. This maybe what she is experiencing after you asked her not to post. I AM NOT EXCUSING HER BEHAVIOR.

Ultimately, though, it\u2019s still not hers to disclose and you have every right to not want her to post about it.

At the same time, your mom is more outgoing and she also has an unusual path to motherhood and she wants to share that with others with similar circumstances. Still, it\u2019s your story too and she should respect your need for privacy. Perhaps ask her to modify the story to reflect on her experiences of being an adoptive mom without getting into the private aspects of your life. Most important, your desire for privacy should be respected and you are NTA for wanting that.", "I think you're in the right. You may want to post this on r/adoption", "NTA.

I went through school learning to be brave about the scars and answering questions about them. Then I learned that I didn't have to.

I would say, that I am a private person, and I don't mind someone asking but the story is mine. I have spoken to my husband, friends and family members and asked them to do the same for me. I am not ashamed of my scars, they gave me powers, but my story is for me. \n\nI would sit down with your parents again and just say that you want privacy with your story and that when it becomes a conversation piece it makes you feel like a 'good story' instead of a person.

Neither one of my cousins wanted people outside of family to know they were adopted. Not because they were ashamed, but for privacy reasons. They were both young, but old enough to understand what adoption is, when that famous case was aired all over TV about that little girl who was adopted and her bio dad fought and was successful in getting her back from the adoptive parents several yrs after the adoption was final.

I hope that she spends a bit more time on those things and leaves you some room to be your own person.", "NTA. Can you talk to your dad and tell him you don\u2019t want her to post your story?", "NTA. There's a philosophy of trauma called \"dumping out.\" As in, when something horrible happens--let's say someone gets diagnosed with cancer--they get to dump their feelings about it out to basically anyone in their circles, because it's happening to them. Their partner, or parent, or sibling, or very best friend is affected, of course, but not as much as the person with cancer, so they can dump their complicated, hard, upset feelings outward to other people in the circles, but NOT back onto the person actually suffering, and not against the wishes of the person actually suffering. If someone suffering asks you to keep it close to the vest, then you keep it, period. And so on, further out: the person with cancer has a coworker with a lot of big feelings, but they shouldn't go to the partner or parent of the person with cancer, those feelings should go outward, to people they feel close to, like their spouse.\n\nNow replace cancer with abuse and understand why your mom is the asshole. The abuse happened *to you.* Is it partly her story? Sure, but it's more your story than hers. She wants to broadcast your suffering against your specific and explicit wishes. That makes her the asshole.", "You are correct - your story belongs to you. Most adoptive parents know that. I never cross that line with my own kids. Want to know why? Nope, not saying; it\u2019s not my place. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve validated your perspective, let\u2019s move on to the real problem. \n\nYour mother has too much of her identity wrapped up in you. As you approach adulthood, that identity fades. The adoption itself is in the past, and you are increasingly independent of her. Especially if you are turning out well adjusted. If you have, that\u2019s a credit to her - I can assure you that children adopted at 7 very often do not. You are her most important achievement of the last decade and she\u2019s proud of you. But soon she won\u2019t have the child. You are a trophy she doesn\u2019t get to keep. \n\nThe empty nest is a difficult transition for most parents. She will need to move on to the next phase of her life. If she doesn\u2019t know what that should look like, she may be clinging to her identity as adoptive parent. That\u2019s not healthy, but it is understandable. Writing about this may be her way of working though it, or it may be a way to anchor herself. \n\nYour story and her story are different stories - parallel and intersecting stories. (Yes, mathematically that\u2019s an issue.) There is a version of your story that does belong to her, but that has to be about her journey alone. Starting with a traumatized 7 year old you don\u2019t know at all is parenthood on hard mode. She had a lot to learn, and her struggles are valid. Some of those will inevitably reference you, and it\u2019s not easy to be vague about details. But she doesn\u2019t have the ethical right to publish your part without your consent. \n\nSo then, how do you handle it? First, by trying to understand her - that will make your responses more effective. But also by trying to really get through to her at the level where she thinks you already are. She wants the mother daughter bond, so center your objections on the mother daughter bond. For example:\n\n\u2018It upsets me that you want to publish my personal story for strangers to read. But it upsets me even more that you don\u2019t understand me well enough to know why this is upsetting. I wish you knew me better.\u2019 Or, \u2018I feel inhibited about telling you much personal about myself, because I can\u2019t be sure you\u2019ll keep what I say in confidence. That makes it difficult to confide in you.\u2019\n\nBut understand that those statements could be gut punches, so don\u2019t say them unless you are prepared to stay in there. Your instinct is to withdraw out of self preservation, but that only pushes her more towards facebook for her emotional validation. If you stay in there, you may be able to convince her to back off and listen to you instead.", "NTA. It's your life and history she wants to talk about, *that* is your story and yours alone. It definitely sounds like mom wants to \"show off\" for lack of better term. There's no reason or need to share details about your life.

That's fucked up and she is completely in the wrong here.", "Its YOUR trauma that she wants to get credit for. She is sassy?
