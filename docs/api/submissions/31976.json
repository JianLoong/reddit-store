I get that she tried to placate you, and she probably seems like a \"nice\" person, but she didn't actually do her job and correct your supervisor's behavior. That's not okay and more than gives you a reason to deal with all of them in email.", "NTA \n\nBut you should check if resignation via E-Mail is valid to avoid problems in the future. In Germany in general resignation letters have to be in form of a physical letter afaik. They accepted it so everything seems to be fine. But better double check.", "NTA. No matter which culture, if you\u2019re having a crap time at work because of the work culture, you\u2019re never obligated to say goodbye/resign in person if you\u2019re not feeling up to it. Sorry that you had such a bad experience and good luck with the next job!", "Nothing wrong with that. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey don't care about you so don't waste your time caring about them.\n\nIf she brings it up again say \"There's nothing more to talk about.\"", "NTA\n\nVery professional. Your department head never cared about your feelings enough to do anything about the harassment or toxic work environment. Higher ups probably went to talk to her and your superviser about your resignation after only a few months to see what happened and were instead met with surprise. That doesn't reflect well on any leader so she is only dissapointed because higher ups are likely noticing something is wrong.   \n\n\nThere's a good chance, the turn over on that team is really high due to that nasty superviser, and there was pressure to make sure you stuck around.", "NTA nothing wrong. You don\u2019t need to talk to her and you don\u2019t need to stay in a hostile environment. Hope your next experience here in Germany is better. Most of us need some time to warm up to new people but we normally are at least polite.", "NTA - You handled your business in a business situation and kept it strictly business. \n\nSorry you\u2019ve had to experience that. Your boss sounds like an ignorant obnoxious prick.", "NTA. Don\u2019t feel sorry for them cos they were never sorry with how they treated you.", "I mean would it have been the usual way to talk to your supervisor first before turning in your resignation? Yes. I probably would have done that even in this toxic environment. But still NTA. It's not like you are required to do that. I really hope your new job has better people working there.", "As a German: no, we don\u2019t pamper new People. If you want contact, than make contact, but don\u2019t expect the others around you to come to you. Usually, if you have a Problem you talk to your Team supervisor.\nIf you have a Problem with the supervisor you go to HR. You did, so, Everything is fine.\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
