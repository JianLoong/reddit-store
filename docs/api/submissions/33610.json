She left behind a beautiful necklace handed down in our family for generations. The necklace isn\u2019t super expensive per se but the unique design makes it stand out.\n\nMy dad met his second wife when I was 8 and she had a daughter Sandra who was 9 at the time. They married a year later and moved in with us. I got along well with both my stepmom and Sandra. Sandra spent summers with her dad but other than that we hung out a lot.\n\nI have a cousin Meg (same age) who lived across the country. Her dad and my mom were my grandparents\u2019 only children. We went to the same college though different fields of study. We didn\u2019t live together but we hung out a lot and so have many same friends and acquaintances. After graduation Meg got a job in my hometown while I decided to go to grad school at a different university.\n\nSandra began working after high school and now works at the same place Meg does though different departments. To my knowledge, they are not very close.\n\nIn May, Meg\u2019s boyfriend proposed and everyone in the family was excited for her. Meg reached out and asked if my necklace could be \u201csomething borrowed\u201d on her wedding day. I said of course. The wedding was set for summer 2024.\n\nLast month Sandra\u2019s girlfriend proposed and  they were planning to have their wedding in March or April 2024. Sandra also asked to borrow my necklace and I said yes.\n\nA week ago Meg called me in tears, asking me how could I take her special day from her. Because she and Sandra work at the same place, a lot of their guests will overlap and they will see Sandra wearing the necklace before her! Meg said the necklace is our family\u2019s heirloom and Sandra shouldn\u2019t even be wearing it. Meg asked me to tell Sandra I can no longer lend her the necklace as Meg asked to borrow it first. I told Meg their weddings would be months apart and nobody would notice nor care if they wear the same necklace. Meg called me a jerk.\n\nMy family have been calling and sending messages telling me I should honor Meg\u2019s request. My dad is the only one telling me I should do as I please as Sandra is also an important part of my life while my stepmom wants to keep the peace and thinks I should not lend the necklace to Sandra. I\u2019m sure Sandra knows of the drama but she\u2019s currently working in another city and hasn\u2019t reached out to me so I guess she\u2019s leaving it in my hands.\n\nI think Sandra deserves to borrow my necklace as well.

Problem solved.", "NTA. I haven't read all the comments, but I think you should wear it to Meg's wedding.", "NTA\n\nThe necklace is now yours, meant to be shared with people who are important in your life.

Meg is being a drama queen.", "I think your cousin is being over the top about it for the reason she is stating.  If I were her the thing I would find odd is that your step sister would want to wear something passed down on your mothers side of the family when she has no connection with that side of the family .  It would be different if it was something from your dad's side since he is her step father and has been in her life since she was young.  I am sure she is thinking of it more as being a connection to you and I assume something by she finds beautiful and would love to wear at her wedding. \n\nYour cousin is saying she is upset because people would see it on someone else first but I wonder if some of your moms family is upset by the connection to your mom rather than your cousin wearing it after someone else. Maybe they don't want say that's the real issue.  \n\nAs I was reading your post my first thoughts were why would stepsister want to wear your late mom's necklace and I bet cousin and mom's side of family might not like it.    The necklace is yours and you can handle it anyway you see fit but u wanted to through out the connection to your mom idea just in case.", "Good lord what a ridiculous \"problem\" Meg has invented out of thin air. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is something borrowed. I doubt people remembered much of the bride\u2019s jewelry in the first place but if they do shouldn\u2019t it be perfectly understandable if they see the necklace somewhere else either before or after the wedding? \n\nThat\u2019s how \u201cborrow\u201d works\u2026you\u2019re wearing something another person has and more than likely has used before. You then return the item to them, and it is again perfectly understandable that the owner may use the necklace at later times.\n\nIf Meg is looking for ways to stand out, she needs something of her own. \n\nLend the necklace to whomever you want.", "NTA.\n\nMeg needs to take some massive deep breaths.
