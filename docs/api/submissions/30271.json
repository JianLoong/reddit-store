Not just ohh she\u2019s an attention seeker. Plus your brother has started a family with his wife. You have now become extended family. With the twins some parents make the call either no mom no kids or partner takes the kids to visit but with firm boundaries. This is based off of their experience with in laws and a conversation between the parents \n\nOP you only have your feeling no clear evidence on what your SIL did. I understand not being able to make a destination wedding is not feasible for a lot of people right now. Not only the money piece but no kids is hard to coordinate. Could there have been a celebration when they returned? Sounds like nothing changed on the treatment of your SIL after she had the twins. Sounds like the only reason you all tolerate your SIL is for access to the twins. What a shitty way to feel about yourself. I\u2019m only tolerated because I popped some kids out.

What your family is struggling to understand is that there is a structure and family rules within resilient well functioning families that is in place to reduce the chance that this kind of will happen.  For instance, in a well functioning family it is an outrageous concept that the family could exclude the brother\u2019s wife from the family in general and then expect to have a relationship with the children she births. This alone tells me that your parents are ineffective and incapable leaders in terms of managing the family structure.

That\u2019s awful behavior and so controlling. Making him choose between his families? And he still invited you all to his wedding???  If your brother would have told you he didn\u2019t care about your wedding, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be on here complaining.

I wasn\u2019t crazy about my SIL at first either, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and got to know her throughout the years. She comes from a very different family dynamic and what I thought was snide remarks and disrespect, was her anxiety being around our overly boisterous family. Now I love her, even though we are very different. Your brother and SIL are better off without you. I would keep my kids away from all that toxicity too.", "With out a lot of info, it all sounds so disconnected. The circumstances don\u2019t make sense. \n\nESH: just from the information given. \n\nThe brother sucks for assuming everyone in the family has the resources and time to go to a child-free destination wedding and continually complaining about it. This is actually hard for a lot of people with children, especially with the economy and also just trusting people with children in general. \n\nOP and his family suck for what seems like totally alienating the SIL from the family. Also for what seems like not giving any support to the brother. This type of thing really sucks because how do you pick between your partner and your (will be) extended family.

He might not be able to see or feel the same way you or your family do, but goddam he wanted you there because he loves you regardless. Smile and bare it.", "NTA. Any time there's a destination wedding or a childfree wedding fewer people go.
