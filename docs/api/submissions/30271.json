You say that she's disrespectful and attention-seeking and your brother says that you make her feel unwanted and are selfish for not putting your differences aside.  To me this sounds like one of those \"Which-came-first-the- chicken-or-the-egg?\" scenarios.  Is she disrespectful and attention-seeking because you exclude her or do you exclude her because she's disrespectful and attention-seeking?
