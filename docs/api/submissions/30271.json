What did your SIL do which makes everyone in the family dislike her? Unless you have a very strong and valid reason, I do think that everyone of your family members is being the AH to SIL. It's fine to skip weddings under those circumstances, but why celebrate his occasions without her? She is his wife.", "you're being very quiet OP. you're not even answering the questions asking why you guys hate her, bet it's because of something small she did that doesn't even matter so you're scared people will call you an AH just because you can't let it go", "You needs enemies when you have family like this", "YTA- but kind of. She\u2019s his family too. While none of you like her, he chose her. Time to be supportive and not make his relationship about you.", "ESH. I'm all for going low or no contact with toxic family members but you haven't given us any info to go on. Why do you all hate her?\n\nAlso, if you hate her and you're deliberately not speaking to your brother, why do you care what they think?\n\nHowever not going to a kid-free destination wedding is fine.", "What does ESH mean ? \ud83d\ude33", "NTA:  Apologize for what...telling he truth?  Sorry but bandages, physical AND emotional, are best ripped off quickly.  Drawing out the process of informing your brother about his wife only prolongs the entire process.", "NTA as you are already LC with him. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t go to the destination wedding though.", "I hate it when people get mad at others because you don\u2019t want to spend thousands and your PTO to go to a destination wedding.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe had a destination wedding with no children. Not everyone can make it. He needs to stop complaining. Ignoring everything else, you're not an ass for not making it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is NO need for you to apoligize. Your parents are AHs to pressure you, make it a HARD NO.", "NTA - a child-free destination wedding is a gamble.  The risk of destination weddings is that most people can't afford to fly somewhere, get hotels, arrange babysitters, etc.  He chose the risk and as a result, not as many people could attend.", "NTA - Nobody who has a childfree destination wedding should complain about attendance. The choice of wedding excludes, anyone with children (often the baby sitters are also invited), anyone who has no PTO left, anyone with financial hardship, anyone with illness or disability. \n\nAnyone with sense should expect that not everyone can attent thier wedding, especially with a destination and child free wedding. Also who with kids has a child free wedding? Bizarre.", "I'm sorry but you and your family sound just as bad (if not worse) than the SIL. ESH", "ESH enough said", "After nine hours there\u2019s only 88 comments.\n\nThis has to be the worst AITA I\u2019ve ever scrolled through", "ESH\n\nYour brother can't expect that everyone will be able to come to destination child free wedding. That's a lot to ask and I get why you wouldn't be able to come.\n\nIt's ESH because I'm missing reasons why you dislike your SIL so much. People usually provide examples if they actually have them. I feel like she might be not as bad as you're making her to be.", "I don\u2019t imagine a world where I am unable to attend my sibling\u2018s wedding. What does this even mean? A wedding is planned months in advance. You have months to interview babysitters and to have them as plan A, B, C in case one cancels last minute. Easily go up to where the wedding it? Well, unless it is on Mount Everest, how difficult could it be? It happens (hopefully) once in a lifetime so I don\u2019t see how investing a bit of effort in one of your sibling\u2019s most important life moments is problematic. \n\nCancelling a sibling out of family events because of their significant other seems extreme too. And very suspicious especially without details on her behaviour. \n\nSorry I don\u2019t get any of this - I am saying this as someone who currently has issues with their sibling. And still can\u2019t imagine doing this to them and giving such BS excuses.\n\nEdit to add: I just saw you are a male. Sorry to say this but it plays a role - as a 29 year old woman, I could never imagine myself with a man whose idea of impossible and not feasible would be\u2026 finding babysitters/long drive/financially planning for an event you know about months in advance. Like\u2026 life could get a lot harder than this. This doesn\u2019t even count as an obstacle. Laughable, sorry.", "YTH, if u love your brother but dont like your SIL, you could be civil w her just  for your brother sake", "INFO: what did SIL do specifically?", "Hate, Hate, Hate destination weddings. My one brother had a destination wedding in Tahoe in February. I hate snow. I had to take time off work, rent two hotel rooms for our family, and drive 4 hours each way.  My other brother decided to have a destination wedding in Portugal. I noped out of that one as we just couldn't afford the trip or the time off.", "Info: can you give examples of SIL bad behavior that made you all hate her? You wrote nothing about that in your post.", "Don't worry, I'm sure your SIL hate you guys too, I mean since you freaking EXCLUDE her of absolutely everything. \n\nOh and YTA as well as your family is. Good luck when your brother finally has enough and go NC with all of you.", "Regardless, your bro has married her and you are an uncle, SIL and twins are here to stay.\n\nApology aside, do you think you could form an amicable relationship with her, for peace?", "ESH\n\nI'm saying ESH because I feel like you don't give any concrete examples of why you hate your SIL.", "It honestly sounds like ESH. \n\nI\u2019ll take you at your word about your SIL\u2019s behavior, but your family is responding terribly. The way you\u2019ve handled it from the beginning didn\u2019t help. If your SIL behaves badly, address it in the moment. I don\u2019t know whether your family is conflict averse and behaves passive aggressively or if your family is clannish and expects others to behave as your family does to fit in and be accepted by your family instead of accepting differences that are reasonable or something else like those. But you shouldn\u2019t let a child behave badly, say nothing, and then shun them, and it\u2019s not appropriate to do it to adults. There are reasonable ways to address bad behavior, to set personal boundaries, and there are rude ways. Set personal boundaries with her and your brother, not family boundaries, enforce them, and respect his and your SIL\u2019s boundaries in kind. If this does not make sense to you or if you don\u2019t believe it will work then you should seek help from a professional therapist because these techniques do work when used properly and consistently and appropriately.", "Info - what does sil do? Without it no one can say anything.", "With such little info I\u2019m going to go with you and your entire family are TA. So, YTA", "YTA \n\nLMAO let us count the ways that you\u2019ve actively disrespected these children\u2019s parents shall we?\n\n1) You ignore their mothers existence and actively excluded her from every family activity with no real explanation as to why. \n\n2) You pretty much disowned their father and said \u201cYour not one of use as long as shes here\u201d by excluding HIM from his own family miles stones as well since the day he meet this woman. \n\n3) You and your whole rest of the family used the excuse of a destination wedding and children of your own to boycott this wedding and the union. Hell, because of the circumstances, neither you, nor anybody else in the family, had to even TRY to make it. And you didn\u2019t.\n\nAND ALL OF THAT with no real explication as to why you don\u2019t like her. We are not huge fans of my sisters BF but we act cordial. We would NEVER EVEN DREAM of excluding her from the family merely because of HIM! He\u2019s not that important to us. But SHE IS! We love HER, more then we dislike him. That is how it should be. \n\nIt\u2019s laughable that you, your mother, or anybody else in your family think, that you have ANY right to see those children. If I was your SIL I would keep you far away from by babies as well. Who knows what you would say to them to try and turn them against me. At the end of the day, the reason you don\u2019t have a relationship with your nieces/nephews, nor your mother with her grandchildren it\u2019s because of YOUR behavior. This was the choice YOU made when you decided that you hated her more then you loved your brother. \n\n That woman and his kids are his family now. Your brother would do well to keep his distance.", "YTA. Your family sounds like a bunch of bullies.", "YTA and same for your parents... 27 year olds are immature and you've just all told your brother that he's not important to your family because you don't like his choices", "Non native English speaker here, what\u2019s is a SIL?", "I'm gonna go with NTA for the specific question you asked. Your brother's wedding didn't go how he wanted because it was a destination AND childfree wedding. That in itself would have a lot of people drop out. Not liking SIL, I think, is secondary to the difficulty the brother himself created.", "Yes OP definitely yadayada\u2019d over the crucial parts. Now it just reads \u201dmy brother got married, yada yada we hate her wife, AITA for hating her\u201d. Wtf.", "INFO: We need more info before we can decide.", "Yeah there's missing reasons.", "Honestly. OP gives very little information as to why SIL deserves this level of ire. Sure, she's attention seeking. So what? I don't like that kind of behaviour either but I surely wouldn't skip my brother's wedding over it. So unless OP comes back to justify her dislike better, imma just straight up gonna assume she has no reason to dislike this woman, and is just being bratty and cruel to her brother to hurt SIL.\n\nIt's an YTA from me.", "Yeah... All I've seen is \"she's awful, trust me\". I'll give him credit on one thing: if you have a destination wedding that's also child free, you're making it a lot harder for people to come.", "Look, you don\u2019t have to love SIL, but \u201cattention-seeking\u201d isn\u2019t a reason to hate her and tear your family apart.", "You can hate the person, but respect the title.", "I notice that she\u2019s definitely affected their relationship.", "Yeah, a standout to me is that they wouldn't let her come to his birthday celebrations. Like damn, isn't someone's birthday supposed to be about them? Can't they suck it up and be around her for one day a year?? It's one thing not to want him to bring her to events if she often starts drama (which I'm still not convinced of) but his own damn birthday party?!?", "This! Well done.", "100% just from this comment they all seem like drama seekers. Like, I just imagine their family gatherings being gathering around and talking shit.", "Him not explaining how awful she is doesn't mean she isn't awful. You don't know anything yet. The only thing you do know is she is supposedly awful and makes them feel unwelcome into her own homes.", "I don\u2019t know man, I just don\u2019t like my sil. Her behavior is straight outta Mean Girls, and while she hasn\u2019t done anything major, it\u2019s the culmination of a lot of petty shit that was uncalled for. I don\u2019t know what her problem is, nor do I care enough to know. My husband and mil think she\u2019s probably just jealous of me, but I don\u2019t care enough to put up with it. Afaic, I never did anything anything to warrant her attitude towards me, and I\u2019m sure as hell not going to regularly put up with her shit. \n\nSo, I try to generally avoid her because I find her very unpleasant, but I do occasionally suck it up for my husband and his family so that he can spend time with his brother-who he was very close to before he married the sil, but even I notice that she\u2019s definitely affected their relationship. \n\nBut, like the others said, we tolerate her behavior so that the family can meet as a whole. And sometimes OP, that\u2019s what you gotta do.", "I had to recheck OP's age when I read the post.\n\nThat behaviour sounds like a teenager throwing a tantrum because they don't like their sibling's partner.\n\n\nOP and the family members that acted like that are huge assholes. And then they wonder why the brother and his wife won't bring their kids near these people.", "I think this is way bigger than the wedding\u2026", "LOL", "This. Destination wedding + child-free --> I would skip it, even if I really wanted to go", "Yep. Since OP is not giving more specific information on the \"attention seeking\" behaviour, imma just straight up assume she can't because there isn't any.", "Yeah she could be awefull. But the fact that OP couldn't give a example  while being apparantly oblivious to the fact how his examples of his own behaviour make him the Ahole means he's not a great judge of character.  Like how was she disrespectful? Call him names or insult him and his family or just dare to disagree and have a oppinion of her own?  I mean if \"attention seeking\" is the worst thing some one can come up with its shows a real fragile ego rather then SIL being a Ass.", "Yup. Destination + childfree means it's heavily gated. Most people won't be able to make it. I personally would go because destination childfree weddings are 100% up my alley AND I have the means, but I would I would be in the vast minority."]}
