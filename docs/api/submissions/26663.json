Like u said, there is no relationship. \n\nINFO:does your bio kid have a relationship with ur wife's parents?? Does she get gifts etc...\n\nSince OP said no, it's all the more reason for me to say NTA. Your wife should not expect things from ur parent's for your stepchildren.", "NTA.\n\nSeems like you're wife is only worried about \"indifferences\" when it comes to gifts.", "NTA. Your step kids have their own Teo sets of grandparents, assuming they're alive, and I'm quite certain they don't send your child gifts. If they do however,  my judgment 'might' change", "NTA but your wife is. If she wants them to be treated equally, she should put the effort in. Your parents are under no obligation to automatically treat your stepchildren the same as your daughter. Do her parents regularly and equally interact with your kid and send her gifts?", "NTA\n\nI don't think step parents should force anything on their step kids, especially relationships with family members who aren't technically their family and will hardly ever see them.\n\nWould it be nice for your parents to go out of their way to bond with your step kids and get them gifts, yes. Should they be expected to do that, no.", "Nta your wife onl\nY care when her kids get left out.

They have barely ever spoken and the two did not step\nIn as a quasy step grand parent role. They have no obligation to send them gifts\n\nDo those kids grand oarents send your kid gifts? If not then your wife needs to calm herself", "NTA. Relations are not obliged to send gifts to someone they barely know or even if blood connection - that is not actively trying to keep the relationship alive and on good terms.\n\nDo the boys' grandparents send gifts for your daughter?", "NTA\n\nYour parents don\u2019t know your step kids", "NTA.\n\nThere was a similar post yesterday or sometimes when a mother was upset her MIL does not engage much with her step-grandkids?", "NTA\n\nWhile it would be ideal, it\u2019s not the reality. Blended families aren\u2019t \u201cadd water\u201d and instant family. I would never have expected my step siblings grandparents to send me a gift or vice versa. It didn\u2019t even bother me. I barely knew them.", "NTA. Do her parents send a gift for your kids birthday?", "NTA. I will never understand why people insist on others loving their children when there is no connection. Its dumb.", "NTA. You cant force familial feelings. IT almost always has the exact opposite effect. Their not the grandparents of your partners kids., They didn't see them when they were born, didn't watch them grow up. There is no relationship. Tell your partner her kids have their own grandparents. How many gift have they giving to your kid?", "My grandma was the sweatest person in the world, but it wasn't a custom for her to buy my stepsiblings gifts. If there was an actual party she would buy something small, but it just wasn't a custom to buy them gifts (she lived like 300 meters from us, second closest neighbour, so she knew my stepsiblings well).\n\nThis isn't an 'indifference' kind of thing, it's just not very customary, they have their own grandparents. \n\nIf the other kids get presents from their step grandparents, it might not be a weird ask to at least get them something small, just to make things fair, kids can take stuff like that personally and interpret it the wrong way... But definitely NTA, this is common.", "It was your and your wife's responsibility to foster a relationship. The two of you absolutely had a responsibility to do that, and your parents' lack of connection os your fault. That said, it doesn't take a deep connection to send a token gift to a kid, and if your parents even know when their birthdays are, they should at minimum have sent a card or something. ESH.", "YTA. No your parents don't need to send them a gift but they could at least acknowledge them with a simple card. They are part of your family now and you play a parenting role in their lives. They are being very rude and you are condoning it.", "ESH why not compromise and just ask if the grandparents would be willing to send a giftcard or something?", "Yta i don\u2019t see how anyone can think otherwise. My mom\u2019s husband\u2019s parents always got me stuff even if we didn\u2019t meet, even now as a grown up and they gift my children stuff to. It doesn\u2019t take much to find a small thing, make a phone call or just posting a card.

The idea why single parents won't discuss these things before actually remarrying still baffles me.

There's this push now for step mothers to be on equal footing as biological mothers 'for the best interests of the children' and step kids to be on equal footing as biological kids unfortunately they also think that goes for the rest of the family and friends regardless of how they feel about the situation.", "They are part of ops family.
