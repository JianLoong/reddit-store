We got invited to a Halloween party at first we weren\u2019t sure if we were going. This party was a no kids party. When my wife and I talked about going we had agreed that we would only go for a couple hours since I didn\u2019t know how my anxiety would be, and we had no where to leave my 13 year old son. The host of the party is a good friend of mine so he said to bring him along he can hang out inside the house. Party day came, and we ended up staying longer than expected. My son was distracted inside like a normal boy now and days on his phone. When I noticed he fell asleep (around midnight) I started slowly saying bye to some friends as I knew it was time to go. 1am hit and I told my wife let\u2019s go. I didn\u2019t think much of it, but once we were in the car I noticed she was upset. We got home, and well\u2026 she was pissed odd because we left \u201cearly\u201d and she wanted to stay. I didn\u2019t want her to hitch a ride because everyone else had been drinking so I wanted to make sure she made it home safe. So now I\u2019m the bad guy for this, and we haven\u2019t been talking much, she doesn\u2019t want to apologize as she feels like she\u2019s on the right.", "created_utc": 1667578919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym3axx/aita_for_leaving_the_party/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had an agreement ahead of time, she knows what your issue is, and 1 am is way late to stay at a party even if you didn't have your 13 year old son with you. What's the pouting all about?"]}
