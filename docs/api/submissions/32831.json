My husband took the car to work so my brother dropped us off and my husband was going to pick us up. \n\nWe were there for a couple hours and the kids had loads of fun. But they\u2019re 5 and 3 and were exhausted by the time my husband had to pick us up. I was also extremely tired. I ordered them some fries and then we sat at one of the tables at the food court. After a bit, I gave my oldest my phone to watch something while my younger one was napping in my arms. My husband was stuck in traffic so he was going to be late by an hour so yeah. \n\nWhen we first sat down, the food court was pretty empty but it filled up fast. A young woman and her mother approached us and asked if we were done with the table. I apologized and said no. The younger lady got annoyed and said we clearly aren\u2019t eating anything and that I\u2019ve been sitting at the table doing nothing for 20 minutes now. I apologized and said she could ask someone else. She then started to guilt trip me about her mother being old and tired and how my kids and I are still young so we should be able to give up our table. I said I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s nothing you could say to make me move, please ask someone else. \n\nShe then got closer and started yelling about how disrespectful and rude I\u2019m being towards her sick mother. It was very loud and other people started looking. My oldest got scared and my younger one who was napping woke up upset. I immediately asked her to be quiet as she\u2019s scaring my kids. She rolled her eyes at me and said my kids are in public and aren\u2019t entitled to quiet. I just said you and your mother aren\u2019t entitled to a table either. \n\nShe got mad and said it\u2019s entirely different but a security guard approached us. We explained what happened and he told her that she was causing a scene and she left after calling me rude and entitled. The security guard then told me that I should\u2019ve just given up the table but it\u2019s none of his business and walked away. \n\nMy husband said I did good but his coworker that was with him privately told me I couldn\u2019t have been that tired and that I\u2019m in public and should have some awareness. He said older people need to sit down more than little kids do and definitely more than I do. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nNo, the young lady and her mother didn\u2019t have food with them. \n\nThe table I was sitting on was just one small table and two chairs, my oldest on one seat, me and my youngest on the other. \n\nI\u2019ve also been to this mall countless times for years now and no one has ever been told to leave a table unless it\u2019s closing time. It\u2019s a popular hang out spot for teenagers as well.

Especially while holding the little one while they slept. Maybe if the other lady had had a better attitude, you'd have offered to share the table so her mother could also sit, but she came off super rude and entitled, so you owe her nothing. Not to mention the fact that she was scaring your kids. I'd have gone all mama bear on her and would have behaved just as you did.", "Senior citizens, pregnant women, and adults with small children all have similar priorities to seating in my opinion so in that sense it's first come first served.  Only ones that take precedence would be someone with a disability. \n\nI have to say, I wonder why she targeted you, were all folks at the food court senior citizens or folks with little kids?  Surely there was a table of teens or young adults.  I think she targeted you because she thought she could intimidate/guilt you into giving up your table.", "NTA they are seats in the mall, not a private restaurant. they are for mall patrons to sit down at. you were a mall patron and sitting down. sure it would be nice for the old lady to have a seat, but a mom with two small children? that's equally  needy", "So you were the only table not occupied by senior citizens? NTA. It sounds like you were targeted by her.", "There's no way that in the supposed 20 minutes she watched you sit at that table that nobody else got up after eating and left their table. She's full of bs.", "NTA - What kind of AH demands a mother holding a sleeping child gives up her seat?!", "NTA  by the coworkers logic elderly shouldn't have been in public knowing they were gonna get tired. No one regardless of circumstances is required to remove themselves from a seat they are occupying for your comfort. The last wanted to be pushy and saw a mother alone with two children as the perfect opportunity. She made a fool of herself picking on someone over a seat she wasn't entitled to. It would have been very simple and mature to accept the no and move on.", "NTA.  Tired moms with rambunctious young kids deserve some consideration as well.  \n\nMost food courts have lots of tables. Though these tables may all be full sometimes, they're always in rotation. This young woman should/could have, as easily, moved on to one of them.", "Her reaction was way entitled and over the top! What a jerk. Still, I do believe that people who are actively eating have more claim to a table in a foodcourt than those just resting.

There were no young healthy couples or bunches of teens? Unbelievable. NTA.", "NTA, and I'd go as far as to say that even if you hadn't purchased food, you're entitled to a place to sit down because humans get tired and malls are exhausting. The fact that you had a sleeping baby in your arms makes it even more ridiculous that she challenged you personally. She sounds unhinged.

I'm amazed at the audacity of some people.  I'm 62, was unable to have children.  Getting pregnant was almost easy, carrying to term not so much. Any I digress. Even without raising kids I know how quickly a 3 & 5 yr old can get tired walking in a mall. I also know that it's not going to take mom long to be worn out with 2 little ones like that in public. Add in having to wait an extra hour for dad to get there. UGH just doesn't sound like a picnic to me. NTA screamer needed to find somewhere else. Or if the table was big enough. Maybe politely asked if you minded if her mother shared your table for a few minutes so she could rest her legs. While it is slightly intrusive, it is a lot less rude.", "NTA\n\nSo they watched you for 20 minutes and no other table was freed during that time? Bs!", "NTA, last flight I was on my assigned seat was the window seat. I get there and of course there is a girl sitting in my seat. I only wanted the window to lean my head against to sleep.

Again, if my partner's co-worker offered unsolicited opinion, I would probably tell that person to mind their own business.", "NTA. Food court tables are first come, first served. If the lady and her mom couldn't find a table, they could probably find a bench or some massage chairs or something elsewhere in the mall.\n\nMy mom used to take me and my sister to the mall in the summertime because we didn't have AC and the mall did. We wouldn't even buy food, but we'd camp out at a food court table and color or read or play games to enjoy the AC before going home.", "NTA since there is no time limit to be sat down.

She made a scene which really is unnecessary.", "NTA. She asked and you said no. There are plenty of other tables (or benches) they could have asked to sit at as you mentioned they did not have food. If you were truly the only table done eating, then maybe AH, but she doesn't deserve the table just for having an old, sickly mother.", "NTA.\n\nIs your husband's coworker a parent?

People in a food court kind of police themselves. \n\nA food court allows people with different tastes in food to sit together while eating. Don\u2019t like cinnamon rolls? You can get a slice right next door! You feel like Chinese, but your kids want nuggets and fries? The food court is the place for you! \n\nSeating is first-come, first-served.
