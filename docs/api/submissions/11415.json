That's red flag #1.  \n\nManagement let you know that your conduct was unwelcome.  Likely, that's because Megan started feeling uncomfortable with you showing up specifically for her.  Despite getting clear signs that your coming in JUST to chat up baristas was unwanted, you still kept coming in. That's red flag #2.  \n\nThe parking lot conversation may have been coincidental.  But you've already made an effort to \"show up\" at times when you know where Megan is, so it may not have been. Not only that, you won't respond to anything that suggests your conduct is unwanted or unwelcome.   To Megan, someone who is dealing with a person tracking her schedule and making an effort to always show up where she is and who won't stop even when the manager seeks to address the behavior, it likely felt like an escalation.  Let me break it down for you:  MEGAN FELT INCREDIBLY UNSAFE IN THAT PARKING LOT.  She played it friendly because she was TERRIFIED of what you would do if she rejected you outright.  \n\nTHAT is what she told her manager.  THAT is why everyone at that coffee shop is now openly cold to you.  You, my friend, are scary.  Your behavior is out of line, and despite coldness that borders on open hostility towards you, you STILL won't take the hint.  Red flag #3.  \n\nYou need to start listening.  NO ONE AT THIS COFFEE SHOP WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.  Your presence is unwelcome.  Leave them alone, find a new coffee shop to get your coffee, and realize baristas are just women doing their jobs.  They are not \"hot girls who have to talk to you and cannot leave\".  \n\nIf you want a barista's number, ask for it.  If the answer is no, accept it.  But your conversations should be limited to natural interactions while taking your order and serving you coffee.  Do not track their schedules so you can show up for a particular person.  That's incredibly threatening behavior and wildly inappropriate.", "YTA. \n\nSeems like you got really creepy and weirdly attached to the baristas who are just trying to do their job. This was inappropriate.", "You seem to be confused about a few things, let me clear them up for you:\n\nCoffee shops are not there for you to hang out for hours without buying anything.  \n\nBaristas (or any service worker) are not flirting with you just because they make small talk or smile at you. \n\nJust because you're attracted to a woman doesn't mean her boss is also attracted to her and forcing her to work longer hours so he can be around her. \n\nOf course she told her boss and coworkers about the \"customer\" who made her uncomfortable.\n\nYTA", "omg, he doesn\u2019t let you loiter? what a fucking asshole (/s if you couldn\u2019t tell)", "YTA\n\nI used to work at Starbucks, and it would be very annoying to have \"customers\" not buy anything and constantly talk/flirt with the baristas.\n\nI feel like Megan told her boss because she has always been uncomfortable with you hanging out at her job constantly. You sound like you were stalking her shift. Megan is only being nice to you because she feels like she \\*has\\* to be nice to you.

The fact that an establishment requires you to buy something if you are in one of their patrons seats is normal and justified. The fact that a manager wants his employees to do their work (side work you don\u2019t know about) instead of talking to you is totally called for. And barista being talkative with you means absolutely nothing about whether she likes you or not. \n\nYou \u201cran in to her in the parking lot after she got off work.\u201d - everybody who works there thinks you\u2019re a stalker.

Man, you should have been a little bit brave and ask for her instagram account, her phone number... Talk to her in a place she's allowed to leave if you want to know her, not in her damn job. Really, you sound like a creep. It sounds like the other baristas knew you for being a creep, and they have told Megan that, after you made her uncomfortable.\nMan, please, stop this. You're making people want to run away.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you realize how creepy you\u2019re coming off.

But for her, it could be pure politeness to keep her job and even feeling cornered or forced to have these interactions. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to be creepy, but your limited interactions don\u2019t really bode well for you. \n\nAlso this could be a stretch but whatever. The manager might be in control of telling you not to loiter so much, but they might\u2019ve done that because SOMEONE ELSE complained about you or other people loitering to an uncomfortable level.", "\"I've been low key stalking this barista, and now all her coworkers and manager are giving me the side eye.

AITA?\"\n\nYTA\n\nApparently no one ever told you that people working in the service industry are PAID to be nice to you.

Sounds stalkerish to me", "And not even buying anything, just sitting at the counter talking.", "These answers are brutal but spot on.", "Don't forget approching her in the parking lot.", "Everyone's just assuming now that I was \"bothering\" them when all I did was make conversation. I've been a regular customer for years. If they had a problem with it or were uncomfortable they could've said something", "I started going there when I was a broke college student. So every once in a while when I needed to study I would just get a cup of water and use the wifi. It was never a problem until they changed managers. Now I make sure to always order something so I follow the rules. But he's the one making it personal.", "Poor girl probably asks her boss to walk her to her car at night now.\nI know I would if I had to deal with such a creepy stalker like OP.", "Hi, I used to work at a coffee shop. A lot of \u2018regulars\u2019 get really fucking weird and lack boundaries, but because you\u2019re in customer service you can\u2019t say anything. That is 100% what is happening here. The ones who are hitting on you are the absolute worst. \n\nWhat they\u2019re doing now? That\u2019s them telling you they\u2019re uncomfortable. So in the future read the room better and treat friendly employees like they\u2019re\u2026friendly employees, not your besties or potential dates.", "Except they usually can\u2019t say jack shit because the \u201ccustomer\u201d (using that term loosely since you don\u2019t buy something each time) is always right in many corporations", "And you're assuming that service workers have the freedom to tell an annoying customer to leave them alone.  They have to force a smile on their face and put up with it so they don't lose their jobs. They can only do something about it when the customer crosses a line - like waiting in the parking lot for them to get off work and giving unsolicited advice about quiting because their manager is obviously abusing their power because he's attracted to the barista.  It's obvious you were bothering them if they're now ignoring you after said incident.", "They definitely couldn\u2019t have said something, they are at work and forced to be nice to you. \n\nGet this through your head, you are bothering them! Small talk is fine, but you are there to flirt with and perv on them, and they noticed a long time ago. \n\nI can promise you that the girls working at this shop have a nickname for you that you really wouldn\u2019t like very much. You are the creepy guy at your job\n\nYou crossed the line by cornering one of the girls in the parking lot and making weird comments about how attractive she is, so now they are actively afraid of you and won\u2019t pretend to be nice anymore. But I promise you, those unfriendly glares you were getting on your last trip is how they\u2019ve actually felt about you the whole time.", "> all I did was make conversation.  \n\nYour conversation is their distracation.", "But they are saying it, right now.  They're not allowed to tell you to fuck off so they have to communicate in body language.  Which you're ignoring.", "You clearly made them uncomfortable, probably by waiting in the parking lot for a pretty barista you'd essentially been stalking, whose job it is to be nice to customers. Now none of the women will talk to you and their boss is actively trying to make you feel unwelcome enough to leave and not return.", "Lol and how exactly is he making it personal by enforcing the same rules on you as he does on everyone else?\n\nYou just feel so entitled to a free place to hang out and creep on college girls that you are reacting to him like a bratty teen talking about their mom. \n\nIt\u2019s time to grow up, bud", "How is he making it personal? Do you police this coffee shop for other patrons not ordering?  \nThe simple fact that they changed managers makes all of the rest irrelevant. New manager's rules trump old manager's rules.   \nThis is how it always is. Get used to it.", "So what you're saying is when you were a student they graciously allowed you to take up space in their buisness even at time you didn't make a purchase and now you want the same treatment? Its completely possible they changed manager's BECAUSE they wanted someone to stop it. It sounds like you're just mad you don't have a captive audience and the manager is allowing them to not give you a high level of service in order for them not to have to deal with you .", ">A lot of \u2018regulars\u2019 get really fucking weird and lack boundaries, but because you\u2019re in customer service you can\u2019t say anything\n\nCouldn't agree more.\n\nI also used to work in a coffee shop and we had a regular. Came in every single day, ordered coffee and eggs on toast. He was in his 80s, if I had to guess. Every single day, without fail, he'd ask me out to dinner. I am married. He knew I was married. Yet he'd still flirt with me (I was in my 30s at the time).\n\nI now work in retail and customers still flirt and ask me out when I just want to do my job.\n\nMost people in customer service jobs are friendly, polite and nice. This does not mean we want to date you, it means we don't want to lose our jobs because we have bills to pay.", "The manager can absolutely tell me to fuck off if they feel that unsafe. It's his establishment, he made that very clear that he makes the rules. And I'm a nice person so I'm going to listen if he would just be straight up with me. All he's doing right now is being passive aggressive which means I can't even explain myself or apologize", "One morning I was struggling to open because my coworker hadn\u2019t showed up, and this middle aged lady walked behind the counter and started filling the milk jugs. When I gaped at her she said \u2018don\u2019t worry, I live here\u2019. People project a looooot of stuff onto their local coffee shop, hoo boy.", "Will you listen to all of the people on Redditt who have explained to you that you're in the wrong?  We're being straight with you.  Retail workers, even managers, cannot tell you to fuck off.  We can.  What you are doing is bad.  Stop doing it.", "r/niceguys"]}
