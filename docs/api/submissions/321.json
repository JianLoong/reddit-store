Do you know the accusations are false? Is security your job? The guy asked for help, he had one piece of information and he was trying to use it to find answers. Yeah maybe he\u2019s wrong, so go ahead and get him in touch with security so it can be proved.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. I do appreciate you defending your team, that\u2019s very wholesome. But the guy didn\u2019t seem like he was being an asshole, just trying to figure out what was going on really. If his son did see someone around the car, then that\u2019s all he has to go on.

As someone who has been accused of stealing used sneakers in a dormitory because I passed them, along with a dozen other people, I get it.  He was very comfortable targeting someone based on nothing.  Sorry his car was damaged, he\u2019d have to call the cops for a police report anyway for the insurance company.  What was his point calling a random private building demanding\u2026what exactly?  Help in what way?  Nope, he wanted something.  And you made him feel silly."]}
