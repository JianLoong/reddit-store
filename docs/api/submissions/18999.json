She's alone home, you're not there as much because of the extra hours. So then you get home. YOU'RE exhausted. But then she perks up, because now she can finally talk to her partner, the person whose kid this is, and she can share the worries that have been on her mind for 10+ hours.\n\nBut... you don't want to hear her. You want her to be happy and cheerful.. It's a hard pregnancy, and to her, you don't care. You don't care about her feelings or her stress or her worries. You think she's overdoing it.\n\nThis adds to her worries now, because now her partner hates how much she talks. So she tries to correct it.

She's going to probably wonder if you're cheating on her,  because why else would you be so unhappy to see her face when you get home? When she talks, it's a problem.

She can't win.\n\nAnd she still has to deal with her pregnancy all by herself because you don't care. \n\nOP, you're pretty self-centered right now in yout thinking, me me me.

Kids need your time and attention.  They need a place to sleep, food, a warm blankie, a safe, loving home, and people who love them.  Have her get involved with some of her friends, family, or groups that trade clothes and infant equipment.  They are small for such a short time, and people invest too much money on stuff that lasts 5 minutes before they outgrow it.  Diaper companies and baby food companies have awesome coupons.  Go onto some baby blogs.  There are always Pampers, Johnson and Johnson, Huggies, etc. that have amazing deals.  If she has a baby shower, men in MN have diaper showers.  You invite all your manly friends over for a night of manly things, and each guest brings a box of diapers or baby wipes.  It's a very good dad bonding time!!!

A difficult pregnancy is hard, and stressful, and I feel for your wife. But constant complaining just sucks the joy out of life. I had 3 pregnancies - the second was difficult and resulted in a very premature infant. Medical complications, NICU, surgeries, you name it we went through it. It was hard on BOTH of us and complaining was not part of that picture. We were able to express our fears and stresses and cry and go to pieces occasionally but we both understood that we were in the thing together. Stress and fear and physical discomfort are things that most of us go through at some point in our lives.

My husband was working his job, getting babies room ready, we were moving also, so he was going over to the new place and working there after work, and he would also go anywhere for food I wanted because I had these cravings.  My husband was amazing and I don\u2019t think men get enough credit.  Just try and communicate with her in a positive way.  You effect change when you are the change.  Communication is so key and having a baby is stressful for both parents.  I would apologize to her and just say you are stressed out and feeling a little exhausted.  That\u2019s a normal human emotion. I don\u2019t think you are an AH.  I just think you are overwhelmed.  Plus- pregnancy can be very hard for some women so you need to be more sympathetic towards her.   She\u2019s carrying a human!

Thank God my husband was (is) loving and supportive, or the despair that knowledge brought would have crushed me. The many physical changes during pregnancy are rough on a woman's body and mind.

In my case added tests, stress tests, genetic tests, checking lakes of blood in placenta, steroid shots, checking the cyst on one sons brain. Throwing up so bad u loose weight and have to be put on meds. I mean I could go on forever but most importantly they are perfect and healthy in the end after tons of tears, work, bed rest, and appointments. So yes it is no picnic to bring these beautiful babies into the world. I will say though some women abuse the pregnancy card. I never asked for anything or complained through all my difficulties and was just so happy I got my children. Most ppl freaked when someone would say everything I went through bc I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside of spouse, parents, and siblings that I was dealing with any of it. My SIL never had one issue. Yet she showed up late to everything saying pregnant here hormones and was crying for no reason lol. I\u2019m talking holding dinner by 3 hours when 2 months pregnant. If anyone tried to talk about anything else she\u2019d just get loud and talk about being pregnant. Told us my husbands aunt wondered if my son would be jealous he wasn\u2019t the baby anymore but aunt never said that at all. Not to mention he\u2019s still the baby on my side not that it matters. Some women just want to be center of attention and everything about them. She made up issues for her pregnancy that BIL took off work and went to and found out weren\u2019t true.

And take this as advice from an older husband and father and step-father and one who has already put one child to rest, unless you backtrack and do some emergency repair, it's going to seriously hurt your marriage. If she gets to the birthdate and still has the feelings that you aren't supporting and comforting her, she's going to have a living reminder for the rest of her life that you weren't there when she needed you most. \n\nIT IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT that your wife and mother of your child feels supported and comforted during this life changing immensely scary part of her life. \n\nMy wife worked as a labor and delivery nurse for a decade and one of the major failings of our country (assuming USA) is that we have grossly ill-prepared women for pregnancy. If she follows the statistics (which are scary), she most likely has never witnessed a childbirth and even less likely to have witnessed a death in childbirth. And believe it or not, death is something at childbirth that happens. More often than not to those with difficult pregnancies. Gestational diabetes, eclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities, etc ... So she's going into a CRAZY biological process having learned nothing firsthand about childbirth. One in which she, or YOUR child may die, and she's past the point of an early exit ramp. \n\nImagine for a moment the amount of stress that places her under, and I guarantee you she's thinking about it. Every minute of her day, and most likely her dreams as well. Imagine how you would feel if you knew that you could be dead in a few months time. She NEEDS your support. I hope you can give it to her. \n\nP.S. my wife and I are real big on women's medical rights during childbirth. OB docs these days perform many unnecessary procedures to make their work-life balance better (c sections, inductions, episiotomy, etc...).

I wish people on this sub would acknowledge that the partner of someone pregnant can get emotionally burnt out as well. We get that she is pregnant and it is difficult, but that doesn't mean the partner isn't going through stuff as well. It's not to say that he is having a harder time than her. The AH part is telling her that shes having a pity Olympics, because ironically from your post, you are a competitor as well. Your response would discourage her from opening up, therefore distant. I most likely not to even punish you but because she feels like she will be brushed off.\n\nYour partner is is growing another human that you will have to stress over in the future and having your body staging a revolt against you is a valid reason to complain in my opinion. I would apologize for your comments and then try to communicate with each other. You are most likely your wife's only outlet so she depends on you. It OK to be mentally overwhelmed or burnt out, but don't take it out on your partner. Also communicate that your are stressed without seeming like your are competing. \n\n>I'm a pretty cheerful person normally, and I absolutely hate hearing people complain constantly because it really brings me down. I'm pretty sure I'm going to crack any second, so I wanted to put an end to this complaining since I just need some light in my life.\n\nI also wanted to address this quote. There is a difference between complaining and venting and it is important to recognize the difference. Your wife is venting and I believe some of your stress may be relieved if you also vented to a family member or friend.  It's ok to vent  to prevent things from bottling up. If you are interacting with other humans, especially in a work environment, all the annoyances can pile up while your social battery is being drained. An outlet is needed and at the moment your wife needs you to release the pressure. I will state again that you are also allowed to relieve the pressure.\n\nP.S.

A cheerful person is someone that remains cheerful regardless of their surroundings. They cheer up people with their personality and presence.

This thing you did, where you kept things building up until you snapped, is also not helpful or healthy. You need to learn how to broach these conversations sooner and set reasonable boundaries. For example, it's totally reasonable to say, \"I can be here for you, but I need to sleep. Let's talk during the day. I am going to bed now.\" \n\nBoth of you need to figure out together how you can put your oxygen mask on, so to speak, while helping her with hers.", "Sorry but if your wife\u2019s complaining is stressing you out this much do you really think you are cut out to be a father? \n\nYou do realize that being a parent is literally worrying all the time about how your child is eating, their health, being a therapist, ect... what exactly do you think you\u2019re signing up for?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019ve seen videos; it\u2019s wild.

I'm 40 weeks, so the end is in sight. This has been 9 months of heart burn, nausea, insomnia, round ligament pain, pelvic girdle pain.... the list goes on and on. The pelvic pain is one of the most excruciating things I've ever experienced. I can't turn over in bed or get out of a chair without searing pain that feels like my pelvis is being ripped apart. No one talks about it, because if they did no one in their right mind would voluntarily go through it. And all of this while still having to pretty much function as usual in our day to day lives, because none of this is considered debilitating enough to warrant special consideration. It's all just par for the course. Our doctors are just like \"yeah sorry that sucks, you just kind of have to deal with it.\" Can't even take most medicines to help with any of it. My OB straight up said about my PGP that \"it's the sort of pain that ibuprofen helps with, but you can't take that.\" Tylenol doesn't touch this kind of pain, and that's the only thing we're allowed to take. Literally just have to continue going about my life in some of the worst pain I've ever experienced until this baby comes out. Physical therapy helps a little. Factor in all the unsolicited advice, opinions, and judgements - plus the hatefulness of people who say stuff like \"maybe you should have thought of that before you spread your legs\" if you dare to say that standing up on the bus while heavily pregnant is hard and dangerous... the entire experience is just full of difficulties even if it's an \"easy\" pregnancy.

Just, the 'why is she being distant' reaction when he told her off for playing the pity olympics is... hm, there's a vibe where he's being kinda self righteous 'she's the problem not me' . \n\nI do agree though that's why I gave a NAH rating in my own comment. I just think he's being unrealistic when he thinks she should just stop complaining completely and be positive for him when she's... in constant discomfort, probs can't take pain medication because you can't take many of them when pregnant and there's complications in the pregnancy.

He genuinely expects her to just give him closeness without venting to him anymore. Which is ... not great.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from and why you think that way. I think I what I really meant was how he didn\u2019t really communicate. But you do have excellent points!

But thanks for telling me that, I didn\u2019t really think about that part lol", "Do you want a caregiver comparison like you want comparisons for your wife? My husband has had to deal with me having multiple disabling immune conditions and cancer and then as of last August 2 separate catastrophic injuries that mean he must do everything.

He also has to take care of 4 cats, a dog, finances, an acreage property with old trees that keep falling down, and a host of other stuff. I'm literally trapped in his recliner except to hobble to the bathroom a couple times a day. For months he also had to help with that even pulling my pants up and down and wiping. So compare away if you think her concerns aren't valid because others have it worse. My husband has it far worse than you yet I still think you deserve some empathy because it is obviously difficult for you. However just as you don't want to compare don't do it to her and do set aside a little time that is solely for you to recharge barring major issues. My husband will take like 2 hours where beforehand he makes sure I have food and drinks and have gone potty and don't need anything from him and just do something, still at the house, for himself. Last week it was just riding his motorcycle around the block for an hour. It helped recharge him.

I know pregnancy is hard on both partners. It sounds like you're carrying all of the financial burden, but honestly, she has it worse right now. \n\nThen go do something with friends or family.  Go do a hobby for a couple of hours,  send her to the movies with girlfriends or shopping for the baby, and make sure you tell her to get something nice for herself too.  Geeze, you whine way too much.  You asked for judgment, and we're giving it.  YTA period. You were rude and hurtful in what you said to her.  I get you have your own worries as well, but you two are meant to be a team and lean on each other during hard or stressful times, help lift each other up and celebrate each other's successes and accomplishments. You don't seem to like that judgment. It seems like you were looking for validation for being an ass. Well, let me tell you, you're not going to get it here.\n\nBut,  I do strongly advise you both to get out of the house, both together as a couple, even a picnic in the park and a nice walk if money is tight,  or all going to the baby.  I also suggest again that you both individually get together with your own friends and family, game night, fishing, hunting, shooting, crafts, cooking, whatever your interests are (and her's) make some time and do it asap! Because once the baby arrives, there will not be any chance of doing any of that anytime soon. Once the baby arrives, make sure you each get  1-2 hours of free time for self care.  Do a favorite hobby,  take an uninterrupted nap,  go have a cup of coffee with a friend, or a drink,  no judgments here on that.  But, schedule it on a calender for both of you to get equal free time away from the baby for your own sanitties, set a timer and be back on time or communicate your running late so who ever is watching the baby gets an equal amount for that week as well. Last thing,  find a trusted sitter, someone to watch the baby once a month after the baby is around 3 months and go on a date night, go to the movies, dancing, karaoke, picnic, a walk, whatever, just make time to reconnect as a couple. Also, make sure you wife is taking care of herself too, she should shower and nap while the baby is sleeping,  she can take the baby in the bathroom with her and put he/she in a small bassinet or bouncer while she showers so she can keep an eye on the baby.  Make sure she is eating and drinking plenty of fluids and keeps stress to a minimum, especially if she chooses to breastfeed.  \n\nI have one more piece of advice for both of you, and I truly hope you read this. There's a free app for couples called \"Paired\" each day there's a question or a quiz and suggestions, do it for at least 3 months every day, talk about your answers with each other.  Don't be upset about them. Use it as a way to have an open and honest conversation. There is a premium option as well that gives you even more content for an annual rate (it's just one rate for the two of you even though you each need the app on your phone or tablets). After using Paired for at least a month, try the free 1 week trial to the premium so you can both have access to all of the stuff and then decide if it's worth keeping or going back to the free version.  \n\nI can't stress this last part enough. It's helped my husband and I immensely. We've been using it for over 2 years now.  We love the quizzes and the daily questions, but especially the daily questions where you answer with a picture.  It's secure. No one else has access to your answers or pictures.  We both get a kick out of it when we answer the same. It's helped our marriage tremendously!  We use the free version, although we did have the premium for a year. \n\nBoth of you need to work on communication, you bottle up your worries and concerns, and your wife is, of course, pregnant and on an emotional,  hormonal 24/7 roller coaster ride.  She's growing a human,  please put yourself in her shoes, she's scared, in pain, feels like her body isn't hers anymore, because honestly it's not.  She's going through so many changes, rather than get angry at her, sit down each night and set a timer for maybe 30 minutes so she can get her worries of her chest, then you get the same amount of time to do the same.  If you want your marriage to last, you both need to work on open,  honest communication. \n\nGood luck. You both need it because the pregnancy is just the beginning.  Once your baby is born, it gets a whole lot worse and harder since you're both going to be severely sleep deprived for months, and three adventures don't stop until your child is an adult. Even then, you will always worry for them and drop everything to help them.  \n\nI'm rooting for you both.

You want the perfect inhuman husband to abuse.", "Not disputing anything except, \"this is the easy part\". That may be true for some, but definitely not everybody. My wife's pregnancy was one of the hardest times in my life, and the reason we decided not to have a second child was because I don't want to go through her being pregnant again. For the first trimester she had incredibly bad morning sickness and a host of other problems, in the second trimester she would sleep 14 hours per day, and then in the third trimester the sickness came back and she was also unable to sleep. Throughout the whole thing she had gestational diabetes, but refused to eat properly because she was so nauseous. On one side I had her doctors telling me how incredibly important it was to keep her blood sugar at the right level and that it was critical for me to encourage that, and on the other I had a wife who refused to eat properly to manage her blood sugar. \n\nThis was super hard for her. She felt terrible, her brain didn't work the way she wanted it to, she couldn't sleep properly, always uncomfortable. It was also incredibly hard for me, because not only did I have (and want) to support her through all this, but I also had my own anxiety around it without any ability to control her or even influence how she chose to go through it. During the 2nd trimester I was also incredibly lonely because she would literally come home from work, sometimes eat dinner, then go straight to sleep. For 3 months I was effectively alone because I was home to be there when she needed me, but had nobody to interact with during a time that I needed my own emotional support. \n\nIn many ways it became much easier once my son was born. I was able to help out much more directly, and we were able to share the load by sleeping in shifts. The time she was resting I wasn't lonely anymore, because I had a baby to interact or just be with, and the stress of her diabetes was reduced because now she was only responsible for maintaining her own health and not the baby's as well. \n\nAnyway the point of all that is that pregnancy can be super hard on both partners, and that actually raising the children can be much easier. That's certainly been my experience.\n\nOP is still an AH, but pregnancy is not always a warm up for the main event.", "I agree with this take except for his \u201cother people have it worse\u201d comment. \n  \nThat is, and always will be, an asshole comment.

When someone is venting, that is not the moment for providing perspective. \n \nAre there people out there who seem very dramatic and want a pity party? Absolutely. I still wouldn\u2019t make that asshole comment. People who want pity parties are that way because that\u2019s the only way they\u2019ve learned to get sympathetic attention from others.

He was more concerned with my safety than his own in the middle of a war zone.

They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care.\n\nHis wife became distant because she lost confidence that he will actually listen and try to help with the problems she is having and concluded he does not care.", "Let's wait till the baby is there, the stress won't end.\n\nYTA OP, learn how to deal with stress and how to communicate with ur wife properly.\nSaying she can't complain or should complain less is so unempathic, what does she even complain about?\nAre those the things about the pregnancy or about you? If it's the second one u should start to listen and talk to her, that's something proper communication needs.", "If this guy is working multiple shifts a day and his wife refuses to let him get any sleep, then I can see a problem that they need to compromise on. He\u2019s allowed to be stressed, picking up extra work and hoping he can make enough money. She\u2019s allowed to be worried and anxious and scared. They need to talk and come up with a compromise that gives her the time she needs to talk and him the time he needs to sleep. And they need to be on the same page as a team so they can function and manage when the baby does arrive otherwise, the next post will be from the wife about how her husband never helps with the baby or the husband that the wife is constantly nagging him. Marriage is hard work. If you\u2019re not communicating well, you make it 100x harder.", "Men aren't allowed to show emotions then yeah?", "There are men who want to be fathers and there are men who want to sire children to feed their ego. $10 to guess which one OP belongs to", "After reading his post I found it hard to believe he's ever read this sub before.

I'm sorry!!", ">I had an easier pregnancy than most. \n\n\n\nI don't think anyone's pregnancy is easy--just varying degrees of difficulty.", "For REAL! I have given birth 4 times and miscarried twice. I would cheerfully go through labor and delivery every day for a month if it meant that I didn't have to be pregnant for 9 months!!! At least during labor, I can actively assist my body in speeding up the process and the pain, as intense as it is, has a duration that I can psych myself up to get through. Not to mention that they offer relief from pain if you so choose during delivery (which only worked for me once because I have a damaged spine) but during pregnancy; they tell you to just deal because you can't take anything as it might affect the baby!", "That alone got my vote to YTA. I was pregnant three times, carried to term once. Not only is an easy pregnancy challenging, \"difficult pregnancy\" is code for *medical complications *\n\nI had those, it was terrifying. I'm not the same. Therapy helps.", "When I had my first, I literally didn't know how to change a diaper.  My SIL had to tell me which side was the front.\n\nThe baby's room was ready but I had had next to experience being around babies.\n\nI read books and focused very hard on listening to my instincts.   This combination, plus having an excellent pediatrician, served me very well.\n\nBoth my kids turned into lovely young adults.\n\nDon't panic.  It will be fine.  Listen to your baby: s/he will tell you what s/he needs.  Often it's just being held.  I spent so much time just holding my babies.", "Newborns are hard but when they get there you just kind of.. do it? If that makes sense. Waiting is definitely the worst part. We'll, and also lack of sleep", "Cannot upvote this enough.", "It's lol that OP is complaining about lack of sleep and the baby isn't even born yet. He clearly never talked to ppl who already had kids about how much sleep they got with a newborn baby", "You cray.", "His behaviour of expressing how his wife\u2019s negativity is affecting his well-being to the point of giving him stress ulcers?

I was literally up night with a teething 10 month old. If OP thinks the pregnancy is stressful just wait until the tiny human gets here.", ">One of the many, many reasons I never wanted kids\n\nHonestly, I wish more people were like you. Having kids is HARD and it's not for everyone. It's better to choose to life your best life without kids than having some because society tells you it's what you need to do. \n\nNo one needs to have kids. Living a kid-free life is totally valid.", "I had a pretty easy pregnancy (bar the fear of a 3rd miscarriage and daily blood thinning injections to stop that happening) and the worst part was the hip pain!\n\nFor the last 8 weeks I don't think I had a single full nights sleep, I'd wake up in the small hours because the hip I was lying on was aching so much. Roll over onto my other side, and an hour later I'd be awake again because now THAT hip was sore! Repeat until it got to a respectable hour to get out of bed. You shouldn't sleep on your back because it increases the risk of stillbirth, so it was just rolling from one side to the other.\n\nBut my husband was very sympathetic, despite also being woken up by me tossing and turning (not every time though, thankfully). Growing a human ain't easy, but it's easier with a supportive partner.", "You forgot the puking and the stretch marks and the haemorrhoids.. but oh yeah poor guy has to go to work. \n\nOP YTA", "Growing a human is the equivalent of being in the Tour de France, for 9 months. Not even an exaggeration, it\u2019s 1.8 time the human capacity when the max is 2.0. But go off OP! \ud83e\udd28", "If that's the opinion you hold, your welcome to have it. It's a pretty weird one but go ahead.\n\nLet me ask you a question, have you read his comments? The comments where he acts like his wife leaning on him for support is her saying his struggles don't matter. Despite the fact that he hasn't brought up any of his struggles with her.\n\nBut shes the bad guy? For going to her husband for support? Lmao, you're bonkers.", "Thank you so much, and damn! Yes OPisTA", "Lol, no lie about the anti-acids.

That was absolutely awful. Sorry you had all the rest piled on, too.", "I also have RA and three pregnancies went into remission every time but come to having and my body is broken. It doesn\u2019t get worse with each pregnancy but the pain is unreal for the first year or so", "Oh my God, PUPP is the *worst!* I had it everywhere but my face, the palms of my hands, and the soles of my feet.  \n\nI mean,  I guess it kinda turned out to be a blessing in disguise because they gave me steroids trying to get rid of it, which speeds development of the fetus' lungs, and I ended up having my twins 6 weeks prematurely, but damn.  That was one of the most miserable periods of my life."]}
