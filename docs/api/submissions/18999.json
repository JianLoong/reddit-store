You have to work to support her. You have to buy things for the baby. You aren\u2019t sleeping. \n\nYour wife is literally growing your baby.

GREAT! that's GOOD. Kudos to you.\n\nSo...what is wifey doing while you work all these extra hours?\n\nShe's home alone with her thoughts, her real complications, her fears, her sickness. She's alone home, you're not there as much because of the extra hours. So then you get home. YOU'RE exhausted. But then she perks up, because now she can finally talk to her partner, the person whose kid this is, and she can share the worries that have been on her mind for 10+ hours.\n\nBut... you don't want to hear her. You want her to be happy and cheerful.. It's a hard pregnancy, and to her, you don't care. You don't care about her feelings or her stress or her worries. You think she's overdoing it.\n\nThis adds to her worries now, because now her partner hates how much she talks. So she tries to correct it.

She's going to probably wonder if you're cheating on her,  because why else would you be so unhappy to see her face when you get home? When she talks, it's a problem. When she's quiet, it's a problem. She can't win.\n\nAnd she still has to deal with her pregnancy all by herself because you don't care. \n\nOP, you're pretty self-centered right now in yout thinking, me me me. You're going to have a child, their needs are going to have to be your priority.

Your delivery sucked. YTA. She's probably very hurt and doesn't know what the boundary for \"just talking\" and \"complaining\" is now.\n\nApologize for being unnecessarily harsh but also communicate about how you're feeling exhausted with everything. Don't minimize what she's feeling but say you'd appreciate if you guys could chill together and do something fun and relaxing.

Some, not so much!!!  There are some good books for new dads.  Some, quite entertaining.  Working hard is a great life skill. Many people do not have that ethic.  Good for you!!!  Don't let this time get away from you, though.  You need to enjoy it too!! \nIt also sounds like you are worried about money?\nYou'll never have \"enough\" money, all the time. Improvise!!  Kids need your time and attention.  They need a place to sleep, food, a warm blankie, a safe, loving home, and people who love them.  Have her get involved with some of her friends, family, or groups that trade clothes and infant equipment.  They are small for such a short time, and people invest too much money on stuff that lasts 5 minutes before they outgrow it.  Diaper companies and baby food companies have awesome coupons.  Go onto some baby blogs.  There are always Pampers, Johnson and Johnson, Huggies, etc. that have amazing deals.  If she has a baby shower, men in MN have diaper showers.  You invite all your manly friends over for a night of manly things, and each guest brings a box of diapers or baby wipes.  It's a very good dad bonding time!!!

A difficult pregnancy is hard, and stressful, and I feel for your wife. But constant complaining just sucks the joy out of life. I had 3 pregnancies - the second was difficult and resulted in a very premature infant. Medical complications, NICU, surgeries, you name it we went through it. It was hard on BOTH of us and complaining was not part of that picture. We were able to express our fears and stresses and cry and go to pieces occasionally but we both understood that we were in the thing together. Stress and fear and physical discomfort are things that most of us go through at some point in our lives.

You already sound burnt out.\n\nThe dynamic seems somewhat unhealthy...there are pregnancy groups, mothers groups etc. that serve a purpose, as do friends and family. Why are you the *only* support system? \n\nLastly, pregnancy isn't some homogenous experience for all women - mine was hell while my best friend felt better than ever.
