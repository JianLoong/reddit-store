She's alone home, you're not there as much because of the extra hours. So then you get home. YOU'RE exhausted. But then she perks up, because now she can finally talk to her partner, the person whose kid this is, and she can share the worries that have been on her mind for 10+ hours.\n\nBut... you don't want to hear her. You want her to be happy and cheerful.. It's a hard pregnancy, and to her, you don't care. You don't care about her feelings or her stress or her worries. You think she's overdoing it.\n\nThis adds to her worries now, because now her partner hates how much she talks. So she tries to correct it.

She's going to probably wonder if you're cheating on her,  because why else would you be so unhappy to see her face when you get home? When she talks, it's a problem.

She can't win.\n\nAnd she still has to deal with her pregnancy all by herself because you don't care. \n\nOP, you're pretty self-centered right now in yout thinking, me me me.

Your delivery sucked. YTA.

Kids need your time and attention.  They need a place to sleep, food, a warm blankie, a safe, loving home, and people who love them.  Have her get involved with some of her friends, family, or groups that trade clothes and infant equipment.  They are small for such a short time, and people invest too much money on stuff that lasts 5 minutes before they outgrow it.  Diaper companies and baby food companies have awesome coupons.  Go onto some baby blogs.  There are always Pampers, Johnson and Johnson, Huggies, etc. that have amazing deals.  If she has a baby shower, men in MN have diaper showers.  You invite all your manly friends over for a night of manly things, and each guest brings a box of diapers or baby wipes.  It's a very good dad bonding time!!!

A difficult pregnancy is hard, and stressful, and I feel for your wife. But constant complaining just sucks the joy out of life. I had 3 pregnancies - the second was difficult and resulted in a very premature infant. Medical complications, NICU, surgeries, you name it we went through it. It was hard on BOTH of us and complaining was not part of that picture. We were able to express our fears and stresses and cry and go to pieces occasionally but we both understood that we were in the thing together. Stress and fear and physical discomfort are things that most of us go through at some point in our lives.

My husband was working his job, getting babies room ready, we were moving also, so he was going over to the new place and working there after work, and he would also go anywhere for food I wanted because I had these cravings.  My husband was amazing and I don\u2019t think men get enough credit.  Just try and communicate with her in a positive way.  You effect change when you are the change.  Communication is so key and having a baby is stressful for both parents.  I would apologize to her and just say you are stressed out and feeling a little exhausted.  That\u2019s a normal human emotion. I don\u2019t think you are an AH.  I just think you are overwhelmed.  Plus- pregnancy can be very hard for some women so you need to be more sympathetic towards her.   She\u2019s carrying a human!

Thank God my husband was (is) loving and supportive, or the despair that knowledge brought would have crushed me. The many physical changes during pregnancy are rough on a woman's body and mind.

In my case added tests, stress tests, genetic tests, checking lakes of blood in placenta, steroid shots, checking the cyst on one sons brain. Throwing up so bad u loose weight and have to be put on meds. I mean I could go on forever but most importantly they are perfect and healthy in the end after tons of tears, work, bed rest, and appointments. So yes it is no picnic to bring these beautiful babies into the world. I will say though some women abuse the pregnancy card. I never asked for anything or complained through all my difficulties and was just so happy I got my children. Most ppl freaked when someone would say everything I went through bc I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside of spouse, parents, and siblings that I was dealing with any of it. My SIL never had one issue. Yet she showed up late to everything saying pregnant here hormones and was crying for no reason lol. I\u2019m talking holding dinner by 3 hours when 2 months pregnant. If anyone tried to talk about anything else she\u2019d just get loud and talk about being pregnant. Told us my husbands aunt wondered if my son would be jealous he wasn\u2019t the baby anymore but aunt never said that at all. Not to mention he\u2019s still the baby on my side not that it matters. Some women just want to be center of attention and everything about them. She made up issues for her pregnancy that BIL took off work and went to and found out weren\u2019t true.

And take this as advice from an older husband and father and step-father and one who has already put one child to rest, unless you backtrack and do some emergency repair, it's going to seriously hurt your marriage. If she gets to the birthdate and still has the feelings that you aren't supporting and comforting her, she's going to have a living reminder for the rest of her life that you weren't there when she needed you most. \n\nIT IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT that your wife and mother of your child feels supported and comforted during this life changing immensely scary part of her life. \n\nMy wife worked as a labor and delivery nurse for a decade and one of the major failings of our country (assuming USA) is that we have grossly ill-prepared women for pregnancy. If she follows the statistics (which are scary), she most likely has never witnessed a childbirth and even less likely to have witnessed a death in childbirth. And believe it or not, death is something at childbirth that happens. More often than not to those with difficult pregnancies. Gestational diabetes, eclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities, etc ... So she's going into a CRAZY biological process having learned nothing firsthand about childbirth. One in which she, or YOUR child may die, and she's past the point of an early exit ramp. \n\nImagine for a moment the amount of stress that places her under, and I guarantee you she's thinking about it. Every minute of her day, and most likely her dreams as well. Imagine how you would feel if you knew that you could be dead in a few months time. She NEEDS your support. I hope you can give it to her. \n\nP.S. my wife and I are real big on women's medical rights during childbirth. OB docs these days perform many unnecessary procedures to make their work-life balance better (c sections, inductions, episiotomy, etc...).

I wish people on this sub would acknowledge that the partner of someone pregnant can get emotionally burnt out as well. We get that she is pregnant and it is difficult, but that doesn't mean the partner isn't going through stuff as well. It's not to say that he is having a harder time than her. The AH part is telling her that shes having a pity Olympics, because ironically from your post, you are a competitor as well. Your response would discourage her from opening up, therefore distant. I most likely not to even punish you but because she feels like she will be brushed off.\n\nYour partner is is growing another human that you will have to stress over in the future and having your body staging a revolt against you is a valid reason to complain in my opinion. I would apologize for your comments and then try to communicate with each other. You are most likely your wife's only outlet so she depends on you. It OK to be mentally overwhelmed or burnt out, but don't take it out on your partner. Also communicate that your are stressed without seeming like your are competing. \n\n>I'm a pretty cheerful person normally, and I absolutely hate hearing people complain constantly because it really brings me down. I'm pretty sure I'm going to crack any second, so I wanted to put an end to this complaining since I just need some light in my life.\n\nI also wanted to address this quote. There is a difference between complaining and venting and it is important to recognize the difference. Your wife is venting and I believe some of your stress may be relieved if you also vented to a family member or friend.  It's ok to vent  to prevent things from bottling up. If you are interacting with other humans, especially in a work environment, all the annoyances can pile up while your social battery is being drained. An outlet is needed and at the moment your wife needs you to release the pressure. I will state again that you are also allowed to relieve the pressure.\n\nP.S.

A cheerful person is someone that remains cheerful regardless of their surroundings. They cheer up people with their personality and presence.

YTA, and you owe your wife an apology.", "YTA, you want to win the suffering competition because your wife is complaining about pain, nausea, insomnia, heartburn, muscle spasms, crushed bladder, carpal tunnel, high blood pressure, back pain, fluid retention.... anything else? \n\nShe's going through all that and it's hard on you because you have to HEAR about it?", "YTA. She\u2019s growing your baby, it can reaaaaaally suck, and sounds like this one is giving he hell.

You aren't anymore.", "YTA, have some compassion", "Only read the title: YTA", "This. \n\nOP, you're being extremely self centered. This is the easy part right now, you really should seek out therapy to help you cope. \n\nJust because women CAN carry children does not mean that it comes natural and is easy. Her body is being completely re-arranged right now, and with a difficult pregnancy shes trying to monitor her condition.\n\nWhich if you cared for her at all you would listen. If she ends up in the hospital, you need to know what her symptoms have been and worst case scenario you need to speak on her behalf. \n\nAlso it can be really hard to know when to go to the ER, what's normal vs an emergency. That can be a difference between life and death for her and the baby right now. \n\nThere is a real possibility that she might downplay her symptoms or not go to the ER right away because she doesnt want to bother you. THAT could be life or death depending on how serious her complications are. \n\nSo sorry you had to work more hours, but she is literally putting her life on the line to bring YOUR protege into the world.", "This!   \nOP just made her complicated pregnancy MORE complicated taking away what she viewed as her support, esp if she doesn't have an amazing support system!", "Imo this is the best comment here. OP is a MESS. He\u2019s seriously so self-centered. I feel awful for his wife. And uh OP apparently is unable to regulate his emotions when others complain\u2026 and is having a child?? I\u2019m sorry I laughed out loud. Also: obviously pregnancy has a lot of ups and downs for men too, but if he\u2019s burnt out already, maybe he needs to work less and have more time available to prepare for this and to be there for his wife?\n\nYTA OP. Please listen to this person and take their advice to heart. You need to be doing something differently here.", "The fact OP is now sulking because their wife is \u2018distant\u2019 really takes the cake.

Then he all sad she doesn\u2019t just go back to being her bubbly self.", "Also, the pity olympics? He thinks her discomfort at being pregnant (I'm assuming she's probably in her third trimester since he says she's been pregnant for a while) is some kind of game or competition to her?\n\nI can't stand people like OP who lack any sympathy, it's even worse than people who do actually make a competition about complaining (like oh you have this bad thing going on? I've got it even worse). Just offer a kind ear to your wife and rub her feet, OP. If you can't stand hearing people complain, what are you going to do when your kid turns four and goes through a phase where they whine over everything?", "There is not enough room on reddit to say everything I want to say to OP. So just...\n\nLolllll YTA. Jesus.", "I am currently pregnant. Have been for a while. In my 9th month. I have complained often. I have cried out of the physical pain of carrying a baby. I have had mood swings. I have felt low due to my body not feeling like it was before. I have complained feeling ugly and fat. Well, the list goes on.\n\nThe point is: pregnancy is hard. Specially if you are a first time mom; all of it is new. Days can be legit difficult. My husband has been so patient in supporting me all thru this. \n\nIf he had said to me what you said to your wife, I would have been extremely upset and disappointed in him. I would have felt all alone in this difficult journey. \n\nYou are a big AH. You are not dealing with the physical repercussions of being pregnant. Grow up, be a man and support your wife in a positive way.", "imagine op with a moody teenager. teenagers are notoriously negative and you will have to deal with that till theyre done with puberty without snapping.", "Absolutely. This. YTA.", "At least the wife has some experience dealing with it", "That was my first thought. What happens when he\u2019s decided the baby is being a baby & should just suck it up cuz other babies have it worse?", "He\u2019s in this situation bc of the \ud83c\udf46. Good lord, he\u2019s going to be a terrible father.", "I wish I still thought that highly of humanity.", "She's dealing with complications in the pregnancy and he told her not to play the pity olympics or whine, this was not a neutral 'I'm tired and I need you to lighten up' conversation he was shaming her for complaining about her situation and then goes as far as to say he's the one with the short end of the stick while dealing with the pregnancy not her.\n\nI do think his stress ulcer and lack of sleep isn't being taken into account as much as it should be but he is extremely cruel to his wife here and I think that's overriding it for a lot of people", "I think you have some good points, that some people can abuse their cards. But even though you went through something extremely difficult (glad it went well though!) doesn\u2019t mean everyone is going to have the same response. OP\u2019s spouse is going through something difficult and has the right to vent her worries to her SPOUSE who should have been fully prepared for what was coming. Yes, it is going to be hard on him. Does that invalidate him? No. Does it mean he\u2019s not going through some intense emotion? No. But his response and how he said it was what made him TA.", "Exactly. And he\u2019s going to be even more petulant when the baby is here!!!", "It\u2019s the crux of why his take is so awful. This reads like one of those 1950s guidebooks for housewives, telling them to run a comb through their hair and put on a big smile to greet hubby as he comes home from his VERY demanding 9-5 workday of drinking gin at his desk and chatting up the office ladies.", "My immediate thought was \u201cthis dude has no clue how far along his wife is, does he?\u201d", "Maybe his wife is an elephant.", "Like, couldn\u2019t she hurry it up or something\u2026?", "Perhaps he's Prince Harry?!", "But you don\u2019t understand, he wants it to be all sunshine and rainbows! Why can\u2019t she just be happy all the time, doesn\u2019t she know how hard this pregnancy has been on him? He\u2019s a cheerful person, which means never having to hear a negative thing ever because it stresses him the FUCK out! \n\nHe just wants his wife back! She\u2019s been noticeably distant; what\u2019s wrong with her? Couldn\u2019t be him, right? \n\n(/s in case it wasn\u2019t abundantly clear)\n\nOP, this problem will NOT get better after the baby\u2019s here. You need to step the fuck up because your wife\u2019s going to need you.", "Pregnancy is the fucking worst, too.  At the end you are so exhausted but you\u2019re so uncomfortable and your bladder is so small that you can barely sleep.  To say nothing of the months of nausea and superhuman ability to smell every disgusting odor within 500 yards. OH BUT OP IS TIRED.", "Lol my son is 16... Send help! On the upside, my daughter is almost 19 and we survived that so, fingers crossed!", "Hey OP. I'm not going to say you're getting the short end of the stick, but as a pregnant person, I do really empathize with your position. \n\nDoes your wife have any friends, family, a therapist, etc. who she talks with about her pregnancy? \n\nShe's putting a lot on you, and it's reasonable to not be able to be someone's sole support during particularly trying times. That's not healthy for either of you. She needs to find more support right now. (This will help when the baby comes, too.)\n\nAnd? This thing you did, where you kept things building up until you snapped, is also not helpful or healthy. You need to learn how to broach these conversations sooner and set reasonable boundaries. For example, it's totally reasonable to say, \"I can be here for you, but I need to sleep. Let's talk during the day. I am going to bed now.\" \n\nBoth of you need to figure out together how you can put your oxygen mask on, so to speak, while helping her with hers.", "Sorry but if your wife\u2019s complaining is stressing you out this much do you really think you are cut out to be a father? \n\nYou do realize that being a parent is literally worrying all the time about how your child is eating, their health, being a therapist, ect... what exactly do you think you\u2019re signing up for?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019ve seen videos; it\u2019s wild. Poor lungs. They get so smushed!", "And nobody talks about it! Before you get pregnant you hear about morning sickness and needing to pee but that's it. I'm pregnant now, too. I'm 40 weeks, so the end is in sight. This has been 9 months of heart burn, nausea, insomnia, round ligament pain, pelvic girdle pain.... the list goes on and on. The pelvic pain is one of the most excruciating things I've ever experienced. I can't turn over in bed or get out of a chair without searing pain that feels like my pelvis is being ripped apart. No one talks about it, because if they did no one in their right mind would voluntarily go through it. And all of this while still having to pretty much function as usual in our day to day lives, because none of this is considered debilitating enough to warrant special consideration. It's all just par for the course. Our doctors are just like \"yeah sorry that sucks, you just kind of have to deal with it.\" Can't even take most medicines to help with any of it. My OB straight up said about my PGP that \"it's the sort of pain that ibuprofen helps with, but you can't take that.\" Tylenol doesn't touch this kind of pain, and that's the only thing we're allowed to take. Literally just have to continue going about my life in some of the worst pain I've ever experienced until this baby comes out. Physical therapy helps a little. Factor in all the unsolicited advice, opinions, and judgements - plus the hatefulness of people who say stuff like \"maybe you should have thought of that before you spread your legs\" if you dare to say that standing up on the bus while heavily pregnant is hard and dangerous... the entire experience is just full of difficulties even if it's an \"easy\" pregnancy. Thank god I haven't had complications like gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia or complete placenta previa. Or heaven forbid not having access to healthcare. If my husband reacted like this jackass when I complain about any of this, I would lose my shit.", "Dude. She\u2019s growing a fucking human. That you put in her. You think she misses being comfortable and not hormonal?", "Other people have it worse, bud \n\nyta", "Dude, small spaces don\u2019t really have much to do with it. Lot of couples live in a lot smaller I\u2019m sure and aren\u2019t this unsupportive. \n\nIf you need a bit of time to yourself say that instead of snapping. But you even admit this pregnancy has been hard on her and you\u2019re upset she\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows.", "well buddy ure in it for life", "This isn't the pity olympics, man. Plenty of people have it worse than you. Be lucky you have a place to live and a wife (for now, anyway) who loves you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, it's really annoying to hear, isn't it? Do better by your wife.", "Then why are you having a baby?", "and you're adding a baby...why?", "Take a fucking walk around the block then, dude. Drive to your family\u2019s house. Go to lunch with a friend and bring something back for her. These are solvable problems, my dude. You\u2019re sitting here whining about them on the Internet and to your wife who\u2019s in the midst of a difficult pregnancy and it is just impossible to feel bad for you. Again, you have *one* job. One goddamn job, and it\u2019s to support your wife. No one is buying these bullshit theatrics.", "Honestly dude you're not ready to be a dad. Not with that attitude, it's disgusting. I feel so bad for that baby and your wife.", "What did you think you were signing up for?!", "Why why WHY would you ever bring a baby into this?!", "Oh boy let me tell you what happens when you introduce a whole ass baby into the mix.", "Do you have any idea how much worse this is going to get when you add a loud, tiny, needy baby to this? YTA I pity your wife, grow up", "I just want to give you some insight: my son turns 4 soon. I've been away from him less than 30 total days since he was born. Even if you're okay with the baby being watched regular by others like my sister, her son is 9 months and she's not spent more than 40 total days away from him and that's only because she's been renovating a house and he can't be in there with the drywall dust and saw dust and such. In the meantime she's literally raised him in a studio apartment with her husband and their 2 dogs.", "I don't think he meant to be cruel though. It's sounds like he just snapped at her out of sheer exhaustion and burn out. Not ok but understandable.", "I totally get that every experience is different and everyone deals differently. I  just feel OP is not articulating it right. I know my husband constantly worried, had my back, and wanted everything right. He is a super positive person also. She should be able to vent completely!!! Yet if someone is constantly trying to help you, back you, love you, and support you yet hear nothing positive from you? Especially someone who is super positive and wants you happy. They feel defeated depressed and like they haven\u2019t helped at all. But if that isn\u2019t the case then he\u2019s just a complete AH I was trying to give benefit of doubt after going through hard pregnancies myself and everyone jumps to AH on here with no one articulating correctly the first time lol.", "The more I read your comments, the clearer it gets that this baby is going to be the end of your relationship.. looks like youre not ready to be a father at all if youve already reached your breaking point", "That would make taking her for drives more challenging. It would also explain why he does not trust her to manage her own diet and exercise. And that would make the apartment feel smaller. Yiu are on ti something!", "You beat me to it! \ud83d\ude06", "Or hire another project manager. Those are best to know how 9 women can deliver a baby in just a month.", "Just because women CAN carry children does not mean that it comes natural and is easy.", "I can't believe how miserable I was towards the end of my pregnancy. And I had an easier pregnancy than most. No nausea or other rough symptoms, but at the end...MY GOD. The level of discomfort my own body was putting me through...not to mention the stress of actually having my first baby and stressing over impending motherhood. I couldn't get comfortable to sleep or even just sit there and breathe. All that while I still had plenty of weeks to go. Like, was I supposed to keep that to myself according to OP? That's so sad for his wife.", "I really really hope that she's talking to a lawyer rn.", "For me stomach hurt the most. Always hungry, but not enough room. By 7 months inwas eating every 30 min, took me 2 hours to finish a regular meal.", "I hope you have a safe delivery, and healthy baby \u2764\ufe0f", "If she\u2019s breastfeeding she has even longer of her body not being her own.", "I get what you mean but from his summary of events, I don't think he's really reflecting on his cruelty, though maybe not considering he bothered to make an AITA. Just, the 'why is she being distant' reaction when he told her off for playing the pity olympics is... hm, there's a vibe where he's being kinda self righteous 'she's the problem not me' . \n\nI do agree though that's why I gave a NAH rating in my own comment. I just think he's being unrealistic when he thinks she should just stop complaining completely and be positive for him when she's... in constant discomfort, probs can't take pain medication because you can't take many of them when pregnant and there's complications in the pregnancy. Like yes it's draining to listen to complaints and yes he snapped at her out of tiredness rather than just asking her to ease back, but I think from his summary. He genuinely expects her to just give him closeness without venting to him anymore. Which is ... not great.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from and why you think that way. I think I what I really meant was how he didn\u2019t really communicate. But you do have excellent points! Maybe he really did/does feel like he wasn\u2019t enough, like he should have been doing more and neglected himself. But in doing so, he neglected to tell his spouse how he felt which led to this. But thanks for telling me that, I didn\u2019t really think about that part lol", "Do you want a caregiver comparison like you want comparisons for your wife? My husband has had to deal with me having multiple disabling immune conditions and cancer and then as of last August 2 separate catastrophic injuries that mean he must do everything. Including still even bringing me all my food and drinks and we just got past catheters and bedside commodes. Btw he never even cooked before I got hurt. He also has to take care of 4 cats, a dog, finances, an acreage property with old trees that keep falling down, and a host of other stuff. I'm literally trapped in his recliner except to hobble to the bathroom a couple times a day. For months he also had to help with that even pulling my pants up and down and wiping. So compare away if you think her concerns aren't valid because others have it worse. My husband has it far worse than you yet I still think you deserve some empathy because it is obviously difficult for you. However just as you don't want to compare don't do it to her and do set aside a little time that is solely for you to recharge barring major issues. My husband will take like 2 hours where beforehand he makes sure I have food and drinks and have gone potty and don't need anything from him and just do something, still at the house, for himself. Last week it was just riding his motorcycle around the block for an hour. It helped recharge him. We've also looked into things that are easier to prepare food wise, meal kits might help you with that. Just show empathy as well as demanding it. I guarantee it is more difficult for her. I take over 40 different daily medications just to barely function and am so grateful for everything.", "Oof. I already have enough issue with that. I\u2019ve been trying to conceive for a while, I\u2019m a bit afraid of how much worse pain and stomach issues will be.", "Thank you!", "Amen. From 2015-2019 I was either pregnant or breastfeeding. Stopped nursing one at 9 months because I wanted my body back... Juiuust to end up pregnant again lol", "Well, he also says that she expects him to be with her every single second he isn't working and unless she's on complete best rest, that's ridiculous. I think that he should see if a friend or relative can take her on a spa day or something for a few hours to give them both a break. No one can be \"on\" 24/7 and I don't think their relationship will survive if the poor guy doesn't get a break.", "She\u2019s growing your kid inside of her body, dude.
