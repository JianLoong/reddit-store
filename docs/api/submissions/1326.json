For privacy, let's call her Sophie.\n\n*Me: Hey Sophie! What's up? I'm shocked you called!*\n\n*Sophie: Hey \\*my name\\*! I was thinking we haven't done anything together, and we should bond more!*\n\n*Me: That sounds like an amazing idea! Do you wanna go to the movies or the mall together?*\n\n*Sophie: Actually, I was thinking we could go to the Taylor Swift concert together! It will be fun!*\n\n*Me: That does sound like a lot of fun, but it's probably gonna cost a lot of money. (I work a job that pays $18 an hour)*\n\n*Sophie: Don't worry! We can split the cost!*\n\n*Me: Ok, I will think about it and I will get back to you!*\n\nThe call ended, and I checked my calendar. I was free that day. I would love to go, so I decided to check with her parents first. I call her mom and she says that she told Sophie no this morning, because she has bad grades in school right now, and she doesn't want me to take her unless she gets her grades up. I totally understand this because her parents want her to learn that she doesn't get rewarded for poor grades/behavior, and she can't just ask other people/family members/friends when her parents say no. I say I understand, and hang up.\n\nFast forward to 2 hours ago, she texts me:\n\n*Sophie: Hey, did you find out about Taylor Swift from my parents yet?*\n\n*Me: I'm sorry to tell you this but, they said no.*\n\n*Sophie: WHAT!? WHY!?*\n\n*Me: Well, your parents said you weren't doing the best in school right now, and you have to get your grades up. I don't have a lot of money right now either.* \n\n*Sophie: YOU PROMISED THO! IM NEVER TALKING TO YOU AGAIN!*\n\n*\\*blocks my number\\**\n\nI feel kinda bad, but also bummed I was her 4th choice to bring her to the concert. But I was just doing what her parents said.

You did fine.", "NTA - but did you expect you were her first choice given how you aren't close?", "There is no world you\u2019d be the AH in here. You know that.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if I were you, I wouldn't spend a lot of time trying to make up with her.  She's an entitled, manipulative brat. Hopefully it is a phase she will outgrow but for now, you don't need that kind of drama.", "Lol, no, not the AH.  Oh to be 13 again...", "NTA. This is a kid being a moody teenager. They will get over it. You could always invite her over to listen or watch some t swift if you want to extend an olive branch!", "Nta. You\u2019d be an asshole if you rewarded this behaviour", "NTA lol she tried to manipulate people around her to get what she wanted and got told no. You would be the AH if you went against her parents\u2019 wishes, not hers.", "NTA. I think how you responded to her was very nice especially considering how blatantly she was trying to manipulate you. Hopefully this will be a good learning experience for her.", "Tickets for T-Swift haven\u2019t gone on sale yet and she\u2019s acting like an entitled brat assuming that she\u2019s entitled to tickets when so many people are going to be fighting to buy them and they\u2019re likely going to cost hundreds of dollars. NTA", "This girl is special.\n\nNTA", "NTA, she was just trying to get tickets out of you! And she is trying to manipulate you saying yhat you promised which she should understand is contingent upon parental approval as you are a minor and have no say. I would let het parents know about her behavior. She already blocked you so you dont have anything to lose.", "Nta", "NTA, sounds to me like she was just using you anyway.  She has a lot of growing up to do, and honestly sounds kind of bratty, blocking you.", "NTA. Little cousin was trying to be conniving but isn\u2019t very good at it. She should (to be successful at conniving) have told her parents you called and *invited* her to the concert. You were smart to check with her parents.", "NTA. Her parents said no. Are you supposed to kidnap a 13 year old girl and take her to a concert?   \nI would say the attitude you're getting is just because of her age. Everything is unfair and the end of the world at that age. She'll get over it eventually. I would encourage her parents to talk to her about it.", "NTA", "Typical middle school teen move, trying to get their way any way they can. Parents said no, so she tried to find another way, that being you. You are only as important as what you can give. You said no, so goodbye relationship for now.\n\nBut don't worry, she might mature eventually and want to have an actual true relationship with you, no strings attached.\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: I am proud of her parents for not enabling her. With parents like those, she has a chance to change into a decent adult. So many entitled spoiled kids being raised these days.", "She's being a typical 13yr old who's throwing ba tantrum because she's not getting her way, pay it no mind, NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
