For context, we never really talk because we have a 5 year age difference, and the only time we see each other is on holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.) I have her number in my cell phone, and today I receive a call from her that went like this. For privacy, let's call her Sophie.\n\n*Me: Hey Sophie! What's up? I'm shocked you called!*\n\n*Sophie: Hey \\*my name\\*! I was thinking we haven't done anything together, and we should bond more!*\n\n*Me: That sounds like an amazing idea! Do you wanna go to the movies or the mall together?*\n\n*Sophie: Actually, I was thinking we could go to the Taylor Swift concert together! It will be fun!*\n\n*Me: That does sound like a lot of fun, but it's probably gonna cost a lot of money. (I work a job that pays $18 an hour)*\n\n*Sophie: Don't worry! We can split the cost!*\n\n*Me: Ok, I will think about it and I will get back to you!*\n\nThe call ended, and I checked my calendar. I was free that day. I would love to go, so I decided to check with her parents first. I call her mom and she says that she told Sophie no this morning, because she has bad grades in school right now, and she doesn't want me to take her unless she gets her grades up. I totally understand this because her parents want her to learn that she doesn't get rewarded for poor grades/behavior, and she can't just ask other people/family members/friends when her parents say no. I say I understand, and hang up.\n\nFast forward to 2 hours ago, she texts me:\n\n*Sophie: Hey, did you find out about Taylor Swift from my parents yet?*\n\n*Me: I'm sorry to tell you this but, they said no.*\n\n*Sophie: WHAT!? WHY!?*\n\n*Me: Well, your parents said you weren't doing the best in school right now, and you have to get your grades up. I don't have a lot of money right now either.* \n\n*Sophie: YOU PROMISED THO! IM NEVER TALKING TO YOU AGAIN!*\n\n*\\*blocks my number\\**\n\nI feel kinda bad, but also bummed I was her 4th choice to bring her to the concert. But I was just doing what her parents said.

You did fine.", "NTA - but did you expect you were her first choice given how you aren't close?", "There is no world you\u2019d be the AH in here. You know that.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if I were you, I wouldn't spend a lot of time trying to make up with her.  She's an entitled, manipulative brat. Hopefully it is a phase she will outgrow but for now, you don't need that kind of drama.", "Lol, no, not the AH.  Oh to be 13 again...", "NTA. This is a kid being a moody teenager. They will get over it. You could always invite her over to listen or watch some t swift if you want to extend an olive branch!", "Nta. You\u2019d be an asshole if you rewarded this behaviour", "NTA lol she tried to manipulate people around her to get what she wanted and got told no. You would be the AH if you went against her parents\u2019 wishes, not hers.", "NTA. I think how you responded to her was very nice especially considering how blatantly she was trying to manipulate you. Hopefully this will be a good learning experience for her.", "Tickets for T-Swift haven\u2019t gone on sale yet and she\u2019s acting like an entitled brat assuming that she\u2019s entitled to tickets when so many people are going to be fighting to buy them and they\u2019re likely going to cost hundreds of dollars. NTA", "This girl is special.\n\nNTA", "NTA, she was just trying to get tickets out of you! And she is trying to manipulate you saying yhat you promised which she should understand is contingent upon parental approval as you are a minor and have no say. I would let het parents know about her behavior. She already blocked you so you dont have anything to lose.", "Nta", "NTA, sounds to me like she was just using you anyway.  She has a lot of growing up to do, and honestly sounds kind of bratty, blocking you.", "NTA. Little cousin was trying to be conniving but isn\u2019t very good at it. She should (to be successful at conniving) have told her parents you called and *invited* her to the concert. You were smart to check with her parents.", "NTA. Her parents said no. Are you supposed to kidnap a 13 year old girl and take her to a concert?   \nI would say the attitude you're getting is just because of her age. Everything is unfair and the end of the world at that age. She'll get over it eventually. I would encourage her parents to talk to her about it.", "NTA", "Typical middle school teen move, trying to get their way any way they can. Parents said no, so she tried to find another way, that being you. You are only as important as what you can give. You said no, so goodbye relationship for now.\n\nBut don't worry, she might mature eventually and want to have an actual true relationship with you, no strings attached.\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: I am proud of her parents for not enabling her. With parents like those, she has a chance to change into a decent adult.

Also, even if you went to the concert together, you're not obligated to pay for her ticket.", "oh, come on, you know you\u2019re not the AH here. you would be an AH if you took a 13-year-old somewhere without parental permission. it\u2019s not like you had another option.", "NTA. She was trying to use you.", "NTA \n\nSounds like a typical, manipulative 13 yr old. She even altered the conversation to fit her narrative, lol. Don't sweat it.

My mom, sister, and I all registered for verified fan and still no guarantee any of us will be able to get 3 tickets", "NTA  Sophie is a brat though.  She's trying to get someone to go against her parents.", "NTA. I will straight up laugh in the face of anyone who accuses me of promising anything to them. I take promises very seriously, so i rarely make them. I\u2019ve only made one promise to a family member since my wedding day over 20 years ago. And can\u2019t remember making any before then.", "NTA and I suspect that Sophie doesn't have any money and expected you to buy the tickets.  And since she'd already been told 'no' by her parents, I don't know why she thought asking you (or anyone else) would have changed the outcome.", "You didn't promise anything. You said you'd think about it and get back to her, which you did. She didn't get the answer she liked and then behaved like a (somewhat) typical 13-year old. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your cousin tried to use you to get her way after her parents said no. Manipulative little brat haha.", "NTA.  She is being immature and that is just more evidence she doesn't need to be rewarded for her behavior.", "NTA\n\nOne day, Sophie will realize that she isn't doing *anything* without her parents' permission. Apparently, that day is not today. She's TA for blaming that on you, but the attempt seems like pretty normal 13yo behavior.", "Nta", "You got played by a 13-year-old.  You are naive, but NTA.  She will hate you for a while, until she wants something else.  She already knew her parents answer, but decided to make you the bad guy, when all she really had to do was bring up her grades...", "I love the way she generously offered to split the cost of the concert she wanted to go to.", "NTA she was obviously just trying to use you to dodge parents saying no :)", "1. You didn't make a promise. You said you would consider it.\n\n2. She lied by omission by not telling you that her parents said no.\n\nYou handled this exactly the right way. And dont worry, this is just a 13 year old throwing a tantrum for not getting her way. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t overrule her parents and yes she does need to get her grades up. She\u2019s 13. Hopefully this will motivate her more too and she\u2019ll see Taylor in concert one day.", "NTA, I don't know why you're bummed, because what you clarified was that she is a child who had already gotten to know from her parents, and was trying to circumvent them by dragging you in.\n\nShe literally didn't care about going to this concert with you, she was just looking for someone to finance her disrespecting her parents and getting what she wanted. You should block her on your end so that the next time she decides to start drama, you are not involved.", "NTA  \nYour cousin is trying to manipulate you.  Good for you for checking with her parents first and not giving into a 13 year old tantrum.", "NTA\u2014- she\u2019s just trying to avoid being punished to get what she wants. Her parents said no, so it\u2019s definitely a no on going to the concert. Don\u2019t feel bad about it.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to buy anyone\u2019s concert tickets. Her parents said she couldn\u2019t go. She\u2019s being an immature brat hanging up and saying she\u2019ll never talk to you again.", "NTA", "NTA", "Honestly that\u2019s a little outside typical 13-year-old, she sounds bratty af", "Disagree save those texts and in 5 years show them to her, you\u2019ll both laugh. \n\nNTA", "LMAO FR", "doesn\u2019t sound like they do know that. OP is still pretty young themselves", "damn.", "love ur answer lmao", "She was clearly trying to use you to get the tickets because her parents said no, that\u2019s manipulative and you can totally ignore her", "Seriously, a lot of people come on here and dismiss bad children's behavior cuz they don't know what is developmentally normal. This is an average behavior, the cousin is a young asshole", "NTA.  You did the right thing by checking with the parents first.", "im 18", "Thanks! People can be crazy.", "I\u2019m also side eyeing her suggestion to \u201csplit the cost\u201d.\n\nFirst of all if they are buying two tickets, and splitting it\u2026the OP is just paying for a ticket to a Taylor swift concert.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure Taylor swift concert tickets are like *crazy * expensive. I highly doubt a 13 year old has that kind of money saved up. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s possible, especially depending on how high her allowance is and how committed she is to going to one of her concerts. But I can\u2019t help but think she personally just said that to sell OP on the idea.", "The pricing supposedly starts at $49 (probably for nosebleed seats), but those are going to go quickly. I also believe the platform she uses, Ticketmaster, is going to use dynamic pricing which means the price depends on the demand... so yeah, those tickets are going to be pricey. \n\nMy guess is that splitting the cost would turn into OP paying upfront for both tickets, with the cousin promising to pay her back and never actually doing so.", "But honestly, would that even matter? If someone blocks you on their end, they have the ability to undo that. It's just a gesture of her saying that she doesn't want to talk to you and framing it like it's a punishment so that she doesn't have to respond to anything you say. The next time she wants to play games she can very easily unblock you"]}
