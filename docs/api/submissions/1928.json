I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I understand the confusion about how strict we were with her little sister. I admit that her sister was given more freedom when it comes to social life. She was allowed to hang out with her friends outside of school more than her older sister. When it comes to school and grades we were as strict, but my youngest did better in highschool than her older sister. Thats also why my youngest was allowed to go out more and we would not let the oldest go out either as punishment or because we felt she needed to study more.

You don't get to claim that the disease, rather than the punch, was responsible for the severity of the injury and its consequences.\n\nThough this isn't a legal matter, a similar kind of thing is at play here.  It does not matter if she's just naturally more prone to depression or whatever.\n\nYou abused her.  Her supposed fragility is absolutely fucking irrelevant to your culpability here.

Stop that part. Unless you are still pressuring her to be the best, or judging her if she isn't, or thinking her succeeding reflects on your or will benefit you... just stop that. High degrees does NOT equal high quality life, and while I think she needs therapy, I think hearing that from you will come as another slap, so just tell her you love her no matter what and are sorry you put so much pressure on her when you thought that was the only way to survive. Don't put pressure on her anymore, don't blame her, don't compare her to her sister or anyone, don't judge her or ask her why she's like that (she is 100% like that because the people who were supposed to love her IGNORED her for weeks not because she was bad, but because she wasn't perfect), and do NOT tell her what she needs to do anymore, or else in the present you would still be TA.

I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Oof. You\u2019re gonna sleep real good tonight after reading all these comments and (hopefully but this is probably wishful thinking) starting to come to terms with how awful of a parent you\u2019ve been and are continuing to be, I bet\u2026oh, and YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAs a woman with depression who was raised similarly to your daughter, it is really hard for me to come to grips with your justification.\n\nHere's another POV; I am the oldest and much like your younger daughter, I came out \"okay\" while my brother was the one who acted out.  It still didn't stop the trauma.  It didn't change the past; I wasn't okay because of my childhood.  I was okay in *SPITE* of my childhood.  \n\nThe whole earning approval and love?  Oh I felt that.  I LIVED that.\n\nSo make no mistake; your younger daughter might be coping a little more resiliently that your eldest, but she is suffering all the same and because of your and your husbands treatment.   They react differently but they are suffering from trauma.\n\nI should've stood by my brother when he pointed out to my parents how much pain they had put us through.  I wish that I didn't bottle it all inside until eventually the dam broke.  I'm not gonna say that childhood trauma definitely caused your daughter's depression but it sounds like you are trying to minimize her response to your actions because of her younger sister reacting differently and that is not fair to either of them.", "One mom to another, YTA for so many reasons.  You mentally and emotionally abused your daughter,  who she is now is who you shaped her to be.  Yes some people can take more abuse than others but that in no way makes any of her problems her fault. I was a horrible mother to my middle child and they are now very mentally scarred because of it. I did the same thing you are doing,  deflecting blame back onto them rather than accepting that I was 100% at fault.  One year ago I stood in a hospital and watched doctors fight to save my child. I got a second chance I didn't deserve to be a better mom. I have managed to repair a lot of our relationship and we are now very close. I didn't deserve it but my child has forgiven me. DO BETTER! Say your sorry and mean it! Stop blaming her for your mistakes.", "YTA. You literally contradicted yourself. You said you weren\u2019t as tough on your younger daughter then go on to say you pushed your younger daughter the same way. \n\nAnd sorry, but this is all on you either way. Wtf kind of parent doesn\u2019t speak to a child for two weeks and make them eat alone stood in a kitchen? That\u2019s abuse. The nerve of putting any blame on your daughter is insane. You fucked up and she\u2019s paying the consequences for it.", "OMG. So so so YTA. And here is why.\nI am like your daughter, the elder one. And I have a younger sister. Our parents were not abusive in any way, but the pressure for being amazing, not just good was always there. It started out as just us being better than our classmates at everything we did, and it ended at toxic perfectionism, anxiety and depression, probably more for me, just a little less for my sister.\n\nThe reason why my younger sister did relatively better with handling her mental health is that the pressure was partly on me to set a good example for her. And later on, they realized how it was affecting me and did everything in their power to understand both of us and signed up to help our mental health in the right way.\n\nThey also went on to realize the mistakes they made and how much of my perfectionism comes from my dad and he is working on managing it together with me. \n\nCircumstances might have brought you to this state with your daughter, but by blaming her, when she is clearly seeking help, you are being delusional, cruel and it is no different from the abuse she already has been through. Get off that high horse and help her by getting her and YOURSELF therapy. Otherwise be prepared for her to go LC on your ass.", "YTA, you admit you weren\u2019t as hard on your younger daughter as you were with your elder daughter so you can\u2019t compare them. You abused her. She now has to struggle with the weight of that abuse. It will never be her fault that you abused her. It is not in her personality to be abused, it is in YOUR personality to be an abuser. Would your parents believe in PTSD? In postpartum depression and depression? Would they have called you a weak personality for succumbing to those things? Use your brain a bit here.", "Yta,  you are 100% an asshole.   You are what's wrong with people.   You are a prime example of Roe V. Wade shouldn't have been overturned in the U.S.A.", "YTA.  I think your whole family needs therapy. Your eldest daughter needs it to deal with the abuse you and your husband gave her. Your younger daughter may not be as vocal as your eldest was, but I can\u2019t imagine seeing this kind of behavior growing up that she didn\u2019t also suffer trauma. As for you and your husband, I think you guys need serious help. If you truly felt guilty, you wouldn\u2019t have said that to her. I see this as you trying to bargain your way out, to deflect responsibility to make yourself feel better. To let yourself feel like it isn\u2019t completely your fault when truly it is. Face the truth, and really from the bottom of your heart, apologize to your daughters for the past, and show them proof over time that you will change. If you don\u2019t try hard enough, you may not hear from them ever again when they\u2019ve truly had enough.", "YTA. There are never siblings who are raised exactly the same way.

My favorite part is where you admit your were harder on your oldest daughter and they say you treated your youngest the same way. \n\nYou were an abusive parent then and you're an abusive parent now.

Being unemployed, I had to beg my guidance counselor for leftover cafeteria food so my brother and I could eat. She\u2019s a single mom with a seven-day workweek. You think that gives her an excuse?\n\nWanting a better life for your children is no excuse for abusing them. When you withhold your love, your children will think they\u2019re not worthy of it, and they\u2019ll hate themselves.\n\nYou\u2019re despicable. I hope your children put you in a home and you die alone.", "If you wildly shoot a dozen arrows, some will miss the target and some will hit closer to the bullseye.

It\u2019s still 100% YOUR FAULT. \n\nI\u2019m truly sorry you were treated so horribly as a child. But you remember how it made you feel, and chose to make your kids suffer too. You CHOSE it. \n\nYTA, without even the slightest scrap of doubt.", "YTA - you yourself admitted that you were more strict with the older one (meaning you abused her more) yet you compare her to the younger one, saying that she turned out fine so it must be the older ones fault. Wow. I'm surprised she's still talking you.", "YTA", "I mean we could literally tell you that other ppl who fled their country lived normal lives and didn\u2019t treat their children like garbage. But no one does that bc they\u2019re caring enough to understand everyone has their own struggles.

YOU treated the eldest like crap so now she will have to deal with that for the rest of her life while she gets no comfort or any real apology bc you rather play the victim.", "YTA for the way you parented. But I also get that *most* parents are doing the best they can with the knowledge they have. You acknowledging you messed up is huge. So I give you some credit for that but have you apologized?

Some don\u2019t. Some have a lot. Some a little. BUT throwing that in her face also makes you an AH. If you want to help get therapy for all of you. What you did WAS traumatic for her. Period.

Your primary concern should be that your kids are happy. What is success to them, and fulfills them, may not be what you think is.

Which, honestly, is weird because you earlier made clear you know it wasn\u2019t right now.", "Wow. YTA. The blind spot of saying that your younger daughter was raised the same way, but doesn\u2019t have the same issues is astounding. First of all, your younger daughter may very well have those same issues but is afraid to share them with you because of how you treat your older daughter. Second of all, even if that isn\u2019t the case why are you blaming your daughter for how she turned out because of your bad parenting. It sounds like you want credit for taking accountability for your bad choices, but then you\u2019re trying to excuse and qualify it by saying that really it\u2019s her fault. Just from the little bit you shared, you treated her terribly. Her personality is what it is because of how she was raised. All you are doing is diminishing and devaluing your daughter struggles.  If you are truly sorry for how you treated her, then you will take true accountability for your actions without blaming your daughter, who was a child. All of this goes for her father too.  Just wow", "Yta. When you make excuses or don't own your own behavior, you are causing more damage still.

The fact that you\u2019re blaming her at all is horrific.\n\nYou need therapy OP.", "YTA \n\nMy parents raised my older sister and I the same - she has gone low contact with them because of how we were raised. \n\nI haven't - is that because there is something wrong with my sister or her personality - no it's because I am better at pushing that crap down and pretending it's ok - \n\nJust because one child acts like things are ok - that doesn't mean things are ok, it just means that child figured out a way to cope was to make it look like things were ok.", "You... did not talk to her for TWO WEEKS because she... didn't... excel at something? I think it's basic human empathy to never dismiss your child like that. Parental love should be unconditional of academic performance. Even when you're disappointed in her, you should NEVER make her feel she isn't loved. Big YTA", "YTA i hope she cuts you out of her life soon so that you stop hurting her", "Y\u2019all need family therapy.", "Right, but your younger daughter WASN'T raised the same way. She had more freedom, more privileges and less punishments. So... no, YTA.", "YTA for sure. You admit to not treating your youngest the same as your oldest then blame her 'personality' on why she has depression?? Nah honey, that's completely on you and your parenting. Glad you have some insight to realize you're the problem but do not blame any of this on her.", "\u201cI was more strict with her then her sister\u201d to then \u201c we raised your sister the same way so its your fault.\u201d Your the asshole. You ostracized her if she didn\u2019t meet your high expectations and even now still compare her to her sister. I\u2019m amazed tour child still has a relationship with you at all.", "So it is your daughter\u2019s fault that she got lousy abusive parents who destroyed her self-steem and make her think she was never good enough? and on top of that you had the nerve to compare her with her sister, pointing out, that the sister who had a little better upbringing, is better than her? Wow, what a horrible parent you are, I hope she goes no contact with you, abusive people.  YTA", "u/Willing-Survey7448, I just want to give you my wholehearted support on your journey (and a giant virtual hug if that is OK).\n\nMothers like OP, yours, and mine raise traumatized and broken people. It takes guts, courage, grit, determination, and a shitload of baggage, emotions and tears to start undoing that. Let alone the cost of the therapy. \n\nI am NC (no contact) with my mom, and I've never felt more peace and love since doing that. I still struggle with never feeling good enough, but I'm working on that, and a lot of other stuff.\n\nI say that as someone in her 40's and has only realized in the last 5-10 years that this is not normal.\n\nu/Momwithguilt196008, heed my warning. If you continue on your current path, you will lose your daughter, like my mom has. \n\nIf you don't want that, get therapy, work on your own issues, listen to your daughter & respect her journey. It won't be comfortable for you, but it isn't for your daughter either.\n\nFor the love of anything, stop blaming her and remove the word BUT from your vocabulary. Blame & excuses have no place in a sincere apology.  \n\nOwn your part in this.", "DING DING DING, we have a winner!!", "OP is like the poster-parent for the [missing missing reasons](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html).", "Seriously, she was borderline abusive to her kids and thinks their mental health problems is partially their fault. OP, your youngest sounds more academically gifted so you weren\u2019t as hard on her therefore she suffered less. Your eldest got the brunt of your actions. Maybe her depression is not fully rooted in your actions but you played a large role. A sincere apology is always going to be no strings attached. You attached string by saying \u201csorry but\u2026\u201d", "You already realise that your parenting badly affected your daughter, so why does your apology come with a \u2018yes, but\u2019?\n\nI know it\u2019s painful to take full responsibility, but that\u2019s what your daughter needs from you now - it\u2019s not too late to be the parent she needs you to be.", "The younger is coping better because she was abused far less.", "Being separated from the rest of the family during meals is SIGNIFICANT. This type of alienation is frequently a sign that MUCH worse is going on. \n\nI don\u2019t remember what case it was, but there is a criminal case where a mother did this exact thing and it was the very beginning. The child ended up being beaten to death by their mother and at least one sibling.", "For 2 fucking weeks. It would sure send a very clear message to the child that they HAD to have stellar grades or they would be treated worse than garbage.", "Exactly, kids pay attention. OP, YTA for what you did to your eldest daughter, your youngest, and probably their relationship together. You created a double standard and then wonder why they\u2019re so different? Wild.", "Holy fuck reading this post was like reading my life coming from my mother's mouth. I am the youngest daughter. I am not ok. I am visibly not as not ok as my older sister, who I saw kill herself to be worthy of my parent's love. She got crippling anxiety and is still to this day trying to please them. I left the continent. But I am NOT ok. The times I do speak to my mom, she simultaneously apologizes and blames me for it. Last time I was home, she spent 3 days sobbing and telling me how sorry she was, and the last day telling me that I didn't really have that bad of a childhood because they paid for me to go to summer camp and I deserved their abuse because I was an angry teen. Reading this made me need to go take a stress nap.", "Here is the thing I don\u2019t believe the younger sis isn\u2019t as insecure. I think she is hiding it", "How does a person forget what they wrote at the beginning of the post?\n\nYTA to the tenth power just for that.", "In the edit OP say that the younger sibling did better in school and had better grades. Well, yeah it makes sense that she'd try harder after watching the what the older sibling went through. OP is definitely TA.", "Not borderline. Actually abusive.", "After reading this, I Hurt For Your Daughter!!! YTA and Yes! You absolutely Owe her an Unconditional Apology!! ...... You admit what you did.... Now use your imagination to put yourself in Her Shoes??? How would you feel being treated that way?   Unsure if you can ever gain any type of meaningful relationship without OWNING what you have done.  I do hope your family can heal and find peace ....it begins with you.", "Are you okay right now? I understand how triggering reading this could be.", "YUP.  I was like WTF, what does OP mean her daughters were raised the same way, when she herself said they weren't!", "Older siblings generally fight for the younger siblings freedom as they\u2019re usually parentified to some degree. \n\nI was the youngest girl but my two older sisters fought for my freedoms with the extended family. Helped me get out more etc they didn\u2019t have that so much. Neither did my older cousins. The younger the sibling the more freedoms they had. I have 1 younger sibling and I pushed for his freedoms too.\n\nEdit to add. This is the case of my culture.", "I think you are probably right about that.", "Yeah, I'm sure she'd justify it with some mental gymnastics... \"oh I was just a bit less strict, but the girls were in fact raised the same way...\" like what??? SMH", "WOW - OP's edit makes her seem even worse if possible. STILL justifying why it was ok to treat elder daughter like crap compared to her younger sis. She'll never get it. SMH", "According to her edit, she means that she *would* have abused younger daughter just like the older one, except she didn't need to because younger daughter didn't suck.", "Agreed"]}
