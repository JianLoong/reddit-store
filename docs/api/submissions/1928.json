I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  I understand the confusion about how strict we were with her little sister. I admit that her sister was given more freedom when it comes to social life. She was allowed to hang out with her friends outside of school more than her older sister. When it comes to school and grades we were as strict, but my youngest did better in highschool than her older sister. Thats also why my youngest was allowed to go out more and we would not let the oldest go out either as punishment or because we felt she needed to study more.

Your **ABUSE** shaped her personality. She is 100% right. You did this to her, you made a broken adult who you convinced wasn't worthy of love.

You don't get to claim that the disease, rather than the punch, was responsible for the severity of the injury and its consequences.\n\nThough this isn't a legal matter, a similar kind of thing is at play here.  It does not matter if she's just naturally more prone to depression or whatever.\n\nYou abused her.  Her supposed fragility is absolutely fucking irrelevant to your culpability here.  And if she *is* a little fragile, you were very likely a huge contributor to that, an exacerbating factor.

You ignored her for two weeks because of her grades (that is really cruel and neglectful). Tell her you will love her whether she is the best or not, and that her self worth is not based on that. Tell her you were in survival mode and didn't think you could survive without being the best, and you are ashamed of what you did and wish you could take it back, and hope she can forgive you. Don't put the blame on her personality, you made mistakes which led to her being this way (so what if her sister, a different person, responded a bit differently), and ask her to forgive you too. \n\nAnd this needs to stop:\n\n>so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees\n\nIs it NOT important in the present that she get a high degree for a good life, it's up to HER what will provide her happiness and a good life, so saying that in the present tense is what you have to work on now. Stop that part. Unless you are still pressuring her to be the best, or judging her if she isn't, or thinking her succeeding reflects on your or will benefit you... just stop that. High degrees does NOT equal high quality life, and while I think she needs therapy, I think hearing that from you will come as another slap, so just tell her you love her no matter what and are sorry you put so much pressure on her when you thought that was the only way to survive. Don't put pressure on her anymore, don't blame her, don't compare her to her sister or anyone, don't judge her or ask her why she's like that (she is 100% like that because the people who were supposed to love her IGNORED her for weeks not because she was bad, but because she wasn't perfect), and do NOT tell her what she needs to do anymore, or else in the present you would still be TA.

I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Oof. You\u2019re gonna sleep real good tonight after reading all these comments and (hopefully but this is probably wishful thinking) starting to come to terms with how awful of a parent you\u2019ve been and are continuing to be, I bet\u2026oh, and YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAs a woman with depression who was raised similarly to your daughter, it is really hard for me to come to grips with your justification.\n\nHere's another POV; I am the oldest and much like your younger daughter, I came out \"okay\" while my brother was the one who acted out.  It still didn't stop the trauma.  It didn't change the past; I wasn't okay because of my childhood.  I was okay in *SPITE* of my childhood.  \n\nThe whole earning approval and love?  Oh I felt that.  I LIVED that.\n\nSo make no mistake; your younger daughter might be coping a little more resiliently that your eldest, but she is suffering all the same and because of your and your husbands treatment.   They react differently but they are suffering from trauma.\n\nI should've stood by my brother when he pointed out to my parents how much pain they had put us through.  I wish that I didn't bottle it all inside until eventually the dam broke.  I'm not gonna say that childhood trauma definitely caused your daughter's depression but it sounds like you are trying to minimize her response to your actions because of her younger sister reacting differently and that is not fair to either of them.", "One mom to another, YTA for so many reasons.  You mentally and emotionally abused your daughter,  who she is now is who you shaped her to be.  Yes some people can take more abuse than others but that in no way makes any of her problems her fault. I was a horrible mother to my middle child and they are now very mentally scarred because of it. I did the same thing you are doing,  deflecting blame back onto them rather than accepting that I was 100% at fault.  One year ago I stood in a hospital and watched doctors fight to save my child. I got a second chance I didn't deserve to be a better mom. I have managed to repair a lot of our relationship and we are now very close. I didn't deserve it but my child has forgiven me. DO BETTER! Say your sorry and mean it! Stop blaming her for your mistakes.", "YTA. You literally contradicted yourself. You said you weren\u2019t as tough on your younger daughter then go on to say you pushed your younger daughter the same way. \n\nAnd sorry, but this is all on you either way. Wtf kind of parent doesn\u2019t speak to a child for two weeks and make them eat alone stood in a kitchen? That\u2019s abuse. The nerve of putting any blame on your daughter is insane. You fucked up and she\u2019s paying the consequences for it.", "OMG. So so so YTA. And here is why.\nI am like your daughter, the elder one. And I have a younger sister. Our parents were not abusive in any way, but the pressure for being amazing, not just good was always there. It started out as just us being better than our classmates at everything we did, and it ended at toxic perfectionism, anxiety and depression, probably more for me, just a little less for my sister.\n\nThe reason why my younger sister did relatively better with handling her mental health is that the pressure was partly on me to set a good example for her. And later on, they realized how it was affecting me and did everything in their power to understand both of us and signed up to help our mental health in the right way.\n\nThey also went on to realize the mistakes they made and how much of my perfectionism comes from my dad and he is working on managing it together with me. \n\nCircumstances might have brought you to this state with your daughter, but by blaming her, when she is clearly seeking help, you are being delusional, cruel and it is no different from the abuse she already has been through. Get off that high horse and help her by getting her and YOURSELF therapy. Otherwise be prepared for her to go LC on your ass.", "YTA, you admit you weren\u2019t as hard on your younger daughter as you were with your elder daughter so you can\u2019t compare them. You abused her. She now has to struggle with the weight of that abuse. It will never be her fault that you abused her. It is not in her personality to be abused, it is in YOUR personality to be an abuser. Would your parents believe in PTSD? In postpartum depression and depression? Would they have called you a weak personality for succumbing to those things? Use your brain a bit here.", "Yta,  you are 100% an asshole.   You are what's wrong with people.   You are a prime example of Roe V. Wade shouldn't have been overturned in the U.S.A.", "YTA.  I think your whole family needs therapy. Your eldest daughter needs it to deal with the abuse you and your husband gave her. Your younger daughter may not be as vocal as your eldest was, but I can\u2019t imagine seeing this kind of behavior growing up that she didn\u2019t also suffer trauma. As for you and your husband, I think you guys need serious help. If you truly felt guilty, you wouldn\u2019t have said that to her. I see this as you trying to bargain your way out, to deflect responsibility to make yourself feel better. To let yourself feel like it isn\u2019t completely your fault when truly it is. Face the truth, and really from the bottom of your heart, apologize to your daughters for the past, and show them proof over time that you will change. If you don\u2019t try hard enough, you may not hear from them ever again when they\u2019ve truly had enough.", "YTA. There are never siblings who are raised exactly the same way.

You abused and mistreated your daughter and then had the nerve to say that it\u2019s her fault for not being strong enough to handle being abused? You should be ashamed of yourself.

My favorite part is where you admit your were harder on your oldest daughter and they say you treated your youngest the same way. \n\nYou were an abusive parent then and you're an abusive parent now.

Being unemployed, I had to beg my guidance counselor for leftover cafeteria food so my brother and I could eat. She\u2019s a single mom with a seven-day workweek. You think that gives her an excuse?\n\nWanting a better life for your children is no excuse for abusing them. When you withhold your love, your children will think they\u2019re not worthy of it, and they\u2019ll hate themselves.\n\nYou\u2019re despicable. I hope your children put you in a home and you die alone.", "If you wildly shoot a dozen arrows, some will miss the target and some will hit closer to the bullseye.

It\u2019s still 100% YOUR FAULT. \n\nI\u2019m truly sorry you were treated so horribly as a child. But you remember how it made you feel, and chose to make your kids suffer too. You CHOSE it. \n\nYTA, without even the slightest scrap of doubt.", "YTA - you yourself admitted that you were more strict with the older one (meaning you abused her more) yet you compare her to the younger one, saying that she turned out fine so it must be the older ones fault. Wow. I'm surprised she's still talking you.", "YTA", "I mean we could literally tell you that other ppl who fled their country lived normal lives and didn\u2019t treat their children like garbage. But no one does that bc they\u2019re caring enough to understand everyone has their own struggles.

YOU treated the eldest like crap so now she will have to deal with that for the rest of her life while she gets no comfort or any real apology bc you rather play the victim.", "YTA for the way you parented. But I also get that *most* parents are doing the best they can with the knowledge they have. You acknowledging you messed up is huge. So I give you some credit for that but have you apologized?

Some don\u2019t. Some have a lot. Some a little. BUT throwing that in her face also makes you an AH. If you want to help get therapy for all of you. What you did WAS traumatic for her. Period.

Try showing your daughters that you love them unconditionally, or you will lose at least one of them.", "You should be ashamed, both of having abused your daughters like that and for now blaming them for the results.

Not only are you TA, but you're lying as well.\n\nYou initially stated that your younger daughter was treated better, but then once your older daughter called you out on your terrible parenting, suddenly they were raised the same and she's a weak personality.\n\nYour daughter is going to go NC with you, and I hope she does it sooner rather than later because you've done nothing to help her.", "YTA. Your primary concern should be that your kids are happy. What is success to them, and fulfills them, may not be what you think is.

Which, honestly, is weird because you earlier made clear you know it wasn\u2019t right now.", "Wow. YTA. The blind spot of saying that your younger daughter was raised the same way, but doesn\u2019t have the same issues is astounding. First of all, your younger daughter may very well have those same issues but is afraid to share them with you because of how you treat your older daughter. Second of all, even if that isn\u2019t the case why are you blaming your daughter for how she turned out because of your bad parenting. It sounds like you want credit for taking accountability for your bad choices, but then you\u2019re trying to excuse and qualify it by saying that really it\u2019s her fault. Just from the little bit you shared, you treated her terribly. Her personality is what it is because of how she was raised. All you are doing is diminishing and devaluing your daughter struggles.  If you are truly sorry for how you treated her, then you will take true accountability for your actions without blaming your daughter, who was a child. All of this goes for her father too.  Just wow", "Yta. When you make excuses or don't own your own behavior, you are causing more damage still.

I cant even begin to explain how damaging that statement is. She needs to heal and instead of being validated, you went and called her weak.\n\nI feel for her. Her anger. Her sense of injustice. Her self loathing. Her heart break. Her sense of diminished self worth.\n\nOP, you need to take serious actionable steps to fix this. She needs to see actual effort and progress. Own your mistakes and show her how you are trying to be better. Dont say stuff like: \"oh, but i did my best\", \"your siblings turned out fine\", \"this is how it was done\".... none of that. None. \n\nShe wants to hear \"i am genuinely sorry. How can i help you?

There's a reason Chinese people my generation very commonly know at least 1 of our peers who have committed suicide.  I was very lucky that my father had a mentor who told him once that if he would be ashamed to tell people of his actions, then he should check himself.  My parents were strict, but they never did the counterproductive abuse BS.\n\nOn some level, it isn't about your children.  Abuse at that level is NEVER about wanting your child to thrive.  It's about you and YOUR ego.  I would do some deep, self introspection.  Then I would go apologize to your daughter and stop trying to excuse your actions.  \n\nAnd for the love of God just shut the fuck up about her sister or her other relatives.

Things were different 20 years ago. The science wasn't there. Mental health wasn't really talked about. We've learnt a lot since then. \n\nBut you need to acknowledge what you've done and take responsibility for it.

That's a big step and one many people don't take. That being said,  you're right - some of the things you put your daughter through were terrible and traumatic and it's a testament to how strong your daughter actually is that she made it this far despite some fairly shitty parenting. Sorry, but it's true. She didn't choose to be born - you chose to have her. You should've treated her better. I understand why it was hard and how you probably did the very best you could at the time, but it doesn't change the reality of her experience. You emotionally and psychologically abused her.

Your second daughter likely had more resources available to her and you were also more experienced as a parent.

She also prob looked at how you treated her older sister and decided to avoid that at all costs.  Your younger daughter had a sibling to help. Your older daughter had no one.

I am struggling and in therapy but my childhood and early adulthood have been a nighmare due to mental issues that I'm only now (25) starting to recover from that. I had to be hospitalized at some point because of the damage that I had some to myself because of the stress and the options were that I either get into a clinic to stay or return back home with my parents so that I could be under constant supervision. My parents and their way of raising us (plus the fact that my dad is one of the top scientists in his field to the point that we have to read some of his papers in uni) created that stress in me from when I was a little kid. They were way more lenient with my younger sister and by the time my younger brother was a teenager they were so visibly disappointed by us that they couldn't care less about what he did. I was always the quiet and \"good\" kid, they both were troublemakers and always picked fights with my parents that often turned physical. Yet they faced no consequences, no restrictions, nothing. I thought it was unfair, and the only time I tried to bring it up to my dad, very amicably and politely,  he instantly saw red and started yelling about how ungrateful I am and how I do not value everything he does for us as a parent.  \nThey were very surprised to receive a call from the hospital two years after I had left the house. \n\nI haven't visited home in two and a half years.

Your older daughter literally told you she's been struggling all her life for your approval which means she probably struggled with high anxiety all throughout her school years, which could most definitely affect her grades.

Don't lie and say there wasn't any difference in environment -- there is a four year age gap.

Since there was obviously no child before me, my parents had no prior experience parenting and there are things that they did with me that they (thankfully) did not replicate when raising my younger siblings. Also since I was the oldest, the majority of firsts happened with me, both positive and negative. With the negative ones that my siblings have also gone through, I've noticed that there is usually a different and oftentimes lesser reaction and punishment. It honestly weighs heavily upon me at times. This has also created a dissonance and disconnect with my siblings, as I have quite an age gap with them, so my relationship with my parents, especially my father, and how I view them is vastly different compared to them. I sympathize with your daughter because I too was raised with the demand for academic excellence and went through hell if my parents, particularly my father, was unhappy with my grades.

Obviously not every oldest child/child in general grows up traumatized and are fortunate to be raised by balanced and nurturing parents. \n\nYTA and how dare you blame your daughter for your failings as a parent when she's trying to share with you sincerely why she feels the way she does.
