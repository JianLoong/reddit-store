I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?", "created_utc": 1668043763, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr1nri/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_couldnt_have_known/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't get to claim that the disease, rather than the punch, was responsible for the severity of the injury and its consequences.\n\nThough this isn't a legal matter, a similar kind of thing is at play here.  It does not matter if she's just naturally more prone to depression or whatever.\n\nYou abused her.  Her supposed fragility is absolutely fucking irrelevant to your culpability here.  And if she *is* a little fragile, you were very likely a huge contributor to that, an exacerbating factor.

Why would you even bring that up? No matter what, you harmed her. Stop making excuses for that and trying to place the blame on your daughter. Victim blaming is horrible. \n\nAlso, are you serious for asking her why she's like this when she doesn't get the highest grade?

What do you think your daughter took from that?", "Don't blame her. Give her the gift of owning your mistakes, because this is NOT because of her personality. You ignored her for two weeks because of her grades (that is really cruel and neglectful). Tell her you will love her whether she is the best or not, and that her self worth is not based on that. Tell her you were in survival mode and didn't think you could survive without being the best, and you are ashamed of what you did and wish you could take it back, and hope she can forgive you. Don't put the blame on her personality, you made mistakes which led to her being this way (so what if her sister, a different person, responded a bit differently), and ask her to forgive you too. \n\nAnd this needs to stop:\n\n>so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees\n\nIs it NOT important in the present that she get a high degree for a good life, it's up to HER what will provide her happiness and a good life, so saying that in the present tense is what you have to work on now. Stop that part. Unless you are still pressuring her to be the best, or judging her if she isn't, or thinking her succeeding reflects on your or will benefit you... just stop that. High degrees does NOT equal high quality life, and while I think she needs therapy, I think hearing that from you will come as another slap, so just tell her you love her no matter what and are sorry you put so much pressure on her when you thought that was the only way to survive. Don't put pressure on her anymore, don't blame her, don't compare her to her sister or anyone, don't judge her or ask her why she's like that (she is 100% like that because the people who were supposed to love her IGNORED her for weeks not because she was bad, but because she wasn't perfect), and do NOT tell her what she needs to do anymore, or else in the present you would still be TA.

I had ptsd after fleeing my home country and looking back I might\u2019ve also have had postpartum depression after she was born.\n\nI admit I\u2019ve been very hard and strict with her, more than I did with her younger sister/my youngest daughter (24). I raised my daughter with outdated non-western principles, I see that now. But back then it seemed right because I was raised the same way.\n\nMy daughter has been struggling with depression and in my attempt to understand why we got into an argument. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it a few times but she never wanted to. Today she was upset about her grades. She\u2019s a masters student. She passed all her exams but she gets very upset and frustrated when she doesn\u2019t get the highest score. I was trying to calm her down and cheer her on. At one point asked her: why are you like this?\n\nShe got furious and told me that me and her dad were the reason why. That her whole life she had to earn our approval. She brought up the time where she scored \u201cmiddle education\u201d instead of \u201chigher education\u201d, (our country has a three school system depending on your degrees) Me and my husband were angry and disappointed, we did not talk to her for 2 weeks and she could noteat with us at the dinner table. She ate in the kitchen standing up or would put her plate in front of her door and knock. I\u2019m very embarrassed looking back at it and when she brought it up I got tears thinking that I did that to my child.\n\nI told her that looking back we see that negative reinforcement wasn\u2019t the right way. \u00a0I told her that we fled our home and started over elsewhere for her future so it was/is really important to us that she and her sister get high degrees, a good job and a good salary so they have a better life than we had. It was frustrating to us to see that she could do better than average or middle and we handled it wrongly.\n\nI then said: \u201cbut we could\u2019ve never known it would have such effects on your mental health when you got older, your sister was raised the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure so you it\u2019s also a little bit -you as a person-\u201c.\n\nThe conversation then escalated. She asked me where I got the nerve to blame her personality while her whole life we made her feel like she had to earn our love and approval. She said this affected her life in every aspect and it\u2019s why she\u2019s has a depression. She called me an asshole and said that I was basically saying she has a weak personality.\n\nI know we made horrible mistakes and I\u2019m ashamed of some of the things I\u2019ve done. But I feel that it\u2019s true. Her sister was pushed the same way and isn\u2019t so insecure to the point it effects her mental health. She isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nMy husband said there was no reason to bring that up. I believe it\u2019s not completely our parenting style that caused her depression.\n\nAITA for saying that to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re gonna sleep real good tonight after reading all these comments and (hopefully but this is probably wishful thinking) starting to come to terms with how awful of a parent you\u2019ve been and are continuing to be, I bet\u2026oh, and YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAs a woman with depression who was raised similarly to your daughter, it is really hard for me to come to grips with your justification.\n\nHere's another POV; I am the oldest and much like your younger daughter, I came out \"okay\" while my brother was the one who acted out.  It still didn't stop the trauma.  It didn't change the past; I wasn't okay because of my childhood.  I was okay in *SPITE* of my childhood.  \n\nThe whole earning approval and love?  Oh I felt that.  I LIVED that.\n\nSo make no mistake; your younger daughter might be coping a little more resiliently that your eldest, but she is suffering all the same and because of your and your husbands treatment.   They react differently but they are suffering from trauma.\n\nI should've stood by my brother when he pointed out to my parents how much pain they had put us through.  I wish that I didn't bottle it all inside until eventually the dam broke.  I'm not gonna say that childhood trauma definitely caused your daughter's depression but it sounds like you are trying to minimize her response to your actions because of her younger sister reacting differently and that is not fair to either of them.", "One mom to another, YTA for so many reasons.  You mentally and emotionally abused your daughter,  who she is now is who you shaped her to be.  Yes some people can take more abuse than others but that in no way makes any of her problems her fault. I was a horrible mother to my middle child and they are now very mentally scarred because of it. I did the same thing you are doing,  deflecting blame back onto them rather than accepting that I was 100% at fault.  One year ago I stood in a hospital and watched doctors fight to save my child. I got a second chance I didn't deserve to be a better mom. I have managed to repair a lot of our relationship and we are now very close. I didn't deserve it but my child has forgiven me. DO BETTER! Say your sorry and mean it! Stop blaming her for your mistakes.", "YTA. You literally contradicted yourself. You said you weren\u2019t as tough on your younger daughter then go on to say you pushed your younger daughter the same way. \n\nAnd sorry, but this is all on you either way. Wtf kind of parent doesn\u2019t speak to a child for two weeks and make them eat alone stood in a kitchen? That\u2019s abuse. The nerve of putting any blame on your daughter is insane. You fucked up and she\u2019s paying the consequences for it.", "OMG. So so so YTA. And here is why.\nI am like your daughter, the elder one. And I have a younger sister. Our parents were not abusive in any way, but the pressure for being amazing, not just good was always there. It started out as just us being better than our classmates at everything we did, and it ended at toxic perfectionism, anxiety and depression, probably more for me, just a little less for my sister.\n\nThe reason why my younger sister did relatively better with handling her mental health is that the pressure was partly on me to set a good example for her. And later on, they realized how it was affecting me and did everything in their power to understand both of us and signed up to help our mental health in the right way.\n\nThey also went on to realize the mistakes they made and how much of my perfectionism comes from my dad and he is working on managing it together with me. \n\nCircumstances might have brought you to this state with your daughter, but by blaming her, when she is clearly seeking help, you are being delusional, cruel and it is no different from the abuse she already has been through. Get off that high horse and help her by getting her and YOURSELF therapy. Otherwise be prepared for her to go LC on your ass.", "YTA, you admit you weren\u2019t as hard on your younger daughter as you were with your elder daughter so you can\u2019t compare them. You abused her. She now has to struggle with the weight of that abuse. It will never be her fault that you abused her. It is not in her personality to be abused, it is in YOUR personality to be an abuser. Would your parents believe in PTSD? In postpartum depression and depression? Would they have called you a weak personality for succumbing to those things? Use your brain a bit here.", "Yta,  you are 100% an asshole.   You are what's wrong with people.   You are a prime example of Roe V. Wade shouldn't have been overturned in the U.S.A.", "YTA.  I think your whole family needs therapy. Your eldest daughter needs it to deal with the abuse you and your husband gave her. Your younger daughter may not be as vocal as your eldest was, but I can\u2019t imagine seeing this kind of behavior growing up that she didn\u2019t also suffer trauma. As for you and your husband, I think you guys need serious help. If you truly felt guilty, you wouldn\u2019t have said that to her. I see this as you trying to bargain your way out, to deflect responsibility to make yourself feel better. To let yourself feel like it isn\u2019t completely your fault when truly it is. Face the truth, and really from the bottom of your heart, apologize to your daughters for the past, and show them proof over time that you will change.

You think that gives her an excuse?\n\nWanting a better life for your children is no excuse for abusing them.

The blind spot of saying that your younger daughter was raised the same way, but doesn\u2019t have the same issues is astounding. First of all, your younger daughter may very well have those same issues but is afraid to share them with you because of how you treat your older daughter. Second of all, even if that isn\u2019t the case why are you blaming your daughter for how she turned out because of your bad parenting. It sounds like you want credit for taking accountability for your bad choices, but then you\u2019re trying to excuse and qualify it by saying that really it\u2019s her fault. Just from the little bit you shared, you treated her terribly. Her personality is what it is because of how she was raised. All you are doing is diminishing and devaluing your daughter struggles.

And that this is not daughter's fault. OP though isn't less of an asshole because younger sis was affected less. YTA.", "Yeah, there is a total lack of accountability and insight here. OP listen to everyone here and do better.", "THIS is an excellent point. OP says she knows she was wrong and accepts blame, but the rest of her post is her justifying, being defensive, and blaming daughter's personality. SMH.  YTA", "I came here to say exactly this. OP did not turn out fine, evidenced by placing the blame on her daughter.", "? Nta?", "Exactly what I came here to say. My mom was incredibly tough on me and had very high expectations. Did it affect my mental health? Yeah. But I\u2019m an adult with my own kids now and I realize that my mom was just trying her best to make sure I turned out better than her. She didn\u2019t damage me on purpose and I\u2019m grown enough to come to terms with that. OP shouldn\u2019t have compared her daughters or suggested the depression was her daughter\u2019s fault. But OPs daughter also won\u2019t improve her mental health by blaming everything on her.", "Oh my gosh thank you for pointing that out!! That was bugging me!!", "This is a woman BTW", "Exactly! Like where is the accountability? acceptance? remorse? She says she understands but next is like it your fault you\u2019re that way? MAJOR YTA. I hope the daughter is in therapy.", "She also starts out by saying she was stricter on the older daughter than the younger - which was probably plenty bad enough", "Fixed typo", "Oops", "Very true! I forgot that part!"]}
