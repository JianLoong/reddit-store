So for your fianc\u00e9 to now say \"I should\u2019ve asked him again privately if it was so important to me to know what was said and that I should\u2019ve trusted him not to let anybody say something bad about me\" is just bullshit. Obviously his family was talking shit because it was so rude that (i) your fianc\u00e9's dad refused to translate, and (ii) your fianc\u00e9's dad yelled at his son and nephew.\n\nSecond, it's just rude for your fianc\u00e9's friends to switch to Italian so they could talk about you. \n\nYou should think long and hard about whether you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who would treat you so disrespectfully.", "NTA - except you did trust him to tell you and he didn\u2019t. If he can\u2019t repeat what was said then he knew it was out of pocket and didn\u2019t bet on his own dad to hold him to a standard he should hold himself. Fuck around and find out, served with a side of fatherly wisdom. Now you just gotta learn Italian so the next time it happens you can talk shit back and watch their faces sink. Your fianc\u00e9 owes you an apology as loud as their disrespect.", "He pretty sure showed that he can't be trusted to have your back. His dad wouldn't have told him off and kept a secret about what has been said if that was the case... And to be honest I find it rather disrespectful that they excluded you like this. My Sil is from China and every time she was in the room I would switch to a language that she can understand clearly just to make her feel included. Only if I have a hard time saying something in English I would switch for a short time. And he should have recognized that you were more than uncomfortable with that. He seemed fine to ignore that, too. \nNTA at all.", "NTA. Your fiance said nasty things about you with his friends. They did this in front of you because they have no respect for you.

I know this sub loves the word gaslighting but it smells like some old fashioned street lamps up in this story.

You don't owe him any protections on poor and rude behavior.\n\nAnd obviously you can't trust him to stop any bad said about you in real time.
