I was overwhelmed with what happened after so I couldn't reply to a lot of people. \n\nAnd not to the update, long story short my sister didn't break the switch, it was her \"friend\" who threw it and made my sister say it was her. A few days after it happened, my sister came to my room and said that her \"friend\" bullies her at school, made her invite to our house and play on the switch. My sister is very shy and impressionable, and that girl used and manipulated her. Obviously I don't have any proof but it does make sense, my sister is usually very careful with the things she borrows from me, and she did get bullied last year by other girls.\n\nI won't get into much details any further but we did contact her parents and got and apology, they refused to pay though. My sister got switched to home schooling for now and doing really well", "created_utc": 1675575119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u491u/update_aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_cover_half/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Your poor sister. I'm glad she told the truth. I'm sorry about your Switch. You sound like a really great sibling.", "I\u2019m glad your sister is away from her bully. I hope you got a new Switch, OP!", "Your sister will probably be better off now she is being home schooled. Until she is ready to go back to the more social setting of school. Poor thing.\nI\u2019m also sorry to hear about your switch. You sound like my brothers who take VERY good care of their game consoles! I wish your parents would have helped you out somehow though. They should have been watching the kids :/", "Your parents suck, sorry.", "Her parents need to pay for your switch. I hope your parents aren\u2019t that daft for this scenario now. I\u2019m pretty sure you can press charges for destruction of property", "I'm glad the whole incident at least ended in something positive for your sister since she's now away from that bully. However your parents still should pay for the nintendo because the girls were under their supervision and I found it incredibly neglecting that they were not even supervising the conversation between them. They didn't noticed your sister's tension? Nervousness around that girl? Your parents should be more aware, your sister's bully was literally under their roof and they didn't noticed? Idk sounds pretty mean to me.", "You're 19, you can file to take them to small claims court for the money for a new switch. No lawyer needed, you're 19 so you have nothing but time, and it may make them just pay up the money instead of having to go to court. People hear court and get nervous.", "I feel for your sister. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you guys press charges over the switch? \n\nMight be worth it"]}
