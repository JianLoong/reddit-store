I was overwhelmed with what happened after so I couldn't reply to a lot of people. \n\nAnd not to the update, long story short my sister didn't break the switch, it was her \"friend\" who threw it and made my sister say it was her. A few days after it happened, my sister came to my room and said that her \"friend\" bullies her at school, made her invite to our house and play on the switch. My sister is very shy and impressionable, and that girl used and manipulated her. Obviously I don't have any proof but it does make sense, my sister is usually very careful with the things she borrows from me, and she did get bullied last year by other girls.\n\nI won't get into much details any further but we did contact her parents and got and apology, they refused to pay though. My sister got switched to home schooling for now and doing really well", "created_utc": 1675575119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u491u/update_aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_cover_half/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Your poor sister. I'm glad she told the truth. I'm sorry about your Switch. You sound like a really great sibling.", "I\u2019m glad your sister is away from her bully. I hope you got a new Switch, OP!", "Your sister will probably be better off now she is being home schooled. Until she is ready to go back to the more social setting of school. Poor thing.\nI\u2019m also sorry to hear about your switch. You sound like my brothers who take VERY good care of their game consoles! I wish your parents would have helped you out somehow though. They should have been watching the kids :/"]}
