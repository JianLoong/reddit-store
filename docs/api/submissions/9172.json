I was overwhelmed with what happened after so I couldn't reply to a lot of people. \n\nAnd not to the update, long story short my sister didn't break the switch, it was her \"friend\" who threw it and made my sister say it was her. A few days after it happened, my sister came to my room and said that her \"friend\" bullies her at school, made her invite to our house and play on the switch. My sister is very shy and impressionable, and that girl used and manipulated her. Obviously I don't have any proof but it does make sense, my sister is usually very careful with the things she borrows from me, and she did get bullied last year by other girls.\n\nI won't get into much details any further but we did contact her parents and got and apology, they refused to pay though. My sister got switched to home schooling for now and doing really well", "created_utc": 1675575119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u491u/update_aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_cover_half/", "score": 857, "replies": ["Your poor sister. I'm glad she told the truth. I'm sorry about your Switch. You sound like a really great sibling.", "I\u2019m glad your sister is away from her bully. I hope you got a new Switch, OP!", "Your sister will probably be better off now she is being home schooled. Until she is ready to go back to the more social setting of school. Poor thing.\nI\u2019m also sorry to hear about your switch. You sound like my brothers who take VERY good care of their game consoles! I wish your parents would have helped you out somehow though. They should have been watching the kids :/", "Your parents suck, sorry.", "Her parents need to pay for your switch. I hope your parents aren\u2019t that daft for this scenario now. I\u2019m pretty sure you can press charges for destruction of property", "I'm glad the whole incident at least ended in something positive for your sister since she's now away from that bully. However your parents still should pay for the nintendo because the girls were under their supervision and I found it incredibly neglecting that they were not even supervising the conversation between them. They didn't noticed your sister's tension? Nervousness around that girl? Your parents should be more aware, your sister's bully was literally under their roof and they didn't noticed? Idk sounds pretty mean to me.", "You're 19, you can file to take them to small claims court for the money for a new switch. No lawyer needed, you're 19 so you have nothing but time, and it may make them just pay up the money instead of having to go to court. People hear court and get nervous.", "I feel for your sister. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you guys press charges over the switch? \n\nMight be worth it", "Assuming that you are in the U.S., you may want to consider small claims court. I suggest that you download a copy of a summons and complaint form for your local small claims court, insert the details, sign it, and attach it to a letter stating that if the parents do not reimburse you for the Switch, you will file the attached complaint.  Then be sure to send it via certified mail, return receipt requested or by a courier service like Federal Express. The courier service would be better because it will show that delivery was made while someone can refuse to sign the certified mail card.", "Damn. Now I *wish* your sis had just been careless. You sound like a good sibling, and I wish both of you lots of luck from now on", "Sue the parents in a small claims court, its easy and do it yourself. If they apologised they admitted it happened.", "Contact the girl's parents and tell them if they do not pay for the switch, you will file a police report for the destruction of property and send them to their house. Let them know that is all you need to get the ball rolling for small claims court and you will be asking for legal expenses as well. If they don't pay, follow through.", "How do those cost? Dinosaur here", "If you know the \"friend\" did it would your home insurance cover it? Otherwise I agree with the suggestion of small claims court.", "This right here", "I'm guessing you meant to put \"how much do they cost\"? If so they cost $300-$350 depending on which version you get.", "The other parents should be paying for a whole new one. Can you sue them for it?", "Take those fuckers to couuuuuuurt.\n\n\nSmall claims court will likely rule in your favor.", "Wow if I was your mother I would sue the parents", "You could take the parents to small claims for the entire cost. No lawyer is needed just a filing fee. The daughter coerced her way into your house to damage property. Maybe after receiving papers her parents might change their decision about paying.", "They really do :/", "Agreed. Plus, sometimes the threat of going to a small claims court is enough to get people to pay", "Thanks", "Small Claims Court might be an option for you... especially if you can get an email or text of them admitting or agreeing to some sort of responsibility but refusing to pay.", "You can sue the person or their parents and small claims court potentially. Or you can contact the police because them destroy your property is illegal and a police officer Contacting them might scare them enough just to pay for what they broke instead of having to go through small claims court", "Have a look online at small claims court. Take a look at how the process works and the cost. It is really simple here in the UK and I have done it twice. The first time they chose to settle up before it was seen by the judge. Sometimes just receiving the paperwork is enough to get them to cough up.", "I'm guessing you meant to put \"how much do they cost\"?", "Don't do this. Just file the paperwork. \n\n\"Do *X* or else I'll do *Y*\" is the formula for blackmail. Threatening a lawsuit can be construed as blackmail and it's safer to avoid that risk entirely. They can always settle out of court after receiving the summons if they don't want to go to court over it."]}
