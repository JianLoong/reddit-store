I was overwhelmed with what happened after so I couldn't reply to a lot of people. \n\nAnd not to the update, long story short my sister didn't break the switch, it was her \"friend\" who threw it and made my sister say it was her. A few days after it happened, my sister came to my room and said that her \"friend\" bullies her at school, made her invite to our house and play on the switch. My sister is very shy and impressionable, and that girl used and manipulated her. Obviously I don't have any proof but it does make sense, my sister is usually very careful with the things she borrows from me, and she did get bullied last year by other girls.\n\nI won't get into much details any further but we did contact her parents and got and apology, they refused to pay though. My sister got switched to home schooling for now and doing really well", "created_utc": 1675575119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u491u/update_aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_cover_half/", "score": 1193, "replies": ["Your poor sister. I'm glad she told the truth. I'm sorry about your Switch. You sound like a really great sibling.", "I\u2019m glad your sister is away from her bully. I hope you got a new Switch, OP!", "Your sister will probably be better off now she is being home schooled. Until she is ready to go back to the more social setting of school. Poor thing.\nI\u2019m also sorry to hear about your switch. You sound like my brothers who take VERY good care of their game consoles! I wish your parents would have helped you out somehow though. They should have been watching the kids :/", "Your parents suck, sorry.", "Her parents need to pay for your switch. I hope your parents aren\u2019t that daft for this scenario now. I\u2019m pretty sure you can press charges for destruction of property", "I'm glad the whole incident at least ended in something positive for your sister since she's now away from that bully. However your parents still should pay for the nintendo because the girls were under their supervision and I found it incredibly neglecting that they were not even supervising the conversation between them. They didn't noticed your sister's tension? Nervousness around that girl? Your parents should be more aware, your sister's bully was literally under their roof and they didn't noticed? Idk sounds pretty mean to me.", "You're 19, you can file to take them to small claims court for the money for a new switch. No lawyer needed, you're 19 so you have nothing but time, and it may make them just pay up the money instead of having to go to court. People hear court and get nervous.", "I feel for your sister. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you guys press charges over the switch? \n\nMight be worth it", "Assuming that you are in the U.S., you may want to consider small claims court. I suggest that you download a copy of a summons and complaint form for your local small claims court, insert the details, sign it, and attach it to a letter stating that if the parents do not reimburse you for the Switch, you will file the attached complaint.  Then be sure to send it via certified mail, return receipt requested or by a courier service like Federal Express. The courier service would be better because it will show that delivery was made while someone can refuse to sign the certified mail card.", "Damn. Now I *wish* your sis had just been careless. You sound like a good sibling, and I wish both of you lots of luck from now on", "Sue the parents in a small claims court, its easy and do it yourself. If they apologised they admitted it happened.", "Contact the girl's parents and tell them if they do not pay for the switch, you will file a police report for the destruction of property and send them to their house. Let them know that is all you need to get the ball rolling for small claims court and you will be asking for legal expenses as well. If they don't pay, follow through.", "How do those cost? Dinosaur here", "If you know the \"friend\" did it would your home insurance cover it? Otherwise I agree with the suggestion of small claims court.", "This right here", "I'm guessing you meant to put \"how much do they cost\"? If so they cost $300-$350 depending on which version you get.", "The other parents should be paying for a whole new one. Can you sue them for it?", "Take those fuckers to couuuuuuurt.\n\n\nSmall claims court will likely rule in your favor.", "Wow if I was your mother I would sue the parents", "You could take the parents to small claims for the entire cost. No lawyer is needed just a filing fee. The daughter coerced her way into your house to damage property. Maybe after receiving papers her parents might change their decision about paying.", "They really do :/", "Agreed. Plus, sometimes the threat of going to a small claims court is enough to get people to pay", "Thanks", "Small Claims Court might be an option for you... especially if you can get an email or text of them admitting or agreeing to some sort of responsibility but refusing to pay.", "You can sue the person or their parents and small claims court potentially. Or you can contact the police because them destroy your property is illegal and a police officer Contacting them might scare them enough just to pay for what they broke instead of having to go through small claims court", "Have a look online at small claims court. Take a look at how the process works and the cost. It is really simple here in the UK and I have done it twice. The first time they chose to settle up before it was seen by the judge. Sometimes just receiving the paperwork is enough to get them to cough up.", "I'm guessing you meant to put \"how much do they cost\"?", "Don't do this. Just file the paperwork. \n\n\"Do *X* or else I'll do *Y*\" is the formula for blackmail. Threatening a lawsuit can be construed as blackmail and it's safer to avoid that risk entirely. They can always settle out of court after receiving the summons if they don't want to go to court over it.", "If you know where the bully lives, get a carton of eggs and launch an artillery strike to their house.\n\nHide your face if you do!", "I agree with the people who suggests small claims court. You can ask them for a portion of replacement costs, and let them know that if you are forced to file with small claims court it will be for replacement value and court costs. Remind them that their daughter is a bully and should be held accountable for her actions or it will escalate. They can reduce what they spend on her birthdays and Christmas, giving her a coupon for the portion of the switch that was payed for instead. It\u2019ll make her think before breaking someone else\u2019s possessions. (Going to court is better than going full on petty and smashing the cellphone to teach her a lesson. Sorry, but that crossed my mind.)", "If you want to push the matter, you could always take the bully\u2019s parents to small claims court to get them to pay.", "Umm. somehow I doubt that your sister was telling the truth about that. Someone purposefully asked do you have a switch and somehow forced her into leading that person to her house? kinda skeptical. NTA tho", "[removed]", "mall Claims Court might be an option for you.", "This, OP! Small claims court is a good idea, provided your sister agrees (in principle) to testify. If you're in a city with a university that has a law school, you could check if they have a \"legal clinic\" - it should be on the website - where students can practice being lawyers with small-time clients. \n\nWe took our landlord to small claims court that way, with a student from our local law school; we ended up taking it all the way to a hearing and won three months' worth of free rent! It was a pretty cool experience, cost us nothing, and inspired both my husband and me to go to law school ourselves. (I paid it forward and did the clinic program in third year.)", "Please file charges against them to get them to pay!", "This is my favorite typo.", "I find it hard to imagine it's blackmail to give someone an opportunity to rectify the damages before pursuing legal action/warning of legal action.", "It can be done if the letter is phrased as being an offer to settle the matter, and failure to do so will result in OP pursuing any and all legal remedies, including and not limited to filing suit in small claims court, with a sample of the complaint attached.", "I hear a lawwwsuit! SUE THEM :)", "It can happen, it's not a definitive, always happens, type of thing, but if the demand letter isn't phrased correctly and you're dealing with shitty people it definitely can. Especially if you don't have any proof that they should be responsible for the damages you're asking for in the first place.\n\nUnless OP has a lawyer to write up a demand letter to ensure she isn't opening herself up to risk, it's safer for her to just file the suit.", "That is true.", "Tell the \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d parents.", "Typo or bot? It's a common enough phrase, but [someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u491u/update_aita_for_asking_my_parents_to_cover_half/j7bxnm4/) did already comment that (though with the \"s\"), complete with the Unusual Capitalization.
