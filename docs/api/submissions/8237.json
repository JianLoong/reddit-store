My mom didn't do that growing up and I was forced to eat foods that made me ill. I won't go out of my way to make meals that someone will not touch due to not liking it. It's really not that hard to do this in my house because generally speaking my kids and husband are not picky at all and don't have any safe foods or anything.

But like I said, it's rare to run in to an issue because they aren't picky most of the time.\n\nI on the other hand don't like a handful of foods and I will not touch them. Like spaghetti is a huge one for me. I hate spaghetti, beef stew, pot roast of any kind, mashed potatoes (whipped are okay sometimes), meat loaf, Salisbury steak, brussel sprouts, califlower, etc etc. I can safely say that most of which I hate isn't even a taste issue. It's that I've eaten these foods so many times because either everyone in my house (husband especially) wants them 24/7 OR someone from my childhood growing up did. I just can't stand any of those foods anymore and will not eat it. I usually cook for my family and will make myself something small on the side of I make any of these meals. My husband knows what I like and don't like.\n\nWhenever he cooks though he always makes something I absolutely will not eat. Like potatoes (he literally wants potatoes with every meal, to a point where my kids are starting to hate them) and meat loaf. Or spaghetti. Those are his two go to meals whenever he cooks and I won't eat it. Never have. He cooked yesterday while I was sick and made spaghetti and when I woke up he told me I needed to eat something. So I went out and grabbed something else (cheese and pepperoni) and he got pissed that I didn't want to eat dinner. He said he hates cooking because I never eat it. I told him if it bothered him than maybe he should stop cooking meals he knows I won't touch. He said I make it so he doesn't want to cook at all. AITA?\n\nETA: most of the foods I listed either make me vomit or go right through me. We have been together since I was 15 so he knows this. He is also a chef day to day but whenever he cooks at home he sticks to meatloaf and potatoes or spaghetti. He never makes anything else, with the exception of beef stew maybe once a year.\n\nETA: I don't expect him to cook separately for me when he does cook. I have no problem cooking for myself. The issue is that he gets pissed when I won't eat the food he makes and I always make myself something different.

I would say, knowing that you're actually really difficult to include in a family meal, the onus should be on you to make sure you have something you've prepared for yourself ready for when you can't take part; and I think you need to let the person cooking know beforehand that you won't be having the food so they don't over prepare.\n\nYou said yourself you often make yourself a separate meal anyway, and I think it's a bit much to expect other people to do that for you as an adult, especially after a long day at work, cooking individual meals for people!

Do you have a lot of cook books with food you actually enjoy that he could use to get ideas from?", "NTA. Your husband knows that these specific foods make you sick and he keeps doing this. He sounds controlling. Is he like this in other aspects of your life together? Because this isn't normal behavior when you love someone. The fact that he's now doing this to your kids has me concerned. He's setting the kids up to have more issues with food down the line. I'd seriously go to therapy alone and maybe couple's counseling if he isn't a narcissistic person.

Of all the possible meals in this world to cook, why would he only cook meals that are comprised of things you don\u2019t like? As many other commenters have pointed out, it\u2019s probably his passive aggressive way of letting you know that he resents cooking. \n\nHonestly I think you should just keep doing what you\u2019re doing.

My partner prefers to burn eggs when making breakfast so I sometimes decline their offer of what is a dish I normally love. To only cook things you hate/cannot eat and then get mad when you cook/get something else for yourself is not appropriate.  He can either make something you also can eat (along with the rest of the family) OR he stop being upset you choose to eat something that won't make you sick. It's not a reflection of his skills/cooking, it's your relationship with those particular foods that just won't change. It's not a hard life to not eat spaghetti or meatloaf.

To be clear, I'm not armchair diagnosing you. But there are millions of people who have minor issues like this that don't rise to the level of needing medication or major medical intervention, but for whom clear dietary boundaries can be life-changing. Without getting into it ad nauseum (no pun intended), I suffered for decades (literally from toddlerhood) because my mum thought I just had a \"tricky stomach\" and was a \"picky eater\" until a doctor said \"IBS\" . . . and when I figured out what made me feel worse and better I went from NEVER having had a normal bowel movement in my life to feeling significantly healthier, despite other MAJOR ILLNESSES, just by eating a very slightly changed diet.

Side dishes like rice, farro (OMG I love farro, it's such a great neutral base for a side dish but also a complex carb that's so healthy), sweet potatoes (great fibre), easy roast veg (almost any root veg at high temp for 20 minutes in the oven); a couple of your own favourite simple dinners. Stick it on the fridge or somewhere else that he can see it easily, so he has no excuse to ignore it, or make it into a little notebook of \"Dad's Dinners\". In other words, spoonfeed him alternatives. It's gross and you shouldn't have to, but it takes away his excuse to default to things you can't eat if he has other easy things right in front of him.\n\n2) Continue to cook for yourself, and when he complains or suggests that it's insulting, just point blank ask him if he would rather you make yourself (or allow him to make you) ill? Period. You are not being difficult, you are trying to avoid actual physical pain and illness. If he will not participate in that, then he is leaving you no choice.

None of this should be happening at all, and I'm really, genuinely sorry that he isn't holding up his end in the kitchen.", "NTA", "How about the next few times he fixes something that makes you ill.

Once a month, family sit down and you make a meal plan for the next month. Everyone sticks to the meal plan. ***The meal plan has to include two meals.*** One meal for those with dietary restrictions (like yourself) and one for those without. Everyone is allowed a *one* one-day meal veto where they can say \"let's not have X meal on Y day\", and everyone has to have at least one meal they like or want to try on the meal plan. That way everyone has something they can eat and no one can complain because everything is planned. \n2. Go to the doctor about your dietary issues and explain it this way. \"Due to the nature of my symptoms, I am worried about the affects it will have on the health of myself and my unborn child. These issues are becoming debilitating to my daily life and are causing issues between myself and those important to my life. I need a definitive answer as to what is causing my symptoms so that I can receive adequate care. Please run some tests to ensure I do not have any underlying conditions.\" and if they continue to say no, respond with \"very well. Will you please mark it in my chart that you have denied my request and your reason why.\" and once they do, find a different doctor. (I had to do this a lot to get diagnosed with Endometriosis/adenomyosis. It sucked but it finally got me the care/treatment I needed). \n3. Counseling. You and your husband need to start couples counseling. There is an underlying issue here on his end that he's clearly not communicating, and is just expecting you to just bend over backwards to accommodate him. He needs to be open about whatever the issue is and not put you in a position where your health can be affected. And he needs to give you a proper apology for constantly putting your health at risk and adding stress on you during your pregnancy. If he refuses, and/or continues this behavior, take whatever steps you need to in order to keep yourself and your baby safe and healthy. \n\nI wish you luck OP and hope things get better soon.", "NTA, your husband is doing this on purpose.", "NTA.

Doesn't matter that her refusal is for valid reasons. She should eat his food, because he's Chef.
