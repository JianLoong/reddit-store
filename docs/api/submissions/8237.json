It's really not that hard to do this in my house because generally speaking my kids and husband are not picky at all and don't have any safe foods or anything.

Like spaghetti is a huge one for me. I hate spaghetti, beef stew, pot roast of any kind, mashed potatoes (whipped are okay sometimes), meat loaf, Salisbury steak, brussel sprouts, califlower, etc etc. I can safely say that most of which I hate isn't even a taste issue. It's that I've eaten these foods so many times because either everyone in my house (husband especially) wants them 24/7 OR someone from my childhood growing up did.

Those are his two go to meals whenever he cooks and I won't eat it. Never have. He cooked yesterday while I was sick and made spaghetti and when I woke up he told me I needed to eat something. So I went out and grabbed something else (cheese and pepperoni) and he got pissed that I didn't want to eat dinner. He said he hates cooking because I never eat it. I told him if it bothered him than maybe he should stop cooking meals he knows I won't touch. He said I make it so he doesn't want to cook at all.

He is also a chef day to day but whenever he cooks at home he sticks to meatloaf and potatoes or spaghetti. He never makes anything else, with the exception of beef stew maybe once a year.\n\nETA: I don't expect him to cook separately for me when he does cook. I have no problem cooking for myself. The issue is that he gets pissed when I won't eat the food he makes and I always make myself something different.

If she had a related medical condition it would have been mentioned. She even says she ate loads of it as a kid so she's likely being melodramatic because she doesn't like it. Sure she doesn't have to eat anything that she doesn't want to but after reading her post, she comes across as pretty immature.", "She said she has a small list of things she *won\u2019t* eat, not a small list of things she *will* eat. It does not sound like ARFID (I have ARFID).", "So you have been assessed for ARFID?", "You don't even need a valid reason to not like food.  It's like you don't need a valid reason to not find a person attractive, or like a TV show.  As long as you try to eat a balanced diet, it's fine to just say no to stuff you don't want in your life!", "First thing I thought, too.  ARFID is a real butt sometimes.", "It's also super common to have gall bladder attacks in early pregnancy. The crappy part is, there's little they can do until you're not pregnant.", "Sorry only read original post not updates OP made in the comments or the eta she added later", "I have asked him to make something I was craving before but he will never make it. So I will be like \"hey we should have *x* tonight\" and he will immediately be like \"hmm, I'm kind of craving *y*\" and then he will just make whatever he wants. Which, as I said, is usually spaghetti or meatloaf. I have had conversations with him about it but it just seems to fall on deaf ears. When I remind him of what I won't eat or can't eat, it's immediately a \"I just don't understand\" comment on his end and that's the end of the conversation basically, or he will become irritated because those are his favorite foods.", "She hasn\u2019t been diagnosed bc they\u2019ve refused to test her. OP is in a very difficult position. \n\nShe went to a nutritionist not an MD which makes sense but that\u2019s not the person to ask if it\u2019s a medical issue. And it doesn\u2019t sound like they told her that which was negligent on their part.\n\nIdk where she is or what her medical care covers but further testing is warranted before anyone decides it\u2019s in her head.", "My point is that it\u2019s frustrating to deal with. You\u2019re only further proving that by saying he gets mad when you don\u2019t eat them. I understand being hurt by this but it sounds like a lot of resentment about this issue is building up so maybe y\u2019all need to talk about it, maybe you even need to go so far as counseling about it, but there are two sides to this.", "That comment was not meant for you. I posted it to the wrong comment. I apologize.", "OP replied several times that she indeed have a prepared meal plan/meal calendar but husbands keep ignoring it", "What do you think the meal calendar is? It's a weekly meal plan and I just said to you that he doesn't follow it.", "If there's a possibility you could just cook for you and the kids and leave him be until he listens", "A lot of people get physically ill from spaghetti, as a lot of peoples systems don't work well with starchy foods. You have the typical \"well since it doesn't happen to me it doesn't happen to anyone\" attitude.", "So, you would eat dog food if your partner took the time to put it on a plate for you? Who the fuck goes around eating shit they don't like?", "I vomit most times I eat things heavy in tomatoes. I\u2019ve checked repeatedly, no allergy or any issue as far as me and doctors can tell. I just hate them that much. It gets rid of spaghetti, lasagna, most pizza, etc. for me. And it sucks but I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t handle it. I once at work had a burrito that accidentally didn\u2019t remove the Pico de Gallo and not only could I not handle more than two bites due to the taste, I very shortly after threw up and had to be sent home.\n\nI similarly can\u2019t do anything with seafood except for some reason miso soup and again, no allergy. I don\u2019t have an explanation for mine outside of absolute revolt, at least OPs seems related to some issues in their childhood.", "I agree, so go get those tests. Find an MD and the correct treatment. By not getting them \u2026 they are allowing the problem to continue.", "Never heard it from anyone else either. I think you're just childish really. Grow up and communicate with your husband instead of reddit if it's that big a deal.", "Do have you been to a doctor to get that checked out? That's a long and various list to get physically sick from...\n\nEither you have some serious digestive problem or it's psycho-somatic. Whatever it is you should really get that checked out.\n\nIf you have an actual physical reason why it makes you sick your husband is definetly TA for continueing to cook those things.\nIf not I would get tired of it as well if you refuse to get it checked or do anything about it if possible.", "What a moronic comparison. Also I clearly said she doesn't have to eat things she doesn't like. Try reading.", "Do potatoes or eggplant bother you also? Some people can't eat nightshades.", "I can\u2019t agree they\u2019re TA tho for simply not wanting to eat things that make them vomit. Maybe NAH but forcing herself to eat things that make her sick isn\u2019t the answer either.", "That's pretty much what husband is doing. Meatloaf and potatoes are what dogs get from canned food. OP also never said she wasn't ill after her parents forced her to eat those foods. Call bullshit all you want. Husband needs to grow up.", "Potatoes sit really heavy in my stomach, even if it's just a spoonful. Almost immediately makes me sick. But I can eat like.. french fries or tater tots. I've never actually tried eggplant. My husband hates it and I've never cooked it or even know how so I just never buy it.", "I never suggested she do that.", "Yeah it's not though is it. OP needs to grow up. Look at her other comments, she sounds like an entitled child saying she shouldn't have to do anything about it but her husband should. He's cooking for his kids, if she can't handle it then she should make her own and stop complaining. Enabling her whiney childish behaviour is not the way forward. She clearly has a lot of growing up to do if she needs to run to reddit with this minor issue rather than, you know, actually talking to her husband about it.", "The question is is she TA for refusing to eat what she\u2019s offered. \n\nSo \u2026 no, she\u2019s not. \n\nWould she ideally have access to the care she needs? \n\nYes. But that\u2019s a separate question.", "He's fine to cook for their kids. He's not fine to get upset she's not eating things he makes, knowing she doesn't like it."]}
