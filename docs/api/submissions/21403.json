Your brother is a stubborn idiot and your dad is being dumb.", "NTA - why would you want someone like that around you?  Your brother needs to see for himself how she actually is and hopefully he will come to see how horrible she is.  Don't put up with it and do what you have to do to stay away from her.", "NTA. You have the right to your feelings and not to forgive someone who makes your life miserable. It's not like you demanded they break up, you said you would not be around when gf is. You're just protecting yourself from her.", "NTA. I was wondering where your parents were in this situation.\n\nHe may be entitled to see whomever he likes, but if that person had bullied my other kids, egged my mailbox, and harassed my son, my other children, and his friends this person would never be welcomed into my home again. I would strongly advise my son that this person he was seeing has a lot of unstable behaviors and is using manipulative and isolating tactics because they are an abusive person. I'd let him know that I would be there for him but that this partner is not someone that I'd choose for him and definitely would not stand to be around my other children.\n\nAgain, where the hell are your parents?", "NTA- but ultimatums usually have the opposite effect. Be subtle and find ways to protect your brother from her. Point out when she\u2019s being controlling and terrible to people.", "NTA.\n\nBut it sounds like your brother is in an abusive relationship.\n\nWhich makes all the derision and insults I see going his way in this thread really fucked up, and definitely indicative of the bias against men in this sub.\n\nIn no way would I go to a thread that mentions a woman being stuck in an abusive relationship, and see a comment about her being an idiot, or being 'dick-struck', or anything like that.", "I always go into these looking to explain why you are the A. Here, I cannot because you are so clearly NTA.\n\nYour bro is such a loser he'd rather get JO'd by someone who vandalized his parents' home and bullied his sister than just meet someone else.", "INFO: why did you shave your head? Was it because they damaged your hair during bullying or did you do it out of frustration?\n\nAlso, is your family aware of it all, the shaving n doing school online part? I assume yes but just want to confirm.\n\nNTA either way cause you don't have any obligation towards your brother's fling. But you need to consider your relationship with brother n family if they have accepted someone knowing the trouble she put you through", ">My dad thinks I\u2019m wrong in giving an ultimatum-like situation\n\nHere, your dad is correct, but you are NTA.\n\nYou should honestly just let it play out, though, like it will. He already learned this lesson once, but apparently needs to learn it again.", "NTA, but I don't understand why your dad thinks that you gave your brother an ultimatum.  You didn't say that you would cut him off entirely, you just would not be around when she was there.  If she is as awful as you describe, this is just common sense.  Try to keep some relationship with your brother.  He may be looking for a lifeline in the near future.", "NTA. On the one hand, you have to cut him a teensy bit of slack because he is in an abusive relationship and is likely being manipulated. On the other hand, he is knowingly going back to a woman who is a danger to himself *and* his family. It's one thing to go crawling back to someone who hurts you - it's another to go crawling back to someone who hurts your family.", "NAH, unfortunately that not a \u201cyou\u201d problem, your brother is \ud83d\udc31-struck", "NTA. Continue to stand up for yourself.  This person is a bully and a controlling and manipulative human being.  \n\nThe sex must be great for your brother to put up with how she treats you and your family.", "Don't let this person cut you off from your family. You don't have to like her. From your description, she's a shitty person, but your brother doesn't care about that because she has sex with him.\n\nBut don't let her disrupt your relationship with your family. It's OK for you to just ignore her. You know she's an awful person, and you know that her opinion has no value. So it doesn't actually matter what she says or does - it's just meaningless noise.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know how there's a bunch of research and books about cult psychology? And PTSD? And dynamics around getting POW's to open up and share information with the enemy?\n\nHumans are super complicated, but we've also got deep patterns. No two lives or people are the same, but there can be a lot that rhymes, especially when you're talking about fight or flight stuff.\n\nEverything you described is a very typical, by the book example of an abusive relationship. The only thing different between your brother's situation and the typical one you hear about culturally, is that your brother is a man, and the abuser is a woman. Isolating your victim from all sources of outside support is a very classic abuser strategy... Makes it a whole lot easier to maintain a particular story about reality when there's no one there to contradict the story. Stories about who's fault a fight is, about whether or not your brother is the victim or the actual abuser, about who really loves him and whether or not anyone else could ever love him if he left, or if he could even make it without her. \n\nYour brother is a human, part of that means he makes his own choices and carries responsibility for those choices. You're NTA obviously for protecting yourself from an abusive person that's abused you in the past. Your own mental health and safety matters of course. But it's important to remember your brother is a human: next to his choices, you've got all the likelihoods and patterns about what's influencing those choices other than free will. \n\nYou've got a nasty situation on your hands. If I were you, I'd shift thinking over to how you might think about it if your brother was in an abusive cult. Might help put things in perspective to see it that way. Keep yourself safe, but if you can afford it without hurting your own mental health, let your brother know you'll be there to help him move on when he's ready. Might be good to do some reading about the dynamics of abusive relationships, what control patterns tend to look like, and what damage/recovery tends to look like. Your brother's got a nasty road ahead, and the more isolated he gets the worse it's probably going to get. It's not your responsibility to white knight and save him (you can't even if you wanted to), but it might at least be good to know what you're actually dealing with here. If nothing else, it might help with forgiving him to know why he's doing something so obviously self destructive. If possible, you might even want to see a therapist specifically for getting support as a sibling of someone getting locked into an abusive relationship... Nice thing about such a common problem is there's a lot of resources available.", "I\u2019ve tried talking to him about this multiple times and it just seems to go in one in out the other.", "Agree.
