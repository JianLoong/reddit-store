You know how there's a bunch of research and books about cult psychology? And PTSD? And dynamics around getting POW's to open up and share information with the enemy?\n\nHumans are super complicated, but we've also got deep patterns. No two lives or people are the same, but there can be a lot that rhymes, especially when you're talking about fight or flight stuff.\n\nEverything you described is a very typical, by the book example of an abusive relationship. The only thing different between your brother's situation and the typical one you hear about culturally, is that your brother is a man, and the abuser is a woman. Isolating your victim from all sources of outside support is a very classic abuser strategy... Makes it a whole lot easier to maintain a particular story about reality when there's no one there to contradict the story. Stories about who's fault a fight is, about whether or not your brother is the victim or the actual abuser, about who really loves him and whether or not anyone else could ever love him if he left, or if he could even make it without her. \n\nYour brother is a human, part of that means he makes his own choices and carries responsibility for those choices. You're NTA obviously for protecting yourself from an abusive person that's abused you in the past. Your own mental health and safety matters of course. But it's important to remember your brother is a human: next to his choices, you've got all the likelihoods and patterns about what's influencing those choices other than free will. \n\nYou've got a nasty situation on your hands. If I were you, I'd shift thinking over to how you might think about it if your brother was in an abusive cult. Might help put things in perspective to see it that way. Keep yourself safe, but if you can afford it without hurting your own mental health, let your brother know you'll be there to help him move on when he's ready. Might be good to do some reading about the dynamics of abusive relationships, what control patterns tend to look like, and what damage/recovery tends to look like. Your brother's got a nasty road ahead, and the more isolated he gets the worse it's probably going to get. It's not your responsibility to white knight and save him (you can't even if you wanted to), but it might at least be good to know what you're actually dealing with here. If nothing else, it might help with forgiving him to know why he's doing something so obviously self destructive. If possible, you might even want to see a therapist specifically for getting support as a sibling of someone getting locked into an abusive relationship...
