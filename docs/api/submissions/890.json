I told him I'd try to figure it out soon so she could move in if I move out, but I said not to mention anything so she doesn't get her hopes up. I told him I'd come back for a two week trial and make my decision. It took a week or so before I could get my shit together and make the move. \n\nNow the two weeks are up, she's basically already moved in to his room and gave up her place, but wants my room and they're being quiet and elusive (which I understand, still sucks though). I haven't seen him nearly as much as before and there was never a good time to bring up the convo. Finally he asked me a couple nights ago if I made my decision and I told him I was staying. I told them I'm cool with her staying here too, but they say they both need their own rooms.\n\nWe have a big place with low rent, in a great spot.

You've never committed to moving out, and you specifically told your roommate you needed to think on it and not to move forward with  any plans with his girlfriend. Your roommate needs to figure out what he is going to do with his girlfriend and the issues he's caused by letting her move in prematurely. On a side note does he really think it's a good idea to move in with his girlfriend of four months?", "NTA. Why does she think she needs her own room? That's what's bothering me. I think she just has some trust issues and doesn't want another girl in the house. If she needs the extra space enough to fill a whole other room, she could have just stayed at her own apartment. Wish your roommate would be a bit more assertive and communicative about all this.", "I feel like this is more of a legal situation that an ass hole one. If you're paying rent and the lease is in you're name then nothing else matters. You're not NTA either way but the contract matters most now", "NTA It's your room. Even if you decided to stay in Fiji for the winter you're still legally fine to use the space for nothing but storage during that time. He can figure out another solution with the girlfriend that will work for everyone.", "NTA. Your obligation is to yourself without taking advantage of others. The gf can request but not demand. You have the right to say no.", "Are you an AH for living in the room you pay for and never promised to vacate? No, you are NTA.\nIf they jumped the gun and moved in together, that\u2019s on them. Sounds like they need to move out and get their own space.", "NTA this is your apartment that you've lived in for 4 years. If you like living there then stay there. He's a fool for moving in a girl he's been dating for about 4 months. It's his problem to deal with. I said go to your landlord and explain it to him. And let him figure it out with the guy. But if you want to move in with your boyfriend that is your choice but do it because you want to. Not because your roommate wants you to move out so his girlfriend can have your room. Make sure you ready to move in with your boyfriend. You said you needed time to think if you should have gave that to you. Good luck", "NTA\n\nYou're the one on the lease, you're the one who decides if you move out or not.", "NTA. What does the lease say?  You paid your rent and didn\u2019t relinquish your space.  They sure are assuming a lot", "NTA, that's your room & the decision is yours to make.
