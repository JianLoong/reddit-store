He said that the dishes my mom cooked were gross and he starved", "selftext": "I come from a multinational family. My mother is a Volga Tatar (a national minority of Russia) and a Russian, my father, who died two years ago, is Ukrainian and Belarusian. My parents lived in both Russia and Ukraine, and in 2015, my whole family moved to my mom's relatives in Turkey. \n\nIn my family, all national dishes were always cooked and served on the table. My boyfriend is an American. A week ago, we flew with him to my mother in Turkey, and she made national dishes. There were dishes of Tatar, Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian cuisine, as well as several dishes of Turkish cuisine  \n\nDuring dinner, my boyfriend looked annoyed. He barely touched the dishes. My mom asked him if he liked the food. He replied rather irritably that he was not hungry. After dinner was over and we moved into my room, I asked what was wrong. My boyfriend rudely said that in the civilized world, eating horse meat is as wild as eating human flesh. (Horsemeat sausage is a national dish of the Tatars). He also said that okroshka (this dish is traditionally eaten in eastern Europe in the summer, but my mom cooked it now so my boyfriend could try it) looks and smells gross. He ridiculed all the other dishes, saying that they all either consist of potatoes with meat and dough alone, or are too 'Soviet' and were invented in the USSR during a food shortage, so they are just incongruous dirt.  All Turkish sweets were 'sweet' for him. \n\nI asked him why he was so mean, and he said it would be decent if my mom cooked some of his usual American dishes and that he was hungry because of me. \n\nAITA? \n\nMy mom just wanted him to get to know the culture of our family. There was nothing wrong with the dishes she cooked. If he didn't want to eat horse meat or okroshka, he could eat traditional Tatar triangular pies with potatoes and duck meat. There was also a whole dried goose on the table (it's very tasty) and sweets with honey. Should I really tell my mom to cook American dishes?\n\nEdit: Wow, I'm a little confused by how many comments there are, unfortunately, I can't read them all. I thought about it and decided (and the commentators helped me in my decision) that I should dump him. Not because he didn't want to try the dishes that my mother had prepared (for those who asked: there were also 'neutral' dishes at dinner like potatoes, chicken, traditional Tatar chicken soup, etc.). But because he was extremely rude to my mom and behaved rudely at dinner. My mom was upset with his behavior, although she didn't show it to him, but I know she was sad and offended. He could be rude with me or other people in the same way before, but then he always apologized, and I wanted to believe that he really improved for the better. But now I think it didn't make sense. I wish I could respond to every commenter here.

He...doesn't seem to have much redeeming qualities, right, OP? I rarely tell someone to break up, but this guy just reeks with entitlement and racism. I believe you can find a better guy who would treat you and your family better than this one.", "BREAK UP WITH HIM! \n\nmy boyfriend a very southern white man eats all of the multinational foods my family cooks after being a military brat my whole life and loving the different cuisines I got to enjoy. \n\nMy boyfriend tried hotpot for my birthday, said it wasn\u2019t his favorite but still ate it ( he enjoys the food but hates working for his food \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44).

Your bf should be an ex bf tho. I mean I get not wanting to hear horse meat, I wouldn\u2019t either, not even to be polite. But there was plenty for him to choose from. And what, is his mom going to make you Russian dishes when you go see her for a meal? Honestly he was being super rude and blaming it all on you and your family who just wanted to show him part of your culture.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is arude baby and he fits every cliche there is about americans. I understand that these traditional dishes might different to a \"western\" taste (i have been to these countries and tried some of the food) but he should have been polite enough to taste. \n\nTo demand that your mum cooks \"american food\" for him is just beyond. He doesn't respect your culture at all. Does he respect you?", "NTA\n\nIf your bf only wants American dishes, he should stay in America. Your mom seems sweet, and it sounds like she put a lot of effort into cooking a variety of dishes.\nAlso, why should your mom cook American food? He could offer to make some for your family to return the favour and introduce them to his culture? \nIf my bf acted like this, I would want an apology. That's your culture and family he's shitting on", "NTA. \n\nGet this guy out of your house. \n\nHe is rude, entitled, boorish, crass, and an embarrassment to the United States. \n\nHe also does not care about you. If he did, he would gratefully try every dish and be excited to learn about your culture. \n\nHe is also not very bright as you can't even get the ingredients you need to make traditional American food in your location. \n\nDo not waste your life with this person.\n\nEdit: lots of people are asking what is traditional American food. I love the curiosity! Here are some of the things I am talking about:\n\nFoods entirely unique to America:\n\nAny type of Cajun cuisine such as crawfish etouffe\u00e9 or jambalaya or gumbo\n\nAny type of soul food such as collard greens and fat back, cornbread with pork cracklin\n\nFried green tomatoes\n\nShrimp and grits\n\nBiscuits and gravy\n\nBuffalo wings \n\nChili (tex-mex)\n\n(Real) barbecue - meat smoked low and slow for up to 1 day like brisket or pulled pork\n\nFoods that surely other people have done before, but that Americans perfected and brought to the masses: \n\nFried chicken \n\nPizza - both thin/floppy NY style and deep dish Chicago style\n\nBurgers, of course. \n\nHotdogs, of course.\n\nThese are just a few important examples in the Canon of American cuisine. I'm sure others have more favorites!", "Your bf is an AH. Anytime a person visits a foreign country and is served several different dishes, there is no reason to not find at least a couple of items they can work with. Horse is unpalatable to you? Fine. There were plenty of other selections to choose from. He was downright rude and insufferable. You should rethink this relationship, as he showed you who he is.", "Your NTA but your boyfriend is one.

Even if you think it's gross, you smile and swallow it down as best you can, with plenty of water to wash it down.\n\nThe nasty comments afterwards just clinch it as far as his entitlement goes. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nEDIT: The people below me pointed out a couple exceptions to my stance of \"eat it anyway\". I'm not a neurodivergent picky eater or a vegetarian/vegan picky eater, just a \"raised on junk food/without international cuisine\" picky eater, so that's the angle I was talking about. And obviously, we're all still in agreement that the insulting is never acceptable.", "No, you should tell your American bf to get on the first flight back to America so he can get a \u201cdecent meal and not starve\u201d, and stay and enjoy your family and eat delicious home cooking.\n\nThe ungrateful Ugly American, with a limited palette.

Okay I know horse meat might be too much for him but he could have handled it better. Your mom made it with so much love just for your bf. She put all that effort and your bf called it gross?

I am sure he would have gone mad mad.", "As a Spanish person, I would have been HONORED to be invited to a foreign household and get cooked for. I would hsve brought wine, flowers, and many compliments, because they went the extra mile for him to try your cuisine.\n\nYour boyfriend behaved like an entitled 5yo and demonstrated an astounding lack of intelligence and perspective.\n\nNTA and a great opportunity to be single again.", "NTA. He was rude as hell.", "No, you shouldn't tell your mum anything. What you need to do is send your rude, entitled and racist boyfriend packing.\nOP, please be proud of your culture(s). Stand up for your family and your background. Do not let a boorish, ill mannered guy make you feel apologetic of your cultural makeup.\nNTA\n You will be the AH if you persist in thinking that somehow your mum and you need to cater to your spoiled boyfriend's whims. There are plenty of good people out there. You do not need this guy.", "NTA. I do wonder what you are doing with a man who has no intention of incorporating his partner\u2019s m culture or traditions into his own. \n\nHe is assuming that his traditions are the standard and everyone should accommodate them.", "NTA.

You need a new boyfriend.", "NTA and he is being disrespectful to other cultures. Basically culturally racist. Basically he can go and stay in a hotel and eat mcdonalds if that was me. Like leave him. What an asshole.", "NTA. But you sure are dating one.", "NTA. I\u2019m from the US and what your mom made sounds amazing. He\u2019s rude and inconsiderate.", "European here, why are you with this guy? Tell him to go f himself and to get himself some Mc Donald\u2019s while he\u2019s at it.

Do you think he\u2019s worth it?", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend isn't ready to travel internationally if he wants \"American\" food.  He's too immature and limited.\n\nYour boyfriend was rude and probably need to stay home until he can learn some manners.", "NTA. When dating someone from another culture/country, you get the opportunity to eat new foods.  My husband\u2019s family lives in the US, but is from Ukraine and they incorporate tons of foods into meals that I was not familiar with prior to us starting to date.  Some I like and some I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s true of food from any nationality.", "Dump him and take me to meet your family!! I'll be your best mate and appreciate every damn mouthful haha", "pack his bags and send him back. he is a goner. not worth keeping. of course some dishes you may not like or are too sweet, salty or whatever. normal thing. i also find Turkish sweets too sweet. so what? these are Turkish, made to the liking of Turks. NTA and kindly requesting to dump him.", "As an American I am disgusted by your boyfriends behavior. Please consider getting rid of him. NTA.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is rude and entitled. \nMy husband is American while I\u2019m polish. Anytime my family made polish food especially when we went to Poland. He tried everything. Sometimes it turned out he liked it other time he didn\u2019t like something. He was never rude. He just quietly told me he didn\u2019t like it. My family was never offended, I was never offended. I would make him something else or we would go out to get him something.", "I am from a similar background as you (Ukrainian) and now I reside in Canada. I grew up eating a lot of the dishes you mentioned and I happen to be a very adventurous eater so I try to try as much culture specific food as I can around the world.\n\nI would say you are NTA for not asking your mom to cook American dishes, however, if you knew that he was not super adventurous with food you could have asked her to cook some of the more \"safe\" food that is similar to American food. One example I think of is Chicken Kiev which is just fried chicken breast stuffed with butter. I can't think of anyone who doesn't like that (if they eat chicken) that is what I do when I have over someone who isn't super familiar with the normal cuisine that I cook. Making one \"safe\" dish tends to be a doorway for someone to go \"oh wow! This is tasty, can I try some more!\". \n\nOn the other hand, your boyfriend is def a bigot and I am surprised you didn't dump him on the spot. I would never let someone disrespect me or my family like that. He is small minded and should stick to dating other small minded American people who have never seen the world.", "NTA!!!! American here, and I would absolutely fuck up anything with potatoes, duck, or goose. In fact, If you want to share some recipes I'd be at my butchers posthaste. Your guy is acting like a racist embarrassment to our country and we don't claim him. Seriously, even our most \"patriotic\" (fucking gag) citizens hunt geese and duck. Horse meat is a bit unusual for us, but we have no problem slaughtering wild horses so why not? Order him an uber and send him on his way. And there is literally nothing to sweet for our corn syrup fed fat asses. He's just either picky or a bigot.", "Nta, he is disrespectful and without manners. Give your mom a hug.", "Wow!!! Your bf is outright rude and racist. Has he always been this way? NTA and your poor sweet mom. I hope you stand up to him and leave his red flagged ass.", "NTA\n\nHe is acting like a small minded bigot. \n\nHe also has atrocious manners.\n\nGet rid of him now.", "NTA. Ditch the boyfriend. Keep the food.", "NTA.\nPlease don\u2019t tell your mom to change her dishes because some snob doesn\u2019t want to eat them. \n\nPlease dump his miserable a$$! You can do so much better. There are guys out there that won\u2019t be so disrespectful.", "NTA.  You need to ditch this looser, or you're going to end up eating fast food most of your life.  There are lots of other guys out there who would jump at the chance to try a feast such as you describe.", "NTA\nYour BF is rude and a poor example of America.\nWhen I was in the navy, a chief told me that when visiting someplace, always try the local food. If you think it's gross, that is YOUR cultural inadequacy. If people eat it, it is worth trying.", "NTA. Boyfriend sounds like he's not worth your time.\n\nI remember my first stay at my husband's house before we got engaged. They served the same Christmas ham in various forms 4 or 5 times, culminating in my father in law serving me scrambled eggs on New Years with bits of week-old ham and leftover egg nog added to the eggs before cooking. It was vile. \n\nI graciously took a few bites and thanked him for making me breakfast. Mentioned it nicely  to husband after we got home so that we could have a bit more control over the food in future visits.\n\nIts ok if he doesnt like the food, but your BF is not even being gracious, and he is being disrespectful of your mom and your culture. I would not stay with someone who is acting like that.", "NTA!!!\n\nIt is such an HONOUR to be at a table like this. Homemade national dishes is such a luxury. People might not like them in the end (from the sound of it the dishes are great!) but having an opportunity to try is not an every day thing. Your boyfriend is very ignorant and outright rude.

Nationalistic and bigoted  \n\n\nYes, a lot of countries eat different meats, including some American's don't eat.  Yes, a lot of food tradition was based on economic class or poverty(some of that food, by the way, is delcious and now is ironically sold in he US at a high markup.  Places where I am at sell smoked brisket at $25 to $30 a pound, and are selling tamales at $15 a dozen).

My guess is no.", "Nta and dump his ass asap", "NTA but yr bf definitely is. Agreed with other commenters that he's rude.\n\nHe's also entitled.

What American dishes was he expecting a hamburger?", "NTA\n  As an American myself ,I am so embarrassed and ashamed of people that go to another country entirely and ridicule the food,clothes, or culture of the people.  I don't understand why so many think being American makes you in any way better than the rest of the world and then act confused about why they all hate us.

My husband always jokes about how he gained a ton of weight within a year of us dating. \n\n I would've payed to eat at your mom's house.
