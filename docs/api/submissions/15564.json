Don\u2019t assume what is normal actions in an English speaking country is acceptable elsewhere.  Learn the culture.", "Definitely NTA.   \nGood for you for (Passively, yet accurately) calling out school\u2019s admin.  They want to make decisions while avoiding any affects or repercussions.    \nIt reminds me of when I worked at Fancy Kitchen Store.  I started accurately saying \u2018decisions were made at the corporate office for product changes and policies\u2019 when customers complained.    \nA corp buyer came into our store upset and I told them \u201ccustomers are upset and blaming me for your decisions, and I\u2018m just letting them know it came from the corporate office. lmk if I\u2019m wrong\u201d.", "NTA. Who cares what they think. You won\u2019t work for them any longer", "NTA at all.", "NTA. They lied first. Since the students like you, you must be doing something right.", "You did the developmentally proper thing for the students. If admin cared, they would get that.", "nope that would *definitely* cross the line into unprofessionalism", "Thank you!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSo you just disappear some day? They didn't want to renew your contract. You just told the students when your last day would be.\n\nIf it has to be secret, well. they can put it in the contract.", "I get the feeling they didn\u2019t want to pay you extra money for having a masters degree", "NTA, in fact it was really kind of you to tell your students in advance so that they would understand you would have to leave because of the contract. The kids would have told their parents when they found out anyway, and the reaction would have been the same from both, so you did nothing wrong", "NTA They can seriously eat it", "NTA It was an AH move for them to say they\u2019d renew your contract and then not for apparently no good reason. You have the right to tell your students and prepare them to say goodbye.", "NTA\n\nFrom your comments, you would have been teaching the same students next year if you stayed on, yes? It would be weird if they showed up to school and you weren't there without having said anything.", "NTA - It\u2019s a good thing for the kids to be allowed to say goodbye.", "Don't contact the parents. This is a bit too much.", "NTA. You'd have to tell them. What are you supposed to do, just abandon them and disappear.  THAT would have been TA move.", "NTA. The AH move would be to disappear on them with no explanation. You did the right thing.", "Here\u2019s the thing, from someone in a multi-cultural family. \u201cAH\u201d is often culturally defined. If you were in the USA, I would say not at all. But I can\u2019t offer an opinion on whether this would be considered unprofessional or not in your culture. People who share your culture will be better judges of that. I assume in an American-dominated sub, you\u2019ll get a very strong N T A ruling, since in American culture, you are expected to care for yourself even at the expense of the group.", "NTA. I told my kiddos last year why I wasn\u2019t coming back and told their parents when asked. Your soon to be former admin is just salty they got yelled at.", "I mean was it unprofessional? Yes, but no not the asshole", "Yup, exactly this.", "NTA. \n\nIn any conflict between school administration and literally anyone else, I\u2019m on the side of \u201canyone else\u201d.\n\nIf you started a letter-writing campaign or something to try to keep your job, I would go for an ESH, maybe. \n\nBut this? Just explaining the bare facts of the situation, to people who need to know and have asked?", "NTA. You treated your students with respect and told them the truth. Probably one of the reasons you're so popular.", ">Dont go the individual route. Give the kids an invitation to hand to their parents for a parent-teacher conference and tell all of them there that their kids will be without a teacher in a certain subject for at least 5 weeks.  \n>  \n>Dont make it sound like you are trying to safe your job and fight for yourself personally but tell the parents what they can do so your students dont miss any educational material and all that stuff.The parents that are already fighting for you will see your compasion and might go to the school board again without you telling them anything in that direction.", "I had my 6th grade teacher disappear mid-semester. All they told me was that he had to leave. When they told our class the teacher just sat there looking sad and we never saw him again. This was pre-internet so no way to even look him up. The gossip went WILD."]}
