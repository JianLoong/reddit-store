Just say nothing then disappear? That\u2019s not fair on you or your students. But take it from me, do not stay there. Even if they change their minds because of the students. They obviously don\u2019t respect you and you deserve to be in a job where you\u2019re actually appreciated.", "NTA. You have no obligation to an administration that obviously doesn't care about you.", "Teachers are important people for their students and should have their trust. You were well within your rights to tell your students that you won't be there for much longer. The fact that the admin got backlash over that is literally no problem of yours. They are just salty they got heat for it. How is it an AH move? They didn't think twice to renew your contract, you just wanted to do the right thing. Why would anyone take the side of an administration that doesn't think twice of letting you go, despite the obvious fact you are quite popular? NTA.", "NTA you told them the truth. The school is shady.", "NTA - open communication is healthy and it\u2019s important in any relationships. Were you supposed to just let the kids wonder what happened to you when you left?  Admins made their choice and have to deal with all the consequences of that choice.  It sounds like there may be some more to this.  At any rate your not an AH here.", "NTA. If they wanted it confidential, they should have said so - but even then, unless they\u2019re giving you severance (since it was contract work, they probably wouldn\u2019t), they can\u2019t force it. You showed your students respect instead of just essentially ghosting them.", "NTA\n\nIt was right and fair for your to tell the students you would not be renewed and it was fair to let them know that it was not your choice.\n\nYou didn't ask them or their parents to intervene for you, they choose to do that themselves. \n\nAnd the administration really ought to be able to handle a challenge like this professionally. Either they have reasonable grounds not to renew (lack of budget, some issue with your performance, or something else) or they don't. It's reasonable for parents to ask for an explanation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That said, you may have crossed a non-AH line when you disclosed that it wasn't your decision and you wanted to \"keep\" them. The children and parents saw it as a matter of blame or fault, and went to bat for you. Now admin is in a corner over it and unsurprisingly unhappy for being treated as the bad guy. It was a temporary contract; they were not obligated to share their reasons with you for not renewing. You could have told the  children that you felt sad too, but you had only ever been hired on a short-term basis as a sub, and your contract was now over. You could have accepted the decision and helped your students prepare not just for your parting, but for moving on. \nI hope you find a better administration to work for and a permanent position next time.", "YTA. \n\nIf you were initally told you were going to be renewed and then they withdrew that renewal, I don't believe it happened for \"no actual reason\". It feels like you're leaving out information that would be injurious to your case because if it helped (they discriminated or gave it to a family member or some such), you would have included it.", "So the admin can break their promise but when you tell you're the bad one?\n\nNTA", "NTA and this is a blessing in disguise- you don\u2019t want to work at a school with a toxic work environment which this one definitely has", "NTA. Teaching contracts aren't confidential. I was a schoolteacher and my salary was public info, I used to urge students to do the research and the math if they ever said 'my tax dollars pay you so you work for me'. Let your admin know that it's unprofessional to not renew a contract after making an offer, and if you're willing to have a meeting, you can work through these bouts of unprofessionalism in chronological order.", "INFO: You mention you don't live in an English-speaking country.  This means that I have no idea what the norms and laws in your country are.  Can you talk about that at all?\n\nBy *my* standards, just going by what's written here, I'd conclude N-T-A.  But by the standards of the place where you are, I have no idea if you may have broken local norms, laws, or standards of ethics.\n\n(Different details with regard to that stuff might make me conclude N-A-H, E-S-H, or Y-T-A.)", "NTA. If they wanted secrecy about not renewing your contract, they should have bought it with severance pay.
