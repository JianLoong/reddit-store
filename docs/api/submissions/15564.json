Just say nothing then disappear? That\u2019s not fair on you or your students. But take it from me, do not stay there. Even if they change their minds because of the students. They obviously don\u2019t respect you and you deserve to be in a job where you\u2019re actually appreciated.", "NTA. You have no obligation to an administration that obviously doesn't care about you.", "Teachers are important people for their students and should have their trust. You were well within your rights to tell your students that you won't be there for much longer. The fact that the admin got backlash over that is literally no problem of yours. They are just salty they got heat for it. How is it an AH move? They didn't think twice to renew your contract, you just wanted to do the right thing. Why would anyone take the side of an administration that doesn't think twice of letting you go, despite the obvious fact you are quite popular? NTA.", "NTA you told them the truth. The school is shady.", "NTA - open communication is healthy and it\u2019s important in any relationships. Were you supposed to just let the kids wonder what happened to you when you left?  Admins made their choice and have to deal with all the consequences of that choice.  It sounds like there may be some more to this.  At any rate your not an AH here.", "NTA. If they wanted it confidential, they should have said so - but even then, unless they\u2019re giving you severance (since it was contract work, they probably wouldn\u2019t), they can\u2019t force it. You showed your students respect instead of just essentially ghosting them.", "NTA\n\nIt was right and fair for your to tell the students you would not be renewed and it was fair to let them know that it was not your choice.\n\nYou didn't ask them or their parents to intervene for you, they choose to do that themselves. \n\nAnd the administration really ought to be able to handle a challenge like this professionally. Either they have reasonable grounds not to renew (lack of budget, some issue with your performance, or something else) or they don't. It's reasonable for parents to ask for an explanation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That said, you may have crossed a non-AH line when you disclosed that it wasn't your decision and you wanted to \"keep\" them. The children and parents saw it as a matter of blame or fault, and went to bat for you. Now admin is in a corner over it and unsurprisingly unhappy for being treated as the bad guy. It was a temporary contract; they were not obligated to share their reasons with you for not renewing. You could have told the  children that you felt sad too, but you had only ever been hired on a short-term basis as a sub, and your contract was now over. You could have accepted the decision and helped your students prepare not just for your parting, but for moving on. \nI hope you find a better administration to work for and a permanent position next time.", "YTA. \n\nIf you were initally told you were going to be renewed and then they withdrew that renewal, I don't believe it happened for \"no actual reason\". It feels like you're leaving out information that would be injurious to your case because if it helped (they discriminated or gave it to a family member or some such), you would have included it.", "So the admin can break their promise but when you tell you're the bad one?\n\nNTA", "NTA and this is a blessing in disguise- you don\u2019t want to work at a school with a toxic work environment which this one definitely has", "NTA. Teaching contracts aren't confidential. I was a schoolteacher and my salary was public info, I used to urge students to do the research and the math if they ever said 'my tax dollars pay you so you work for me'. Let your admin know that it's unprofessional to not renew a contract after making an offer, and if you're willing to have a meeting, you can work through these bouts of unprofessionalism in chronological order.", "INFO: You mention you don't live in an English-speaking country.  This means that I have no idea what the norms and laws in your country are.  Can you talk about that at all?\n\nBy *my* standards, just going by what's written here, I'd conclude N-T-A.  But by the standards of the place where you are, I have no idea if you may have broken local norms, laws, or standards of ethics.\n\n(Different details with regard to that stuff might make me conclude N-A-H, E-S-H, or Y-T-A.)", "NTA. If they wanted secrecy about not renewing your contract, they should have bought it with severance pay. You have every right to discuss your circumstances with the students if you want to help their transition with some advanced warning.", "NTA.  I'm still in touch with my university professor \ud83d\ude43 25 years on! And we're active Facebook buddies too!", "We prefer our long-term sub teachers vanish like a fart in the night, with the children having no idea what happened to them and getting to speculate about much more dire things than \"didn't get his contract renewed.\"  \n\nNTA.  \"I will miss you guys too, this wasn't what I'd hoped for,\" is a perfectly acceptable thing to tell your students.  Substitute contracts end, it's not anything nefarious that the school should normally feel the need to hide.", "NTA\n\nYou told the truth.  Unless you were under a confidentiality clause or was complaining to your class, I don't see how you're an AH.", "NTA\n\nIf there was a reason, you are entitled to hear it.\n\nIf there was not a reason, the admin is entitled to suffer for being arbitrary and capricious.\n\nBeing able to freely talk about your employment status is an important right. We usually talk about coworkers discussing salary, but your situation is also in the same vein.", "Damn op.  Turned the class of kids into an angry mob.  Lol\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey can F off.   A good relationship, including honesty, is paramount to being a good teacher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe admins need to go back to school for refresher training.", "Nope  NTA  It's better the kids know you didn't just abandon them.\n\nGood luck", "NTA How about you were \u201cpreparing the students for a change in staff so they wouldn\u2019t be caught unawares by my disappearance from their lives, which can have such a negative effect on learning minds\u201d?", "sounds like TAPIF lol\n\nand NTA", "NTA, this is purely admin/HR/the school trying to cover their ass from criticism when they fire good staff for no reason, \"unprofessional\" here is code for \"shut up about how we're fucking you over it makes us look bad\". Having contracts like these which are all over the place is also bullshit, and you may want to look into your local teachers union to get involved in fighting the many bosses who treat you and your fellow workers like shit.", "NTA. Those admin are power tripped losers", "No. Why are they ashamed of their on decisions?", "Definitely NTA. You were telling your students the truth. They admire you for that and care about you.", "NTA and I think the students would figure it out when you don't show up.", "NTA for telling your students they'll have another teacher for the last few weeks of classes. Is there a chance the original teacher is returning? Or will they be going with a new sub who isn't familiar with the coursework?", "NTA.  But I don't know if what the parents did is right or not.", "I believe you're NTA.  This sounds like a cultural issue.  Here in the United States, it's quite common for teachers to have this kind of friendly open dialogue between students and teachers.  In other countries, their cultures usually have different boundaries and this wouldn't be acceptable there.\n\nSo while I maintain you're definitely NTA from a United States cultural perspective, you could indeed be considered an AH from the cultural perspective of that country.", "Contact the parents willing to fight for your behalf and thank them for being willing to do so but ask them to please not, because if they win the work environment would be hostile to you and you don\u2019t want to be in that position, so you won\u2019t accept the new contract.\n\nMaybe see if they\u2019ll speak to the school to give support to your decision to tell the kids because they appreciate you not leaving the kids without communication or the chance to say goodbye. It would smooth things over for you on the way out the door.", "I have no idea if you may have broken local norms, laws, or standards of ethics.", "To your questions:\n\nAs far as I know there is no law about telling or not telling students that your leaving.", "I was not complaining - I mean I complained to my mom and my boyfriend, but the students I Told something along the lines of:\n\n\u201eI just wanted to inform you, that my contact didn\u2019t got renewed, which means that I will be your teacher for the next three weeks and then you will get a new teacher. While I am sad to go, I am happy to have met you.\u201c", "HR crossed the AH line by not renewing her contract without further explanation after telling her before they would renew it.", "I mean of course there\u2019s an actual reason that the admins know about, but it could be anything from budget cuts to finding a better replacement that OP has no idea about, it\u2019s a leap to assume that OP is just lying in the post given that this sub is about taking people\u2019s words at face value then giving a judgement", "It \u201cfeels like\u201d you\u2019re assuming many facts not in evidence, and have never dealt with an uncaring employer. NTA", "I've been the manager too often when my boss decided not to extend a contract because they didn't like the way a contractor did (or didn't) speak up in meetings, or wore the wrong color blouse/tie, or so many other random things that I'm not inclined to doubt *or* trust the OP's story \u2014 it could wing either way.", "More like angry waddling penguins then a mob.", "They did not have an original teacher. I have had them since the start of the school year. \n\nThe new teacher is part of the tenured teachers but he was at school all along.", "I don\u2019t know which parents and students did it exactly. But if I find out I can do that.", "I wouldn't expect something that specific.  I was more thinking about norms or rules around developing any non-professional relationship (since what you said had nothing to do with your job) with students and/or their families.  I was also thinking about any required or expected confidentiality around your employment details.  That stuff could all vary a lot.", "For me, what it came down to was that the weapomozed their students and the students families against the administration. Generally this is an AH option, but it could be justified for the right reasons. The Op was squirrely about those reasons, so I voted AH.\n\nAnd there are plenty of examples in this sub of people calling OPs out on missing or incomplete information.", "I've dealt with many uncaring employers. But even uncaring employers usually have reasons for their decisions, especially when they're changing their minds. And far from assuming facts not in evidence, I'm pointing out where they seem to have been actively omitted.", "Agreed. Been there myself. \n\nThe reason I felt theu were less than forthcoming was that they said they had been renewed, and then it was withdrawn. There's usually something that had to have happened inbetween the renewal and the withdraw to cause ut, and that's where I feel something's missing.", "And you\u2019re assuming that the school bothered to explain. This was a decision to not renew a contract, not a termination for cause. The school could have any legal reason, or no reason.", "OPs words were \"no actual reason\", not \"they gave me no reason\". I read this as \"a reason, but not one I feel is adequate\"."]}
