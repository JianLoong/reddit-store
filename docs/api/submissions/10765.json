We split all the finances and housework evenly and haven\u2019t had any problems. Last week I got a call from my my sister (19) saying she got into a fight with our parents and asked is she can stay with us until things cool down. \n\nWhile she says with us I don\u2019t make her pay rent but she chips in on groceries and helps with the housework. Yesterday when it was just the two of us she asked if my boyfriend could find somewhere else to stay while she is here. A little background on my sister and boyfriend. My sister does not like to be around him because of her previous relationship with her boyfriend. Their relationship was toxic and they had a bad breakup. Now she can\u2019t stand to see she others in a relationship. Luckily for her all her friends are single but when I got a boyfriend she wanted nothing to do with us.  \n\nWhen she asked to stay with us I thought she had put her feelings aside. I told her that\u2019s not fair to him since he pays to live here. She says this is for her mental health and that I need to put family first. I still refused to kick him out and told her if it upsets her so much maybe she needs to go back home. She then starts crying and says I\u2019m making her miserable and locked herself in her room. \n\nOn one hand I feel guilty because I know how bad her last relationship messed her up and how things are going with our parents so I understand how stressed she is right now and it\u2019s not like he would be homeless he has his parents house.

She's 19 and trying to kick a guy out of his own home because of her trauma? She's a guest who invited herself. \n\nShe doesn't want to share space with a guy, so why did she ask to stay with you? Why not one of her dingle friends?", "NTA \n\nHe lives there. He pays rent. She is a guest and doesn\u2019t pay rent. If she doesn\u2019t want to live with him she has a couple of options. 1. Move back home. 2. Get a job and support herself in a different place. 3. Pay rent and deal with him living in his apartment. \n\nShe needs to get therapy while at it. I can guarantee you, if you ask him to leave, expect the relationship to be over.", "NTA\n\nYou would, however, be the AH if you asked someone who literally pays for the housing to move out, even just temporarily.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your sister had it rough in her past relationship, we all know what that\u2019s like. But what does she expect? For everyone else to put their lives on hold until she feels confident in her dating abilities again?", "NTA. So it's your house she's staying in, she doesn't pay rent, and she wants you to kick out someone else to lives there? She might as well go live somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are probably relieved she\u2019s gone. She sounds entitled. If anyone should go, it\u2019s the person not paying rent and who arrived later. Her being miserable around happy couples is not your problem", "NTA\n\nYour sister chose to move into *your bf's house*.  She shouldn't have done that if she didn't want to live with him.  Your sister can live with your bf, go back to your parents', or get her own place.  She doesn't get to kick someone out of *their own home* because of her issues.  \n\nIf your sister really cannot stand to see others in a happy relationship because hers was unhappy, then she needs to go see a therapist.  That's remarkably emotionally immature, and she can't expect everyone around her to remain single until she is married.", "YTA for even CONSIDERING asking him to leave.  Your sister has a TON of nerve.  She begs for someplace to say, and now wants to kick out the person paying half of her rent?!    She needs to see the other side of the door.", "So she wants you to kick out the person that pays 50% of the bills for her that will pay 0% of the bills? And I'm assuming this is supposed to be temporary? Or is she angling for you to kick him out so she can live there permanently? Based on what I read I would say NTA but some answers would help clarify things", "NTA she is no place to make demands, and obviously she's trying to wreck your relationship with your bf, she's toxic ad hell, dont ever listen to her", "NTA - that is as much of your bf's place as it is yours.  Would your sister be cool with him kicking you out for a similar situation with his sibling?  Doubt it.  Your sister needs to learn to not project her feelings from her last relationship onto everyone else's relationships.  Putting family first doesn't mean sacrificing your relationship to do so.  You're letting her stay there rent free which is beyond nice.  She can either stay with you and your bf or she can go back home.", "NTA but wow your sister is. She is seriously asking you to pick between the person who pays for the apartment and her?? Makes you wonder why she left your parents house. She is an entitled brat who needs to learn that things are not always going to revolve around her.", "NTA. Your sister is really entitled to think she can kick someone out of their own home because of her own unreasonable discomfort. Tell her to seek therapy. She needs it.", "NTA, he pays half, he's welcome to stay. Maybe speak to your bf and let him know about the conversation and how your sister feels and maybe he could give you some space for a couple of days. Kicking him out indefinitely is certainly not okay. He also has every right to just turn around and say - \"well what do you want me to do about it? This is where I live too\"\n\nOverall your sister will eventually have to get over the fact that people other than her have relationships, it's very common.", "You sister needs help", "NTA - Your sister needs to go to therapy, make amends with your parents or both. Asking your BF to leave is not a reasonable request by any stretch of the imagination.", "NTA.  \nBut let's reverse the roles. How would you feel if your BF kicked you out or thought about it, to accommodate someone from his family?", "NTA. She\u2019s getting beside herself \ud83e\udd28", "YTA if you ask him to move out.  Why should he? It's his house as well.  I can't even believe you'd entertain the thought.  Let me tell you, your sister would never do this for you.  Once she gets a boyfriend again, you'll be on the back burner.  Is your sister a man?  Because she has some pretty big balls to even ask you this.  She needs to go and now if you actually respect your boyfriend as a person and value your relationship.", "I'll answer to your title question: NTA. It's not fair that your sister acts like that to you, just because she lived hard situations that doesn't mean everyone else around her must be miserable...", "NTA. But you would be if you even consider her request  Your sister is delusional if she thinks a man should be tossed out of a home he pays for just because of her poor life choices. She's lucky he's ok with her staying there since it doesn't sound like she's very nice to him.", "NTA- this is equally your boyfriend\u2019s home and he has not done anything to your sister. Your sister asked to stay there temporarily and was aware you live with him. \n\nYou need to ask her what her long term plan is as living with you isn\u2019t a permanent solution", "Nta- you can\u2019t kick your boyfriend out of HIS home! If your sister isn\u2019t comfortable with him being there, she needs to find a new place to go.\n\nDid you even ask your boyfriend before moving your sister in??", "Nta this i a your bf home as much as it is yours. She is there by your goodwill and to an extent his as well.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t let guilt manipulate your feelings into doing what your logical mind knows is right. \n\nTell your sister that it will be far easier for her to adapt to the world, than to expect the world to adapt to her.", "NTA kick her out she has no respect for you and is trying to manipulate you", "Nta, he was gracious enough to let her stay there, at least I hope he was and you didn\u2019t just tell her she can stay without him agreeing. And now she wants to kick him out? \nNope, he lives there, she doesn\u2019t. If she doesn\u2019t like him around she can find somewhere else to stay.", "NTA. So your sister had a breakup, and now nobody can be in a relationship. Right. Totally normal! I wonder why she was fighting with her parents.\n\nIt's time to contact your parents to take her in or to tell her to go to one of her single friends. It's not working anymore.", "Um... This isn't the way for your sister to heal. She needs a therapist and possibly a screening by an MD. Storming out of your parents house and demanding that your boyfriend find somewhere else to live is far far from reasonable. So far it makes me wonder how rational she is. Hold your ground and let her know she needs to decide if she wants to stay or go back home. If she stays put a time limit on it- maybe 90 days- and make therapy a requirement for staying.  NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have your own life, and kicking him out might crater the relationship. She needs to work it out w your parents or find her own place. Staying for a few days to cool down is one thing. Let me move in and screw w your relationship so I don't have deal w parents is way over the line.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister is not only deluded for thinking you should even consider such a request but shows a level of immaturity that isn't going to improve until she learns to take herself out of her own personal tragedy to see life from somebody else's perspective. Sadly she seems to think that everything is indeed all about her.", "NTA but you would be if you consider her \u201crequest.\u201dIt\u2019s obvious she\u2019s intentionally trying to drive a wedge between you and your bf. If she is miserable about her own relationship ending badly no one else can be happily in a relationship is what is going through her mind. She needs some serious help.", "NTA. if seeing people in a relationship is that distressing to your sister then. genuinely she needs to get professional help. it\u2019s incredibly entitled and almost delusional for her to expect you to kick out your bf, who actually pays to live there, just because she can\u2019t stand to see a happy couple.", "NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s a home you live in together, how would you even go about kicking him out?\n\nYour sister invited herself to stay. This is an outrageous request from her. And your feelings of guilt suggest it\u2019s not the only time others (maybe your sister, maybe your parents) have made you feel responsible for something that is categorically not your responsibility.", "NTA. You're doing your sister a favor by letting her stay with you rent free. Your BF is also paying half the bills and splitting duties. It would not be fair or right to kick him out, even temporarily, to accommodate your sister - especially if you have no idea how long she's going to be with you. So, she either accepts that he lives there, too, or she makes up with your parents and moves back home.  She needs to grow up.", "NTA. You were kind enough to open your home to her - asking you to kick your boyfriend out is way, way over the line.", "NTA.  She needs to leave.  She expects you to pay her share of rent/bills after you kick out bf ?She needs to go and mooch off of all her friends.", "NTA\nGee. Your sister seems to have difficulty with other people existing in their homes. Don't let her make YOU feel responsible for regulating her feelings. And don't fall for her self victimization, that she's a poor shattered victim that the rest of the world should coddle.\n\nStick to healthy boundaries. Let your sister deal with the consequences of her behavior. Time for her to go back to mom and dad.", "NTA sounds like she needs to go find a single friend to stay with.

Because she had a bad relationship no one else is allowed to be in one? That's some manipulative bullshit, your trauma is not anyone else's problem but your own.

She doesn't have to enter relationships ever again, but she can't demand people around her to become single simply because it triggers her. \n\nOn the other hand, I see why it was an absolute asshole move to tell her to go back to your parents. After all, your parents are also in a relationship.", "NTA.    Why is it always the family member who doesn\u2019t contribute that says but \u201cfamily\u201d.  Nope sis can go home to mom and dad.
