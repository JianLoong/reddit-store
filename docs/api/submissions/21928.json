She's not that great of a cook but it's something I enjoy, so I do most of the cooking in the house.\n\nAmy's parents live in a different city and came to visit last week, first time in our new apartment. I spent a lot of time making a nice dinner for us, including baked Alaska for dessert. I made my own ice cream for it. Her sister also came over with her family.\n\nThroughout dinner, Amy kept making comments like \"let me know if you like it\" and \"I don't know how good it's gonna be\". I was kind of annoyed because she didn't make any of it, but whatever. Near the end of the night, her parents said they really enjoyed the food, especially the baked Alaska. Before I could say anything, Amy cut in and said something like \"I hoped it would turn out good, I asked OP what he thought but of course he can't even taste the difference between store bought and home made\". She laughed, and her sister rolled her eyes and said \"the things we have to put up with\" jokingly. \n\nAt this point I was really annoyed that everyone was making fun of me for supposedly not knowing anything about how to cook, when I'm the one that made it all. I also laughed and asked Amy \"Hey I'm sure your sister would love the recipe to the baked Alaska, why don't you tell them how you made it so well?\". Amy told me in the past her sister likes making desserts, so she and her mom both started asking her to teach them/give them the recipe. Amy said she'd text them later. I insisted and said she could send the full recipe later, just tell us the basics of how to make this. I'd also love to know.\n\nShe got pretty flustered and said something about getting the recipe from a friend, and since everyone was about to leave so the conversation didn't really get further.\n\nAfterwards she got really mad at me and said she was just making a joke, and I embarrassed her in front of her family. I said she totally discredited me and put me down. It's been pretty tense between us for the past few days because of this, and she's saying I need to apologize.", "created_utc": 1689079180, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wq9om/aita_for_embarrassing_my_girlfriend_in_front_of/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a red flag.", "Id stop the cooking altogether and go on strike.  Show her what it really means to know how t cook a meal.  After all, she claims to be the great chef in your household that can whip up a baked alaska and full course dinner.

I suggest you have a serious conversation that this is not ok, and that she must tell her parents that you cooked all the food \u2026 \n\nNTA.", "NTA at all.\n\nIm not sure what the 'joke' is. She lied to your face and is using 'joke' to try to excuse it. It wasnt a joke and you both know it.\n\nIf anything your reaction was on the mild end of possible reactions to this.\n\nYou need to apologise? Gtfo. You have nothing to apologise for. She embarrassed herself.\n\nI would think twice about cooking for guests ever again. They say no good deed goes unpunished and this is a perfect example.\n\nUgh", "NTA. Yikes. What a weird thing to lie about. Like her family doesn't know she can't cook.", "NTA\n\nShe was being passive aggressive. Seems like she is insecure that she can\u2019t cook well and was making snide remarks to stroke her own ego. Not to mention she was insinuating she made the dinner to take credit for it.

If she lies in front of you like this then how can you trust what she says behind your back? It won't stop at white lies.", "NTA - Why do YOU need to apologize?", "NTA, I am guessing her mom and sister already know she doesn't or can't cook.  Her behavior and attitude would be sending major red flags.

You will not embarrass me after I cooked for everyone. now you\u2019re trying to take credit for it and make me look bad.", "NTA, you were just getting your getback", "NTA - I cannot cook at all.

She tried to imply you had no idea about making the dessert. Does she normally try to downplay things you\u2019ve baked/cooked before? Does it come down to the expectation that she\u2019s supposed to cook and can\u2019t so is embarrassed? She owes you an apology.", "NTA.

I said she totally discredited me and put me down.\n\nNTA, because this summarizes it perfectly. All you were doing was poking holes in her little charade, but she was actively insulting your abilities while playing the part of the beleaguered woman in some mummers acts about \"traditional values.\" She rather deserved to be caught in 4k for her bullshit.\n\nNo, you don't need to apologize, because apologizing on this means you'll do more apologizing than being apologized too in this relationship. She'll come to expect it in every scenario where she's patently in the wrong. Some people might endorse that approach on the basis of, \"happy wife happy life,\" but I think you have every right to own and be proud of your culinary skills. You shouldn't have to downplay them just because your girlfriend might sulk like a child if she can't make up a story about it.", "As far as I'm concerned you're NTA here because you put time and effort into making food which was entirely disregarded by your girlfriend using a gender stereotype that men can't cook or something, to increase her own reputation towards her family.\n\nIt's still something to consider if she was actually making a joke or not,  but she should have brought it up with you before dinner if that's the case", "NTA.  She repeatedly lied and made you the butt of several sexist comments.  She should be called out and embarrassed.", "Nta\n\n\nYour girlfriend is an attention seeking person trying to take credit. Next time, don't make anything.  See her squirm.\n\n\nEven putting down your partner the way she did would give me pause. I would talk to her. She is rude af.\n\n\nSeriously, what she did was wrong.\n\n\nEven if she did cook the meal, her talking about you that way was messed up.", "I have a pet peeve for anyone who takes credit for someone else's work\n\nFor me, this is such a HUGE red flag I would be ending the relationship.  \n\nAs I said, this is a personal pet peeve.  \n\nYou certainly do not need to apologize.

She got lucky on that and owes you a very big apology and damn good explanation on why she did this.", "NTA. Not only did she steal credit for the meal, but she also put you down after doing so. It\u2019s also interesting that she was testing the waters with all those \u201cI don\u2019t know how good it\u2019s gonna be comments\u201d. Like she was deciding whether it was safe to take the credit or if she should blame you for a bad meal. And the cherry on top is that she thinks you owe *her* an apology.", "NTA she needs to apologise for taking credit for your work!", "You were more tactful than I would have been. To take credit for your hard work. The hell kind of nonsense is that?", "NTA; SHE tried to embarrass YOU in front of her family", "NTA\nDoesn\u2019t seem like a joke when she put you down the entire time. Why didn\u2019t she asked to help cook with you and then talk about working together on dinner? Or speak to you about it before??

Oh, OH made it! It's really good!: and so on", "NTA. Its weird she didnt give you credit and brag to her family about what a great cook you are. Whats going o with her?", "NTA.\n\nIt's fairly understandable that she wants to impress her family \"by any means necessary\", but she should have asked you beforehand. Or at the very least should have worded it in such a way you aren't put down so she can look cool.\n\nEven if she did it out of pure desperation, she should have apologised to you when they left because she wronged you 3 times in just one evening. Now she's mad at YOU? \n\nTime for a talk with her, my friend. Good luck. Hope you two can resolve it.", "This is extremely concerning and more than a little weird. Someone who has the gall to create a big fat lie out of nowhere and devalue her partner (who actually did all the cooking) is capable of equally shameful behaviour in the future. \n\nA partnership is where both parties make a beautiful frame to show off the other in their best light. Your girlfriend did the opposite of that and stole your light for herself. \n\nNow, apparently, it\u2019s your fault? \n\nTread carefully OP. She\u2019s just shown you who she really is. \n\nNTA", "NTA your g/f pretended the food you made was hers- pretty ballsy and was willing to let you be made fun so she feels good. A joke is when you plate take-out food and when everyone praises you, you show the receipt. I do think she was honest about \"making a joke\" -except you're the butt of the joke.", "Your girlfriend learnt the meaning of FAFO. If she didn't want to get called out she shouldn't have been saying that you had nothing to do with the meal.\n\nI'd have been proud that my partner made such a lovely dinner for my family and been bigging them up for it.\n\nDoes she often run you down in front of other people?", "NTA.  Ask her to explain how her \"joke\" was funny.", "Let her cook on her own for a while.", "NTA she outright lied and took credit. And made you look like a fool. \n\nTbh its something I'd leave over.

How is she going to build a professional reputation while taking credit for other's work seems like the thing for her to do?", "NTA - As a man who does most of the cooking at home, I really take issue with the sexist jokes about men being unable to do anything at home( cook, clean, children). The way you phrased the suggestion about the recipe gave her an opening to come clean and end it right there.", "NTA - please don't apologise. You did nothing wrong and what she did was a total AH move. If she was insecure and wanted to impress her family, she could have asked to help make it.

And it doesn't bother her at all. In fact, if you had called her out for the lie in front of her family, she'd be foaming at the mouth right now. Do you really want to be with a woman like that?

The mask is slipping.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nI know it felt satisfying, but there are more grown-up ways of dealing with her immaturity. You don\u2019t have to stoop to her level.

I'm now NC with her. \n\nDenigrating you to others while simultaneously taking credit for your hard work is a symptom of something ugly inside her, and saying it was a joke is a poor excuse. If it was a joke, she would have publicly said, \"jk, my awesome partner actually made all this food, I'm lucky to have him, y'all know cooking isn't my thing.\" You are owed an apology at minimum.", "Nta. Er, run.", "NTA She didn't want to admit to her family you were a better cook than she.\n\nWhen the answer to \"Why did you <thing> that upset me\" is joke. Then the \"joker\" is the asshole.", "NTA, this girl is has some desire to lie to her family and that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s goin away anytime soon. Super Odd behavior and should definitely be seen as the GIANT red flag that it is.", "NTA.  She had the chance to make you look great in front of her family and all she cared about was herself.  That's pretty rude and she should apologize to you.", "NTA This wildly strange behaviour. Wow.", "Hopefully, OP isn't as petty as I am because she would be making dinners for her family visits going forward.", "It might benefit to ask her why she did this. Some people come from families/cultures with more traditional gender roles where the OP being the chef de jour wouldn't be well regarded.", "This right here...OP is NTA but better be aware his girlfriend has serious issues with her family that will become issues in their relationship the longer they are together and undealt with", "I feel like OP is taking a dip in the Red Sea with this one", "That\u2019s because you are emotionally healthy. That\u2019s what we do for our partners. At least, most of us do.", "OP didn't even fully call her out on the lie, because he *could* have very easily said, \"what? [GF] you're misremembering, I cooked everything\". As it is, she just fumbled a bit in front of her family but they still probably believe she did the cooking. OP was way nicer than he needed to be imo.", "Agree. I'd be seriously reconsidering my relationship after this stunt.", "And some!", "Exactly I hate the it\u2019s just a joke trope people use to justify their shitty behavior. When the person calls them out they get gaslit. \n\nAs you said I thought he handled it quite well. She made an ass out of herself.", "I'd think twice about staying in a relationship with someone like this. Especially founding down and expecting an apology for not being a doormat.", "True seeing she did this to his face I can\u2019t imagine what she says behind his back. Yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "That wasn\u2019t a white lie. \n\nA white lie is telling someone that they don\u2019t look fat in that.", "And why do I also think she would be a nightmare to work with too, based on this?", "Next time???", "Totally. I am normally the family cook, but my wife mostly made the sides at our July 4th barbeque and I was just her sous chef, so I gave her the credit when people said the food tasted good.", "\u2026\u2026 Other Half?", "NTA and even better - this would be the a relationship ending move\u2026\nIf she is willing to go this far for something technically inconsequential- I shudder to think how this plays out over thebyears", "Very well said.", "I cant see why OP is in any way an AH here", "Bad take. She absolutely deserved to be embarrassed. Not onky was she taking credit for his hard work, but she was openly trash talking him about how he is incapable of doing the thing that he did that she was taking credit for. Tbh, she can go fuck herself. And then, she doubled down and expects an apology from him!!!!!!! Fuck no. She can go stay at her sisters for awhile until she can learn ti be a decent partner.", "Yes he did, she was belittling him in front of other people based on a lie. You can't expect an adult to meekly sit there and take it lmao", "A misunderstanding? She inferred she cooked the meal that OP cooked. That\u2019s not a misunderstanding.", "\"You could have talked to her privately\"\n\nwhy? did she put him down privately or is it okay when she does it and pretend its a \"joke\"(btw how is  \"i cooked the food and op is an idiot who doesn't cook\" funny )", "I see your point, but I feel that, if it were the case, she should have talked to him about it beforehand. All of this could\u2019ve been avoided.", "Yes. It's reasonable that you felt upset that you'd gone to so much trouble and then not only did she take the credit, but she also put you down, in front of her family, encouraging them to think you were ignorant / have no palate.\n\nI'd suggest setting out for her how upset and undervalued that made you feel, and that you feel that she owes you an apology for lying to her family about you and for taking the credit for all of your hard work, BUT that you want to understand why she did it - maybe explain that t she was worried about how her family would react if they knew you did the cooking that you would rather she spoke to you about that nd that you could agree on what you told them. Also, it sounds like you didn't embarrass her in front of the family, you let her know that you were not pleased but you did not call her out publicly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo NTA, but for the sake of the relationship, talk about this instead of getting mad with each other.", "It is one of the rare excuses that is as bad, or even worse, than 'I was drunk'.", "Ya. Wait just so he can REALLY embarrass her ass", "Yeah, other half", "Yeah and while she\u2019s with her sister she can show them how to make that Baked Alaska\ud83e\udd23", "Oh she absolutely should have communicated."]}
