Max is struggling with algebra and needs the tutoring help, so I'm depriving him of educational support he relies on.

Have you shown them the messages from the little shit? The times he's canceled? The one about seeing a movie instead? How many times you've waited for him and he was late or a no-show? The adults are fucking unbelievable. \n\nEveryone sucks except you, the adults most of all. Max has the excuse of being 13 years old and clearly never taught to respect other people's time and effort, that's on his parents.

The \"be a bigger person\" line is infuriating. \n\nHere's a question - why can't THEY be the \"bigger person?\"If they think Max is too young to be responsible for his behavior bc this is \"just a phase,\" the responsibility then falls to THEM, the PARENTS. At no point does Max's behavior become your responsibility. His parents are just sidestepping their blame and letting it land right on you. \n\nIn fact, even before the conflict in your story, I was already side-eyeing Max's parents for having you tutor him regularly without paying you. Free is fine for a one-time thing, but no parent ever expected me to watch / teach their kid anything without throwing me at least $20 per session. They always offered to pay, so I never had to ask. \n\nYou are completely right to stop tutoring. If you are willing, tell Max's parents you'll do it for pay, but they still have to pay for the sessions he skips.", "NTA   Your aunt should be consulting Max's school instructor for professional tutoring.
