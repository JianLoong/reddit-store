Have you shown them the messages from the little shit? The times he's canceled? The one about seeing a movie instead? How many times you've waited for him and he was late or a no-show? The adults are fucking unbelievable. \n\nEveryone sucks except you, the adults most of all. Max has the excuse of being 13 years old and clearly never taught to respect other people's time and effort, that's on his parents. The adults have no excuse and can go fuck themselves. \n\nStand your ground, OP. Block your aunt's number. Personally, I'd leave the room or ignore your parents every time they bring this up. \n\nNTA", "NTA, get a part time so you don't have time to waste.", "NTA. The \"be a bigger person\" line is infuriating. \n\nHere's a question - why can't THEY be the \"bigger person?\"If they think Max is too young to be responsible for his behavior bc this is \"just a phase,\" the responsibility then falls to THEM, the PARENTS. At no point does Max's behavior become your responsibility. His parents are just sidestepping their blame and letting it land right on you. \n\nIn fact, even before the conflict in your story, I was already side-eyeing Max's parents for having you tutor him regularly without paying you. Free is fine for a one-time thing, but no parent ever expected me to watch / teach their kid anything without throwing me at least $20 per session. They always offered to pay, so I never had to ask. \n\nYou are completely right to stop tutoring. If you are willing, tell Max's parents you'll do it for pay, but they still have to pay for the sessions he skips.", "NTA   Your aunt should be consulting Max's school instructor for professional tutoring.

It's not as though he's been insulting you and then demanding a favor from you, he's just checked out.", "NTA and the family should not be putting this on you! It's not your responsibility. You should also be getting paid for the tutoring. Maybe you can still do it if they pay you for your time because clearly their son is wasting your time.

If he flakes out, then it's yours for the inconvenience.", "OP's a guy, just so you know :D Completely agree with the rest of your comment!", "NTA If he needs help but behaves like that they need to pay a professional tutor. That way they will be invested in not wasting the tutors time.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'd be damned if I used so much effort and no pay", "NTA. You can tell your aunt you will continue if you get paid as maybe that will teach her and max to Respect your time.", "NTA. Make her pay for the classes beforehand, tell her that she has to pay even if he doesn\u2019t show up, because you are wasting your time.
