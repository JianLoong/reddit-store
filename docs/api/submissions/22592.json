I\u2019ve learned that while I would not be TAH for not having the sleepovers, I would be the AH in a couple different scenarios. No more expecting my kid do the entertaining. And no more sitting on the sidelines for nephew. While I\u2019m not sure which approach I\u2019ll take yet, your insights have been invaluable and I will be doing something. I appreciate the time you all took to give me your opinions on the matter. It\u2019s been very helpful. \n\nI have a nephew who is close in age to one of my kids. Nephew is a great kid. He\u2019s polite and generally respectful. Definitely not outright rude or anything like that. The issue is, he is almost 13 yrs old and can almost nothing for himself. \n\nMy sister and her ex-husband have neglected to teach him seriously basic skills. To give you an idea, my SIL taught him to tie his shoes two years ago as his parents were still tying his shoes for him. My kids sleep trained him because he was still sleeping with his mom and he wanted to be able to have sleepovers. My kids also taught him to ride a bike so he could ride around with them. He can\u2019t feed himself unless he\u2019s ordering DoorDash. I find this absolutely annoying. \n\nMy sister and her ex neglected to find any care for him for the summer. So once a week he asks to sleepover at my house. Which would be fine if he wasn\u2019t so much work. \n\nNone of his \u201clack of skills\u201d are a big deal by themselves, but I am so annoyed that once again, my sister wants other people to pick up the slack. \n\nOn top of that, my kid who is his age, gets annoyed at having to entertain his cousin. My kid is 100% ADHD so his attention span is short. He will play video games for a bit but then wants to ride bikes outside, go to the park, build accessories for his nerf gun, and so on. All his cousin wants to do is stay inside and game or watch memes on his phone. (Don\u2019t ask me how you watch memes. I don\u2019t know). \n\nOn the one hand, Nephew is a good kid and I don\u2019t want to exclude him. But on the other I\u2019m cursing my sister and do not want to help her in any way anymore. Having her kid over is very similar to babysitting a toddler. I don\u2019t want to do it. So would I be the asshole for not allowing him to sleepover?", "created_utc": 1689696605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1532nel/wibtah_if_i_didnt_let_my_nephew_sleepover/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not taking away something he is entitled to or something that you had previously promised him.\n\nYour son and your nephew are also getting to the age where their interests are starting to diverge. Being close in age may have made them natural playmates when they were younger, but they are getting to the age where it is reasonable for them to make their own decisions about which friends to hang out with. \n\nTell your sister that the weekly sleepovers are no longer working for your family.", "NTA. Weekly sleepovers even with kids who keep to themselves is a lot to ask.", "NTA to feel that way. If I were in the same situation, I'd probably take him in for the whole summer just to be able to teach him how to be more independent, but that's just me.

It\u2019s fine to be honest with your sister about your reasoning, but to him I\u2019d leave it at something like that he\u2019s welcome to come for non-overnight stays for (set frequency you determine, like a few hours twice a month), but that you guys are all busy this summer and it\u2019s hard to accommodate another person\u2019s schedule. This poor kid clearly understands he\u2019s helpless and is trying to spend more time with you and your family because it gives him the kind of skills and exposure to things he\u2019s longing for but not getting at home. If he has friends, he probably feels uncomfortable going to their houses in case something embarrassing gets revealed like the not learning how to tie his shoes thing. You he feels safe with, and while you\u2019re under no obligation to be his parent too (even though he probably wishes you were), you also don\u2019t want to make him feel like he can\u2019t come to you in a real crisis (a thing teenagers will do if they sense the slightest bit of rejection because they\u2019re teenagers). Respecting gentle boundaries someone sets with him is another important skill for him to learn, and so long as you\u2019re gentle about it, there\u2019s no reason you\u2019d be an AH.", "NTA, and he's not your responsibility in any way, but it might help if you stop looking at it as helping *your sister*, and start looking at it as helping *your nephew.*\n\nLike I said, you are not responsible for him, but his parents have set him up to fail, and you say he is a good kid, and you care about him. It couldn't hurt to teach him life skills since otherwise, he's not likely to learn them.\n\nYou're NTA, but I really feel for the kid that nobody is stepping up for him.", "NTA 5 or 6 this would be understandable but 13 years old and can't take care of basic necessities. that's way too much responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe them anything and it doesn't seem like your child is interested in it any longer so you'd be doing them a favor.\n\nSounds a lot like my sister and nephews situation.

I have recently gone very LC with my sister and its been the best thing for me mentally", "NTA if your nephew is not easily fitting in with your own children.  It's not really fair for your son to have his cousin inflicted on him weekly if they don't have the same interests. I feel very sorry for your nephew and contact with your family is probably very good for him, but if it's too much of an imposition, then that is just how it is.  Maybe spacing out visits would be a good compromise for the nephew.  \n\nI do realize how you resent assuming your sister's responsibility for her son, but that is a separate issue.

Your kid should not be made to entertain him so you gat an A for that.  You babysit, it is your job to keep track of him and, if all he wants to do is game and play on his phone, it is not that hard for you.  Your kids have taught him plenty.  Why can't you take one day he is there and teach him the basics he does not know?", "Mixed. YMBTA  in a small way because you say he's a good kid but you are not willing to do a few simple things to help him overcome having lame parents. Total NTA because your kid should not be forced to have weekly sleepovers with someone he doesn't like. Maybe you can compromise and have him over less often.", "INFO:\n\nI find all of this very difficult to believe and troll-bait-y, but particularly this, which makes no rational or logical sense on the face of it:\n\n>My kids sleep trained him because he was still sleeping with his mom and he wanted to be able to have sleepovers. \n\nWhat do you mean \"\\[your\\] kids sleep trained him\"?\n\nSleep training, as one does it with an infant or toddler, implies literally ACTIVELY TRAINING a baby to self-soothe, usually so that they can sleep by themselves and/or on a schedule. I get that you're saying that he slept with his mother at home, and that at your house he would have to sleep in a bed by himself . . . but other than literally having him do that (sleep in a bed by himself), what are you suggesting that a couple of kids under the age of 13 at the time did to \"sleep train\" him? The very assertion seems ridiculous. They \"taught\" him to self-soothe when he cried for his mum? They actively \"taught\" him to sleep by himself using specific techniques recommended by doctors or psychologists?\n\nEither you're grossly exaggerating, or you don't actually know what \"sleep training\" is, because just having your kid sleep over by himself when he usually slept with his mum, or explaining to him that he would sleep in a bed by himself at your house is . . . well, that's not \"sleep training\", and it's a ridiculous assertion.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n>My kids also taught him to ride a bike so he could ride around with them. \n\nOkay, so what? Lots of kids don't know how to ride bikes because they don't own one. Many people make it to ADULTHOOD without knowing how to ride a bike. That's . . . not a shocking or horrifying thing. In fact, it kind of speaks to your middle class privilege that you think that it is.\n\n>He can\u2019t feed himself unless he\u2019s ordering DoorDash. \n\nAgain, what do you mean by this? He can't use a fork and knife unless the food he's eating came from DoorDash? Well that seems unlikely. \n\nOr do you mean that at not-even-13 years old HE CAN'T COOK OR MAKE FOOD? Because while that's unfortunate, and it's true that most kids that age can at least make some toast or cereal or whatever . . . not being able to COOK as a child (yes, even as a pre-teen) also isn't exactly shocking or horrifying. I couldn't. My sisters couldn't. I know LOTS of kids who couldn't, not because we were spoiled (at all, in fact . . . my parents were strict AF) but because we grew up with old-fashioned mothers who didn't want kids messing up their kitchens, and it never occurred to them to teach us how to cook anything. We learned in our late teens or as adults, the same way they did.\n\n>I find this absolutely annoying.\n\nYeah, you're a massive AH. While some of your complaints are valid, a lot of them are just mean-spirited assholery. Yes, this kid has obviously been coddled, but also a lot of what you're complaining about isn't even abnormal. \n\nYou don't have to let him sleep over, but I find your assertions difficult to believe and they make you seem like an unreliable narrator.", "Information: you mentioned leaving someone out - do you have other siblings and are other cousins sleeping over?", "She isn't going to change regardless, tbh.", "I agree.", "Thank you. I was thinking the same thing. Especially about interests being different. But obviously worried that because I was already annoyed by her, I was being unfair.", "Agreed. Haha", "I honestly considered it. I feel like this kid deserves so much better than he\u2019s getting. But his mom and dad are more than capable of teaching him. So then I argue with myself about inconveniencing myself (I work from home) to enable their behavior. Ugh.", "So many good points here. Thank you.", "You make good points. I do need to adjust my mindset on this. Your last sentence is like a gut punch. I\u2019ve said that exact thing about other situations and here I am, in the middle of one I can actually help change. Shm. Yup. Gotta do better.", "Yes. Exactly. There has historically been a lot of exactly what you\u2019re describing. It\u2019s a lot of the reason why I\u2019m struggling with this now.", "You suspect, correctly. I appreciate your thoughts and response. Thank you.", "I do worry about the resentment.", "Thank you for that. You have a solid argument.", "Oof. You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t like myself as you\u2019ve described it. Appreciate the call out.", "You\u2019re the second person to say I should be the one entertaining my nephew. I did not realize that was a thing at this age. I mean I totally did when he was younger and I babysat but I figured because he was older, that would be the WORST for a teenage boy. \n\nBut you make a good point. It\u2019s definitely not my sons job. I\u2019m going to brush up on my video games for starters. Go from there.", "I need clarification and I swear I\u2019m not being an ass to you: If he is my sons age, and coming over essentially to hang out with my kid, should I really be expected to entertain him? I honestly hadn\u2019t considered that. \n\nYour question is definitely a huge part of it. Why don\u2019t I just teach him? Honestly? I don\u2019t want to. And THAT is super asshole-ish. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit. But I simply don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t like that I can be that asshole-ish about teaching him. I may need to just suck it up and call myself out for being an asshole on that part and just do it.", "How is he TA for turning down weekly babysitting duty", "I appreciate your point. He is a good kid. There has gotta be a balance I can find here.", "You're just trying to find things to be upset over.", "1. My kids stayed with their cousin at this house for a few days. Two of them rotating, the entire thing was probably 5-7 days. During that time they taught him what to do when he became scared or asked for his mom. They sat up with him talking to him, comforting him, and helping him get back to sleep when he woke up scared. They walked him through the steps of self-soothing. Relaxation techniques to calm your body, etc. I am not sure why you think children aren\u2019t capable of teaching each other these things. \n\n2. He wanted to learn to ride a bike. He had a bike. What he lacked was someone to teach him. \n\n3. He will actually not eat food that is not made for him outside of a bagel. He will make himself a bagel. So if he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019ll say \u201cMoe, can we order food?\u201d I\u2019ll say there\u2019s food in the fridge/pantry and give him options. He will choose to not eat and go home starving and saying he wasn\u2019t fed. \n\nI hadn\u2019t considered myself an asshole for being annoyed my sister didn\u2019t teach her sons skills. I find abhorrent to neglect your child in such a way that he can\u2019t peel a banana. If you\u2019re wondering how this kind of thing happens, I\u2019ll tell you. Two middle-to-upper class individuals: a mom whose made her only son her emotional support pet and a dad who would rather buy his son crocs (or tie his shoes himself) than teach the kid how to do it himself and BOOM: a dysfunctional 13 yr old whose only fault was being born to two people who would rather pay someone to do the things for them, than teach their kid to do it for himself. It happens way more than it should. I mean, look at the adults in todays world. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut you might be somewhat right. That last paragraph I wrote is super asshole stuff. Super judgey too. I\u2019ll own it. I am judgmental of how they\u2019ve raised their son. And I know I shouldn\u2019t be.", "My apologies, that is confusing. I meant exclude in the general sense. As in I didn\u2019t want to say he couldn\u2019t come over.", "You also have to think of your son's welfare.\n\nIf he's getting frustrated it isn't good for him.", "No\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFair would be: One sleepover with you, one with them. But your son isn't interested.", "You would not only be inconvenienced so will your kids.\n\nYour family doesn\u2019t deserve to be inconvenienced by your sisters lack of parenting skills.", "I want you to be aware I'm not coming down on you. Your first priority needs to be your kids, but I just feel so bad for kids who have nobody who is willing to go to bat for them. His parents should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to get anywhere near this point", "My mom always but her nieces and nephews before us. We where made to play nice. Not complain. To this day I don\u2019t talk to any of my cousins!", "\" I should be the one entertaining my nephew. \" .. YOu should be doing it in the sense of: Don't expect your son to do it. HE did not invite the nephew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnot in the sense: He needs entertainment. But in the sense: Allow your son to close the door of his room and keep the nephew outside.", "My son would go over there for sleepovers. But my sister won\u2019t have them over there because she has to go into work the next day and doesn\u2019t want them home alone. Which makes sense.", "I truly appreciate your words. I didn\u2019t feel like you were coming down on me. I think it\u2019s been hard for me to see it as \u201cgoing to bat for my nephew\u201d and not \u201cenabling my sister.\u201d I have been biting my tongue in the interest of keeping the peace, and that is just so stupid. Especially when a kids lifelong ability to function is being fucked up. I definitely needed to hear all this from everyone today.", "Gotcha. I get what you\u2019re saying.", "Sometimes, I'm going to bat for someone can mean enabling someone else, but you need to decide which is more important to focus on"]}
