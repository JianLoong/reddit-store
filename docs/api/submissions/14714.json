You should re-evaluate and actually consider just speaking to your wife and laying down what you expected from her as a spouse (being included in the decision to purchase a new expensive vehicle) .

If the roles were reversed, she would be furious - and I'd have never done it anyway!", "It may be. Or she may be concerned he is planning on divorcing her (Note how fast he jumped immediately to divorce). She bought a car that is in her name only and the remainder of the money in an account he can't access. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have spent money on a car, but, given their 2 new cars are not new per his comments, it may have been a good idea to have a fully warrantied car, in her name only, if he dumps her.", "okay\n\nbut it\u2019s equally possible to have separate assets within a marriage and still be in a happy marriage? one doesn\u2019t preclude the other\n\nplenty of happy marriages have worked that way for decades in my experience", "My wife and I have been together for a decade. If I inherited $100,000. I would definitely get her input on what to do with it. I probably wouldn't buy a third vehicle without at least talking to her first. \n\nI view marriage as a partnership. Spending $40,000 on a new car that they might not need is kind of ridiculous. It would have made more sense she would have traded her current car in. And then bought a new car.", "If you don\u2019t drive a car, you don\u2019t add a lot of maintenance.", "If I were her, I would pay for the insurance policy separately. If it is a multivehicle policy, I would just pay the whole thing myself.", "You understand this isn\u2019t a legal subreddit, but instead asking if someone is the AH?  There are plenty of things that are legal, but also make you an asahole.", "He did the garden and the bathroom..... And repaid the loan that bought the house..... And yeah I wasn't mad!", "Why? It has no impact on his life?", "Yes I agree the decision to buy the car is a discussion. I think a partner can offer input on which car to buy but does not specifically have to be involved in which car. The discussion on buying the car should include price range so a partner can't say they are looking at a 30k car then buy a 100k car.", "Well based on OPs comments that\u2019s what\u2019s insinuated. Can\u2019t really take anything else into consideration besides the information that is given.", "If you look at OPs post history, he posted in swinging forums recently; chances are, there is more reasoning behind his wife's motives. Not saying all swinging marriages end in divorce (I know many swingers who are happily married) but there can be a ton of jealousy that causes tension if one partner is placating the other.", "I don't think what she did made her an AH. She used 1/3 of her inheritance on a car she wanted. The remainder is in an account she controls. Given he is talking divorce, I think she made a very wise and smart move.", "So he made purchases that increased the value of your shared home purchase, as well as paid off your shared debt on the house, directly financially benefiting you.\n\nDo you not see any difference in buying a 3rd car between 2 drivers?\n\nDid your spouse honestly hire a contractor without ever consulting you on his plan to remodel?", "It clearly had an impact in how he felt valued in their relationship for her not to involve him."]}
