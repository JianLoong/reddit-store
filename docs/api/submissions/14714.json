My ex husband was horrible with money (he was also abusive), so I'm probably biased, but it's devastating to have your spouse waste money when you're already struggling. There were many times we received a large amount of money that he would quickly waste on an impulse buy while my card got declined at the grocery store or I was stressed about getting our kids birthday gifts.
