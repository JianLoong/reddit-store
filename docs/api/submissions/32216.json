My dad was an awful person. After that the rest of the family pretty much cut us off. Then I got pregnant @16 and further solidified my outcast status. \n\nNo one in my immediate family ( mom, step dad, brothers, etc) have been invited to any type of family get together since childhood. I see my aunt's, uncle's, and cousins often but they only speak if you put them on the spot. They do act \"nice\" with pleasantries if I speak to them but that's about it. They don't know any of my children's names nor do they know the names of my spouse or any of my siblings spouses or children. I mean I can at least tell you who their spouses and children are ffs. \n\nI own a small business and several times I've had a family member come in and not even acknowledge my existence. I assume they only come because I am the only garden center in town so they have to unless they want to drive to the city and hour away. \n\nHonestly it's fine they aren't exactly people I'd want around my children. They are the type that act like they are better than everyone else. \n\nHowever my grandparents are not in good shape at all. This will probably be their last Christmas. My grandmother decided she wanted to host Christmas and she wanted everyone there. I assume she wants to make amends or something. Idk.\n\nI was thinking about going just to see what's up but they have never once cared about me or anyone in my family so I've decided to not go. I know my mom is wanting to go just to see her parents one last time ( I assume my stepdad is going to go to support mom) and one of my brothers is planning to go with his wife but no one else is going. \n\nWe will still be doing the regular Christmas with the immediate family so I don't feel like I will be missing out on something. They have all been awful to my family and I don't feel like I owe them my presence nor the presence of my children. \n\nHowever my husband thinks I am going to regret not going and thinks we should go even if it's just to support mom in going. \n\nAnyway one of my cousins that I haven't spoken to in years called me angry saying that the family is trying to extend an olive branch on what's possibly the last years of my grandmother's life. She wanted to know why I was refusing and making everything difficult and about us. \n\nI don't think I'm making it difficult or about us at all. We've been excluded from everything since my own childhood. They don't even know my children's names or what they even look like. Why invite us now?\n\nI'm probably being an AH but idk what do y'all think?", "created_utc": 1701558469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189fn2y/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_the_family_christmas/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
