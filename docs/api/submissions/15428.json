Not you.  \n\nRespect your daughter over your ex.", "NTA, your daughter is old enough to decide who she wants at her celebration; and the mom's lack of foresight and planning is the mom's fault, no one else's.

That is a crap move by the mom.", "NTA. Your daughter gets to decide who to celebrate with and she must have her reasons for not wanting them there. Mom showing up to insert herself was thoughtless when clearly it's your daughter's time with you. Are the mom's other children half siblings? Are they much younger and annoying to your daughter?

Simple.", "NTA.\n\nSixteen is plenty old enough to decide who she wants at her birthday celebration, including those she *doesn't* want.

It sounds like she and her mother (and likely her siblings) have a rocky relationship, so it's understandable why she wouldn't want them around at a time where she's supposed to be happy and having fun.", "NTA. Her mother (your ex?) should have contacted you and asked if her \u201csurprise\u201c would conflict with any plans already made. Mom/Ex sounds very self-centered. Good job standing up for your daughter.", "\"I strongly encourage you to have your own celebration with our daughter, just not during the celebration she's having with me. It's not fair to put her in the middle of *our* conflict, especially on her birthday. And in the future, it's probably best to make plans with her ahead of time, rather than surprising her... She's 16 now, and she often has her own plans that she won't want to disrupt for her parents.\"\n\nNTA. And based on your other comments, I realize that the potential conflict is likely to be between your ex and your daughter--rather than your ex and you--but framing it the way I suggested helps take the burden off of your daughter.

So if you just tell the mother no she can\u2019t come without any reason I think you would be the asshole despite doing it to protect your daughter.\n\nSo I would have the discussion with you daughter that she is 16 now so should be the one to tell her mother no and then go from there.", "INFO: why doesn\u2019t she want her mom there?\n\nedit: NAH, it doesn\u2019t seem like your daughter is ready to have a relationship with her mom for whatever reason. and that\u2019s okay", "Question- your daughter was surprised, but did you know her mother was coming into town? When did you find out?", "NTA, but your daughter is letting you look like one.  If she has these feelings toward her mother but won't let her know,  it seems suspicious.  I wouldn't force my daughter when we had a few of these situations,  but she was manipulating her father and I.  If she is going to burn that bridge, then make sure she realizes that her mother will know she held that match.\nHowever, what would save everyone's feelings is to have her spend time together doing a different activity.
