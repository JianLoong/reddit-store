Each pay around 600 a month for the apartment. Now that I gave you to general context I will tell you the problem.\n\nMy girlfriend lives 45 minutes to an hour away (depending on traffic) and since neither of us want to drive that way back and fourth every time we see each other I tend to sleepover. Most the time I sleepover on the weekends, and 1 day of the week day depending if I have early work the next day or not. \n\nAnything I use at this apartment is either something I buy or my girlfriend buys. If I make food, its food I buy and make with or for my girlfriend. If I poop, I use toilet paper I buy, if I drink any sodas, its sodas I buy. Anything I use I have either bought or my girlfriend has in the past. \n\nMy gf has never asked me  to pay rent, because she knows that it\u2019s unreasonable, I am only there for her, not because I need to live there. I sleepover to spend time with my girlfriend, not because I want to live in an apartment away from my parents.\n\nYesterday my gf\u2019s best friend (the roomate) surprised us and said she wants me to start paying the same as all of them to make it fair. And I said No. She claims I was at their house for 25 days last month, and when I had proof to show her that is completely wrong, she decided to deny my proof and say she knows what she saw. The proof was me calling my mom who I see daily and live with and asking her do you think I slept at my gfs apartment for 25 days last month, and my mom laughed saying if you slept there for 25 days last month you must have twin brother here. The roomate stormed out and says she knows what she saw.\n\nAITA here? Like I have nothing in the apartment that belongs to me, I go there for my gf, shes my best friend and we love to spend time together, why should I be paying for that time when my gf already pays her part? Not to mention they have a bigger room and extra room than my gf and they all pay the same. Also my gf does not want me to pay rent because she thinks it would be unfair due to the amount I already spend on us (I buy mostly everything when going out)", "created_utc": 1689860097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154r4e5/aita_for_not_paying_rent_to_my_girlfriends_roomate/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s a fucking scam.", "NTA. But sheesh, your gf is being taken advantage of. They have 2 out of the 3 bedrooms and she is paying the same as them? Big no for me.\n\nAlso, I'd say the roommate is bringing this up because she thinks you are there too much.

You said they each pay around 600 a month but BF and roommate should be paying more since they have the bigger room and the game room no?\n\nI think NTA, the reality of living with roommates is that you can't ban them from ever having their SO over, you can only ask that they split the time equally between places. \n\nIf you are only over there max 3 days a week and not just hanging out all day in the apartment, and you are buying food and toiletries to use while there, I think your Gfs roommates are being unreasonable. However, I do think you could alternate weekends or at least weekend days. It does become annoying if someone who doesn't live there is over on the only days you have free time every week, so I would talk with your GF and then reiterate to the roommate that you are NOT there 25 days a month, but that you are open to alternating weekends that you spend there?", "X- how many days *did* you spend in the apartment last month?\n\nEdit after seeing that you spend half the month there\n\nYta\n\nYou don't need to pay rent, but you need to spend less time there. In sure your gf wants to see you a lot, but the other 2/3 of the place seems to be getting very tired of you being there every weekend when they are prly trying to relax. \n\nYou and gf need to switch off on where you stay and not just stay at the place she shares with other people.", "NAH - You're staying over, by your own admission, \"weekends\" plus another day during the week; so most likely Friday, Saturday, and sometimes Sunday night plus another night during the week? That's half the week *every* week. \n\nIf you're there half the week, you're a third roommate, and it's not actually unreasonable for your GF's roommate to expect you to pitch in on the rent; you're there. You're using the space, too. \n\nNegotiating the amount is a different question, but there are functionally three people living there when this person only originally agreed to two. \n\nIt's not unreasonable for you not to want to pay rent. It's not unreasonable for her to not want you basically living in the apartment for free half the month.", "ESH - staying over 3 days a week is pretty substantial and its reasonable to ask you to start contributing.

Thus saving her and her boyfriend $150 each?    \nThat is a more reasonable discussion but not by much.  \nBreak it down even more 1800/30 is 60 a day.  \nAssuming you spend 15 nights (thats half the month).  That\u2019s 15 nights at $20 each for three and 15 nights at $15 a person for 4 .  That\u2019s $525 for those three and $225 for you and your nights.   \nDoes her friend really want to make a deal over what seems reasonably at $75 a month?  When you have no stuff there?    If the answer is yes then it\u2019s yes and sit down and talk it out.   And start moving stuff in, ask for a key, start paying and treat the space more like yours.   \nUtilities covered or are those separate?  \nIf you want to do the math do on those then do the math or just pay 1/4th that could really turn into splitting hairs.   \nPersonally if I were you or the best friend neither that nor the rent as a whole I\u2019d be really worried about but I am not either of you nor do I know the financial case of anyone involved.  \nThey have reason to want you to contribute seeing as you are there but at the values it works out too make it out to be a really nit picking level.  \nI\u2019d bring up a creative solution.  Like you bring or cook dinner for everyone once a week when your there, or you bring a case of beer or soda that\u2019s free game for everyone. Other ideas could be like oh you guys need a new coffee table I\u2019ll get that.    \nAnd the end of the day and end of life your are using a resource they are paying for but life\u2019s to short to worry about every nickel and dime.

I'll admit them asking you to pay the same amount as they do is insane but giving em somehting like $100 or $150 should be good. It's not just your girlfriends space it's their space also.

Y'all would be saving money in a 1 bedroom together.", "I wouldn't say YTA but you're there 3 days a week. \n\nWhen you're there the weekend are you there for the whole weekend or just sleeping there at night? Same when you're there mid week, is it just to sleep or are you there for a portion of the day?\n\nIf you're spending a set amount of time there each week, I'd hate to break it to you but you're part time living with your GF so I would say you should contribute towards rent. But not a fair share as has been suggested. A reasonable amount to cover the two/three days you are there.", "Just your presence would annoy me.  They didn't sign up for a 4th in their house especially all weekend.", "Hard for us to say\n\n25 days is a lot. If you didn't sleep there for that many days last month, how many did you in fact sleep there?\n\nI ask this because the real number must be somewhere close to 25 (she can't have plucked 25 from absolutely nowhere). Even if it's just 15 days, that is still a lot of days for you to be staying over. In which case, I don't blame them for feeling you're staying over too many days in their apartment. Although you cook your own food and use your own toilet paper, you still are using a significant amount of their facilities - like their kitchen, their bathroom, their lighting, their water, etc\n\nI agree that them asking you to pay the exact same rent as them is unreasonable\n\nHowever, they can't be blamed for noticing you staying over at their place far too often", "Idk if YTA as much as you're coming across as a bit childish but yes. If you're there for 3/7ths of the week every week it's definitely reasonable for them to ask about you contributing to rent. \n\nSurely paying a bit of rent there is still preferable to driving?

Is it split 3 ways, between roommate, rm boyfriend and your GF? \n\nIf so, YTA. I don't get your argument that you only use the stuff you pay for. So does the roommate and her boyfriend? Right? So why would you get all the perks of staying overnight half the month by your own admission but not pay rent like the rest of them?\n\nPart of the rent includes being comfortable and respected in your home. If someone was in my space and not paying for it like I do I'd be uncomfortable and disrespected. \n\nIf It's split between your girlfriend and just her roommate, I don't see why it would now be split to 3.", "You should pay something.
