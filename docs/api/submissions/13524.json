As we were leaving the house my 12 year old was wearing pajamas and we asked them to change into something more appropriate.  Of which they responded with \"I have nothing to wear\" and outright \"no\".  We ended up helping them find more appropriate clothing with a lot of yelling and stress for both parents and all kids.  The kid had just done laundry... They literally had nothing dirty.\n\nI'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.  They already have lost phone (tied to grades), tv (it's a rarity in general).  Don't want to cut out extracurricular (team sports) due to the commitment to the team.  Not sure what is appropriate consequences would be.\n\nOn the drive to church, tried talking about it... Just wanted a simple I should have just changed when asked... But they refused to talk.  In frustration, I told them that I'm taking away all clothes except one parent approved outfit every day.\n\nAm I the asshat for taking away clothing for an undetermined time period for something this silly.", "created_utc": 1680126636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1261uwh/aita_for_taking_away_clothing_choice/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was viciously bullied at church and would get out of going by being sick when I was twelve.", "YTA. Mate, chill out. The more extreme you get, the more your kid will act out.", "Based on the punishments, YTA, and I would be willing to bet I know why they're acting out. \n\nThat being said- you can't think of one reason WHY they didn't want to get dressed? Do they not want to go to church? 12 is certainly an age when kids can decide what they do and don't want to do.", "Yta\n\nYou seem pushy af and if he is rebelling already good luck having any control over him at 16. The problem isn't that you need to punish him more it's that you need to see that your parenting strategy is really poor.\n\nDid you consider that he maybe didn't want to go to church? Although I doubt this is an option for the kid.", "YTA. When you literally run out of things to take away from your child it might be time to reflect on how effective your approach is.\n\nFrom your post, it does seem you are more occupied with the audacity of your kid telling you \"no\" than you are with understanding what's going on with the kid not wanting to get dressed. I can understand why they don't want to talk about it with you if, for you, the main goal of such a coversation is \"getting a simple I should have just changed when asked\". \n\nIt's nice to give kids structure and dicipline, but they also need love, understanding, and above all, respect. Your post reads like the things are contingent on their obedience to you. I would not be surprised if this makes it very hard for them to respect you back.\n\nThat you consider holding their team sport activity hostage to force them into complacency and the fact that respect for the team, not your kids developmental needs, is what swung it for you worries me greatly.", "YTA. You really can't figure out why your kid is rebelling against your super strict rules? Did they even want to go to church? Have they ever gotten to choose their own look for clothes? Or if they want to go to church activities?", "INFO:  What do you deem appropriate for them to wear to church and why did they resist wearing it so much?", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s just church. Make sure they aren\u2019t in anything offensive and clothing\u2019s clean - that\u2019s all that matter. \n\nYour kid is likely rebelling because not everything needs a strict punishment.", "Yta- taking way clothing choice is you saying you are the only one right here. I do not agree with the child\u2019s attitude but they are that a child. If this is a forced thing for the kids this is their way of rebelling. Let them have their choices but explain to them it has to be appropriate. Also LISTEN to your kids if they say they do not want to go every Wednesday.", ">I'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.\n\nMaybe try listening to your child as to why they don't want to go to church? Or don't, bur don't be surprised when kiddo leaves at 18 because you were too busy finding ways to stroke your ego. \n\nYTA", "YTA - my parents were like this and I am now no contact with one and low contact with the other. There are way worse things than wearing pajama bottoms.", "YTA. There is so much that's wrong here.", "YTA\n\nParent of a 14yo here. My child wears the absolute WORST clothes to school. Hoodies three sizes too big, pajama pants so long they puddle at their feet, basket ball shorts over sweat pants, sweaters with suspenders, socks with sandals - I don't know dude. \n\nIts an everyday struggle for me and my 'well adjusted' sensitivities, but we don't shame our kid about their choices and as long as its respectful of the environment, not vulgar or graphic, and the private bits are covered we let that shit go man. Our kid has juvenile arthritis and sometimes their clothing choices are made as a result of that as well. Maybe your child was having a bloated day and didn't want the pressure of a regular pants waistband? \n\nUltimately it likely boils down to you being worried how you (or your parenting) will be judged based on what they are wearing and thats a very unimportant thing when stacked up against teaching your child to be their most authentic self. \n\nPrehaps if you had approached the situation with a little less 'do as I say' and a little more 'I support your judgment', your kid wouldn't have shut down and taken conversation with you as a threat. \n\nPersonally I would have had an out of body experience if my child tried to attend church in pajamas but I was raised in a toxic af environment and am actively unlearning those behaviors, also we are Buddhist.", "YTA for two major reasons. \n\n1. You're policing what your kid wears to the point of punishing them with taking away the phone and tv and also all their clothes except the singular outfit you approve. You are taking away their creativity in their outfits and literally showing them that other people get to decide what they can or cannot wear. If any of your children are girls, you might be setting them up to be open to being criticized by people for her future outfit choices and feeling like she has no right to say no. Unless they want to wear a bikini to church, who cares if they wear pajamas?\n\n2. As someone who grew up in an evangelical community (your choice as a girl if you didn't want to go to church on Sunday was to go help in the church's daycare during service, but not going to either was not an option) and also have a theology degree, you're being prideful. You care what other people think about how your kids dress. You want to present well to others, not to God. God is with you 24/7 365 days a year. God sees you naked in the shower, when you're having sex, when you're in your PJs eating popcorn and fried chicken, when you look like shit from illness, when you gave birth to your kids etc. God does not care what you wear to worship Him. YOU care. You care what others think of you and how you think your kids' outfits reflect on you. If you take a step back, ask yourself what your outfits tell you about your faith. Do you think having your girls in floral dresses and your boys in polos and slacks (or a small cutesy tie, shirt and slacks) is going to bring them closer in their relationship with God? Or do you think the fact you traumatize them every Sunday is going to harm their desire to go to church? I have a hunch they dread the fight on Sundays and the fact they have to wear something they don't have to wear 6 other days of the week. I can assure you that God does not care what you or your kids wear to church. There are churches around the world where people come in their every day clothes to church which could include greasy clothes, stained clothes, suits, fast food restaurant uniforms, etc. Remember the TRUE purpose of church - it ain't a fashion show or a red carpet for best dressed.", "It sounds like a lot of work is going into punishing your kid. Who cares what they are wearing, really? This type of pushback is common for that age and you really have to choose your battles. Disrespectful behavior is out of line, but IMO letting them experience the natural consequences of wearing jammies to church is a better use of your time. NAH because it sounds like typical tween shit. But YWBTA to yourself if you spend a lot of time focused on punishment. Honestly, they grow out of it.", "YTA You should punish him by making him miss out on Wednesday indoctrination.", "YTA punishment is extreme. Just let them wear what they want", "YTA. An appropriate consequence for your kid delaying you by not being able to pick out a church outfit would be to require them to start choosing and laying out their clothes the night before. \n\nThis is also worth talking with your kid about to figure out what was going on. Were they just trying to get out of church? Are they growing and their clothes don\u2019t fit well? Do they hate all their formal clothes? 12 is an age when people\u2019s tastes and sense of identity can rapidly change and clothes often begin to matter more than they did before.", "YTA I have been in this situation, and I know how incredibly frustrating it is, but this doesn\u2019t teach the child anything except to not contradict authority figures. A logical consequence would be that they need to have outfits selected and laid out the night before. This would help teach them healthy habits that they can use as adults. Taking clothes away makes you feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something, but it doesn\u2019t really help teach the child how to pick out their own clothes, make sure outfits are clean and prepared, or any other skills.", "YTA You need to pick your battles, A 12 year old is old enough to be able to dress themselves. Who cares what they wear really as long as it\u2019s clean and covers them. It\u2019s important for your children to have some autonomy in their life, even at 12. Something small like letting them decide what to wear goes along way and maintaining their sense of self. Now I\u2019m not saying pajamas are appropriate for church, and you can definitely continue to have the conversation about clothes that are appropriate for certain situations. But taking away their ability to pick their clothes every day and have one approved outfit is going to damage their sense of autonomy and make them feel like you\u2019re being very controlling", "YTA\n\nYour kid seems to be in the middle of multiple punishments.\n\nAre any of them working?\n\nYou need better parenting skills OP.

Its normal for kids to push back. Keep a cool head here and ask yourself what you would have wanted from your mother. Did you ask why kiddo she is refusing to go? Would you honor the desire not to continue going? At age 12 maybe she wants control of her own life or parts of it. In my own life I started rebelling at that age too, but it was because of inappropriate behavior of an adult in youth group that made me feel gross and scared. So, why not sit down and ask compassionately, and accept the answers? Maybe negotiate?", "YTA. You sound controlling and honestly expect more boundary pushing. Now is the time for kids to learn how to make choices and navigate life. They need guidance but they need to able to make their own choices, they will never grow if they don\u2019t.", "YTA. Not for making them change, but your response to everything they do that you dislike is to take away a form of entertainment. You're making your kid's life boring af, taking away methods of communication with friends, now you're controlling every single thing they wear and you wonder why your kid's rebelling? \nSounds like you need family counseling, and no, I don't mean find a Christian therapist that preaches absolute obedience to parents and spare the rod type of messages. Your actions will naturally lead your child to hate you. When they choose not to have contact with you when they grow up, don't get angry that you have no control over them.", "YTA. Wow. Your kid clearly doesn't want to go to church anymore, and taking away their clothes won't make them more inclined to go. I'm getting stressed out just reading this post.", "Yes, YTA. I have a 13 year old that I OFTEN have clothing clashes with but come on, what are you winning here? How is this ACTUALLY going to make your kid want to work with you on clothing disagreements?", "You kinda missed the boat already on appropriate punishment. If church is something they enjoy, then if they aren't dressed appropriately, they don't go. \n\nYes, it's annoying that a parent would have to stay home if the kid is too young, but it avoids a lot of drama. \n\nAlthough I really think you have to revist your parenting strategies. When you have already taken so much away that you are grasping around to find another way to punish them, then something has gone drastically wrong with your parenting.\n\nYes YTA if you actually take away all your kids clothes. And that doesn't sound healthy.", "YTA, that seems pretty extreme for a small act of rebellion. \n\nAny chance your child dislikes church and is finding little ways to rebel about it?", "YTA. Even a kid needs some control in their life. My parents pulled similar punishments with me I'm now adult and we have little to no relationship because of how much this fucked me up. I have issues with hoarding and have only been able to get to happy place in my life. I strongly suggest talking more with your son why this happens dealing with punishments that make him understand in relation to what happened that aren't as extreme if you want the kid growing up happy and healthy and in your life.", "Yta.  Consequences should follow the \u2018crime\u2019.  If your 12 yr old didn\u2019t want to get dressed for church, withhold church from them.  They\u2019re old enough to stay home alone", "You're getting into a power struggle, and you will lose. Enforce clothing for church if it's that important, and back way off on the control of other days of the week. If they show up to school in something inappropriate, let the school deal out the consequences.", "YTA. At this rate your kid will grow up wanting nothing to do with church\u2026be grateful if she wants anything to do with you.", "YTA. You say in a comment that some of the clothes no longer fit- so it\u2019s likely that your kid is uncomfortable in what they have and needs new clothes. No one wants to wear clothes that don\u2019t fit, so punishing them for something that is your responsibility (providing clothes that fit) is definitely an AH move.", "YTA. I\u2019m a Christian and there were years as a teen where my parents let me go to church in pajamas, including on Sunday mornings. They pointed out that if Jesus loves us despite our sins he wouldn\u2019t care about how we look or what we wear.\n\nWhy does it matter if they were going to wear pajamas? It literally hurt no one. If you care more about people\u2019s perceptions of your parenting than the comfort of your kids, YTA. \n\nAlso, their clothes don\u2019t fit them correctly! They probably just wanted to be comfortable in their own outfit.", "YTA for that and for not realizing your child DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO CHURCH.  I never did, I was forced to go and to get confirmed.  And I've never set foot in church since I left home, and I am an atheist.", "Holy shit dude, YTA. Can you not figure out why your kid is rebelling against your strict rules? Maybe ask yourself why your kid didn\u2019t get dressed properly.", "YTA. My mom acted like you and I am very low contact with her as an adult because of it :)", "YTA. I never understood this desire to police what people wear. \n\nHell, I am 44 years old and when I am not at work, I wear pajama pants and t shirts. EVERYWHERE.\n\nThey aren't crazy designed ones, simply because I don't like writing and pictures on my clothing. But, they are plain Blue, gray, or black pajama pants and a matching t shirt. I also wear flip-flops year round when not a work. \n\nMost days I work 12-16 hour days in a restaurant in no slip shoes, jeans, t shirt, so when  I off work I want to be as comfortable as possible. \n\nMy 8 year old wears sweatpants everyday.

Behavior is communication. What is your child trying to tell you?  In a non-confrontational way, ask her what is bothering her about going.", "Yta- the kid very obviously doesn\u2019t want to go to your church.", "I never understood why people restrict team sports as a punishment. You are punishing the kid from exercising in a healthy manner and punishing an entire team of kids who are at a critical age of learning to work together. \n\nAs far as punishing for grades. At 12, I hated school. I had a hard time learning and focusing, and I got made fun of a lot. Maybe instead of punishing them on their grades, find the root of the issue and help them. I found out I have ADHD and am dyslexic. If my mom had just helped me get help when I was younger, I might have had so many more opportunities in life. \n\nAs for the church clothes. I wouldn't let my kid wear pajamas to church either, but he can wear whatever else he wants. I had to wear dress up clothes every Sunday as youth, and the first chance I got to never step foot in a church again, I took it. \n\nI don't think your an A, but could maybe use some reconstructing as a parent.", "YTA. I can't even start.\n\nThe appropriate response to \"I won't wear something else\" is \"then we won't go\". Not \"I will control everything you wear\".

GOD does not care what you wear to church!!", "YTA - I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that 12 year old doesn't want to go to church and is using the disrespectful and inappropriate outfit excuse to get out of it. The tantrum that followed was also a tactic because 12 doesn't want to be there. You are always the asshole for forcing religion on people who don't want it.", "YTA. Do you really think god, if they exist, gives a fuck about what clothes they wear? You over reliance on punishments are obviously not working either if you have run out of options.

Rather than setting up a fight by making this verbal, just leave him a note or text him on his way home from school.

I feel like if you had said that the kid couldn\u2019t wear their pajamas to chess club or something, the verdicts would be far more mixed.\n\nI vote NAH as I think not wearing pajamas is a reasonable expectation for out of the house events. As long as you aren\u2019t purposely choosing outfits the kid hates, I don\u2019t think the punishment is as harsh as some people here are making it out to be. 12 year old is not an AH either because they\u2019re 12.\n\nNot letting them go to church probably would have been a better punishment, but I don\u2019t think what you did is awful either.\n\nI do think \u201cundetermined time period\u201d could potentially make this turn into an AH move on your part though. In general punishments should come with a clear path for getting out of them, plus I think too long would be really disproportionate when the initial \u201coffense\u201d was so minor.  I think a couple days to get the point across should be more than enough.\n\nYou should also talk to the kid again and make sure there isn\u2019t something going on at church (I know you insist there isn\u2019t but something could have changed even within a week).

Next time, let them wear the pj's. They will be the one embarrassed for their choices.", "NTA but I think you have better options than taking all the control. Allow them to pick the outfit but you have to approve it for a set period of time. Discuss why something is appropriate in one case but not another. Unfortunately, society is slowly starting to make even pajamas acceptable as attire. I recently talked to someone who was interviewing for a kennel tech for a veterinarian. While clean jeans and a shirt with tennis shoes would have been acceptable for such a job one applicant showed up in a tee with jogging pants and slippers. For obvious reasons they didn\u2019t even get considered for the job.\nFirst impressions are very important and what you wear contributes greatly to that impression. Your punishment was a bit of an AH move but most parents have overreacted a time or two when the kiddo hit that last nerve. Suck it up, apologize for overreacting, and take the time to star explaining why it\u2019s so important. I\u2019m sure you can find some great situational examples on sites like people of Walmart.

Maybe not, but your job isn't to be fair to the team, it's to teach your child that their behavior and actions have consequences and sometumes those consequences don't just affect them. When they realize that being a little shit means their teammates suffer too, maybe they'll think twice next time.\n\nEdit: I also think kids need to learn that not everything they want to wear is appropriate for every setting. And it doesn't sound like you were asking for much. I wouldn't expand this \"one outfit we pick\" punishment out for a long time, but a week? Where you do your best to pick something that fits your kid's style and where they'll be (ie: not dressing them in their Easter best all week just because you can), I think that's fine.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As we were leaving the house my 12 year old was wearing pajamas and we asked them to change into something more appropriate.  Of which they responded with \"I have nothing to wear\" and outright \"no\".  We ended up helping them find more appropriate clothing with a lot of yelling and stress for both parents and all kids.  The kid had just done laundry... They literally had nothing dirty.\n\nI'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.  They already have lost phone (tied to grades), tv (it's a rarity in general).  Don't want to cut out extracurricular (team sports) due to the commitment to the team.  Not sure what is appropriate consequences would be.\n\nOn the drive to church, tried talking about it... Just wanted a simple I should have just changed when asked... But they refused to talk.  In frustration, I told them that I'm taking away all clothes except one parent approved outfit every day.\n\nAm I the asshat for taking away clothing for an undetermined time period for something this silly.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I used to do positive discipline and the natural consequence here would have been going to church in Pj's.

It was like a short reading then hang out in a room playing games and getting good snacks. Coloring when I was younger. Those kind of church things are a small bit of religion and a whole bunch of babysitting. They really are to give parents a break and kids a safe place to hang out. Or the ones I went to were. I think people see the loud extremes and forget there are good, decent religious people as well as the awful ones. \n\nHaving said that, from the comments it seems like the kid might be growing out of their clothes and perhaps embarrassed by how poorly they fit so that's a factor in their actions.\n\nYWBTA if you did enforce the clothing rule though.", "INFO: do you like your kid?", "Although I agree that the kid should have dressed properly to go out, YTA because you seem to control your child's life in infinite detail.", "YTA \n\nThe issue doesn\u2019t seem that serious to warrant a punishment and the church itself is just a building and a social club.

My guess is they are figuring out religion is nonsense and are tired of being forced to go (on a Wednesday?) How often a week are they forced to go to church? The clothes thing was probably a weak attempt to take a stand and get out of it. It sounds like the clothes thing isn't the issue but the rebellion to your religious indoctrination of said child by the child is pissing you off. I could be wrong but that's what it sounds like to me. Is your child allowed to think for themselves and have some free choice or are you one of the parents who treats them like property until they are 18? Is the punishment really for the pajamas or for saying no to going to church?

What motivation do they have to actually listen to anything an overly strict parent says?", "YTA. Your kid is just trying have some control over something in their own life. They want a choice over something. It could be because you have a lot of rules and standards that you uphold them to with punishments. It could also just be that they are a growing teen who is exploring their own self expression and wanting to feel more independent. Either way it\u2019s healthy to let them have some kind of autonomy in their life. Even if it\u2019s about wearing pyjamas to church. \n\nI don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve gone to the extremes of wearing pyjamas if they didn\u2019t already feel like their life is being controlled. They\u2019re trying to push boundaries by doing it. I personally wouldn\u2019t use punishment as a way to teach them.\n\nInstead I would say that pyjamas are not appropriate to wear in public and that I don\u2019t care what they wear in public (including church) as long as it is modest (covers all the important bits) and is of clothes from their wardrobe that would usually be worn outdoors. They may come up with some hideous outfit that looks ridiculous, but as long as it\u2019s not revealing, undies are on the inside, and it\u2019s clothing one would usually wear in public (jeans, T-shirts etc), then that would be fine. \n\nYou might want to consider relaxing some of your rules that you have with your kids and letting them feel like they have a say in how they live. It will be good for their personal development and also for your relationship. You can still have standards and boundaries but punishments shouldn\u2019t be necessary.

This is teenage rebellion, you\u2019re punishing them for that so hopefully they won\u2019t be bullied or whatever for wearing pajamas.\n\n I think instead of deciding clothes for them though, you should figure out why they want to be in there pajamas. Did they not want to go to church? Or do they just like the pajama textures more? You WBTA for choosing their clothes for longer than a week or whatever. That\u2019s just controlling behavior. The punishment doesn\u2019t fit the \u201ccrime\u201d then.\n\nAlso, I had a friend in college who were pajamas EVERYWHERE. His favorite being a tuxedo suit onesie. No one cared. Maybe buy fancier pajamas if that\u2019s your kids outfit of choice.", "YTA.

My mom said \"not under my roof\" when I came out as atheist at 16. For the next two years I still went to church in not pajamas. My mom still didn't get her way - 15 years later I'm still firmly atheist.\n\nOP, YTA simply because you're forcing your kid to do something they obviously don't want to do. Ask what they're thinking/feeling in a safe and comfortable environment. Don't dismiss or argue with what they say. Actually listen.\n\nMight I suggest- if your kid says they don't believe in god, don't force them to go to church. Offer them other activities, such as volunteering.

Is it because they don\u2019t like their clothing or they didn\u2019t want to go maybe and do they have any choice in these matters?

One of the families kid's grew out a massive afro, white kid just really curly thick hair. And his mom said once, if that is the \"worst\" thing my kid is doing, I'm not worried about him at all.\n\nOP, I say the same to you. If jammies to church is the \"worst\" thing your kid is doing, you need to move on. \n\nNow, I understand grades are slipping and there seem to be other issues, but increasingly restrictive punishments are just plain NOT gonna achieve your actual goal.

I use my clothing to express myself and if my parent were to try and do something like this I would just find ways to work around it.

If not, that's a double asshole move, and you're holding your child up to an unfair standard and then punishing them for something out of their control\n\nAlso, that's just a recipe for giving her a grade related complex and burnout later in life. It's far better to focus on rewarding whether or not she tried her best (regardless of what her 'best' grade may be), and if she improved on whatever she got last time. That encourages her to reflect on her own learning, assess herself to decide whether during her last assignment that she did try her best or not. Involving her in that self assessment of if she did her best and improved since her last assignment/exam (the assessment beinf what decides if she has earned a reward or not) will end up encouraging her to become a far more active participant in her own learning(which will help her overall study skills and will be so useful in higher learning when studying is more self directed/motivated). Rather than rewards being based on \"this letter grade = bad, this letter grade = good\", focusing on self assessing progression and improvement is mentally healthier and more useful long term in life", "In isolation throwing a tantrum over not being allowed to wear pajamas to church would be something for a 12 year old to apologize for.\n\nIn context I can\u2019t blame the 12 y/o at all as the parents seem overbearing and extra punitive about everything so acting out is expected (and justified).

It's kinda expected that kids will grow quickly at the most random and inconvenient times.
