As we were leaving the house my 12 year old was wearing pajamas and we asked them to change into something more appropriate.  Of which they responded with \"I have nothing to wear\" and outright \"no\".  We ended up helping them find more appropriate clothing with a lot of yelling and stress for both parents and all kids.  The kid had just done laundry... They literally had nothing dirty.\n\nI'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.  They already have lost phone (tied to grades), tv (it's a rarity in general).  Don't want to cut out extracurricular (team sports) due to the commitment to the team.  Not sure what is appropriate consequences would be.\n\nOn the drive to church, tried talking about it... Just wanted a simple I should have just changed when asked... But they refused to talk.  In frustration, I told them that I'm taking away all clothes except one parent approved outfit every day.\n\nAm I the asshat for taking away clothing for an undetermined time period for something this silly.", "created_utc": 1680126636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1261uwh/aita_for_taking_away_clothing_choice/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was viciously bullied at church and would get out of going by being sick when I was twelve.", "YTA. Mate, chill out. The more extreme you get, the more your kid will act out.", "Based on the punishments, YTA, and I would be willing to bet I know why they're acting out. \n\nThat being said- you can't think of one reason WHY they didn't want to get dressed? Do they not want to go to church? 12 is certainly an age when kids can decide what they do and don't want to do.", "Yta\n\nYou seem pushy af and if he is rebelling already good luck having any control over him at 16. The problem isn't that you need to punish him more it's that you need to see that your parenting strategy is really poor.\n\nDid you consider that he maybe didn't want to go to church? Although I doubt this is an option for the kid.", "YTA. When you literally run out of things to take away from your child it might be time to reflect on how effective your approach is.\n\nFrom your post, it does seem you are more occupied with the audacity of your kid telling you \"no\" than you are with understanding what's going on with the kid not wanting to get dressed. I can understand why they don't want to talk about it with you if, for you, the main goal of such a coversation is \"getting a simple I should have just changed when asked\". \n\nIt's nice to give kids structure and dicipline, but they also need love, understanding, and above all, respect. Your post reads like the things are contingent on their obedience to you. I would not be surprised if this makes it very hard for them to respect you back.\n\nThat you consider holding their team sport activity hostage to force them into complacency and the fact that respect for the team, not your kids developmental needs, is what swung it for you worries me greatly.", "YTA. You really can't figure out why your kid is rebelling against your super strict rules? Did they even want to go to church? Have they ever gotten to choose their own look for clothes? Or if they want to go to church activities?", "INFO:  What do you deem appropriate for them to wear to church and why did they resist wearing it so much?", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s just church. Make sure they aren\u2019t in anything offensive and clothing\u2019s clean - that\u2019s all that matter. \n\nYour kid is likely rebelling because not everything needs a strict punishment.", "Yta- taking way clothing choice is you saying you are the only one right here. I do not agree with the child\u2019s attitude but they are that a child. If this is a forced thing for the kids this is their way of rebelling. Let them have their choices but explain to them it has to be appropriate. Also LISTEN to your kids if they say they do not want to go every Wednesday.", ">I'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.\n\nMaybe try listening to your child as to why they don't want to go to church? Or don't, bur don't be surprised when kiddo leaves at 18 because you were too busy finding ways to stroke your ego. \n\nYTA", "YTA - my parents were like this and I am now no contact with one and low contact with the other. There are way worse things than wearing pajama bottoms.", "YTA. There is so much that's wrong here.", "YTA\n\nParent of a 14yo here. My child wears the absolute WORST clothes to school. Hoodies three sizes too big, pajama pants so long they puddle at their feet, basket ball shorts over sweat pants, sweaters with suspenders, socks with sandals - I don't know dude. \n\nIts an everyday struggle for me and my 'well adjusted' sensitivities, but we don't shame our kid about their choices and as long as its respectful of the environment, not vulgar or graphic, and the private bits are covered we let that shit go man. Our kid has juvenile arthritis and sometimes their clothing choices are made as a result of that as well. Maybe your child was having a bloated day and didn't want the pressure of a regular pants waistband? \n\nUltimately it likely boils down to you being worried how you (or your parenting) will be judged based on what they are wearing and thats a very unimportant thing when stacked up against teaching your child to be their most authentic self. \n\nPrehaps if you had approached the situation with a little less 'do as I say' and a little more 'I support your judgment', your kid wouldn't have shut down and taken conversation with you as a threat. \n\nPersonally I would have had an out of body experience if my child tried to attend church in pajamas but I was raised in a toxic af environment and am actively unlearning those behaviors, also we are Buddhist.", "YTA for two major reasons. \n\n1. You're policing what your kid wears to the point of punishing them with taking away the phone and tv and also all their clothes except the singular outfit you approve. You are taking away their creativity in their outfits and literally showing them that other people get to decide what they can or cannot wear. If any of your children are girls, you might be setting them up to be open to being criticized by people for her future outfit choices and feeling like she has no right to say no. Unless they want to wear a bikini to church, who cares if they wear pajamas?\n\n2. As someone who grew up in an evangelical community (your choice as a girl if you didn't want to go to church on Sunday was to go help in the church's daycare during service, but not going to either was not an option) and also have a theology degree, you're being prideful. You care what other people think about how your kids dress. You want to present well to others, not to God. God is with you 24/7 365 days a year. God sees you naked in the shower, when you're having sex, when you're in your PJs eating popcorn and fried chicken, when you look like shit from illness, when you gave birth to your kids etc. God does not care what you wear to worship Him. YOU care. You care what others think of you and how you think your kids' outfits reflect on you. If you take a step back, ask yourself what your outfits tell you about your faith. Do you think having your girls in floral dresses and your boys in polos and slacks (or a small cutesy tie, shirt and slacks) is going to bring them closer in their relationship with God? Or do you think the fact you traumatize them every Sunday is going to harm their desire to go to church? I have a hunch they dread the fight on Sundays and the fact they have to wear something they don't have to wear 6 other days of the week. I can assure you that God does not care what you or your kids wear to church. There are churches around the world where people come in their every day clothes to church which could include greasy clothes, stained clothes, suits, fast food restaurant uniforms, etc. Remember the TRUE purpose of church - it ain't a fashion show or a red carpet for best dressed.", "It sounds like a lot of work is going into punishing your kid. Who cares what they are wearing, really? This type of pushback is common for that age and you really have to choose your battles. Disrespectful behavior is out of line, but IMO letting them experience the natural consequences of wearing jammies to church is a better use of your time. NAH because it sounds like typical tween shit. But YWBTA to yourself if you spend a lot of time focused on punishment. Honestly, they grow out of it.", "YTA You should punish him by making him miss out on Wednesday indoctrination.", "YTA punishment is extreme. Just let them wear what they want", "YTA. An appropriate consequence for your kid delaying you by not being able to pick out a church outfit would be to require them to start choosing and laying out their clothes the night before. \n\nThis is also worth talking with your kid about to figure out what was going on. Were they just trying to get out of church? Are they growing and their clothes don\u2019t fit well? Do they hate all their formal clothes? 12 is an age when people\u2019s tastes and sense of identity can rapidly change and clothes often begin to matter more than they did before.", "YTA I have been in this situation, and I know how incredibly frustrating it is, but this doesn\u2019t teach the child anything except to not contradict authority figures. A logical consequence would be that they need to have outfits selected and laid out the night before. This would help teach them healthy habits that they can use as adults. Taking clothes away makes you feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something, but it doesn\u2019t really help teach the child how to pick out their own clothes, make sure outfits are clean and prepared, or any other skills.", "YTA You need to pick your battles, A 12 year old is old enough to be able to dress themselves. Who cares what they wear really as long as it\u2019s clean and covers them. It\u2019s important for your children to have some autonomy in their life, even at 12. Something small like letting them decide what to wear goes along way and maintaining their sense of self. Now I\u2019m not saying pajamas are appropriate for church, and you can definitely continue to have the conversation about clothes that are appropriate for certain situations. But taking away their ability to pick their clothes every day and have one approved outfit is going to damage their sense of autonomy and make them feel like you\u2019re being very controlling", "YTA\n\nYour kid seems to be in the middle of multiple punishments.\n\nAre any of them working?\n\nYou need better parenting skills OP.

Its normal for kids to push back. Keep a cool head here and ask yourself what you would have wanted from your mother. Did you ask why kiddo she is refusing to go? Would you honor the desire not to continue going? At age 12 maybe she wants control of her own life or parts of it. In my own life I started rebelling at that age too, but it was because of inappropriate behavior of an adult in youth group that made me feel gross and scared. So, why not sit down and ask compassionately, and accept the answers? Maybe negotiate?", "YTA. You sound controlling and honestly expect more boundary pushing. Now is the time for kids to learn how to make choices and navigate life. They need guidance but they need to able to make their own choices, they will never grow if they don\u2019t.", "YTA. Not for making them change, but your response to everything they do that you dislike is to take away a form of entertainment. You're making your kid's life boring af, taking away methods of communication with friends, now you're controlling every single thing they wear and you wonder why your kid's rebelling? \nSounds like you need family counseling, and no, I don't mean find a Christian therapist that preaches absolute obedience to parents and spare the rod type of messages. Your actions will naturally lead your child to hate you. When they choose not to have contact with you when they grow up, don't get angry that you have no control over them.", "YTA. Wow. Your kid clearly doesn't want to go to church anymore, and taking away their clothes won't make them more inclined to go. I'm getting stressed out just reading this post.", "Yes, YTA. I have a 13 year old that I OFTEN have clothing clashes with but come on, what are you winning here? How is this ACTUALLY going to make your kid want to work with you on clothing disagreements?", "You kinda missed the boat already on appropriate punishment. If church is something they enjoy, then if they aren't dressed appropriately, they don't go. \n\nYes, it's annoying that a parent would have to stay home if the kid is too young, but it avoids a lot of drama. \n\nAlthough I really think you have to revist your parenting strategies. When you have already taken so much away that you are grasping around to find another way to punish them, then something has gone drastically wrong with your parenting.\n\nYes YTA if you actually take away all your kids clothes. And that doesn't sound healthy.", "YTA, that seems pretty extreme for a small act of rebellion. \n\nAny chance your child dislikes church and is finding little ways to rebel about it?", "YTA. Even a kid needs some control in their life. My parents pulled similar punishments with me I'm now adult and we have little to no relationship because of how much this fucked me up. I have issues with hoarding and have only been able to get to happy place in my life. I strongly suggest talking more with your son why this happens dealing with punishments that make him understand in relation to what happened that aren't as extreme if you want the kid growing up happy and healthy and in your life.", "Yta.  Consequences should follow the \u2018crime\u2019.  If your 12 yr old didn\u2019t want to get dressed for church, withhold church from them.  They\u2019re old enough to stay home alone", "You're getting into a power struggle, and you will lose. Enforce clothing for church if it's that important, and back way off on the control of other days of the week. If they show up to school in something inappropriate, let the school deal out the consequences.", "YTA. At this rate your kid will grow up wanting nothing to do with church\u2026be grateful if she wants anything to do with you.", "YTA. You say in a comment that some of the clothes no longer fit- so it\u2019s likely that your kid is uncomfortable in what they have and needs new clothes. No one wants to wear clothes that don\u2019t fit, so punishing them for something that is your responsibility (providing clothes that fit) is definitely an AH move.", "YTA. I\u2019m a Christian and there were years as a teen where my parents let me go to church in pajamas, including on Sunday mornings. They pointed out that if Jesus loves us despite our sins he wouldn\u2019t care about how we look or what we wear.\n\nWhy does it matter if they were going to wear pajamas? It literally hurt no one. If you care more about people\u2019s perceptions of your parenting than the comfort of your kids, YTA. \n\nAlso, their clothes don\u2019t fit them correctly! They probably just wanted to be comfortable in their own outfit.", "YTA for that and for not realizing your child DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO CHURCH.  I never did, I was forced to go and to get confirmed.  And I've never set foot in church since I left home, and I am an atheist.", "Holy shit dude, YTA. Can you not figure out why your kid is rebelling against your strict rules? Maybe ask yourself why your kid didn\u2019t get dressed properly.", "YTA. My mom acted like you and I am very low contact with her as an adult because of it :)", "YTA. I never understood this desire to police what people wear. \n\nHell, I am 44 years old and when I am not at work, I wear pajama pants and t shirts. EVERYWHERE.\n\nThey aren't crazy designed ones, simply because I don't like writing and pictures on my clothing. But, they are plain Blue, gray, or black pajama pants and a matching t shirt. I also wear flip-flops year round when not a work. \n\nMost days I work 12-16 hour days in a restaurant in no slip shoes, jeans, t shirt, so when  I off work I want to be as comfortable as possible. \n\nMy 8 year old wears sweatpants everyday.

Behavior is communication. What is your child trying to tell you?  In a non-confrontational way, ask her what is bothering her about going.", "Yta- the kid very obviously doesn\u2019t want to go to your church.", "I never understood why people restrict team sports as a punishment. You are punishing the kid from exercising in a healthy manner and punishing an entire team of kids who are at a critical age of learning to work together. \n\nAs far as punishing for grades. At 12, I hated school. I had a hard time learning and focusing, and I got made fun of a lot. Maybe instead of punishing them on their grades, find the root of the issue and help them. I found out I have ADHD and am dyslexic. If my mom had just helped me get help when I was younger, I might have had so many more opportunities in life. \n\nAs for the church clothes. I wouldn't let my kid wear pajamas to church either, but he can wear whatever else he wants. I had to wear dress up clothes every Sunday as youth, and the first chance I got to never step foot in a church again, I took it. \n\nI don't think your an A, but could maybe use some reconstructing as a parent.", "YTA. I can't even start.\n\nThe appropriate response to \"I won't wear something else\" is \"then we won't go\". Not \"I will control everything you wear\".

GOD does not care what you wear to church!!", "YTA - I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that 12 year old doesn't want to go to church and is using the disrespectful and inappropriate outfit excuse to get out of it. The tantrum that followed was also a tactic because 12 doesn't want to be there. You are always the asshole for forcing religion on people who don't want it.", "YTA. Do you really think god, if they exist, gives a fuck about what clothes they wear? You over reliance on punishments are obviously not working either if you have run out of options.

Rather than setting up a fight by making this verbal, just leave him a note or text him on his way home from school.

I feel like if you had said that the kid couldn\u2019t wear their pajamas to chess club or something, the verdicts would be far more mixed.\n\nI vote NAH as I think not wearing pajamas is a reasonable expectation for out of the house events. As long as you aren\u2019t purposely choosing outfits the kid hates, I don\u2019t think the punishment is as harsh as some people here are making it out to be. 12 year old is not an AH either because they\u2019re 12.\n\nNot letting them go to church probably would have been a better punishment, but I don\u2019t think what you did is awful either.\n\nI do think \u201cundetermined time period\u201d could potentially make this turn into an AH move on your part though. In general punishments should come with a clear path for getting out of them, plus I think too long would be really disproportionate when the initial \u201coffense\u201d was so minor.  I think a couple days to get the point across should be more than enough.\n\nYou should also talk to the kid again and make sure there isn\u2019t something going on at church (I know you insist there isn\u2019t but something could have changed even within a week).

Next time, let them wear the pj's. They will be the one embarrassed for their choices.", "NTA but I think you have better options than taking all the control. Allow them to pick the outfit but you have to approve it for a set period of time. Discuss why something is appropriate in one case but not another. Unfortunately, society is slowly starting to make even pajamas acceptable as attire. I recently talked to someone who was interviewing for a kennel tech for a veterinarian. While clean jeans and a shirt with tennis shoes would have been acceptable for such a job one applicant showed up in a tee with jogging pants and slippers. For obvious reasons they didn\u2019t even get considered for the job.\nFirst impressions are very important and what you wear contributes greatly to that impression. Your punishment was a bit of an AH move but most parents have overreacted a time or two when the kiddo hit that last nerve. Suck it up, apologize for overreacting, and take the time to star explaining why it\u2019s so important. I\u2019m sure you can find some great situational examples on sites like people of Walmart.

Maybe not, but your job isn't to be fair to the team, it's to teach your child that their behavior and actions have consequences and sometumes those consequences don't just affect them. When they realize that being a little shit means their teammates suffer too, maybe they'll think twice next time.\n\nEdit: I also think kids need to learn that not everything they want to wear is appropriate for every setting. And it doesn't sound like you were asking for much. I wouldn't expand this \"one outfit we pick\" punishment out for a long time, but a week? Where you do your best to pick something that fits your kid's style and where they'll be (ie: not dressing them in their Easter best all week just because you can), I think that's fine.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As we were leaving the house my 12 year old was wearing pajamas and we asked them to change into something more appropriate.  Of which they responded with \"I have nothing to wear\" and outright \"no\".  We ended up helping them find more appropriate clothing with a lot of yelling and stress for both parents and all kids.  The kid had just done laundry... They literally had nothing dirty.\n\nI'm trying to figure out appropriate consequences now.  They already have lost phone (tied to grades), tv (it's a rarity in general).  Don't want to cut out extracurricular (team sports) due to the commitment to the team.  Not sure what is appropriate consequences would be.\n\nOn the drive to church, tried talking about it... Just wanted a simple I should have just changed when asked... But they refused to talk.  In frustration, I told them that I'm taking away all clothes except one parent approved outfit every day.\n\nAm I the asshat for taking away clothing for an undetermined time period for something this silly.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I used to do positive discipline and the natural consequence here would have been going to church in Pj's.

It was like a short reading then hang out in a room playing games and getting good snacks. Coloring when I was younger. Those kind of church things are a small bit of religion and a whole bunch of babysitting. They really are to give parents a break and kids a safe place to hang out. Or the ones I went to were. I think people see the loud extremes and forget there are good, decent religious people as well as the awful ones. \n\nHaving said that, from the comments it seems like the kid might be growing out of their clothes and perhaps embarrassed by how poorly they fit so that's a factor in their actions.\n\nYWBTA if you did enforce the clothing rule though.", "INFO: do you like your kid?", "Although I agree that the kid should have dressed properly to go out, YTA because you seem to control your child's life in infinite detail.", "YTA \n\nThe issue doesn\u2019t seem that serious to warrant a punishment and the church itself is just a building and a social club.

My guess is they are figuring out religion is nonsense and are tired of being forced to go (on a Wednesday?) How often a week are they forced to go to church? The clothes thing was probably a weak attempt to take a stand and get out of it. It sounds like the clothes thing isn't the issue but the rebellion to your religious indoctrination of said child by the child is pissing you off. I could be wrong but that's what it sounds like to me. Is your child allowed to think for themselves and have some free choice or are you one of the parents who treats them like property until they are 18? Is the punishment really for the pajamas or for saying no to going to church?

What motivation do they have to actually listen to anything an overly strict parent says?", "YTA. Your kid is just trying have some control over something in their own life. They want a choice over something. It could be because you have a lot of rules and standards that you uphold them to with punishments. It could also just be that they are a growing teen who is exploring their own self expression and wanting to feel more independent. Either way it\u2019s healthy to let them have some kind of autonomy in their life. Even if it\u2019s about wearing pyjamas to church. \n\nI don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve gone to the extremes of wearing pyjamas if they didn\u2019t already feel like their life is being controlled. They\u2019re trying to push boundaries by doing it. I personally wouldn\u2019t use punishment as a way to teach them.\n\nInstead I would say that pyjamas are not appropriate to wear in public and that I don\u2019t care what they wear in public (including church) as long as it is modest (covers all the important bits) and is of clothes from their wardrobe that would usually be worn outdoors. They may come up with some hideous outfit that looks ridiculous, but as long as it\u2019s not revealing, undies are on the inside, and it\u2019s clothing one would usually wear in public (jeans, T-shirts etc), then that would be fine. \n\nYou might want to consider relaxing some of your rules that you have with your kids and letting them feel like they have a say in how they live. It will be good for their personal development and also for your relationship. You can still have standards and boundaries but punishments shouldn\u2019t be necessary.

She's already given up her club volleyball team because as much as she enjoyed playing, she decided that two nights a week where she couldn't even start on any homework until after 8 was too much for her.

Even when she's not napping, she usually needs a good hour to decompress before she can do anything. If I tried to drag her to church at 6 every Wednesday, I guarantee we'd have problems.\n\nNow, all kids are different and all schools are different and all schedules are different, so YMMV on any of those specifics, but it's at least a consideration...we put our kids under a lot of stress nowadays and sometimes we miss that by comparing it to the things we did when we were their age, but shit's different now.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I'm personally mortified by some of the stuff my kid wears to school, but apparently that's cool now?

How is that you realized last minute they were not ready? And if you didn't realize last minute, then why are you yelling?\n\nWhen they tell you they don't have things that match, do you ask them what do they mean or do you decide they are being immature/childish so you don't have to listen to them? Because If they really want to go as you said and they are telling you they don't have clothes, maybe they are telling the truth? Or maybe they don't want to go but can't be honest with you because you will start yelling?\n\nFunny enough you found one of them, at least, didn't have clothes that fit. So how is that you don't know your children need clothes? Are you ignoring them when they talk dismissing the \"I don't have anything to wear\" saying they just like to complain? And if she grew up so much, how don't you just know? How??? Like it is common sense.\n\nThen since they don't take seriously enough your tirade you decide to go for the kill, taking away the right to chose what to wear. Arriving to that conclusion after this silly incident tells me that you are probably overreacting on other situations as well.\n\nAlso, now days everyone has phones, and I can understand not wanting to give them phones for safety or such, but punishing them based on arbitrary results? You say it is a reward, but it is not, it is a punishment for failing. A reward could be more like earning so many hour for so much effort, sort of like salary? The fact is, no one is truly guaranteed any particular grade in school. You should never punish a child based on their grades, you are creating all sort of trauma there. You have to look at it as a matter of effort. Are they working a lot trying to get good grades in math? Even If they don't get the b, if they pass and put a lot of effort, why are you punishing them? But of course, that would require to pay attention to the process and help them, instead of just checking results. And since you can't tell without major drama that a child that grows so much will likely need new clothes, I am inclined to believe you are probably not putting the effort either in that area.\n\nRespect is earned. Authority is not being able to yell more and louder. Authority, at least moral authority it is not the same as having power. You may have power over your children, you can punish them and tell them they can not wear anything but what you say. But you are losing little by little any lvl of respect and moral authority. You lose it and start yelling over stupid things. You don't properly apologize. You don't know they need things as basic as clothes. You make up unreasonable punishments to force them to do what you want. You don't take the time to teach, you just punish. \n\nYou had several teachable moments and you blew them all. Apologize for yelling and for not noticing they needed clothes. Teach them to communicate, to tell you better what they need. Apologize for not asking why did they mean. You can still change.

You\u2019re not talking TO them you\u2019re talking AT them. That doesn\u2019t help anybody.\n\nYour child is a human being and you are not showing them any respect. So why should they show you respect? CHECK IN WITH YOUR KID. There is clearly something going on under the surface and if you just keep punishing them for everything without trying to figure out what\u2019s actually causing all of it, you\u2019re going to lose your kid the second they turn 18.\n\nYTA.", "i don't disagree but i worry about letting the op know that.", "Get up, make your bed, and get dressed. Even if you aren't going anywhere, it has a positive effect psychologically. Starts the day off on a good note. I have a far better and more productive day if I get dressed before breakfast.", "Note from the husband of a therapist who eventually just stopped working with kids because of their shitty parents: in case you do decide to do this, OP, therapy, or at least good therapy, for either you or your daughter, is not there to reinforce your actions or \"fix\" your daughter by making her abide you.Therapy without self reflection and willingness to change is a waste of everyone's time and you'd be better off just coming to reddit and getting raked for your rash parenting decisions, because at least that would be cheaper.", "Trust me no matter what people always get worse", "I mean listen if church was your thing I would say a parent would be an AH for not letting you go. It's just that religion/church is a pretty big thing in someone's life and if the kid isn't into it I think it's just bad to force them.\n\nBut I do agree that asking a question about that here is going to get you biased responses.", ">It's pure growth spurt.  4\" in height in 8 months..\n\nChecks out for a 12 year old. Maybe pay more attention to their clothing and you would know this before you make your problem their fault. It's not hard to check in monthly and say \"hey, drop all your too small clothes into a bag we can donate and  let me know if you need a shopping trip\". I do this every few months with my teenager.", "lOl don't say words like 'hormones' to her... it's not in her fairy tale book -you know the one with the naked people, the apple and the talking snake- I'm not even sure if she understands the word...let alone even remotely grasping how they work...", "What\u2019s the Bible Belt? It\u2019s a Genuine question. Lol", "Or maybe just exaggerating, the way children do?  Just like a kid opening the refrigerator and claiming \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to eat!\u201d  Usually there\u2019s something in there, they just mean there\u2019s nothing they actually want to eat.  It sounds a lot more like the kid was complaining in an exaggerated way than deliberately lying.", "In the case of not letting a 12 year old dictate to his parents what he will and will not be doing, making things difficult and acting like a spoiled brat when not getting his way and without giving any sort of reason as to why he doesn't want to go, and lying to get out of it, no there really is not. Religion hasn't blinded me at all. I don't force my kids to go to Mass with me or pray. Because I exposed them to all the different religions and philosophies I could and let them make their own decisions regarding it as long as their spiritual needs are being met. They come when they want of their own free will. Tantrums and outright defiance without a valid reason though? Yeah, daddy don't play that.", "No, that is, for lack of literally any other term, your opinion. Spirituality is a main building block of the psyche, and it's important for a child to be given tools to nourish that, whether it comes from religion, philosophy, balance with nature, or other paths. Funny how you ignore every other part of my message. And as far as the balanced diet? Um, yeah. It's quite literally the job of parents to make sure their child is healthy. If you're saying otherwise, well there really is no further debate required here because no way could I ever hope to change such an asinine point of view", "If you can't see why a teenage girl might be embarrassed to admit that her clothes don't fit, then I can't help you.", "It\u2019s additional. The Bible Belt would never let you go a whole 7 days away from the church, too much time for sinning. Also, Wednesdays are usually when bell ringers practice.", "My experience is that it is usually more like a bible study/dinner kind of thing rather than full-on worship and the number of people who go is much smaller.", "Generally it's the American Southeast, Virginia down to the Florida border, over to Tennessee, Kentucky, the Carolinas, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, maybe some others, can't remember the full list off the top of my head", "A group of states in the south eastern part of the US where God, the Bible, and church are big deals. There's church days every Wednesday and Sunday, fpr every major religious Christian holiday, VBS during the summer, etc. Religion is so big down here that in some states there used to be (maybe still are) restrictions on things like alcohol sales on Sundays.", "I'm not sure about our current church as I was out of youth when we transferred to it, but I know at my childhood church there was a bit of music, a short lesson typically along the lines of thinking responsibly instead of just charging into something, and some sort of game or bonding activity. Current church's kids had a Gaga ball tournament today and the kindergarten group did playdough and a few musical games the lessons right now was about Palm Sunday.\n\nTldr: not every place is fire and brimstone", "It is for the child to decide how they approach their spirituality, not the parents.", "Too much time in between paying them. Church is looking to get paid!!!!", "hell yeah bell ringers represent!! (we practice sunday mornings though)", "So more of a private/family worship kind of thing instead of the whole congregation?", "Dry counties suck", "Funny how most people on here day that a child shouldn't be allowed to join a religion until they're 18 because anything before that is indoctrination and they're too young, yet now on the flip side, suddenly the child is old enough and wise enough to make final decisions regarding it. Interesting. But i digress; no, it's really not up to them.  As with the other options I listed, sometimes parents have to make choices for the child for their future, whether the child in their apparent infinite wisdom and life experience wants it or not. Same as when they don't want to eat their greens, or want to go to a school based on their friends vs actual educational opportunities, or when they want to eat all the Halloween candy in one night. It's the job of parents to make sure they're on the best path they can be, and it's on the parents to discipline a child that's acting out and lying and sulking when he doesn't get his way and has to attend a perfectly common societal function that is not harming him", "It\u2019s actually a bit more like school. It\u2019s sort of the Sunday-overflow, the time to do stuff you don\u2019t have time for on Sunday. There\u2019s usually a big meal, and you come in and grab food when it fits your schedule. There are practices, rehearsals, meetings, small groups, youth-worship, that sort of thing. Worth noting that I\u2019ve never seen a small church have this. It takes a considerable amount of resources.", "I remember the first time my now husband came to visit me when we were dating. He flew down to SC where I lived at the time during the weekend and went to a store while I hung out in the hotel we'd gotten. He came back and was so surprised that he couldn't buy any alcohol at all and didn't know why. I had to explain Blue Laws to him because he'd never heard of them growing up in the North West and definitely not in Japan where he was living at the time, lol. He said it was one of the dumbest things he'd ever heard of.", "One, she; two, how is church the \u201cbest path to spirituality?\u201d Most religions, especially Christianity, have a history of having a \u201cdo as I say, not as a do\u201d way of being. Not to mention the lack of care/rights/autonomy for women.", "Do you give them the choice whether or not to participate in **your** religion?\n\nMaybe they don't believe in the same things as you, don't wish to go to **your** church.\n\nHave you asked?\n\nYTA x 1,000,000", "Ah. The religious way. Just punish it right out of them! YTA", "I'd love to hear your kid's version of this. Have you ever asked them if they want to go to the church? YTA", "Your house sounds like a nightmare. For the kid. Yta", "YTA\n\nYou don't need to punish kids for any little thing they do. That's hoe you make kids that hate you and rebel EVEN MORE.", "It couldn\u2019t possibly be that their young child is being SA at these youth activities. Seems to be common these days", "Please explain why a C is bad?", "No, I think the point is that if you get to the point where you've run out of consequences, something has gone wrong and you need to re-evaluate your whole approach. \n\nThe \"no pyjamas outside the house\" rule, I can totally understand, but I think the consequences in this case are OTT, and the fact that they've done this because they don't have any reasonable consequences left is a symptom of a larger problem.", "It's the other things and that op has run out of other punishments and now don't even let them dress themselves that's the super strict rules not the out of context completely normal bit about not wearing pajamas to church.", "It's also worth saying that not every point of conflict with your kid should be thought of as a battle. In fact, most conflicts should not be battles, they should be indicators that you're not on the same page and need to figure out why.\n\nYou say you tried to talk to your kid about the altercation, but your goal in talking seemed to be to get an apology, not to figure out why your kid was defying you in the first place. Maybe they didn't want to go to church. Maybe their clothes don't fit. Maybe they're experiencing some discomfort with how their body looks or feels, and wearing pajamas is a way of coping with that.\n\nThe point is, if you actually want to change their behavior, you have to figure out why they're behaving this way in the first place. You can't expect to raise your kid by simply expecting obedience and punishing when you don't get it. You can absolutely expect your kid to speak to you politely and with respect, but there may be any number of situations where they have any number of good reasons for not wanting to do what you tell them.\n\nGo back to your kid and ask *why* they didn't want to change for church. Instead of further limiting their clothing, figure out why they were limiting it in the first place. Ask with the goal of understanding and finding a solution. Your kid needs to dress appropriately, but that shouldn't mean needing to be uncomfortable. If there's something wrong with the clothes they currently own, it may be time for new ones that suit them better, in whatever ways are necessary.\n\nOnce you get to the bottom of the issue and start to move forward, then you can address the disrespect. You can talk about how they should've handled the situation, including reassurances that handling it that way will yield results from you--and follow through to make that the truth.", "That\u2018s interesting. Where I live, wearing PJs in public definitely isn\u2018t a thing and if you did it at school, you\u2018d be sent home to change.", "As someone whose parents attempted (and failed) to raise me in the Catholic tradition, it is insane that people can associate fun and religion. I guess it's another way to suck in the kids.", "Does your church do all of the \"modesty\" purity culture, tight clothes = sex = slut teaching? Because that would be a reason for her to react like that. Youth leaders and girls are MEAN about things like that, and it also makes the boys think they can get away with anything towards the girl. Have you tried actually talking to her instead of leaping straight to punishment?", "Wednesday night church is completely normal where I grew up. If anything, Wednesday night services are more youth oriented than Sunday services.", "I'm from the Midwest, Wednesday was religious ed night. Our didn't schefule sports and other stuff on Wednesdsy night.\n\nThe exception -- state tournament games. The state set the schedule. (And everyone was happy to skip religious ed.)", "Your dad\u2019s IQ is through the roof on that move lol", "Heck, I\u2019m in MN and Wednesday is church night.  Schools don\u2019t have evening activities on Wednesdays", "Midwest also. We went to church twice on Sunday and Wednesday nights.

Everyone is invited, but it's usually centered around the community hall rather than the sanctuary. There's usually a meal served and people socializing. I went with my grandmother a few times and besides a prayer before the meal, there wasn't much religious or Bible talk.", "It can be a service similar to Sundays for people who might have to work Sunday mornings", "My grandmother's small church does this, but asks for $5 per plate. If you can't pay, it's fine though, they won't make you leave."]}
