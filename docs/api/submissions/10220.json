Because of this, on Valentines Day I usually make plans with my friends who are single or don\u2019t have plans with their partners. \n\nThis year in my friend group myself and 5 others are all single and 3 are in relationships. Like every year I decided I wanted to celebrate V-Day with my friends, go out to dinner then the bar after. All my single friends were free and the plans were made. Leading up to V-Day I asked my friends in relationships what they\u2019re doing that day. 2 of them had dinner plans with their partners and the other one (we\u2019ll say Alex) didn\u2019t have plans until later in the night. I thought about asking Alex if they wanted to join us single people for dinner, but decided against it. That way all of us who are single can celebrate our single-ness. \n\nOn V-Day us single people went out for dinner and posted on our stories about celebrating \u201cgalentines day\u201d together. After dinner we went and got ready to go to the bar when in our groupchat, Alex and the two others who are in relationships sent angry messages saying how they felt left out of the group activity. On all of their stories they posted a picture of all of them and their partners out for drinks. Having made these plans after seeing our posts. \n\nWe all saw the texts and got defensive saying to each other how we wanted to celebrate being single but it wasn\u2019t a malicious thing not inviting them. I ended up texting back in the groupchat saying how I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re upset and I didn\u2019t invite them, I just assumed they all had plans with their partners on the day dedicated to celebrating your relationship with your partner. Alex texted back saying I knew they didn\u2019t have plans until later and how all of them feel like they were left out because they\u2019re in relationships. Which I guess isn\u2019t wrong? I again said I\u2019m sorry they were upset but we wanted to celebrate being single together and couldn\u2019t do that with them. \n\nThe conversation eventually ended with them still being upset. It\u2019s been a few days and the groupchat is dead atm and neither group is talking to each other, except for me who is still talking and friendly with both groups. Those in relationships are still talking to me because \u201cI actually apologized\u201d\n\nI feel bad not inviting them, but AITA for not inviting my coupled up friends to what turned into, a singles event on Valentine\u2019s Day because we wanted to celebrate not being in relationships and and they are?", "created_utc": 1676656174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114sxs5/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friends_in_relationships/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We\u2019re allowed to have one on one time with friends or enjoy shared interests that maybe the entire group isn\u2019t on board with. \nFor example, one of my friends is a huge foodie so I know if I want to try good food she\u2019s the one to go with.

You could\u2019ve given them a heads up though but they\u2019re being a tad petty to be upset. Not like you expected to be invited on their couples events.", "NTA. It\u2019s really not that serious. Relationship friends are doing too much", "NTA. Sometimes friend groups do different things. That's OK. It's not like every activity has to cater to all the members. \n\nYou had a clear, bright line reason that you wanted to go out with single friends only, everybody understood that, there was no reason to turn it into a fight.", "NTA.\n\nIt's OK that you apologized, I suppose.  But I think they were way out of line wanting to be invited.  Seriously, unless they would be willing to give up whatever they were doing with their  BFs, why do they need to horn in on the \"single\" fun?", "NTA. Sounds like drama for the sake of it. Not everyone needs to be in every hangout.", "Nta. You don't invite a coupled girl to singles night.\nThey need to get over it.\n\nIf they complain, tell them you don't get invited on valentine's date night, it's literally the same deal.", "NTA\n\nThey need to grow up.", "NTA. Not everyone in a friend group needs to be invited all the time, and especially this time it was to celebrate something that the others are not. Did they want you to stay home and be miserable while they had fun?", "NTA  \n\n\nSo, plainly put, your \"in a relationship\" friends are mad that they didn't get feted twice., once by their partners, and once by single folks?\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. You had a noble intent with your Galentine's Day gathering, and a special meaning behind it that including the friends in couples would detract from.  Yes, including them would be a more \"inclusive\" hangout in the individual instance, but then it undermines the special nature of the occasion.", "NTA.  There isn't anything wrong with hanging out with part of the friend group.  It wasn't done maliciously.  Also, you had plans for the night.  You weren't trying to have someone come for part then leave.  I think they just are young.  I would just say that you do Galentine's as a single party and that you are more than happy to celebrate your love for them at another event AFTER they enjoy the holiday with their significant others.  The rest of you didn't have that so celebrated your love for each other.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to celebrate being single on a day that is celebrating couples. Valentines is notorious for being difficult for people that are single and not being around friends that are in relationships is completely reasonable to learn that blow.  I find you coupled friends reactions really self-centered.  Can they not understand how hard being single on valentines is.  Did they think of inviting you to their dinner with their partner?  Of course not, and you didn't get offended by that.  You understood and instead made other plans to help lessen an emotional blow off feeling alone. \n\nYou also didn't assume, you asked them what their plans were and they all had plans.  Even Alex having plans later in the evening with their partner would have highlighted the fact they have a partner and you guys didn't on valentines day.  \n\nThose 3 honestly sound very immature and self centered and didn't consider how hard the day was for you and the others.  They just got mad and were petty.   I honestly would think twice about continuing those friendships.  And at the least be very clear you didn't \"apologize\" for doing a singles night out when they had plans with their partners.  I would also express that you are hurt they didn't seem to care how hard the day was on you and others and have been trying to share you for doing what you need to lessen the hurt being single on that day often causes.  The only thing I might do in the future is let them know in advance you are doing a singles dinner after asking about their dinner plans with their partners.  This gives you a chance to explain why it needs to just be singles and avoids them feeling hurt when you try to talk about it.  But the fact it has been days since it was explained it sounds like they just don't care.", "NTA, but you and your friends are very young and likely just learning to navigate having serious partners along with still being super attached to a friend group. It makes these situations more tricky than they would be if you were all in high school with super casual partners, or if you were a bit older and settled with a partner into that sort of life. Instead, you've got a group that's basically trying to split the difference. If you want to defuse the situation and let it pass, maybe just apologize and say you're sorry for making them feel left out, since that's genuinely true. Other people have posted that you're NTA for wanting a singles only event, and that's definitely true, but you're also in a friendship-relationship with all these people and compromise might be necessary going forward. Maybe next time say \"Me and the other single girls are meeting on Valentines for shots and messy hookups with strangers. You're welcome to come, but if you and Boyfriend already have plans that's fine too.\" Or something. I don't know how you live.", "NTA but Galentines day is the 13th.\n\nNobody should whine at a subgroup of friends making plans without the whole group, especially when it's about single people getting together an a day couples celebrate.\n\nAsking why the couples left the singles out of their dinners would be equally valid, in othet words, silly.\n.\nYou're not obligated to include everyone in every activity", "NTA. Your party was specifically for singles. That was the reason you were having the party in the first place! Because you didn't have partners to celebrate with.\n\nYour friends are being very defensive. And petty for not talking to the other people because only you \"actually apologized.\" What do the others who went to your party have to apologize for? Being invited to a party because they're single? \n\nYour \"friends\" in relationships don't sound very friendly. Then again you are all young, which perhaps explains their defensiveness.", "Kinda YTA. Galentine's Day is a celebration of friendship between women - not between just single women.\n\nYou singled out an entire segment of your friend circle and disqualified them because they're in relationships.  Are they still your friends even though they're in relationships?  They might not be after this, I hope you can repair the damage.\n\nETA:  \n>The friend-filled holiday dates back over a decade to season two, episode 16 of Parks and Rec.

You're definitely the problem.\n\nFor the record, Galentine's Day is supposed to be about expressing love for your girlfriends. I'm married and do Galentine's every year with my single best friend. So I would absolutely be offended if I were them. It comes off as jealous/bitter behavior, frankly.", "Ehhh... ESH\n\n\nYou knew they would be hurt if they were left out.

You're not single. And why be mad at the other girls when it was you OP who put the thing together and didn't invite them. That makes no sense. You apologized. They accepted. Everyone needs to move on and get over it. Unless something else went on you didn't know or post about.\n\nLook you guys are young and trying to play adults....but are still acting like children.

Its origin is the show Parks and Recreation; Leslie Knopp, the creator, was in a relationship at the time!", "YTA", "I think the issue here is the incredibly stupid label \"galentines\".  Since that implies, \"us gals out together\" that made amy female friends feel left out.  If you had called it \"singles celebration\" the intent would have been clear.  NAH.", "ESH I\u2019m gonna say everyone is an AH except Alex.\n\nY TA because you excluded Alex. You asked Alex if she was free then changed your mind about asking her. So know she knows that you know she is free but then hosted a get together you all normally have together without her. I would feel hurt too if my friends hung out without me when they knew I was free. \n\nI know you and some others will say its because of your excuse to celebrate your singleness but what does that even mean? There\u2019s nothing wrong with being single just like there\u2019s nothing wrong with being in a relationship. Both have their pros and cons and people can have their preference on what lifestyle they like. But I feel like celebrating being single is just hating on people who aren\u2019t. That\u2019s what it sounds like to me at least. Now, if you were celebrating being single by going to the club with the intent of flirting or hooking up or something I could understand that. Also Valentine\u2019s Day isn\u2019t about celebrating being IN A relationship it\u2019s about celebrating the relationship itself and your partner. So celebrating being single isn\u2019t the same. I guess you could argue that Galentines day is about celebrating the platonic friendships you have but you excluded one of those so you\u2019d still be the AH. \n\nI\u2019ll give you a pass for the others since to be fair they had plans. Maybe you should have told them why you were asking but it really shouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. \n\nThe other two friends are AH because they had plans, so it\u2019s weird of them to complain. Personally If I was in their situation with my friends, I wouldn\u2019t care because I would know my friends knew I was busy.\n\nEdit: Lol debate me", "galentines day is not just about celebrating your singleness its also about celebrating your girlfriends in general, so yeah you kind of are excluding them for having relationships. my friends and i celebrate the day before hell this year we arent doing it until the 26th. but im going with NTA because i dont believe you were aware of that and friends are allowed to hang out with out other people from the same group like life happens not everyone is always available.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
