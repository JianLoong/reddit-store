She is a user and has given you every indication that she will never change. \n\n\nAs others have said, it might be time to go NC if she refuses to respect your boundaries.", "Why are you still talking to her?? Why have you not gone no contact with all of them?? \n\nNTA For refusing to help your sister with her kids and telling her to ask your parents since you\u2019re so ungrateful, childish and spiteful. But holy hell there is something seriously wrong that you were still willing to be there as her little servant. I guarantee you that\u2019s the only reason your sister started buddying up to you a couple years ago was because she missed you being her little servant and running her errands. I get that you wanted to fulfill a lifelong dream of your sister actually liking you but you need to wake up to the fact that she has been playing you and will continue to only play you for the fool to be her little servant. Let go of that dream. Let it die. There is never any chance it can be reality. Go find a therapist who will help you get out of this situation before you realize you are 50 and still begging for their nonexistent love.", "NTA", "NTA... go NC with her. The dynamic will never change and it will constantly take you back to that terrible place emotionally. Your parents and sister can figure it out. You deserve to be happy  and valued by those around you.", "NTA and please go no-contact for everyone's sanity.", "NTA.  How you were treated as a child is not something to be forgotten or forgiven.  Your sister has also lied to you this whole time.  Personally I\u2019d go no contact with the lot of them.  You owe them nothing especially as how they have treated you.", "NTA and I'd absolutely go no contact with this entire mess.  Go fly and live your life away from these people.", "NTA.  Time to go LC or nC with these awful people.  I hope you have friends, at least, who can be your allies.  Best of luck!", "NTA, but your sister is. Looks like NC was actually the better way to go.", "NTA \n\nShe's reading what she sowed. Next she'll get your piratebay to pressure you.  Don't give in.", "NTA. Your sister came back into your life because she needed something. She hasn't changed, and that's obvious.\n\nSome bridges need to be destroyed as they don't serve  a purpose anymore and just take up space.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, I'm sorry your parents and sister were and are so shitty to you (I know what that's like).\n\nSecondly, they treat you like you are not part of the family, so honour that treatment by cutting them all off and leaving them to their own devices.\n\nThe three of them can figure their own lives out between them from now on. **No matter what situation they find themselves in, it is NOT your problem or responsibility to help.**\n\n*Go no contact. Block them all on every platform possible.*\n\nThen go live your best life from this day forward and surround yourself with people who value and love you.", "NTA. She only ever used you. None of them deserve you. Go find people who can love you for who you are, just as you are.", "NTA. \u201cIt takes a village\u2026\u201d kinda goes out the window when you burn a part of village to the ground.", "She has been using and manipulating you to do things for her. Stay away from these people, OP. While you are biologically linked to them, they are not your family. I hope you have good friends and people in your life who love and support you unconditionally.\n\nNTA of course and live a good life, OP!", "NTA.  Please look into therapy.  I wouldn't blame you for going NC with your sister and your parents.\n\nFamily isn't blood, family is who you would bleed for.  Your parents and sister have made it quite clear you are not worth their time.  Go out and make your own loving group and don't look back.", "\u201cI am no longer concerned with what you think of me. Your lack of support has been evident for a long time. I guess my lack of support will start now.\u201d \n\nNTA, and OP, you have the right to say no even without the back story. A favor is a favor; you always have to option as to what you want to volunteer for.", "NTA. If there was ever a clear and perfect case for going total No Contact with family, this is it. \n\nI have said it many times: \n\n**TOXIC PEOPLE DO NOT GET A PASS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILY.**", "are you serious? wtf are you putting yourself through that for? they're all disgusting. get away from them.\n\nNTA.", "Liars lie, and that doesn't change. She's manipulating you through the relationship you want to have to get anything she can out of you, which is why she's lashing out and treating you like shit any time you DON'T do something for her. This relationship is entirely one sided, and will vanish the moment you stop being her servant. \n\nNTA. These people don't deserve to have you in their life. Go NC and find better people to love!", "> I spoke to a trusted adult who said golden kids sometimes don't realize how wrong it is and can be really messed up by the favoritism but can grow to be better people. I was encouraged to keep the door open and told she might be my biggest ally. \n\nI\u2019m sorry a trusted adult told you this. They were wrong. In reality, the golden child dynamic rarely changes. Even in the cases where the golden child becomes the scapegoat\u2019s ally, the parents themselves do not want to change. They blame the scapegoat for trying to rock the boat.", "So why are you still speaking to any of them?\n\nNTA", "NOT your kids NOT your responsibility, if she still wants to be SPITEFUL towards you GO PERMANENT NO CONTACT and if you're able to move away cuz HOLY HECK YIKES to all that", "NTA", "She used you for free help and acted like she cared about you, if anyone is childish and petty it is her.  NTA, you don't owe her anything, go on with your life and realize that your future family will be people that you chose and not the one you were born into to, good luck", "> Three years ago Elizabeth came to me and said she hated how our parents treated me and she was sorry for being insensitive as a kid. We got close which I loved. She told me she basically had no contact with our parents. I found out a few months ago that it was a lie and she was always in contact with our parents and I found this out thanks to her throwing a party to celebrate the birth of her second child.\n\n(i.n.f.o. : Did she get pregnant or gave birth 3 years ago?)\n\n\nYour sister \"made amends\" with you when she realized she was pregnant or about to get pregnant and would need all the \"village\" she could muster. She never got close to you because she felt that you were hurt. She got close to you so she could use you. \n\nYour parents and your sister are A. You're NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear she is using you.\n\nSorry, it sounds like this has messed up your psyche.  Have you considered therapy?  \n\nStay away from toxic people, including family.  They will guilt trip you and then expect you to fix their mistakes.", "NTA\u2026she established the bad blood along with parents so stick to your guns and ignore her.", "So you are NTA.\n\nBut I am proud of you and the decisions you have made to not get involved.", "100% NTA, this is where you really need to consider cutting off all ties. You don't need this toxicity in your life.", "Girl, she is using you and you're letting her. There is no relationship to continue here. Forget about her and live your life without contact with them. They'll only bring pain and stress and there's already enough of that to go around not involving relationships.", "NTA. She has enough resources to draw upon that you don't need to take any more shit from her or anyone else.", "NTA Cut her off for good. She\u2019ll only cause you more and more pain. You deserve so much more.", "NTA consider going NC with the lot of them", "Sad to say but considering how many people I've met personally that have a favorite and/or whose parent's had a favorite, not to mention all the stories online, I think it's safe to say the number is far less than 99 percent.", "What they did for her was to give her emotional and mental abuse!!!!!", "Yeah, she feels like I should be glad they were so good to her and be grateful for that instead of angry they treated me like they did.", "Exactly this. We can't choose our family, but we can choose to never talk to them again.", "Very true. My blood pressure has gone way down since I went NC with a bunch of people.", "Congrats! Fellow former scapegoat here- 20 years!  To add to your wise comment, it is great revenge to these abusers when you do well for yourself in their absence.  They often declare that your life will be a disaster if you cut ties. Nothing makes them angrier when you \"disobey\" them and make a wonderful life for yourself in their absence.", "He's not dead, just injured, though I guess we don't know the extent of the injuries", "Well, it worked for a while, didn't it?", "Exactly, mom and dad need a pick on person (scapegoat) and often the GC becomes that person when the scapegoat no longer engages", "I don't think my parents see their treatment of me as a mistake. Just like they didn't consider it a mistake to tell a 5 year old she looked like someone they hated and that it bothered them.", "Yup. She doesn't want her sister back, she wants a free babysitter. \n\n\nNTA", "And your sister is SO toxic. She never meant her apology because her actions have shown nothing but her continued glorification of herself and her golden status. She hasn\u2019t changed. She won\u2019t change.

There's so much I have never talked about with others.", "Why not all three?", "Why not all three?", "Your story is a rare one.

I now know that can't happen.", "Damn, that was a woeful tale. \n\nNTA - Sometimes people can change or have no control over Golden Child syndrome. But OP's sister is purposefully manipulative and belittling. I hope OP find happiness and surrounds herself with a \"family\" of warm, caring people that can help her heal.

But I guess that's not always how these things end.", "I'd be happy to be the big sister OP SHOULD have had.", "Yeah, Elizabeth was pregnant when she reached out to me. She implied and I believed that it might have made her realize.", "OP, have you asked your sister, now that she has two kids, if she plans on treating them the way your parents treated the two of you? If she's not, it's time for her to wake the f* up. NTA", "That was too weird for words. I think your sister is delusional in addition to a conniving little wretch. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve been treated this way by your  pathetic excuse for a family.", "I feel for those grandkids because there's two now.\n\nNTA.  OP, seriously, I get why you thought maybe things might have changed but you've been SHOWN they haven't.  It is time to change your number, stop all contact with your parents and sister.  \n\nAnd before anyone downvotes me for recommending cutting contact with innocent niblings, I'll ask:  What on this earth do think sister and parents are gonna tell said niblings about OP?  Seriously??", "Are you sure you\u2019re not an affair baby?", "Just because they don't see it doesn't mean it wasn't wrong.", "Yeah. nothing hurts a kid like being compared to the worst person in the family. I am not saying that it is the worst thing to do to a kid, but it is in its own category of \"effed up\" on the psychological abuse scale.", "You need therapy if you are trying to see their point of view. They have really messed with your mind. They abused you. End of.", "Write them all off. Consider them nonexistent.", "Go fully NC now or you will be manipulated into being the free nanny.", "I can see why you'd want to cling to that hope and that connection, but it sounds like she is a product of her upbringing and will only continue to hurt you/use you", "This OP is time to take out the garbage from your life and live without that toxicity. Sharing DNA  doesn't force you to have any kind of relationship with them, any contact with the. Should be done on your terms, and if your terms are total no contact, well, no contact will be.", "Just because you share DNA doesn't make you family.

You seem to have low self-esteem because they have treated you like the black sheep of the family. Get some therapy.", "You are worthy and deserving of love.  To quote the fabulous Trudy from Mad Men, \"Stop going to that well.  There's no water there.\"\n\nJust think how much your birth family is going to be missing out when you're gone!", "This doesn't have to be the end. No contact now sounds like the best thing for you, but it doesn't mean that you sister won't realize things one day. I wouldn't hold my breath for it, and I think you should go no contact, but I wouldn't write it off entirely for the future. I don't think hope is a bad thing so long as you are also setting healthy boundaries for yourself.", "Just cut them off. You deserve better. She was just using you for free childcare and as a scapegoat for compliments. NTA", "I'm really sorry, and you deserve better, but your sister is just as much of an AH as your parents. I think you would be far better off without all three in your life. None of them are ever going to change if they haven't by now, and your sister either honestly believes she's better than you, or just doesn't care how badly it hurts you as long as she remains the favourite.", "Create your own new family. That can be just friends too. NTA", "Sorry, pretty, I really think that her apologies were less than genuine.  What she realized that above all is that a sister is another free babysitter to add to her roster, for when the parents aren't available. I suppose her husband is an only child or that there is a reason that makes it easier to just reach out to you than asking her in-laws for help when you guys' parents are too busy to take care of her kids?", "Ok but you now know for certain that she was lying to you for the entire time and that literally nothing whatsoever had changed... And yet you are still talking to her now? And you care about her thoughts and opinions, for some reason? Why?", "As sure as I can be. I apparently look like my mom's dad who walked out on her. I was told that often enough. They never said anything about me being an affair baby. Doesn't really matter at this point.", "There must be dozens of us!", "So to one up her deadbeat father, your mother decided to treat you in the exact same way her father treated her. And your own father didn't help. Amazing parenting /s. \n\nYou're NTA, you deserve so much better.", "I mean they are huge AHs no matter what. I get your mom hating her dad, not an excuse to treat you badly, but why would your dad hate him enough to punish his child who happens to look like his FIL. It just feels like an excuse for something else. Either way I\u2019m sorry that your family is awful. Might be time to cut them out and find your own family.", "Thousands. Perhaps more. Narcissists aren't that uncommon and that is a common threat in their parenting style.  I was always compared to my father's mother who they constantly talked shit about and then said I was just like her. I am nothing like her and very frankly, even though she was self absorbed, she was nowhere near the monster they made her out to be. My mom, on the other hand- malignant narcissist through and through.", "You clearly are unfamiliar with the dynamic of a narcissistic family. They often marry enablers so what the narc says, goes. The spouse of a narc is oftentimes the hench(person) of the narc. There was no reason for my parents to view me as lower than trash but the firstborn was their golden child and I was very different than her. They thought if they bullied me enough, they could turn me into her. Turns out, people are born with personality and no amount of hatred, abuse, and neglect will turn one person into another. After being a parent of two very different kids, it is immediately apparent how little I have to do with the personality the came with. Parents can bring the best out of their kids or bring the worst out of their kids with their actions and behaviors.", "I only talk to my sister and after posting here I see I need to cut her out as well. Seeing my parents at her house for the party was more contact with my parents than I ever wanted.", "Check out the subs r/EstrangedAdultKids and r/raisedbynarcissists\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether you know it or not, these are your ppl."]}
