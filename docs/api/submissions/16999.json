Childhood friend, going to call him F, (22M) lives abroad and has since they were 10. Bf & F got back in contact just before BF & I started dating. F regularly visits the UK and has been staying with us in our spare room for the last week. F lives in Greece.\n\nF flew to the UK to visit after around a month of planning. Both BF and F are into museums surrounding millitary and so we have gone to loads of museums, driven two hours either way to go everywhere F wanted to visit and have eaten everywhere F wanted to. I haven't minded at all and have been calm the whole time and nice towards F.\n\nF the entire trip has made several comments about my body in a sexual way. Continuous comments about my bum, my boobs and my thighs. I am not a thin woman but wear very conservative clothing. He has also made a lot of comments to BF about my body and about 'the things he would do to a woman like me'. F regularly has pointed out women in every single place we have been and has made extremely vulgar comments about them. \n\nEarlier in the week, I cooked dinner for us all and whilst BF was in the shower, F expressed how he had an erection over me being a 'proper woman' and described in detail how he was going to deal with this in the shower later on. \n\nToday, I have spent the day at my grandmother's as I have felt extremely uncomfortable and BF has been updating me through the day. F has said to him numerous times today how he was going to \"steal me from him\" and several other sexual comments that I cannot repeat. \n\nI have told BF that F will not be visiting again or staying here again but I feel absolutely awful because he has flown the whole way to visit BF and it's the first time they have seen each other since they were children. F has expressed that there are cultural differences in Greece and that this behaviour is normal and my lack of replies are making me a 'prude' as he says it's entirely a joke, which it could be, but it doesn't feel like it.", "created_utc": 1683836462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eyrxa/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_his_childhood_best/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I need outside opinions because I know I can often take things to heart and think that I'm the asshole for being mean when he's come all this way.

Your boyfriend is of he doesn't kick that guy out of your home for sexually harassing you. That'd downright terrifying that he openly does that.", "NTA. When I first read the title I thought... Probably being an arsehole. After reading, 100% NTA. Cultural differences my ass.", "Oh please, these comments would be unacceptable anywhere in the world! F is a sexist pig and a bully, and you have every right to never see him again. NTA", "NTA - Ew. Sexual harassment isn\u2019t \u201cculture.\u201d He\u2019s hiding behind a smokescreen and lies.\n\nI hope your boyfriend is standing by your side/standing up for you? Honestly, I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t kicked F out for his comments. He\u2019s not obligated to entertain someone harassing his girlfriend, especially when his harassment *made you feel unsafe* and *drove you away from your own home.*\n\nWanting to feel safe in your own home is the most reasonable boundary anyone could ever have. Do not allow him back into your space.", "NTA\n\nAnd this isn't \"cultural differences\". \n\nTelling you once or twice that you're very attractive or even sexy might be down to cultural differences. Waiting until your boyfriend is out of the room and then describing his masturbation fantasies to you in detail, I ASSURE YOU, does not come from Greek or any other ethnic culture. Not to mention that there are plenty of Greek men who have lovely manners, are gentlemen, and would be absolutely horrified that this man is trying to justify being completely sleazy as representative of their culture.\n\nHe isn't just flirting, or telling you how pretty you are, he's sexually harassing you, over and over again, even when you are clearly uncomfortable, and clearly noticing (and possibly enjoying) your discomfort if he's called you a prude. \n\nYou are NTA; you would have been well within your rights to confront him after the first or second time he said something really inappropriate, and asked him WTH he thought he was doing.  Furthermore, you and/or your boyfriend would also have been within your right to ask him to cut his trip short and go home.\n\nYou also have nothing to feel guilty about. You say that you feel bad that he's come all this way to visit your BF. But he doesn't feel bad for treating you like absolute garbage and making you feel unsafe in your own home. You don't owe it to someone who treats you badly to make them welcome, no matter how far they've traveled.", "NTA\n\nHow is your BF reacting? Because he should be equally alarmed by this bullshit his supposed friend is pulling.", "Crazy how people will quote \"cultural differences\" for justifying inappropriate behaviour. \n\nNTA.", "I dated a Greek man and he never ever expressed vulgarity towards me. I\u2019ve visited  Greece and I\u2019ve never saw any man talking like that.\n\nNTA!! That guy is a predator, this is not appropriate and your bf is not defending you as he should", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual fuck? I hate it when people use the excuse of it being a \"cultural\" thing to excuse their disgusting behavior. \n\nNo one should have to be told by basically a stranger how they will satisfy themselves in the shower thinking about THEM. What the hell has your boyfriend been saying? That is so wildly inappropriate and he needs to shut that shit down. It shouldn't be you confronting his friend either, he's HIS responsibility. Not yours.\n\nIs this really the type of person your boyfriend wants to be friends with???", "NTA. At all.\nI am very, very disappointed in your boyfriend, though.", "NTA and nope nope nope.  Living in Greece doesn't give him a pass to be rude to you or make you uncomfortable.  Your BF should have your back on this.  Since you both live in your home, you get veto power over guests (as does he).  If you don't want the old friend staying in your home, he can get a hotel or stay home.", "F F.  That guys sucks.  NTA, OP", "NTA, this is extremely disturbing and creepy behavior. I don't care if attitudes are like that in other parts of the world, you have a right to feel comfortable in your own house. That your bf doesn't have your back says a lot about his character.", "NTA, \n\n He is disgusting. Everything abouthim is but the erection and shower comment are the last straw.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend needs to take his head out of his ass and stop making excuses for this guy.", "NTA, your guest is, and so is your boyfriend for allowing that guy to disrespect you like that. In your shoes, this would make me reconsider the relationship.", "NTA. Cultural differences or not, he\u2019s a guest making you uncomfortable in your own home. That makes him an asshole the whole world over", "NTA and it would be a red flag for me if your boyfriend stayed in contact with F after this.\nBlaming it on culture seems like he won't change his ways", "NTA. Cultural differences aren't an excuse to be a creep.", "NTA and it\u2019s not a fucking joke. While your boyfriend isn\u2019t around he described in detail how he would later masturbate to the thought of you. None of this is cultural or a joke, he\u2019s just a pig.", "NTA. If its a cultural difference then he should be told to respect your culture and stop making comments. Its not appropriate. If your BF isn't able to say that then no his friend can't stay at your place.", "how can your boyfriend just sit there listening to all this? would make me rethink things", "NTA - Your home, your rules. Your BF should have your back and the fact that he doesn't, is a red flag.\n\nMaybe his eagerness to finally see his friend has warped some sensibilities that he may have had, but saying \"cultural differences\" does not excuse him (the friend).", "NTA\n\nCultural sensitivity here is an excuse, and not a good one. I don't care if women walk around naked in Greece; F is being TA.\n\nIf I were you, **which I am not,** I would tell BF that I won't be back until F is gone. Additionally, I would tell BF that if F visits again, BF will need to get a hotel room, and either F or you will stay there, since F is a crass, vulgar, and generally unlikable #%$\\*$\\_@(\\*$.", "NTA. I don't get people who hold onto toxic childhood friends. Yeah, you grew up with them but clearly you outmatured them? \n\nI had 2 best pals in HS that I kept in contact with after HS.\n\n1 of them wound up in prison for pedo crap so I cut him off instantly.\n\nThe other got super duper religious and forced me out of the place we were renting together after he found out I had \"relations\" before marriage with my now wife so...
