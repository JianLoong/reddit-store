This is a throwaway to try and maintain some privacy, even though I think I'll need to be pretty specific here just because of the nature of the situation. \n\nI (29F) am pregnant with my and my husband's first child. I'm seven months along, and we found out earlier on that we're having a baby girl. Both of us are already absolutely in love, but we haven't been able to decide on a name.\n\nMy husband (30M) was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. He is currently going through chemo, but his treatment isn't working. His oncologist suspects that he will pass within the next six months, so while he will get to meet our baby girl, she won't know him. We're both absolutely devastated and have been spending a lot of time in the hospital while he receives his treatment.\n\nWe've recently been watching the Star Wars movies together while he undergoes chemo. He used to love them as a kid, so it's been a huge comfort to him. I've been enjoying them as well, and it's nice to have something to take our minds off of the situation we're in.\n\nThe issue only arose when he said that he had come up with a baby name for our daughter. I have already agreed to give him primary naming privileges; since he won't be around for most of her life, I want her to have a name that will help her feel connected to her father. However, the name he suggested was absolutely absurd: he wants to name our daughter Anakin Skywalker. First name Anakin, middle name Skywalker. I was so confused and asked if he was joking, but he got frustrated. \n\nI understand that Star Wars has been a large comfort to him, and that he may not be fully in sound mind because of the intensity of his chemo. But I can't reasonably name my daughter Anakin Skywalker; not even because of the Star Wars association, but because of the character's role. And it's simply not a good name for a baby girl. \n\nI asked if we could compromise and name her Anna Skye, or maybe look into different names from the franchise (like Leia) but he's very insistent that he only wants her to be named Anakin. He says that he'd be willing to get rid of Skywalker, but Anakin is a must for him. \n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. I told him no and that we need to value our daughter's quality of life more than his interests, which really seemed to hurt him. He's been very quiet for a few days because of it, but I'm not sure how to compromise. I want our daughter to be named by her father, but this is too far for me. \n\nAm I the Asshole for standing my ground on this?", "created_utc": 1683581172, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c5dms/aita_for_turning_down_my_terminally_ill_husbands/", "score": 1426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That sort of thing, however, comes with the implicit understanding that they're going to be responsible and mature about it, and not saddle their daughter with a name that's some sex pun or an unreadable string of consonants, or... this.\n\nCondemning your daughter to a lifetime of social abuse for being named after Darth Freaking Vader is not a fair trade for the satisfaction of that child's father, *regardless* of whether his lifespan is measured in years or in days. And for the people here who argue that, no, surely childhood won't be THAT bad... ignore them.

It's important to consider the child's well-being and future when selecting a name, and Anakin Skywalker may lead to unnecessary attention, confusion, and even bullying. It's also understandable that your husband may not be in the right state of mind due to his illness and treatment, but ultimately, the decision should be made with the child's best interests in mind.

I think Anna Skye was a really good compromise. And I mean seriously, it would be one thing if Anakin was the hero of the story. Plus I can tell you really wanted to let him have this but I\u2019m with you and that exact name is just a dealbreaker unfortunately.", "Lie. Lie lie lie lie lie. I don't know exactly how birth certificates work in your area. Do you both have to sign? Can only you sign? If so, lie like lie lie lie. \"Certainly, my love. Anakin Skywalker it is.\" That's what you say. What you put on the birth certificate is \"Anna.\" \n\nI'm so sorry your family is going through this. I also think you're right in saying that  your husband may not be of sound mind, at the moment. When my mom was dying of pancreatic cancer ... the mix of the pain meds and the effect a dying pancreas has on the brain left my her out of her mind. It's entirely possible that \"Healthy Dad\" would look at \"Sick Dad\" and say, \"Buddy, what are you thinking?\" Best of luck to you.", "NTA, leia is such a pretty name and you're making your daughter a favor by not naming her Anakin (that's such an awful name)", "Later on you can change it to Darth Vader.\n\nNTA", "what about Annika or Anika?

Anna Skye sounds really cute actually.", "OP, I highly recommend taking some greif counseling sessions with your husband and without to help prepare you for such a large life change. Please focus on YOUR support network as well. \n\nI was really waiting for it to be a reasonable name.

I think Anna Skye is a perfect lovely name and a great alternative to his primary choice.", "NTA. You are thinking of your daughter and her future. That\u2019s a name that will give her grief.

My father died of pancreatic cancer and it is the worst. \nbut no. Anakin (Darth Vader) literally committed mass genocide by blowing up a planet. He\u2019s a murderer.

I cannot imagine what you two are going through as you have the best thing that could ever happen to you and the worst thing that could ever happen occurring simultaneously.\n\nOP, have you asked him why it\u2019s so important?  Is he hoping she will be a Star Wars fan and think of him every time she watches one of the movies?  Or every time she tells someone her name she\u2019ll laugh and say \u201cMy Dad picked it for me\u201d?   If he feels this strongly there must be something behind it and given his prognosis I suspect it has to do with her thinking of him.  She\u2019ll be so young when he passes that she won\u2019t have any memories if him so the name might be his way of ensuring she thinks of him from time to time.\n\nJust gonna toss this out there but what about reversing it to Nikana (nik-AH-na or Nik-Anna) Her nickname could be Nikki or Ana.", "NTA Do not name her Anakin, and he's being a bit cruel leveraging his situation for such a poorly considered demand", "NTA, get a pet and call it that, your daughter deserves a proper name", "Hahahaha!

But I imagine Annakin would be a super tough name to grow up with and you need to do what you feel is best for your daughter's future (and I personally agree that not blatantly naming her after a fictional character is for the best).\n\n I don't think it would be a terrible middle name if that's a compromise you'd be up for.

A month later at his next PET scan, they found that this caused the cancer to shrink 45% and to be encapsulated in the pancreas. They sent him to MD Anderson to get radiation and the Whipple surgery.

This is a throwaway to try and maintain some privacy, even though I think I'll need to be pretty specific here just because of the nature of the situation. \n\nI (29F) am pregnant with my and my husband's first child. I'm seven months along, and we found out earlier on that we're having a baby girl. Both of us are already absolutely in love, but we haven't been able to decide on a name.\n\nMy husband (30M) was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. He is currently going through chemo, but his treatment isn't working. His oncologist suspects that he will pass within the next six months, so while he will get to meet our baby girl, she won't know him. We're both absolutely devastated and have been spending a lot of time in the hospital while he receives his treatment.\n\nWe've recently been watching the Star Wars movies together while he undergoes chemo. He used to love them as a kid, so it's been a huge comfort to him. I've been enjoying them as well, and it's nice to have something to take our minds off of the situation we're in.\n\nThe issue only arose when he said that he had come up with a baby name for our daughter. I have already agreed to give him primary naming privileges; since he won't be around for most of her life, I want her to have a name that will help her feel connected to her father. However, the name he suggested was absolutely absurd: he wants to name our daughter Anakin Skywalker. First name Anakin, middle name Skywalker. I was so confused and asked if he was joking, but he got frustrated. \n\nI understand that Star Wars has been a large comfort to him, and that he may not be fully in sound mind because of the intensity of his chemo. But I can't reasonably name my daughter Anakin Skywalker; not even because of the Star Wars association, but because of the character's role. And it's simply not a good name for a baby girl. \n\nI asked if we could compromise and name her Anna Skye, or maybe look into different names from the franchise (like Leia) but he's very insistent that he only wants her to be named Anakin. He says that he'd be willing to get rid of Skywalker, but Anakin is a must for him. \n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. I told him no and that we need to value our daughter's quality of life more than his interests, which really seemed to hurt him. He's been very quiet for a few days because of it, but I'm not sure how to compromise. I want our daughter to be named by her father, but this is too far for me. \n\nAm I the Asshole for standing my ground on this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, that would be a hard no for me as well. \n\nMaybe first name is Anna middle name Kim,\nAnna Kim?", "My SIL and BIL named their child after Star Wars.

Anakin would be a terrible name, he\u2019s being selfish he\u2019s not the 1 who will have to live with the name, I know he\u2019s terminally ill but that doesn\u2019t give him free reign to come up with a stupid name and insist that\u2019s your daughters name.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStand your ground to protect your daughter from this assholish plan.", "My heart goes out to you.\n\nCan you avoid the subject?

Offer Anakin as a second middle name at most? There\u2019s no good outcome to your daughter being called Anakin Skywalker.", "NAH. This is an insanely difficult experience to live through for all.

Maybe put a little more forethought into things you agree to in the future. Especially important things like agreeing to let someone name your baby. Because now your choices are (1) not honoring an agreement with your spouse or (2) saddling your daughter with a less than ideal name. Both of which suck.\n\nI'm not going to pass judgment but you might be wise not to paint yourself into no-win corners like this again.", "NTA.

And she\u2019s going to ask why. And if you tell her it\u2019s because it\u2019s what her dying dad was adamant on, that could tarnish that relationship.

There's also Rey for a more modern sounding name, but it varies on if he likes the newer movies. Mara Jade is also a female character in the non-movie versions of Star Wars and her name is adorable. \n\n\nMy point is, you're right.

The name process came up and we decided to let my daughter pick girl names and dad would pick the boy names.  The very first name dad wanted to use was Anakin Skywalker.  I could not believe I was hearing it.  I told him no because: our kid could hate Star Wars and even hate us the rest of our lives for naming him that, our kid would be teased/bullied over the name in school, and finally it was just too much to deal with.  Dad came up with a lot of other names but none fit for some reason.  He started looking through whatever he got his hands on for names even the Holy Bible.  He got to the part where the disciples were called and the first ones were Simon and Andrew.  We turned it around and I spelled Simon as Simeon for my great grandpa who was my grandmother's dad.  She was pleased as pie.  I was pleased as pie too because not only did using my great grandpa's name for the middle name work, Andrew was another name I loved a lot too.  As for sister and her name choices, she settled for Emily or Rebecca because she was unsure which she liked better.
