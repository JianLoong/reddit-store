Charlie passed away from a heart attack a few years ago. \n\nSarah rudely informed me that she and Greg weren\u2019t going to have children. She didn\u2019t let Greg speak at all, and told me \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry a child for nine months and Greg and I both have very busy careers so we wouldn\u2019t have time for a kid. Neither of us want to be parents.\u201d \n\nI was shocked. Greg is my only child so he\u2019s my only hope for grandchildren. I said to Sarah that family should be more important than a career and suggested she could take a few years out of work or become a stay at home mother. Greg is an accountant and Sarah is a lawyer so they have more than enough money. \n\nGreg told me to leave it alone but I was distraught. It feels like Sarah doesn\u2019t even care about marrying Greg and having a family with him. \n\nGreg said he would uninvite me from the wedding if I kept pushing so I\u2019ll leave it alone for now. I just hope they change their minds\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to expect my son to have a family one he\u2019s married but other family members have said I was in the wrong \n\nI don\u2019t think so but am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1668886437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzk256/aita_for_wanting_grandchildren/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Charlie passed away from a heart attack a few years ago. \n\nSarah rudely informed me that she and Greg weren\u2019t going to have children. She didn\u2019t let Greg speak at all, and told me \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry a child for nine months and Greg and I both have very busy careers so we wouldn\u2019t have time for a kid. Neither of us want to be parents.\u201d \n\nI was shocked. Greg is my only child so he\u2019s my only hope for grandchildren. I said to Sarah that family should be more important than a career and suggested she could take a few years out of work or become a stay at home mother. Greg is an accountant and Sarah is a lawyer so they have more than enough money. \n\nGreg told me to leave it alone but I was distraught. It feels like Sarah doesn\u2019t even care about marrying Greg and having a family with him. \n\nGreg said he would uninvite me from the wedding if I kept pushing so I\u2019ll leave it alone for now.

I agree with you on every level. \n\nI would like to add: if you OP truly feels you need to fulfill a grandmother role maybe you could be one for a child that really needs one. There are a lot of organisations, volunteering jobs and programs you could help out with and be a role model for a child or maybe multiple children. I know a few great women who do these kind of things and a lot of children see them as a sort of grandmother they love dearly. Maybe you could be one for your community. \n\nBut the most important thing: you cannot force your son and DIL to get children. They need to want them for themselves.
