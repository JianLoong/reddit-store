The reason for this was, because he has slept in but not actively sick? or maybe he is still fighting an ear infection maybe? \n\n&#x200B;\n\neither way that is deceptive and can see how the ex would be pissed", "YTA.  I wonder what your reaction would be if your ex-husband did the same?\n\nYou had him change the plans even though it was his Halloween with your son, then decided to keep your son home.  \n\nYou could have text him and let him know your kept your son home for extra rest and let him know he could pick him up from you at the original time of 3:30.  It then would have been up to your ex-husband to decide whether you could keep him until 4:30.", "I'd say YTA for not letting him know when he asked if the school knew about the pick-up switch.  You didn't actively lie, but you decided to omit a change in plans for some reason. \n\nDropping him off at 4:30 isn't that terrible as it had been previously agreed on, but the reasoning had changed, your ex agreed to give you an hour so that you could celebrate with your son, but having spent all day with him, that hour wasn't actually needed, you presumably had plenty of time to celebrate when he was supposed to be at school. \n\nHe changed his plans to accommodate you, and lost some of his scheduled time because of it, then you decided to run with it and take your son out of school for the day to get even more. \n\nOverall, I don't think you did anything truly unforgivable, but if you and your ex want to be successful co-parents you need to communicate, even if you have the right to change the plan. Major changes in schedule are the type of thing that should be mentioned even if it's during your custody time.", "In the comments you keep criticising your ex and blaming him as the reason you did this. I don't expect you to like him so I'm taking anything you say about him with a pinch of salt.\n\nI assume that at this point in time your (soon to be ex) husband dislikes you and doesn't trust you. So it really was not very clever of you to give him reason to distrust you further.

If it's a trend that he can prove to a judge... no bueno", "YTA, and I think you\u2019ve known it and this post is pointless from your responses", "I HIGHLY recommend sticking to the agreement exactly from here on out. I've been on both sides of these kinds of issues and agreeing to side deals for any reason is asking for trouble. You should have stuck to giving him his Halloween time and had your ex return him to your house per the agreement. Then there is zero room for confusion and no need for conflict.", "ESH the kid never should go to school sick! The poor kid has zero real routine with the parenting schedule you have chose. Think of your kid ffs!", "YTA not really for keeping him home from school but just for not communicating about it. \n\nYou and your ex are in for a solid 15 more years of coparenting. Try to focus on the long game. It may be awkward to have these conversations right now while your separation is fresh but consider that you are building the foundation for the next phase of your relationship. Every moment of open communication and honesty now is building up the trust you\u2019re going to need from each other later. The more you avoid being honest now, the less well this coparenting relationship will go in the long term and the worse it will be for your son. \n\nYou should apologize to your ex. Tell him that you weren\u2019t trying to be sneaky but you can understand how the way you communicated could have been interpreted as sneaky and you\u2019re sorry and you won\u2019t do it again. Him demanding honesty from you is good because you can demand it from him in return. \n\nPS. You should just expect that your toddler will tell your ex literally all your business. Kids that age have no filter. Just another reason it\u2019s easier to be honest from the jump anyway.", "NTA its daycare not kindergarten so the kid at 3 missed a day which happens to be Halloween.  It\u2019s not going to ruin his academic life.  Also OP had arranged to have ex pick the child up an hour later than normal.  So no big deal he picks him up at agreed upon time.  It\u2019s not deceptive if the child is actively fighting an ear infection.  Sleep is the best thing for him.  It\u2019s what\u2019s best for the child not the ex\u2019s schedule.

(I have him Mon/Tues, he has him Weds/Thurs and we alternate weekends Fri/Sat/Sun). This year is my ex\u2019s year to have our son on Halloween (agreement is 5-7 for trick or treating but I okayed the overnight for my son\u2019s sleep schedule), but would be my normal custody day. I had him overnight Monday and had planned to drop my son off at daycare/montessori where my ex was going to pick him up afterwards at the normal time of 3:30pm. The day prior my ex agreed that I could pick up my son up and keep him for an hour to give him a Halloween surprise and drop him off at 4:30 so he could take my son trick-or-treating. My ex reluctantly agreed but changed his original plans to accommodate this. \n\nHalloween morning my son slept in (he\u2019s been fighting an ear infection and sleeping later before to adjust to the upcoming time change). My son slept in very late, and instead of a late drop off I decided to keep my son home from school/daycare to spend the day together to celebrate Halloween and have an easy day. I did not tell my ex about this because in our parenting agreement we have decision making ownership when it is our parenting time. My ex did text me asking me if the school knew of the pickup switch (because the original plan). I said the school did know, but I didn\u2019t elaborate. \nWhile trick-or-treating our son volunteers to his Dad (ex) that he stayed at home with Mommy all day and my ex is pissed that I kept him out of school, didn\u2019t inform him and didn\u2019t bring him to his house at 3:30 since we spent the day together. \n\nMontessori doesn\u2019t celebrate any holiday, including Halloween and I thought it would be fun since I had the day free and since my son slept in late he had his nap later, napping until 3:45. \n\nI walk on eggshells with my ex and try to avoid any unnecessary contact with him and honestly was avoiding an argument about keeping my son home in the first place plus to avoid bait and switching his drop off time since he had to change plans the day before. \n\nMy son was dropped off at 4:30, rested and happy - but my ex is believes I am sneaky and was being manipulative.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your ex had already agreed to change his plans so you could have your son for an hour after school but then when you kept him from school for the whole day (understandable if he\u2019s sick) you STILL kept him for that extra hour and didn\u2019t tell him. That\u2019s messed up.", "He\u2019s still fighting an ear infection, has ear drops but had gone to school/daycare the day before. He was fighting going to school in the morning and I made the call to keep him home, but you\u2019re right I should have communicated with his Dad.", "You\u2019re right. I should have communicated. My ex can be incredibly difficult and is adamant about teaching our son to stick to commitments. While I agree with him I tend to be more flexible especially while he\u2019s so young and not feeling 100%.\n\nIf he did this I would probably understand, but would want communication. If we keep our child home on our parenting day we aren\u2019t required to communicate (today was my parenting day, but his Dad had him for trick-or-treating) and I allowed the overnight to keep my son\u2019s bedtime routine intact. The agreement is otherwise 5-7 if on the other parents day, but we had made a variety of exceptions. \n\nI realize this was me just trying to avoid my ex because of anxiety and I need to be the bigger person and get over it.", "You\u2019re right, I should have communicated with him.  \n\nThe parenting plan is we get our son 5-7 for trick-or-treating, no overnight) if Halloween doesn\u2019t fall on our parenting day. He still is overnight at his Dad\u2019s this year because it\u2019s less change for him during the week while he is so young.", "My ex is turbulent and I tend to be conflict avoidant. I realize this was a poor move on my part but my decision was rooted in avoiding the initial debate of my son staying home from daycare.", "100% one-off and why I posted here for feedback because it didn\u2019t sit right.", "I agree on the sick part, his Dad stresses going to school because of the cost (Montessori is expensive but my preferred choice because of the curriculum).\nI don\u2019t like the parenting schedule, but it\u2019s better than what we had previously of alternating every 2 days then weekends. It was so inconsistent. \nI can\u2019t afford a bigger legal fight on the custody schedule and my ex is very difficult. At least now my son knows which days during the week he is at mine vs his Dad\u2019s, and as he gets older his opinion can hopefully change what works for him.", "totally agree, it\u2019s a hard transition for me but the right thing is to just communicate upfront. \nI did apologize and said I\u2019d be straightforward and transparent going forward.", "I get that. Part of my logic was because my son would  be napping into that time because his sleep schedule was off, but I should have communicated that.", "Say something went wrong, like  a disaster at the daycare. Dire, quake, truck collision, etc. Your ex would have been uninformed that his kid was not at risk.", "I think you should really think about changing the policy on informing each other about staying home.  Thats a fairly major change of schedule.  It may not seem super important at preschool level but it can be much more important to know how much time has been missed as your child starts to get older.  \n\nIm not suggesting anyone needs permission,  but a courtesy message sent to the co-parent just to keep them in the loop would be a good habit to build early.", "You are not conflict avoidant.

However, a quick text to let him know your son is at home sick is just basic co-parenting, not \"unnecessary contact\".Seeing your son was going to his father's that afternoon, the fact that he might be sick was important information, that would have helped his father do some contingency planning in case your son had to stay home the next day as well. Yes, it would have meant losing your bonus hour, but you did get several bonus hours by keeping him home. \n\nIf you are selective about little details like this, of course your ex is going to think you are \"sneaky and manipulative.\"", "YTA and you know you are.  You deliberately kept info from your son's father, even through a call where you had the opportunity to, even though he agreed to a change in plan.  Of course YTA.", "If your son wasn't where he was supposed to be all day and you had no idea where he was, would you be comfy and happy about that? If there was an emergency at daycare, and you panicked and went to save your kid and he wasn't there, would you be happy about that? YTA, lordy, split custody only works with honesty. You've described your ex as being accommodating to YOU and YOUR wants, so none of this is reasonable from you.\n\nYou just gave your ex reason to be difficult, to not trust you.", "YTA. Your ex already changed his plays for you, and you decided to trample over his time and plans and couldn't even bother telling him.

It comes across as a little petty TBH and I\u2019m not surprised your ex was annoyed.", "YTA. This is the type of bullshit that will poison your co-parenting. Keep things above board.

But you wanted to have that extra hour too. Then on top of that allowing the kid to nap late, because you knew that would make bedtime difficult. \n   You are not doing your son any favors, if anything you are confusing him more. He is three, you are using him to try and get at your ex. As he gets older  he will see this and when he is old enough  he will pick sides and I am afraid you will be on the losing side. \n\n  Funny how Mom's who get 50/50 custody always seem to try and make Dad look like the bad guy when they are the ones that make things complicated.", "You should have told your ex about your son not going to day care.\n\nIf you start a train of poor communication, it will lead to a worsening of the situation which will play out badly for your son and all of you.\n\nYTA", "YTA - would one text message have really killed you?", "YTA.

You had an opportunity and you CHOSE not to tell him.\n\nIf he hadn't contacted you I would have gone with NAH because it's just an hour and not a huge deal (IMO), and people don't like being interrupted at work (assuming he works), but you basically lied to him.", "YTA.

If the kid is still sick, there should be a conversation over whether it makes sense to make then move them to the other parents house for custody purposes, or is it better to let them stay where they are and rest.  If that, who stays home from work the next day if the child is still ill?  All of these considerations should be discussed, or if they clearly fall into your parenting plan agreement, and there is already a defined protocol, you should at least share the information so the other parent can be beat prepared when the next handoff occurs and can support you/ their child in the interim if they aren\u2019t well or have non-routine needs.", "She also kept medical information from him because she is claiming he had an ear infection.

It seems like a very awkward setup to have one parent pick up then almost immediately drop off. \n\nThe issue I have with her \"conflict avoidant\" nature here is that it is what is actually causing the conflict in the first place.  She doesnt mention her ex being angry about missed school but about her being deceiptful and manipulative.  Answering about the school knowing the change of pickup details when she knew that information was irrelevant was the thing that caused the conflict in the first place.  \n\nIf she does have a history of being \"bowled over\" in argument with her ex, ( which I dont remember seeing a lot of evidence for unless its in a comment i missed)   that is something she needs to address.
