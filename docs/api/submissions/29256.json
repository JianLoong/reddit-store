Uh-uh. Dog ownership does not work that way. They were the ones who left it in a place the dogs could potentially reach it, knowing full well that they're in their puppy chewing stage. \n\nAs far as puppies are concerned, anything they can get their teeth on is fair game, and it's up to their owners to make sure anything they don't want to end up as a chew toy is out of their reach.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \nThe problem arose from Funko Pop placement. The fault is entirely your SIL\u2019s.", "NTA.  EVERYTHING they value should have already been moved out of any chance of puppy reach.  That means off surfaces puppies could climb on other things to reach or furniture a puppy could knock over, and closets should be closed tight.  Anyone that has had a dog will tell you at some time they try to reach things on a kitchen table.  Dogs can be quite creative when they really want to get somewhere.  This is on brother and SIL.", "One puppy-proofs their home when one has puppies, just like one does with babies. \n\nINFO: Who do the puppies belong to? One to each (you/your brother/SIL together)? All of you as a group?\n\nIt\u2019s important because puppy-proofing needs to/should be done by the puppy\u2019s owners - other house residents are not responsible EXCEPT for their own possessions (as in, keeping them away from the puppy). \n\nEither way, brother and SIL are responsible for leaving a delicious gnaw-able cube of mystery  within reach of puppies who are in the cleverest stage of their lives XD \n\nAlso, it\u2019s just a dang Funko. Unless it\u2019s limited edition, aren\u2019t those things cheap af these days?  (Also, when did they start making Funkos of ACTUAL REAL PEOPLE? I feel so old now.)", "NTA. Even if the dogs had been yours, you'd still be NTA: they left stuff in a location they knew a dog could reach in a room they knew dogs would be.

It's a Funko Pop.", ">my brother and SIL insisted that because I was home alone with the dogs, I'm responsible for the damage\n\nBasically saying you must supervise the dogs constantly in case your SIL has left something within reach.

Doesn't sound like that's the case. If you *wanted* to be nice and offer half, you could, but not at all a cent more because it was not your responsibility (I don't think you should pay any fwiw).
