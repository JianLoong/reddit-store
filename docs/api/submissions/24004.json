My wife and I have a 2mo son. Prior to going to this get together we brought I bottle worth and one diaper and the agreement that I would take care of our son all night so she could sleep REALLY good. (we live 1 house down) with the intent of making an appearance hanging out, grabbing something to eat and leaving. The food wasn\u2019t done for probably about an hour after we showed up(smoked ribs weren\u2019t quite done) after about 3hrs of me cutting and talking with people I work with the baby started fussing. My wife said he was probably hungry and that she was going to go to the house and feed him and she would see me there and to make sure I ate. I asked her if she wanted me to bring her a plate, and she said no. \nI brought her a plate of what food was left(because if I didn\u2019t she would\u2019ve been upset) this whole time I had 1 mixed drink 2 beers and 2 shots. The time between she left and the time that I walked home was about 30mins. \n\nAfter coming home she refused to let me take our son so she could do whatever it is she wanted to do because she said that I was too drunk to care for our son all night. I admit I was on  the tipsy side, but was far from drunk. \n\nShe was mad that I came home later than her, and told me to go away. That she didn\u2019t want to be around me.\n\nSo I did exactly that. I went into the garage and continued building and finishing the clothes rack for our son. Then the neighbors invited me to play darts in the garage(we only played 2 games and we share an adjoining garage wall)\n\nMy wife said she was locking the house up for the night so she could sleep, I told her I was in the garage and to not lock the garage door. \n\nShe locked the house completely even though I said not to. Only after an hour of questioning why she locked the garage door and why she was REALLY upset with me did she come unlock the door. \n\nAITA for doing exactly what she said by leaving her alone?\n\nEdit: we came home about 730-8 she wasn\u2019t intending on going to bed prior to 10pm. So she didn\u2019t expect me to take care of the baby alone until at least after 10pm\n\nEdit 2: normally the agreement is I take care of the baby from 10pm-3am and she covers 330am-730-8am. I was offering to care for the baby the entirety of the night(which meant I slept zero hours because I sleep so heavily I don\u2019t hear the baby when he wakes up)", "created_utc": 1691319637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jmu1p/aita_for_doing_exactly_what_my_wife_said/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. You have a baby. Time to man up and be responsible.", "Omg, how do you not see YTA. You fucked up. You promised to look after your baby so your wife could rest and you came home later and tipsy. That is so inappropriate and irresponsible. You are being an asshole with your whole 'malicious compliance'. Yes, you're doing what she told you to do. Because she was so angry, that was her passive-aggressive way of telling you to fuck off. I say it to my hubby when I'm really pissed off, too.

Again, you agreed to be in charge of the baby that night but she had to do it because you chose to drink.\n\n\u2022 After you were let off the hook withthe baby, you decided it would be a good idea to continue having fun by playing games with the neighbors. This was *after* she had to pick up your slack because you chose to drink. \n\nYour title is misleading. You didn\u2019t do anything you agreed to in advance. The only thing you did right was making sure the mother of your child had dinner to eat that night, but you 100% deserved to be locked out. \n\nA piece of advice. Just give it up now. Stop drinking. It\u2019s going to get you no where fast. If you don\u2019t have the strength to say no, on a night you agreed to be the soul caregiver to your newborn, you\u2019re in for years and years of misery because you\u2019re going to choose booze over your own family every. single. time. \n\nYTA.

If you need the internet to tell you that then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be married.

After all that instead of apologize he directly goes to the garage??? And now you're questioning why is she so upset. If this women needs to sleep so badly and he doesn't it's clear that she take care of baby most of the time. This man needs to stop acting like a teenager but like a man with a partner and a baby. Plus he was expecting his wife to give him the baby while he was drunk, it was clearly dangerous fir the baby to be with him while he was drunk.", "Yeah, it's a great mystery why is this woman pissed at the OP, who get drunk when he was supposed to take care over their kid. /S", "He literally says he had all those drinks in the time span of her being gone and he even admits to being tipsy when he got home and tried to take over baby duties. No one who is under the influence should be in charge of the baby; one he probably smelled like alcohol and two tipsy is enough to stumble and loose coordination and what happens if that were to happen when holding the baby or anything?
