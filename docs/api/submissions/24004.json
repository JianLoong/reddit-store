My wife and I have a 2mo son. Prior to going to this get together we brought I bottle worth and one diaper and the agreement that I would take care of our son all night so she could sleep REALLY good. (we live 1 house down) with the intent of making an appearance hanging out, grabbing something to eat and leaving. The food wasn\u2019t done for probably about an hour after we showed up(smoked ribs weren\u2019t quite done) after about 3hrs of me cutting and talking with people I work with the baby started fussing. My wife said he was probably hungry and that she was going to go to the house and feed him and she would see me there and to make sure I ate. I asked her if she wanted me to bring her a plate, and she said no. \nI brought her a plate of what food was left(because if I didn\u2019t she would\u2019ve been upset) this whole time I had 1 mixed drink 2 beers and 2 shots. The time between she left and the time that I walked home was about 30mins. \n\nAfter coming home she refused to let me take our son so she could do whatever it is she wanted to do because she said that I was too drunk to care for our son all night. I admit I was on  the tipsy side, but was far from drunk. \n\nShe was mad that I came home later than her, and told me to go away. That she didn\u2019t want to be around me.\n\nSo I did exactly that. I went into the garage and continued building and finishing the clothes rack for our son. Then the neighbors invited me to play darts in the garage(we only played 2 games and we share an adjoining garage wall)\n\nMy wife said she was locking the house up for the night so she could sleep, I told her I was in the garage and to not lock the garage door. \n\nShe locked the house completely even though I said not to. Only after an hour of questioning why she locked the garage door and why she was REALLY upset with me did she come unlock the door. \n\nAITA for doing exactly what she said by leaving her alone?\n\nEdit: we came home about 730-8 she wasn\u2019t intending on going to bed prior to 10pm. So she didn\u2019t expect me to take care of the baby alone until at least after 10pm\n\nEdit 2: normally the agreement is I take care of the baby from 10pm-3am and she covers 330am-730-8am. I was offering to care for the baby the entirety of the night(which meant I slept zero hours because I sleep so heavily I don\u2019t hear the baby when he wakes up)\n\nEdit: the party was not next door. The party was across the street and a house down. I was in my garage(that shares an adjoining garage wall) with a different neighbor playing darts.

You got caught up in the moment, and your wife could've reminded you of your deal at any point to ensure her evening remained intact. Try to be more responsible moving forward, but also create a space where she can be honest in communicating moving forward, especially if somehow your end of the bargain got dropped. \n\nAlso, the road to hell was paved with good intentions..

Not because I'm mad he had a good time and not because I don't trust him, but because babies are unpredictable and can fall off things and hurt themselves VERY EASILY. She has every right to be mad, maybe not lock you out the house mad but mad enough to make you sleep on th couch. And to those who want to say that, im not a mother, so I don't know. I may not have birthed a child yet but I can assure you I'd kill for my little nephews and nieces, I would give my life for them and I have been there from start to Finish at all births and have helped my sister in laws with diapers and waking up in the night, with formula and baths I buy for these baby's and dress them.

She said to stay and have food before coming to gey the baby, and you had enough alcohol that you wouldn't be allowed to drive. If you would drive with that blood alcohol level, why would you take care of an infant? All of those things combined are why she's in such a bad mood with you, and rightly so. I think you should go and apologise, listen to her, have a conversation, and try to understand exactly where she feels you went wrong. But mostly, you should apologise and make it up to her. Especially because (if I'm reading this right), she probably got less rest than she would on a usual day from you going to the garage and leaving her in the house.\nI know she said to do that, but leaving for a long enough time that she was already in bed when you stopped?

That must be the case, as you are arguing semantics instead of recognizing that you messed up, apologizing, and taking responsibility for it. \"But I did a thing\" is not an apology. \"I'm a victim too\" is not an apology. \"I only did XYZ\" is not an apology. \n\nI'm going to assume you care about your wife more than being technically right about details that don't matter.
