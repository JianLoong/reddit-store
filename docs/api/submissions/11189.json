He had two kids from his relationship with Emma. My stepson is 15 and my stepdaughter is 14. Mike and I have 3 kids together, Theodore, Isabelle and Matilda. My stepkids names are names more out there and more rare, so I won't mention them exactly but they are word-nature style names. Very modern too. There is a bit of a contrast between my stepkids and bio kids names. But my husband and I chose names we loved for our kids, that we figured would age well with them and my husband was so glad to have input because Emma chose my stepkids names.\n\nI remember when we first brought our oldest home my stepson made an eww comment about his name, but I was so distracted with the baby. My husband spoke to him and told me later that he found the name so different from his and reacted badly.\n\nUp and down I remember some comments being made by my stepkids about their siblings names but I always tried my best to not let it get to my kids. Recently Mike and I learned that Emma and my stepkids have been calling the kids names boring, dull, ugly, saying they were suckered with bad names and their Emma telling her kids how unfortunate my kids are and how lucky they are that she named them. Two of our three kids have taken to heart that their siblings don't like their names and one of my kids said Emma tried to give them a nickname that was better than their real name. My husband was furious when he learned this. He went to speak to Emma but she brushed him off. He told my stepkids they were not to insult the names of their siblings, not to their faces, but not even behind their backs because it was mean. My stepkids said they were glad I hadn't named them because \"they'd rather die than be stuck ugly old names\".\n\nA few days ago I saw Emma while I was grocery shopping. The night before my stepkids had told my husband they and their mom were still talking badly about the kids names and I was still mad. So I went up to Emma and told her to stop talking badly about my kids names to my stepkids, that it was something only a bully would do and she should be better than that. And that I was not okay with her hurting my kids. She was furious and told me I had no right to speak to her and Mike is the only one who could talk to her about my stepkids. She sent Mike a text relaying the same.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677660807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eyu02/aita_for_telling_the_mother_of_my_stepkids_that/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But do ask your husband to follow up,   as Emily won\u2019t have any excuses not to talk with him.  Given the age of your step kids, your husband will have better luck dealing directly with them rather than their mother.  The issue is one of treating everyone with kindness, and dad making it clear he won\u2019t tolerate any mistreatment by any of his children toward anyone.  He needs to have consistent and clear consequences each and every time, while also talking with his children about both the harm the older ones are doing while exploring why they are being purposefully cruel.

It seems their mother has failed to teach them manners.  I think your mistake here was to address Emma yourself\u2014not because it is wrong to speak to the mother of your stepchildren, but because you already know she is unreasonable and nasty.  Your husband needs to do this (again) and keep doing it until Pebbledash and Moccasin\u2014*his* children\u2014learn to behave decently.

Sure, communication about the step-kids should go through your husband. But this is affecting *your* children. You had every right to defend them to a bully - whether it be to a stranger, or Emma.

Your children are being bullied in their own home, by their siblings - and their mother is the one promoting it.  I\u2019m not sure how/the correct way to resolve this, but it cannot continue.

So insulting Theodore, Isabelle and Matilda as boring name is the same as insinuating that Emma is just as boring as well.", "NTA.

She is comparing herself to you and putting down your children\u2019s names as a diss to your family with her ex-husband. That\u2019s extremely immature and unhealthy.

DO NOT do this, this is bad parenting and leads to issues between siblings, especially when one set are teens and one set are little children barely older than toddlers. This is a shortcut to bullying, resentment and lies.\n\nAt this stage, I'd police them 100%. The younger kids are still so young that you have to keep an eye on them in any case ALL the time, so when Older Kids are around, YOU should be around the littlies so you can hear and react to every. word. said. between. all. of. them.\n\nThey should NOT be left alone with each other. Like I said,t he little ones are so little that they need 100% supervision anyway (I assume, but even if they're 10, 11, I'd still argue it's appropriate to watch them 100% with the teens), but for some reason they seem to have TONS of unsupervised alone time with the teens., and THAT is a problem.

Their loss. Bring in close family and friends to reassure that majority of them have no issues with their name perhaps? Positive reinforcement :D  \n\n\nEdit: I really mean it when I say Theodore, Isabella and Matilda are lovely names.", "You\u2019d probably be better off pivoting the conversation away from the names and opinions on names. Instead focus on the behaviour. What makes a good name is subjective, if they are bullying is not subjective. \n\nEg. What kind of person bullies a child about something they can\u2019t change or didn\u2019t decide on their own? What kind of teenager bullies a child? Is this the person they want to be? \n\nP.S. their mother is an AH, what adult makes fun of a child.", "If she's going to approach her in the supermarket, then the goal should be conversation instead of the confrontation.  Don't do that in a public place.  It's awkward and no one is going to respond well with being verbally attacked like that", "I guess it depends how old your kids are.

They are learning this in the other home and hopefully not in the OPs.   \n\n\nThe problem is when you punish Moon and Donkey they will cry foul and that the Evil StepMother of Doom is favour giving to her own children\u2026 and when the little kids find out that they can say Twig and Leaf called them names and get them in trouble they\u2019ll use that.   \n\n\nSo my suggestion was to make it that its one in, all in.  Then Dolphin can remind Shark not to be an idiot about name calling, and if the little kids work out that wifi relies on no made up dobbing they will not resort to this. The punishment for ALL the kids means that there\u2019s less chance of someone lying to get someone else in trouble (and more chance of witnesses helping sort it out), less division of nature vs classic, and they all learn to not be nasty to each other.  Blended families are complex and need discipline that unites the kids, not divides them.", "Thank you for the kindness. I do try to reassure my kids and extended family have as well. I imagine the battle is a little harder to win when they know their siblings have come out so strongly against their names.

I never want anyone to hate their name and hate that people can be so cruel about the names other people have.", "Yeah. These kids sound like they are learning to sit and gossip about other people (in unpleasant ways).   \nIt\u2019s a behaviour that\u2019s unnecessary and unhelpful.   \nPoint out to them that talking about other people is a sign of low mental agility, and that talking about concepts and ideas is where bright kids like them (even if not entirely true give them a little chunk of gold) shine.

OP can only deal with what's going on in her own house. And while I get what you're saying, disciplining a 15 year old the same way she disciplines her 5 year old isn't fair or equitable.
