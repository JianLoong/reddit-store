I have a 2 hour lecture I'd have to miss to attend this in person, and travel ~8 hours to there and back - not enough to majorly inconvenience me, but I'd be missing a day or two of my studies and personal time for it.\n\nBrenda isn't exactly well-liked by half the family either, and clearly doesn't like me. Hell, my Dad even told me when I was young Brenda would ask why I had to be born/even exist.\n\nWhen we grew up in primary school I tried to speak with her and she always treated me like garbage & would joke about me in front of her friends, and would ignore me at home.\n \nIn secondary, I ended up going to an upper end school after performing well on an exam, and it only got worse. Sure, we had 1-2 in-jokes from the early school, but it was clear I was trying to foster a relationship that wasn't there, so I gave up. \n\nThere's only been tense moments since, usually her overblowing something out of proportion, then crying to dodge the blame. Note that my Mom always gives her better treatment/never blames her and rarely makes her take accountability, probably because Brenda views herself as the outsider despite us being raised the same, and her getting way more from my parents materially than me. She barely respects my Dad, spreading any arguments to neighbours, always begging him to buy dresses/clothes when she has no job, and when he declines she'll ask my Mom because my Mom will ask my Dad for 'money' which he'll give (lots to unpack there, but that's another story).\n\nAdditionally, there was a time she completely screwed my trust. My parents are major conspiracy theorists in general and are against vaccines, but I chose to get vaccinated. \n\nBut Brenda asked me about the process of getting the vaccine, making me think she was starting to form her own opinions. Then she went and told my parents I got jabbed, showing the screenshots of our texts, making me come up with a convoluted lie to defend myself on the spot. \n\nFast forward, I go to University after failing a year or two of sixth form and start doing really well. She signs up after I tell my results to my parents, and relies on my Dad for help for almost everything throughout her degree - with him even telling me she's barely earned it, despite her somehow getting an ego and saying she \"should've got a 1st\" when she could barely form a sentence at the start. The degree is in pre-school teaching.\n\nI have no respect for her because she's incapable of taking accountability and is clearly just mooching off my parents, has a history of demanding independence and yet relies on them every step of the way. She treats me like garbage so I don't want to go to her graduation and I certainly don't want her at mine. My Dad says to do it because it'll be the last two events we do as a 'family' with my Masters being separate, but I don't want to see her face at my Bachelors. It's not my family's event, it's mine - even if I force myself to go to hers.
