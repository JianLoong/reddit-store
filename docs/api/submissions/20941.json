Without asking you beforehand? And got mad when you said no? And your family said YOU'RE the asshole?\n\nGod damn it. You're so NTA and SO VERY PATIENT. I would have told them to fuck off. They're so entitled lmao, it's their wedding, why would you pay for it? Good thing you went NC with everyone since they're using you for your money.\n\nInfo tho: did the others paid for the wedding too? Your parents, and the groom's parents too? Or were you the only cash cow around? \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so shocked at the entitlement, that they expected you to pay for the VENUE! If it was your own dress or something, it would have been okay.Your family were just using you for money.\n\n I'm sure the wedding would have been another opportunity for them to pile on and put you down, so it's good you didn't go. \n\nCongrats on all of your success and I hope you'll get some peace now that you've moved.", "NTA\n\nI guess they found a way to pay for the wedding without you. \n\nI\u2019d love to know any of their reasons as to why you should be paying for her wedding.", "NTA, what you did was mature, your sister and her now husband need to get their bread up if they were gonna get married without being able to fund their OWN WEDDING. crazy how entitled people are to someone else\u2019s belongings.", "NTA, but all your family sure is.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t show up, either. I might send my mother a message of some sort with a quick run down of what just occurred. That talk of finances for the event should have happened at the very beginning of planning with expectations that no financial assistance would be received. Anything afterward should then be treated as a generous gift.", "There's a whole shit-load of 'rules' around weddings, all invented out of nothing at all by the wedding-industrial complex which have been disseminated in recent decades via bridal magazines. These come with totally spurious claims that they are 'traditional\". Hint: they're not. *Some marketer just made them up.* They're all designed to upsell wedding shit, and they often accomplish this by separating the decision-maker (the bride) from the person who gets stuck with the bill for those decisions. Yours is a perfect example. Others include destination weddings, which the bride chooses the location of, and all the guests have to pay for. Unmentioned in the invites is the fact that if the bride brings enough ~~guests~~ suckers, the bridal suite gets comped, so the guests are in effect funding the honeymoon.\n\nSo you are absolutely correct: your sister chose you as MOH for your ability to pay for a wedding she couldn't afford. This is a strategy designed by and encouraged in bridal magazines, again for the purposes of upselling. You have every right to feel ambushed and exploited by your sister. That's exactly what was happening. Also, it is very likely that others of your relatives knew exactly what was happening, and encouraged Kara to hold the belief that paying for this wedding was your obligation. Matt's mom, for certain, and your own parents quite likely. NTA.", "NTA this is insane and entitled of them. It sounds like none of them are high earners and expected to mooch off someone who is. You shouldn\u2019t have to move, especially if it impacted your job. Props to you for making 6 figures at 22, I\u2019m literally 32 and don\u2019t make that much. If they continue harassing you, I recommend you threaten legal action, the threat along should ward them off.", "Did they explicitly ask you to help pay?  If they didn't, then NTA", "NTA\nTheir assumption that you'd fund their wedding was entitled and insulting.", "NTA, what you do with your money is your choice. Leaving to give everyone a bit of space is the best thing, I can possibly think of. \n\nJust imaging the drama if this was brought up at the wedding itself gives me a stress migraine.", "NTA. Being a MOH means standing up for your sister/friend at a wedding but it doesn\u2019t mean you get saddled with paying for the entire wedding.   Also, not the best in ambushing you when you thought it was about her birthday. \n\nPlus, you already got her a nice (birthday) cake. She can get and pay for her own wedding cake.", "So you have a house you own, and you're just going to move 5 hours away. That seems pretty easy.", "OP, you need to understand that decisions about this wedding have been being made for *months*, by multiple people in your and Matt's family, including your closest relatives, all in the expectation that you would be the one paying for it, and *no one bothered to inform you*. \n\nIn fact, a conspiracy of silence was engaged in, with people actively keeping you in the dark so that this fait accompli could be sprung on you at just the right moment. When, they hoped, things would be too far along and you too committed to refuse. Literally *everyone* but you knew. And no one warned you.\n\nThe lost that bet, and they seem likely to have lost a daughter, a sister, and a potential benefactor going forward.

Walking out is not constructive (but understandable if too angry to have a constructive conversation.) but then doubling down with the only thing you say is \u201cI\u2019m out\u201d is particularly poor communication.
