FOR PRIVACY)-%\n\nMy sister Kara (24F) and her fianc\u00e9 Matt (26M) are getting married. My sister Kara asked me to be her maid of honor, of course I said yes, (I\u2019m 22F unmarried) and was very exited, she involved me in a lot of planning like helping to choose her cake, dress ect. As the wedding is getting closer Matt asks me if I want to surprise Kara with a birthday cake, as her birthday was before the wedding, I decided I\u2019d help, as it would be very nice. I soon stopped over at their apartment, as I walked in a saw the wedding planner, Kara and Matt all sitting in the living room. I was confused as Matt had told me Kara was gone, Kara stood up and waved me over, as if she knew I was coming. Matt looks at me blankly and the wedding planner stays silent. I walked in following their waves and asked something like \u201cwhat are we doing here?\u201d Kara replied something along the lines of \u201chelping us of course.\u201d I sat with them for a little bit before Kara broke the silence and said, \u201cDanni (me) your paying for the venue, cake\u2026\u201d it went on an on, I was shocked and stunned they were asking me to pay, finally Kara ended her list and told me the total- my face dropped, at that point I felt as though they\u2019d crossed a line so I looked at them and walked out. (For context I make 6 figures) I was very angry that they were using me for my money, I texted Kara and Matt \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to find another maid of honor.\u201d \n\nFast forward an hour, and I\u2019m being bombarded with texts, emails, calls, ect. My sister and my parents are mad at me!!! Because I said I wouldn\u2019t pay- for their wedding!! At that point I was fed up with all of this, so instead of going to my house (yes I have a house at 22) and being bombarded, so I booked a hotel room about an hour away, as I drove up to my hotel, Matt\u2019s mom- MATTS MOM!!! She calls me and leaves a message about how I walked out on them, it was really nasty so I\u2019ll spare the details.\n\nFast forward to their wedding day, I choose not to show up altogether as I had been blatantly disregarded, again I was spammed with very mean messages and texts, from anyone and everyone I knew. From that day until now I have blatantly ignored all of there calls texts, knocks on my door- you name it they\u2019ve done it. I\u2019m so fed up with this that I\u2019ve decided to move away, about 5 hours in the car.

Without asking you beforehand? And got mad when you said no? And your family said YOU'RE the asshole?\n\nGod damn it. You're so NTA and SO VERY PATIENT. I would have told them to fuck off. They're so entitled lmao, it's their wedding, why would you pay for it? Good thing you went NC with everyone since they're using you for your money.\n\nInfo tho: did the others paid for the wedding too? Your parents, and the groom's parents too? Or were you the only cash cow around? \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so shocked at the entitlement, that they expected you to pay for the VENUE! If it was your own dress or something, it would have been okay.Your family were just using you for money.\n\n I'm sure the wedding would have been another opportunity for them to pile on and put you down, so it's good you didn't go. \n\nCongrats on all of your success and I hope you'll get some peace now that you've moved.", "NTA\n\nI guess they found a way to pay for the wedding without you. \n\nI\u2019d love to know any of their reasons as to why you should be paying for her wedding.", "NTA, what you did was mature, your sister and her now husband need to get their bread up if they were gonna get married without being able to fund their OWN WEDDING. crazy how entitled people are to someone else\u2019s belongings.", "NTA, but all your family sure is.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t show up, either. I might send my mother a message of some sort with a quick run down of what just occurred. That talk of finances for the event should have happened at the very beginning of planning with expectations that no financial assistance would be received. Anything afterward should then be treated as a generous gift.", "There's a whole shit-load of 'rules' around weddings, all invented out of nothing at all by the wedding-industrial complex which have been disseminated in recent decades via bridal magazines. These come with totally spurious claims that they are 'traditional\". Hint: they're not. *Some marketer just made them up.* They're all designed to upsell wedding shit, and they often accomplish this by separating the decision-maker (the bride) from the person who gets stuck with the bill for those decisions. Yours is a perfect example. Others include destination weddings, which the bride chooses the location of, and all the guests have to pay for. Unmentioned in the invites is the fact that if the bride brings enough ~~guests~~ suckers, the bridal suite gets comped, so the guests are in effect funding the honeymoon.\n\nSo you are absolutely correct: your sister chose you as MOH for your ability to pay for a wedding she couldn't afford. This is a strategy designed by and encouraged in bridal magazines, again for the purposes of upselling. You have every right to feel ambushed and exploited by your sister. That's exactly what was happening. Also, it is very likely that others of your relatives knew exactly what was happening, and encouraged Kara to hold the belief that paying for this wedding was your obligation. Matt's mom, for certain, and your own parents quite likely. NTA.", "NTA this is insane and entitled of them. It sounds like none of them are high earners and expected to mooch off someone who is. You shouldn\u2019t have to move, especially if it impacted your job. Props to you for making 6 figures at 22, I\u2019m literally 32 and don\u2019t make that much. If they continue harassing you, I recommend you threaten legal action, the threat along should ward them off.", "Did they explicitly ask you to help pay?  If they didn't, then NTA", "NTA\nTheir assumption that you'd fund their wedding was entitled and insulting.", "NTA, what you do with your money is your choice. Leaving to give everyone a bit of space is the best thing, I can possibly think of. \n\nJust imaging the drama if this was brought up at the wedding itself gives me a stress migraine.", "NTA. Being a MOH means standing up for your sister/friend at a wedding but it doesn\u2019t mean you get saddled with paying for the entire wedding.   Also, not the best in ambushing you when you thought it was about her birthday. \n\nPlus, you already got her a nice (birthday) cake. She can get and pay for her own wedding cake.", "So you have a house you own, and you're just going to move 5 hours away. That seems pretty easy.", "OP, you need to understand that decisions about this wedding have been being made for *months*, by multiple people in your and Matt's family, including your closest relatives, all in the expectation that you would be the one paying for it, and *no one bothered to inform you*. \n\nIn fact, a conspiracy of silence was engaged in, with people actively keeping you in the dark so that this fait accompli could be sprung on you at just the right moment. When, they hoped, things would be too far along and you too committed to refuse. Literally *everyone* but you knew. And no one warned you.\n\nThe lost that bet, and they seem likely to have lost a daughter, a sister, and a potential benefactor going forward. All out of greed, narcissism, and duplicity.", "Sorry, but I don't believe this post. Feels made up.", "So, you are a hedge fund trader at 22, but seem to have a lot of time to post on reddit in the last 3 days, including starting your own sub reddit. \n\nYou don't seem to be putting in the hours to be very successful. This almost sounds like you are Anna Kendrick's character from Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.", "This sounds pretend but, hey! NTA for refusing to pay as you were never asked. YTA for everything else.", "NTA: your sister should have never asked/demanded this. And the ambush way they did it: particularly awful and weird.\n\n\nYTA: for reacting by walking out, quitting the wedding and ghosting everyone long-term.\n\nI think a better response would have been to say \u201cno.\u201d And that your were very offended that they expected this. Walking out is not constructive (but understandable if too angry to have a constructive conversation.) but then doubling down with the only thing you say is \u201cI\u2019m out\u201d is particularly poor communication.  Walking out of someone\u2019s life for one (admittedly large) slight is pretty extreme.\n\nYou had the opportunity to be the bigger person here, but went nuclear. \n\nEdit: replaced accidentally deleted sentence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
