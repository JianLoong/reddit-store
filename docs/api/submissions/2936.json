She spoke with our eldest sister and they decided to split the expenses 3 ways between us. Host sister is known to be stingy with her money outside her immediate family. To not ruffle any feathers I agreed. Keep in mind, myself and our eldest sister have hosted turkey day and incurred all expenses without anyone chipping in. So I was budgeting to chip in about $100 max. In the past Ive hosted, with the same number of people (15+) Ive spent about $250. I didn\u2019t skimp on the amount of food or quality ingredients, I bought truffle butter from a specialty store FFS. My sisters went grocery shopping for all the foods. That night host sister texted me that she added up all receipts and it came out to $250 each. I sincerely thought this was a mistake and asked if it was $250 divided by the 3 siblings. She replied no. It is $250 per sibling. I was gobsmacked. I was incredulous, angry, and asking myself what on gods earth did they buy? So after a little while of going through all the stages of grief I called our youngest sister who tagged along for the grocery shopping. Side note : youngest sister just lost her job and is currently job hunting. She has also hosted turkey day before, incurring all expenses. She already knew why I was calling. She said our host sister basically tripled up on everything. Triple turkeys, triple amount of sides (corn, green beans, potatoes, bread, milk, drinks, alcohol etc\u2026) She kept telling them it was too much. She said our niece, 23yo, daughter of host sister was also throwing in \u201cday of\u201d snacks. Obscene amount of chips, dips, cookies, ice cream, cakes. This is in addition to the all the pies they purchased. They went to checkout and she kept telling them \u201chey the total keeps going up, don\u2019t you think we should cut back on some stuff?\u201d Host sister said no. The kicker to all of this is, our eldest sister was somehow roped into paying for the grocery haul. So in essence I don\u2019t even owe the money to host sister, I owe our eldest sister. After the call I call host sister. In the most even tempered princess voice (host sister is known to have her feelings easily hurt, quick to get defensive and can hold onto a grudge for ages) I ask about the expenses. She said that things are expensive and it is what it is. So I asked if I could see the receipts. She immediately gets defensive, says not to chip in any money and says she cant wait to see me on Turkey day (sarcastically) and abruptly hangs up. I try calling, no answer. Call my nieces to ask for their mother and they say shes busy. So Ive decided just to give the money to eldest sister and call it a day. I know when I show up shes going to be giving me the cold shoulder, make passive aggressive comments and stank faces.

And she refused to show the receipts, told you not to pay, and hung up on you - that\u2019s not the behavior of someone who\u2019s on the up and up. I can see her being annoyed at the perceived accusation if she was genuinely only buying a reasonable amount of food, but honest people don\u2019t have anything to hide.\n\nAlso, your plan to give the sister WHO ACTUALLY  PAID the money is the right thing to do.

Don't be a sap and pay to fill her freezer and pantry.  Don't give the host sister any money.  Give your eldest sister $100 for your share of the food that will be served at Thanksgiving dinner.

Pay the money, say whatever you have to say, and never, ever, ever split anything or engage in any monetary or logistical endeavors with her again.\n\nLearn from this - sister is an immature doofus. Be weary. She will be hot mess in all things, all the time. If it happens again, then yes, you would be the asshole because you will have ascribed sense to someone who has none. Further, she seems to have a touch of greed.\n\np.s. I've never heard of anyone having 3 turkeys at Thanksgiving.
