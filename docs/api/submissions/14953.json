She had been battling her addiction for the past 3 years now. We're all so proud of her, and we tell her that she is winning the \"war on alcohol\"! \n\nWith that being said, while my girlfriend does not drink at all anymore, I (27M) have noticed that her appetite has increased. Also, she literally drinks 2 litres of Coke (not the white stuff lol) every day. By my own estimation, she has put on about 5 lbs of weight over the past month. So I like to take the piss out of her when I can, and tell her things like \"this jacket makes you look bulging as fuck\" or joking to our friends about how she is a \"glutton\". \n\nI'd just like to say that my girlfriend has never actually been fat. She works out every day, and she's always been slim and attractive. She has never even close to being in danger of being overweight. This is why I kept making fun of her weight gain, because hopefully she would know that everything I say is BS and that I'm just joking.\n\nThe last time I cracked jokes about her weight gain was when I was texting her one night. I suggested going to a popular all-you-can-eat buffet sometime, and then I asked her \"are you sure you can handle yourself though?\" She texted back, straight-up telling me that she won't go anywhere with me anymore if I keep messing around with her. I tried letting her know that I was just joking, but she said that \"jokes are supposed to be funny\". We're still together, but I have ceased talking about her weight.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681659773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12oe1mw/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_girlfriends_slight/", "score": 456, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She gains weight for laying off drinking for sobriety sake you knock her for her weight gain from that effort?

No excuse to be so abusive to someone in recovery. Are you still drinking? Because it sounds like you are trying to sabotage her sobriety", "YTA, joking about someone\u2019s weight shouldn\u2019t even be a thing. Your girlfriend has overcome this addiction and yes she may have increased eating while\nDoing so but as you said yourself she\u2019s not \u201cfat\u201d and she works out.

I must be dense because I don't see any jokes here.", "YTA and it's sad that you couldn't realize that on your own. You NEVER comment on someone's body unless they asked for the comment.

You\u2019re clearly  brain dead too if you even have to ask this. Hope she breaks up with you", "YTA. Just because its obvious to you that she's not fat doesnt mean that she doesnt see herself as being fat. Just being a little heavier than they were last year can be enough to make someone feel fat, even if they are still (relatively) very thin.  For example, people with anorexia can be in the bottom 1% for weight, and still view themselves as fat. It's not for you to decide what constitutes 'fat' in someone else's view. You say she has gained weight, which she must have already noticed  herself, even without you making frequent remarks about it. It is good to hear you have stopped, in light of her apparent dislike of the comments, but I suggest you apologise more properly too and try to reach an understanding with her about it in order to fully heal your relationship going forward, as the persistence of this unsolved issue will only hurt you in the long run.", "Not the AH, just joking you are a gigantic AH.\n\nBig YTA", "YTA, and it's odd that you don't get it but also seem to already know you are.", "YTA.

Her opinion is the only one that matters on the subject.", "YTA She's gonna lose so much weight when she dumps you.", "YTA.  You aren't joking, you are abusive.

Even if you could tell why would you ever tease someone about that?

I finally snapped after he commented that I still looked pregnant after a c-section. Yta, nobody likes being told they look overweight, and every woman on the planet gains and loses about 2-5 pounds a month depending on how close you are to menstruation. It's almost like you're trying to shame her into an eating disorder or relapse, like do her a favor and get your toxic ass away from her and her sobriety.", "INFO: what makes those jokes funny? Can you explain? \n\nYeah, thought so. YTA\n\nAlso, sobriety is complicated and leaves you vulnerable. Taking advantage of this is cruel.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is right--jokes about weight are never funny.", "You know YTA. I hope she leaves you. Then you can tell your BS 'jokes' to the wall.", "Seriously dude?\n\nOf course YTA. You don't make jokes about people's weight, period. ESPECIALLY someone whom you profess to love and support in other ways.\n\nYou're also missing a crucial point, which is that she may be substituting food now that she can't use alcohol to cope. She needs to be seeing a therapist to help address whatever underlying issue(s) led her to addiction in the first place. If you truly want to support her, you'll stop making cruel jokes about her weight and start helping her find a path to real recovery, not just sobriety.\n\nDo better.", "YTA majorly. She\u2019s only been a sober a month and sometimes people can use food or caffeinated drinks as a substitute during the first few months. She\u2019s also detoxing and trying her best to resist, you making fun of her weight is the last thing she needs. I get looking after her well being and if it becomes a problem where she\u2019s eating constantly, then you can step in, but not while she\u2019s in this state.", "She should drop the extra 200-ishlbs in her life.  Meaning you.  Definitely YTA.", "YTA and let's be honest, you weren't joking.   You know it's not funny to her, and you know (or should know) that weight gain is common in the early stages of sobriety.   And \"war on alcohol\"?   That sounds sarcastic and minimizing her struggle.", "Even if she wasn\u2019t in early sobriety YTA. But that adds a whole extra layer of assholery to it.\n\n1. As a fellow recovering alcoholic, getting sober is one of the hardest things anyone can do. The fact that she has a month is absolutely incredible and that is what you should be focusing on. It\u2019s extremely common in early sobriety for people to get sugar cravings and eat more treats- at times it can stave off cravings from their substance of choice. She may have gained *gasp* a whopping FIVE POUNDS but those 5 pounds likely are protecting her sobriety in some way. And she\u2019s a million times healthier than she was in active alcoholism.\n\n2. You don\u2019t make fun of your partner for gaining weight. I feel like that is just universally understood. People\u2019s bodies (particularly women) are subject to so much ridiculous scrutiny already, she doesn\u2019t need anyone - let alone her boyfriend - to pile it on. And ESPECIALLY during what I\u2019m sure has been a very challenging and emotionally raw time for her.\n\n3. If she says it\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s not funny. Period. It\u2019s good you stopped commenting on her weight, but you owe her a massive amends as well.\n\nI\u2019m sure she would much rather your continued support and encouragement rather than \u201cjokes\u201d at her expense. If your goal is to make her smile, you\u2019re way off the mark.", "YTA and I didn\u2019t even have to read your whole post. The title gave away that you\u2019re the worst kind of asshole. Hope she dumps you and moves on to someone who deserves her.", "YTA- it\u2019s very typical to gain weight after giving up alcohol. She probably craves sweets like never before. Already a struggle enough to stay sober and has to hear your stupid jokes, Nice.", "YTA. What a dick. If I gained 5 pounds and my bf called me a \"glutton\" I'd tell him to go fuck himself. \n\nShe probably recognizes she's gained weight and doesn't need you to keep pouring salt in the wound. Or, she hasn't noticed it, and you keep calling her fat!\n\nYou're being a dick my dude.", "INFO: The fuck?", "YTA, dude. Your \u201cjokes\u201d aren\u2019t funny, they\u2019re just mean. And a lot of newly sober people have sugar cravings - the body converts alcohol to sugar, so it\u2019s an incredibly common thing that usually passes in time. And alcohol has a lot of calories, so eating more in general isn\u2019t uncommon in early sobriety. \n\nHonestly, this comes off as you trying to sabotage her sobriety because of your own insecurity. Connecting the weight gain with her sobriety and then nitpicking her about it isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to help her stay sober long-term. \n\nIf you want to help, start having healthier snacks around the house, maybe pick up a case or two of la croix, which can be a good alternative to drinking alcohol or soda - don\u2019t point these things out to her, just have them. And then shut the fuck up about anything to do with her that isn\u2019t supportive.", "YTA, there are two things you do not mention to any women or even your SO. Those two things are weight and age. it never ends well for us guys if we make comments on stuff like that. it can either end up like something minor as sleeping on the couch or blowing up your whole relationship. from now on, just call her gorgeous and hope she doesn't hold resentment for those jokes.", "YTA\n\nAnd I really don\u2019t even get what\u2019s funny about this \u201cjoke\u201d?

She's going through a very hard time, and you're \"making jokes\" about something stress inducing and unrelated.", "wtf dude? Is this even real? How can you not know you're the asshole?\n\n5lb is nothing and it's normal for weight to fluctuate by that much on virtually a daily level\n\nShe is trying to stay SOBER and has been struggling with it for ages and finally achieved it and you undermine her like this?\n\n\"Jokes\" about people's appearance are never funny never mind about weight.

I was skinny pre pregnancy, smoking, smoking weed, taking multiple medications for different things. Found out I was pregnant and stopped everything, had the baby and didn't really put on much weight until after. Now I am 3 clothing sizes bigger. Whenever I make negative comments about my weight, my partner gets upset and tells me how beautiful and sexy he finds me. He hates hearing me talk shit about myself and it gives me confidence. If I was back on medications and smoking weed, I would lose the weight but I don't want to go back to bad vices to be skinny. I can't explain how much positive comments from my loved one means to me when I feel shit about myself. Your girlfriend is sober after a struggle with an addiction and you think taking the piss out of her slight weight gain is acceptable? Are you trying to push her back to booze? You say she is not overweight, which doesn't make a difference, disgusting comments either way, but why the need to comment at all?

So I like to take the piss out of her when I can, and tell her things like \"this jacket makes you look bulging as fuck\" or joking to our friends about how she is a \"glutton\". \n\nI'd just like to say that my girlfriend has never actually been fat. She works out every day, and she's always been slim and attractive. She has never even close to being in danger of being overweight. This is why I kept making fun of her weight gain, because hopefully she would know that everything I say is BS and that I'm just joking.\n\nThe last time I cracked jokes about her weight gain was when I was texting her one night. I suggested going to a popular all-you-can-eat buffet sometime, and then I asked her \"are you sure you can handle yourself though?\" She texted back, straight-up telling me that she won't go anywhere with me anymore if I keep messing around with her.

YTA", "We all? Was there some kind of group discussion about her body?", "That doesn\u2019t really matter though. You said it yourself she\u2019s a healthy weight and works out. Just bc she\u2019s gaining weight doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily fat, it\u2019s most likely muscle if anything.", "YTA you human wet sock.  I hope you get dumped for the rest of your life.", "I laughed - at the punch :)", "Now that's the kind of punchline \"jokers\" like this deserve!", "I know right! Title alone screams AH but it was so much worse!", "It would be horrible to make these '''''jokes''''' to anyone, let alone to someone who's going through something that's very, very hard to do and who must not be in the best mental place. OP, YTA. ETA: for those who, as me, use kilograms and not pounds, 5lb is around 2.2kg.", "I came to say the exact same thing. \nLike OP did you READ the title on your post?", "Right? \n\n\"My beautidul gf won her life back and now I enjoy taking the piss by telling her how worthless she is now that she's gained 5 pounds.   AITA?\"", "Spotting the difference between those two is half the fun of this place for me.\n\nSometimes it's like \"AITA for shooting my MIL in the face\", but then you go on to find it's halloween, the dead are rising from their graves, and they had to protect their wife & children from zombie MIL.\n\nAnd other times it's like .. JFC, yes YTA, how did you manage to write the title without slapping yourself in the face.\n\nAnd this is the latter.", "Yeah, I thought maybe it was a case where he made one ill advised joke, she didn't laugh and lesson learned. But that's not what happened here at all.", "Right?! Addiction specialists will warn people that they can expect to crave sugar and other junk, and it is best to indulge those cravings for a while. It comes from your body relearning how to regulate. \n\nThis poor girl is doing what she should, and this guy is being horrible to her.", "And for the love of god 5lbs hardly makes someone look like they have piled on weight", "He\u2019s really saying to her \u201cYou\u2019re still not good enough for me and you\u2019ll never do better than me so don\u2019t even think about leaving now that you\u2019re getting your life together\u201d OP is pathetic and transparent AF.", "Often times, alcoholics are also sugar addicts.", "Let's hope so, 'cause yikes!", "Bingo.  She's going to be super paranoid about weight gain now and end up replacing one unhealthy coping mechanism (drinking) with another.  His commentary and her vulnerability as a newly sober person are making her ripe for an eating disorder.", "Active addiction can completely destroy one\u2019s self esteem.  I\u2019m willing to bet OP is very, very insecure, and very, very worried about his girlfriend feeling better about herself now that she\u2019s in recovery.  He needs to keep her down by any means necessary so that she doesn\u2019t realize she can do better and leave him.  This is really pathetic on his part.", "And five pounds is nothing, how did he even notice? I've gained eight or nine in the past few months, only one person said anything out of the three people I spend all my time around", "Substance abuse is often rooted in other issues - insecurities, traumas, depression, etc.  I know from my own issues with drinking that if you're not getting the proper support and mental health care, your \"addiction\" can quickly switch to something else - in my case, an eating disorder.  Alcohol drowned out my insecurities, and they came rearing out when I no longer could drink them away.  This kind of commentary, along with the vulnerability of a recovering addict, is a perfect recipe for an eating disorder. \n\nOP, FYI - anorexia nervosa has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness.  Would you rather your girlfriend drink herself to death or starve herself to death?  Because you don't seem too vested in her being healthy and happy.", "2 litres of coke a day is drinking yourself to death", "The question is why is she with him?", "Perhaps he fears she will realize she is out of his league now that she is sober, so he is trying to put her down before she grows a healthy self-esteem? Or maybe he's always been like this and now she just happens to have a clearer view of it.", "The \u201cnicest\u201d thing he said about her is that she has always been slim & attractive. I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s with her\u2026", "He is absolutely threatened by her sobriety, either because of his own shit relationship with alcohol or because he\u2019s scared that a sober gf won\u2019t be as easy to manipulate. He\u2019s awful and I hope her sponsor helps her to see that", "Or you know, ages.", "Idk. I think she has about ~180-200 lbs she could stand lose.", "[deleted]", "In this case, I'm not sure I would call it \"passive\" aggressive. This is full-blown malice. The tip-off for me is \"I like to take the piss out of her...\"", "I would call it aggressive aggressive", "Asshole spouses hate this one esay trick in losing weight. Doctors are jealous.", "When my partner quit drinking, I could not keep up with the amount of snacks and sugary treats he was going through. Boxes of snacks would disappear in 1-2 days. I never said anything negative, just kept the kitchen stocked and eventually it tapered off", "Oh I agree. I was having a lot of trouble writing and choosing my words to keep from getting banned, lol. I am not shocked I didn\u2019t find the right words.", "Exactly what I was thinking.. he's making it a big point that she's drinking 2 literals of pop a day.  And it feels like he's pointing out her being fatter just to push her over the edge to drink.  So sick and twisted.", "True. So he really just needs to stop with the comments", "I agree.  But a 2L of Coke every day is still concerning.  Do you understand which one the 2L is? It\u2019s the largest bottle of soda one can buy.  The ones at the supermarket.", "Exactly the alcohol messed with their blood sugar levels so now they crave more sugar than they did before. Many sobriety programs will tell you to indulge in more candies because it will help you with recovery. \n\nObviously not forever but one month in is barely any time at all. \n\nYTA and it seems like someone is a little insecure with the self improvement of their partner. \ud83e\udd2b", "quite the punchline.", "Absolutely, couldn\u2019t agree more. I hope the GF has other supportive people in her life to help tune his awful bullying out and celebrate her successes on her journey.\n\nEdit to add: YTA", "How the f do you \"notice\" 2kg of a change? Like, that's not even a gain, that's a normal range of weight movement, some girls may gain that just during their period and then naturally lose it...you must actually be obsessed to notice that little...", "These are insults, not jokes.", "Honestly, it seems as if he doesn\u2019t even like his girlfriend.

Yes, the chips are unhealthy and yes, she has gained weight. But you could ask anybody who knows her, we would much rather her eat the chips than go back to meth", "She just got sober. Now that's she sober, she's probably going to see OP for the toxic jerk that he is, and dump him too. I hope so anyway. YTA, OP.", "If someone is worried about their partner\u2019s health there are a lot better ways to go about expressing their worry than making fun of them and calling them fat. So no, still not acceptable. That\u2019s just gross and abusive.", "\u2026Okay, shut up.", "Yeah I know and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s great but if it\u2019s stopping her from drowning in alcohol I don\u2019t have much of a problem with it", "I doubt he has estimated the weight gain correctly. A lot of these types of men think they are an expert on estimating weight, and they never are. \n\nThat said, it is beside the point. Laughing about someone's weight gain is pretty much never funny.

You think this is a good way to live the rest of her life?", "Seriously, men have 0 idea how the relationship between the number on the scale and a woman's appearance works.

At the time I weighed about 200ish, but I'm tall and the way I'm built, I still had a distinctly hourglass figure and everything. So I asked him \"what about me, would I qualify?\"\n\nHe said \"oh yeah definitely.\"\n\nI then told him my actual weight and watched his jaw hit the floor. I swear I think men just sort of randomly assign arbitrary numbers to their mental image of an \"acceptably attractive woman\" without much regard for reality.", "The hells your problem? Someone gaining fifty pounds doesn\u2019t make them obese, being obese isn\u2019t gross, and even if she was obese does that give her boyfriend the right to verbally abuse her?", "You're not helping anyone with tough hate, you're just being selfish and pathetic", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Obesity isn\u2019t healthy but it\u2019s not gross.", "Seriously? You really think that obese people deserve to be abused?", "[deleted]", "You are also just being a dick. Fat peoples bodies aren\u2019t gross. They\u2019re just bodies."]}
