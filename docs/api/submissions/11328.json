{"id": 11328, "submission_id": "11g9juz", "title": "AITA for refusing to help my mom get back with my dad?", "selftext": " My (15m) parents (43m and 42f) divorced 6 years ago when I was 9. Dad said it was because they were arguing a lot but my brother (18m) told me that he heard what they were arguing about and it was because mom wasn't being a good parent and dad was trying to convince her to be a better mom. She never was a good mom but she wasn't horrible either. She neglected but never abused us physically. She would always tell everyone how her husband was the most important person in her world and even if she lost her kids she would still have the strength to move forward if Dad was still with her. Yes she said this in front of her side of the family and dads side thinking they would agree. They did not and thought she was a bad mom.\n\nI should point out that my dad is the perfect dad/husband and is my hero. He was always there for all of us. He is also handsome, educated, strong, intelligent and a kind person. I think this was the reason that mom was so crazy about him that her obsession was scary.\n\nWhen I was 9 they divorced and I remember before they split for good, mom was screaming and throwing things around the room. I don't remember everything. The therapist said it was the brains defense mechanism. Mom had a full on mental breakdown and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks. My brother (18M) and sister (17f) hated mom and refused to visit. I asked dad if I could visit and he said yes. When we went the lady there said that we weren't allowed to see her because she was unpredictable and was hurting the staff.\n\n2 years later dad got married to Allison (45f) and she came a long with her son (17m) and daughter (20f). She is an incredible woman and for the first time my siblings and I felt like we had a mom. She treated us as her own and never showed and difference between us and her kids. It got to the point where she was also making parenting choices for us which was ok because she always had our best interest in heart. We call her mom and her kids call our dad, dad. We have a perfect family and her kids are our siblings.\n\nMom got out of the ward a few weeks later and it took her years to gather her life back together. I think she regrets how she treated us or it's likely she is upset that treating us the way she did caused her husband to get married to some one else. I still visit her and she is a lot better as a mother now than before. When I say a lot, I mean it is night and day. My siblings rarely see her and it is really starting to get to her.\n\nYesterday mom asked me to help her get back with dad. I said no and that dad is happy. She said that dad would be happier with her and said that dad should be with a prettier woman like her (mom is a lot better looking) instead of a \"Hag\" like Allison.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to help my mom?", "created_utc": 1677780610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g9juz/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_mom_get_back_with_my/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
