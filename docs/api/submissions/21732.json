We had met sophomore year of college. We had so much in common which he stated. We partied super hard and for the sake of reddit I'll just say we were more than friends. I am bisexual and  pretty much always knew. He was closeted until college (or so I thought, apparently he still his to his family). We had many twister parties with several people (if you catch my drift). Anyway, that is the past my friend alluded to in his reddit post. However, we still had many parties of our own until about 3 months ago. This is when we stopped hanging out and now I finally know why. \n\nAs I read in his reddit post he ruined my chances of working in his family company, which doesn't really matter. It was an easy job I thought I could get, but if my friend had just let me know he didn't want me there I wouldn't have ever tried. He told his father I am a drunk and all this other stuff to make sure I didn't get the job. Then in his post he tried to bash me several times. He said he payed off debts of mine, which I never asked him to. He offered as he was very obsessed me with and acted more like a man who wanted to spoil me, as I spoiled him ;)\n\nSo in my AITA moment since I saw the reddit post he made about me calling me \"a terrible drunk\" and \"untrustworthy\" I showed up to his place of work when I knew he wasn't working and show his dad his reddit post. Then I let his dad know that he used to be involved with me and still until recently was. So I did maybe take it too far. But if anyone read his post he was very vile towards me. I don't care that he didn't want me to work at his dad's company, but the way he views me is awful. He hasn't reached out to me and all of our mutual friends have taken my side. I feel awful as I basically cited him to his dad. So AITA?\n\nIf you have seen the reddit post or haven't he titled it as \"AITA for not helping my friend get a job?\" but it was so much more than that....\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688859696, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uj3ba/aita_for_showing_my_exfriends_reddit_post_to_his/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
