My brother\u2019s father is not in his life. \n\nAs a kid, I spent an equal amount of time with both parents but my brother was always with mom.

Or at least acts like he doesn\u2019t. \n\nWell my bf and I decided to go to every one of his games and have been going to every game since last year. He always gets really happy. He even jokingly calls us his parents as we sit with all the other parents. This is something I only do for him.\n\nMy brother had his final volleyball game near the end of October and like always, I was going. \n\nHowever, as I was about to leave, my mom said she needed to talk. Ten minutes later, my dad shows up.

Trust me when I tell you he will always remember it.", "NTA.  You're 22 years old and YOU decide who, what, where, when, why, and how you spend your free time.  If your mom would be a parent, you and your BF wouldn't have to be.", "NTA - did they just forget that he is a child too?", "NTA and you and your BF are really great people for doing this. You mom and dad are being weird about this...", "Just keep saying that this is their fault by not going to his games. Like just keep fucking saying that fuck them. NTA", "Nta. Personally I would make a deal with them and say something like \u201cif you guys actually attend four of brothers games in a row and pretend to be excited for him and act like he actually has parents that are proud of him then I will consider going to one of the girls events. But only if you guys do your part first.\u201d And you know full when they aren\u2019t going too and next time they bring it up just remind them that your waiting on them to act exited to be brothers parents at four of his games.", "Your mom needs to step up as his parent and do her job. The entire reason you start going was because his father jetted him as a kid and your mom doesn't go to his games. Definitely NTA.", " NTA. Your mom is the biggest asshole because she\u2019s leaving her own kid to his own devices. She\u2019s neglected her parental responsibilities and you\u2019ve had to step up. Your sisters have family who support them but your brother only has you. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see your step-dad kick him out at 18, since he has such irrational feeling about \u201canother man\u2019s child\u201d.", "NTA - So it never dawned on them that they're trying to pawn their job onto you? Stick with your gut OP, your brother deserves your support this is the kind of stuff people remember for the rest of their lives especially when he barely has anyone else.", "Look you\u2019re really, really NTA. You\u2019re doing something wonderful for your brother. \nBut I can understand how your sisters might be hurt. Correcting favoritism with more favoritism doesn\u2019t work. The sisters might understand that you\u2019re only doing this for your brother because no one else will, but if they love you and look up to you, it will still sting that you don\u2019t devote as much attention to them. (If that is actually happening and you\u2019re generally close to your sisters. I recognize that your parents might be driving this.)\nDon\u2019t skip your brothers events for them, but maybe do try to find some way to show them that you\u2019re still a part of their support system, too.", "No, you are NTA at all! What you\u2019re doing for your brother is awesome and probably means the world to him. If your mother was a decent person, I\u2019d think she would appreciate you and your boyfriend making up for what your brother is lacking.", "It is very considerate of you to do that for your brother. He needs you. However, your sisters are also your siblings. You can't set aside a few hours to go to a dance recital? I have four little siblings, and I am a full-time college student working two part-time jobs. I do everything I can to be in all four of their lives as often as I can. I can't go to every single game, recital, and concert, but I try to be there for them. \n\nYour parents, however, cornering you and trying to force you to \"choose\" between your siblings was a great ah move. I cannot fathom why they would do that. They should have just had a conversation with you, like adults, about how you choosing favorites affects the rest of your siblings, and makes them feel like you don't care about them. Your sisters are children, they don't understand why you can go to all your brothers games but can't go to any of theirs. So, ESH.", "NTA- well done! Great support", "You are already playing substitute parent for your brother. Tell your parents to come to earth. What comes from the heart should never be demanded as what's due. They can go to all the games their kids participate in. And they shouldn't harass you.\n\nNTA. No way.", "NTA by any means.\n\nIf you are able to, then you should sit down with all the sisters and explain WHY you are there for your brother in a different way.", "NTA You & your brother's mother isn't supporting him & your mother is AH. You are the only one that is supporting him, all your other siblings/stepsiblings have parental support & he only has you. You are a great big sis!", "NTA", "OP you are a goddamn Saint. NTA.\n\nI'd be in prison if someone spoke about my brother that way. You are mature beyond your years and I applaud you for supporting him where nobody else does. Good on ya.", "NTA. \u2018It\u2019s not fair on your sisters\u2019 well none of this is fair on your brother! You\u2019re filling a gap where his parents should be.\nOP\u2019s mom is abandoning her son in favour of her daughters, and should be thanking you profusely for filling in where she is FAILING as a parent.\nOP\u2019s dad has no obligation to the son BUT OP has just as little relation to the step sister as the dad does to the brother.\nYour step sister has both loving parents. Your half sisters have both loving parents. Your brother has NO ONE except you and your bf. Also, can we appreciate the bf for a moment for fulfilling such an important role for a kid out of the kindness of his heart, not even obligation \ud83d\ude0d", "NTA in any way, shape or form. If your mom was being a half way decent parent your brother would already have someone there for him. You're not playing favorites, you're balancing things out.\n\nKeep being there for your brother. He needs someone in his court and it might become even more important when he turns 18.", "Your act of kindness is a glaring spot light on your parents' dark dark hearts. If WE can see the logic of your love and devotion towards your brother, it shouldn't be a stretch for them to do the same. NTA", "NTA. You are an adult. You don't need your parents anymore. Tell them if they have done their fucking job as the parents you wouldn't have needed to step up. I suggest start going LC on them because they are obviously toxic people.", "I am so happy you are together. I was going to say that when he goes NC with your family let him move in with you.", "NAH, well Mom kinda is but not for this. Their other kids voiced there feelings as they should. The parents addressed that with you as parents of kids who were hurt as they should. You are trying to let your brother know he has someone there and From the sounds still make an effort to go to the bigger moments in your sisters lives. The only thing I would do is possibly sit down with your sisters and explain that you show up for him that way because no one else does. Your SS has both her mom and your dad and I\u2019m assuming her bio dad. Your younger sisters I\u2019m assuming have there dad. Your brother only has you and your boyfriend.", "\"Y'all realize I am not actually anyone's parent and just try to do the right thing? Maybe you should try and just do more of the right things and get off my back?\"", "the dad isn't the boy's father.", "I'd be surprised if there aren't plans for him to leave his mum's home and live with OP and her boyfriend when he turns 18. His mother and stepfather seem the sort to say \"You're 18 now, we're no longer responsible for you so vamoose.\"", "He doesn't have a mother to support him, he's an outsider in his mother's replacement family. OP and her boyfriend seem the only people to care about him.", "Tell your mother she's being unfair to her son. You'll go to a recital when she goes to a volleyball game if they're all for fairness.", "\"It's less fair that they would have 2 family members showing up, and brother would have none. If someone else wants to come and support Brother, I would happily switch off.\"", "Its not unfair that you don't act like they are your kids - cuz they aren't. Your parents are working with fuzzy math,", "Stand your ground, it will mean the world to your brother. As the oldest of 5 in a blended situation, I've seen \"parents\" do stupid things. Yours are being ridiculous. I guess they're mad because you make them look bad? Cause sisters are whining? \n\nYou aren't their parents. You can show favoritism if you want, siblings do all the time! You saw a kid in need, they apparently, only see their daughters and your brother is left behind. \n\nI'd ask them how far they are willing to go to scapegoat you? You're not allowed at their houses? They are willing to what - disown you - because you stood up for a neglected kid? \n\nI'd go to war with my parents for my brother if I were you. But that's what I did, worked out for me and bro.", "Does your dad ever go to his step-daughter dance, or your mom to her daughters\u2019 sport, or is it always the other parents? The way you\u2019re saying it, both your parents don\u2019t seem to be going.", "Do your sisters know this?  Maybe talking to them and explaining the situation more thoroughly from your perspective would help them come around also.", "Not weird. They\u2019re punishing the brother for being born. Even the dad who isn\u2019t related at all to the brother. Probably for ruining the marriage. Or could just be something moms manage to talk him into \u201chey does op support your other kids? No? Shouldn\u2019t op do so?\u201d The mom because without brother she\u2019d be better off in her eyes. That constant reminder of her not being the perfect person.\n\nThey just won\u2019t say that out loud.", "It made me seem them in a very different light when I found out about this. They weren\u2019t even ashamed. They simply do not care. \n\nLike I was helping her clean out the basement and there were three boxes of my brother\u2019s childhood stuff and half of it was just drawings of me, my brother, our mom and what seems to be his dad. When I showed them to my mom she was more upset about the fact that he didn\u2019t draw our sisters or his step dad. \n\nWe also found the letters to Santa there and I started crying reading them and all my mom did was crack a joke about his handwriting like what the fuck?", "He\u2019s living with us!

I wonder how she would respond if she was asked if she did.", "Agree, she has no love for her own child.  Wow, just.....wow.  This woman has made your brother the scapegoat for her selfish actions.   I can't with people like this.\n\nWhen you're able to please get your brother into counseling...this is messing him up more than he's letting on.", "You are the best sister he could ask for! I'm glad someone is in his corner, though your mum is horrible (sorry not sorry).", "This makes me so relieved!

Sounds like you guys have each other, why bother with the rest of your awful family?", "This is so great to hear!", "Well, that is her stepsister.", "Half-bro, actually. \n\nWe have seen countless 'you have no obligation to the affair baby' threads here. OP's dad really doesn't have a connection to this child. He's not an AH for not attending little bro's activities.
