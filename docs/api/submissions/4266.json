What ended up happening was the following:\n\nMy dad remarried another woman and gained a step daughter (17) who he treats like his own. My mother remarried another man and had my half sisters (14f, 13f). My brother\u2019s father is not in his life. \n\nAs a kid, I spent an equal amount of time with both parents but my brother was always with mom. From what I know, my brother doesn\u2019t call anyone dad.\n\nThis is something that really affects him. He\u2019s always wanted a dad and one of those happy little families and I recently found his letters to Santa from when he was younger and I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. It is something I now feel very strongly about.\n\nBecause my mom works a lot, no one ever shows up to my brother\u2019s games. He doesn\u2019t really care. Or at least acts like he doesn\u2019t. \n\nWell my bf and I decided to go to every one of his games and have been going to every game since last year. He always gets really happy. He even jokingly calls us his parents as we sit with all the other parents. This is something I only do for him.\n\nMy brother had his final volleyball game near the end of October and like always, I was going. \n\nHowever, as I was about to leave, my mom said she needed to talk. Ten minutes later, my dad shows up. They usually cannot stand each other so I thought it was something serious.\n\nThey just told me that it\u2019s nice that I go to all my brother\u2019s games but my sisters on both sides feel left out and I should make an effort to go to their things too. My 17 yr old sister had some dance rehearsal on the same day and they wanted me to go to that instead to prove that I\u2019m not playing favourites. They also said that they want my bf to go as well. \n\nI said no. They kept begging though and my mom told me that my other sisters had something coming up as well. I said no. Unless it\u2019s a major game or recital, I won\u2019t attend. I\u2019m already very busy and only do this for my brother because unlike my sisters, he has no one. My parents said that was unfair to the girls because they deserve to have an older sister. They both also agree that it\u2019s weird my bf and I act like his parents. \n\nI just told them that sucks but I have a game to get to. \n\nThey\u2019re both STILL mad at me. I haven\u2019t been allowed in either houses since that day and until I promise to commit to the girls as well but I keep refusing. My mom\u2019s called me mean, selfish etc and my dad keeps saying that he never expected this from me. I don\u2019t know, am I the asshole for refusing to do the same for my sisters?

I presume it is that latter seeing as you said attending his games is the ONE thing he gets. \n\nAnd as for your dad glad he\u2019s involved in going to his stepdaughter\u2019s practices and what not.

He doesn\u2019t get to demand that you attend. \n\nSo thank you for being there for your brother.", "Definitely NTA, but would it be possible to speak to your sisters directly? In a lot if these kinds of posts, what I notice is that the kids are usually more level-headed, as the adults are too emotionally involved. Maybe if you explained to them that you do care for them, but you are just trying to make up for your mom's (and his dad's) failing.

Emotional blackmail is not cute. What your parents seem to forget is that you have only so much spare time to attend your brother's extracurricular activities. My question is why don't your parents go to the daughters' events? How and why did this become your (and your boyfriend's!) obligation. You are an adult and can make your own decisions. If your parents don't like your choice of how you spend your free time, they can fill in the gaps. Period.", "Your parents started this. No one has been fair to your brother.

I remember being 22, let's be honest, you wouldn't be at your brothers games if he was given the love and attention he deserves from his mom. That doesn't make you an AH, that means your doing something wonderful because you see his pain.\n\nI also question the timing of your parents' \"talk.\" Sounds like they waited until his last game to lay this guilt trip and potentially make you not only not show, but with no notice, which would have crushed your poor brother. I think both your mom and your dad actually hate him and probably blame him for the affair fallout, which is so horribly tragic. He's lucky to have you. Your parents need to grow up.", "You have created a extremely tight bond with your baby brother and that's a wonder thing for both of you. Never allow it to be broken.

The difference here is her sisters always have parents in the crowd whether OP goes or not, and her brother would have nobody.\n\nThe parents are annoyed that OP is not helping them prove the brother is the unfavourite.\n\nHer parents have some nerve pushing this on her too - her dad doesn\u2019t go to his stepdaughter\u2019s events, only stepdaughter\u2019s mum does. And her mother doesn\u2019t go to the half-sisters\u2019 events, only the stepdad goes. So OP is being held to a standard her parents don\u2019t even meet.\n\nSibling relationships are different than parent-child ones. It is natural to be closer to some siblings than others. Having favourites as a parent is damaging. Being closer to one sibling than another is just life. My husband and his middle brother are close friends. His middle and youngest brothers spend a lot of time together too. The eldest and the youngest don\u2019t have much in common and they\u2019re cordial with each other but they don\u2019t hang out.

That\u2019s cold. The man loves sports but won\u2019t show up for his stepson. The man has a loving, involved relationship with his daughters but ignores his stepson who is barely three years older than his kids. OP\u2019s brother has had a tough childhood.
