My brother\u2019s father is not in his life. \n\nAs a kid, I spent an equal amount of time with both parents but my brother was always with mom.

Or at least acts like he doesn\u2019t. \n\nWell my bf and I decided to go to every one of his games and have been going to every game since last year. He always gets really happy. He even jokingly calls us his parents as we sit with all the other parents. This is something I only do for him.\n\nMy brother had his final volleyball game near the end of October and like always, I was going. \n\nHowever, as I was about to leave, my mom said she needed to talk. Ten minutes later, my dad shows up.

My 17 yr old sister had some dance rehearsal on the same day and they wanted me to go to that instead to prove that I\u2019m not playing favourites.
