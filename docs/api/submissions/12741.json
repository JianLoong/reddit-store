She loves her sister a ton which is a good thing as I believe supporting and helping your siblings as long as it doesn't ruin your own life (you will understand why I say this later on). We just put down a mortgage on a house in the suburbs of a large city. I 28M work in tech as a software developer with a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I make quite a lot of money so money issues never arose. GF doesn't work and does chores/ cooking in the house (both agreed on this). I was gonna propose to GF next year. But a problem arose about 2 years ago\n\nFor the last 2 years (prolly longer) gf has been sending money to her younger sister lets call her Emily. Emily got pregnant at 20 years old. Emily works as a waitress. The father is bouncing from job to job. Emily says that he is very lazy. He will disappear hours at a time without telling Emily where he's going or what he's doing.\n\nEmily has asked my gf on several occasions for money. My gf being the nice and sweet person she is says yes all the time. It started off as paying for diapers, no problem. Then baby clothes which also  no problem. Then daycare which I just brushed off. I talked with GF saying we cant always pay for everything and that helping out for a couple things is okay but not everything. GF reassured me and said that it would be stopping soon once they get their feet picked up which is fine.\n\nOne day I hire a financial planner. The next day I get an email saying my account has sent approximately $50,000 USD for the last 10 months! and have around $20,000 sitting in my account. I talk with my gf and she apologizes and says she knew that I wouldn't want to keep sending her sister money and how she just cares ab her sister.\n\nWE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EVERYTHING. Insurance, rent, car payment, day care, clothing for all three, dinners, dates, going out expenses. IT IS partly my fault because I never check my bank account.\n\nGF shows me text messages between her and Emily saying she needs the money. I then noticed a pattern where Emily would say \"Hey can you send me $$$ I don't have money for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" and of course gf says yes. I brush it off and GF says she wont send any more. THE NEXT DAY gf sends her $1000 because they needed car repairs.\n\nI talk with GF and we get into an argument where she says she will always help her sister no matter what. I understand TO AN EXTENT. We argue trying to understand each others POV. As stated before we had $20,000 and now were down to $19,000 and then how about the next time? and the next time after that? on top of our own expenses. GF then decided that she needs some time alone and that she will be at her mothers for the time being. Now I'm all alone in the house I thought I would live with the girl of my dreams.\n\nAITA for arguing with my GF for caring about her sister too much?", "created_utc": 1679312408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wge9l/aita_not_supporting_gfs_sister/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want to continue your relationship with your gf, you need to know this type of thing *will* continue to happen. My personal suggestion is to have a separate account for your gf and put a few thousand each month in it (whatever amount you think is appropriate) and tell her that's her \"fun\"/\"gift\" money, and that's all she can give away. Cut off her access to other accounts and brace for her anger because judging how she reacted, she's probably going to keep getting angry at you.\n\nSpeaking personally, I would heavily reconsider the relationship.

This is just mind-blowing.", "Omg NTA but revoke your GF\u2019s access to YOUR money. Holy fuck, the situation will not change and you\u2019ll end up broke.", "NTA. She stole 50k from you to support another family. Cut off her access to your accounts immediately. Rethink this relationship. The family is using you as a cash cow.", "Let me put it in a different way than others are: you\u2019ve never been her number one.  Her sister has.  NTA", "Girlfriend is definitely using you, my friend. Sorry but this is for sure the truth.", "Please separate your money do not allow her access any longer. I understand that your girlfriend is a kind person and is trying to help her sister but she\u2019s using you to do it. $50,000 in under a year that\u2019s a no !!!!! they are living extravagantly off of you they\u2019re going on dates off of your penny.  they\u2019re not busting their ass to provide for their selves.  why would they their sister has sugar daddy who will pay for everything.   Get a partner that is willing to build a life with you not live off of you.", "NTA- and if your sister really cared about her sister she would stop enabling her. NGL kinda jealous that you can have 55k disappear from your account and not notice.", "Exactly! Separate your accounts now before you are ruined financially. NTA. She is financially abusing you. She has already told you her sister comes first. Believe her. She won't change.", "I know I hope OP didn\u2019t put her name on the mortgage. He needs to get rid of her ASAP. \n\nThen she can take care of her sis all she wants\u2026from her own money that she works for.", "If your girlfriend\u2019s sister cannot \u201cget back on her feet\u201d on 5k a month\u2026 she\u2019s not going to get back on her feet.\n\nAnd what about when her parents retire? It\u2019s clear that she feels entitled to funding her family\u2019s lifestyle so they can live beyond their means. \n\nUnlimited access to your bank account before marriage is wild to me, even if she is doing work in the home. I can appreciate your generosity, but again, you are not responsible for funding her sister\u2019s family\u2019s lifestyle. And imagine how much more entitled she would feel once you are married.\n\nYou could tell your girlfriend that if she wants to support her sister, she can get a part time job and send her the whole paycheck. I think part of the issue could be that she\u2019s not understanding the value of the money and could be out of touch after not working for a couple years. Perhaps she would feel differently once she realizes how much work it takes to make that money (even though she\u2019d obviously be making less per hour than you).\n\nNTA", "Just empty the joint account and open one in your own name. If her name is on the account the bank will require a signature to remove her from it. \n\nThis is why 1. No joint accounts if you aren\u2019t married. 2. You have a \u201chousehold account\u201d that\u2019s shared and your own savings.\n\nEdit: \u201cyour own savings\u201d is a separate account with only your name on it.", "Problem is GF repeatedly lied and continues to lie - she acquiesced that she wouldn\u2019t send money for everything, then did just that. She said she wouldn\u2019t go overboard, then did just that. She said she will stop, then continued. OP, this woman will sell your house and belongings from under you if you give her access. Absolutely unacceptable relationship dynamic. Take her off your accounts, change passwords, separate all finances. I wouldn\u2019t trust her with her single penny at this point.", "Agreed! I'd be livid! 50k not a few hundred bucks. This is crazy", "Exactly, she embezzled the money! This is a shit ton of money and it's a very serious situation. \n\nAre OP sure that the gf is with him for pure love or for the fact that he is such a pushover that he funds the lives of TWO women???\n\nThe sisters might have set him up. I mean, no one is so bad at finances that they would not realise how much money 50 000 dollars is.\n\nI mean, I make 55 000 dollars a year and I work full time, have a degree and pay a lot of taxes. The sister got that amount without having to work. This is CRAZY.", "GF is on the accounts though, so the police aren\u2019t going to be able to do anything. OP needs to go straight to the bank and move everything to accounts she can\u2019t access asap", "And also claim it as a gift on your taxes, send the sister notice that you have done so, so she has to claim it on her income for tax purposes. That is, if you live in the U.S. if not, not sure what the tax laws are like outside the U.S.", "Also, cooking and housework for a 2-person household... does not exactly sound like a full-time job.", "I agree however over 10 months this could add up fast especially considering the next day she sent her a grand.", "Yes if you want to keep the relationship going, this is a good strategy. I don\u2019t know how I could ever trust someone that would spend 50k, agree not to do it again without talking to me, then the next day send $1000 behind my back. \n\nAt this point she and the sister may be splitting the money for when OP and her breakup, as 99.99% of people would never do this if they wanted the relationship to last. Even if that\u2019s not happening, to go to her moms like that is some sort of power play and she has been wronged, is just so messed up.", "Oh man it would be HILARIOUS if OP sent the sister a 1099. Not really, but kinda. \ud83d\ude02", "I work for a living and I don\u2019t bring home $5k a month after taxes and insurance.", "My husband and I have been married 20 years and we use this system - we have personal accounts and a joint account. The joint is for all household and kid-related expenses. The personal account is our \"mad money\" - money to spend on whatever, no questions asked. He doesn't see my bank or cc statements for these accounts and I don't see his.\n\nI made it VERY clear early on that I have no intentions of supporting any of his family members. If he chooses to do that, it will be completely out of his own funds, and the same if I choose to do so for my family.\n\nThis was the \"line in the sand\" we were both comfortable with and it has worked really well for us.\n\nI would be rip$hit if I were OP. It would be a relationship-ender for me.", "GF is paying for DATES and clothes for the 3 of them (I can't believe gf is okay sending money to pay for clothes for the deadbeat sisters bf). Not necessities. And gf doesn't even work, she can't send money like that", "> If your girlfriend\u2019s sister cannot \u201cget back on her feet\u201d on 5k a month\u2026 she\u2019s not going to get back on her feet.\n\nThere are no feet to get back on. OP is straight up getting scammed by his GF. I can't believe how many comment are treating this as a relationship spat and not straight up scam.", "Sorry, what\u2019s the difference between a joint account and a household shared account? Aren\u2019t both of those the same thing where you are each on it?", "If the cops can't help, perhaps a lawsuit is in order.  For sure, this should be the end of this financially abusive relationship.", "Sounds like my dream and I'm lazy as hell", "she's for the streets mate. she stole a median laborer's annual salary from you", "Yeah...she is buying groceries and house items...for her sister! I sure hope that the girlfriend is worth you not being able to afford the mortgage on your house.", "Change your account to a new account. Don\u2019t let her have access to a dime. Change the locks on your home.", "She\u2019s stealing from you. She may feel like Robin Hood, but you\u2019re not the villain and her sister isn\u2019t the overtaxed poverty-stricken people of Nottingham. \n\n**The woman you planned to spend the rest of your life with stole $50k from you, and has NO INTENTION TO STOP.** The fact that she doesn\u2019t keep any of it is irrelevant.", "If you\u2019re planning to stay with her you should make a separate account for everyday spending, clearly you need to budget her an allowance as she\u2019s not trustworthy. Offer to help her sister within reason only if you\u2019re part of the conversation. Maybe therapy too, cause your girlfriend is delusional spending that much cash without have I got a job herself.", "Nta. You should have a separate account for her that you put a certain amount of money into. Also, she should get a job and give that money to her sister. See if she\u2019s ok parting with her own hard earned money so easily. Take away her access to your money; she has proven she can\u2019t be trusted with it. And she lied to you.", "Well it's obviously not for the best lol. \n\nCancel her cards and revoke her access to the account until you two have a very serious talk about how she's repaying the money she stole.", "At the very least they're both mooching off you. I understand the homebody part of your gf was chosen by the two of you, but player three entered the chat and if she truly cared about her sister and truly valued and respected and loved you, she would get a job and fund her sisters life instead of taking from you.\n\nShe feels zero remorse, and that is the line in the sand for me. She may say she loves you, but this is not love.", "$50k over 10 months is $5/k a month.  Where I live, you\u2019d need to make ~$120k a year before taxes to sustain that lifestyle.", "Yep. She stole more than I made last year."]}
