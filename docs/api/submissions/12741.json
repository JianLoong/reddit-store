She loves her sister a ton which is a good thing as I believe supporting and helping your siblings as long as it doesn't ruin your own life (you will understand why I say this later on). We just put down a mortgage on a house in the suburbs of a large city. I 28M work in tech as a software developer with a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I make quite a lot of money so money issues never arose. GF doesn't work and does chores/ cooking in the house (both agreed on this). I was gonna propose to GF next year. But a problem arose about 2 years ago\n\nFor the last 2 years (prolly longer) gf has been sending money to her younger sister lets call her Emily. Emily got pregnant at 20 years old. Emily works as a waitress. The father is bouncing from job to job. Emily says that he is very lazy. He will disappear hours at a time without telling Emily where he's going or what he's doing.\n\nEmily has asked my gf on several occasions for money. My gf being the nice and sweet person she is says yes all the time. It started off as paying for diapers, no problem. Then baby clothes which also  no problem. Then daycare which I just brushed off. I talked with GF saying we cant always pay for everything and that helping out for a couple things is okay but not everything. GF reassured me and said that it would be stopping soon once they get their feet picked up which is fine.\n\nOne day I hire a financial planner. The next day I get an email saying my account has sent approximately $50,000 USD for the last 10 months! and have around $20,000 sitting in my account. I talk with my gf and she apologizes and says she knew that I wouldn't want to keep sending her sister money and how she just cares ab her sister.\n\nWE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EVERYTHING. Insurance, rent, car payment, day care, clothing for all three, dinners, dates, going out expenses. IT IS partly my fault because I never check my bank account.\n\nGF shows me text messages between her and Emily saying she needs the money. I then noticed a pattern where Emily would say \"Hey can you send me $$$ I don't have money for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" and of course gf says yes. I brush it off and GF says she wont send any more. THE NEXT DAY gf sends her $1000 because they needed car repairs.\n\nI talk with GF and we get into an argument where she says she will always help her sister no matter what. I understand TO AN EXTENT. We argue trying to understand each others POV. As stated before we had $20,000 and now were down to $19,000 and then how about the next time? and the next time after that? on top of our own expenses. GF then decided that she needs some time alone and that she will be at her mothers for the time being. Now I'm all alone in the house I thought I would live with the girl of my dreams.\n\nAITA for arguing with my GF for caring about her sister too much?", "created_utc": 1679312408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wge9l/aita_not_supporting_gfs_sister/", "score": 3252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want to continue your relationship with your gf, you need to know this type of thing *will* continue to happen. My personal suggestion is to have a separate account for your gf and put a few thousand each month in it (whatever amount you think is appropriate) and tell her that's her \"fun\"/\"gift\" money, and that's all she can give away. Cut off her access to other accounts and brace for her anger because judging how she reacted, she's probably going to keep getting angry at you.\n\nSpeaking personally, I would heavily reconsider the relationship.

She can help her look into scholarships or financial aid for college so that she can have a longer-term career plan. She can look into what kind of benefits she may be eligible for. She can look into pursuing the father for child support. Throwing the money at her sister is in many ways signaling that this is the status quo and potentially de-incentivising her sister from actually becoming self sufficient. \n\nWhere is her mother in all of this? Why is this money having to come from you guys? I would think your GF\u2019s parents, and the father and his parents are the more obvious choices for money or child care.

I'm in the \"cheaper\" burbs closer to Baltimore.  It's more expensive in DC proper of course.  So a number of reasons for high daycare costs.  Unlike preschool, daycare includes the coverage of infants as young as 6 weeks old.  Lots of specialized skills and care required (feeding, diapering, handling of bottled breastmilk, etc).  Strict teacher to student ratios.  It's like 1 teacher per 3 students for under 1 year old, 1 teacher to 6 six kids for under 2 years, etc.  So it does get a little cheaper as kids get older, but in preschool there might only be 2 teachers per like 25-30 kids?  No idea so I'm guessing here.  Also, I chose a slightly more expensive daycare because it provides 2 meals and 2 snacks a day.  I had no idea before I had kids that most need 3 meals and 2 snacks a day (so it's not like snacks are optional; most kids will get hangry).  Otherwise I would have to pack all that shit myself, so it's a huge reduction in my mental load and chore load. Finally, in DC proper there is a requirement that all daycares must be located on the ground floor of any building.  Pre-pandemic that was prime real estate.  In DC, if you're a commercial building owner, and you lease your first floor to a daycare, you are losing valuable lobby space or space that could go to a starbucks or other dining establishment that could you get your building more foot traffic.
