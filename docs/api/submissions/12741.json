She loves her sister a ton which is a good thing as I believe supporting and helping your siblings as long as it doesn't ruin your own life (you will understand why I say this later on). We just put down a mortgage on a house in the suburbs of a large city. I 28M work in tech as a software developer with a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I make quite a lot of money so money issues never arose. GF doesn't work and does chores/ cooking in the house (both agreed on this). I was gonna propose to GF next year. But a problem arose about 2 years ago\n\nFor the last 2 years (prolly longer) gf has been sending money to her younger sister lets call her Emily. Emily got pregnant at 20 years old. Emily works as a waitress. The father is bouncing from job to job. Emily says that he is very lazy. He will disappear hours at a time without telling Emily where he's going or what he's doing.\n\nEmily has asked my gf on several occasions for money. My gf being the nice and sweet person she is says yes all the time. It started off as paying for diapers, no problem. Then baby clothes which also  no problem. Then daycare which I just brushed off. I talked with GF saying we cant always pay for everything and that helping out for a couple things is okay but not everything. GF reassured me and said that it would be stopping soon once they get their feet picked up which is fine.\n\nOne day I hire a financial planner. The next day I get an email saying my account has sent approximately $50,000 USD for the last 10 months! and have around $20,000 sitting in my account. I talk with my gf and she apologizes and says she knew that I wouldn't want to keep sending her sister money and how she just cares ab her sister.\n\nWE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EVERYTHING. Insurance, rent, car payment, day care, clothing for all three, dinners, dates, going out expenses. IT IS partly my fault because I never check my bank account.\n\nGF shows me text messages between her and Emily saying she needs the money. I then noticed a pattern where Emily would say \"Hey can you send me $$$ I don't have money for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" and of course gf says yes. I brush it off and GF says she wont send any more. THE NEXT DAY gf sends her $1000 because they needed car repairs.\n\nI talk with GF and we get into an argument where she says she will always help her sister no matter what. I understand TO AN EXTENT. We argue trying to understand each others POV. As stated before we had $20,000 and now were down to $19,000 and then how about the next time? and the next time after that? on top of our own expenses. GF then decided that she needs some time alone and that she will be at her mothers for the time being. Now I'm all alone in the house I thought I would live with the girl of my dreams.\n\nAITA for arguing with my GF for caring about her sister too much?", "created_utc": 1679312408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wge9l/aita_not_supporting_gfs_sister/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action I took that should be judged is telling my GF to stop helping her sister.

Yes, she's been doing chores and cleaning, but if she's adding to expenses and sending 10s of thousands of dollars, it'd be cheaper for you to get a housekeeper and sign up for a meal service.\n\nI think you're right to definitely hold off on even the consideration of marriage right now - financial poor communication and entitlement seems like a pre-wedding marriage death toll.", "NTA but I would honestly let her stay at her mother's she literally stole 50 grand from you and has basically pretty much said she isn't going to stop, her leaving and staying at her mother's is her way of trying to get you to cave to her and her sisters demands.

That's an insane amount of money and she showed you that she has no problem continuing to send it. Call her bluff, and cut her off from your savings.

That's not a great thing, as you've learned. Maybe you earn enough that you don't have to worry about it, and hey, more power to you if that's the case. But I think most people check their accounts way more frequently, and it's probably a good idea for you to do that as well.
