My mum always bought my ex a birthday present, usually a nice one.", "I really needed that. \ud83e\udd79\u2026 as cliche as that sounds. I appreciate your support\u2026 I am quite cruel to myself behind all the self-centeredness. Thank you good human \ud83d\ude4f", "This reply actually brought tears to my eyes\u2026 you\u2019re right. Thank you for that, really. \ud83d\udc96", "Yes. Exactly. They massage MIL\u2019s near-insatiable toxic ego and mooch. I don\u2019t need her or her husband\u2019s money and so she has no power over me EXCEPT when my birthday rolls around and I\u2019m forgotten.\n\nWhen the entire family is together, she talks down to my husband and tells everyone he was the big mistake (he is the first born of two) and they got it right with his younger brother\u2026 she is grosssss\u2026 and I don\u2019t tolerate her belittling him and being manipulative to me or with anyone\u2026 howeverrrr this stupid bday thing is my kryptonite\u2026 crazy, I know. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's so weird it's amazing how we have such different cultures only a few miles apart :)", "Ah - that explains a lot!", "See, this is why I love Reddit because I learn so much about the world outside of my own back yard. I do think some cultures are preconditioned to be more emotionally needy like myself lol", "It's wierd in england, trust me a few miles here is the difference between california and Texus, shires are very diffrent places.", "That is super interesting! I guess microcosms scale up or down in proportion to the said country\u2019s size both geographically and population-wise, it would be fair to say. Learn something new on here everyday. Cheers!", "NAH\nyour expectations are strange", "NTA\u2026but you need to stop doing gifts for them.  Let your husband take care of everything.  And your husband sucks too.  Why can\u2019t he say something to his parents?  Hey, mom and dad, what are you all doing for wife\u2019s birthday?   You have a husband problem more than in law problem.", "For me, birthdays are very important precisely because I did NOT have a loving family growing up. So I totally get the \"they don't love me, I'm not worthy\" feeling that can come from not being acknowledged, *particularly* when you see them acknowledge other people. You feel you are being singled out.\n\nAnd \"they just can't remember you\" is not the great explanation your husband seems to think it is because it is literally \"they don't think about you\". And your interpretation of it like that and feeling hurt are completely valid. \n\nTrying to approach people and ask \"why do you celebrate that person and not me\" is really hard. I agree. But you know, if you can accept whatever the answer is, with as much grace as you can muster, you will feel better. If it's \"yeah, we don't care\" then you KNOW. If it's \"what? your husband said you didn't like presents!?\" then you know that. \n\nThat, btw, is what I got as a response when I finally made myself ask some co-workers why everyone else got a birthday cake but me. The answer was \"Person A said you didn't like birthdays.\" Person A lied because ... get this petty bs ... she didn't like carrot cake, which is what I wanted. So she told them all I said \"no birthdays\". It went on for three years before I finally opened my mouth and asked. Oy vey. \n\nAnyway, I feel you and feel for you. It's not petty because it does feel like people you thought cared, do not. That can hurt. You are allowed to feel hurt. You are also allowed to grow from that and choose to say \"okay, they don't care as much as I hoped, so now I know that and I choose what to do and feel about that going forward.\" I get a little melancholy now and then in a \"I wish it had been better\" kind of way over a friendship I had where it turned out the other person didn't like me nearly as much as I liked them.\n\nI also wonder now and then if maybe out there in the world is someone who is sad I didn't like them or care for them and I didn't and so didn't even notice they liked me. I try to use my sad feelings as a way to be more empathetic for others. I bet I've been thoughtless to others. So I need to recognize that sometimes people really do not think about me. I can wish they did, but they don't.", "ive been living with my partner for over a year and a half, we have a nearly 7 month old too. not once have his family said happy birthday, nor asked when my birthday was. they all know its september 11th and i know they remember because they all made fun of the date being 9/11. its a very small reason of why im no contact with any of his family, and he has barely any contact with them now either. he knows not to mention anything about his family to me unless its actually important and while it may sound dickish to people, i do have very good reasons to which he understands completely and he knows what i deem as important.\n\nit sounds like your husband\u2019s a bit of a dick, his family are twats and you feel left out. \n\nid like to mention that im an only child too and my partner has 8 half-siblings and a very large family, i always felt like the odd one out around them. they only liked me when it was of convenience to them.", "Nta but your husband is. Time for him to put the big boy pants on and explain that he is married. He expects you to be treated as a family member. OR you could go a different route and not acknowledge anyone else birthday or any gift giving holiday. Then your husband will need to explain why.", "NAH - you are spending your special day upset because someone doesn\u2019t acknowledge you while other people are probably tripping over theirselves to get to you and celebrate you. \n\nFocus on what you have. Put your energy in what you have. Don\u2019t let the one thing you can\u2019t have send you in a tailspin.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what can happen in life, for all you know his parents could die before yours. There\u2019s no guarantees. they have showed you who they are, just accept it. \n\nNot everyone wins the lottery with their actual family, and soooo so many of us have much worse when it comes to in-laws lol.\nI\u2019m not saying your concerns don\u2019t matter and your feelings don\u2019t matter. But what I\u2019m saying is you can\u2019t change them. It\u2019s not your fault they are the way they are. You have lovely people to focus on, focus on them and be happy on your birthday and keep being your sweet upbeat self.", "NTA a hundred percent. They don\u2019t need to go all out or anything, but like you said, they should show at least minimal acknowledgment of your birthday, even just a happy birthday text with well wishes, especially since they shower so much affection on their other DIL. If it weren\u2019t for her I\u2019d say they need to make more of an effort to remember/remind themselves of your birthday, but since they seem to have no issue remembering and celebrating their other DIL, this feels passive aggressive to me.", "NTA but I think you have a husband problem, not an in-law problem.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird for someone to receive a gift/ happy birthday text from someone and make no attempt to reciprocate. I would kind of get it if you were just his girlfriend, but you\u2019re married, at the very least you\u2019d think they\u2019d have gotten you a small Christmas gift by now.", "NTA. I told my therapist once that I go all out for my husband on his bday/Father\u2019s Day, and he doesn\u2019t do the same. She asked me why I still do it..so now I just match his efforts \ud83d\ude02 \nBasically, match their effort..which is none. Less stress for you!", "Maybe they just don't like you, who knows, and honestly stop sending them cards and stuff, it's only going to make you feel worse. NTA", "YOUR FEELINGS ARE NOT STUPID.  EVER. Stop giving them the time of day if they can't see how amazing and thoughtful you are their loss. Most people have a toxic in law because USUALLY they think that their child can do no wrong. I gad thos happen to me with my bf ans I talked to his mom in person ( the timing was bad the day of the viewing of my bf grandmother who passed) but we talked and cleared the air and now things are better than ever.  Talk to them if they don't care then why should you. I would focus more on your husband and how he should stand up for you. Maybe marriage counseling now before things get worse. DEFINITELY NTA", "NTA. I have self-centered in-laws who would look down on me because I came from poverty and they're very well off, and they would send me a birthday gift, or take us out to an expensive restaurant, or even send me cash so I could pamper myself. Every year I'm in the calendar on Jan 1st, because that's how society rolls, and they would rather die than not conform to social niceties.", "This is what I was going to say.  You stop everything.  See how they feel then.  Plus your SO needs to tell them it's your birthday and call them out for their lack of care and blatant favouritism to SIL.", "Best advice here. Let them go OP. They are uninterested, just match that energy.", "Definitely, OP can't buy they're love.", "I don\u2019t disagree haha\u2026 too high too.", "I've been in a similar situation and my therapist told me stop trying with them and we each handle our own families now. Any time there's a complaint, I turn to my husband and say \"your mom wants...blah blah\" works like a charm!", "See those people are actually the best.  Because they don't say anything directly to your face, you don't have to do anything until they do.   \n\nIf someone comes to you and says that MIL is mad about something you did or said.  You can send them right back to her and say \"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, have her give me a call/text so we can discuss\" and you keep doing that every single time. It's no fun if they don't have any gossip.   \n\nThe flying monkey is completely removed from the situation and the only thing they have to take back to MIL is to contact you directly...every single time. \n\nAnd if they do confront you after not contacting you directly...You get into your big ole bus, look right at flying monkey and say \"Well how odd, I told FM to have you give me a call \\[x times\\] so we could discuss, didn't they tell you? \\[big eyes here\\] I feel horrible you've been upset all this time\" Bonus points if you can inject the right amount of \"bless your heart\" into your voice.", "This has been my approach with horrible parents-in-law, and when I've given examples of my tit-for-tat here in Reddit, I've been told off for being passive-aggressive. Guess what? it's worked for almost 30 years and I don't anything I don't want to do. My kids love and respect their grandparents, but don't expect anything other than money from them and rarely see them. My husband is happy I stopped making waves and sees them regularly. I now visit everytime I'm invited, but behave like a guest.", "OP, you seem really fun and quite down to earth. I love the fact you are self aware. \n\nHowever, like I\u2019m learning too, you need to learn to be kinder to yourself. Being self aware isn\u2019t just about picking out our negatives and focussing on them. It\u2019s about acknowledging those negatives and trying to change those for the better, if possible (basically not allowing them to be an insecurity and/or a reason to be nasty) but also loving our positive attributes too. \n\nI\u2019d stop being so nice to the in laws, put in as much effort into the relationship as they do, (could be considered petty, but for me I find it\u2019s better for my mental health, I\u2019m just returning what others are putting out) and if they\u2019re not happy tough crap. They\u2019re clearly a negative influence in yours and your spouses life, so take a step back. Take the good from them, (if there are any) and leave the bad. And remember if they\u2019re not people who you\u2019d go to with your secrets or for advice then their opinions should not matter. (Same could be said for reddit lol but sometimes a strangers/outsiders opinion helps). So when they moan or ignore you take that moment of peace and enjoy you. \n\nHave zero expectations from them and honestly when they do something half decent you will be pleasantly surprised instead of greatly disappointed. Maybe a pessimistic view of the world to have, but has really helped my mental health as it stops me from expecting people to match my energy.", "NTA. \n\nThis explains everything!", "NTA\n\nReturn the feelings. No more gifts or acknowledgement from you.", "NTA. Start forgetting everything related to your In-laws. Your husband has delivered the perfect gift.\nMy relative played a similar game with my mom. Now mom doesn't even care if she is alive or not.", "NTA. Your husband knows that this hurts you and he should have spoken with his parents long ago and reminded them that it is your birthday and it hurts him that they do not acknowledge his wife.\n\nAlso, let your husband handle gifts for his family, and you handle yours.", "NTA, I totally get your perspective. But it also doesn't sound like you are celebrating your birthday with them, which is maybe why they are not going out of their way to think of you on your birthday. You could invite them to your birthday dinner (or whatever you are doing to celebrate).", "NTA. My in-laws know I don\u2019t do much celebrate anything anymore because most people I know don\u2019t care to even try for me. They are literally the only ones who do. Hell-they are the only ones who remembered our anniversary besides myself.", "I hesitate to give judgement but NAH. By now you should have realized you can't make people have the relationship you want with them. You can't expect people to do the things you do, just cause that's what you do. You will be disappointed every time and they likely won't care. Your in laws sound kind of jerkish along with your partner but they aren't likely to change after all this time and do you really want something from people who do it as an after thought.", "NTA I\u2019ve only been with my husband for 9 years. My in-laws not only remember my bday, but my wedding anniversary, dating anniversary and the anniversary of me moving here. Only put in the effort you received. It\u2019s hubby\u2019s responsibility now.", "these people dont care about you, my aunt-in law (yes my mother in laws sister) even sends me cards for thanks giving , christmas, easter and birthday cards to me and my son.\n\nthey dont deserve your energy, so dont bother.", "You have a beautiful soul, OP, and are very kind and thoughtful. It's extremely sad and hurtful your inlaws are so disinterested in including you in any kind of birthday acknowledgement. Your husband should be more supportive of you with reminding his parents of the one day of the year that means so much to you. Let's face it, its easy for hubby to be dismissive of your feelings when he's not the one being forgotten. I would say you wouldn't have it in you to be vindictive by leaving your inlaws birthdays up to your forgetful husband, knowing what angst it would cause. Have a serious heart to heart with your husband and ask him how he'd feel in your shoes. His lack of empathy is deplorable. You are definitely NTA!!", "NTA. Just stop trying with them. Stop with all the gifts.", "Husband here, not OP\u2019s husband though.  I made a point of reminding my dad about wive\u2019s birthday after mom passed. No malice on his part but he needed the reminder. No reason he can\u2019t do the same. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I did all the Birthday Cards & gifts for more than 15 years. I finally had enough. How/what do you get for people that are retired & own 2 homes?  I should clarify, my FIL & SMIL are a dream. MIl & SFIL are ok, but since I stopped sending cards/presents, I don't even get a card. (My Husband does) I get we are all adults, (even my Mom gives us both a card every year) but, it still smarts.", "NTA But you might have to accept this as who they are. My bil and sil are legitimately terrible people but can still do no wrong with my in laws while they barely acknowledge me and my husband despite all the effort we put into our relationship with them. Sometimes parents are just biased and nothing will change that.", "Exactly this", "He also should be reminding your parents when your birthday is, or setting it up on their calendar/phone contact.", "You answered your our questions!!! His parents are toxic disgusting people. He is probably as bewildered with your parents spoiling him as you are by his parents complete lack of care.\n\nI at first agreed with others that you have a husband problem... but with this info... he's used to being the black sheep thus knows there is no point fighting for you- because it never worked for him. \n\nI recommend you have a heart to heart with your hubby. Perhaps even look into therapy for you both together and separately.\n\nAdd this info to your main post.", "So why do you want those people to like you? You don't even like them. They don't treat your husband well. Better to have them ignore you than insult you. \n\nInstead of asking your husband to make them acknowledge you, tell him you know they talk down to him all the time and you support him changing his relationship with them to minimize exposure to their bullshit.", "You seem like a truly kind person and like someone else said, i wish you were kinder to yourself and didn\u2019t put yourself down. When one of my friends says something bad about themselves, I often admonish them with something akin to, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about my friend that way!\u201d \n\nI feel like saying that to you, too, even though we\u2019ve never met. \n\nPerhaps you and your husband could kind of team up and make a plan and practice being kinder to yourselves.\n\nSo if you are at his parents\u2019 house and MIL says something cruel like he\u2019s a mistake, you could say, \u201cHow dare you talk about my husband that way!\u201d And you both immediately leave. \n\nIf you put yourself down, your husband can remind you not to talk about his wife that way.\n\nAnd maybe refuse to participate in their events, when they don\u2019t acknowledge yours. And say why. Pre plan these things that are likely to come up and practice sticking up for yourselves.\n\nYeah, you\u2019ll rock the boat, but you\u2019ll also be training them *and yourselves* to treat you both better. And if they don\u2019t, well\u2026fuck em! Go LC/NC. You both deserve better. \n\nAnd that reminds me\u2026check out the below link if you\u2019ve not seen it before.
