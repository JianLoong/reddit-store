It sounds like the waitress punched in an order for steak and chicken by mistake and doesn't want to admit to screwing up.", "NTA. Previous restaurant professional here. I saw the title and came here to back my brethren\u2026 then I read what happened. You didn\u2019t escalate a situation. It\u2019s bizarre to expect a guest to pay for a dish they did not order. The server just brought a bill over with a whole ass steak on it, the steak is still (presumably) sitting in the back with no owner, and they insist they can wrap it for you? But before you confronted them, what, the expectation was that you would pay for an item you never ordered and also never received? Like what was the thought process here on the restaurant\u2019s part?", "NTA. She changed her mind before the waitress left the table so the steak should never have been cooked. That's not your mistake and there's no justification for charging you for it. \n\nAs an introvert with social anxiety, I can understand your friend's discomfort and she's also NTA. In this case, the AH is the waitress who didn't get the order right and tried to make you pay for it.", "NTA.  The restaurant made the mistake and shouldn't have charged you.", "Definite NTA\u2026\n\nI read your additional comments and yes, that restaurant really messed up. Your friend changed her mind at the table during ordering so the steak shouldn\u2019t have been prepared in the first place.\n\nYour friend likely just didn\u2019t want to make waves since she\u2019s been to this place many times, but since you were paying, you did have a right to argue this particular bill for an item you didn\u2019t want\u2026", "NTA  \nthe staff messed up and you where trying to get things sorted out like an adult. as long as you did it in a respectful way it shouldn't be a problem", "You're NTA. It was the mistake of the people are the restaurant and shouldn't cost you anything. Sorry your friend didn't like it, but she was being awfully generous with your money.\n\nETA: it's also kind of odd that they did not bring the steak to your table since they \"didn't know which table it was going to\", yet it was on your bill. Something smells off with this one.", "NTA. It sounds like the restaurant\u2019s error, and it was reasonable to ask for a refund. It\u2019s not like you were berating the server for no reason. It\u2019s weird for your friend to want you to prioritize her concerns over getting a refund for a dish you didn\u2019t order. \n\nIf you were being overly rude or aggressive in handling it I can see it, but it sounds like you were just trying to get it resolved. \n\nAlso am curious if you got your refund in the end?", "NTA - Seems like the server made a mistake, ordered both the chicken and the steak. She/he probably didn\u2019t realize it until the food was ready. There isn\u2019t such a thing as a dish not having a table number, there was no steak that \u201cno one knows where it goes\u201d in the back, unless she threw away the kitchen ticket that would have had the table and dish information. \n\nShe made a mistake and didn\u2019t want to tell her:his manager for fear of getting into trouble. \n\nIt\u2019s bizarre that she didn\u2019t offer (until you inquired about the bill) to have it wrapped up since the kitchen made it any way, I\u2019d assume she was hoping you pay for it, then she could keep it for herself.\n\nEdit: clarified statement", "NTA.  Your friend is for trying to control how you handled it when it was your money at stake.  If she didn\u2019t want to be seen as a problem customer, she could have said to the waitress, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the confusion!\u201d And then let you handle it.", "Info: you say that it hadn't been ordered, but it was somehow also cooked. Did your friend actually change her mind as you were ordering/ before waitress left the table, or was it after the waitress had already taken the ticket to the back?", "NTA.  I don't think you did anything wrong and she shouldn't have asked you to shell out that kind of money when it was the restaurants mistake. You should have demanded they remove the item from your bill.  Did they?", "NTA. You were the host. You get to complain. It was your money. \"Feel free to hide in the loo or wait in the car, then. I'll be with you in a moment. My money isn't about your feelings.\"", "NTA. Also The whole bit about not knowing where the steak was supposed to go was a lie. When they ring in bills it says the table or the server keeps track. Either way every food item cooked has a way of knowing what table it\u2019s supposed to go to.", "NTA! Restaurant should have taken care of their mistake, and if your friend didn't want to make waves, she could have offered to pay for the steak.", "NTA\n\nThis was an error by the waitress since the order was changed well before the kitchen would have fired up a steak.\n\nAnd what the hell kind of games were they playing by charging you for something they didn't even bring. If they had brought the additional entree to the table you STILL would not have been responsible for paying for a mistake that was solely the fault of the restaurant.\n\nYour friend really needs to develop \\*normal\\* social behavior because it is not aggressive or rude to refuse to pay for a meal one hasn't ordered - and the restaurant knew this and didn't even bother to bring it to you. As others have posted, did they think you were so stupid that you wouldn't notice a charge for steak.\n\nFWIW, your friend says she is a frequent customer. Any good restaurant who recognizes a frequent customer would have been embarrassed at this and would have offered a dessert or some other comp to make up for it. Because frankly I would not want to return to a restaurant that essentially tried to scam and shame me into paying for something that was their responsibility", "NTA\n\nIs your friend young?  I\u2019m 45 - in my 20s I might have reacted exactly like her.  Young women especially are conditioned to try to smooth things over and be as accommodating as possible.  It took me a long time to learn how to stand up for myself.", "NTA and I believe there had been another plan afoot. The order may have been entered unintentionally wrong, but they proceeded to plainly attempt to steal from you.\n- there is no plausible reason they wouldn\u2019t bring out the steak to the meal\n- there is no plausible reason it would be waiting in the kitchen where it could be boxed up\n- there is no plausible reason the waitress wouldn\u2019t have it immediately refunded. \n\nThe only real question in my mind is if your dining companion was in cahoots with the restaurant. It\u2019s all just a little too suspicious that SHE was the one that changed her order, and SHE insisted it be brushed off.\n\nSounds to me like her buddy was going to have to pay for the steak when the plan didn\u2019t work out.", "Thats lame. NTA", "NTA. \nThe waitress messed up the order and your friend is the one who changed her mind in the first place. \nYour friend could have offered to pay for the steak if she didn\u2019t want to have an issue.  I suspect she was embarrassed and this may be the result of having narcissistic traits.", "Yeah definitely NTA. From what I read it was the waitress\u2019s mistake. Your friend said just take the steak as though it was just an extra meal you were getting for free. If she didn\u2019t want to be seen as a problem customer then she should\u2019ve either taken it and offered to pay you or just left and let you handle it. Then sending you that text later on?  That\u2019s just unnecessary. She seems more concerned about her public image than her friends\u2019 feelings. Either way you\u2019re not a problem customer for the way you handled it and I\u2019m sorry if your friend made you feel as though you were. Hope you guys work it out!", "NTA no one ordered the steak. If your friend was so worried about the restaurant getting paid for what wasn\u2019t ordered SHE could have paid for it & taken it home. Good for you for standing up for what was right & not being taken advantage of.", "NTA. Sounds like the waitress was counting on a free steak for herself.", "INFO: was your friend willing to cover the cost of the steak?", "NTA\u2026 this is just weird. Tell her that it wasn\u2019t her money to decide.", "NTA. Why would you pay for a meal that you didn\u2019t get? Did they refund you?", "NTA. I'm a  passive person, so when wait staff fuck up like this I just let it happen. But sometimes I'm out with more assertive people who want to make a fuss, and when they make a fuss anyway it bothers me that they are prioritizing their desire to correct over my desire not to cause a stir. But those are situations where we both pay and have a stake in what happens - here, you were paying and so you were going to fight for your $. You knew that made your friend uncomfortable, so you offered that she could leave and you would see it through. \n\nIf she ever faces any repercussions for having eaten with you on this occasion then it'll turn out she was right and you really shouldn't have escalated but that seems incredibly unlikely. It was a preference question and as the one paying the bill your preference wins.", "NTA. It was the restaurant\u2019s mistake and they should eat the cost. If your friend wanted someone besides the restaurant to pay for the steak, she could have volunteered to do so herself. She had no business volunteering you.\n\nMy cynical side is showing. Do you eat steak? Is there any chance she thought the restaurant\u2019s error might result in a serendipitous free steak for her?", "So this is a psychic restaurant where they cook the meal before you order it? Wow!\nNTA and your friend needs to back off and see that you\u2019ve been conned.", "Ask her if she was so concerned why didn\u2019t she pay for the steak?", "NTA What did you do that made her \u201c hurt\u201d the waitress made a mistake and I worked at a restaurant before. They can easily refund you. They won\u2019t lose money because of one plate. She feels guilty because of her, this whole mess happened. She\u2019s trying to put blame on you. You did nothing wrong. You friend could\u2019ve taken the beef and pay you the difference if she was that \u201c concern\u201d tsk.", "NTA\nRestaurant was trying to screw you two. That should make your friend not want to go there again. Especially since they were trying to double charge for her meal, a seemingly loyal repeat customer.", "NTA. wasn\u2019t your fault, it was the restaurants!", "To make amends, the server should have offered the third meal to you free of charge.\n\nIf not, they didn't deserve a tip, due to inferior and dishonest service.", "INFO: when you say it was \u2018at the last second\u2019, do you mean she literally said \u2018I\u2019ll have the steak, no never mind, the chicken\u2019? Or was it more like she ordered the chicken and then ten minutes later told the waitress she\u2019d rather the steak?", "NTA but maybe your tone of voice or approach was more aggressive than you realized. It seems bizarre if she really thought you should pay for a meal no one ordered for the sake of her momentary comfort.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's just ridiculous then. People do that all the time. This was not your mistake", "That\u2019s\u2026 wow.  Is she normally so conflict-averse, or do you think there was something else going on here?  Did she just want to squeeze an extra dinner out of you?", "Did you ask?\n\nI guess NAH outside of the restaurant (and the question really seems to be more between you and your friend). It was the restaurants mistake, they should have fixed it. If it was a big deal to your friend an easy compromise would have been that she paid for it.", "Ok that\u2019s ridiculous, NTA. It\u2019s absurd to charge you for that. And for your friend to expect you to pay for a whole extra steak to avoid friction over the restaurant\u2019s mistake.", "That sounds like the waitress\u2019s mistake, not yours or your friend\u2019s. She knew the order change before she ever went into the kitchen, so she must\u2019ve put the wrong order in and is now trying to charge you for it. That\u2019s completely ridiculous and awful customer service. I would totally not tolerate that.

It aligns with the aspects of her personality I am aware of.", "I said since I\u2019m paying it\u2018s kind of my call and she did not say anything like \u201cI\u2019ll pay, I just don\u2019t want to make an issue.\u201d", "Yes, the waitress hadn\u2019t left our table yet.

Anything else? \n\n\nFriend: Yeah, actually, I\u2019ll have the chicken.", "Yeah, NTA.

Yeah she should know better. Not a very good friend.  Sorry she didn't stick up for you.", "I mean, at least that means her intentions weren\u2019t nefarious or anything, so that\u2019s good.  But just because she hates conflict doesn\u2019t mean she can force you to accept essentially being scammed by the restaurant\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t mind being taken advantage of when something unfair happens to her, whatever, she\u2019s an adult and can make that choice.  But it\u2019s kind of ridiculous of her to expect other people to just roll over even when it\u2019s clear there\u2019s something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s not nearly the same thing, but I still remember years ago taking my picture for my college ID.  I was with a friend, and we both wear hijab.  The person taking the picture told my friend she had to take off her scarf for the picture to be \u201cvalid\u201d.  My friend was upset, but was going to do it, because she didn\u2019t want to make waves or whatever and thought she needed to \u201cfollow the rules\u201d.  I was all \u201coh HELL NO\u201d and told the photographer that neither one of us was going to be taking our scarves off, and she could go get her supervisor if she liked.\n\nThe photographer ended up backing down (but was quite obviously not happy about it lol) and my friend told me I didn\u2019t have to \u201cmake a scene\u201d.  She felt like everyone was staring at us, and it made her feel really uncomfortable.  I did feel bad about that - but there was no way I was going to let that photographer just make up her own rules about what constituted a valid school ID.", "The way this was said makes it sound like she wanted both, but if they didn't bring both then that's their mistake.", "Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "Probably just my poor paraphrasing. It seemed pretty clear it was an \u201cinstead\u201d in the moment. \n\nBut, yah, they didn\u2019t bring the steak. If they\u2019d brought both out then we\u2019d realized it was a misunderstanding (but still got to eat it) then I\u2019d have probably not said anything else.", "NTA! But I find it weird that 1) as you\u2019re ordering and your friend changes her mind, the kitchen had already started the order, because that\u2019s their problem, not yours: they should have waited until you had finalized the order. What they did is not customary. \n\n2) So they charged you, but then said that they did not know what table it was going to, but they charged YOU\u2026 wow.,, \n\n3). As to your friend, yeah, it\u2019s nice to be generous w/other peoples\u2019 $$$ .\n\nYou\u2019re right to stand up for yourself.", "This was my question, too. Had the server already walked away from the table then the friend could've ASKED if the order had been put in yet and if no could she change her choice. Then if it had already been put in she should've just stuck with her original choice and called it a day. But changing it before the server ever left the table? Definitely a f*** up on the server's behalf and they didn't want to be blamed or be stuck with paying for their mistake."]}
