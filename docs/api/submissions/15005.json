Some parents come in as it\u2019s near the dance ending and ask if they can step in and two-step with their kids. He doesn\u2019t respond, so I cheerfully tell them to go ahead and have fun.

He made himself look bad. Does he not think the teachers aren't going to say something and talk behind his back about his attitude.  He was acting like a teenager, not a school official.", "NTA.  I get that your fiance was only there because he had to be, but he'd better get used to that and learn to fake having a good time.  I was a teacher.  I went to events I would rather have avoided.  When I went to them, I smiled, said all the right things, and tried not to feel too uncomfortable.  I generally ended up enjoying myself if I made the effort instead of sitting around watching my phone.  At one dance, I taught one of my junior high students to slow dance (his mom couldn't teach him because she was in a wheelchair and he wasn't comfortable asking one of his older sisters because \"that's just too weird, man\").  I'm not a good dancer, but we laughed about stepping on each other's feet.  Then, the girl of his dreams (I'd hear him talking to his buddies) asked if she could cut in because he looked like a fun guy.  I lost my dance partner, but he gained a girlfriend he married right before he joined the military right after HS.  I had interesting conversations with kids who didn't say much in the classroom.  I loaned one student a couple of bucks so she could dunk me when I climbed in the dunking booth at the Spring Field Day.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, but your fiance needs to seriously re-evaluate his own behavior.  Not only towards you, but towards the whole event.  Kids (better known as \"his future students\") asked him to dance and he blew them off.  Those kids got the message loud and clear that he doesn't care about them and isn't much fun.  Great job of building relationships.", "NTA", "NTA and he needs to be working somewhere else.", "NTA.   \nYour fianc\u00e9 is an AH, and will get nowhere in life.\n\nAt least you saw it before you got married.", "He\u2019s actually a great admin and I have never seen this behavior ever. I asked him what the hell was up and he admitted to being frustrated with his doctoral advisor for yanking his chain all week about his dissertation. I can absolutely sympathize, but that\u2019s not a reason to be an ass.", "Exactly!", "One word: Oklahoma", "I\u2019m not positive he knows the difference \ud83d\ude05", "Very very out of character.", "Because I love him and I can genuinely say that this is incredibly out of character and I have never experienced this type of behavior before. He\u2019s since apologized. And is issuing a school wide apology tomorrow.", "How do you know he is though? Do you work there too?", "Exactly. He definitely took his fianc\u00e9e for granted at this event.", "\u2705", "If it\u2019s safe for you to do so, sit down a have another conversation with him. Use plenty of \u201cI feel, I felt\u201d language to express how his behavior impacted you, and see if you can find out what was happening for him. Methinks there\u2019s something else afoot but unless he\u2019s honest, you are just guessing.", "I\u2019ve done some subbing and I have a STEM after school group when I\u2019m not at work. Our close friends circle are all teachers or administrators and  few of them asked if he was sick because he was so unlike himself. One of the coaches pulled him after church today to check in because he\u2019d heard he wasn\u2019t like himself. He\u2019s sheepishly admitted maybe he was a dick after reading this and apologized.", "*maybe* ? I usually don\u2019t mind age gaps but in this case it\u2019s a head-scratcher if you\u2019re having to correct the behavior of someone older\u2026", "\ud83d\ude02 \u201cokay damn, I was a dick and I owe my students an apology as well. I shouldn\u2019t take my personal frustrations out on anyone else.\u201d He\u2019s following along.", "Wonder if this is how he reacts to his chair/committee \ud83e\uddd0", "\"I shouldn't take my personal frustrations out on anyone else.\"\n\nHe should have that calligraphied and framed, and hang it on his office wall. Maybe also tattoo it on, like, the back of his dominant hand, so he'll see it ALL THE TIME. Because taking out his \u2013 totally unrelated!! \u2013 personal frustrations on other people is *never* OK. And while I'm glad he's finally figuring that out, it's more than a little concerning that it took him so long, and so much input from so many other people, before he could even begin to see a glimmer of truth in what you said to him.", "I know he snapped at his advisor as he submitted his dissertation for final review back in Mid-December. And after 13 follow up emails in which he got radio silence, they came back 24 hours before submittal to the committee and said he had 40 some changes to make. He did that and 24 hours after that his advisor has said his last chapter feels \u201crushed\u201d. He\u2019s hella frustrated with them for doing zilch for review until less than a week before his defense. He is under a lot of pressure the last couple of weeks, and again, while I sympathize, I\u2019m not the one to be mad at.", "Holy cow I can\u2019t imagine snapping at mine\u2026I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s at but I chose my chair and other members because I respect them a LOT and can\u2019t imagine acting like that\u2026", "He got a new advisor this semester (his last) due to a severe illness on the part of his other chair (who has been with him for two masters and now all but one semester of his doctoral seat). The new advisor has been very catty and has already told him that this isn\u2019t for him and he doesn\u2019t want a student. My fianc\u00e9 will send in a chapter according to the schedule and MAYBE three weeks later can get a response of edits and suggestions IF he has sent out two or three touch bases. It has been a nightmare. So I can understand his frustration with all of it right now. \n\nHe agrees that he should have handled this instance better and is drafting a school wide email of apology."]}
