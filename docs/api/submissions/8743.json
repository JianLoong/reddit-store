When it actually was finalized we both agreed that my ex would retain the family home; however, they would be required to refinance the home into only their name. There was a time period given, it was they could refinance within the first 6 months and they would be given 50/50 of the equity, after 10 months they were given 40/60 of the equity, after  year they were given 30/70 of the equity and after 18 months I was given the ability to sell the house with my choice if realtor and me deciding on the final sale of the home.\n\nWe are at the point now that we are very quickly approaching the time limit that I get to sell the house, and my ex is telling my lawyer (not me but specifically only my lawyer) that they are not able to refinance because of their credit score, they are requesting that I allow them another year to get their credit in order so that they can refinance.\n\nFirst and foremost my ex never had the credit score to qualify for a mortgage without me and my credit. Secondly, my ex is refusing to provide any documentation that proves that they actually did in fact apply for refinancing and was denied. They are refusing to provide me with what their current credit score is.\n\nWe have children involved with this. We have shared custody of the kids, and if I sell the property and my ex is no longer able to prove a home for the kids, sole custody will go to me. My ex claims that I am using the fact that they agreed to the divorce agreement and that they would refinance in a specified time as \"manipulating the system\" so that I get sole custody of the kids. I find this ridiculous as my ex had legal representation at the time and was fully aware of what they were signing and agreeing to.\n\nI feel like I really have no options here. They are putting me in a situation where my only option is to sell the house but they are also trying to make it seem like I'm \"manipulating\" the situation. I think they are ridiculous and just need to do what they agreed to.\n\nAdditionally, my ex has specifically told the kids that I am \"trying to sell the house and make them homeless\" which is both wrong and not accurate. My kids always have a home here with me.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA:\nCurrently they are paying the mortgage, and in the summer of 2020 I agreed to sign mortgage paperwork for them to reduce what was the monthly mortgage payment down to half. I believe that this was part of some sort of COVID relief and prior to me agreeing to sign the updated mortgage agreement with the bank they had been missing payments.\n\nThis is not about money for me. Even though we have shared custody I still pay child support and have no issue doing so as I want my kids to have the same lifestyle with my ex as they have with me.\n\nUpdate: had a meeting with my lawyer. Ex has been told if they can provide proof of their current credit score and proof that they actually applied for refinancing and was denied that I will consider delaying a year, otherwise we are moving forward.\n\nAlso lawyer sent a cease and desist if any communication with the kids that includes telling them that I'm trying to sell the house and make them \"homeless\".", "created_utc": 1675138166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnzdq/aita_for_selling_the_house_i_previously_lived_in/", "score": 585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Standing up for yourself and leaving an abuser is the right example to set. You have to do this for your kids and yourself. Please document any alienation he does and share it with your lawyer. Family court does not smile on one parent demonizing the other to kids.", "And it's the ex's fault he waited so long that he no longer gets any equity. He should have known at the 6 month mark that he wouldn't get approved to refinance and sold it. It's not like your credit score and your salary are a huge surprise.", "It doesn't, but you have to admit it's funny that OP wrote the post in a gender-neutral fashion but people STILL read genders into it and got it wrong.", "Because Reddit hates husbands. And wives. And boyfriends and girlfriends. And roommates. And in-laws. And parents. And bosses and co-workers.", "Sure, and that's what I meant in my opening line:  \"OP has the right to move forward and protect their equity\".  It's a matter of whose eyes you want to view this through however.  Legally, OP can take everything and drive by wherever their ex lands laughing.  Through their kids' eyes however, they'll be a movie villain.  \n\nOP showed zero care or concern if the kids lost their other parent.  It's not their responsibility or legal obligation to care about that.  It might even be for the best.  But OP's kids will likely not see that for decades or ever.  OP will just be the evil person who took their parent away.  This stuff is textbook, happens all the time.  \n\nI'm just saying OP needs to consider those points when deciding how much of their legal right they'd like to exercise.", "Don\u2019t forget children and step parents", "Thanks. I knew I forgot something.", "OP indicated they were given bad legal advice/representation", "NTA.  Don't \"talk it out\", don't waiver, you have a divorce decree that specifies what happens by when, just follow that.  Plain and simple, after a contentious divorce follow the divorce decree to the letter, anything else will be abused.", "NTA  Sell the home per your Legal Divorce decree.  If spouse is bringing the kids into it to them, you need to address this with your lawyer.\n\nIf you want to give them a legal extension you can, but they will have to show you what you are requesting.  IF not then you can choose to follow the other legal path and sell the home.  If he cared he would have refinanced it in his name already, or allowed you to sell it when he received some of the equity.", "NTA - Your ex had legal representation so they new what they were getting into. Also if they were that concerned, they would show you their financial paper work and the denial. On another note, your ex telling your children that their mom wants to make them homeless is emotional abuse, I would tell your lawyer.", "NTA. She agreed to the deal, and you're abiding by it. And you're obviously willing to take the kids, who indubitably will be awarded to you given that she can't provide a home for them. It sucks that they're caught in the middle, but sometimes that's just how it works.\n\nMy Uncle got divorced 20 years ago. Like a fool he signed his rights over to his ex in the house that HE paid for (he was the sole breadwinner). That caused a chain reaction of things that's now led to none of his kids being in touch with him. His wife was able to win just about every court battle along the way for one reason or another, starting with him signing his house over to her. She turned the kids against him. He signed his rights over so that the kids would be able to stay there, stay in their schools, and stay with their friends. She sold it and moved to another state to be closer to her family. So doing things like that for the kids can backfire.", "NTA.\n\nEx has had about 4 years (if I read that correctly), to get their shit together", "So\u2026\n\n- You\u2019re willing to pay (child support etc.) to maintain the same living standard for your kids at your exes and yours.\n\n- You don\u2019t want to force a sole custody arrangement.\n\n- You don\u2019t need the money.\n\nINFO: Then why do you insist on selling and being TA? Because you can? How\u2019s making ex homeless helping keep the kids with them comfortably?\n\nYTA your ex is right, the only reason you would do this is to force sole custody and play innocent when your ex is left with nothing. GTFO if you think it\u2019s hard to see through.", "It is not germane to the financial agreement signed or to the resolution of this issue. It\u2019s not in any way.", "Kids have been in therapy since the split", "You are saying wrong. \nIn order to move on OP needs to be free from this contract. And the ex can move, rent, what ever. This is manipulation pure and simple.", "Also with this debt in OP\u2019s name it severely affects their own financial standing in regards to being able to purchase a property or finance a vehicle", "It wasn't a trap though and you know.....he had a lawyer too.  That's what they're there for....to spring those traps so you don't get screwed.   All dude had to do is make on time payments and reduce his debt so that he could refinance.  He clearly knew from the beginning that he had bad credit but continued to make decisions that would impede his ability to refinance the mortgage into his name.  Otherwise the mortgage (and house) would've been solely his after 6 months.\n\nShe (OP) has every right to want to unentangle herself financially from her ex.  She shouldn't have to have her financial stability affected because her ex doesn't want to pay the mortgage on time.", "No, but it is to whether someone is an asshole or not.", "There is a difference between cutting all ties to someone financially and cutting all ties to them when it comes to the kids.\n\nI am trying to cut all ties financially. \n\nI want my kids to have a good relationship with their dad. I would never try to stop that.", "It\u2019s not germane at all.", "Yeah that\u2019s parental alienation and I would have them back in custody court just for that if it were me.\n\nNot my fault you accepted a bad deal and then sat on it. Because the fact he\u2019s not willing to provide proof he even *tried* which should be like, super easy to do, tells he probably didn\u2019t do it all.", "I talked to my lawyer today. I can file a motion to have the divorce agreement changed so that I refinance the house on name and he has to rent the house from me. This is subject to a judge agreeing.", "If he (the ex) felt that the deal was unfair he should've had his lawyer negotiate a better deal. OP is doing much more for her ex than I would, and the ex is taking advantage of OP at this point, the ex has had plenty of time to get it together. NTA", "I had a conversation with my lawyer today and heard some good news and bad news. Good news is, I don't have to be financially tied to him.", "I actually had a \"fuck yeah\" moment today after speaking to my lawyer and seeing the email he sent to my ex. \n\nHe put an immediate cease and desist on him communicating to the kids that I'm trying to sell the house and make them homeless.", "He knew at the beginning that he didn't have the credit to refinance.  It was stupid of him to agree to the initial 6 month period refi period when he needed at least 12 to18 months to improve his credit.", "I specifically wrote it gender neutral because I know Reddit tends to have a bias towards genders and I wanted a non biased answer.\n\nIt's interesting to see peoples opinions based on them thinking I'm the male or female in this situation and in general is really not a good look for Reddit.", "You redditors sure are a contentious bunch", "Lawyers aren't miracle workers. They have to be clear with their client about their options, and the costs associated with each one. If the ex's financial state isn't great, they may not have been able to afford further legal fees.", "Woot!\n\n\u2026 and the bad news?", "I don't want to say in case my ex sees this and realizes it's about him.", "And landlords.", "No the OP did not say that at all, quite the opposite:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI find this ridiculous as my ex had legal representation at the time and was fully aware of what they were signing and agreeing to.", "Totally fair! Hope it all goes as well as possible. \n\nYou\u2019ll be so happy when he is no longer a factor in your day to day life."]}
