When it actually was finalized we both agreed that my ex would retain the family home; however, they would be required to refinance the home into only their name. There was a time period given, it was they could refinance within the first 6 months and they would be given 50/50 of the equity, after 10 months they were given 40/60 of the equity, after  year they were given 30/70 of the equity and after 18 months I was given the ability to sell the house with my choice if realtor and me deciding on the final sale of the home.\n\nWe are at the point now that we are very quickly approaching the time limit that I get to sell the house, and my ex is telling my lawyer (not me but specifically only my lawyer) that they are not able to refinance because of their credit score, they are requesting that I allow them another year to get their credit in order so that they can refinance.\n\nFirst and foremost my ex never had the credit score to qualify for a mortgage without me and my credit. Secondly, my ex is refusing to provide any documentation that proves that they actually did in fact apply for refinancing and was denied. They are refusing to provide me with what their current credit score is.\n\nWe have children involved with this. We have shared custody of the kids, and if I sell the property and my ex is no longer able to prove a home for the kids, sole custody will go to me. My ex claims that I am using the fact that they agreed to the divorce agreement and that they would refinance in a specified time as \"manipulating the system\" so that I get sole custody of the kids. I find this ridiculous as my ex had legal representation at the time and was fully aware of what they were signing and agreeing to.\n\nI feel like I really have no options here. They are putting me in a situation where my only option is to sell the house but they are also trying to make it seem like I'm \"manipulating\" the situation. I think they are ridiculous and just need to do what they agreed to.\n\nAdditionally, my ex has specifically told the kids that I am \"trying to sell the house and make them homeless\" which is both wrong and not accurate. My kids always have a home here with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675138166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pnzdq/aita_for_selling_the_house_i_previously_lived_in/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m assuming this wouldn\u2019t even rob him of his kids, despite the sole custody, if you guys could work out some sort of amicable visitation agreements for him to still see/spend time with the kids.\n\nAt the end of the day he was given a year and a half.

Agree to the year if your ex can provide: \n\n* documentation they have applied and been denied.\n* documentation that they are making any progress at improving their credit score.\n* This one year extension will be documented and signed by both of you.\n\nAnd if that documentation is not provided you will act on the divorce decree and put the house up for sale.   \n\nThey signed this agreement, they knew what was coming, if they didn't make any effort to meet the requirements of that agreement, that's not on you.", "Definitely NTA. The parameters were set. They need to follow through.", "There was already a request but I'm going to add it again because I think it's relevant. \n\nINFO: who is paying the mortgage? Based on the reducing share of their equity in such quick succession, it seems like it's you, so I get why you want to sell it, but I'd like to not make assumptions. If they are milking you to pay down the principle, then there's a problem. But if they are paying the mortgage, thus paying down the principle, and having trouble saving and paying off debt to raise their credit score in order to buy the house, then you're the one milking them for equity.\n\nI get you both signed an agreement, but you are also allowed to set the example for your kids that they can treat a former partner with respect and in turn expect to be given respect. (We have a lot of aspects of your relationship missing, so I will also add as a side note that means teaching them to not be or treat people as a doormat, but whichever wording you go with is dependent on how your relationship was and how it ended.)", "Nta sell it and split the equity 50/50. The x can use it to rent a place till their credit is fixed if ever.", "NTA. Your goal is to untangle finances with this person you are no longer married to in as expeditious way as possible. An agreement is in place that attempted to allow him to remain in the home under certain conditions, and he can't meet the conditions because of decisions he's made in his life that have affected his credit score. \n\nNone of that is your problem (any more), and talking about losing the home and custody is an attempt to manipulate you. This is a financial deal, and you're executing that deal as it was laid out and agreed to.", "NTA, my vote probably would have been ESH if your ex hadn\u2019t involved your children as a manipulation tactic to get to you. Your ex saw the terms and signed the papers, that\u2019s not your fault at all. If you feel bad selling It, i would still cut them in at 20 percent of the profits especially if they contributed to upkeep in some way via mortgage payments or other bills so you could ensure they still can manage to find a place to rent and your children would be safe and secure visiting them. If your ex didn\u2019t contribute anything at all- just sell the house. The way they\u2019re involving your kids is petty, desperate, misplaced, and gross.", "I mean, it sounds like you are trying to sell the house under your spouse and possibly render them homeless and trying to get sole custody. That\u2019s pretty shady. I also have no idea why anyone would agree to those terms. \n\nSomething feels off here. I feel like this is gonna be up for thirty minutes and then some bombshell is gonna drop and then it\u2019s gonna be revealed you did something awful.", "INFO: Why do you assume your ex won't be able to provide a home just because the current home is sold? Or does it say if the home gets sold then you automatically get sole custody? If it says the second part then the courts and your ex's legal representation failed the kids. The kids should not lose a parent over something like this. \n\nThe best way to handle this is to sell the home and split the equity 50/50 to allow your ex to get into a new rental home and to continue shared custody.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But the divorce agreement has to be adhered to because these large financial disputes can be crippling.\n\nThe house has a mortgage on it. One party in the divorce is effectively evicted while their name remains on the mortgage. It's the responsibility of the remaining party to take on the burden of the loan and repay the investment the evicted party contributed. \n\nIt took a year and a half to reach the point where OP has this control over the property. A year and a half for the ex to sort something out. They are also refusing to provide evidence that they have made efforts to rectify the situation and remove OP from the mortgage. \n\nDepending on OP's situation, this may be excluding them for eligibility of a new mortgage to get themselves a new home. I have seen this happen. Great credit score, reasonable deposit available, just can't get a loan because they are on another mortgage. \n\nIn this situation where OP is excluded from the house, and ex can't afford the house, selling it is the best (probably only) option.
