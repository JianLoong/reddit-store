There was a time period given, it was they could refinance within the first 6 months and they would be given 50/50 of the equity, after 10 months they were given 40/60 of the equity, after  year they were given 30/70 of the equity and after 18 months I was given the ability to sell the house with my choice if realtor and me deciding on the final sale of the home.\n\nWe are at the point now that we are very quickly approaching the time limit that I get to sell the house, and my ex is telling my lawyer (not me but specifically only my lawyer) that they are not able to refinance because of their credit score, they are requesting that I allow them another year to get their credit in order so that they can refinance.\n\nFirst and foremost my ex never had the credit score to qualify for a mortgage without me and my credit. Secondly, my ex is refusing to provide any documentation that proves that they actually did in fact apply for refinancing and was denied. They are refusing to provide me with what their current credit score is.\n\nWe have children involved with this. We have shared custody of the kids, and if I sell the property and my ex is no longer able to prove a home for the kids, sole custody will go to me. My ex claims that I am using the fact that they agreed to the divorce agreement and that they would refinance in a specified time as \"manipulating the system\" so that I get sole custody of the kids. I find this ridiculous as my ex had legal representation at the time and was fully aware of what they were signing and agreeing to.\n\nI feel like I really have no options here. They are putting me in a situation where my only option is to sell the house but they are also trying to make it seem like I'm \"manipulating\" the situation. I think they are ridiculous and just need to do what they agreed to.\n\nAdditionally, my ex has specifically told the kids that I am \"trying to sell the house and make them homeless\" which is both wrong and not accurate.

Based on the reducing share of their equity in such quick succession, it seems like it's you, so I get why you want to sell it, but I'd like to not make assumptions. If they are milking you to pay down the principle, then there's a problem. But if they are paying the mortgage, thus paying down the principle, and having trouble saving and paying off debt to raise their credit score in order to buy the house, then you're the one milking them for equity.\n\nI get you both signed an agreement, but you are also allowed to set the example for your kids that they can treat a former partner with respect and in turn expect to be given respect. (We have a lot of aspects of your relationship missing, so I will also add as a side note that means teaching them to not be or treat people as a doormat, but whichever wording you go with is dependent on how your relationship was and how it ended.)", "Nta sell it and split the equity 50/50.

I feel like this is gonna be up for thirty minutes and then some bombshell is gonna drop and then it\u2019s gonna be revealed you did something awful.", "INFO: Why do you assume your ex won't be able to provide a home just because the current home is sold? Or does it say if the home gets sold then you automatically get sole custody? If it says the second part then the courts and your ex's legal representation failed the kids. The kids should not lose a parent over something like this. \n\nThe best way to handle this is to sell the home and split the equity 50/50 to allow your ex to get into a new rental home and to continue shared custody.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One party in the divorce is effectively evicted while their name remains on the mortgage. It's the responsibility of the remaining party to take on the burden of the loan and repay the investment the evicted party contributed. \n\nIt took a year and a half to reach the point where OP has this control over the property. A year and a half for the ex to sort something out. They are also refusing to provide evidence that they have made efforts to rectify the situation and remove OP from the mortgage. \n\nDepending on OP's situation, this may be excluding them for eligibility of a new mortgage to get themselves a new home. I have seen this happen. Great credit score, reasonable deposit available, just can't get a loan because they are on another mortgage. \n\nIn this situation where OP is excluded from the house, and ex can't afford the house, selling it is the best (probably only) option.

Why are you asking reddit these questions instead of said lawyer? \n\nNot knowing your family dynamic or your kids, I'd say morally, this is going to haunt you for a time. Depending on ages and who your kids prefer right now, you may make quick enemies out of them. Even if eventually they realize why you did it and that it was a deal you had made a year ago. Worst case scenario, they pick your exes side and stay there for a very long time. So I'd consider that over everything. You know your kids better than anyone. He's an AH for trying to turn them against you, for sure. But if there is a good chance he will be successful, will selling the house now really be worth it?

Ex shows they were denied because of credit score. \n2. Ex shows they have been improving their credit so just need more time to be able to refinance. \n3. Ex admits attempts at interference with your relationship with the kids and agrees to correct this behavior.\nAdditionally, the agreement should stipulate any further attempts at interference results in negating the agreement and immediate eviction so the house can be sold/you take possession.

In multiple ways. \n\nJust feels like both parents aren't worried about their kids nearly enough. I made a comment somewhere about it that says a lot more and don't feel like typing here. \n\nI'm actually with OP on just going ahead and selling (if that is her lawyers recommendation) but only if she thinks her kids won't basically hate her for it. Just because dad is in the wrong and trying to get the kids to play favorites doesn't mean it won't work."]}
