Our relationship was always good but it\u2019s taken a downturn recently. When we got together we had the same job, made similar amounts of money and attended a lot of social events both separately and together. \n\nA year ago, Jane won a life changing amount of money (in the millions) and quit her job to set up some charities that help our local community. She\u2019s always been active in our community. She donates books to the library, volunteers for book groups, goes to community council etc. but ever since setting up her charities she spends a lot of time away from home and at events. She always invites me but I rarely go as they\u2019re long and boring and frankly the amount of them she goes to is exhausting. She\u2019s now so well known in the community we can\u2019t go out without someone talking to her on the street or recognising her. I feel like I\u2019m in a relationship with her voicemail sometimes. \n\nI decided to confront her about it and we had a massive argument, during which she said she enjoys talking to people in our community and hearing how she helped them. I told her she\u2019s selfish, and throwing money at a small ass town doesn\u2019t make her famous. She said she wasn\u2019t trying to be, and that I know how much the community and helping people means to her and why, that I had gone too far. She\u2019s now staying with her aunt and won\u2019t talk to me.

That said, she sounds like she could be in a far more joyful and less bitter marriage if she offloaded OP.\n\nIf we are as generous to OP as possible that his concern is actually the amount of quality time he gets with his wife (and community events or benefits or library tours or what have you don't count, maybe they would for her, but not for OP, and that needs to be accepted), and not he's upset she spends her money on helping other people instead of moving him out of their 'dumb small town' and living in luxury, jealous of her happiness and success, and envious other people like her and his control (hi, I saw that age gap, OP) in the relationship may be jeopardized by her social standing, then yes, he would have a point that perhaps she's too busy at the detriment of her own relationship. Unfortunately he's rather transparent and his real, pettier objections are quite obvious.", "You forgot the other half of the bible verse, \"and husbands must serve their wife\"", "Lmao forgot the meds today, have you?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Lmao", "You make no sense. She's doing what she wants already", "Except if she won the lottery while they were married it would be their money. They are both rich.\n\nRemember that lady who won the lottery kept it a secret and divorced her husband. He then sued and took all the money.", "I wonder if ALL of the money is going into her charities and organizations. Maybe he thought her winning that money and quitting her job would mean vacations and new things.", "Your opening sentence says it all really. He isn't interested in her passion. What kind of partner is that? Not saying they have to do it together all the time, but to say her passion bores him? \n\nIf you read his post back, I feel its easy to read between the lines. He says he's bothered that they get interrupted in public by people wanting to talk to her. Then adds in that he never sees her. Clearly both can't be true. Conveniently, what he insults her with is the former. If he never sees her, that's what they would have argued about. Not her being famous. \n\nHe also makes zero mention of him suggesting they do things together. Things she misses out on. His passions. \n\nI think it's just a control/resentment thing. That's certainly what he has insulted her with. Not feeling neglected. Not that she makes no effort. Why? I suspect, because it isn't the case.", "Yup. True", "As I said, she may have gotten caught up in what she is doing and not have been making enough time for him. But why does bringing that to her attention have to take the form of confrontation and denigrating her passion? Why couldn\u2019t it look something like, \u201chey honey, you know I\u2019m proud of you for all the great work you are doing and I know it means a lot to you. But I\u2019d love it if we could carve out some extra time to spend together outside of that. \u201c", "I suppose so, I'll amend my statement a little to E-S-H 51/49. I think the wife probably isn't intentionally ignoring her husband, she's probably just so caught up in her new lifestyle that she doesn't realise that he's feeling neglected. Especially if she truly feels like her charities have helped the community. OP says she has reasons for wanting to do this, which makes me feel like something in her past is driving her to do all of this stuff.", "Yeah nowadays people need to stop giving money out and think of themselves for once", "Oh well who cares \ud83d\ude02 it makes sense to me", "Not all partners need to be I terested in each others passion. Especially when it's so.ething that's only come up since she won the money. Don't read between the lines. Making assumptions doesn't help anyone.", "Sure, it could take a different form. But sometimes it doesn't when your SO blatantly shuts you down. Seems pretty small compared to the wife ignoring him. Especially since he only got upset after she shut him down.", "Alright, you drive a tough bargain, but I'll take this offer to my client and propose he accepts the plea deal.", "How exactly did she shut him down?", "You made me chuckle good fellow :)\n\nEdit: changed pronouns to \"fellow\" because idk", "He confronted her, and then they started to argue. Clearly she wasn't receptive to what he had to say. The OP doesn't say how he confronted her, but if she cares about him, it wouldn't matter much how he confronted her. He confronted her because he loves her, and if she loves him, she would take it as such and would be forgiving to him for being upset. It's unclear if the wife loves him if the formalities of bringing the matter up for discussion with her matters more than he does.", "Wow. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s just ridiculous. The idea that you are meant to be receptive to anything your partner says no matter what form it comes in, regardless of if they are being aggressive or putting you down, because \u2018oh but they are only saying it because they love you\u2019 is some toxic rubbish that enables abuse. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not even clear that he DOES love her. Sounds to me more like he is threatened by her success and popularity.", "Oh, HELL, NO. You are stepping over the abusers playbook line.\n\nIt doesn't matter that I hurt you because I love you. I only hit you because you made me so mad. \n\n'..If she cares about him, it wouldn't matter how much he confronted her.' and 'If she loves him..would be forgiving to him for being upset.'\n\nSo basically, she should shut up and take whatever form his anger takes because he says he loves her. What an absolute trash take.", "Not anything your partner says, but if you have been ignoring your partner, and they bring it up, then if you care about them, you would listen. She didn't. And of course he loves her, why else would he be so hurt by her ignoring him?", "I don't know why you are talking about physical assaults. No one has mentioned that. He confronted her because she was ignoring him, and she didn't care about that. That got him upset."]}
