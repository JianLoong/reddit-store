The problem is our mother. She is putting her grief onto my brother and he has to sit around helping people grive the life hes going to lose rather than giving him a great life for how ever long he want. \n\nI understand grieving, i am too but i dont put that on him and its not like i want my mum to go through it alone but my brother is NOT the person to share her greif with. \n\nThe other night i saw out mum just crying and holding him saying she doesnt want to lose him. Afterwards when my brother was asleep i told her she needs to stop grieving for him in fornt of him and if she cant do that she shouldnt at all. That shes making her own dying son deal with her own grief when hes already dealing with his own mortality. She should be supporting him, not the other way around. If she wants support she can talk to me, dad or a therapist but don put your shit on him. \n\nI do think i was a bit harsh, but it comes from a place of frustration. I had my own cancer scare when i was 16 and was stuck dealing with everyone elses grief while i wasnt able to deal with my own shit, i dont want that for my brother. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Im reading all comments and just taking it all in for now, but for people asking if this is also how my brother feels? Yes. Hes always been a shy boy and had trouble expressing his feelings when he doesnt want to hurt others but we have talked about this and he dislikes having to support others but has trouble speaking up. My brother is also low needs on the spectum so can have trouble expressing his own emotions and dealing with others emotions.

I think it is time for your dad to contact your brother's doctor and get your mom into therapy with other parents who are going through the same thing. This way your mother will be able to grieve with other parents who are going through the same thing with their children. Many years ago one of my friends was going through the same thing as your family is going through. She was so filled with despair that she was the same way as you're describing your mom. She would constantly cry and told her daughter that she couldn't leave her and how much she meant her. Her husband was between a rock and a hard place and we suggested that he find a group for her to join through the hospital. The oncologist was able to get her involved in group therapy and it helped more than we imagined it would. She met other parents who were in the same boat, as per se'. Some of their children were in the beginning stages, while others were in long enough that their children were leaving their earthly shells behind. One of the things she learned in this group therapy was to not show her despair or grief in front of her daughter or to her daughter. She learned that the more she did this to her daughter, the more despair her daughter went into as well. They told her to always be loving and positive around her daughter because this is a sign of Hope. Yes, we lost her daughter a few years later, but she still attends therapy and helps other grieving parents to this day. This is what I recommend for you; talk to your dad about getting your mom and the rest of you guys into group therapy through the hospital. I want you to know that you are your brother's hero! You have always been his hero and he is always looked up to you. You will always be his hero ok sunshine xoxo", "I would fully expect my mother to be a mess if I was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

So does your brother.", "NTA.  People seem determined to stain the world with their grief.  This is a personal experience and should not have a significant impact on others.  If mom needs and audience to grieve, she can hire a therapist to help her.\n\nYour brother is very lucky to have you to stand up for him.  It may not be feasible, but if you can take him somewhere he loves away from that sadness, it would be a memory that would last forever.", "When my aunt was told she was terminal she and my uncle decided to knock a few things off the bucket list before she got worse.

I had a health scare and have actually thought about how it'd go with my parents and I think I'd tell them to try and hold it together in front of me because my focus would have to be on myself and not having to prop them up.

I hope you and your brother AND your mom/parents can create some more happy memories until the end. Objectively, you're not wrong in what you said to her, but grief and loss aren't objective. She probably already knows that you're right, but she's a parent having to watch her child slowly die, and that is unimaginable. Everyone should be in therapy, now and later, and in the meantime, continue to make those memories with your brother and maybe see if you can include your mom as much as is appropriate?", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry that you're going through this.  You are absolutely right in telling her that.  She needs therapy.  He doesn't need to feel guilty on top of everything he's going through.  She needs to hear those words.  She needs to stop putting her grief on him. She is not helping him, she is hurting him.  \n\nI can't imagine the pain she's in right now.  I can't say I'd be any different.  She can't see through her own grief.  You all have precious time together and he should get the most out of his life.  She needs to hold it in and allow him to live as best as he can.  I would also apologize for the hurt, but it needed to be said.", "I agree with you! She needs to be using other resources for emotional support. \n\nThat being said, I'm sure she has no idea how to do this and is incredibly distressed watching her son die in front of her.

You are awesome for trying to protect and support him here. But I can only imagine the tearing grief your mum must be feeling - from what you describe she is literally clinging to him, trying to hold on to him and keep him there with her, safe in her arms like when he was a baby. She needs professional help so she can help him. I don\u2019t know where you are based, but in the UK we have charities like MacMillan, who also provide support to the loved ones of people with cancer.

My mom was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago (thank god we discovered early on and we and the doctors are very optimistic about the outcome) and I was so so so scared, I wanted to cry, to scream, to fall in her arms and let her made me feel better like when I was a kid. I didn\u2019t do any of those things because she doesn\u2019t need to be strong for me, in trying to be strong for the both of us and just be the woman who can fix what is fixable right now. I\u2019m dealing with my emotions by myself right now till I can see my therapist, my mom needs to focus only on herself.", "Yes exactly!\n\nMajor NTA. You did what was right for your brother and your family. Your mom needed to hear this. It's hard on her but she needs to realize it's as hard for you too and a hundred thousand times harder for your brother. She needs to do what's best for him and try to spare him as much added angst as possible. Maybe in her head she doesn't see  what's wrong with her behaviour because she thinks it shows him how much she loves him but that's not the way to go. Even if she's overcome with emotions, the best way to handle it is to suck it up as much as she can when she feels it coming and discreetly go and deal with her emotions somewhere private.", "Interesting concept. Thanks for the info!!", "In a weird way a lot of people already do this, and it ripples out stress far further than I think most people realize.\n\nBetter is to just contain and manage it yourself, imo. But obviously I think certain situations like terminal disease are much more meriting of this strategy than many other things.", "She should go to a professional therapist.", "She doesn't need to seek that support from her dying son.", "Mom needs to do better and deserves to be called out for her nonsense.  Get a therapist to lay this on.", "She doesn't need to pretend it isn't happening.  She needs to stop trauma dumping on her dying son.", "She can cope with someone else.  Burdening those in a terminal state is immature and toxic.", "Yeah like why wouldn\u2019t he want to console his crying mother everyday due to his upcoming death? Surely he doesn\u2019t want to have a bad atmosphere surrounding him in the last few days he is alive. He should worry about his mother and deal with his own grief of dying aside. /s \n\nSeriously he\u2019s already dying she needs to get herself together and not ruin his last living days. Don\u2019t make him have his last days of just people around him crying and bringing down the atmosphere.", "Asking the person who is dying to comfort others is a selfish act by the living. \nWhere is your empathy on that.\n\nMom need the plain unfiltered truth, no time for cuddling here. \n\nNAH, ok mom is soft ah.", "The dying person is having to comfort someone else regarding his own death, meaning that he can\u2019t go to the person he is comforting in order to be comforted. She is quite literally making him deal with her grief. You don\u2019t go to the dying person to make them comfort you over their death.", "Doesn't the op have a right to be concerned for his brother and making the time he has left easier for him?", "If you're forcing your grief onto your dying child you're an asshole with no emotional maturity. The kids already fucking dying and you want him to deal with the guilt of how it's making his mom feel? Get the fuck out of here, I hope no one you love ever gets seriously ill because if that's how you would react then you're just making *them* suffer to make YOU feel better", "\"me, dad or a therapist\" is there bro", "She needs to be a parent and let her dying son live.", "She is burdening her children with her grief.  She will have the rest of her life to toil about this loss, but for now, she needs to buck up and help this transition be as positive and filled with love as possible.", "Edit to say: I'm sorry this is happening to your family. Try to cherish every moment you have left with him. Take care.", "Ring theory is for when you can't manage it yourself. It's just a guide for not placing burden on people who have too much shit to deal with already, not claiming pain that's not yours to claim, and supporting those who need support. It's all very well to say \"handle it yourself\" for the outer outer rings, and hopefully whoever they talk to would be like \"bro, this isn't your business, see a therapist to work through what you've got going on\" but if they were trying to vent to someone in an inner ring that co-opting of the pain will *harm* that person.\n\nAnyone using ring theory to gossip has other issues and is not actually practicing ring theory. Generally people don't share vulnerable feelings like fear and hurt unless they have to.", "\"Do better\", \"nonsense\"? She didn't tell a racist joke on Twitter, her kid is dying. Try some empathy.", "I agree with all of this, I do. But I don't hear OP talking about what the brother wants. And maybe it's more of an ESH, but I don't think OP is innocent", "Only if the BROTHER says that he needs her to back off.\nHe may have cancer but he can still certainly speak for himself", "Op can do what they want with their brother they will never be allowed to tell their mother how to grieve more then likely that poor woman is already co sidering if she even wants to live after her son dies.", "Mom might as well kill herself now for all you assholes in the comment cares because believe once thebrother dies that's probably her plan and op telling g her to bottle up her feelings will just escalate it", "Are you sure?\nIt\u2019s not his brother words , he did not say anything.\n\nMy friend is dying from cancer now. She asked not to be cheerful and happy, she wants our support and saying what it\u2019s shit. Not being positive.", "Yeah I think a lot of people are missing that we are hearing this story from a young guy who is also having a hard time and looking for someone to be angry at. It sounds to me like everyone here is struggling and op has probably made his mum's behaviour sound worse than it is because he's hurting himself. I don't think anyone can be classed an asshole here.", "I have empathy, but for all of them,  not just her.  She is working hard to be the main character in his life, which is going to be very prematurely shortened. If she cannot compose herself and spend the time she has left with him in a positive and fulfilling way, she needs to excuse herself completely from this.", "The poor woman should actually think about what's best for her son rather than what's best for her own psychological state.", "I just take it as he's placing his brother (who is barely and adult)  first. If anyone feels differently that's fine.", "Im going to stop you right fucking there dumb ass. I cant help but reply to this shitty ass comment. I do this all because i dont want my brother killing himself or having a shit quality of life because of her. I already tried taking my life when i had my cancer because of the emotional burden her and others would put on me. She allowed to grieve but she can kindly fuck off if she puts that burden on him.", "OP literally never said she should bottle her feelings. I'm gonna die on the hill that US needs urgently to stop making teenagers read Shakespeare a bunch of times and focus on making them study textual interpretation.", "Sister would know best what he needs.  No one should push their grief on someone else.  An occaisional breakdown is fine, but belaboring him with this is unacceptable.", "I am sure it won't be best for her son if she unalives herself and ops comments are surely going to push her there", "Wait wait. Sister knows best not the person who grew and birthed and raised him?  \n\nEw", "... telling someone to go to therapy is gonna make them kill themselves?", "Happens more often than you realize.  Spread what little empathy you have around and consider how this feels to all involved.", "Losing a child can very well make someone kill themselves and telling them they are grieving the wrong way is just going to push them farther into that depression.", "Oh. Oh I have. \n\nIncluding knowing that the person actually dealing with  the illness can express their needs.", "Make up your mind. One time you say OP is telling her to bottle up. Now that just telling someone to grieve another way is gonna make them resource to suicide. I'm sorry but that's a gigantic leap there. People with life-threatening/life-changing conditions also have an enormous rate of suicide, and guess what doesn't help with depression? Having to handle others' emotional loads about what you are facing yourself. Telling someone to vent in alternative ways, including possibly a therapist, is nothing compared to that.", "Ahh, so you haven\u2019t been there. I have witnessed this very thing. The person being grieved rarely wants to spend their remaining days dealing with that.", "Oh. I have.\n\nI have lost my own mother to the rarest of rare cancers ( metastatic pleomorphic liposarcoma)\n\nI have lost multiple other family members and have to take small chemo doses myself weekly. \n\nSo, again, THE SICK PERSON is perfectly capable feeling their own feelings and expressing them."]}
