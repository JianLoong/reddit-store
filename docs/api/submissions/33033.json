The problem is our mother. She is putting her grief onto my brother and he has to sit around helping people grive the life hes going to lose rather than giving him a great life for how ever long he want. \n\nI understand grieving, i am too but i dont put that on him and its not like i want my mum to go through it alone but my brother is NOT the person to share her greif with. \n\nThe other night i saw out mum just crying and holding him saying she doesnt want to lose him. Afterwards when my brother was asleep i told her she needs to stop grieving for him in fornt of him and if she cant do that she shouldnt at all. That shes making her own dying son deal with her own grief when hes already dealing with his own mortality. She should be supporting him, not the other way around. If she wants support she can talk to me, dad or a therapist but don put your shit on him. \n\nI do think i was a bit harsh, but it comes from a place of frustration. I had my own cancer scare when i was 16 and was stuck dealing with everyone elses grief while i wasnt able to deal with my own shit, i dont want that for my brother. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Im reading all comments and just taking it all in for now, but for people asking if this is also how my brother feels? Yes. Hes always been a shy boy and had trouble expressing his feelings when he doesnt want to hurt others but we have talked about this and he dislikes having to support others but has trouble speaking up. My brother is also low needs on the spectum so can have trouble expressing his own emotions and dealing with others emotions.

I think it is time for your dad to contact your brother's doctor and get your mom into therapy with other parents who are going through the same thing. This way your mother will be able to grieve with other parents who are going through the same thing with their children. Many years ago one of my friends was going through the same thing as your family is going through. She was so filled with despair that she was the same way as you're describing your mom. She would constantly cry and told her daughter that she couldn't leave her and how much she meant her. Her husband was between a rock and a hard place and we suggested that he find a group for her to join through the hospital. The oncologist was able to get her involved in group therapy and it helped more than we imagined it would. She met other parents who were in the same boat, as per se'. Some of their children were in the beginning stages, while others were in long enough that their children were leaving their earthly shells behind. One of the things she learned in this group therapy was to not show her despair or grief in front of her daughter or to her daughter. She learned that the more she did this to her daughter, the more despair her daughter went into as well. They told her to always be loving and positive around her daughter because this is a sign of Hope. Yes, we lost her daughter a few years later, but she still attends therapy and helps other grieving parents to this day. This is what I recommend for you; talk to your dad about getting your mom and the rest of you guys into group therapy through the hospital. I want you to know that you are your brother's hero! You have always been his hero and he is always looked up to you. You will always be his hero ok sunshine xoxo", "I would fully expect my mother to be a mess if I was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

So does your brother.", "NTA.  People seem determined to stain the world with their grief.  This is a personal experience and should not have a significant impact on others.  If mom needs and audience to grieve, she can hire a therapist to help her.\n\nYour brother is very lucky to have you to stand up for him.  It may not be feasible, but if you can take him somewhere he loves away from that sadness, it would be a memory that would last forever.", "When my aunt was told she was terminal she and my uncle decided to knock a few things off the bucket list before she got worse.

I had a health scare and have actually thought about how it'd go with my parents and I think I'd tell them to try and hold it together in front of me because my focus would have to be on myself and not having to prop them up.

I hope you and your brother AND your mom/parents can create some more happy memories until the end. Objectively, you're not wrong in what you said to her, but grief and loss aren't objective.

You are absolutely right in telling her that.  She needs therapy.  He doesn't need to feel guilty on top of everything he's going through.  She needs to hear those words.  She needs to stop putting her grief on him. She is not helping him, she is hurting him.  \n\nI can't imagine the pain she's in right now.  I can't say I'd be any different.  She can't see through her own grief.  You all have precious time together and he should get the most out of his life.  She needs to hold it in and allow him to live as best as he can.  I would also apologize for the hurt, but it needed to be said.", "I agree with you! She needs to be using other resources for emotional support. \n\nThat being said, I'm sure she has no idea how to do this and is incredibly distressed watching her son die in front of her.

You are awesome for trying to protect and support him here.

She needs professional help so she can help him. I don\u2019t know where you are based, but in the UK we have charities like MacMillan, who also provide support to the loved ones of people with cancer.

If I was the one with cancer and no one advocated for me on account of my mum was in the same circle as me, I'd say that's also pretty shitty...\n\nI didn't really get the feeling that OP was mean. If she's anything like my mum, she'd take it poorly however the message was delivered. But I still think it ought to be said.", "> As a parent, the idea of losing my child would be more devastating to me than the idea of dying myself. \n\nWell, I hope you wouldn't say that to your child! \"Sorry that you're dying, but I think I'm sadder than you are! You're not losing a child, just your life!\"\n\n>  Mom is definitely closer to the center than OP\n\nWow. Just, wow. You are being cruel here.", "Sometimes support means reminding them to dump out, not in. \n\nI can't imagine having to live with myself knowing my child spent their last days comforting me instead of finding whatever joys they could.", "Can you imagine being told you probably won't live to see another year, and instead of being able to process it. You have to help other people grieve the fact that you're going to die, and prioritise their grief over yours?\n\nIt's ok for the mum to be upset. But, it's selfish if the mum keeps doing this. It's a shit situation, but she needs to sort herself out quickly and either grieve with others in private or stop until after he's died. \n\nIt's difficult supporting someone who is terminal, but it's doable and if you love someone you'll realise they need you now. You can be a mess later. \n\nI'm not sure where they're based, so don't know if they have any resources they can direct everyone too to help them out.\n\nBut she definitely needs to see someone if this doesn't snap her into action, because when he reaches the point when he's dying. It might not be an easy death, I know the ones I've experienced have been traumatic. If she can be there for him in his final moments it will be good for both of them, otherwise she will struggle with it moving forward.", "I think it is self-indulgent to inflict your mourning on someone with little time left - a child in this situation should not be comforting their mother.\n\nI absolutely can imagine what she is feeling, but loading it onto her dying son is not OK. He is the one dying, not she.", "Maybe it's normal, but that doesn't mean it's healthy.\n\nWhen my brother died, our mum hogged the center circle/ring of grief, when his siblings, fiance and dad could have had equal claim to the center. Let's just say it's changed our family dynamic, and at this point (almost two decades) it's unlikely to recover.\n\nMy mum wasn't an AH, but I still think her \"a mother losing a son is the worst pain imaginable\" attitude was hard on dad. It would have been helpful for all of us to share our grief a little more evenly. I don't completely disagree with \"selfish\".\n\nSo I'm a little sensitive about the \"mum grieves hardest\" trope. Like, looking at the other family funerals that year, I think the message I'd send is \"no single person gets the Monopoly on grief\". because sometimes losing a parent is as hard as losing a long term spouse. It's not always the mum. And when we're talking about ring theory, maybe we need to talk about sharing rings too.\n\nWhile I agree to an extent that dictating how people grieve isn't cool... I do think that advocating for more healthy grieving (like the ring theory) can be beneficial for everyone.", "It is self-indulgent though. She's indulging her own feelings to whatever degree she wants, whenever and however she feels, without any concern for the toll it's taking on the one person who shouldn't have to help her process it. Her behavior may be normal in that a lot of people do it, but it isn't ok, and it is indulging herself and her feelings. She's only thinking about herself, but what it's doing to the son she still has right here and now", "I disagree.  It is self indulgent. selfish. trauma dumping.", "She is selfish.  A parent should put their child's needs first. She isn't even considering them.", "It is absolutely self indulgent to make your dying son your confidante and expect him to provide emotional support while HE IS DYING. It\u2019s called parentification.", ">\"Self-indulgent\" is a horrible choice of words\n\nWhat else would you call it when a mother wants to inflict her sorrow over her son's passing on him WHEN HE'S STILL LIVING?!", "I agree the choice of word might be too heavy. But it is indeed \"selfish\". OP sound like a very supportive brother and son, if it is only once or twice, I doubt that OP would have come to reddit. She is putting her own grief as priority at a time when everyone should come together for the brother. \n\nOf course, caretaker and family require support to, but the least she can do is removing herself from the brother's presence and grief elsewhere", "Why is that his burden?", "The sadness and grief are normal, having the dying child support their mother emotionally is selfish in the extreme.", "They may not be pretty words, but selfish and self-indulgent are accurate for how she is behaving in front of her son. In front of anyone else, it's not, but in front of her son, absolutely she is being selfish and self-indulgent.", "Yes, but it's HER pain, and inflicting it on the child who's already trying to cope with his OWN pain is wrong. Yes, she is hurting, but choosing not to deal with it properly and instead hurting someone else who is himself hurting is a bad choice. OP could have been gentler but at the end of the day it needed to be said.", "So? The brother need to cope with even more, he is facing death sentence. The little time he has to grief, or fulfill his remaining wishes now need to be spent placating his mother.\n\nYes, it is a pain no parent should have to endure, but it is also a pain this young man should not have to endure as well.\n\nI totally understand OP, because it happened with me as well. I had a brother with cancer. I took half year after uni to supposedly help my mom be his caretaker, but I realised that I spent most of the time taking care of my mom. Just a small example, we would brought him for his radiotherapy appointment. She would cry and tell people that she is \"suffering a pain no parent should have to endure\", this includes my brother, and he would just sat there and keep quiet. \n\nTo OP. I totally understand how you feel, but please be reminded that you don't lose focus. Your time should be spent on your brother, not mother.", "Her other child is also grieving and dealing with impending loss. And on top of that has to be the one managing mother's behavior and protecting her brother from it.\nIt would be one thing if she was bursting in tears at random moments and running out of the room. Or just being unable to be there for appointments without being overcome. That would not be ideal but would be completely understandable. \nBut making her son hold her while she cries about his own death????? No. Just no. Even in the midst of a huge emotional turmoil she should know this is not okay", "It may be pain no parent should have to endure, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay to force a dying teenager to endure it, either.  Why should he have to deal with his own feelings about his impending death, his mom\u2019s grief, and probably a metric ton of misplaced guilt for causing his mother so much pain?  She\u2019s an adult; she needs to find a different outlet for her grief, not make it her dying son\u2019s problem.", "Definitely NTA.\nI\u2019ve gone through this when my best friend died from aggressive cancer. While the pain of losing a child is unbearable for a mother, the last and bravest kindness that she can bestow is to not inflict her pain on her dying child. My friend literally had to say goodbye to his mother and ask her not to return. He just wanted to die in peace without shouldering the emotional burden of her grief that he\u2019d been bearing for over a year. \nA mother has every right to feeling grief and pain, but she should put it aside in the presence of her child if that\u2019s what they want. She has the rest of her life to express it.", "Yes, her kid is dying. That kid shouldn't have to shoulder the burden of this mother's grief, too.", "Yes so many misconceptions about autism like they are less empathetic or emotional when my brother and other autistic people ive met are the most empathetic and emotional people ive met but just have trouble expressing it. We definetly need more resorces out there for education on this.", "Check the edit", "OP isn't \"dictating how others grieve\", he's telling this woman to stop emotionally abusing his brother.\n\nIf the only way you can grieve is by hurting other people then, yes, people need to tell you to stop.", "She shouldn't be trauma dumping on her dying son.", "I think it depends on the person. Maybe I would prefer not having time to think I will die. I also think she is suffering a lot, and at the end of the day, she is going to remain alive and won't be able to see her son anymore. I think that is probably what is wrecking her. I also think that she probably doesn't realize she isn't helping.\nProbably some people would like to hear people saying they will miss them and they don't want to lose them. I definitely know people who would be offended if people around were not crying for their impending death. Basically, everyone is different.\n\nI think OP did great. Someone had to advocate for the brother. OP knows his brother doesn't want to deal with the grief of others, so he is helping him by telling others. Now, it just has to sink in for his mother. But if she stops crying and starts acting all \"normal\" in front of him, it is really not a guarantee he will feel better. It may actually be worse. This kind of situation is not easy and doesn't have a simple solution.\n\nI don't see anyone being an ah here. They are all broken. OP has managed to remain a bit cooler, probably because he went through something similar already and because he usually plays this kind of role for his brother. This is the second time their mother feels she is losing a child. That kind of thing doesn't get better with repetition, actually the opposite. She might be severely depressed and might need professional help herself. Her family needs to keep an eye, and if she can't really function, she needs to go to therapy.\n\nPeople calling names to people who are suffering so much is what is actually selfish.\n\nNAH. And I am really sorry you are going through this OP.", "Not to mention she\u2019s the adult in the situation. \n\n18 years old is by no means a child but he is really only an \u201cadult\u201d in the legal sense. He is so, so young to be dealing with all this. He should be picking out colleges and looking towards his future at this age, not saying his goodbyes to everyone he loves. This is still a teenager working with the emotional skill set a teenager would have; death would\u2019ve been no where on the radar. How do you even cope with all of those dreams crashing down at once when you have experienced so little? He\u2019s so strong for taking his mother\u2019s grief on top of this, but he shouldn\u2019t have to do that at all. \n\nIt *is* self-indulgent to throw your grief on someone like that. Your (very valid) feelings do not excuse the salt you\u2019re actively rubbing into their wounds. You can\u2019t control your feelings but you *can* control your reaction, and if you find you cannot, you need to seek professional help and turn to your support systems. That is *your* responsibility as someone with an active role in a dying person\u2019s life. It is not theirs; they can\u2019t control how you act. And it would be offensive to me were she, as the adult and parent of this person, to not take OP\u2019s advice for what it is. OP was direct and it needed to be said. \n\nI always tell people to imagine their pain, except add a whole new level right on to it. You think it hurts you to watch? Imagine what it\u2019s like to go through it yourself *and* know what it looks like. You need to get a hold of yourself for them if you really care about how they spend their last days. Don\u2019t make something that has the opportunity to be peaceful into a traumatic experience. The end of their life doesn\u2019t need to be like that; you have all the time in the world to grieve when they\u2019re actually gone.\n\n\nTL;DR: Feelings don\u2019t expunge responsibility, mom needs to accept help to be there for her son before it\u2019s too late & I\u2019m a little fired up from personal experience, sorry.", "I suspect she can't look at him without simultaneously remembering him being born and the fact that he's going to be taken too soon. Everyone has a threshold.", "It's not okay, you're right, but the point is that grief is not a reflection of her character. For all when know she could be a rational, supportive, selfless Mother every other day, but presently it's blinding her.\n\nJust saying, we don't know in this case so maybe chill on the firm tone. I think it wouldn't be a question if she was usually like this, OP would just know he's NTA.", "As a mom, I cannot imagine it.
