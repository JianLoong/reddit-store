Our friend group has been picking up the pieces ever since. He's doing much better now that he's in therapy, but he's definitely gone through it. \n\nWhat has complicated matters worse is my fianc\u00e9e. It goes without saying that I love her, but she is the definition of a busybody sometimes. My best friend is a very private person. She knows something happened with him, but she doesn't know the details of what that something is. She probably never will. But because she's around me and my friends often as we live in the same house, she hears bits and pieces of the story and presses for more information.\n\nI try to circumvent this as best as I can - for example, I step out of the room for specific phone conversations. But still, it's hard to limit the discussion about it sometimes. If it\u2019s necessary we bring it up and she\u2019s around in person, we\u2019ll refer to the 'Nolan situation' without giving specifics. \n\nNolan will also stop by my place at night when he can't sleep. This doesn't happen all that often - maybe twice a month. He'll text me or call me saying he's outside, I'll go sit with him and maybe smoke a little bit, then he'll head home. I'll wait up until I know he got home safely, then I go back to sleep. My fianc\u00e9e hates this. She claims the phone calls always wake her up - they don't, she just sometimes happen to wake up for the bathroom while I'm outside - and that me not being in bed is alarming.\n\nThis brings us to last night. Nolan stopped by and when I came back inside, my fianc\u00e9e said she was 'putting a stop to it.' She said all the sneaking around is making her paranoid, she doesn't feel like she can properly trust me or be a part of my friend group without knowing the details, and that Nolan needs to stop relying on me so much. I told her that no matter whether we're married, dating, whatever, she will never have any ownership over my friend's trauma, and that she was never going to be able to order me around in regards to it. I also said her comfort was less important than someone\u2019s *actual physical well-being.* She was obviously hurt by this and went to stay with her mom after work today.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: She knows Nolan lost a parent, she doesn\u2019t know the aftermath beyond the statement he had a mental health crisis. Yes, he has specifically asked me not to tell her.\nEDIT 2: This is not something we talk about \u201cconstantly\u201d in front of her. I\u2019m giving examples that have happened over the past year and a half. Also, Nolan sees a therapist. He comes to my place to hang out.", "created_utc": 1677113530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119jlkr/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9e_that_my_friends/", "score": 9768, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You HAVE to realise that the emotional burden your friend is placing on others is negatively impacting your relationship, otherwise you're not going to have one much longer. Your fiance's feelings and fears are legitimate - as you can't seem to empathise with her position, I don't see this turning out well for you unless you listen to her from a place of caring for HER not just Nolan.\n\nYes you love your friend, but I assume you love your girlfriend as well. She is absolutely right that, at this stage, Nolan needs to stop using his friends as his first stop for \"emotional emergency response\" in the middle of the night. Unless it is an emergency (and in which case I'd argue a hospital or whatever your country's usual access point is) is the solution.

It's great that you want to be a supportive friend to Nolan, but the talking in code, shutting her out of conversations, and late night disappearances are really disrespectful, especially when you then get angry at her for being curious about what's happening.\n\nYour place is your fiancee's home as much as yours, and she should feel comfortable there.

I have friends, he has friends but we all consider ourselves mutual friends. \n\nSure there have been things over the years that maybe my friend has told me and didn\u2019t want my husband to know.

Your partner.   And while it's true that it's up to Nolan what he shares and whom he shares it with, it does sound like you're cutting her out of the situation to a degree that is problematic. \n\nYou are not your friend's therapist.   There is no doctor patient privilege.  This is not a job nor is it classified information.   If my SO was frequently getting up late at night because a non mutual friend needed the equivalent of being tucked in to bed multiple times a month, it would eventually begin to bother me if I was not in the loop.\n\nE S H.  <<JUDGEMENT CHANGED, SEE EDIT>> Your fiancee is being overly pushy, your friend is using you as a stand in for (additional) therapy and causing your relationship to have issues because he does not trust your partner (but is fine with demanding your time) and you suck because you're trying to dictate how she feels or reacts (\"I'm not waking her up, she's just saying that\")\n\nEDIT: Upon further response, OP has stated that Nolan's late night visits are not causing him a problem.  Which is pretty telling, because it means he really doesn't care how his fiancee feels about this situation and/or how it is impacting their relationship.  OP, YTA.", "YTA. My sympathy to Nolan, and I agree his requests for privacy and DISCRETION should be respected. But y'all are turning Nolan's grief into a circus and clique, so you can underscore your partner's personality as a busy body.", "I think your heart is in the right place but you are going about this all wrong and your actions are making YTA . \nI have two best friends that I have had for 30 years. They know everything I have gone through including some serious trauma in childhood and adulthood. By extension, I assume their spouses do to. \nI trust them and by extension I trust their spouses.

Do you think she\u2019ll share it with other people? Will she react poorly? Does she have a history of not handling sensitive information well? Because listen - your spouse gets spousal privilege, meaning, it\u2019s expected that you are able to share things with them.

Is that potentially gonna happen here?\u201d Potentially armed or carrying some variation of weaponry. Maybe gonna have a drunken outburst and break shit? \n\nCome on man. This seems a bit intense considering you are obviously a supportive friend to Nolan. Why would you be so against supporting your future life partner with that same energy?!??\n\n(DUH: it\u2019s not even a gender specific thing OF COURSE. But consider there may be a reason Fianc\u00e9e is uncomfortable instead of projecting that she is a \u2018busybody.\u2019)", "OP, what you need to understand is that you are setting precedents with both your fianc\u00e9e and your friend. \n\nI believe in a plurality of healthy relationships. There are lots of ways to structure boundaries and it is your responsibility to do so in a way that works for everyone involved in the situation. \n\nWith Nolan, you are setting the positive precedent that you can be trusted with his information. You also have to understand that you are pattern-setting for the future of your friendship. When he has recovered from his mental health crisis, will he expect to be able to come by at any hour if he is feeling low? It seems likely to me that you and you are establishing the negative precedent that you aren\u2019t willing to set boundaries with him. \n\nWith your fianc\u00e9e, you are pattern-setting for what your marriage is going to be like. You have moved from a healthy pattern of maintaining boundaries on behalf of your friend to actively hiding things from her. You have dismissed her concerns that you are waking her up. How do you know that she isn\u2019t awake when you\u2019re smoking with your friend outside the house?\n\nWhen I started writing this, I was leaning N-A-H. I thought it was simply a case of needing to set boundaries more effectively. But as I think about the way you\u2019ve been treating your fianc\u00e9e, I have to go with YTA. Some of her requests are reasonable and some of them aren\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to set a precedent that 1) you will not draw boundaries with your friends and she can expect them to drop by at any hour; 2) you are willing to actively hide information from her on behalf of other people; and 3) you will dismiss her criticism of those behaviors every time. \n\nIf you were single, the precedents you set with Nolan would be your business only. People set questionable boundaries all the time. But your fianc\u00e9e is affected too, and you need to recognize that this is harming your relationship. \n\nI think you\u2019re a bigger AH than any of us realize, and the more you comment the clearer it will become.", "You have good intentions towards your friend but if she literally doesn't know what's going on and just knows that you're \"sneaking around\" while she's living with you, I can't really blame her.

Like you don\u2019t have to give anything specific but all the secret phone calls, late night visits - you know a lot of people would use these type of excuses when cheating right? It\u2019s not weird for her to be suspicious.", "Not going to pass any judgment here but you might want to start talking to her. The moment you dropped \"never\" into a conversation like that, it's over.

If you aren't ready to do that, then you aren't ready to get married. I'm not saying pull away from your friends. But marriage means your spouse should be #1 over and above everyone else. And tonight, you made it clear to her that she will NEVER be given that place. If I were her, I'd walk. You don't deserve a wife. If you truly want to get married, then make her #1.\n\nAnd your whole friend group are assholes. You're marrying the woman.

I feel so bad for this woman, all of this is going on in her own home and it must make her feel so paranoid.

That is a pretty straightforward thing to want to know. If you don't respect her enough, or you're prioritizing your friend over her, she's gonna be mad. And reasonably.

Obviously the nitty gritty isn\u2019t shared but a \u201cNolan\u2019s struggling tonight, ms. wife, I\u2019ll be on the porch helping him settle out his mind\u201d is REASONABLE. \n\nBasically, you could help alleviate your fianc\u00e9s concerns if you actually wanted to.

This all happened about a year and a half ago, and our friend group has been picking up the pieces ever since. He's doing much better now that he's in therapy, but he's definitely gone through it. \n\nWhat has complicated matters worse is my fianc\u00e9e. It goes without saying that I love her, but she is the definition of a busybody sometimes. My best friend is a very private person. She knows something happened with him, but she doesn't know the details of what that something is. She probably never will. But because she's around me and my friends often as we live in the same house, she hears bits and pieces of the story and presses for more information.\n\nI try to circumvent this as best as I can - for example, I step out of the room for specific phone conversations. But still, it's hard to limit the discussion about it sometimes when it's important to my friends and I have to talk around it occasionally when she's around. Like we'll refer to the 'Nolan situation' without outright saying it, things like that. \n\nNolan will also stop by my place at night when he can't sleep. This doesn't happen all that often - maybe twice a month. He'll text me or call me saying he's outside, I'll go sit with him and maybe smoke a little bit, then he'll head home. I'll wait up until I know he got home safely, then I go back to sleep. My fianc\u00e9e hates this. She claims the phone calls always wake her up - they don't, she just sometimes happen to wake up for the bathroom while I'm outside - and that me not being in bed is alarming.\n\nThis brings us to last night. Nolan stopped by and when I came back inside, my fianc\u00e9e said she was 'putting a stop to it.' She said all the sneaking around is making her paranoid, she doesn't feel like she can properly trust me or be a part of my friend group without knowing the details, and that Nolan needs to stop relying on me so much. I told her that no matter whether we're married, dating, whatever, she will never have any ownership over my friend's trauma, and that she was never going to be able to order me around in regards to it. I also said her comfort was less important than someone\u2019s *actual physical well-being.* She was obviously hurt by this and went to stay with her mom after work today.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hearing about you and your husband and your friends made me smile.", "This. It seems pretty common sense to me that spouses do not keep secrets from each other. Do I go gossiping about my friends to my spouse? No. Do they know that I *can* share all information with my spouse? Yes. And the same is true for them with any information regarding me (that it may be discussed with their spouses). If you\u2019re serious about getting married your fianc\u00e9 is right and needs to be looped in. She\u2019s either your new primary priority or you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.", "Yes, this. It seems like you (op) are treating her like a gf and not a wife. There\u2019s a big difference. I empathize with your position a lot, but it seems like you\u2019re not setting a good tone for your marriage. At the very least, it would probably help if you told her the depth of the trauma (without divulging sensitive details) and why it\u2019s important to you to be there for Nolan. \n\nAlso - seems like she is putting her foot down NOT because she thinks her comfort is more important than Nolan\u2019s physical well-being, but instead because she is hurt at the tone you are setting for marriage. \n\nESH", "This! My friend recently came to me about some fairly serious stuff that she wanted advice on, and she literally asked me not to tell anyone, \u201cexcept (my partner) obviously\u2026 it\u2019s okay if you want to talk about it with him because obviously I\u2019m sure you guys talk about this sort of stuff\u201d lol.

If you truly want to be partners, you can\u2019t be shady or keep heavy secrets from each other! \n\nAlso, your partner can help you help others! Maybe OP\u2019s fiancee could provide OP with a different perspective he hadn\u2019t considered, provide support for OP emotionally when things become heavy for him to bear as Nolan\u2019s friend, or even could relate in a way OP couldn\u2019t\u2026 but they will never know that since he\u2019s choosing to hide everything about his friend\u2019s situation!", "Post makes it sound like the friend never comes inside, he goes outside and they hang out then the friend leaves", "If you read OP's replies, he is VERY big on not breaking the trust of his best buddy Nolan.

Helping Nolan through his trauma is such an integral part of op's life right now and his fiance is being excluded at every turn. He is getting quiet when she enters the room, leaving the room when he calls, and going outside in the middle of the night to talk to him. All of that would hurt anybody's feelings, let alone the person you want to be spending the rest of your life with.\n\nIt really seems like op doesn't really have that many healthy boundaries around his relationship with Nolan.

If you\u2019re willing to go to the mat over this secret what else would you keep secrets?  I hope your fianc\u00e9 really considers this before actually marrying you.  I personally wouldn\u2019t trust someone who found it so hard to be honest.", "Im just not sure what is even being kept from fiance. She knows he lost a parent but doesn't know the aftermath? What aftermath? Isn't the death like the main thing?\n\nIf he means the stuff like \"not being able to sleep\" and \"needing his friends for some serious support\" then yeah she obviously knows it its happening right in front of her.", "This. OP, YTA. My guess is that fianc\u00e9e sees Nolan and her fianc\u00e9 and their friend group hurting and feels helpless and that\u2019s why she\u2019s pushing for info and wants to put a stop to late night random visits.\n\nFianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t need to know all the details but she does need to understand why her fianc\u00e9 is acting the way he is. It\u2019s been a year and a half and her concerns over OP\u2019s suspicious behavior are valid because it can be really jarring to wake up in the middle of the night and not see your partner in bed (was there an accident?) and to have him take phone calls outside and be really secretive (is he cheating? Involved in a shady deal?) and complete refusal to share any of the details of what is happening. He can just say Nolan is still grieving and his process is rough and he still needs our support, and that him coming over at night helps and just explain that you just smoke outside so she doesn\u2019t worry. Being left in the dark hurts.\n\nIncluding the fianc\u00e9e in the support process might also help. For example, even if she doesn\u2019t know all the details, she can be more supportive if she actually knew what she is supporting. You don\u2019t have to disclose what Nolan went through/is going through, but you could tell her what you\u2019re going through. Tell her that it\u2019s important to you to support your friend and how you feel about being in this carer role for the last year and a half. Let her support you. Also, have you guys asked Nolan if it\u2019s okay to disclose some of the details to your fianc\u00e9e? Both Nolan and your fianc\u00e9e will be in your life for a long, long time. Expecting to keep your friend life and home life entirely separate does not seem realistic.\n\nHer behavior might be a result of feeling helpless because clearly she can see something is seriously wrong but she doesn\u2019t know what and doesn\u2019t know how to help. Her saying she wants to put a stop to things might also be a reflection of her concern for you, again, because she doesn\u2019t know how you\u2019re feeling about the whole situation. Giving her space to help support Nolan too may help. For example, her giving a wordless hug when Nolan comes over in the middle of the night might reassure everyone that fianc\u00e9e understands Nolan is going through something and supports him and supports you supporting him. It doesn\u2019t have to be this, specifically, but give her something to do. It sucks feeling helpless when you feel like your partner is going through something, especially if it\u2019s because of another person, no matter how valid. It\u2019s traumatizing in its own way when you are shut out from that process by the person with whom you\u2019ve decided to spend the rest of your life. She doesn\u2019t need to know all the details, but she does need a way to help you. Let her.\n\nNot sure if this matters, but I have lost dear loved ones and required therapy for it too (a partner one year, then a grandmother who raised me the next year, then another grandmother the year after that). I\u2019ve also supported friends as they lost their parents. Death is permanent and leaves permanent scars and is hardest on the person grieving but it\u2019s not easy for our loved ones who see us grieving either. They hurt for us as they see us grieve. Often they will offer support that seems inappropriate and even hurtful. Offer them a way to help you that actually helps, instead. Let her support you, even if she can\u2019t support Nolan directly. Nolan\u2019s grief is not her business, but your processing of Nolan\u2019s grief is, because she\u2019s your partner.", "This. The fact that they talk about it right in front of her using weird codes (\"The Nolan Situation\") is so unbelievably rude. I don't think OP even likes her. So sad.", "I think the fact that he quickly referred to her as a busybody tells us everything we need to know about how much OP values his partner's involvement in his life.

He comes over late at night twice a month, they talk on the phone occasionally, and the friend group are all trying to help him, not just OP. \n\nThis isn't a permanent situation but also, he's not spending every night with this guy or anything. OP's fiance just seems mad because he's not indulging her nosy questions. \n\nAlso this clearly isn't the plan for the rest of his life.

He's being an ass to her, yes, but traumatizing? Get real.", "Agreed. I think OP is kind of being an asshole here. Not for not telling a friend's secret... But for how he's gone about this.

I know that his best friend is a private person and OP doesn't want to overstep boundaries, but will it always be that way about anything? YTA", "Honestly, if it were his mom coming to his house in the middle of the night, people would tell him to reign in the boundaries. You can be a caring person and still have boundaries.

It seems so deliberately secretive from this post. I would not be okay with the situation if I was OPs fiance either. \n\nOn another note, if I were in a similar situation and feeling torn like OP may be feeling, I would probably have to set some boundaries. OP can set some boundaries with his fiance and his friend if he feels the need. However, his fiance is going to (possibly) become his wife one day, and this means they need to be on the SAME page. \n\nThis friend is having a tough time. I get that! He is lucky to have a large support group of friends to help him, and he should be seeking professional help. OP cannot be his friends crutch forever.

At some point he has to start taking responsibility for his own emotional problems. Making it his friends' problems to this extent is not something a good friend would do.

I\u2019m not here to eviscerate you. I wasn\u2019t initially going to comment but I went through and read all your comments and idk. I\u2019m just compelled to say something. I hope you see this. \n\nNolan loses his parent. Goes through his trauma. Trauma affects him deeply and he suffers for it. Which is fine and expected. \n\nYou are worried about your friend, who you\u2019ve known for a Very Long Time, and step up to support him. Still fine. \n\nFianc\u00e9 sees you step up for your friend and, in my opinion, cares about your friend too, even if they don\u2019t know each other that well. (I speak from personal experience \u2014 the people that are important to my SO are important to me because they matter to my SO). She asks after his well-being and gets rebuked. Okay. Not great but still acceptable. When some people go through a devastating life event, they shut down to people not in their circle, so I can understand this. \n\nThe problem arises though, when you \u201cpit\u201d your fianc\u00e9 against your bestie. In your fianc\u00e9\u2019s eyes, you are at your bestie\u2019s beck and call. Not only that, but She\u2019s not allowed to know anything, she\u2019s not allowed to talk or ask about it, she\u2019s basically the only one in the house that isn\u2019t allowed to acknowledge the elephant in the room that /you/ have taken part in creating. That\u2019s\u2026 god, that\u2019s __intensely__ frustrating. All these people talking about this event/situation, and when she walks into a room you all stop or start talking in code? You\u2019re making her feel like an outsider and so, little by little, she\u2019s getting more and more frustrated. \n\nI know you\u2019re not meaning to edge her out of the group, or make her feel like an outsider, or make her feel less important, cuz it honestly sounds like you have the best of intentions, but you have to give a little to get a little. Right now, your fianc\u00e9 feels \u201cless than\u201d. Less important than your friend to you, like her feelings matter less than, like her comfort matters less than, like you love her less than your friend. That may not be the case. I\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt here. \n\nI would, personally, let Nolan know \u201chey, all the secrecy is causing my fianc\u00e9 to be uncomfortable. While I\u2019m not gonna tell her everything, I am gonna give her a high level explanation, just so she knows she doesn\u2019t need to worry. Hope you understand.\u201d\n\nIf he holds you \u2014 not your fianc\u00e9 or even your relationship, but //you// \u2014 in as high regard as you seem to hold him, he\u2019ll be okay with this. He may not *like* it, but he\u2019ll understand that you need to care for your relationship too. \n\nTHEN, I would sit your fianc\u00e9 down face to face, no distractions (tv, cell phone, etc) and have a direct conversation with her. You DEF should acknowledge and apologize for making her feel like an outside. *Acknowledging her feelings will help you so much* because right now, she likely feels like her feelings just don\u2019t matter to you. Then I would explain more than you have. Don\u2019t get into the nitty gritty, but definitely give her more explanation. She doesn\u2019t have to know everything, but she should know some of it, especially since he\u2019s randomly showing up several times a month. Maybe something like:\n\n\u201cI wanted to sit down with you and apologize for shutting you out when it comes to Nolan and what\u2019s going on with him. I know it seems secretive and I know that probably doesn\u2019t make you feel very good. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI\u2019m not going to explain everything to you as it\u2019s not my story to share, but after Nolan lost his dad, he went to a very dark place. I was scared that I was going to lose my best friend to his trauma, and so I wanted to help him any way that I could. He still needs some help, like when he can\u2019t sleep or he\u2019s having a really bad mental day, which is why he comes over. I\u2019ve helped him with legal and power of attorney stuff, too. Its a lot, and I know it\u2019s a lot. Unfortunately, he\u2019s just having a hard time healing after he lost his dad and I\u2019m trying to be there for him like he would be for me, and like I would be for you. I would really appreciate if, going forward, you don\u2019t try to talk to Nolan about it. He\u2019s sensitive about it still and asking him how he\u2019s doing probably is not the best question to ask him. Maybe you can try \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d or \u201chow\u2019s your day been?\u201d instead. I can also try to send you a text or let you know somehow that Nolan\u2019s coming over so that you don\u2019t wake up and wonder where I am. \n\nI know it\u2019s really hard to not be in the know on all of this, so I truly am explaining as best I can; I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t explain more but you are too important to me to lose.\u201d \n\nI truly, truly hope you read this u/holy__trust.

Also, are the partners of the rest of the friend group aware of what happened in detail? If I was the only person that didn't know something in a room where the subject is being eluded to, I'd feel ostracized whether I felt entitled to the information or not. \n\nHas he brought up needing to come hang out when he can't sleep to his therapist? It's nice of you to be a crutch for him right now, but it isn't sustainable forever, and eventually he does need to learn how to self comfort.

I would be annoyed if it kept happening to me when I walked in a room, because honestly I would feel like they think I can't be trusted. He should trust his partner enough to give her the low down while respecting his privacy. There is definitely a middle ground.", "the busybody comment told me everything i needed to know about how this man views women", "This and/but also - OP - you sound like you also are traumatized. I\u2019m guessing Nolan was either suicidal or on that path. You speak to his physical safety being more important than her feeling comfortable. He is physically safe - and if he\u2019s suggesting he will harm himself if you aren\u2019t available - he needs counseling, and though you love him you are not qualified.\n\nHe does need to handle his grief with a broader support group that includes a professional. Maybe you can help him create a safety plan until he has his first appointment. That is a way to support him without feeling responsible for his well being. The safety plan was an important first step on the path to healing after a friend came close to that place.", "Add in OPs comment about the timeline of the relationship and it\u2019s so much worse. They\u2019ve been together only 2 years and he proposed a month before Nolan\u2019s parent died. And apparently Nolan hasn\u2019t even let her get to know him through small talk or anything, she\u2019s been very excluded from anything to do with Nolan. So from her perspective;\n\nYou meet this guy and you two REALLY hit it off. True love at first sight and all that shit. You\u2019re only together for 5 months, and he proposes! Woah! Maybe a little scary to jump straight into it like this, but you love him so you\u2019re so excited! Of course you want to spend the rest of your life with him!\n\nHe has a group of friends who for the most part seem fine with you. But there\u2019s this one guy, Nolan, who just completely ices you out. Doesn\u2019t even seem okay with you asking how work has been. No big deal though\u2026 Not all our partners friends are gonna love us, right? You\u2019re all adults and can handle someone not liking you. You live together so it can be a little awkward when he comes over to visit your fianc\u00e9, but you pull on your big girl pants and deal with it because you love and trust your fianc\u00e9 so much.\n\nBut then a month later, you hear that Nolan\u2019s parent died. Now, whenever you walk into the room when the group is over, they all shush each other and talk in hushed voices. The only thing you ever really hear is them vaguely referring to \u201cthe Nolan situation.\u201d\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 starts taking calls in separate rooms. It seems weird to you because he usually just answers his phone and talks wherever he is\u2026. But, no, you trust him! He says he\u2019s not up to anything so bite down that weird feeling you\u2019re getting and ignore it.\n\nThen in the middle of the night, you wake up to your partner getting a phone call while he was in bed with you. He tries to sneak out of bed without waking you up, but doesn\u2019t realize that the ringer already woke you. You tell yourself it\u2019s nothing. You tell yourself you trust him. You go back to sleep.\n\nBut then a few weeks later, it happens again. This time you can\u2019t seem to fall asleep. All you can think about is the friend group all side eyeing you when you come in the room and shushing each other. You start to worry a little. So you walk out of your room to check on your partner, but you also don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re crazy so you make it look like you\u2019re going to the bathroom. He\u2019s outside, comforting Nolan. You sigh a little sigh of relief because you know Nolan\u2019s parent died recently. So you tell yourself that\u2019s all it is and you go back to bed.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still going on 6 months later. Secret phone calls on the regular, group all hush when she enters the room, \u201cthe Nolan situation\u201d is referenced many times, and your partner is still sneaking out of bed in the middle of the night every couple of weeks. So you finally ask your partner for some info\u2026 And he refuses. He says it\u2019s not his secret to share.\n\n\u2026 But hang on. You already know his parent died. So it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a secret. If \u201cthe Nolan situation\u201d isn\u2019t about his parent having died then what on earth is it? \n\nYou ask around a little\u2026 Everyone is tight lipped. You\u2019re being iced out. You ask Nolan how he\u2019s doing, and he refuses to even engage in a conversation with you. Your partner takes another call in secret and there\u2019s this nagging in your brain that makes you want to know what the hell this situation is.\n\nAnother 6 months go by, and *it\u2019s all still happening.* You feel like you\u2019re going crazy. No one will tell you what the fuck is going on or why your fianc\u00e9 keeps sneaking out in the middle of the night. \n\nYet another 6 months go by and you start to lose it a little. You tell your fianc\u00e9 that this has to stop. A small part of you is still trying to tell yourself that you have no reason not to trust your fianc\u00e9, so you try to draw the line at the night time visits. At least this could cut down your anxiety at night because you know it\u2019s not going to happen anymore. Then maybe you can sleep better and maybe the better sleep will clear your head. But your fianc\u00e9 just tells you that you\u2019re lying, his phone calls definitely aren\u2019t waking you up. So you finally snap. \n\nYour anxiety has just been building and building and building for the last year and a half. You tried to tell yourself that you trust him, but once you actually confront him with the direct impact this is having on your sleep he tries to gaslight you by saying it\u2019s not even waking you up?\n\nYou already know his parent is dead. But \u201cthe Nolan situation\u201d isn\u2019t your partners secret to tell. But your partner will keep sneaking around and the whole friend group will keep icing you out. And to top it all off, your fianc\u00e9 will tell you *you\u2019re lying* when you tell him what this is doing to you? So you do it. You confront it head on and ask Nolan what the hell is going on!\n\nI have anxiety just *writing* that out\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine how anxiety inducing it\u2019s been to **live** through that.", "Right? \"The Nolan situation\"? Patently ridiculous. Clearly it makes OP feel special and important to be part of a secret. It's ridiculous to be so theatrically cloak and dagger about this whole thing, when \"Nolan lost a parent and is going through a hard time right now and needs some additional emotional support from friends,\" is very easy to explain and doesn't in any way violate his privacy.", "The whole thing is so juvenile, especially a) talking in code in front of someone who everyone knows doesn\u2019t know \u201cThe Nolan Situation\u201d and literally lives in the same house and thus cannot distance themself from \u201cThe Nolan Situation\u201d, b) using the phrase \u201cThe Nolan Situation\u201d, and c) this whole \u201cyou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d vibe OP and their friends have toward OP\u2019s alleged future FIANCEE.

I would be insane. It feels like crazy making and a game of keep away.  I think the friend absolutely knows the effect it\u2019s having on her and is reveling in the power he has over OP while alienating fianc\u00e9. I couldn\u2019t imagine how horrible it must feel to have everyone whispering (even the other friends partners) and to be the sole person that isn\u2019t aware of the full situation for A YEAR AND A HALF. Meanwhile she\u2019s the one that is being inconvenienced in the middle of the night and spoken to tersely by Nolan. It\u2019s painful to read - i can\u2019t imagine day it feels like. It\u2019s less about the secret but more about the crazy making behaviors due to OPs lack of boundaries.  \n\nIs it possible that Nolan is in love w you?

Instead, you\u2019re choosing to make her feel like she\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s the kind of behavior that wedges huge, unforgivable crevasses in a relationship. YTA.\n\nEdit: I see OPs edit. My position is unchanged. OP is setting himself up to lose a fianc\u00e9e. Imagine feeling so unwelcome in your own house and in a major situation in your partner\u2019s life that pulls them out of bed at night leaving you to wonder where they went.", "And then being told, essentially, that she\u2019s in the wrong for asking questions about this weird behavior.\n\nYTA hard, OP!", "Also, allowing his friend to come by in the middle of the night to smoke (I assume weed) and then drive home is not helpful.

I would have kicked your whole friend group out or left because I will not be alienated in my own home which is what you have done. You need to let her go or tell her what's going on.

I would also add that OP should have a conversation with Nolan and tell him he will not tolerate Nolan verbally lashing out at his finance. The fianc\u00e9 deserves to be treated with kindness and trauma is no excuse for being abusive towards others.

Partner needs to be in the loop at this point. \n\nOP you and your friend group are purposefully keeping your fiancee out. That's wrong. Plain and simple. Your friend group needs to accept her in on it too. She can come in the group understanding that everything stays within the group and she can't share either. If you can't trust her to keep it in the group, don't marry her. She's not there just for the sex, cleaning house and popping out babies. \n\nEither include her or end the relationship.

He is trying to milk this situation and probably loves the fact that your fianc\u00e9e needs to know things and he has the power to make you deny her. And you enjoy the power rush of being \u2018needed\u2019. Unless she is not trustworthy (in which case why are you with her?), your fianc\u00e9e should RUN, not walk, away from this impending marriage.

This doesn't happen all that often - maybe twice a month.\n\nThis is \"much better\" which tells me that there was a \"much worse\" than showing up twice a month.  I'm also thinking \"can't sleep\" is a bit of a misdirect.  You obviously haven't provided the details but really it can only be two things.  Adding to this the assistance with \"legal issues\" including living will and POA, it really only points to one main thing.\n\nIf it was only \"he feels bad\" and you weren't talking to your fiance about then absolutely Y T A. However, it seems like this is much worse than he \"feels bad\" and \"can't sleep.\" I'm going to guess that it goes beyond wanting to \"get high or drunk sometimes\" as well.  The issues beyond \"feels bad\" and \"can't sleep\" are 100% things you shouldn't talk to other people about without your friend's consent. My friend \"feels bad\" doesn't put a friend group in crisis. This explains the aversion to \"pity.\" It also explains why you are willing to drop and potentially give up everything for him.\n\nThe fact that your fiance hasn't pieced this together tells me she doesn't have training, experience, or skill in managing MH crises.  This is another good reason to not loop her in.\n\nAll that being said here's three things:\n\n1) Your relationship with your fiance doesn't have to be the most important relationship to you.  You get to decide how important any relationship is to you.  You are allowed to keep other peoples' secrets (especially if it's what I think it is), but that means there may be consequences of your decision. You're not likely to be able to have your cake and eat it too.\n\n2) IF the issue isn't that she's gossipy and only that she's nosy, it would likely benefit you and your fiance to get permission to tell her what I suspect is/was happening.  Maybe do something like tell her little by little as long as she doesn't bring it up or act \"weird\" afterwards.\n\n3) Right now you are lying to her. For good reason, but you are lying to her.  I 100% think \"can't sleep\" is a misdirect at best and she knows it (even if she hasn't pieced together why).  Your actions (right or wrong) are causing her to distrust you.  If you aren't more open with her, at the very least, you should acknowledge that her feelings are legitimate and you'll do whatever you can to help her not feel that way. Apologize!\n\nIf you don't accept that your fiance is validly hurt by this, you might lose everyone eventually anyway.

There are harmless secrets - you broke your joint diet with a Snickers one day. But then there are actual secrets - like this. You are demonstrating she does not have a partner, she has a roommate with benefits. When people ask me not to share something, I make it clear that I will honor that, except for my wife. They\u2019re always fine with that, because they understand we are partners and share everything. We also help talk things through. \n\nYour friend does not get to control the secret if it affects your fianc\u00e9e. And it clearly is. If he\u2019s going to come over in the middle of the night, she has a right to know why. It\u2019s her life too. This weird compartmentalism you have going sucks, hard.\n\nAlso, calling her a \u201cbusybody\u201d is fairly classless when you and all your friends are ostentatiously keeping secrets and excluding her, with a side of gaslight.

Normally I take the approach that friendships are just as important as romantic relationships and that it can be beneficial to maintain some boundaries with your partner but yikes...\nIn order to have boundaries you need to clearly communicate them, not just act all cagey and weird. Like literally just giving her some more info like leaving a note saying \"hey Nolans not doing well, we're going for a smoke here's where you can find me\" would probably go a loooong way.\n\nNot to mention there's the whole being convinced she's purposefully trying to spy on him and that she's lying about hearing the ringer. Normally I try to avoid using phrases like gaslighting because I think the internet has warped it so far past its original meaning but man this is like textbook. If I was the fiancee I'd be starting to question my reality a bit. \n\nHer supposed 'snooping' probably started out as genuine concern for her fiance and op has just made it turn into suspicion by being so weird and secretive about it. You don't have to tell her exact details of what your friend is going through but honestly just telling her a little bit more would probably go super far to alleviating some of her concerns, just enough she knows you are actually just helping a friend in a rough spot. Like the way I read ops post, if I was his fiancee, at best I'd assume all his friends hate me and he's planning to leave me, at worst I'd assume he was either cheating or involved in something illegal or dangerous. \n\nOn a related note, you and Nolan probably need counseling. Losing a family member alone can be traumatic and while I can appreciate you trying to be there for your friend, it sounds like it's coming at the cost of your own mental health. You're burning the candle at both ends and somethings gotta change man", "Nolan is his life partner", "More like a very, very codependent relationship, I suspect. Unfortunately that puts OP's poor fiancee in a lousy position - she's excluded from what has become a significant part of OP's life, although he doubtless expects her to be available to him for whatever it is he needs from her. Which sounds like absolute hell for the fiancee. Really, OP needs to end this engagement, eat the cost of breaking the lease on the house if it's leased, or else buy out his fiancee's share of the equity (assuming she wants to leave the house), and figure out what he thinks a marital partnership is before entering into one. Because right now he is prioritizing the wrong person. \n\nOf course, if he ends this engagement that means the end of, I don't know, someone to cook for him (assuming she does most of the cooking), help keep the house tidy, someone to share expenses, someone to listen to HIM when he's had a rough day at the office, easy access to sex - in other words, the sort of things a person gets from an intimate relationship. OP clearly doesn't want to give that up, even though his behavior regarding Nolan is damaging the relationship for his fiancee.

I think some people use grief as an excuse to be rude and do whatever they want. I read a lot of the comments and I still don't get why is this situation such a HUGE mystery?

She should know everything. I hate to say it but I have been through a similar incident where a good friend went through some stuff about the same time I proposed. He literally sucked the life out of me and made me choose using his trauma as an excuse.

I feel so bad for this poor lady.", "OP reminds me of the similar but different type who will set *his loved ones* on fire to keep someone else warm, tbh. Like yeah the firesetter is damaging themselves, but this screams of that super specific type of person who neglects their immediate loved ones and often demands sacrifices of them for everyone but their immediate nuclear family.

My (male) friend and I would quite literally turn up on each other's doorsteps at 1,2,3am, (or at each other's windows). This friendship went on for around a year.

Because driving to someone's house in the middle of the night twice a month isn't sustainable.  Maybe on occasion, but not as a regular habit.  He needs to find a better of managing his issues.
