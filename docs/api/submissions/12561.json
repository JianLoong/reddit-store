But we respect it when someone does, and those that don't are assholes. Teachers especially shouldn't give nicknames when the student has corrected it.\n\nOne thing: unless you're actually her guardian the administrators may refuse to talk to you. You might write something up for your parents to send.", "100% you are NTA.  You've been gracious and kind to politely correct the teacher. She has no right to shorten or change your sister's name to something it's not.  I'd be mad as hell if that was my sister or child. Stick to your guns on this....your sister has a right to be valued by her given name.", "NTA if your sis likes being called Meg it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal but she thinks it\u2019s weird and it sounds like you\u2019ll be a great big sis for stepping up for her.

It needs to be addressed.", "I know of a teacher who wanted to change the spelling of a kid's name because the teacher could not explain it phonetically to the other students. The name was MHARI which, in her case, was pronounced VARI. Instead of seeing a chance to explain there are other languages in the world, the teacher thought changing her name was a better solution. Idiotic. Same goes for this teacher. You should definitely speak to the teacher about using your daughter's correct name. If she argues with you, take it to the principal. Put your concerns in writing, too. You can do this without being aggressive about it. Just be assertive, calm and clear that using the wrong name is not acceptable. The teacher may not respond well given that she's made no attempt to use the right name so far, but it's your obligation to stand up for your child.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour sister is not comfortable with her name being shortened or pronounced as Megan. I myself don't know how to pronounce Meghna, but it IS HER NAME and the school should be accomodating her in that regard (talking about the bare minimum here). Standing up for her will teach you sister a very valuable lesson about boundaries and how it is not appropriate for anybody to overstep and also that it is okay to defend your boundaries towards others.\n\nI had a classmate with the last name \"Nguyen\" and when one of my teachers heard the correct pronounciation from him the first time she chuckled and asked him to reapeat it a couple of times. Always trying to get the right pronounciation down but also chuckling. It made me cringe so hard and I felt for him so much. \n\nYour sister can be very lucky to have a role model such as you. Don't be shy to stand in for the mental wellbeing of yourself or your loved ones", "NTA she should be addressed by her name but out of curiosity why did you name your sister and why are you taking the parental role?", "NTA at all. The teacher should absolutely be using the right name. This is terrible. I'm so sorry.", "YWNBTA. Call that principal.   \n\n\nYour sister's teacher is being (i hope unconsciously) racist. It helps to have an ally when discussing this stuff. You do need to advocate for children. She's only a 4th grader. She's learning from watching you. Watching you stand up for her will help her learn to stand up for herself.  \n\n\nI live in the US too. This stuff is not normal or OK by our standards. Not even a little.", "NTA.\n\nIf the teacher gets in trouble so be it because your sister has already told her she wants to be called by her proper first name. Just because the teacher is lazy doesn't mean you shouldn't have a talk with the principal about this. Your sister has a right to be addressed the way she wishes to be addressed. It unfortunately won't be the last time this happens, & your support will go a long way to helping her stand up for herself on her own in the future. \n\nIf the teacher is smart she will back down after the meeting. If not, see about getting your sister moved to a different class.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you handle the school stuff and that your parents feel the same as you do...\n\nDefinitely speak to the school administration. You've already spoken to the teacher, so that's the next step. \n\nWhat she's doing is entirely inappropriate.", "Fellow South Asian here. There is no way you could be the AH in this situation.

This is covered in first year education classes at most colleges. We are taught that names are important, that we should learn them and how to spell and pronounce them properly, and we should only use nicknames or alternate names when requested by the student. \n\nI would email the teacher and be polite but firm. Something like this: \n\nI'm X, Meghna's older sister. As you are probably aware, my family is originally from South Asia. My sister's full name is the name of a river in Bangladesh, and it is very meaningful to her and to our family. She does not like having it shortened or Americanized, but since she is only 9, she doesn't feel comfortable correcting an authority figure. Since you have started calling her Meg, many of the other students are also. Please help her feel more accepted by calling her by her proper name and encouraging your other students to as well.

My parents let me keep this name since they liked it too. It's quite common in my culture for other family members to give a name/nickname to a newborn child.

It made sense when I was young, 30 years ago. It does not make sense any more. This teacher absolutely needs to do better.  Please fight for your sister to be addressed properly. It\u2019s okay for some mispronunciation due to accent or whatever, but anglicizing her name without her actually wanting to be referred to that way is quite frankly racist and disgusting.", " NTA.

It is completely inappropriate for a teacher to essentially rename your sister. It also screams racism. The teacher should absolutely spell the name correctly and call your sibling her actual name.", "NTA. Everyone deserves to be called a name that makes them happy and comfortable. Whether that's their full legal name, a nick name, middle name, last name, or something they just picked out. The teacher is disrespectful in choosing to call your sister by a nickname she hasn't agreed to, and is blatantly being an asshole by continuing to mess up her name on purpose after being corrected.

Please call. The teacher is being rude and lazy. Learning new names can be tricky depending on pronunciation. However that's no excuse. When I learn a name and I struggle with it I  work on it until I get it right. It's a basic act of respect. If someone is having a hard time all it takes is an apology and some effort to correct the issue. Don't let this slide. It's more then just a name, it's about teaching your sister she deserves to be respected.", "NTA teachers should just stick to the name written on the student profile or what the student says you can call them. Teachers don't even need a reason to call students by nicknames like Meg or Megs, they're not her friend, and she's said she doesn't like those names for her. Even in the case of a student having a name that can be smaller without being a nickname, like Johnathan, if that's in his records, unless he says, \"I go by John, actually.\" that teacher should keep calling him Johnathan.", "NTA\n\nReminds me of how the teachers at my high school (in Norway) REFUSED to learn how to pronounce a french exchange student's name and just boldly declared that he was no longer Pierre, but Per. \\*facepalm\\*\n\nOh and the amount of teachers who have gone \"oh your name is Ingrid? I thought it was Inger! I had a favourite student named Inger!/I had a relative named Inger! Lovely girl! I just can't seem to remember you're not also Inger! How will I ever remember!? Isn't that funny?!\" mmm. ok. cool story, teacher, but that's still not my name??", "This. People deserve to be called the name they go by and not what someone thinks they should be called. At the very least the teacher could have asked if there was a short form she was okay with going by rather than just deciding it would be Meg.", "Happy cake day!", "The fact that the sis seems to hate it is a huge point for me. \n\nYou see stories occasionally where a parent finds out their kid is going by a different name that they picked in school and they make a huge stink about it.

That damn birth certificate caused me nothing but problems when trying to get my driver's license and even renewing it has been a pain in the ass because there are no procedures in place for an amended birth certificate due to a misspelling (i.e., no court order affirming a name change because my name wasn't changed).", "I absolutely get that.
