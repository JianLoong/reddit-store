The only consistent argument in our relationship is about her sleeping habits. Important for context, she isn\u2019t lazy - she has a busy job, busy social life, goes to the gym, and we often do things together. \n\nMy issue is we regularly disagree with her sleeping pattern, when we were at university it was fine. Now it\u2019s just bizarre. Here are some examples\n- She goes to bed around 11pm gets up at 7am (normal amount of sleep)\n- Any journey (plane, car journey, train if she is not travelling alone) she will have a \u2018quick nap\u2019 regardless of how long the journey is she will sleep most of it. \n- Regularly returns from work and has a nap for an hour \n- Works from home two days a week and uses her lunch hour to sleep \n- Gets up very late every weekend regardless of what time she\u2019s gone to sleep, and will regularly also nap \n\nI understand she may be tired, and I have understood this over the years. My AITA is that this has been bothering me for some time which I have mentioned. Yesterday we returned home from a trip away (I do all the driving as she only drives roads she knows, I also don\u2019t mind). It was a 6hr journey I\u2019d also made on Friday. I asked her to please not sleep the entire time as it would be good to chat etc. 5 mins in, she is asleep. I woke her up when we arrived home.

My main question would have been this:  why didn't you wake her up earlier?  Say 3 hours in?\n\nAs far as your failed attempt to make her look like she sleeps too much... seems to me she really values her sleep and gets a healthy amount.  Yeah maybe more than some, but taking naps and sleeping in on weekends.  Gosh!  the horrors!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA - you let her sleep 6 hours when you could have woken her up.

She may have an undiagnosed auto-immune disorder which causes fatigue (this is how I discovered my auto-immune disorder) and she has a hard time staying alert.

You're acting like she's sleeping to spite you, which is ridiculous. 11pm-7am in bed =/= 8 hours of sleep.

She sleeps less than eight hours a night during work days and catches up a bit during the weekend or by taking a handful naps. Its not that outrageous. YTA.", "YTA. You said it yourself, she has a busy life and may be tired. Why does she have to stay awake just because you want her to?", "YTA for everything but the car ride thing. It\u2019s very frustrating to drive a road-trip with someone who is asleep the whole time unless they can sleep through music/podcasts being played. I can barely go 3-4 hours without road hypnosis making me nod off, and even if I play podcasts or music it doesn\u2019t keep you awake as well as a conversation does. It would probably be reasonable in the future to be like \u201ccan I wake you up after a few hours? It helps me stay awake on the road and otherwise I\u2019m going to have to stop more often or pass the driving to you anyways.\u201d I guess the only reason I could think it might not be a good idea to ask her to be awake on roadtrips is if she gets carsick. \n\nHowever I don\u2019t see how her naps impact you? You say she still has all her shit together, unless her napping is putting more of the household work on you or something I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so bad. Is it just that you wish you could nap like that or you don\u2019t get enough sleep? Or that you associate naps with laziness?", "Why does it bother you so much? She\u2019s clearly being functional. If the woman wants to nap, let her nap!", "YTA. Let me get this straight, she has a busy job, rich social life, hitting the gym regulary and also spending seemingly enough time with you and you complain that she naps? Like dude, I just get tired from thinking about doing anything after work.   \n\n\nLike others have said, it could be a medical issue of some kind, or maybe her body just needs more sleep to really regenerate. Maybe even her night sleep is not of \"high quality\".   \nThe title of your post makes it seem like she's some modern version of Sleeping Beauty. Exagerration much dude.", "Awwww she\u2019s a napping princess\u2026 YTA", "YTA just let her sleep. Studies have actually shown that women just generally need more sleep than men do.", "I get motion sickness when traveling, but it doesn\u2019t result in vomiting, it results in sleeping. I have fought through the sleep a couple of times, and those are the times my parents have ended up pulled over on the side of the highway while I puked my guts out. \n\nShe spends 8 hours in bed which is awesome, but she is likely only accumulating about 7 hours of sleep from that. A couple of naps during the day would be absolutely normal. It may be more helpful for her to work through her lunch hour, finish work an hour earlier, and take a single extended nap in the afternoon as this would provided her with a full sleep cycle. Most humans need 5-6 full sleep cycles a day lasting 1.5 hours each. \n\nIf she is not neglecting her responsibilities in favor of sleep, then she is doing nothing wrong here. This is just her sleep schedule. It is really damaging to feel judged or be shamed for sleeping. I grew up in a home where naps weren\u2019t allowed and I was woken up whenever my father deemed it \u201ctime\u201d to wake up. My relationship with sleep was complicated. Sleep is essential for so many things. Best not to make someone feel bad for taking care of their essential needs.\n\nWere you shamed for your sleep habits at all growing up? It could explain why this bothers you. \n\nYTA", "YTA - you called her selfish, rather than trying to understand why she \"sleeps so much\". If she's sleeping so much, why aren't you concerned?\nIs she depressed? Does she have sleep apnea? Hormones? other medical conditions?", "YTA  the quality of the sleep matters as much if not more than the quantity. Even if she is \"sleeping too much\" the concern would be to see if there is an underlying medical issue or complaints that she's not pulling her own weight when it comes to household chores, not that she's selfish for catching a nap when she can.\n\nAlso, there are [benefits to napping](https://www.thensf.org/the-benefits-of-napping/) that you're completely disregarding", "YTA.  If she's taking care of everything that needs done, it's really none of your fucking business if she chooses to sleep in her downtime.", "YTA\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem excessive at all (your examples).\n\nIf she was sleeping away ANY free time she had, I\u2019d say it was a cause for concern and that she might want to ask a doctor for their opinion. \nBut this isn\u2019t bad at all.", "YTA it is selfish to let this be the thing that bothers you. Sounds like a medical condition. Make her feel supported by urging her to get it checked out and don\u2019t make her feel bad for being tired. Everyone has a different need for sleep.

I sleep similarly to your girlfriend and I have medical issues that necessitate that for me. Don\u2019t get mad at her for sleeping so much, there could be a good, justifiable reason for it. YTA.", "YTA. Some people just need more sleep. You're being a rude boyfriend for calling her selfish. Like what? She's literally just sleeping. I get driving alone is awful, but some people just fall asleep real easy in a car. I think you should just expect that if you're driving in a car, your gf won't be awake during the trip, so plan around it like making a playlist or getting a podcast ready", "YTA. Some people just struggle with staying awake.\n\nI've got narcolepsy, and riding passenger in a moving vehicle exacerbates it so hard. Like I can sleep during an entire 10 hour car trip, just out, even after 8 hours of sleep. Then I can get out of the car, crawl into bed, and sleep a whole night's sleep. And get back in the car, and sleep another 5 hours the next day.\n\nShe isn't sleeping to piss you off. She's probably not able to stay awake.", "YTA. Omg if my boyfriend said this to me I think I\u2019d cry. I always worry that I sleep to much especially\nCause I\u2019m anemic and pregnant. But when you\u2019re tired it\u2019s hard too stay awake, she might find it hard to stay awake plus she works a lot so she\u2019s bound to be tired. Everyone I know wakes up late on the weekend. I suffer w thyroid and anemia and it\u2019s so hard to stay awake she might even have a deficiency in something to sleep so much. It\u2019s important that she sleeps. From what u put she dosent sleep a crazily amount just normal", "YTA\n\nAs someone with Narcolepsy, have you considered she may have a sleep disorder? Honestly the sleep schedule you mentioned sounds a lot like mine, even when medicated, and my narcolepsy is a pretty severe case.\n\nI sleep from 8 or 9 pm to 6 am. \nI go to work, and take a nap during my lunch period.\nI get home, and take another nap. \nI cannot stay awake as a passenger in a vehicle. Not possible. No matter how hard I try.", "YTA \n\nAnother thing to consider is that there could be a non-medical underlying condition, like ADHD. \nA lot of people (particularly women) with ADHD can end up with a full schedule that helps keep them motivated and on top of things so symptoms are barely visible, but they often end up with their brain being so fatigued they need a nap.\n\nBefore I got diagnosed and medicated I was taking a half hour nap on the hard floor of my office at work on my lunch breaks every day because my brain would just short circuit and I would need to. Started meds, and didn't even think about the naps for weeks until I realised I hadn't had one since. Still haven't \ud83e\udd72\n\nThere's so many reasons that this could be happening but even if it's just that she likes napping, that's ok.\nI get that it can be frustrating to have the passenger sleep heaps on a long drive but she's not intentionally falling asleep in the car, and based on your agreement you should have just woken her up. Have some conversation/listen to something together/play a game or something to keep her brain active and awake if you want her to stay awake.", "YTA\n\nLet me get this straight: you're upset because your girlfriend likes to nap? Are you serious?", "YTA. Come at her from a place of concern. Talk about the why. Don't call her selfish because you're wanting to be a chatty cathy", "YTA \n\nWait is that not the norm?", "Some people aren\u2019t built to \u201cgrind\u201d 24/7 ... I take a nap when I need to defrag my brain and restore my energy for the rest of what I have going on; which sounds to be about as much as your girlfriend. \n\nIt might be what keeps her in good spirits/sane; hate on her naps at your own risk \ud83d\ude02", "Yta. Get a job stay away from her", "YTA. The motion of a car or other transportation lulls her to sleep. She can\u2019t change that. And she needs more sleep than you do. That\u2019s just the way she is. \n\nListen to a podcast or something and stop expecting her to change a body function and basic need just because it\u2019s different from you.", "YTA.  \n\nThe one thing that sounds weird/annoying is the sleeping in late at the weekend.  My ex did that and I felt like I wasted the whole weekend's daylight hours waiting.  If I had gone out and done something, then we wouldn't have seen each other.  \n\nBut the other stuff--falling asleep in the car, having a quick nap--is pretty normal.  I fall asleep the instant a movie begins or the seatbelt clicks shut.  It's not something I can help.  It's just how some of us are.  The same people who complain about my dozing off won't do the activities I enjoy (hiking up mountains, digging gardens, lifting weights, walking all over the city, etc), so it works both ways.  \n\nAnyway, your girlfriend reminds me of me.  Maybe she wears herself out during the day and feels relaxed and safe enough around you that she can doze off.  I don't feel that comfortable around most people.  Not sure if she's the same.\n\nOne thing you could try is figuring out if there's anything you could help her with to help her be less busy.  For example, if she does most of the housework, start doing more yourself.  You might end up joining her asleep!\n\nThe bottom line is that you'll probably have to live with this or get a new girlfriend.", "Umm, YTA, sleeping is not a choice, if she falls asleep it is because she probably needs it.\nAlso, as adults need 7-9 hours of sleep a day she is still well within the normal spectrum, if she displays no other signs of illness. \n\nIt is also normal to sleep in late during the weekend, unless we're talking waking up in the deep PMs or so.", "YTA\n\nPeople need varying amounts of sleep. And it sounds like overnight plus naps is an appropriate amount. There have been studies that show that biphasic sleep is quite beneficial.\n\nAs for, what it seems is the real issue you have, \"Carcolepsy\" is a real phenomenon. It's also called \"Highway Hypnosis\". But, it equates to one's inability to stay awake while a passenger.

Yes, YTA for trying to gatekeep a basic human body requirement.", "YTA. Though I do understand your wanting someone to chat with while you're doing the hard work of driving, she may not have 100% control over falling asleep when in the car.\n\nFor the rest, you're way too judgmental about her sleeping habits. Hers sound pretty normal to me.", "Yta - have you considered that her sleep patterns are normal and yours are not? Or have you considered she might have something medically wrong? Have you considered that car rides make her sleepy? You are just judging without asking the right questions.", "YTA. Soooo\u2026 she sleeps? I don\u2019t see what the issue is here. The only issue you\u2019ve mentioned is that she slept during the 6 hour drive and you wanted to chat. Why didn\u2019t you just wake her up? She was apologetic when you got home so it sounds like she wouldn\u2019t have minded you waking up her up.", "YTA. I can drive to Las Vegas perfectly fine but if I\u2019m in the passenger seat , I will fall asleep, especially with air conditioning on. Weird of you to be so mad at something that happens naturally", "YTA. People sleep/nap because they need to sleep/nap to regain energy and refresh their brain so they can continue with day.

It's somewhat natural to fall asleep in the car as the passenger. \n\nI also don't think you have a right to be angry about her other sleep habits, however, I wonder if she's suffering from depression or other mental health issues (like anxiety / burnout) with her job or otherwise.

The only consistent argument in our relationship is about her sleeping habits. Important for context, she isn\u2019t lazy - she has a busy job, busy social life, goes to the gym, and we often do things together. \n\nMy issue is we regularly disagree with her sleeping pattern, when we were at university it was fine. Now it\u2019s just bizarre. Here are some examples\n- She goes to bed around 11pm gets up at 7am (normal amount of sleep)\n- Any journey (plane, car journey, train if she is not travelling alone) she will have a \u2018quick nap\u2019 regardless of how long the journey is she will sleep most of it. \n- Regularly returns from work and has a nap for an hour \n- Works from home two days a week and uses her lunch hour to sleep \n- Gets up very late every weekend regardless of what time she\u2019s gone to sleep, and will regularly also nap \n\nI understand she may be tired, and I have understood this over the years. My AITA is that this has been bothering me for some time which I have mentioned. Yesterday we returned home from a trip away (I do all the driving as she only drives roads she knows, I also don\u2019t mind). It was a 6hr journey I\u2019d also made on Friday. I asked her to please not sleep the entire time as it would be good to chat etc. 5 mins in, she is asleep. I woke her up when we arrived home.

Women often require more sleep due to our hormones changing monthly and other physical factors, as well as mental factors. Also, those with higher mental functions and IQs tend to sleep more. Einstein was notorious for sleeping 13hrs a day and napping daily. Mensa places my IQ at 136, far above anyone in my family, and since I was a child, I have slept far more than 8hrs. When I was younger 11-13hrs with reg. naps & now I'm 9-10... and I'm borderline hyperactive. When I'm awake,  I'm AWAKE. My mind is at 1000 miles per hour the moment my eyes open; no coffee (ever) or stimuli.

Emotional stress knocks me out, cars, traveling, others fighting; lots of factors to consider in another's sleep. Long story long, here's what I suggest to help, cause why offer a problem with no solution(s), right? Since you are already aware of her sleeping patterns,  you might need to reconfigure how you travel. Turn long trips into short local ones,  stimulate her brain not in just conversation to stay awake, instead a game you can play while driving to keep her mind engaged by forcing her to use different neuron pathways in the brain. Or, I hate to say this one (nvm, I don't hate saying this), but push her out of her comfort zone into driving more to stay engaged. I mean just driving locally to feel safe? We don't grow if we dont push ourselves, come on girl. What happens if technology is destroyed, she won't know where she is ever. I'm more concerned with that part than her sleeping,  haha.", "YTA let her sleep!", "Maybe she's depressed.
