Which is weird... \n\nI'm also not seeing how he was gaslighting you about you saying \"What if I wanted to bring a friend?\" If anything, it sounds to me like you were trying to trap him into saying you couldn't bring a friend but he could and then use it against him to prove a point.\n\nEither way, I hope you all settle this and I hope his friend and you guys have a Merry Christmas.

It's fine to want to have a specific kind of holiday. Everyone is allowed to have their own desires, but being an adult is about balancing personal wants against the bigger picture.

Instead of working with your partner to make both of your wants possible, you immediately told him that his plans have less value than yours. Why wouldn't it be possible to split the day? Even a short dinner would probably be enough to let your partner show his friend that he isn't alone. If this person is important to you then you have to learn to work with each other, not against each other. It should never be your plans vs my plans.", "YTA. You see him at home everyday. On the holiday, he wants to do a nice thing for someone. When you said, \"What if I want to invite a friend of mine?\" and he *very reasonably* said that would be fine, you... called it gaslighting?

To want to spend Christmas with just the two of you is fine, but you\u2019re a real piece of work on the rest of it. Just go visit your family if that\u2019s what you want.", "If my boyfriend did this, I would be greatly touched by his consideration and selflessness.  What a catch.  Instant turn on.

That said, it does seem like a bit of an over reaction. \n\nI highly doubt that your boyfriend is suggesting Nico spend the whole entire day with you . Plan for him to come over in the afternoon/evening and you and your bf can still spend some quality time together in the morning.

That's a really strong accusation to make against someone.", "YTA\n\nThe fact you said you\u2019d leave to give them more \u201cprivacy\u201d is telling. \n\nIs your BF also part of LQBTQ+ community? Are you worried Nico is coming over for Festive Frollicks?", "YTA for multiple reasons: your response asking, what if I invite a friend was a thinly veiled threat and a temper tantrum; you then double-downed on your tantrum by actually threatening to spend Christmas elsewhere; and your accusations of gaslighting are misdirected. It is you that is gaslighting him by making it seem like he is guilting you into this. \n\nHe is correct, you are being selfish. This is something your partner wants, and you are being toxic.", "YTA, you are using the gaslighting to justify the fact that you are being unreasonable and being called out for it. I get the fact that you want to spend Christmas only with your husband, however this time of the year is rough for some and you know empathetic people like your husband tries to help. If you don't want to receive and stranger in your house in Christmas is ok but don't expect tons of sympathy for that attitude.", "YTA. You sound exhausting. Also, look up the definition of gaslighting, bc how your using it is not it", "gaslighting lmao", "Yta and don\u2019t know what gaslighting means. I\u2019m also part of a home-loving introvert couple who would love an intimate Christmas with my hubby sans family but my heart would feel bad if he told me someone would be alone on Christmas. It\u2019s the holidays, open your heart and home to your bfs friend.", "YTA, get a dictionary.", "Unless you think that your BF is sleeping with Nico, I think that you should invite Nico over even for a couple of hours for dinner or Christmas lunch. I personally feel that a few hours would be a nice compromise. Then you and your BF can just relax alone after. Your BF and you have done something nice for Nico, he\u2019s gotten a nice lunch/dinner and some great company at a time he is struggling. You could even invite a few other friends over, maybe a potential blind date for Nico.", "This is so funny\n\nYTA\n\nYour boyfriend is doing a nice thing. \n\nAs everyone has already said you have no idea what gaslighting means. Chucking it around all over the place, look it up!", "YTA, Christmas is a feast, it's a time to be together. if it will be weird to have only your husband's friend, invite someone else. Make Merry! Have fun! Relax!", "YtA, hopefully you get to see what it\u2019s like to be disowned by everyone you love and only have 1 friend that\u2019s willing to invite you over. Who knows, this might the hill that leads you there", "YTA.  Christmas for most people (of course not all , before  everyone piles on saying Christmas is for being alone, your mileage may vary). is getting together with friends and family.   Inviting someone over for a meal and a little hanging out shouldn\u2019t ruin your whole holiday and it sounds like this friend could use some friends at the holiday time.\n \nYou are over-reacting in my opinion as well.  I mean there\u2019s a whole weekend there for you to be \u201clovely and intimate\u201d or whatever you\u2019re imagining it will be. A few hours celebrating with someone else shouldn\u2019t blow up your entire world and it feels like your fianc\u00e9 is throwing a lifeline to his friend and you should respect that.", "YTA and you have no idea what gaslighting is. Please get a grip on reality. Your boyfriend very accurately describing your behavior and telling you he\u2019s fine with you inviting a friend is not even close to gaslighting. \n\nIf you want to talk about who is being shitty in the argument maybe look inwards. You tried to have a little \u201cgotcha\u201d moment by bringing up inviting a friend and it didn\u2019t work out when your boyfriend was fine with it. That\u2019s not gaslighting. Here, I [googled](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gaslighting?amp) it for you so you can stop accusing your totally normal and very patient sounding partner of being abusive online to millions of strangers. \n\nDoes he know you do that by the way?", "Lol, you clearly don\u2019t know what gaslighting means. What your boyfriend is doing is called \u201cbeing a good person and offering alternate solutions.\u201d YTA.", "I'm gonna have to say YTA, if it's one-on-one time you want then say that and come to a compromise. Like the friend can come over, but is expected to leave at a specific time so you two can spend quality time together for the holiday. This man is your partners good friend, and he's right to say he's not a stranger to him.\n\nMaybe instead of seeing this as a negative experience, you should see it as an opportunity to get to know someone who is obviously important to your partner.\n\nEdit: gaslighting involves much worse things than what you're talking about here and is abusive. Please don't accuse people of abuse when they are not guilty of it.\n\n2nd edit: now that I think about it more, you accusing your partner of gaslighting you, is you gaslighting him...you're trying to make him think he's doing something he clearly isn't in order to manipulate him to get what you want.", "Yta. Your bf clearly speaks highly of his friend and that should be good enough for you.\n\nIt's Christmas; don't be a humbug. You'll get to know his friend and maybe even gain a friend yourself.\n\nOr, turn it into a Hallmark movie. If this friend is single, invite someone else who is single to Christmas and set them up together. Idk how, but apparently that saves Christmas in every Hallmark movie. Kidding, mostly.", "I may be in the minority but NAH. Ignoring the fact you don\u2019t know what gaslighting is, i can see why you\u2019d want a mellow holiday and not bring someone you don\u2019t know to your home and just want to spend it with your bf. But your bf is not the AH for wanting to help his friend and since you don\u2019t know nico we don\u2019t know how he is. He may be a great guy \n\nI\u2019ve had my bil \u2018s friend over for Xmas I didn\u2019t know when I was 14 and he was in his 20s he was a creep and spent the whole time hitting on me, trying to get me drinks and get me alone. It made the holiday hell", "YTA - \" give you two some more privacy \" ? bUt I HAve Gay blah blah blah \n\nJust because he is gay does not mean he is after your man, the internalised weird jealousy and homophobia is strong here .\n\nPlus side - you have just shown your partner who you are , and who you are is a person that gives zero shits about anyone other than yourself , and thinks because someone is gay that they are a threat. Nicely done", "YTA\n\nHe's literally not gaslighting you. Invite a friend to Christmas.", "As someone very wise once said.\n\n\"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means\"\n\nYTA", "NTA for not wanting to spend Christmas with a complete stranger. \n\nYTA for trying to say your bf gaslit you.", "He did not gas light you.. You \u201cthreatened\u201d to also invite a friend and it backfired as he supported that decision and you didn\u2019t like it\u2026 That\u2019s like a self gas light if anything\u2026 YTA.", "OP it's obvious you've never been alone at Christmas. I can tell you from experience it can be very lonely. \n\nGood for you that you haven't had the misfortune to lose loved ones, fall on hard times, find yourself geographically distant or been hit by one of the many other twists and turns of fate that life can bring. Try to have some compassion and kindness for people that are having a different life experience. YTA", "NTA, it seems crazy to me that your boyfriend has a close friend of 3 years, and you've never met him. I would not like to share Christmas with someone I'd never met, especially where there would only be 3 people.", "YTA. And that word doesn't mean what you think it means.", "YTa, you have some weird possession issues.  Also, you need to learn what gaslighting is, because this aint it.  Are you really 26?  This posts sounds like it was written by an 18 year old.", "YTA. He\u2019s trying to be kind to his friend. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t compromise - why not spend the first part of the day together and then have the guy over for dinner? Or have him in the morning for brunch and then you can spend the rest of the day alone.", "YTA. Talk about an extreme reaction and an unwillingness to have a conversation like an adult. \n\nSkipping over your inaccurate use of gaslighting, this was an opportunity to create some new traditions with your boyfriend and get to know someone who is important to him. \n\nYou\u2019re right that you don\u2019t have to feel guilty or care about Nico. But, you don\u2019t get to fight what that says about you as a person (spoiler alert: it doesn\u2019t say great things about you).", "You are not being gaslit\n\nBUT, I actually understand not wanting to spend Christmas with a complete stranger. Think about it like this though, a mild inconvenience for you might make this guy\u2019s entire year brighter.\n\nNAH", "NAH", "YTA. It was gonna be nobody TA; but then you said you tried to put him in a catch 22 asking if you could invite someone and he didn\u2019t respond how you through he would and said he was gaslighting you. That is not gaslighting. Nor is saying you\u2019re overreacting when it\u2019s seems like you didn\u2019t even expressed to your boyfriend that you were looking to spending the holiday intimately alone with him.  In fact, from your post, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised is you gaslight you boyfriend.\n\nTo OP\u2019s boyfriend; your girl is giving major red flags. GET OUT NOW/RUN!", "YTA - time to learn about compromise.  If you want to have a just you and boyfriend morning then have friend come over for dinner and a movie.....   Or have friend come over for lunch and then you and boyfriend have a couples night at home, etc.....  \n\nTis the season and all the jazz.  You might end up enjoying the new friend.... and heck yeah, invite a few friends over and have a small party.", "YTA, but it's not because you are uncomfortable spending Christmas with a stranger. It's because you're accusing your boyfriend of gaslighting, which is a serious thing and definitely not what he is doing.\n\nWhat if you invited a few friends and had Friends Christmas celebration?", "YTA. Your BF is doing exactly what you should at Christmas and is being a good friend. I hope you're lucky enough to never feel alone at Christmas time, have a heart!!", "YTA for this situation he\u2019s trying to do a really nice thing for a friend \n\nAND YTA for using gaslighting wrong when he\u2019s not in fact gaslighting you.", "NTA I think you BF is being kinda weird, there are many redflags here [him gaslighting you, him having friends especially from the gym/rugby, and let's not forget that he mentioned his friend is from the lgbtq+ community] honestly I'm sure he is cheating. Go with you parents to send a message and let them both [cheaters] have a nice christmas together. I would absolutely suggest you to break up with him. NTA op", "Isn't a word that I throw around when someone makes me mad???? /s", "Agreed they could have Xmas eve and Xmas morning to celebrate just them two and still show good will to someone who needs compassion in the afternoon. She talking like this guys has sucked up her entire life", "You said exactly what I was thinking. Very well put. \n\nOP YTA and also so manipulative. Also you clearly have no idea what gaslighting actually is. Gaslighting is not present in this story what so ever. What is present is you being manipulative and using \"threats\" of bringing a friend (hoping you could catch him with a double standard and have a \"gotcha\" moment when you thought he'd say no), which didn't work out for you, so then you threaten to abandon him on Xmas when you don't get your way.  \n\nI do understand you wanted to spend Xmas with him and have it just be you and him. That part is perfectly fine. You are absolutely entitled to feel like that and just want it to be the two of you. The thing that makes you TA is the fact that instead of having an adult conversation where you either come to a compromise or set boundaries - you go to accusing him of gaslighting (which again he was definitely not) to try to make yourself a victim and also try to manipulate him. \n\nTry having an actual adult conversation where you tell him your feelings and you guys can talk it out instead of you acting immature.", "Lol this is so tiktok of her.", "and she used it TWICE hahahahahahaha  \n\n\nYTA OP, I can't understand why you would even ask.", "This was my thought exactly. No concept of gaslighting. Seems like you heard a new word and now just want to use it. I've been with someone who gaslights. This is NOT it. It seems more like you looking for an excuse not to have to admit that YTA because that's exactly what you're being.", "Thank you,I'm so over that term,hardly anyone gets it right!", "So close a friend he's never introduced him to her in 3 years.", "Right? She acts like she's the queen of christmas and has no concept of how to compromise.", "Yeah, but I've never seen it misused *this* badly before. Wow.", "Well said.  \n\nI wonder if it\u2019s possible to compromise if it\u2019s important for OP to spend alone time during the holiday with her SO?
