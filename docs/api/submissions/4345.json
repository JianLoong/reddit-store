Which is weird... \n\nI'm also not seeing how he was gaslighting you about you saying \"What if I wanted to bring a friend?\" If anything, it sounds to me like you were trying to trap him into saying you couldn't bring a friend but he could and then use it against him to prove a point.\n\nEither way, I hope you all settle this and I hope his friend and you guys have a Merry Christmas.

It's fine to want to have a specific kind of holiday. Everyone is allowed to have their own desires, but being an adult is about balancing personal wants against the bigger picture. And part of the bigger picture is helping your SO get closer to their wants. Instead of working with your partner to make both of your wants possible, you immediately told him that his plans have less value than yours. Why wouldn't it be possible to split the day? Even a short dinner would probably be enough to let your partner show his friend that he isn't alone. If this person is important to you then you have to learn to work with each other, not against each other. It should never be your plans vs my plans.", "YTA. You see him at home everyday. On the holiday, he wants to do a nice thing for someone. When you said, \"What if I want to invite a friend of mine?\" and he *very reasonably* said that would be fine, you... called it gaslighting?

I hope if you find your self alone for Christmas people are kinder to you", "YTA for throwing around the term gaslighting when he offered you a compromise. Christmas is about family, yes, but it\u2019s also about the spirit of the season and some people feel compelled to invite those who have no one. The holidays are hard when you\u2019re alone. Have some compassion\u2026it doesn\u2019t cost you anything.", "YTA for using the word \u201cgaslighting\u201d incorrectly (and just having a bad attitude). Either you don\u2019t know what it means, or you do know but use it anyway because you think it makes your boyfriend look bad. It\u2019s not a term you throw around every time he disagrees with you.

I know it pops up a lot on Reddit, but this isn't gaslighting.", "YTA.", "YTA because you have seen how effective that term is is no reason to invoke it just because.

Do you understand what the term gaslighting even means, because I don't think you do? If anything, from what you told us he had to say during the conflict vs what you had to say, the only icky and manipulative thing I saw came from you threatening to go toyour familys to \"give them privacy.\" I would get over yourself and spend one Christmas of many being kind to others, and be thankful you have a partner who desires to do so.", "Idk...I definitely wouldn't be okay spending Christmas Day with some rando at my house...but I'm an AH without a bleeding heart so I don't know what that says about you.\n\nI guess YTA but I'd respond the same way, and head on over to my parents house instead.", "I don't get how he is gaslighting you? Also if I knew a friend of my husband's was alone for Christmas, I would definitely invite him/her over. I see no harm in it", "YTA. Gaslighting does not mean whatever you are trying to make it mean. To want to spend Christmas with just the two of you is fine, but you\u2019re a real piece of work on the rest of it. Just go visit your family if that\u2019s what you want.", "If my boyfriend did this, I would be greatly touched by his consideration and selflessness.  What a catch.  Instant turn on.  He's far more empathetic and compassionate than you, and he's probably wasting these great characteristics on someone who takes it for granted.  You're a grinch AND a scrooge.

That said, it does seem like a bit of an over reaction. \n\nI highly doubt that your boyfriend is suggesting Nico spend the whole entire day with you . Plan for him to come over in the afternoon/evening and you and your bf can still spend some quality time together in the morning.

You just seem to like using the new cool word of the day.\n\nHere's the meaning of being gas lit. Learn it and stop using it.\n\n\"Gaslighting is a colloquialism, loosely defined as manipulating someone so as to make them question their own reality. The term derives from the title of a British theatre play Gas Light (1938) by Patrick Hamilton though the term did not gain popular currency in English until the mid-2010s. The term may also be used to describe a person as a \"gaslighter\" who presents a false narrative to another group or person, thereby leading them to doubt their perceptions and become misled, disoriented or distressed. Often this is for the gaslighter's own benefit. Normally vague, this dynamic is possible only when the audience is vulnerable, such as in unequal power relationships, or fearful of the losses associated with challenging the false narrative.\n\nWhile I appreciate no wanting to host for the Holidays, your BF is asking for this one favour. Just do it or be an ah and leave him and his friend alone to celebrate. Either way, you are an AH  for not knowing the proper meaning of gas lighting and using it twice to vilify your BF because you can't have your own way.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA if only for the fact that if either of you is gaslighting it'd be you, not him.
