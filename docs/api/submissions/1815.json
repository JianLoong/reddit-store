So we are both at home but I was talking to the installation guy and didn't see her go into the kitchen. A few min later I smell food. I honestly thought maybe the installation guy brought a lunch or the neighbors were cooking  outside. \nBut no. Nina was reheating leftovers from last night! The same food that possibly caused her flatuence. Once I realized I said, \"what happened to you not eating spices?!\" She said, \"oh...yeah. forgot about that\" while chewing a piece of well seasoned tofu. \n\nSo, I'm declaring myself not the AH. I'm not even mad about this or mad at her, but I can't take responsibility for her choices. When she is serious about this we can talk about actual solutions.  Thanks to those who left reasonable comments. \n\n\nMy spouse, \"Nina\",  (we are both female) has had gastro issues for years. Until now it seemed she'd rather suffer through it than actively take steps to correct it. I've given her suggestions, sent health-related info, and made multiple doc appts. She's canceled all of them for one reason or another, except for one where she was going to get a colonoscopy. But the procedure didn't happen because the morning of, the doc called in sick and Nina did not want to use the backup doc that was scheduled. She never rescheduled. \n\nSo the issues continue. Not daily, but often. Stomach aches after eating, bloating, gassiness, constipation...you name it. To the point where she sleeps on the couch sometimes because the gassiness at night is horrid and wakes me up at night. \n\nLast night the same thing happened and this morning she said she thinks she needs to do an elimination diet to figure out what the issue is. She suspects it's either garlic, onion, or some other aromatic or spice. Great. This has been suggested before but she loves food and seasonings so she hasn't stuck to it (I should mention I am a trained chef, but it's no longer my career). I agree and then she says, \"We need to change how we eat.\" I told her I'm not going stop eating garlic because she has stomach problems. \n\nShe immediately got upset and said I wasn't being supportive. Because I do most of the cooking, she thinks I need to prepare food according to what she's eliminating. She said, \"So you're just not going to cook for me anymore?\" I said I'm still going to cook but I want to eat what I want to eat and I don't want to prepare bland food. I think she needs to take the initiative and meal prep food according to her needs and leave my cooking out of it. I would help her. But I'm still going to cook food with whatever ingredients I want. She will have to have to choose not to eat it. She thinks this is messed up because she loves my cooking and will have a hard time saying no. AITA for not accommodating her dietary needs?\n\nIn case it matters, Nina works fulltime (90% remote) and is the sole breadwinner for now and I am a fulltime student (remote).

And the answer that seems most obvious to me is resentment - resentment that she didn't take your advice and accept your prior efforts. And if that's the case, it is a whole other set of relationship issues.\n\nBut no, you shouldn't have to cook without garlic indefinitely.", "NTA.   \n\n\nHer lack of willpower isn't your problem.

There's no reason why you have to go on her diet at this point.", "NTA\n\nAs someone with \u2018Gastro Issues\u2019 (Dx: Crohn\u2019s), I notice she hasn\u2019t even made an effort to see what her issue is. No GI appointments, she didn\u2019t follow up with the colonoscopy. She\u2019s attempting process of elimination which is a common thing to do with gastrointestinal problems. Expecting you to accommodate her when she doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong with her doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I did process of elimination (and trial and error) with foods and didn\u2019t expect my family to accommodate me.  This is something I deal with and I need to be the one to figure out what I can and cannot tolerate. Working full time does limit you, but when one has special requests, especially for something concerning diet, one needs to accommodate themselves. To expect your family to change the way they eat for you is wrong. \n\nShe also really needs to see a doctor because elimination diet does take a bit of time\u2026", "NTA. You've offered to meal prep meals she can have while eating as you like. That's fair. She should really go see a doctor though. An elimination diet is effective, but it would be a good idea to also see someone who can at least help guide her to a diagnosis.", "NTA\n\nA lot of commenter seem to miss the actual issue. Let's take all the extra info out and break it down to what OP is actually asking:\n\nPartner: I want to try an elimination diet\n\nOP: Okay\n\nPartner: You have to do it with me\n\nOP: I don't want to change my diet\n\nPartner: You're an unsupportive asshole\n\nOP: Reddit, am I an asshole?", "So if it turns out that she does have an issue with garlic or onion or whatever, will you just never cook for her again? Refusing to uphold your end of your household arrangement?", "NTA. I read your comments to for more clarity. \n\nYou are willing to help her cook food for her elimination diet. To expect you to also do it to, when you have no need is ridiculous. I say that mainly based on the fact she hasn't even attempted to get a professional medical opinion. Especially when this is infringing on her daily life. \n\nShe can try this, but she should really seek medical help. And not expect you to not cook what you like because she may be \"tempted\". Cooking her elimination meals for her is supportive.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll do it she finally goes and sees a doctor and follows up on the colonoscopy.\n\nOne of the most basic things someone in a relationship owes there partner is a good faith effort to take care of themself. You girlfriend is neglecting her own medical care. If she wants you to care for her by helping with the elimination diet she needs to also take steps to rule out any more serious medical possibilities.", "INFO: if your wife took all the reasonable steps (which I agree are reasonable) to see doctors, get a diagnosis, etc. and found that she had to avoid certain foods/diets permanently, would you support her in that? And by support I do mean \"cook entire meals that fit her dietary requirements so you can enjoy those meals together.\"\n\nI ask b/c I can see the point you're making, re: her willpower argument, and how you can't realistically avoid food you enjoy forever just to save her from temptation. I do agree. (Autonomous adults with dietary restrictions and/or disordered eating must, indeed, learn basic willpower to function in normal/food-eating society, which generally doesn't cater to you.) However... every healthy partnership I know where one partner has severe dietary restrictions, the non-restrictive partner DOES learn to cook/enjoy their partner's new diet, and they do do a lot of it together. Not 100%, but a lot. For example, I know couples where one has to be vegan for medical reasons and yes: the non-vegan partner learned to cook exciting vegan recipes and eat them with their partner. Not always, but, yes, most of the time, because it doesn't make sense to make two completely separate meals for every meal (whether prepared by one person or two). I know many couples where one has to be gluten free, and I've watched the non-gluten free partner cook (also pro trained! stayed with such a couple recently)--there are workarounds that make sense in meal prep, and it's not making the other partner cook their own separate meal!\n\nSo are you willing to compromise AT ALL on mutual meals, should your wife get a formal diagnosis? Effects my vote, personally. If you love and are married to a person with severe medical/dietary restrictions, something has got to give and, yes, sometimes (or often) you should be making/consuming meals you both can eat imo. And she must also learn to resist temptation when you cook meals that she can't eat b/c you shouldn't be permanently deprived. Both are true, imo. But... she needs to go to the doctor first.", "YTA You have an agreement, she works and you take care of the household. It's not that hard to find recipes etc that don't include foods like garlic.\n\nI mean, what if she was super allergic to something?

That's kind of messed up.\n\nIf my g/f was allergic to something, or got a really upset stomach when I cooked something, you know what I would do? Not cook it... I will survive..

Although I get the feeling you would be a lot more willing to cut out garlic, etc, if your spouse had not been actively avoiding taking responsibility for her health issues, you should not be forced to adopt her diet restrictions. She needs to step up and start holding herself accountable for her own health.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re sacrificing much to stand with your spouse as she figures out what\u2019s wrong.

If cooking is your responsibility then it is pretty harsh. Likewise it's unreasonable to impact your lifestyle", "NTA. \n\nWhile taking the initiative to finally do an elimination diet good, she should still see the doctor as it might not be something she's eating that is causing the issues. \n\nIt isn't fair that you have to stop eating things due to her health issues. Can you compromise and make a simplified dish for her and a normal dish for herself for supper?", "YTA. Supportive partners want their spouse to feel better and be healthy - I don\u2019t think that refusing to feed the person who financially supports you is a good look on anyone.", "NTA", "NTA. she hasn\u2019t made ANY effort to handle her gastric issues. no appointments, not even following up on the appointments you helped her schedule. now she takes a stab in the dark at what might be wrong and you\u2019re expected to change your lifestyle to encourage her? probably a pretty dramatic change too to be eliminating spices entirely? if this was suggested by a doctor or a nutritionist or anyone with authority, you\u2019d be TA for not supporting her. but this is just something she\u2019s landed on seemingly randomly! while I agree with what others are saying, you want to support your spouse and this is what she\u2019s asking for support in, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly good for her to have you supporting her in AVOIDING dr\u2019s advice and trying to figure it out on her own", "ESH she needs to go get an allergy panel done. One simple blood test informed me I am gluten intolerant.  Cut out wheat barely and rye and BAM I feel amazing and don\u2019t have the bubble guts constantly anymore. \n\nBut you\u2019re seriously not willing to even prepare the elimination diet meals for her? You\u2019re a trained chef, my boyfriend went to culinary school and he cooks 90% of our meals because we both prefer his cooking (aside from select dishes I make). Have some compassion and be glad she is finally trying to address the issue rather than ignore it.", "NAH but this is obviously important to her, so it's worth working out a compromise.   \nConsider how long she will remain on the elimination diet for while it's happening, and whether it's feasible to keep some ingredients separate during cooking so you can both have your dietary preferences satisfied.   \n\n\nIf she only needs to do this for a couple of weeks to identify the problem food, it'll make things a lot easier.", "Nta. I (UK) have allergies/intolerances, and I had to push for tests. I'm allergic to meat, one group of fungi and I know blackcurrant from experience.  Also intolerance to lactose (breathing issues) and gluten (IBS sufferer). Your spouse has taken zero interest in her health until now. But I would say you'll cook 'her' diet...under guidance from a dr/nutritionist...that way you'll find out for sure what her triggers are (because tbh, that's a fekkin nightmare to navigate) and THEN you can say you'll cook 2 versions of one meal. If she tells you that you can't cook certain foods beyond medical diagnosis,  then call her bluff...she's not died from anaphylaxis this far after all.", "She\u2019s probably looking into the fodmap diet. There are supplements that you can get that help break down fodmaps. Look up Fodzyme. If these work for her, you wouldn\u2019t have to eliminate things like garlic and onion.

You have already tried to help her enough.", "Nta, you offered to make the food for her, why shouldn't you eat what you like?", "Light YTA. You cook, apparently that's a task that falls on your shoulders and you're fine with it. She has gastro problems and is finally doing something about it and... you can't give up garlic and onion for a week? It feels like you're making her pay for not doing what you wanted her to do so now you won't do what she wants to do. It's childish and most importantly useless unless you want that kind of passive aggressive communication to become the norm between the 2 of you. I will say she's not exactly innocent in this but people are weird with regards to doctors and diseases so if you care for her, just try to be her safe space, remove some ingredients, see if it helps and if she sticks to it.

That way you can finally get some answers!", "YTA. Do you even care about this person? Why would you not be supportive? You can season your food and make a version for her that is not seasoned. I do not understand why you would act so selfishly.", "YTA. So I have a ton of GI issues (hospitalized for some of them). Care is difficult for these issues. The first step is always the elimination diet, so why are you not supportive of this? Do you think sending her to the doctor will result in a magic pill or test to cure her? Trust me, that's NOT how it works. GI issues are one of the most difficult to get good healthcare for so I understand her reticence to follow up with GI care. Women are particularly dismissed for seeking this care, so there is a lot of frustration with GI doctors. At least that has been my 1st hand experience.", "ESH.   \n\n\nShe sucks for not taking care of things properly with a doctor and for just saying we're changing our diet.   \n\n\nYou suck for not being more accomodating and your attitude towards her on that.   \n\n\nYou should be working together to figure out meals you can both eat or that can be altered so both can eat. It is NOT that difficult.   \n\n\nI love to cook. My mother can't have onions, peppers, garlic.

This isn't a long term thing. If you can't pull off this small level of temporary compromise then you are probably not the best partner", "YTA - your attitude makes no sense and is self-defeating to boot.  For one, there are dozens of spices and herbs, and eliminating one of your favorites doesn't prevent you from finding alternatives that would keep your food flavorful.  For another, it's not like you are unaffected by her gas.  For a third, cooking food sounds like one of your major contributions to the household - feeding her is a major part of your responsibilities.  You don't get to just shuttle that aside, regardless of how inconvenient her diet ends up being.  \n\n\nAt worst, you just end up having your preferred spices as garnishes, right?  If she refused to not use a garnish, then \\*that\\* would be on her.", "YTA. You've been trying to get her to focus on her health, and now that she is, you stop supporting her.   \n\n\nThe garlic isn't forever, maybe.

But you don\u2019t want to give up your diet. You don\u2019t even have to do it completely, just with meals you share with her.\n\nCome to a compromise. Start her off. Do it for a week or two with her so she can get used to it, and then slowly add it back into your food.

It shows very little interest or follow though.\n\nHowever, it sounds like cooking falls under your contribution to the house. If accommodating her dietary restrictions became a genuine solution to her pain and issues, it\u2019s reasonable to have you adjust your household meals.\n\nBut it\u2019s silly for her to expect you to cook to cure her without her making any other efforts.\n\nEdit: clarity", "YTA. She works full time and brings in the money. I understand that her not wanting to deal with her issues in the past.
