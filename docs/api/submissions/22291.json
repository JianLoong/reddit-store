Is her aggression recent spurned on by something or has it always been there?", "ESH. she had no right to blame you for gaining weight, but you definitely didnt need to go off making her insecurities just that much worse.", "It\u2019s not ok for you to yell at your girlfriend, and it\u2019s not ok for her to blame you for her weight gain. \n\nYou need to control the words that come out of your mouth, and she needs to control the food that goes into hers. \n\nESH.", "ESH. Holy mother\u2026.you both suck. You for how you handled this, putting down your SO\u2026yelling\u2026yuck. She sucks for not taking responsibility for herself. Quite honestly unless you both learn how to communicate like adults, your relationship probably has run it\u2019s course.", "ESH. She knows she\u2019s fat of her own accord and you bottle it up until you explode. All her great qualities are being overshadowed by her self loathing. You can\u2019t make her lose weight. Only she can. So you either both agree to not discuss it anymore period, or you separate.", "NTA for rejecting her assessment of blame and lack of accountability. \n\nYTA for your commentary - it was needlessly inflammatory and hurtful. You could have told her to grow up without using words or phrases like, \u201cenormous belly,\u201d or \u201cgigantic ass.\u201d To an outsider, it doesn\u2019t seem like you admire her for all of the wonderful qualities you claim to recognize in her.\n\nShe is coming to you from a place of insecurity. While it is wrong for her to blame you, it seems like her comments are more of a cry for help than anything. You could be more supportive by helping her find different methods of achieving the healthier lifestyle she desires. Instead, you only encourage her to feed into her insecurities.", "YTA. I was going to say E S H because she absolutely shouldn't blame you and I do think her behaviour is unacceptable. But this crossed the line for me:\n\n'I told her that the double chin she whines about, is her fault. I told her that her enormous belly is the fault of her and her pigging out'\n\nHoly shit. What a way to speak to someone you're supposed to care about.", "YTA. Come the hell on son, seriously? Like you actually went through every point she's sensitive about one after the other because she was being a brat and that annoyed you. What did you gain by \"winning\" that argument? You've pissed her off, you've shown her that you also notice and think about where she's insecure, and that you'll throw that back at her if you think it'll hurt her as a topper to an argument. I would normally vote this E S H because she was not in the right at all and her behaviour is downright immature and shows that she doesn't take responsibility for herself. You however went above and beyond with nowhere near enough justification.", "ESH - her weight is between her and her doctor and you have nothing to do with it unless you\u2019re feeding her. \n\nDepending on how long this has been going on, she may have other issues - medications, hormones, mental health can all lead to weight gain and should be evaluated by a professional. \n\nHowever, the last half of your post makes me wonder if you even like your girlfriend. Stop insulting her and encourage her to get help, see a doctor or a councilor.", "YTA for your comments. \n\nNTA for your reasoning.", "NTA for her situation but YTA for your flying off the handle.\n\nFor her, step one of getting healthy is for her to take responsibilty of herself. Unless you held her down and forced cookies down her gullet, you are not the cause of her obesity.  She is deflecting her poor choices on you to avoid being accountable.\n\nHowever.... you were a prick when you went over your laundry list of her physical faults. You need to ask yourself, \"if she never changes- doesn't get bigger but also doesn't get smaller-, would you stay or go\"? IF stay, then shut up and try to be a little more practical and encouraging. If no, end the relationship now.", "Both the AH", "Not even remotely.. fuck that unaccountability bullshit.. How is it remotely your fault? So you spoon feed her Oreos and ice cream 3 times a day? \ud83d\ude44", "Your gf seems more abusive than \u201cwonderful, warm, loving.\u201d Just saying.", "NTA - you were simply going to her what she goes to you.  It is her fault.  Unless you are shoving food down her throat", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s an adult who can make her own decisions, why would you be responsible for that? In regards to her weight, if she\u2019s serious about her health she should seek professional advice and not count on you to\u2026 monitor what she eats? It sounds more like she\u2019s upset about her weight gain and is just taking it out on you. You should let her know you shouldn\u2019t be responsible and she needs to go to a professional. I feel like you could\u2019ve been less hurtful with what you said but I can see why you felt frustrated. I can\u2019t understand people who blame others for things that are in their own control. Also, she said you were too riled up to reason with but she should calm down and make a plan for herself.", "NTA, you deserve better than that narcissist\nAll the people calling you ah because you snapped after all that abuse are delusional", "NTA!  No one gets to constantly blame another person for their poor choices.", "NTA\n\nYou were harsh and kind of an AH too, but that happens when you get treated unfairly like this for a long period of time. So I'll give nta instead of e s h.", "NTA - this might be an unpopular opinion but I\u2019m willing to die on this hill. \n\nYOUR HEALTH IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!\n\nHer blaming you for her food choices and refusing to take responsibility is literally manipulation. It\u2019s the same as people asking questions they don\u2019t want the answer to. I had a girlfriend like this, who constantly said it was her husbands fault she was fat. She\u2019d say it in front of people and we could see how it would break his heart that she\u2019d use her own insecurities to break him down like that. It wears on a partner to be held responsible for something they can\u2019t control. It gets old. \n\nI think you gave her a healthy dose of reality. She needed to hear what she didn\u2019t want to tell herself. Could you have been nicer? Sure, but if she wants you to care about her feelings she should care about yours. Something tells me you\u2019ve been walking on eggshells for a while. I think you\u2019re allowed this one slip up.", "Break up with her dude, got find someone that likes jogging and you'll be insanely happier", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
