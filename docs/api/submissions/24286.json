I am the assistant manager and answer to the store manager. We have a couple new shift managers who have recently completed management training. Our newest shift manager, Megan (19F), has been doing really well except for one misstep that keeps happening.\n\nUntil we undergo a remodel (which can't come soon enough), our safe where we keep the cash registers and our deposits throughout the day is located behind the front counter where customers order and pick up. It's behind a swinging door and two cabinet doors that cannot be locked. Megan has a habit of leaving the safe door open while she's swapping cash drawers, etc. She will sometimes be away from it for up to a minute at a time. I've patiently told her why that's not okay and have even given her written warnings (which our store manager eventually sees), but it continues to happen. Not every shift but enough for it to be concerning.\n\nEarlier this week it happened again. I found the safe wide open. While Megan was out of eyesight, I took our deposit bag and locked it in my locker. I was able to do this before she even came back to the safe. She went about her business and led a good shift. But when it was time for the shift change, she noticed it was gone.\n\nAfter looking for it, Megan was about to call the store manager and the police, per protocol for security issues. I stopped her as she was dialing the phone and told her I had the bag, then took her to my locker to retrieve it. I told her to let this be a lesson because if I could take it without her noticing then anyone else could just as easily. She was visibly upset. I validated her feelings as best as I could but told her she would be feeling much worse if it had actually been stolen.\n\nMegan and a couple of coworkers who she is friends with are calling me an AH. I think this was an effective, albeit, blunt way to teach her to be more careful with the safe, but so far, according to the people who know it happened, I am in the minority with this opinion.", "created_utc": 1691611547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mpxmo/aita_for_teaching_a_coworker_a_lesson_by_tricking/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the money was stolen, its not like she would have had to repay it, and odds are, you and your Manager would look really bad having her still on staff, in a pre management position with written warnings on this very topic in her file.  Let me guess, whoever thinks otherwise has no skin in the game, won't have to be responsible to repay, and can't get fired.", "NTA\n\nIt's a lesson she needs to learn. \n\nI will point out that you call her Megan for the most part, however in the 2nd paragraph, line 3, word 18 you called her Bev. :)", "You're NTA. I'm not sure what more you can do here, though. You've said you've given her written warnings; going forward you'll either have to write her up or report her to management. Letting a safe sit open unattended has to be a fireable offense. That's just begging for trouble in the stupidest way possible.", "Did you really almost go to jail to teach a girl a lesson? Because if the deposit bag was found in your locker, I don't think anyone would believe you that you were not about to take off with it...", "Is what you did protocol however? Corporate systems don't like stuff like this. You created a financial risk yourself by locking it up in a less secured area. Obviously it made sense, but it could get you fired or reprimanded. I would escalate the issue next time to protect yourself. Take for example, security staff leaving premises to intervene in something, that may have even happened on premises; they are 99% of the time let go due to the liability of it. Not totally paralleled in the literal sense, but it's a case of doing something that fits within what you'd expect of the job, but it is prohibited.   \n\n\nCheck with your manager if you think it'll not get you fired.  \n\n\nNTA though to her, she needed it, but maybe a write up would make more sense.

Something like this has happened before at an old part-time I worked at except money was actually stolen and it was a whole issue.\n\nThat said, it's not really on you to jeopardise your career and you probably should've just kept writing her up. If money does get stolen then it's all on her. If your area manager doesn't act on it seriously and it disappears well there's a paper trail for negligence.\n\nIf she gets fired over it it's her own fault.", "NTA.  She doesn't care because it's not her money and because she's not old enough to know better.  If the nice warnings don't work you have to step it up, and this was better than firing her.", "Why hasn't she been fired for not following policy and for insubordination? - NTA", "NTA \ud83d\udc4d\n\nthat was really little far but still good", "NTA - management has it's privileges.", "NTA you have given her a lot of warnings already. An embarrassing lesson is better than being let go over it.", "NTA, this is gross negligence. In man professions a mistake this fundamental and mission critical could result in injury or death.", "NTA you have warned her enough times that she deserves to feel the stress. Have you talked to the manager about it other than the written warnings?", "NTA. There's a name for this type of lesson: \"stinging,\" and it's harsh but effective.

Ask Megan and her friends if they would prefer it if she was fired for cause.", "YTA. Good job almost getting yourself arrested, OP. If you hadn't intercepted before someone called the cops you'd be left literally holding the bag. With that smoking gun of the crime wholly within your possession, you would lose your job and have to plead guilty to stealing from your employer. That would come up in background checks for the rest of your life, making you virtually unemployable.\n\nAside from the massive self-inflicted damage you avoided by sheer luck, Megan isn't your child. It is super inappropriate to \"punish\" her that way. Just continue writing her up. That's your job. That way, if the money does go missing, everyone will point the finger at Megan.\n\nAnd what do you care if the money takes off? It's not your business. You don't own it. You put your ass and your future on the line in a major way as an assistant manager at a restaurant. You're not loss detection or a security guard or CEO.

You just taught her a lesson the only way you could get it to sink in.", "Maybe it's just my company but I think all ff restaurants prohibit in store recording. We still do it for security reasons like this (investigating theft) but from what I understand it is a catch 22 because you cant both claim \"no store recording per company policy\"but then be like \"OhOh the tapes just show her being dumb. Money here. All good.\"\n\nNTA that kind of negligence is just so annoying. Just hope she actually learns from it and doesnt hold a gudge instead (especially since her friends /coworkers are on her side", "YTA that was an incredible unprofessional way to teach someone a lesson.

I\u2019m shocked the deposit didn\u2019t come up short that very night. Try explaining you were just teaching a lesson then.", "This. Taking the money was risky, OP. Management could decide you're creating a hostile work environment or something. And once the safe was locked back up again, your locker was a significantly less safe spot for the money. Bad move. Plus someone in upper management might be sleeping with her (or want to) or has another connection you don't know about.\n\nDo not write down anywhere what you have done or tell anyone about it in case it can be used against you. (There's probably already video footage on top of her verbal account, but you don't want to add to the evidence trail any more or draw any focus to what you did. Never bring it up. Never reference it. It didn't happen.) Just focus on writing her up. Hopefully experiencing the terror of thinking the money was stolen will straighten her out. Either way, you're already leaving a paper trail of your concerns.", "He's not \"personally invested.\" She's an assistant manager.

I don't care how many downvotes I get for it, but OP: do not hide company assets that should be in a safe in your locker as prank. The only proof it was a prank if a cop busts open that locker is your word. And welcome to the real world! Nobody will believe you.", "Yeah, no.  Not even a little bit.", "How so? No harm no foul lol. All the money would\u2019ve been in the box while the interaction would most likely be caught on camera as well. If anything the oblivious employee would be fired for negligence.", ">But when it was time for the shift change, she noticed it was gone\n\nShift change means everything gets rebalanced and checked so the (current) shift money *was* short which led to figuring out why which led to her realizing that bag was missing from safe.", "Sadly, that doesn't invalidate what u/beanfiddler was saying. Clearly an unpopular opinion considering the downvotes, but they're actually right: OP has no way to definitively prove they hid the money in their own locker to teach Megan a lesson. If they had been caught, it would be very easy to say that they had decided to take advantage of her negligence to steal the money. All of this could have backfired on OP in a major way, making them an AH to themselves. \n\nLeaving it alone beyond writing her up? Well, pretty sure it would be illegal to make OP pay back the money if it was stolen so it really is not their problem as long as they kept writing her up. If the employer was so worried about the loss of the money, they would fire her themselves. If the employer decided to blame OP for not \"fixing the problem\" despite all the write-ups, they are an awful employer and OP's problem is finding a different job, not Megan's stupidity. Focus on being stoic about this, OP. You can't change Megan or your employer's attitude, but you can care less about the things you can't control.", "If his supervisor expects him to make himself vulnerable to an arrest and felony charge as a \"trick\" to deter the recklessness of another employee that *might* result in theft, then his employer is unreasonable and he needs to find a new job.\n\nLuckily for OP, it seems he came up with this scheme all by himself rather than being asked to do so by his employer, making him, indeed, the asshole.", "Stealing is a felony. If they recover all the money that means his employer can't sue him but the prosecutors can definitely still decide to press charges if they want. And good luck convincing a cop that you just wanted to teach Megan a lesson and that is why you were caught red-handed with a bag of money, you were not actually doing the incredibly obvious thing and taking advantage of her known negligence to steal money. There's literally no proof that he intended this as a prank if someone opened that locker and found the cash inside. He would be royally fucked.", "I'm, sadly, not even surprised a little bit. I did enough work in criminal defense to know that people will confess to doing incredibly stupid things and then just expect the police to take their word for it that there's an innocent explanation for why they were caught red-handed with evidence of a felony. Cops might be thick, but the criminals they catch are even worse. Making everyone in this post a really easy mark for catching a felony and ruining their life. Over what, a job that pays like $25 an hour, tops?", "NTA\nIf someone did that to me I\u2019d be so furious.

You have now given her a practical lesson that hopefully does penetrate her brain. (Although her being so generally careless with $$ leaves me with scant hope).\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019d say NTA but op, you are playing with fire. She can very easily claim you were trying to steal. And noticing how she is younger than you, she didn\u2019t happen to get this job from sheer work alone. I\u2019m not trying to say she will, but given what has transpired and the evidence provided, it could very well escalate if she wanted it too.", "Or fire them if they're too clueless or stubborn to learn a simple rule. I think OP was trying one last time to get the message through. And showed more patience than many workplaces would.", "I can believe it. When I was younger, I would have done something like this too. I just hope OP and others read this and learn. At least your original comment is no longer in the negative..."]}
