I am the assistant manager and answer to the store manager. We have a couple new shift managers who have recently completed management training. Our newest shift manager, Megan (19F), has been doing really well except for one misstep that keeps happening.\n\nUntil we undergo a remodel (which can't come soon enough), our safe where we keep the cash registers and our deposits throughout the day is located behind the front counter where customers order and pick up. It's behind a swinging door and two cabinet doors that cannot be locked. Megan has a habit of leaving the safe door open while she's swapping cash drawers, etc. She will sometimes be away from it for up to a minute at a time. I've patiently told her why that's not okay and have even given her written warnings (which our store manager eventually sees), but it continues to happen. Not every shift but enough for it to be concerning.\n\nEarlier this week it happened again. I found the safe wide open. While Megan was out of eyesight, I took our deposit bag and locked it in my locker. I was able to do this before she even came back to the safe. She went about her business and led a good shift. But when it was time for the shift change, she noticed it was gone.\n\nAfter looking for it, Megan was about to call the store manager and the police, per protocol for security issues. I stopped her as she was dialing the phone and told her I had the bag, then took her to my locker to retrieve it. I told her to let this be a lesson because if I could take it without her noticing then anyone else could just as easily. She was visibly upset. I validated her feelings as best as I could but told her she would be feeling much worse if it had actually been stolen.\n\nMegan and a couple of coworkers who she is friends with are calling me an AH. I think this was an effective, albeit, blunt way to teach her to be more careful with the safe, but so far, according to the people who know it happened, I am in the minority with this opinion.", "created_utc": 1691611547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mpxmo/aita_for_teaching_a_coworker_a_lesson_by_tricking/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure what more you can do here, though. You've said you've given her written warnings; going forward you'll either have to write her up or report her to management.

Because if the deposit bag was found in your locker, I don't think anyone would believe you that you were not about to take off with it...", "Is what you did protocol however? Corporate systems don't like stuff like this. You created a financial risk yourself by locking it up in a less secured area. Obviously it made sense, but it could get you fired or reprimanded. I would escalate the issue next time to protect yourself. Take for example, security staff leaving premises to intervene in something, that may have even happened on premises; they are 99% of the time let go due to the liability of it. Not totally paralleled in the literal sense, but it's a case of doing something that fits within what you'd expect of the job, but it is prohibited.   \n\n\nCheck with your manager if you think it'll not get you fired.  \n\n\nNTA though to her, she needed it, but maybe a write up would make more sense.

That would come up in background checks for the rest of your life, making you virtually unemployable.\n\nAside from the massive self-inflicted damage you avoided by sheer luck, Megan isn't your child. It is super inappropriate to \"punish\" her that way. Just continue writing her up. That's your job. That way, if the money does go missing, everyone will point the finger at Megan.\n\nAnd what do you care if the money takes off? It's not your business. You don't own it.

Management could decide you're creating a hostile work environment or something. And once the safe was locked back up again, your locker was a significantly less safe spot for the money. Bad move. Plus someone in upper management might be sleeping with her (or want to) or has another connection you don't know about.\n\nDo not write down anywhere what you have done or tell anyone about it in case it can be used against you. (There's probably already video footage on top of her verbal account, but you don't want to add to the evidence trail any more or draw any focus to what you did. Never bring it up. Never reference it. It didn't happen.) Just focus on writing her up. Hopefully experiencing the terror of thinking the money was stolen will straighten her out.

No harm no foul lol. All the money would\u2019ve been in the box while the interaction would most likely be caught on camera as well. If anything the oblivious employee would be fired for negligence.", ">But when it was time for the shift change, she noticed it was gone\n\nShift change means everything gets rebalanced and checked so the (current) shift money *was* short which led to figuring out why which led to her realizing that bag was missing from safe.", "Sadly, that doesn't invalidate what u/beanfiddler was saying. Clearly an unpopular opinion considering the downvotes, but they're actually right: OP has no way to definitively prove they hid the money in their own locker to teach Megan a lesson. If they had been caught, it would be very easy to say that they had decided to take advantage of her negligence to steal the money. All of this could have backfired on OP in a major way, making them an AH to themselves. \n\nLeaving it alone beyond writing her up? Well, pretty sure it would be illegal to make OP pay back the money if it was stolen so it really is not their problem as long as they kept writing her up. If the employer was so worried about the loss of the money, they would fire her themselves. If the employer decided to blame OP for not \"fixing the problem\" despite all the write-ups, they are an awful employer and OP's problem is finding a different job, not Megan's stupidity.

If they recover all the money that means his employer can't sue him but the prosecutors can definitely still decide to press charges if they want. And good luck convincing a cop that you just wanted to teach Megan a lesson and that is why you were caught red-handed with a bag of money, you were not actually doing the incredibly obvious thing and taking advantage of her known negligence to steal money. There's literally no proof that he intended this as a prank if someone opened that locker and found the cash inside. He would be royally fucked.", "I'm, sadly, not even surprised a little bit. I did enough work in criminal defense to know that people will confess to doing incredibly stupid things and then just expect the police to take their word for it that there's an innocent explanation for why they were caught red-handed with evidence of a felony.

The OP could just tell the truth.\n\nWas it dangerous for OP to put the money in their locker? Sure. Does it mean the OP would automatically be fired and convicted if caught? Of course not.", "NTA\nYou showed your coworker what could happen if someone did rob the safe due to her actions.

So in that respect you were kind. Don\u2019t do it again though because this could have gone so badly wrong with someone firing you for theft.", "yeah the story is stupid. Can't believe the people are siding with op. Goes against manager to teach a petty lesson by creating way more risk than needed and absolutely not warn any one in the process ?
