It took some finessing on my part since he doesn't really use social media, so getting in contact with his friends was slightly more difficult than anticipated, but I made it happen. I planned an afternoon arcade trip, a family dinner at a restaurant he likes, then I rented an Airbnb for the night and promised my parents that my friends and I would play chaperone for the night and that they could turn in early. \n\nThe person I left off the guest list was my fianc\u00e9e.

What's going to happen down the road if you do actually get married and have family events?", "ESH. You can't just hide a whole party from your fiancee, she's going to feel pretty hurt about that obviously. As for her, she has beef with a teenager. What's the deal there?\n\nYou're getting married! You two need to talk about disagreements and conflicts, not go behind each other's backs and hope they don't notice.", "ESH. You lied to your girlfriend instead of behaving like an adult by having an adult conversation with her about the (legitimate) reasons why she wasn\u2019t invited.", "YTA, you shouldn't be marrying someone you are choosing to exclude from events. She's supposed to be your life partner and if you're already actively keeping things secret from her it's not going to work out.\n\nI agree that that it made your brothers party better by her not being there, but keeping it hidden was an AH thing to do.", "ESH\n\nYour fiance needs to stop with the spoiled child jokes, and you need to tell her to stop. Lying to her by omission about the party was not cool either. You two need to learn to communicate if you want a successfulmarriage. She also needs to get over it.

If your fianc\u00e9e is jealous to the point she's borderline bullying your kid brother, that's something that you should have put an end to. Is that the kind of behaviour you'll accept in a spouse towards your kid brother? What happens when she inevitably does the same thing to **your future children**?

Not a great way to start the rest of your life together if you can\u2019t even be honest. I suggest talking to her about how her comments need to stop as it is driving a wedge between her and the family.

If shit's that bad between them then fine don't invite her, it's his birthday after all and he should enjoy himself, but don't lie to her about it...\n\nShe might've been mad either way but it's at least kind understandable why you didn't invite her. Lying, not so much", "YTA. You hid everything from her then lied to her afterwards. That's totally inappropriate behaviour towards someone you are supposed to love. There would be no coming back from this one with me; trust is vital in a healthy relationship and you have just destroyed it.", "YTA Do you even see her as family? Is it how you'll behave every time, casting her aside? You'll put your brother first before her? You could've had an adult discussion with her about it.

Why would you invite anyone he wasn't close to/on good terms with?\nI assume your fiancee spends time with her family or friends alone on occasion right?\n\nThe only issue here is that you didn't tell her about it. You should be more forthcoming in the future if you want a successful life with her.", "YTA for hiding it from her. You may have had a good reason to not invite her, but you don't have a good reason for keeping the whole thing from her. Communication is important in any relationship, especially for a couple that plans to get married. I think you should have expressed to her that you're not keen on inviting her due to her past behaviour, and had a proper conversation about why she acts the way she does.

It was a party for a child and his friends not a family gathering, there was no need for her to be there.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NTA - your brother is uncomfortable with your fiancee, and it was his party. That and she has made it a point to make pointed comments at his expense (I will not call them \"jokes\" - jokes are when both sides are laughing), she had to expect at some time or another this was going to happen. That and, even if you were married, you are allowed to go to events as an individual. That said, it probably would have saved you some heartburn if you had told her about it beforehand. She might not have liked it, but if she is going to continue to bully your brother, this is bound to happen.", "YTA if you intend for this woman to be part of your family she should have been invited to the family dinner.

Honestly, I'd still think you were not the AH if you told her this directly in response to her fighting over it.\n\nWhat would she expect?  She clearly has a fair amount of resentment/jealousy/whatever towards your younger brother.  He picks up on it and doesn't want her around.  This is 100% her deal.\n\nIf anything, I think you should risk \"hurting her feelings\" and explain why she was not invited.   So maybe she has a chance to address it.  If she gets angry or defensive, that's 100% her deal.", "NTA. I think you also did the right thing trying to spare her feelings. But she probably knew she was excluded intentionally. You are engaged, why wouldn't she be invited to a family function? \n\nBut do you want to be with someone who makes it hard to be with family? I know we only see the little snippet of the whole relationship here, but you need to address this as a couple so that you don't have to always play referee in the future. When you are married, you'll have to be on each others' team.", "Yta because you\u2019re going to marry her and it sounds like she didn\u2019t even know about it. Not a great partnership.

Didn\u2019t even let her try to salvage a relationship with a future brother in law.", "Esh - you need to have a talk with your fiance about why she really wasn't invited. Is this going to happen at his graduation? At his wedding?", "YTA \n\nYou didn't HAVE TO invite her HOWEVER you should NOT have lied to her nor kept it a secret from her cause that's breaking her trust more than anything", "NTA  \nYou were going to piss her off either way. At least this way the argument was after the party and not before it.  \nAlthough her treatment of him does not bode well for your future, that was NOT your question lol  \nIf she thinks she should have been invited, she's either oblivious or malicious.
