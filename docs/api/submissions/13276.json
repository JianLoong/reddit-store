For me personally it took years to realize what I was up against.\n\nI understand it's frustrating to live with, having been on both ends.

You are in your rights to expect that he cleans them (and reimburses you if they are stained) or to pay for laundry service if he\u2019s too lazy to wash them.

Even with a mattress protector on (which ime usually aren\u2019t actually waterproof) the oils and dirt would\u2019ve likely seeped through into the mattress itself as well.", "If he had a mattress protector, mattress should be fine? Is it stained?", "Simply tell him to clean (or pay for you to clean) the items in question out of common courtesy.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of rent or rules you established before his arrival, but a simple \"as you found it\" expectation isn't unwarranted.   Let the bedding go.   It was your choice to offer it, and honestly he should have respected/maintained it, but it's a small matter.\n\nThe mattress however, if somehow marred, stained, etc., is a reasonable expectation for reimbursement if it's condition before said guest was new.  A mattress under regular use gets somewhat nasty- never mind use from an apparent slob.  Telling him to buy it from you is entirely reasonable.", "NTA OP.  Ok, I just went through something similar.  I let my bonus son and his two kids stay with me while he was waiting to move into his apartment (6 months).  Man, I don't know how to describe the extensive cleaning I had to do to get rid of the funk in my guest bedroom once I force them to move.  First of all, I had to remind a grown ass man (30+) to shower and had to make my bonus grandkids take a bath every other day.  He didn't like this so he and kids would stay out until he thought I was asleep.  When they finally moved out, the mattress pad was torn and the mattress had that deep funky smell and dirty.  I had to first dump a big box of baking soda on the mattress for 24 hours to absorb the odor.  Then I had to spot clean and spot rinse that mattress and let dry.   The sheets, blankets and comforter were nasty dirty, so much so that even when I washed them 3 times, they were dingy and I ended up throwing them out.  I had to take the curtains off of the rods and wash them too because of the scent embedded in them.  I had to wash all 4 walls, baseboards, ceiling fan blades and mop the floor with disinfectant solution .\n\nNow before anyone ask, no, I didn't check the guest bedroom because he kept door closed, there was no reason for me to go in the room and I was respecting his privacy.  I also didn't expect that I would have to tell a grown man to not only wash his and his kids bodies but to wash the bed linens.  So all this said is because I've notice people saying that OP should have had a conversation with her guest about washing the linen.  Who thinks about telling a grown ass MF to clean their body and bed linen?  They are supposed to know this!!!", "If he needs to furnish the place he is moving into, I think you should offer to sell him the bedroom setup. Mattress, sheets etc for a price lower than it would cost him to purchase new ($200-300). Hopefully he will be lazy and jump at the chance to take what he is already using. Bonus: you get a bit of compensation and don't have to deal with washing/burning/throwing away the items he has destroyed. Unfortunately,  I don't think asking him to pay to replace the items will work.  You deserve better treatment than you have gotten from this friend, but it is unrealistic to expect him to suddenly take accountability for his actions after the way he has behaved. It's not fair, I'm sorry.", "NTA for sure. Those sheets are done, you are supposed to switch out sheets to give them a break, not just to clean them. The elastic might be worn out, the fabric has been worn thin and might rip easy. Some of these redditors might have never seen end of life of a sheet set but yours is definitely there.\n\n\nIf they had been washed and he purchased his own set, or asked for a second set to switch with that would be different. He is a grown man and he sounds disgusting and like a child.

That\u2019s disgusting. Downvote me all you want.", "Right? And even if the sheets are ruined, OP had a mattress protector, he shouldn't have to replace everything, just the sheets.

He should have been washing his sheets, and you should have said something before now. \n\nYou have a mattress protector on the mattress - the sheets are gross and possibly a loss, but the mattress is fine. Throw the sheets and pillows out, get another cheap set, and never let this guy stay with you again. \n\nYWBTA", "ESH he\u2019s not clean and not a great guest but you should have spoken up.

And before I get asked I try to wash my sheets once a month.", "I don't know how old you are but you sound super childish. I also own my own house but it's up to you to set boundaries, as I have multiple sets of bedding for the double bed in my spare room that can also be changed. You haven't shared any communication to him with any other posters other than childishly stating redditors don't wash their bedding. When I'm certain we all do, you're deflecting the fact you didn't lay ground rules for the beginning. Also he may also be thinking you didn't have any spare covers or haven't offered any spare covers for the bed in your house. Again, communication. Stop being an unreasonable child because you don't agree with everyone's response.\n YTA.", "YTA, he should have washed them more but you should have communicated that when he moved in. You could have taken a $500 deposit for the items and then you could recover the money. At this point I\u2019d just take a loss on the sheets instead of starting a fight and losing a friend. He\u2019s already moving out so there\u2019s not really any point in resolving the issues now.\n\nIf they\u2019re whites then it\u2019s easier to deep clean with bleach.

If someone let's you stay at their house that long, you should be cleaning up after yourself. It's just good manners.", "NTA...I agree with you. He's a grown a$$ man. Adults shouldn't have to be told to wash the sheets. What's next??? Wipe your butt after defecating? Wash your hands? Shower routinely? How many people out there are not only disgusting, but obviously non-functional adults?", "NTA. He is an adult.
