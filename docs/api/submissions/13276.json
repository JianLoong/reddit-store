Unless you\u2019re leaving out some gory details, sleeping on 10 month unwashed sheets - while definitely suspect in terms of hygiene - doesn\u2019t permanently ruin them.", ">None of it was fancy stuff, all off Amazon and cost me like $500 total.\n\n????  I don\u2019t want to know what you consider fancy, OP.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t want your guest to use $500 bedding, *don\u2019t put $500 bedding on the guest bed!*\n\nESH", "NTA. I would give him the boot if I were you though", "NTA - But I don't think he owes $500. He should replace the sheets and pillowcases. Don't see how the bed is affected since there is a mattress protector on it.", "I'm leaning towards ESH. But I feel like there is some information missing here.\n\nLike for example, where the sheets visibly dirty? Forgive my ignorance but I dont understand why those sheets cant just be washed, despite not being washed in a while insted of replacing them.", "NTA grown people should know how to clean up after themselves", "ESH, you offered the room furnished and didn't state that he would be responsible to replace them if he neglected to keep a regular cleaning schedule. Now you know. \n\nWhat is the problem with the mattress though? It had a protector, can't you just replace that and get new sheets?", "NTA for being disappointed your property was not properly taken care of. Expecting him to pay for $500 worth of bedding though does make you a bit of an AH, especially if you willingly let him live in your house.\nYou need to have an honest conversation with him and work on some sort of compromise.", "NTA. That is just disgusting and indeed he should replace it.", "YTA\n\nMaybe you should have said something months ago instead of saying nothing and getting all pissed off about it.", "YTA for the mattress part.  unless it's damaged or stained at all? \n\nfor the other stuff, i'd say YTA too. it sounds like you offered up your own sheets with no strings. and that sounds like reasonable wear and tear over almost a year of use.", "YTA. You charge for actual damage, not just because he doesn't meet your standards of cleanliness. Make him launder the bedding when he leaves, *then* you can charge for replacement if it doesn't come out clean. (From my experience it probably won't, but you don't know for sure.)\n\nUnless he literally shat the bed the mattress probably doesn't need replacing.", "YTA. This conversation didn't happen before he moved in? Or the next month when he didn't clean them. Or the next? Can't put it on him now. Just know he is that friend and don't offer next time.", "This sounds like he might have something else going on. Like, your not entirely an asshole, but, you definitely approached it kinda like one. \n\nHindsight is 2020 but, when someone is showing obvious signs of mental illness, it's probably best to go with the, \"do you need some help?\" approach. Like, maybe they need to see a counselor or get some kind of diagnostic testing done.", "NTA..for expecting him to wash his sheets and pillowcases..etc...But even if he washed them regularly, he has lived there for an entire year, wouldn't you be replacing all the sheets and bedspreads anyway? Would you really keep the same sheets a man has used all year, even IF he washed them on a regular basis?\n\nOf course hindsight is a wonderful thing, as you should have told him before he moved in to buy his own sheets and that, but yeah it really doesn't matter because you should be replacing them anyway!", "I'm pretty grossed out by the number of people who seem to think that if you don't tell a grown man to clean their bedding it's your responsibility if they don't. After 10 months of never washing the bedding everything would have soaked through the mattress protector into the mattress unless it's a $150+ waterproof one like i own (i spilled an entire cup of coffee on my bed and it didn't seep through). People SWEAT in their sleep.  A LOT. Sheets can't just endlessly absorb sweat and oils and dirt over 10 months and be ok. The mattress is very likely permanently stained and stinky. Not to mention if he's that gross,  who knows what kind of fungus he might have or mold that might have grown from never cleaning. I've seen boys live like pigs and what can happen to sheets that aren't cleaned, it's foul. Why isn't anyone expected to have common sense here? You shouldn't have had to say \"if you rarely wash any linens the entire time you're here, that is foul and will ruin my things and you'll have to pay for them\"  NTA", "ETA - him for not washing sheets and you for creating a rod through your back a few days before he\u2019s due to move out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he paid you rent, your TA but if he wasn\u2019t, the mattress is likely fine, so it seems like you just want to hurt/embarrass him over some sheets.

Do it.", "If he is ok sleeping in sheets that havent been washed in almost a year, why wouldnt he replace mine and continue using the ones he has slept in for almost a year? Seems fair to me.

I'm disgusted by several of the responses here that seem to think washing sheets and pillow cases isn't normal behavior, especially for an adult.\n\nMaybe there are a lot of users here who have parents that do that for them still and dont buy their own linens and furniture, it might explain it.", "If someone offered to let you live in their house and sleep in their furnished room, would you not make an attempt to keep it as clean as possible? I understand if it was a shared apartment with two names on a lease, your space is your space and your things are your things.\n\nI was raised that if you borrow or use something that someone else owns, you return it to them in the same condition or better.

I couldnt imagine laying in my filth for almost an entire year, let alone if someone else owned it.", "Do you not clean your sheets?", "Can you explain why? Seems like you assumed no strings were attached.\n\nThis is a grown man that was given a furnished bedroom that decided to never wash the items that weren't his. Do you consider never washing linens normal wear and tear? \n\nImagine if you went to a hotel and had dirty sheets, and they said sorry its normal wear and tear. Would you want them replaced?", "This is a grown man, he shouldnt need to be told to wash sheets that are not his. I'm am disgusted that several users here seem to think its ok to never wash sheets after almost a year of use.\n\nCan you explain more why you think its ok to not wash your sheets or pillow cases? Especially if you didn't pay for them?", "I have asked many times if he wanted to talk about things, and why he behaves the way he does. He gets very defensive and walks away. I have given up trying to figure it out.", "I think you mean ESH? ETA = edited to add", "maybe 1. he doesn't own a queen sized bed and 2. you haven't communicated to him about this at all so it would be really weird for him to take your bedsheets.", "Well no, he probably wouldn\u2019t mind taking them - paying for new ones is probably not something he was expecting to do, though.  Why did you only bring it up now and not a few months back?\n\nEdited: just saw you\u2019re okay if he just washes the stuff before he leaves, right? In that case then yeah, ask for replacements if he refuses to wash them. That\u2019s really bare minimum. But do brace yourself for refusal of both options.", "If you wanted him to buy new sheets at the end of his stay, that should have been communicated at the start. If it\u2019s about the washing, you should have told him that you expect him to wash them every month or whatever was your boundary and if not, you\u2019ll expect him to buy new sheets.

I can't imagine getting pillows, sheets and pillow cases for 50 euros. As in I can't imagine finding new stuff that costs that little total. If you buy good quality non-fancy stuff, I'd expect to look at least 200-ish euros (rough estimates, cheaper end, pre recent inflation: 1 pillow 20-40 euros, 1 duvet 60 euros, 1 pillow case and duvet cover set 70 euros, 1 mattress protector 30 euros). Then multiply if you buy more than one of something. But I'd also expect to be able to use them for the next 15 years with the infrequent use and good care they'd get.", "Doesnt smell great, thats what made me ask the question. A year of using the same sheets and pillow cases and never washing them.", "I think most people on here wash their sheets and pillow cases, I think you're missing the point a lot of people are trying to make, pretty much everyone thinks he is filthy for not cleaning the sheets on a regular basis, the main I guess opinion on here is YOU bought $500 worth of bedding and assumed he would be cleaning them, he didn't, unless you knew he was a clean freak, there is no way I'm spending $500 on bedding for someone EVER! You buy the cheapest crap or let them know before hand they need to provide their own!", "Lol, no, we wash our sheets but not everyone takes care of things, especially things they don't own.  Did you not know this about your friend? Going forward, should you rent the room again, I recommend that you outline your expectations, even if it seems like common courtesy or common sense. Some people will only do the bare minimum, and begrudgingly at that.", "If you cared, it\u2019s also on you to tell him your boundaries too. Also you don\u2019t get to bill him retrospectively without him agreeing in advance.", "you're confusing \"not cleaning\" with \"damaging\"", "He was using your items and you saw he wasn't washing them.\n\nWhy were you ok with him not washing your items?", "It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s that you could have communicated before this if you wanted him to wash them more often. Also that you assume the sheets are automatically damaged beyond repair. Tell him to throw them through the wash a couple times and dry in the sun. I bet they will smell and look fresh and new", "I'm talking about you trying to figure out stuff for him.\n\nI'm talking about recommending they seek help or therapy. If they still get defensive, then that's a tough spot to be in. Because, I feel for you, but I wouldn't try to penalize someone for having a mental illness, especially if they are unaware.\n\nUsually, when that happens it means it's been enabled their entire life either by bad parents, or they've been made to feel guilty so many times for having difficulty that they completely shut down. \n\nEither way, there's not much you personally can do for them. They'd need to see a counselor or a therapist.", "Like, when it comes to dealing with mental health, it takes time. For me personally it took years to realize what I was up against.\n\nI understand it's frustrating to live with, having been on both ends. But, if you use a little forgiveness, a lot of patience, and recommend therapy or seeking help instead of trying to fix it for him, it might go a long way, long term, even though it may not seem like it short term. \n\nJust some food for thought.", "That\u2019ll be the one!", "Exactly. The issue is that OP failed to communicate for way too long and then exploded. This isn\u2019t a healthy approach.", "He doesnt own sheets, so if he plans on using them at his new place, he will need to purchase them. I dont see how that is a surprise expense.\n\nHow much earlier should I have brought it up? After a month? Two? When he moved in I told him I like to try and keep the place clean. I'm not going to remind a grown man how to perform basic hygiene tasks. If he refuses to do it, he should accept that he should replace them if they're ruined.", "This is a fully grown adult living in someone else's home equipped with a washer and dryer. If he is fine with using dirty ass sheets, he can take them with him and replace mine. He would have to purchase new sheets for his new bed anyway right?", "You said unless it's damaged or stained, I'm not sure because I dont go in his space. I'd still like you to explain your mindset here too, seems very selfish and narcissistic in my mind to think treating other people's stuff like shit is ok.", "I get it. But you didn't say these sheets and bedding will need to be replaced by you if you can't keep them clean, sorry but you gotta be specific, he is filthy but under no actual obligation to replace them, hopefully he will do it, but you never told him he had to!", "You can buy a full set of bedding for like $35, though, he might not be expecting a $500 bill for linen replacement. \n\nI would\u2019ve brought it up like\u2026every single time I did my own sheets, so like once a week. And after a few refusals I would\u2019ve determined my guest isn\u2019t taking care of the space I\u2019m lending him and asked him to leave. I can\u2019t imagine nearly a year of building that resentment.", "And you're a fully grown adult who can communicate. You let him ruin your bed - you could've at any point set boundaries but you just kept it for yourself.", "I don\u2019t see why you think washing won\u2019t make your sheets clean at this point? You are in your rights to expect that he cleans them (and reimburses you if they are stained) or to pay for laundry service if he\u2019s too lazy to wash them. You can\u2019t just escalate to \u201cyou have to take them with you and you owe me $500\u201d", "if you fall in the mud with clothes on, do you just throw away your shirt and pants? no, that's ridiculous.  you wash them.\n\nyou can make dirty sheets clean again by washing them as well.  it sure costs a lot less than buying a whole new mattress, and a single wash cycle doesn't take enough time worth ruining a friendship for. i don't know why that's not an option in your mind.  are you a germaphobe?", "The 500 includes the mattress. Even with a mattress protector on (which ime usually aren\u2019t actually waterproof) the oils and dirt would\u2019ve likely seeped through into the mattress itself as well."]}
