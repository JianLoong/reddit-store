It's not a health issue that needs solidarity. She can go be vegan on her own time, pushing others to follow is the exact part of veganism everyone complains about.", "NTA.

Why stop now?\"", "NTA. this is her journey, not yours. if she feels uncomfortable around other meat eaters, she is never going to have a good time. does that mean she's gonna stay home every major holiday that serves hot dogs? bbq? is she gonna cringe cause you're in the mood for some ice cream on a hot day or wanting a pizza on your birthday? \n\nyou're not being manipulative, you're being firm on what you want. your diet is yours to control", "NTA. She asked you to quit eating meat and you said \"no\". She's not the asshole for asking, nor are you one for answering. It's her reaction that makes her a bit of an asshole. People eat meat. I don't understand why you have to quit for a week or two for the first stage of her lifestyle change. Is she asking this of her parents? Her friends?

I am whole food plant based, my partner is not. We have been together over 9 years.\n\nWhile your girlfriend has made a commitment to a particular diet/lifestyle, that does not mean you have to as well. If it is that big of a deal to her that her partner lives by the same lifestyle choices as her, then I don't see how a relationship will work for her with someone who eats meat. While I do not eat meat, I still cook meat for my partner, friends and family when we have get togethers because they do eat meat.

This is a decision she made on her own, and she can't expect others to bend the knee to her request.", "NTA. I can definitely see why you would hope that would be helpful, and why she didn't think so. She's probably really frustrated and changing one's diet is hard. I don't think it was manipulative on your end. Hopefully this was an irrational thing she said and you two can work through it. But I'd be on the look out for whether this is a consistent pattern of hers or a one off thing. If she consistently requires you to act like her to feel supported it's kind of a warning sign of unhealth in the relationship.", "NTA\n\nI've been vegan for 7 years now. When I met my now husband, he decided to give it a try. He lasted three months, it didn't work for him. He eats a mainly carnivorous diet now. \n\nDo I love watching him eat a steak or smell meat cooking at home? No. But it's his home too, I'm not going to tell him he can't.\n\nShe'll need to understand that she can't change what's going on around her.

Completely NTA from someone who's been vegetarian all of their adult life", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not really sure why you\u2019d be the Ah for not going to restaurants for a few weeks, since most restaurants are not vegan-friendly. That seems like the most reasonable approach, actually.

She dated you while being a meat eater, she should accept you like that.", "NTA. She is a prime example of why vegans have a reputation of being insufferable.", "NTA.

NTA.", "NTA. She does not get to control what you do. Period.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t ready to commit to being vegan. She wants to make this choice, and not being able to stand by it is a her problem.", "NTA - she says she doesn\u2019t need to put her social life on hold to live this vegan lifestyle, but she wants YOU to put your culinary preferences on hold for HER lifestyle.\n\nI\u2019m allergic to milk and eggs. When I go to an event and they have all kinds of sweets I can\u2019t eat, it sucks. But I grin and bear it and get my own vegan/safe stuff to eat when I get back home. I don\u2019t expect my parents or my friends to also ONLY eat vegan/safe stuff to make me feel comfortable.\n\nWhat you CAN do is try going to places that are all vegan or places that have vegan options sometimes. This would be supportive WITHOUT saying you have to give up meat completely.\n\nBecause she says 1-2 weeks, but if she needs someone else to stay strong in this new lifestyle, would it really stop there?", "NTA.

It\u2019s not like this is the result of a mutual conversation with the end goal being a more active lifestyle and better sex life as a couple.  This is her desire purely.\n\nTherefore, you\u2019re not at all obligated to give up anything for her veganism, and her expectation of you to give up something YOU love for it is awfully self-centered.", "NTA. If she\u2019s serious, she\u2019s not going to let other people eating meat bother her. I was vegetarian for a few years, and I still cooked meat for my family the whole time. Your friends are wrong - she\u2019s obviously the one trying to manipulate.", "NTA\n\nYou should not feel guilty or obligated to do something that you do not want to do, just to make your girlfriend happy. \n\nI'd argue that SHE is the one who's being manipulative; it's not fair to expect you to give up meat just to make her feel more comfortable.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been vegan for six years, and honestly watching other people eat meat and cheese doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s not going into my body so why should I care? \n\nBaby vegans can sometimes get hung up on evangelizing about the horrors of the animal meat to everyone they know. In time she\u2019ll either realize she can (and should) only control what she chooses for her body, or she\u2019ll fall further down the slippery slope and end up one of those weirdos that makes their cat go vegan.", "NTA vegans like your gf are insufferable.", "If anything she's being a little manipulative, not you. She's giving you the silent treatment thinking you'll buckle and give up meat for a couple weeks, when you really don't want to. If she wants to see your friends as well, is she expecting them to go vegan for a couple weeks too? NTA.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t get to impose lifestyle changes on you. You probably shouldn\u2019t have told her to stop going out, but in my mind this echoes all the stories about recovering alcoholics trying to ban alcohol at holiday parties the past month on this sub. Her lifestyle change is her responsibility, if she needs more help sticking to that change she should seek out that help. Controlling what your partner eats isn\u2019t helping anyone, it just builds resentment.", "NTA. She has her own dietary restriction, it's not like a health issue.

She chose not to be, he supports that.", "NTA\n\nIt's not fair to demand that from you.", "NTA. Becoming a vegan was her own choice, and that's very immature and egoistical of her to demand you to give up on meat just because she changed her lifestyle. It seems to me that she tried to manipulate and victim blame you.\nI hope you two could come to a compromise. If not, than that's a red flag for me, because she does not respect your lifestyle.", "NTA:  I used to know a Vegan who forced her BF to join her, every chance he got he was eating meat in secret.  Why do people insist of forcing other to follow their dietary choices?", "NTA but I also don\u2019t understand why you proposed this. If you\u2019re still going to eat meat in front of her at home (which is completely understandable!), how does not going to restaurants help?", "NTA. You need to have a serious talk with her because this is not a 2 week compromise. This is going to get worse. And also your \"friends\" have absolutely 0 say in this.

I am happy to support you as much as possible with this, however, I am not changing my lifestyle to match your new dietary restrictions, I am happy with my current lifestyle and I am not going to change my diet just for the sake of it.

I mean, unless she switches to cannibalism, then all bets are off), but that you won\u2019t be changing your diet.

Ask her how she thinks you can help. Work together. \n\nNow, if your delivery to being told that she felt uncomfortable with other people eating meat was to yell and say \u201cFINE!

And it matters where she\u2019s looking for influence. \n\nThe online vegan community is a toxic place, full of bullies (not special, just like most ideologies). There\u2019s an insane amount of pressure to be a \u2018good vegan\u2019, which some people define as refusing to be anywhere near animal products. \n\nI would dig a bit deeper, because she\u2019s already displayed some contradictions here. \nNot wanting to be around others that eat meat but won\u2019t \u2018put her social life on hold\u2019 by not going out don\u2019t reconcile.

I'm not saying you don't care. That is just how this looks. She isn't asking you to make a lifestyle change, just for you to help with hers. I'm sure you can find other things to eat so she won't feel like she's being punished.", "I'm going to go YTA, but hear me out.\n\nYour GF is making a huge change in her life.  I don't know her reasons: perceived health benefits, animal welfare concerns, joining the bandwagon, whatever.

And she has asked you for support.\n\nHow often do you eat out?  Twice a week maybe?  So she's asking you for four meals without meat to help her with making the change.  And yes, I know you said your compromise is to just not go out, but she wants to normalise being vegan in a social setting for herself.\n\nThe bigger thing that I consider in all this isn't the meat/no meat, it's that she asked you for a small sacrifice to support her and you refused.  Being in a relationship is about mutual support.  If you guys end up going the distance then throughout your life together you are both going to make bigger sacrifices to support each other; illness, children, redundancies, illness and death of loved ones, etc.   If you're not prepared to acknowledge that she is worth your support then why are you with her?  \n\nIf you do love her and want to be with her then support her.  Have a burger for lunch, eat vegan for dinner with her.
