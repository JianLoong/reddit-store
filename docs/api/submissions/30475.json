I found him and asked him to move. He told me he needed 30 min and I said I can\u2019t wait I have to pick my kids up at school.  He asked how long I could wait and I said 10 min. He got upset with me, and said fine, he would move in 10. He moved after 15, and I got to school 2 min after pickup and my daughter was waiting in the office. When I got back he was blocking my driveway again, I couldn\u2019t find him. I parked on the street and texted my neighbor. He asked him to move, but he didn\u2019t move for an hour. \n\nEarly last week he parked blocking my driveway again, fortunately while I was out. I parked on the street and I couldn\u2019t find him, I texted the neighbor again, who tracked him down and got him to move. It still took him an hour to move. Then last Friday I got parked in again, and the contractor was on the roof. He said he couldn\u2019t come down until he finished things. I texted my neighbor and he said he was out and the contractor wasn\u2019t answering. I had to get a ride from someone else to get my kids. The contractor was still there when I got back, so I called parking enforcement and they came and gave the contractor a ticket for blocking my driveway. \n\nThe neighbor is pissed and called me an asshole for calling parking enforcement and since I was able to get a ride from someone else I should have let it go. He also said his contractor is pissed and wants me to pay the fine. However, every time I asked him he gave me attitude or took a long time and my neighbor couldn\u2019t get him to move either. So I think I am justified in calling parking enforcement after this happening multiple times.", "created_utc": 1699326019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pkr07/aita_for_calling_parking_enforcement_on_my/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was just being pissy because you told him to move his ass.\n\nYou're nicer than me. A ticket is nothing. I would've had him towed.", "Wow, what a jerk to block your driveway not once but multiple times!  He should have apologized profusely the first time.  You're clearly NTA for having him get a ticket for doing something multiple times illegally.  Kids need to be picked up now, not in 15 min.  You're NTA, but if he blocks again, immediately call to have him towed and don't ask your neighbor, you've been too nice.", "NTA.  If he needed to block a driveway, it should have been the house of his employer. Any good contractor knows they\u2019re not supposed to inconvenience the neighbors like that.\n\nAs for the fine, when you park illegally, you risk fines.  That was his choice.", "NTA, he should not be blocking your driveway at all. If he blocks your driveway again. Don't call the neighbor or the contractor just call the police again better yet call a tow truck company and have him towed away.", "NTA Keep calling them and set up a lawn chair, drinking a beverage,  while you\u2019re waiting for them to arrive.   \n\n\nThen write a Yelp review about how he terrorizes the neighbors while works.", "NTA. Of course the contractor is mad, he thinks he can do whatever the fuck he wants and people should just deal with it. I'm a bit surprised that your neighbor is pissed, and I would venture to guess that if roles were reversed they wouldn't be as patient and polite as you have been. \n\n\nStand your ground, OP, and don't give in to them trying to get you to pay the fines.  You've done nothing wrong, and it's important to show them that you can't be manipulated or intimidated into doing something they want you to do.", "I'd recommend a call to the local building department to make sure permits were pulled for the work.  I'd also consider a public complaint on local social media with a picture of the truck if he does it again.", "NTA \n\nContractor was doing it all week and knew you needed your driveway.    \n  \nHe's an ass and your neighbor is as well.  \n\nTell them you'll call enforcement every time your driveway is blocked.", "You were a lot more patient than I would have been. Clearly this is going to continue to be an issue unless you do something about it. These people have zero respect for you. Asking you to pay the bill?! The audacity.\n\nNTA.", "Get the friend who gave you the ride to write you up a bill for it.

You can\u2019t be held hostage in your own home. And if he got ticketed, that just means he was in the wrong.", "NTA. Why wasn't he blocking your neighbor's driveway instead of yours? You shouldn't have to ask him to move. Not sure what country you live in, but if a parking enforcement exists then it is probably always illegal for someone to block someone else's driveway. You were too nice in my opinion. Unless it's some form of emergency vehicle blocking my driveway they're getting the cops called on the as soon as they refuse to move at the exact moment I ask them to move. No waiting. I also wouldn't be asking if it happened again on separate days. I'd be getting them towed right away.", "NTA\n\nHe's lucky you didn't get his vehicle towed. You tried to be nice, and the neighbor and contractor walked all over you. Tell them no, you're not paying the ticket and if he does it again, you'll have him ticketed again AND towed.", "NTA. Entitlement have no cure.", "NTA\n\nId have called the first time. Everyone knows you don't block driveways.", "NTA - you gave him more than enough chances", "NTA.\n\nHell I wouldve called parking enforcement the moment I came home and not be able to access my driveway after already having a conversation about it.", "INFO: Why wasn't the contractor blocking the driveway of the house he was working at?", "NTA. You have the patience of a saint as it is.", "NTA. Call parking enforcement EVERY TIME.", "NTA, stop calling the contractor or the neighbor, and go directly to parking enforcement. That's the only language they will listen to. Choices have consequences, they've made their choices. If they retaliate document and report them to the police. You can use the police reports as evidence if you ever need to go to court.", "NTA - Blocking someone's driveway is a selfish and illegal move in the first place. You gave him several chances to stop. Make sure to have that number on speed dial in case he does it again.", "NTA, not your fault you've got a real slow learner on your hands.  Anybody who pulled this shit on me would get towed, not just a ticket. You've been too lenient if anything, don't give him any more warnings and call immediately if he does it again.", "NTA - The contractor should not be blocking your point of egress, especially after you politely discussed it with them. This is their fault, not yours.\n\nYou were totally justified.", "NTA,  your neighbor and the contractor at AH.  If it happened 2x over 3 weeks, that\u2019s inconvenient.  This many times is ridiculous.  If the contractor or neighbor has anything else to say, respond with next time I\u2019m calling a tow truck company.

Tell the neighbor and the contractor they\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t call enforcement each and every time prior to that instance. But you will going forward.  If you have space on your street that you can park without blocking anyone, the contractor can too.  Report it every time from now on.", "NTA. After the first time, he did t think to find an alternative spot?", "NTA. Tell your neighbor that if he does it again, you\u2019ll call again. And keep doing so. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. It\u2019s just rude.", "Fuck this guy NTA I would of had his ass towed. Self entitled contractors are so annoying. I personally worked for one of these guys and it drove me insane how inconsiderate he could be. Would double park at jobs, take up multiple spots in small parking lots. An generally would act like he owned the building on every job we worked on.", "NTA OP.  It\u2019s your driveway that the contractor was blocking, and it appears that you did everything to resolve the situation before escalating to calling parking enforcement.", "NTA. What kind of asshat blocks driveways this much??", "I\u2019m not sure why you didn\u2019t call parking enforcement sooner. At the moment he asks \u201chow long can you wait\u201d the answer is 2 minutes and there are no further interactions just parking enforcement immediately. No further warnings are necessary.\n\nNTA tell him to fuck off and be prepared to get another one if he does it again.", "NTA call parking enforcement again if he blocks you in and definitely don\u2019t pay his ticket.", "Next time call the Tow company and have it towed.", "NTA.

He offered me AUD$150 for me to have my car parked on the street for two days but renegotiated for five days.\n\nIf the neighbour and your neighbour's contractor wants to disrupt your use of your driveway, they need to get permission. Why isn't the neighbour letting the contractor use his driveway?", "NTA tell neighbour the contractor can learn to park responsibly, in the neighbour's yard, or neighbour can foot the parking ticket that will come every time contractor parks in front of your driveway.", "Not sure why you have to ask when it\u2019s so obvious that you are NTA. Fuck that contractor. I\u2019d keep calling parking enforcement every time.", "NTA. I would have called parking enforcement the second time he parked there.", "YTA. I needed to park there so deliveries could access the neighbors drive.  Plus it\u2019s a shorter walk.  My legs can only take so much going up and down ladders all day because I\u2019m a little over weight.  Have a heart.  Your kids can enjoy some extra time with their friends and teachers.
