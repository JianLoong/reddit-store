I found him and asked him to move. He told me he needed 30 min and I said I can\u2019t wait I have to pick my kids up at school.  He asked how long I could wait and I said 10 min. He got upset with me, and said fine, he would move in 10. He moved after 15, and I got to school 2 min after pickup and my daughter was waiting in the office. When I got back he was blocking my driveway again, I couldn\u2019t find him. I parked on the street and texted my neighbor. He asked him to move, but he didn\u2019t move for an hour. \n\nEarly last week he parked blocking my driveway again, fortunately while I was out. I parked on the street and I couldn\u2019t find him, I texted the neighbor again, who tracked him down and got him to move. It still took him an hour to move. Then last Friday I got parked in again, and the contractor was on the roof. He said he couldn\u2019t come down until he finished things. I texted my neighbor and he said he was out and the contractor wasn\u2019t answering. I had to get a ride from someone else to get my kids. The contractor was still there when I got back, so I called parking enforcement and they came and gave the contractor a ticket for blocking my driveway. \n\nThe neighbor is pissed and called me an asshole for calling parking enforcement and since I was able to get a ride from someone else I should have let it go. He also said his contractor is pissed and wants me to pay the fine. However, every time I asked him he gave me attitude or took a long time and my neighbor couldn\u2019t get him to move either.
