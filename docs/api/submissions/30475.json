I found him and asked him to move. He told me he needed 30 min and I said I can\u2019t wait I have to pick my kids up at school.  He asked how long I could wait and I said 10 min. He got upset with me, and said fine, he would move in 10. He moved after 15, and I got to school 2 min after pickup and my daughter was waiting in the office. When I got back he was blocking my driveway again, I couldn\u2019t find him. I parked on the street and texted my neighbor. He asked him to move, but he didn\u2019t move for an hour. \n\nEarly last week he parked blocking my driveway again, fortunately while I was out. I parked on the street and I couldn\u2019t find him, I texted the neighbor again, who tracked him down and got him to move. It still took him an hour to move. Then last Friday I got parked in again, and the contractor was on the roof. He said he couldn\u2019t come down until he finished things. I texted my neighbor and he said he was out and the contractor wasn\u2019t answering. I had to get a ride from someone else to get my kids. The contractor was still there when I got back, so I called parking enforcement and they came and gave the contractor a ticket for blocking my driveway. \n\nThe neighbor is pissed and called me an asshole for calling parking enforcement and since I was able to get a ride from someone else I should have let it go. He also said his contractor is pissed and wants me to pay the fine. However, every time I asked him he gave me attitude or took a long time and my neighbor couldn\u2019t get him to move either.

You can\u2019t block a driveway\u2026. even your own. You don\u2019t own the street. I don\u2019t think someone can be the AH when the other person is doing something illegal. Ever.", "NTA, why is he not blocking your neighbors drive? This is ridiculous and not your problem. Your neighbor needs to make clear to people he hires not to block your driveway", "I drive a cement mixer. I\u2019m always blocking somebody, but I\u2019ll be considerate when I can. Pull up to a job and have to wait? I\u2019ll pull up in front of the lawn. Washing out? Same.\n\nHowever when I\u2019m pouring I may be blocking a driveway or a whole road. I give people the wrist watch signal then give them a 5 minute signal or whatever. They either turn around or wait it out. Soon as I\u2019m done I\u2019m happy to move.\n\nI know contractors like this, believe me, they are a headache all around, guy was just mad because he\u2019s simply put one of those grumpy contractors.", "At this point why does OP care what any of these a holes think.", "NTA. I would've skipped enforcement and called a tow company directly. Decent people don't block driveways when they park.", "Why couldn\u2019t he park in the driveway of the house he was renovating?   \n\nNTA.  You tried, he didn\u2019t. He can pay the fine \n\nTell the neighbours: imagine if this was you trying to get your car out?   You\u2019d be upset too.", "NTA. Run a magnet over your driveway though. Might want to have a camera there too", "NTA", "You know you are not the asshole... Why the need for this?", "NTA.  You went above and beyond and were a doormat to their contractor\u2019s bad behavior.  And they want you to pay the fine?  How hard did you laugh at that one? \ud83d\ude02", "NTA: Your first two interactions were completely reasonable. The fact that they couldn't even bother to ask you IF they could block your legally protected access to your property puts this well into your favor.", "NTA.\n\nContractor wasn't listening or responding like an adult.\n\nWTF does neighbor care?   He's not inconvenienced by OP escalating this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBoth contractor and neighbors are major AHs", "Too bad you didn't call sooner", "NTA.

Tell him next time you are calling a tow service first.", "NTA but you gave way too many chances. That time it took him an hour, I would have called at 10-15 min", "NTA\n\nI'd tell them both to go hammer dog shit. Bet he doesn't block any driveways again either.", "I would have called the first time and the second time I would have had him towed. \n\nNTA", "Yeah far nicer to me. If a neighbor came to be ahead of time and said hey I gotta park here for a few because of this reason, I'd let them. That said there isn't much of a reason to block my driveway.\n\nI get in my car to leave and my driveway is blocked with no heads up? I'm getting that car towed.", "he's just asking for more tickets and at some point to be towed", "Agreed, I would have started calling parking enforcement the first time, and kept doing it every time until they brought a tow truck to tow away the vehicle and impound it. If you can't find a parking space you park where you can and walk. It's what I do, and I'm literally disabled. If he needs his truck close by then he needs to make arrangements with the people he's working for to park in their drive. Blocking someone else's drive is dick move territory.  \n\nNTA - Tell neighbor that if anyone infringes on your drive Parking Enforcement will be on speed dail going forward. If that doesn't work talk to the impound lot and get one of those signs to put at the end of the drive saying anyone parking there will be towed at owners expense. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's like with delivery guys they have to find a spot to get out and get to your door but it must suck in big cities to find a spot . I'm really curious why there is no space at the nieghbours yard for the car .", "There are plenty of shitty contractors out there they do this.", "So you don't support government extortion but you support taking things in your own hands and cause disproportionate damage, but it's alright because no one can prove you did and the nails had a right to be there\n\nGrow up.

Rather than literally summon the police to extort and harass the man id prefer to take matters into my own hands.\n\nPlus like i said, i unintentionally dropped some shit no one will run over anyway. Its ILLEGAL to block someones driveway and the mans been explicitly instructed not to do so so even if the nails are there on purpose which they're not it was an accident then it shouldn't matter because only a jackass with no regard for the law would park there.\n\nThe police are not your friends dude", "I just wonder why he didn't use another spot . All I'm saying is that we build so many houses so close to each other but there is often no parking space. In my city they made the parkinglots smaller I guess to get one extra spot but they totally don't care how you suppose to get out of the car all they care is that theoretically you can get a parking spot . it is impossible to find a spot after 5pm not enough parking space. I get it that he shouldn't block others but the main focus should be that there is not enough parking space in many places . It doesn't mean he should block the neighbour all I'm saying it must be stressful to drive to work and not know where to park because everything is full. I doubt he would bother the neighbour if there was another option"]}
