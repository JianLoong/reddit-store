The simple fact that you jump right to kids threats shows you are too immature for them anyway. You realize he believes you and your friends are mentally ill, and you stay with him... a fight won't change the way he thinks, maybe just hide it, only for it to rear its ugly head later.", "NTA. He\u2019s showing you who he is, and you\u2019re not an asshole for making it clear that you don\u2019t want to have kids with someone like that. What if one of your kids turns out to be gay? It\u2019s clear you disagree about conversion camps. He doesn\u2019t respect YOUR sexuality as a bi person. He\u2019s a walking, talking red flag. Be careful, my friend", "\"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time\" Maya Angelou.\n\nNTA\n\nTime to break up I'm afraid. No good can come of this.", "NTA", "NTA dump him; he sucks.", "Blah blah blah", "NTA - reasonable to have a red line like this. However, it would appear you have reached the end of the line with your relationship", "Have kids with him anyway do it no balls", "NTA. Why? Because you're not straight. If he's going to view gay people like whilst being with a queer person, that isn't going to be viable. Ever. You're going to support your queer child. Hes going to be against them. \n\nWhatever the general view is on being queer or trans doesn't even matter here. 2 people like this can't viably have children together.", "Why would you want to be in a relationship with him moving forward? While the argument was unpleasant, he has made his views perfectly clear and from what you have said, do not match with yours.", "I would dump him for that. NTA", "YTA.  For not dumping him.", "YTA for refusing to have kids with him, because what you should be doing is refusing to date him. Boy, bi", "NTA. Your boyfriend is full blown homophobic and you're not going to be able to change that.", "Girl.", "Absolutely NTA. First off, homophobes are always TA. Second off, you can have kids with whoever (and whenever) you wish. Even if you guys had gotten all ready to do it and then you backed out last minute, you STILL wouldn\u2019t be TA. Your body, you choice.\n\nAnd for the people telling you that you\u2019re thinking about this too soon, YOU ARE NOT. While I don\u2019t think you should have kids right now (get settled and stable first, for your and the kid(s) sakes), this is one of those big things when picking a partner. Not/wanting kids makes or breaks relationships. So testing the waters with the idea is actually a very responsible thing to do early on. \n\nAnd while some aspects of parenting styles can be figured out in the process, there\u2019s a lot that needs to be agreed on beforehand, too! This is definitely  a conflict of parenting styles. Plus, this was brought up in a stressful situation where you were wondering if your hypothetical kids (and you, now and in the future!) would be safe around him.\n\nHonestly, get out of there rn. Like someone else in the comments said, there\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019ll respect you or your friends\u2019 identities. There\u2019s also no guarantee that you\u2019ll be safe. While yes, I\u2019m making assumptions, I always assume that hateful people are violent. This has gotten me out of bad situations more than once. You know him better than I do, obviously. If you\u2019ve EVER had a legitimate doubt that you\u2019re safety is in question, leave if you have the opportunity to. And tell people your plan so that you can be safe as you\u2019re doing so. I hope everything goes well for you, OP.", "NTA\n\nIt's a good thing to avoid kids with him. But knowing he harbors bigotry, why stay with him at all?", "Don;t walk, RUN! from this relationship.

I'm curious though, he seems like the classic homophobic asshole who cannot comprehend anything beyond heteronormativity\u2014 does he know you're bisexual?", "NTA dump his homophobic ass", "Don't waste time on a bigot. Throw the whole man away.  NTA", "Nta. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds like a close-minded fool. \n\nIf you and your partner\u2019s ideals and beliefs dont align then its just not going to work out. You dont need to walk the same path but its important that your paths go in the same general direction.", "NTA, but you sound very incompatible. You're bisexual, and he doesn't respect LGBTQ people. So that means he inherently doesn't respect you, either. He probably tells himself he \"converted\" you, and yes, if you had children who turned out to be gay, it sounds like he would likely abuse them. Conversion therapy is abuse, and many of those places are absolutely horrific.", "NTA. He's just not the guy for you. (Or anyone else who expects him to be logical and reasonable and to show appreciation for all people.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want to have his kids, but you want to still be with him.

A man that was born in 2000 to be so homophobic is someone so closeminded that not only he is not father material, he is not boyfriend material.

Someone sharing the same values as you will come across as a more reliable partner. \n\nNTA.", "I'm a gay female myself and I can attest to the fact that a lot of us are mentally ill in that most  of us (I include myself and friends) were in some way sexually abused as children and have lasting issues  about it.

Lolol.", "Well the fight did just happen tonight so that\u2019s what I\u2019m figuring out. He said it would be a dumb thing to end it over but honestly idk if I wanna waste more time  with someone who I don\u2019t see much of a future with anymore.

That's like saying \"kill all blacks.\" You do not maintain relations with those kind of people.", "This is gross", "What? The boyfriend said he thinks gays are mentally ill. He has communicated what he believes - that he is a bigot.", "Uhm, this is a little more than needing \u201copen communication\u201d for their relationship to work out. Just like being straight isn\u2019t a mental condition, neither is being queer. So the fact that he thinks it is isn\u2019t just wildly uneducated but also worrying considering, like OP said, she was considering the option of having kids with him in the future. \n\nThis is the kind of situation where you (a) wouldn\u2019t have kids with them for the safety of said kids or (b) leave the relationship so that\u2019s not a worry in the first place. There\u2019s also the rare occurrence of (c) where one of them changes their views, but that\u2019s\u2026 highly unlikely. When it comes to human rights, most people don\u2019t just change their views like that unless something truly hits hard for them\u2014 and some people can rationalize situations so there\u2019s no cognitive dissonance in the first place, which negates changing their viewpoints.\n\nPlus, when it comes to believing that certain types of people shouldn\u2019t have rights/should have less rights, you never know for certain whether or not they could end up being violent.", "This is terrible advice. Homophobia isn't a belief that is acceptable. The guy literally said he thinks being gay is a mental illness and would send any gay children to conversion therapy. That's not ok. That's not just a small belief. That is a core belief about people that is definitely worth breaking up over, just like racism, sexism, etc. Some things you do not tolerate.
