My husband and I are extremely proud of her for making this choice, and we hope it's effective for her.\u00a0\n\nHer mental health issues have been mild to moderate anxiety and depression, and she has (in my non-professional opinion) very unhealthy relationships with her parents, which limit her ability to function as an adult and especially as a parent. She is a SAHM, but my in-laws (Ray and Kay) spend almost every day with the kids and keep them for up to two weeks at a time. Her in-laws (Will and Jill) also care for the children regularly, but not to the level that Ray and Kay do.\n\nWhen SIL entered treatment, her husband was scheduled to fly out for a month-long work trip. She gave no notice before entering treatment, so he was unable to get out of it and left yesterday, so the children have been with Ray and Kay, as they usually would be. He says he is working on getting home as soon as possible, but we've seen him use work as a reason to not be present for tough times, so I'm not sure how true that is.\n\nSIL's therapist immediately recognized the codependent nature of her and her parents' relationship and strongly recommended that Ray and Kay not do any childcare while they work on their relationship, so Will and Jill took the children instead. We are thrilled that 1. the therapist caught on to this so fast and 2. SIL was willing to upset her parents to move the children to better care. SIL has done stints like this before, but no changes were made to how she cared for the children or lived her life, so it wasn't effective. This one seems much more promising, and we want to be very supportive of the process.\n\nWill and Jill took the children, as suggested, but they have cut all contact between the kids and Ray and Kay completely, which wasn't how we understood it would be. The kids are understandably confused and miss Ray and Kay, who are begging us to take the kids instead, so that they can have contact with them, but we are hesitant for the following reasons:\n\n1. We don't live nearby. Logistically, we could make it work, but with all the flight cancellations lately, it's possible we wouldn't even be able to get there.\n2. The kids are more used to being cared for by Will and Jill than they would be by us. We've never had them overnight. They have been affected by these unhealthy behaviors and have their own issues now, making them challenging to care for.\n3. Ray and Kay need to prioritize SIL's mental health right now, not focus on what they want. It's only two weeks, and then SIL can dictate the relationship moving forward (which I guess could continue to be cut-off, which is their fear).\n\nI feel like we all just need to get through the two weeks and let SIL figure it out with her new coping skills.

And if R/K are regular caregivers (moreso than W/J), having them taken away from them and placed elsewhere is removing the only continuity these kids have. And now theyre cut off completely? That means the kids are also cut off from their regular caregivers completely. This doesn\u2019t sound healthy for the kids at all, who are going through it alongside everyone else. \n\nThe therapist, the husband, and Will and Jill are the assholes. If R/K are abusive, I could understand. Otherwise, this is too drastic. But you are n t a since you don\u2019t seem to be a solid daily presence in their lives, either.

It doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea to completely cut off the grandparents contact with the kids, and I can\u2019t understand why this happened, since you said nothing negative about their assistance.

By requesting u to take care of the kids, they don't consider anyone elses feelings just their own. They want to get their need to be near the kids met and they don't care how it will happen. By taking the kids, you would enable their codependency and also undermine the therapists work who decided with your SIL this way for a reason. It is not you who is keeping them out of contact with their grandkids, but the consequences of their actions. Who and when has access to kids is the parents decision. I would suggest to keep holding the wall and staying out of the problem if the impulse is not coming from SIL herself.

The kids are safe and this situation is TEMPORARY! It doesn't matter if Ray and Kay are not getting contact for *a couple of weeks*, it's not the end of the world!! Frankly it sounds more alarming that you are so willing to jump in and interfere when NEITHER parent has asked for it. You need to stay out of this. Their MOTHER is still running the show, she's in therapy not in a COMA! In fact, if you try to take the kids without the parent's permission - it's called KIDNAPPING. .\n\nEdit, changing my judgment to NTA.", "This isn't really an AITA post.\n\nAnd this family situation is messy, but is not really appropriate for you to get involved right now. The only concern is, do the kids have safe and willing care. And they do.\n\nWhatever is going on with your SIL, inpatient stays are to get stabilized. And her marriage (with completely absent spouse), are the parents who will decide what's best for their kids in the future.\n\nIt sounds like Ray and Kay are getting anxious and anticipating a big change, and the best thing to do is listen to them and encourage them to get their own therapy. If you also see this unhealthy codependency dynamic then you might say something like, I can see how hard it is for you not to be the ones taking the kids right now.  Or - I hear you're worried that you might be excluded going forward. And also you can confirm- the kids are safe and that's what matters most. \n\nBut yeah. Shifts and changes in families do not require an all hands on deck response, especially if you're a flight away. \n\nIf you're finding that flying in \"to save the day\" is programmed in to you or your spouse, this is a good \"check engine light\" to get into your own therapy too. Codependent patterns in families run deep and the parents are sending out the \"activate!\" Signal. But you don't need to do what they say, and it's worth examining what happens in each of you when they call. Your spouse may be deeply wired to drop everything and help and it's a chance to sit down and examine the family programming. Of course, not going can create even more anxiety in the parents, so be prepared for it to stir up before it calms down.", "NTA.\nWhat level of access R&K have with the kids is between their son in law, daughter and W&J.\nStay out of it.\n\nIf it comes to it, the person to be drawing up and enforcing boundaries is the children\u2019s father, who can tell his own parents to let them see R&K, or tell R&K that he supports his mother\u2019s decision that everyone needs a break. \nBeing away on business doesn\u2019t give him an out. \n\n\nSIL should be resting and recovering and working on herself: not refereeing family arguments.\n\nYour only role should be to tell your brother to step up, decide the boundaries he is comfortable with and ensure he communicates them to all 4 grandparents.", "True. We haven't had direct contact with the therapist (only the grandparents and BIL are on the contact list), but we have with Ray and Kay and Will and Jill. My husband didn't press it too hard, but Jill did say that the no-contact was her idea \"just to get a clean reset.\" So we don't think the therapist requested the no-contact. This is one reason I feel bad, because Will and Jill are kind of making their own decisions that might have to do with jealousy of Ray and Kay being much more involved with the grandkids than they are.", "There are a lot of unhealthy dynamics and we're very hopeful that this treatment will be the catalyst to major changes, including in BIL's life, but yeah, that's a nice way for me to say exactly what you said.", "I have my own kids, so I could certainly keep them all alive, but Ray and Kay absolutely do want to take the children. My SIL is not letting them, so they want to at least be able to contact them if they're with me.", "We do have children who are very well cared for by us and not Ray and Kay, which is a very purposeful decision.", "Because we hear everything secondhand, it sounds like SIL does want the kids to still have contact with Ray and Kay, just for them not to do any childcare for them. Will and Jill are the ones who have seemingly decided the no-contact.", "They are both under six. I'm not sure what all they have been told as to what's going on.

Ray and Kay are learning that we are not going to drop everything to come save their days or SIL\u2019s days. My main reason for feeling like the asshole is that I don\u2019t know how well cared for the children are. Physically, I know they\u2019re fine, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily in a better emotional place with Will and Jill and no contact with Ray and Kay, but I recognize that we need to just stay out of it and support SIL in her decisions when she\u2019s better equipped to make them.", "Or maybe, instead of jealousy, they are trying to help not feed into the cycle of codependency more, especially when that seems to be a huge factor in your SIL's mental health. \n\nThey aren't saying \"we're taking custody of the kids forever and they'll never see the other grandparents again\" ... they're saying \"we're going to take these 2 weeks as a reset\". Which is perfectly reasonable and as long as the kids are being cared for, probably even a healthy thing. \n\nIt sounds to me like Ray and Kay are more concerned with how *they* feel than what's best for the kids at this moment - to the point of trying to rope you (an unfamiliar overnight caregiver) into a logistically tricky role - just so *they* can see the kids during this time.", "Its really concering that your SIL is *in the hospital* and her parents are throwing a tantrum over *two weeks*.\n\nThat is an incredibly reasonable amount of time to not be around their grandchildren or even go without a call.\n\nFrankly it wouldnt surprise me if Bill and Jill's decision was only made after the tantrum over the change in plans.\n\nAlso - have you spoken to the children directly?\n\nHave *they* said *without prompting* (ie. If you said \"do you miss grandma and grandpa that's prompting and they likely know it's rude to say no) that they're confused and miss them?\n\nBecause its been *a day*.\n\nEither Ray and Kay are lying to you to manipulate you - or this is throwing up red flags.\n\nThe grandchildren should not be distressed by one day without their grandparents.\n\nI could understand if it was a week in missing them, but SIL started treatment yesterday.\n\nThe kids should not have been negatively impacted by staying with Bill and Jill for one day - and seeing as a therapist immediately pegged Ray and Kay's relationship with their daughter as unhealthy, it's likely their relationship with their grandchildren is as well.", "Check the other comments below, I agree with them.\n\nIt's only been one day. Grandparents can survive 2 weeks. And the kids are been taking care of. \n\nTake a deep breath. I suppose you're been dragged into this so Ray and Kay get what they want, not what is better for SIL and the kids. It's always been their way, their wants. Not one comment on what's best for SIL and kids.\n\nJill maybe out of line, but that's for BIL and SIL to say. If they don't say it, it's definitely not your place. Don't fight battles you can only loose, either with Grandparents or with parents. Or even both. \n\nAre you sure the kids are been taking care of? Are they in a safe place with needs met? Then it's all meddling you're supposed to do. \n\nNEEDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WANTS. The kids and SIL *need* time and space. Grandparents *want* to have the kids. \n\nAnd as said before, it all sounds like a power move from Ray and Jay. They have a toxic behavior with SIL, do you think is a healthy one with grandkids?", "So you are considering going around your SIL's wishes because her problematic parents want it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlanning to abduct the kids?", "If the therapist tells you that you have to stop contact with Ray and Kay - are you prepared to do that?\n\nAre you qualified to recognize unhealthy behavior from your in laws and make the choice to cut contact if it's in the children's best interests?\n\nIf not then don't take them. You can't do a good job and you need to face that you're prioritizing toxic, likely abusive, people whose actions have led to their daughter needing intensive medical treatment - over the health and welfare of two children.", "Smart.  \n\nIf you took in your niblings, Ray and Kay would be all up in your business.  Stay away from all of this.", "If SIL wants her kids to be able to talk/see her parents while she gone, it should of been made known. I think Will & Jill have the kids best interest at heart and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have the children call Ray & Kay. But right now it\u2019s all about what\u2019s best for SIL, who probably shouldn\u2019t be bothered with issues like this while she\u2019s trying to better her mental health, and for her kids. Her husband can also have a say in this even if he can not be home to take care of the children himself.", "YOu are just as bad as ray and kay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIL let the other grandparents take responsibility, so it is THEIR decission .. not YOURS, not KAY's, not RAY's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRESPECT YOUR SIL'S decission.", "God some people don't realise these types of action breaks kids. There are making a rollercoaster of life for their kids. Kids need affection from people. As you said being apart from mom child are not emotional intimate with them but there were intame with there grandparents.

People might not know but kids are good observers but bad expressers so they will notice the condition of mommy", "I didn\u2019t read abuse. But 2 weeks being NC with two of their main caregivers while mom is inpatient treatment and dad is somewhere else? That\u2019s very drastic for 2 kids under 6. I can\u2019t even imagine how they feel rn. Sounds too tumultuous and sudden.", "Good, because this situation sounds like a slow moving train wreck, you don't want to be involved in!", "Frankly, Will and Jill raised my BIL, who is still on his work trip, so I\u2019m not that confident in their behavior being in the kids\u2019 best interests either. I think I feel the worst because we\u2019re the best parents in general in the scenario by a long shot, but it\u2019s two weeks and I think we just should get through it and let SIL take the lead when she\u2019s done.", "My SIL hasn\u2019t expressed that she wants no contact between them. All we\u2019ve heard from both Ray and Kay and Will and Jill is that Ray and Kay should not be doing any childcare at this time.", "I would love to stop contact with Ray and Kay, and we have minimal contact with them as is. That\u2019s a big reason we aren\u2019t on my SIL\u2019s contact list. I would not allow them to dictate how we cared for the kids if we cared for them, but I don\u2019t want to even be in that position.", "The hard part is that the No contact was not my SIL\u2019s decision. Ray and Kay are not to do childcare, but the No contact was Jill\u2019s decision.", "They are still with their grandparents. But theyre with the set of grandparents which a therapist has pegged as healthy rather than toxic.", "As others have said, atm it\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s not your problem to fix. If Jill is playing silly games it\u2019s up to SIL to sort out with the support of therapist and you lot to follow SIL\u2019s lead. Not so-and-so said this-and-that.\n\nAs others have also said, two weeks with Ray and Kay not having contact is not a biggie. Worse for the kids, but again, it\u2019s two weeks.\n\nNTA \n\nLet it go. Support SIL as and when she asks you for help, as much as you can without compromising your own boundaries.", "Personally, I have my doubts about Will and Jill\u2019s emotional health as well. They raised my BIL who is still on his work trip as an example. They\u2019re certainly better than Ray and Kay, but probably not great."]}
