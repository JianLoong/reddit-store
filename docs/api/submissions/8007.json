Your daughter isn't displeased because she doesn't know any better. Birthdays are for celebrating that person.

Wait until she starts going to birthday parties in school. Somehow I don't think she'll be so happy about this tradition.", "**YTA**\n\nI'm fine with non-traditional, and I'd absolutely support an unusual family tradition if you had a clear reason for doing it. Like, I know a family that has a tradition of the birthday child spending the day getting involved in charitable works. They start very young, and the children get to help choose where they're going to volunteer and/or what charities they're going to help, and while they also get a couple of gifts for themselves, it teaches them to be less self-involved, that not everyone is as lucky or blessed as they are, and that their birthday is a wonderful occasion to SHARE some of their blessings and privilege with other people. This year, for example, the 5-year-old spent the day with her sister, mum, and grandma making up little gift bags for a family shelter that included nice things for both the women and kids. If you were doing something like that I'd be totally on board.\n\nBut what you're talking about isn't just \"non-traditional\", it's irrational, and more importantly, it feels weirdly shaming. Your kids may not currently see it that way because you've framed it as them \"doing a kindness\". But why? What's the purpose? Why do you and their other relatives *deserve* a present on their birthday, while they do not? How do you justify saying to your child, \"You were born on this day, so now you owe everyone in the family a gift?\" The very concept of it implies that *you are teaching them that they have to compensate for their existence, for being born, by remunerating the family*. It's super problematic on the face of it, unless you have some explanation that we're not seeing. Because this isn't charitable, that I can see, and there's no real lesson other than, \"On your birthday, we don't celebrate you, you need to justify your celebration to others.\" \n\nLike, this isn't even, \"Give your mum a gift of thanks\". It's gifts for everyone in the family from siblings to cousins . . . why? \n\nYTA. Just because something is a tradition doesn't make it unproblematic.

Giving gifts to other people on your birthday makes it seem as if the birthday person needs to compensate for their existence by thanking everyone for putting up with their existence.

So that everyone can celebrate together. And I always thought it was so great to pack these parcels and go shopping for them beforehand.

But again, that's not what this is. In this instance, the OP *dictates to her children to whom they must give gifts*, and it is always the same people, members of their immediate family and close cousins.
