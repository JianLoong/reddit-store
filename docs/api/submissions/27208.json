The wedding is a long ways away and so far we have a venue booked, a photographer hired, and a DJ hired. Those are about the only decisions we\u2019ve made. I haven\u2019t even fully decided how many groomsmen i\u2019m going to be having, and my fianc\u00e9e knows she wants to include three of her best friends. One as maid of honor, one as matron of honor, and one as a bridesmaid. We have not talked about what this will look like on the wedding day, and haven\u2019t nailed down too many details about the wedding parties, but we know they will not stand up with us during the ceremony. She has a brother that we would like to include, and i have two sisters (34&36) that we would like to include. We haven\u2019t talked about what that looks like. I had one of my sisters over for dinner last week and she casually in conversation asked my fianc\u00e9e who she was going to include in her wedding party. My fianc\u00e9e told her the three friends she was including and that was the end of it. Fast forward to yesterday. I get a call from that sister saying she talked it over with my parents, my other sister, and a few cousins and they all agreed that it\u2019s really messed up that my fiancee is not making them bridesmaids. I get really upset and super defensive because my fiancee and i haven\u2019t even fully talked about this yet (because the wedding is 14 months away), and i don\u2019t want my sister creating drama and basically gossiping about me to my entire family. I tell her its not her place to be talking about this with anyone because we haven\u2019t decided anything for certain and now it feels like however we include them wont feel genuine. We get in a huge fight and she tells me she doesn\u2019t want to come to the wedding. I say ok. She blocks me and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

Own goal, sis.", "NTA - weddings make some folks lose their minds and act really selfish. We wanted to elope to avoid my MIL, but, oddly enough, she was great and it was my family that ruined things. \n\nAnyway, do you really want to have a wedding without your sister there? Do you really want the drama of family division overshadowing y\u2019all\u2019s day? I mean, obviously that wasn\u2019t your goal and her ridiculousness got things this far, but why not attempt to clear the air this far out? I\u2019d just explain that you want to incorporate your family because they\u2019re important to you, but it\u2019s just too early to figure out exactly what that looks like. That you want her there and that her absence would put a damper on the day, but that it\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s wedding and you\u2019re going to decide how it\u2019s going to go. And that you got upset because it felt like she was trashing you and your fianc\u00e9e behind your backs. \n\nI\u2019m not saying apologize or promise that she be the MOH or cave to her demands, just let her know she\u2019s important to you, that you want her to attend, that y\u2019all wanted to have them involved somehow, but that you won\u2019t tolerate her dictating how your wedding will go. If she keeps acting selfishly after that, obviously, keep setting and enforcing those boundaries, but you\u2019ve tried. \n\nBest of luck as you navigate the next year of wedding planning. You\u2019re gonna need it.", "NTA BUT you\u2019re giving people something to complain about for no reason. The answer to anything wedding is \u201cwe really haven\u2019t made any final decisions yet, the wedding is still quite far off\u201d. That\u2019s the end of the story.

It's your day, invite whoever you want to spend it with in whatever capacity.", "NTA\n\nWhy is she ALREADY making your wedding about HER?\n\nAlso she can be your groomswoman.

And you could have explained (then or when she called) that family was probably involved but not planned, the bridesmaids listed were in addition to family.\n\nAlso you told your sister:\n\n>now it feels like however we include them wont feel genuine.\n\nYou are fighting drama with drama. You are both AHs. If you don't want drama then talk to your sister, apologize for blowing up. then calmly explain why you were upset that she made her assumption and that instead of asking you first she went behind your back to other family members.

Has anyone told you how lovely it can be to elope?", "NTA because your sister really escalated that. But, given you haven\u2019t made any final decisions AND you maybe did want to include them - why did your fianc\u00e9 answer that way? She did make it seem like this was the final lineup.  She should have said some variation of, we\u2019re not sure yet.  Or even \u201cFor sure A, B and C and we\u2019re still working on everything else\u201d", "NTA, the entitlement from your sister is ridiculous. Why do you want someone like that at your wedding? Does she constantly try to run your life?  Are you going to let your family ruin your wedding day by making it all about them?  You need to put your foot down, your family needs to learn their place, in the pews.", "NTA. Your sister behaved like a giant asshole. She has no business talking about your wedding with your family and making decisions for you. Tell the rest of your family that you haven\u2019t decided anything yet, and that anyone who thinks they can bully their way into a certain position at the wedding, will not be invited.", "NTA. Wow, so your sister just grabbed a spoon and started stirring shit? Oh, well. She uninvited herself and blocked you, so you don't have to listen to that for a while. If anyone else asks, tell them the truth - you haven't even thought that far yet and nothing has been decided. You'll let them know when there is something to tell them. Until then, you just want people to be cool and not stress out over the details. You and your fiance will ask for help if you need it.", "Wow.  Am I out of touch with reality, or does this feel like a massive over-reaction? (the sister).  Traditionally, at least in the part of the country where I'm from, female family members of the groom are generally NOT included on the bride's side of the wedding party.  So, from my perspective, sister is acting INCREDIBLY entitled.  \n\nNTA - your wedding, your choice.  Is there more going on here than just this?  It seems very odd that both of your sisters + x # of cousins would expect to be bridesmaids.", "She asked about the fianc\u00e9s bridesmaids, duh. So the fianc\u00e9 just told her who she was thinking of, perhaps not very smart since there was no formal decision. I\u2019m guessing the brother was thinking of making his sisters groomswomen, or something like that.", "Actually she asked about the wedding party.  And it\u2019s not clear if he was thinking of making them grooms women or something else.  OP also mentions including the brides brother in some way.\n\nAgreed that it wasn\u2019t smart to answer so definitively if nothing is actually decided."]}
