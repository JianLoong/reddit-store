Please don\u2019t let him coerce or manipulate you into babysitting while you\u2019re on vacation.", "NTA\ncouple = 2 people. That's all it means. I'd ask why they said couple when they now mean family- you're going to be spending your time and money and were misled.", "NTA but this sounds like you and your wife could use a little couples time, so why do you want to bring other ppl on the trip anyway? You already have a babysitter, cancel the friends trip and book a trip with just your wife. Having another couple on the trip who will expect you to babysit since \"they need couple time too\" will not give you and wife the break you need.\n\nIf you are worried about being an asshole for cancelling the trip, just be honest. Tell them you assumed a childfree weekend to have a break and you are not willing to spend this money on a trip with baby.", "NTA - your friend is an idiot and doesn't know what a \"couples trip\" is. Anyway, no loss. You leave your kid with grandma and have plenty of hotel room sex. Make sure you thank your friend for the \"couples trip\" and tell them how much you banged the entire time.", "NTA. I hope they don\u2019t plan to dump their baby on your heads while they go enjoy themselves. I think they did not want your child around. Better to cancel saying you misunderstood. Go somewhere else.", "I think the three year old would take a lot of attention but I\u2019ve known 9 month old babies who don\u2019t. Some of them are quite chill and portable.\n\nI think this trip could possibly work out fine.", "Agreed. There\u2019s no way this trip will end well with them bringing their baby. They are going to ask op and his wife to watch the baby so they can get alone time. If op says no, they are going to be mad because they are jealous they have responsibilities rather than free time. While op gets to sit pretty and enjoy a break. If op says yes, he could\u2019ve just stayed home and watched his own kid for free (no plane/hotel/trip costs). Just cancel with them and op and his wife go alone. This is screaming for an update saying they aren\u2019t friends anymore. Unless this hotel has free childcare, it\u2019s not happening.", "Just be prepared to dig your heels in and refuse to be free babysitting or take the baby anywhere that would be inappropriate to have a baby.", "No offense, but you will have limited opportunities to have vacations alone as your child grows older. Don't waste one because of someone else's poor choices. You would not be the asshole, and it is a pretty basic choice of self-respect to at least attempt to get the vacation you want.", "Could you and the other couple split the cost of a babysitter to travel the length of the trip?", "Agree with you, I have found trips with my son to be easier when he was below one year old. I don\u2019t blame OP and his wife for wanting a weekend break once in a while.\n\nThis trip would be fine. There will just be times when the other couple might not be able to hang out, like feeding times, nap times and going to bed earlier. But I am sure OP will be able to have a great time regardless.", "You can have a couple's retreat and still take your kid on vacation. Many resorts have child care facilities."]}
