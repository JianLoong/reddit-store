She usually makes really great food, but once in a while she makes it the way she likes it, while knowing I don't like it, and I think that is fair, as long as it's not too often, which it isn't.

She looks AWFUL. But she looks happy. She asks you what you think of her new hairdo.\n\nIn this situation, would you say \"I absolutely hate it\" since that is the truth?
