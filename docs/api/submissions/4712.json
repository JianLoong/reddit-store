I had agreed but I didn't know it was this weekend. I always spend the weekends with my mom (50F) she works from home and is pretty lonely since my dad (52M) lives away due to work. So, I try my best to spend time with my mom and I also love spending time with her since we get along very well and she is my favourite person.\n\nSo when my gf told me it was this weekend I called my mom and asked her if she had any plans. I told my mom I had to go with my gf. But my mom told me that, she wanted me to take her out for dinner this weekend. And besides, it's my gf's work place party so it's none of my business, and she didn't wanna be alone on the weekend.\n\nI agreed with her as I don't know anyone at my girlfriend's workplace so it would be pretty awkward. And, I would love to spend time with my mom and didn't want her to feel lonely.\n\nSo when I told my gf that I couldn't attend the party, she got mad at me and asked me, why I always put my mom first it's almost like I am married to my mom. I told her I obviously will put my mom first until we get married and, I just didn't want my mom to be lonely. And then she started arguing about why we don't get married and stuff like that.\n\nMy gf isn't speaking to me after that, but I just don't see what I did wrong here. I just didn't want my mom to be lonely, plus I don't regret spending the weekend with my mom.

Also, spending every single weekend with your mom is creepy.  Your gf is right - just marry your mom.  You will always put her above anyone and will ruin all of your relationships because of it.  It is not your responsibility to make sure your mom isn't lonely - she's an adult and can take care of herself.  Don't be surprised when gf leaves you over this.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is right. You agreed to go to the party with her, then blew her off for your mommy.\n\nIt's not just your girlfriend who feels this way, dude. Literally every woman you date is going to have major issues with this setup. If your dad works out of town, you spending literally every weekend with mommy is not a reasonable or healthy solution.\n\n>I told my mom I had to go with my gf. But my mom told me that, she wanted me to take her out for dinner this weekend. And besides, it's my gf's work place party so it's none of my business, and she didn't wanna be alone on the weekend.\n\n\\^Your mom sounds incredibly manipulative, and you sound like you want to be married to your mom. \"I *have* to go to this bbq with my gf.\" Spending time with your girlfriend shouldn't be an obligation. It should be a joy. And if you'd literally always rather be with your mom, then you have no business dating anyone right now.", "YTA, when you agreed to go to the bbq party, when did you think it was going to happen? On a thursday at 7 AM?", "Your ex girlfriend. Fixed that for you. YTA.", "So, to sum up:\n\n* You ***always*** spend the weekends with your mom.\n* Your girlfriend asked for ***one party*** (one day, a few hours) to support her and you said yes.\n* Your mom not only puts down your girlfriend, but has nothing scheduled or meaningful that needs to be done both days. And taking her out to dinner could be either day and wouldn't impact things.\n* You decided you didn't know anyone at the party so it would be awkward, forgetting that ***you know your girlfriend*** and she wants to ***introduce you to people who are important to her***, in both directions (you to them, them to you).\n* Your girlfriend called it right that you are already married to your mom.\n\nYTA, your mom needs to cut the umbilical cord and you need to realize that if you ever want to have a relationship with someone you will need to get your head out of your ass long enough to value their needs as much as your own, or (god help us all), *your mother*. Ugh.", "YTA and not for the reason you necessarily think you might be. From my vantage point of being 75 years old \u2014 your mother at 50 is too damned young to isolate herself so much that her 22 year old son is her social life. You\u2019re enabling her.  Then you turn around and claim you\u2019ll not spend every weekend with her once you get married. You\u2019re really the AH if you think that is going to fly. You\u2019re also an AH because it looks like you *used* your mom suddenly wanting to be taken out to dinner as an excuse to avoid a bbq you don\u2019t want to to attend.", "YTA, \n\nwhy do you even have a GF if you want to spend all your time with your mom? \n\n>I told my mom I had to go with my gf.

Pretty typical \"momma's boy\" behaviour.\n\nYour mom will live if you miss hanging out with her for a few hours. \n\nYou're important to your girlfriend and presumably work is important to your girlfriend. Your girlfriend was hoping she could bring you to meet her coworkers.\n\nThink about if she had to verbatim explain to her coworkers why you're not coming EXACTLY as you wrote it. \n\n\"Yeah Jake isn't coming because he wants to hang out with his mom and he told me he doesn't know any of you so it would be awkward\".\n\nBeing in a relationship means you're going to have to meet new people eventually. Being in a relationship also means that you're going to have to put your partner first sometimes.", "YTA simply because you spend every weekend with your mum over your partner. Also you didn't actually have any plans with your mum when your gf asked you, you made the dinner plans with your mum AFTER you said yes to your gf...\n\nETA: could you not just go to your gfs bbq one day and dinner with your mum the other day?", "YTA\n\n\"I told her I obviously will put my mom first until we get married and, I just didn't want my mom to be lonely.\"\n\nDo everyone a favor and break up with your ~~girlfriend~~ friend with benefits.

Concerts or other shows on the weekends?\n\nYou aren't mature enough for a relationship.", "YTA.  Your mom is a grown woman.  The fact she\u2019s gotten it into her head she\u2019s so entitled to your time that she can cancel plans you\u2019ve already made and agreed to with other people means you need to be doing *more* to encourage her to seek out her own friends and hobbies instead of just leaning on you, not less.  \n\nApologize to your girlfriend, assuming she even still *is* your girlfriend.  And if you *have* messed this up beyond fixing, get to therapy to figure out how to set healthy limits with your mom if you ever *do* want to have another committed romantic relationship.", "At this rate you\u2019ll be spending all weekends with your mum because you\u2019re unlikely to ever get married. Unless it\u2019s a long distance relationship. YTA", "Sounds like you have ditched your gf often, \"because you **must** spend every weekend with mom\".\n\nIts totally cool and lovely to spend time with Mother, but you just cant cancel all plans made with gf, just because they are on the weekend which you always spend with your mom.\n\nYTA Mamas boi", "YTA. Just go home to mommy. I hope your ex girlfriend finds a man not tied to mommy's apron strings.", "YTA, do your gf a favor and dump her, you're not ready for a relationship", "YTA - why are you cancelling plans you already made with your gf to meet with your mother who you see every weekend", "YTA and so is your mom. It\u2019s great to have a close relationship with your mom, but not to the detriment of starting your own life.\n\nHad you been my son, I would have never wanted you to spend your night with me vs being with your (probably soon to be ex) gf at her Christmas party", "YTA.  You made a commitment to your gf, and now you want to back out of it because it isn't convenient?\n\nI'm sure your mom can handle one weekend day by herself.  You're seeing her every weekend, and your gf is only asking for one day for an event that is important to her.  The fact that you don't know her work colleagues is irrelevant - you'd be going for her, not her coworkers.", "YTA and guess what. Your mom, who is your best friend and the person who you are putting first in your life is also gaslighting you, manipulating you and guilt tripping you into spending time with her. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s lonely, but she could also do something for herself to occupy her time.  \n\nBut you seem happy and your mom seemed fine with all of this, so do your girlfriend a favor and make her an ex girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nYou agreed to go to the party, then made more plans with your mother on top of them, knowing you wouldn't be able to go to what you'd already agreed to.\n\nYou are not responsible for your mother's happiness - this doesn't mean you can't make her happy btw, just that SHE is responsible for sorting herself out, and it's unfair of her to make you, her adult son, responsible for that.\n\nAlso, if you keep this behaviour up you'll never make it to marriage with anyone.", "Yeah, YTA. You already agreed to the plans with your gf and you spend EVERY weekend with your mom. You can spend one weekend with your girlfriend. Your mom can survive being alone one weekend, or maybe she could go out with friends if she absolutely can\u2019t be alone.\n\nEither way, if you\u2019re constantly choosing your mom over your gf now, you\u2019re not gonna stop just because you get married. You\u2019ve already set the precedent and your mom knows that you\u2019ll always choose her.", "YTA, didn't you already tell your gf that you were going to go to the party with her? Your mom seems weirdly attached to you; she can't even be alone for one night while you're at the party. Why do you HAVE to visit your mom? She's a grown ass woman with no friends and no hobbies to keep her busy for ONE NIGHT.", "YTA. Don't date mama's boys ladies and gentlemen. Just don't do it.", "YTA You committed going to this function with your gf and chose your mom over your gf. Most people work weekdays and have weekends off which means most likely on your time off, you're choosing your mom over her. I can see why she isn't talking with you. You're making it very clear where she stands in your life. Bottom of the totem pole.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't regret ditching your gf here maybe you aren't ready for a relationship. Your mom needs to realize shes interfering with your growth as a person here and you're letting her.", "YTA- Let me get this right..you spend EVERY weekend with your mom??? Wow, how do you even have a girlfriend? Nothing wrong with loving your mom and spending time with her, but you said you would go, then backed out. Your mom can't do all things for you that your woman does, that's why you need a healthy balance. Your mom has your dad. You are gonna be alone if you don't start cutting that cord.", "YTA for essentially dating your mom at this point. How do you ever expect to get married when you prioritize your mom over your girlfriend? It\u2019s nice that you care about your mom so much, but you are not responsible for her feelings of loneliness. If she\u2019s having a hard time with her husband being away, that sucks but that\u2019s her problem to solve. You spending every single weekend at her beck and call, and allowing her to guilt you into running to her side whenever she wants, is not the answer. \n\nYou will never be married if you let things continue like this. Brace yourself for your girlfriend to break up with you. You as good as told her you will always put your mom first even after you\u2019re married. Because why would she trust what you say when your actions prove otherwise?", "YTA and your mother plays you like a fiddle. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with enjoying seeing your mother. There's something wrong with refusing to do anything else every single weekend. No matter what you're supposed to be doing, she'll have plans that weekend and reasons you should see her instead. \n\nKeep it up and you're never getting married, dude.", "YTA. Seems like you should marry your mommy", "Might have understood if it was your moms 70s birthday \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut \u201ei thought you took me out for dinner\u201c?!\nOver your gf?\nAnd you even believe it would change with marriage?\nMarriage is a paper, and some laws behind it, who and how you are now won\u2019t change most likely. And why would you marry your gf? I see someone else waiting in line already.", "Nobody is going to want to marry you if you always put your mom first. You won\u2019t magically change course just because you signed a piece of paper. It\u2019s nice that you get along with your mom, but you aren\u2019t her built in entertainment.", "YTA and I advise your girlfriend to move on and for you to stop dating her.  If you want to be \"married\" (your words) to your Mom, you shouldn't be dating others.  You will not magically stop putting your Mom first when you get married.", "YTA, and your girlfriend should leave this relationship. I think that the biggest green flag in men is being caring and attentive to their mothers, but that's not what this is. It would be something if your mom had a birthday or something planned for a long time, but you can have dinner with her anytime. If you ever plan on marrying, you need to understand that the family you are forming needs to be your complete priority, and you are showing to your gf that they won't. Being close to your mom is amazing, but you also need space to grow as an adult. ALL WEEKENDS ARE YOUR MOM's? that's just excessive.", "YTA. God, you are mama\u2019s boy.", "There are two days in the weekend. I doubt your gf\u2019s work party would last an entire day, much less two entire days. You could have compromised & gone to your gf\u2019s work party AND spent a day w/your mom. Either way, time to cut those apron strings otherwise you\u2019re never getting married to ANYONE. YTA.", "YTA and you need to grow up.", "YTA. \nShe\u2019s not going to wait to marry you (or want to marry you) if she doesn\u2019t feel like your priority.  Also your Mom is an AH too for guilting you and manipulating you that way.  It\u2019s BS and unfair to your GF.  Of course you should be part of her life and that includes her work.  Most people are here upset when their SO doesn\u2019t want them to attend work functions with them.   You can still see your mom but this reads like every minute of every weekend is dedicated to her and you can\u2019t keep a GF with that lifestyle.", "YTA\n\nSo you spend all your weekends with your mom??? What about if you have family? Although by the looks of it you wont have one because no girl wants to be with a guy who's already married to his mom. Which by the sounds of it your mom want mind.", "YTA for having a girlfriend when you are clearly already in a relationship with your mother.", "Does your mother have no friends? The OP makes it sound like you are her only relief from loneliness.\n\nand I pair this with your comment that \"I don't know anyone at my girlfriend's workplace so it would be pretty awkward.\" Talking and eating company bbq with strangers is awkward? The whole event is a mingle and meet people you don't know thing, that's why the company invited employee partners.\n\nIt sounds like your raising was to not be comfortable around strangers. (Which seems to match your mom's difficulty in making friends.)\n\nBut to the judgment.\n\nI have to go with YTA. You said yes to the BBQ. When you found out the actual date of the event, its not clear if you told gf yes and then called your mom. Or if you called your mommy for permission before saying a final yes to your gf. But either situation makes you TA.\n\n\"I obviously will put my mom first until we get married.\" Sounds like your mom is going to run your life until you are married. When you will switch to your (then) wife. Your gf should be aware that you are never going to be the leader in your life. You are going to be switching from birth mommy to wife mommy.\n\nA couple of suggestions. One, mom can be made un-lonley on weekdays as well as weekends. And, some weekend if you and your gf were to take mom out to dinner it would be a nice thing.", "YTA. She's your GF, you're going to need to get used to prioritising her or don't have a GF at all. You ARE choosing your mum over her and your mum knows EXACTLY what she's doing. She deliberately got you to choose her.", "Yta - it\u2019s nice you want to be there for your mom but you are in a relationship too and you said you would go to this bbq.", "Ok, I want to say this first. It seems that your mom does not like your GF. If she did GF would accompany you while you visit. It is very unhealthy for you and your mother to rely on each other this much. A visit is a day! Not a weekend! If you plan on keeping a GF then you need to get your life straight. This is not straight. You are 22 and this is not good!!! \n\nYTA - for making plans and then canceling them because your mommy told you to! You are the AH because you put your mommy before everything!!! If mommy said I need you to move in because I am lonely then I can only guess you would be packing your bag!!!", "YTA. Your mom is manipulating you. It\u2019s not your job to be her emotional crutch. You have your own life to live. Plus, you made the commitment and it\u2019s not an emergency. No woman is going to accept coming second to your mom for too long. You might want to learn to set and enforce some boundaries", "Yta. Also, pretty sure your mum would have gone to work parties with your Dad. She just wants to make sure you are well and truly under her thumb. Your poor gf. She has a mamma's boy for a bf.", "YTA,   \n\n\n  \nShe is right, you are married to your mom.", "YTA and dude, you ain't ever getting married if you keep at it... neither this gf, or any other sane woman would marry a guy like you described yourself in this post.", "YTA. You are not your mother's replacement husband. Your mom is not an elderly invalid. She should be getting out in the world, not sabotaging her son's life. Your mother COMPLETELY manipulated you.\n\nYour GF deserves better.", "YTA. \n\nSo you are happy to go to a BBQ and meet your girlfriend's coworkers until your mom tells you that you don't need to involve yourself with them, and then suddenly you can't imagine why you would meet them?\n\nYou have plans but then your mother must see you at the exact time of the plans, and you can't fathom that...there are other times to see your mother?\n\nI hope your girlfriend can feel this post- run girl, run!\n\nMy partner just came to my work event, to support ME. And to get to know the people I work with, because if you never meet people, you never know them- do you understand how that works?\n\nYour girlfriend invited you to an event, so it is your \"business\" and she wants to include you in her life, which is common in relationships. You let your mother decide that you didn't need to bother showing up for something your girlfriend told you was important to her- she asked you to come- and there are multiple days and times in the weekend, so how could you not do both?\n\nJust move in with your mom and live happily ever after, let this girl go find an actual man to be with.", "YTA and a mommas boy. Good luck finding a partner who will put up with your bs lol", "YTA - you can hang out with your mom during the day and take her to lunch at whatever restaurant she wanted to go to for dinner. Then you can go to your gf\u2019s work party. It\u2019s nice that your close to your mom. My son is 16 and I do hope that he\u2019ll still enjoy time together with me even when he\u2019s an adult. But I would never want him to spend every weekend with me because I love him and I want him to live his life and have experiences beyond just spending time with me. Balance is so important in life. It would be good for your mom to find the balance in her life too. I spend a good amount of time with my mom but the whole family is included in that. My husband and kids are also there as well as my sisters and their family. We see my mom 3-5 times a week for lunch on weekends or dinner on weekdays. But we wouldn\u2019t ditch our spouses or other important events just to hang out with our mom and neither would our mom expect us to.", "YTA. You are you mother's emotional husband. You will not stop doing what your mom asks when you marry because you can't stand up for yourself or your girlfriend. \n\nYour girlfriend only has a a boyfriend on weekdays. Do you know how it sounds? Like you have two girlfriends: one on the weekdays and one on the weekends.", "YTA. I hope for your gf happiness that she doesn't marry you. This emotional incest is getting out of hand, try some therapy.", "I have so many questions... when did you think the party was going to be?\n\nIf weekends with your mother are that important why would you agree to go to the party without confirming the time and date first?\n\nThere's 48 hours in a weekend, some people might say there's even more if you count from clock out on Friday to clock in on Sunday, do you really have to spend every second with your mother?\n\nAre you okay with being single for the rest of your life? Because not many women are going to put up with being second place. And I know you said you'd put your gf first once you're married but if I were dating you I wouldn't trust that to be true, and even if it was I wouldn't trust your mom not to fight it and make my life miserable in retribution.\n\nLast but not least, and this isn't a question, you should look into emotional incest because that's exactly what's happening here.", "Significant others go to workplace parties. It is a thing you do.", "she's going to break up with you and you deserve it. you can go ahead and date your mom now", "YTA; \n\nYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t know her coworkers and I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been awkward, but maybe she wanted you to meet them and have you be a part of something in her world. Using that as an excuse was you trying to justify your reasoning. She didn\u2019t have to invite you, but she did. Her response could\u2019ve been a bit better but it\u2019s her feelings were probably hurt. \n\nYour mother sees you every weekend, but there are 2 days in a weekend, so why couldn\u2019t she just reschedule it for whatever day your GF\u2019s party wasn\u2019t on?", "YTA", "YTA.

I\u2019m sorry, this is gonna be hard to hear, but: it\u2019s not your job to entertain your mom every single weekend. Yes, it sucks for her that your dad is away so much, but she\u2019s a grown woman and is perfectly capable of finding friends or a hobby that will keep her busy. You\u2019re 22, you\u2019re supposed to be living your life!

I get that living alone most of the time and working from home can be lonely. But, it isn't normal to not allow someone to have a social life of their own because you don't know what to do with yourself. She can still go out to dinner. She can bring a book or something. Or if it's a place with bar seating, she could interact with people there.", "YTA, your mum already has a husband. She is selfishly interfering with your growth and independence.

When you get into a serious relationship that person becomes priority.  You couldn't give up one weekend to go to an event with your gf that you said yes to? That right there shows gf where she stands in your life and what life would be like if you married because now it's oh we aren't married but I doubt it'll change once you are.  \n\nAlso your mom is an AH too. The type of relationship you have with your mom is actually a thing and really unhealthy.  Your mother has basically made you her substitute husband.  She should not be asking you to  skip a weekend with your gf to take her out on a date (because that's basically what it was).  You need to cut the cord if you're going to have any meaningful relationship where your partner is happy.\n\nMaybe read some posts in the JNMIL threads here on reddit.

I had agreed but I didn't know it was this weekend. I always spend the weekends with my mom (50F) she works from home and is pretty lonely since my dad (52M) lives away due to work. So, I try my best to spend time with my mom and I also love spending time with her since we get along very well and she is my favourite person.\n\nSo when my gf told me it was this weekend I called my mom and asked her if she had any plans. I told my mom I had to go with my gf. But my mom told me that, she wanted me to take her out for dinner this weekend. And besides, it's my gf's work place party so it's none of my business, and she didn't wanna be alone on the weekend.\n\nI agreed with her as I don't know anyone at my girlfriend's workplace so it would be pretty awkward. And, I would love to spend time with my mom and didn't want her to feel lonely.\n\nSo when I told my gf that I couldn't attend the party, she got mad at me and asked me, why I always put my mom first it's almost like I am married to my mom. I told her I obviously will put my mom first until we get married and, I just didn't want my mom to be lonely. And then she started arguing about why we don't get married and stuff like that.\n\nMy gf isn't speaking to me after that, but I just don't see what I did wrong here. I just didn't want my mom to be lonely, plus I don't regret spending the weekend with my mom. So, AITA reddit?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
