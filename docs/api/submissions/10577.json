Sounds like they\u2019re pretty awful tbh. \n\nBut as a reality check for you, thinking you need to get married at 25 because you had \u201cmultiple failed relationships\u201d by age 22\u2026that\u2019s not a great motivation. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you\u2019re young and were incredibly young during those prior relationships - they likely weren\u2019t as serious as you think, compared to other things you\u2019ll experience in life. \n\nGood luck with this. It sounds like a tough one", "NTA & \u201cyou better propose to me before my grandmother dies\u201d feels kind of\u2026 manipulative? Especially the reactions afterwards, the entire family is SO passive aggressive that you haven\u2019t proposed yet - that\u2019s a red flag right there. You\u2019re allowed to wait until YOU feel secure, if she has a problem and they all act like that idk if I\u2019d even tie myself to them because wtf", "NTA, and although it may be unpleasant, you may have just discovered a nasty trait in her and her family that could cause you misery for years to come. Sounds like they expect you to be a mind-reader and to adjust yourself to fit their perspectives.", "NTA, and do you really want to marry into an apparently AH family?", "NTA. Your entire future takes priority over some half-dead person's bucket list. No offense to half-dead people.", "NTA\n\nIf it was such a big deal why didn't she propose to you?  I mean it is 2023.", "NTA\n\nGrief or not, that was a really bad way to approach that with you. Honestly, I think waiting paid off. Now you\u2019re getting to see a side that you had not seen before. Do you really want to marry someone and have in laws that are going to act like that? I\u2019m sorry for their loss. I\u2019m sure grandma would have loved to see her granddaughter get married. You can\u2019t rush that or try to pressure someone for that. \n\nI would take some time to really think this through. I have a feeling this won\u2019t be the last time you hear about it from any of them. Again, I do understand that they are grieving, but this is not something to guilt someone about. I wouldn\u2019t want to be married to and deal with in laws that didn\u2019t stand up for me or guilted me every time I didn\u2019t do what they wanted when they wanted. Good luck", "NTA - Gotta love folks who criticize you for not meeting unspoken timelines until it\u2019s too late. /s It was definitely inappropriate for your gf\u2019s family to have any opinion on your proposal timeline whatsoever. And if this was something that was really important to your gf, she should have spoken up about it. The fact that she didn\u2019t suggests that she didn\u2019t think about it until her family said something\u2026again\u2026after the fact.", "NTA.  You had your timeline of things you wanted to accomplish, and your actions demonstrate alot of maturity.  Grief-stricken or not, her family is crossing boundaries & girlfriend should have had your back.  Life has no guarantees, and there may be other friends/family members that may get very ill/die before you propose and/or get engaged.  Does that mean you need to propose tonight?  NO.  You need to take some time to think, and ask your girlfriend if she wants to marry you.  If she can't move forward without whining about her grandmother, rethink the relationship.  You are mature, and a true catch.  Believe this.", "You sound very sensible OP. NTA.\n\n 2.5 years is not \"dragging your feet\". I'm sorry her grandmother didn't live to see her granddaughter get married but \"which family member might die?\" is a difficult burden to put on an expected marriage. \n\nAlso if my grandchild got hitched at 25, I would HAUNT her ass. Far too young.", "NTA. No one else should have a say in when to marry except the marrying couple.\n\nIf they wanted you to pop the question earlier while everyone knew grandma was sick, this conversation should have been had earlier. And you\u2019re still not obligated to make your decision on their wants. Your and their expectations would have been better communicated.", "NTA in my opinion, it's not your fault when you choose to propose to her or not.\nIt's sad that your gfs grandma died before she could've seen her get married but you didn't need to if you didn't want to do it before the 3 year mark.", "Unless you're leaving out that *she* proposed to *you* while her grandmother was alive, and you *turned her down* \\-- I cannot understand any of this is your fault? NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had already made plans on when you\u2019ll propose. I\u2019m pretty sure if she wanted you to propose earlier she would of mentioned something about it, unless she did but that isn\u2019t given at the moment. \n\nHonestly she should of been supportive of you when that happened.", "NTA. Never let anyone pressure you when it comes to big life decisions. You take your time and make sure you feel it\u2019s the right moment. Today it\u2019s grandma dying. Tomorrow will be whatever. If you let them stream roll you like that, you\u2019ll be a doormat. Stand your ground.", "NTA - that's a ridiculous expectation.  And even if you had proposed, what?  You're supposed to get married the next week just to make the dying grandmother happy?  That's some bullshit right there.  \n\nHonestly, I'd take a look at this relationship.  The 3-year thing is cute, and I see why you'd want to wait, but even without that plan, you have VERY VALID reasons for needing to wait to purchase a ring.  Don't let them guilt you or strong-arm you into doing something you're not comfortable with or ready for.", "NTA; if that was so important to her she should have explicitly said so. You could also ask why she didn\u2019t work to save up for a ring and propose to you if this timeline was so paramount", "NTA but after she deals with her grief, decide if you still want to propose.", "If you\u2019d proposed early enough granny could\u2019ve got to see her married and divorced!  NTA", "don't propose", "NTA. She should have supported you.", "NTA. Her family is rude and bonkers.", "NTA. The remark was mean spirited and intrusive. She didn\u2019t have your back! Again, She don\u2019t have your back!!", "NTA your girlfriend's family is out of line and she is being rude. So you would have had to get engaged a year plus ago for the wedding to be able to happen before grandma was too sick to attend. That is a crazy stick to measure when to get engaged by. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY are all AHs. And your gf is an AH. Are you sure want to marry THAT person?", "NAH Op your not a asshole for not proposing you might not be ready and that's ok, but your girlfriend and her family are grieving not your fault but that's how your girlfriend feels about the situation right now. That doesn't mean she will forever it seems that the death is fresh be there for your girlfriend right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she wanted to get married so bad she should have proposed to you.", "NTA\n\nThis is not a good reason to rush a proposal. Her family is completely out of line", "NTA - and you need to take this new information in consideration as well and you would be NTA if this event makes you decide not to propose to your GF yet.\n\nYou are NTA for wanting to wait and be sure this relationship is the one especially since you have a history of failed relationships.  Likewise you are not NTA for wanting to be on a stable financial basis before proposing.  Likewise, while they are talking about your proposal it also sounds like they would have demanded that you rush the wedding as well.\n\nSo you have a couple of serious issues to consider now.  Granted your GF's family is in mourning and struggling to accept Grandmother's death, but their behaviour is still unacceptable, and your GF's behaviour is worse.  You need to be a team with your partner and be able to trust your partner will not only have your back but talk to you when there are problems.\n\nSo before agreeing to marry you need to agree on boundaries with yours and her families and  get a sensible and sane communication plan between the two of you.   I  suggest premarital counselling is something to consider as well.", "Nta if she wanted to get married so bad she could have proposed herself", "NTA , but do you really want to be in a relationship with someone so emotionally vindictive. Expect her to guilt you on a lot more of your 100% sound choices. Honestly kind of gross. I would request an apology from at least her, if not the family (considering they made it their business), before thinking about proposing.", "NTA. You're doing things the mature way by making sure you are actually prepared, meanwhile they wanted the optics. Her family was incredibly rude and passive aggressive to you. People get married much too quickly and you're doing the right thing by waiting.", "NTA but I do think that grief makes people do and say strange things. In the past year I have lost my mom, best friend, another friend and my dog. All due to either age or cancer. I find myself saying the most bizarre things, like my brain filter is gone. I would go ahead with your plan, as being engaged is not being married.  There is a reason you made the plan to spend the rest of your life with her before, just keep in mind what it was.", "NTA. I\u2019d be weary of proposing after that.\nThere is way more to marriage than a goal to check off a bucket list as fast as you can.

Which will sounds like a marriage that either won\u2019t last or won\u2019t be a happy one", "NTA\n\nSomeone dying is no reason to propose, get married in a quickie ceremony or to get pregnant so Nana can meet her grandchild.\n\nIn other advice I can share, my Nana also told me not to divorce if you\u2019re not the one that is ill cause you\u2019ll kick yourself when you don\u2019t get to inherit the estate.\n\nDidn\u2019t quite understand the logic back when I was a kid but maybe, I can appreciate the sentiment and the cents of it!!", "YTA\n\nYou are planning on asking her.  It sounds like you had both discussed it.  Your objections don\u2019t appear to be based on not being ready to be married or unsure about anything.\n\nIt sounds like your proposal time was purely based on the timing for a nice ring.  \n\nSo you not at all considering her family situation for the timing of your proposal is a bit inconsiderate.  However if your girlfriend was the one who was insistent on needing a fancy ring then you are not the asshole as she set her own timeline", "I think OP meant that his \"several failed relationships\" are why he wanted to wait at least 3 years before proposing, to make sure the relationship he was in was the right one before committing to it for life.", "She/they didn't just want a proposal. They expected Gma to see her get married.. Idk, this seems like a red flag to me. I would never say that to a couple 2 years in.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I have heard of baby trapping earlier, this Grandma-death-trapping is next level.", "I feel personally attacked \ud83d\ude1d", "THIS. She had just as much ability to propose as you did.", "It\u2019s a stupid thing to had but I figured by year 3 I\u2019d be in a better position and could do that without financially impacting myself.

I even went ring shopping the other week but now I\u2019m kind of like wow I didn\u2019t see this side of them.", "Yeah that\u2019s true, and she probably expected to see a full blown wedding which can take months to plan and prepare\u2026 doubt she wanted to witness them just sign a paper. They definitely wanted/expected OP to propose way before and were waiting for an excuse to make comments, the comments about taking too long came up almost immediately. I would not marry her ngl it sounds like they\u2019ve been talking about OP behind their back about it for a while \ud83d\ude2d", "Your proposal, your choice of timing.  Then and now.", "info: did you know you wanted to marry her before the three-year mark? If so, how long before? Did you wait until three years just so you could say you met that criterion?", "It's a good thing that you did see this side of them then. When someone shows you who they are in stressful or emotionally charged situations, pay attention to it.", "It's not just his life, and it may be his choice but his choice can still be shit.\n\nPlanning a proposal regardless of anything about your relationship or potential bride is just about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's a great plan for when you're going to buy a house, not marry a person.\n\nHis girlfriend shouldn't be irrelevant to his plans other than as the object of them. Have they even *talked* about marriage?"]}
