Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you\u2019re young and were incredibly young during those prior relationships - they likely weren\u2019t as serious as you think, compared to other things you\u2019ll experience in life. \n\nGood luck with this. It sounds like a tough one", "NTA & \u201cyou better propose to me before my grandmother dies\u201d feels kind of\u2026 manipulative? Especially the reactions afterwards, the entire family is SO passive aggressive that you haven\u2019t proposed yet - that\u2019s a red flag right there. You\u2019re allowed to wait until YOU feel secure, if she has a problem and they all act like that idk if I\u2019d even tie myself to them because wtf", "NTA, and although it may be unpleasant, you may have just discovered a nasty trait in her and her family that could cause you misery for years to come. Sounds like they expect you to be a mind-reader and to adjust yourself to fit their perspectives.", "NTA, and do you really want to marry into an apparently AH family?", "NTA. Your entire future takes priority over some half-dead person's bucket list. No offense to half-dead people.", "NTA\n\nIf it was such a big deal why didn't she propose to you?  I mean it is 2023.", "NTA\n\nGrief or not, that was a really bad way to approach that with you. Honestly, I think waiting paid off. Now you\u2019re getting to see a side that you had not seen before. Do you really want to marry someone and have in laws that are going to act like that? I\u2019m sorry for their loss. I\u2019m sure grandma would have loved to see her granddaughter get married. You can\u2019t rush that or try to pressure someone for that. \n\nI would take some time to really think this through. I have a feeling this won\u2019t be the last time you hear about it from any of them. Again, I do understand that they are grieving, but this is not something to guilt someone about. I wouldn\u2019t want to be married to and deal with in laws that didn\u2019t stand up for me or guilted me every time I didn\u2019t do what they wanted when they wanted. Good luck", "NTA - Gotta love folks who criticize you for not meeting unspoken timelines until it\u2019s too late. /s It was definitely inappropriate for your gf\u2019s family to have any opinion on your proposal timeline whatsoever. And if this was something that was really important to your gf, she should have spoken up about it. The fact that she didn\u2019t suggests that she didn\u2019t think about it until her family said something\u2026again\u2026after the fact.", "NTA.  You had your timeline of things you wanted to accomplish, and your actions demonstrate alot of maturity.  Grief-stricken or not, her family is crossing boundaries & girlfriend should have had your back.  Life has no guarantees, and there may be other friends/family members that may get very ill/die before you propose and/or get engaged.  Does that mean you need to propose tonight?  NO.  You need to take some time to think, and ask your girlfriend if she wants to marry you.  If she can't move forward without whining about her grandmother, rethink the relationship.  You are mature, and a true catch.  Believe this.", "You sound very sensible OP. NTA.\n\n 2.5 years is not \"dragging your feet\". I'm sorry her grandmother didn't live to see her granddaughter get married but \"which family member might die?\" is a difficult burden to put on an expected marriage. \n\nAlso if my grandchild got hitched at 25, I would HAUNT her ass. Far too young.", "NTA. No one else should have a say in when to marry except the marrying couple.\n\nIf they wanted you to pop the question earlier while everyone knew grandma was sick, this conversation should have been had earlier. And you\u2019re still not obligated to make your decision on their wants. Your and their expectations would have been better communicated.", "NTA in my opinion, it's not your fault when you choose to propose to her or not.\nIt's sad that your gfs grandma died before she could've seen her get married but you didn't need to if you didn't want to do it before the 3 year mark.", "Unless you're leaving out that *she* proposed to *you* while her grandmother was alive, and you *turned her down* \\-- I cannot understand any of this is your fault? NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had already made plans on when you\u2019ll propose. I\u2019m pretty sure if she wanted you to propose earlier she would of mentioned something about it, unless she did but that isn\u2019t given at the moment. \n\nHonestly she should of been supportive of you when that happened.", "NTA. Never let anyone pressure you when it comes to big life decisions. You take your time and make sure you feel it\u2019s the right moment. Today it\u2019s grandma dying. Tomorrow will be whatever. If you let them stream roll you like that, you\u2019ll be a doormat. Stand your ground.", "NTA - that's a ridiculous expectation.  And even if you had proposed, what?  You're supposed to get married the next week just to make the dying grandmother happy?  That's some bullshit right there.  \n\nHonestly, I'd take a look at this relationship.  The 3-year thing is cute, and I see why you'd want to wait, but even without that plan, you have VERY VALID reasons for needing to wait to purchase a ring.  Don't let them guilt you or strong-arm you into doing something you're not comfortable with or ready for.", "NTA; if that was so important to her she should have explicitly said so. You could also ask why she didn\u2019t work to save up for a ring and propose to you if this timeline was so paramount", "NTA but after she deals with her grief, decide if you still want to propose.", "If you\u2019d proposed early enough granny could\u2019ve got to see her married and divorced!

Again, She don\u2019t have your back!!", "NTA your girlfriend's family is out of line and she is being rude. So you would have had to get engaged a year plus ago for the wedding to be able to happen before grandma was too sick to attend. That is a crazy stick to measure when to get engaged by. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY are all AHs. And your gf is an AH. Are you sure want to marry THAT person?", "NAH Op your not a asshole for not proposing you might not be ready and that's ok, but your girlfriend and her family are grieving not your fault but that's how your girlfriend feels about the situation right now.

Likewise you are not NTA for wanting to be on a stable financial basis before proposing.  Likewise, while they are talking about your proposal it also sounds like they would have demanded that you rush the wedding as well.\n\nSo you have a couple of serious issues to consider now.  Granted your GF's family is in mourning and struggling to accept Grandmother's death, but their behaviour is still unacceptable, and your GF's behaviour is worse.  You need to be a team with your partner and be able to trust your partner will not only have your back but talk to you when there are problems.\n\nSo before agreeing to marry you need to agree on boundaries with yours and her families and  get a sensible and sane communication plan between the two of you.   I  suggest premarital counselling is something to consider as well.", "Nta if she wanted to get married so bad she could have proposed herself", "NTA , but do you really want to be in a relationship with someone so emotionally vindictive. Expect her to guilt you on a lot more of your 100% sound choices. Honestly kind of gross. I would request an apology from at least her, if not the family (considering they made it their business), before thinking about proposing.", "NTA. You're doing things the mature way by making sure you are actually prepared, meanwhile they wanted the optics. Her family was incredibly rude and passive aggressive to you. People get married much too quickly and you're doing the right thing by waiting.", "NTA but I do think that grief makes people do and say strange things. In the past year I have lost my mom, best friend, another friend and my dog. All due to either age or cancer. I find myself saying the most bizarre things, like my brain filter is gone.

However if your girlfriend was the one who was insistent on needing a fancy ring then you are not the asshole as she set her own timeline", "I think OP meant that his \"several failed relationships\" are why he wanted to wait at least 3 years before proposing, to make sure the relationship he was in was the right one before committing to it for life.", "She/they didn't just want a proposal.

That's a great plan for when you're going to buy a house, not marry a person.\n\nHis girlfriend shouldn't be irrelevant to his plans other than as the object of them. Have they even *talked* about marriage?", "You\u2019re NTA but\u2026 I think you should show your girlfriend and her family some grace, as well. It sounds like grandma was very dear to all of them and I suspect that their misplaced anger towards you is actually stemming from grief. It sounds like your girlfriend, in particular, may be struggling with the reality that a closed loved one of hers won\u2019t be able to see her get married. No sweet memories, no lovely pictures, just an empty chair on her side. Tbh, I understand that hurt in some ways. My dad passed away and my mom is getting older. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5+ years (on/off long distance) and I\u2019ve made it very, very clear to him that if I lose my mom before we get married, I will really struggle to move past that and our relationship probably won\u2019t last because I\u2019ll feel like I lost out on a really precious memory. No manipulation intended, but it\u2019s a fact (and no, neither of us are comfortable with me being the one to propose). It sounds like your girlfriend never communicated the importance of her grandma seeing her engagement, which is on her, frankly. \n\nThat said, I respect that you didn\u2019t want to rush into marriage. That\u2019s absolutely your right and as unfortunate as the situation is, you had valid reasons for waiting. I think the only \u201cassholish\u201d thing you might have done is set an arbitrary timeline. If you really felt confident about marrying her earlier, then I\u2019m not sure why you felt beholden to waiting 3 years even if the ring had to wait until you were more secure. Deep down, I personally think you may have had some misgivings about the relationship that you tried to ignore as you got closer to the 3 year mark because that became your vision of \u201csuccess.\u201d", "NTA. What stopped her from proposing?", "NTA. We got married last year, had a 11 month engagement and in that time all 3 remaining grandparents died. The other one died a week before the question was asked. It was tragic but you can't plan around other people, the future isn't guaranteed, you just have to do what's right for you and hope it works out. \n\nWe did have portraits of those we lost at the ceremony and mentioned them too. Maybe that's an option?", "NTA but she and her family are. You should seriously reconsider marrying her / into this family. They think it is more important that grandma sees a wedding over all other considerations like financial security, ensuring the relationship is what you both want, rushing into a marriage too young, etc. Just sick.", "NTA You should never plan your life around anyone else. Honestly, the whole family is a bag of red flags, your gf included. Their remarks were completely inappropriate and it is worse that she agreed with them. Use that information wisely to make a right choice. Engagements should not be rushed or forced to work around other peoples timelines.", "Nanna wouldn't see granddaughter's boyfriend break up with her and find a better girlfriend in a normal family. So what?\n\nNTA", "I often get confused about gaslighting, but this sounds like gaslighting.", "Nta but your gf sure is. You should tzke a good hard look at this situation and ask yourself if you really want to tie the knot with someone who a) expected you to be psuchic and to know when her grandmother would die, and b) get angry with you for not blowing moneyyou didnt have on her", "My grandma said the last thing she wanted to see before dying was me getting married. She passed, I'm still unmarried many years later, and I still think about this sometimes. I hate the sense I let her down in some fundamental way. I know she meant those words as an expression of love for me at the time, and not some kind of...familial curse...but it still hurts.\n\nThat being said, it never crossed my mind to blame or resent someone I was dating. I've never brought this up to a partner. No one should be placing this burden on you. There is only one good reason to get married, and it isn't to make grandma happy. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "So she wanted you propose at 24 after dating for like a year and a half? That\u2019s\u2026not a recipe for success. NTA.", "Or at least bring it up! The details of a proposal can be a surprise but the fact that one is coming shouldn't be. If she was expecting him to propose out of the blue without the two of them having had a discussion about their timeline for engagement and marriage and is now resentful that he didn't, she's way too immature to be married. This should not be the first that OP is ever hearing that she wanted him to propose sooner.", "Not haunt her \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s the thing she knew of our plans and was always okay with it now she\u2019s completely changed and I feel like her mother is talking to her.

That\u2019s not an excessive amount of time.\n\nBoth parties should feel completely ready for marriage, OP is not an AH for taking his time to feel comfortable.  The fact that the girlfriend and her family are lashing out at OP over something that was never even discussed lands them all in AH territory.  I get that they\u2019re grieving, but if their default method of coping is to lash out at OP, it\u2019s probably a good thing he\u2019s waited and he should wait even longer to really make sure this is something he wants to go through with.", "I am planning on asking her but as I said in the post I just now got a good job. She has little to no money so everything falls on me. I just wanted to be prepared I didn\u2019t even correlate grandmas passing with this and she never expressed she wanted to be married before grandma passed", "Yeah\u2026. If I were OP, I would have a REALLY bad taste in my mouth. Between the family\u2019s comments, GF refusing to stand up for him, and then her siding with her family\u2026 this is a HUGE taste of things to come. OP needs to take a pause and consider if this is what he wants out of life.", "Ah I see how it could read that way too! \n\nI still have the same thoughts about him being so young and having a lot ahead of him, regardless of how big those things seem now", "Right? Like was she just sitting there hoping OP would read her mind? \n\nStrange behaviour. If it was that important to her, she should have said something.", "Research shows that the most successful marriages (lowest divorce rate) are among couples who are together 4-5 years and are at least 25 years old before getting married.  That gives you the chance to experience tough things in life - the death of a loved one, job changes, etc - to see how you each handle it.  Knowing how someone handles difficult circumstances and whether you're good partners through those situations is important before deciding to get married.\n\nYou're getting to see what your girlfriend and her family are like in tough times.  Is this what you want to commit your life to?", "Don't hold yourself to that 3 year mark. There are red flags coming up and you need to make sure you want to marry this girl for the right reasons. \n\nYou should have a serious conversation with your gf on how this situation made you feel and ask her if this is how she really feels. Maybe wait a little while since she is still mourning and probably still emotionally reactive.", "Plenty of people \"know\" they want to marry someone while stupidly infatuated and later realize that they were an idiot. Setting a minimum relationship length before you're willing to propose to someone is smart. Especially if, like OP, you have a history of making bad relationship choices.", "No I didn\u2019t know that before. At the time marriage wasn\u2019t on my mind, I was broke and she knew that, I didn\u2019t have a good job or steady income so how was I supposed to afford a wedding or ring? Neither of our parents are in the position to help us either & she isn\u2019t in a high earning field. So it would all be dependent on me. As I said above I had a plan for very I\u2019d be by the 3rd year which she was cool with, now it\u2019s all shifted. And the timeline has moved up and I\u2019m in some ultimatum position", "It should go without saying that I\u2019m not talking about someone who decides they want to marry someone after two weeks.

Anger is a very common stage in grieving, it's likely that this is way their grief has manifested. That doesn't make their behavior appropriate, but knowing this might provide some insight into why they are acting like this, and how to deal with it going forward. It's hard to lose someone and realize that you will never get to go through big life moments with them.", "Of course NTA and her and her family are literal trash for saying those things.", "NTA. I\u2019d take some more time to see if you should marry her after getting this information.", "NTA - I know this is still unusual but if she wanted to get married sooner she could have proposed to you.

Why would she or the entire family wait all this time for a proposal and not communicate at all?", "NTA. They're trying to use her *dead grandmother* to guilt and manipulate you into proposing now.\n\n3 years is an arbitrary time frame you've decided on. My suggestion is that you dump this plan and decide to get engaged *only* when you can be sure that they aren't going to hold this over your head forever to get what they want. If you give in to this now, it will be buying a house you can't afford and children you aren't ready for because it's what a dead woman didn't get to see and somehow that makes it necessary to do things *right now*.\n\nMake sure you aren't doing what is expected of you because it's expected, but because you want to. You are still young, you don't have to rush things and 3 years is *not* a long time, especially at only 25. It feels like a long time, but it really isn't.", "nta but I also wouldn't hold what they say while mourning a loved one against them too much.

(Speaking from experience.) don\u2019t let her and her family project guilt and anxiety on you about it. Or at least, don\u2019t let it bother you since they ARE projecting.", "OP what was said was inappropriate. Remember that these people are grieving and maybe give them some benefit of the doubt. Especially if your relationship otherwise has not been adversarial or manipulative. \n\nNAH", "Also, OP it\u2019s not fair to yourself or the people you date to say \u201cWell if we get to the 3 year mark I guess I\u2019ll propose\u201d. Don\u2019t self impose a time frame like that from the get go. It should be a gradual ongoing conversation with both partners anyway. \n\nIf you\u2019re not excited to marry that specific person you shouldn\u2019t get engaged", "That\u2019s not at all a fair representation of what was said here - saying it\u2019s a shame the grandmother didn\u2019t see them get married is not \u201cyou better propose to me before my grandma dies\u201d - apart from anything it wasn\u2019t said until after the grandma died so the leverage for the manipulation that you claim has gone. Expressing a regret isn\u2019t a manipulating act. Telling you think it is though.\n\nIn this case the OP wants to propose but only on his own timetable - weird to me. The reasons don\u2019t make sense either - either you want to propose or you don\u2019t. What is the extra 6 months going to provide? Mind you gf might say no - as she doesn\u2019t appear to factor into OP\u2019s decision making process at all - not one mention of what she might want it feel even though it\u2019s her grandmother who died.", "Totally agree! My cousin proposed to his girlfriend when we knew our grandma was about to die because he wanted her to see one of the grandkids engaged. Turns out his girlfriend was terrible and they luckily broke it off before getting married. \n\nDon\u2019t let other people\u2019s lives determine what your should be doing in yours. Also from your comment \u201cthis is just something I\u2019ve told myself to do after several failed relationships\u201d you\u2019re not ready for this, take some time to yourself, you\u2019re on your own timetable, no one else\u2019s. NTA", "And so young! They're only 25!", "I agree that this isn\u2019t manipulation, or at least not in the way the top comment is saying, but it is a really weird guilt trip.\n\nIt sounds like OP and his girlfriend have discussed marriage already, which is why he\u2019s assuming she wants to marry him.\n\nAs for what six months more might show him, life often changes a lot in a few months when you\u2019re that young.  This is a great example.  Maybe it\u2019s just grief speaking, but it\u2019s speaking pretty unfairly.  If she persists in blaming OP like this I\u2019d want some couples counseling before getting engaged.\n\nNTA", "No, it was brought up extremely passive-aggressively and the gf only added to the passive aggressiveness when OP asked why she didn\u2019t defend him, it was still very much a jab at the fact he still hasn\u2019t proposed. It is a fair representation because the lot of them are using it as leverage to shame him for not proposing, which is what happened immediately after she died - barely as a regret. And if it\u2019s a regret they have a very shitty way of saying it and bringing it up.\n\nAre people not allowed to decide when they want to propose? He said that he wanted to wait until he recovered & felt financially secure so he could buy a proper ring - that is fine. And it is literally fine to give yourself time until you propose especially after having bad experiences from rushing, the point of dating to marry is to make sure you\u2019ve found your life partner, not marry someone within a year and divorce in two because you were rushed into the decision by social pressure telling you you\u2019re not allowed the time or boundaries to make this extremely important decision. Even you\u2019re shaming him for not proposing in a timeframe that you personally think is appropriate. What is 6 months? Enough to show their true colours and resentment, so yeah he was right to wait 3 years lmao", "Wait, is this the gf that doesn't want her family to know she's gay?", "You may want to put the breaks on moving in together if you can", "She should be working and not letting everything fall on you. I think you should wait to move in together", "Best advise my stepmom gave me was don't get married before you're 25", "My parents told me they would pay for the wedding if I waited until I was 25. I listened thank God! \nI tell my kids the same thing! Lol", "Tell her you'll think about proposing to your next gf before her grandma passes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nProposals happen (or don't happen) because you're ready for them. Emotionally, financially, in any aspect you need to feel ready. They shouldn't happen because of ultimatums. \n\nYou told yourself three years was your minimum to be ready for one but does your gf realise it may not be the exact time frame?", "If it\u2019s become an ultimatum, then you should say no even at risk of the relationship"]}
