Bragging about buying a cat is such a weird thing. Paying more for a cat literally just means you a) got it from a breeder or b) got scammed. Sometimes both. All cats are wonderful and your shelter cat is just as good as his new kitten. Tbh I got my cat for free and she's the most ridiculous gremlin, but it's also been the happiest time of my life. I understand your brother's excitement, but bragging about something so ridiculous just isn't the right move.", "NTA look I LOVE cats but its not wrong for you to be uninterested in the cat especially with him basically bragging. you where there hung out then left.", "When I had a relative try to flex on me over how her dog is an expensive purebred and mine is just a rescue mutt, my response was, \"My dog was abused and abandoned and I was lucky enough to be able to give him a good home and all the love he deserves. He's worth more than all the money and papers in the world.\" She never brought the subject up with me after that.", "NTA\n\nBut he is with how he's speaking about your cat.  That was actually quite nasty.", "I mean, you\u2019re NTA for leaving that conversation unless you left like an AH.\n\nAlso, my cat cost more money than your cat is a weird flex. I found my cat abandoned on the side of the road. This, plus shelters, plus a friend-of-a-friend is just how cats happen. Who buys cats?\n\nOh, DM me your brother\u2019s number tho. I have this great real estate investment that is only open to ten people and he won\u2019t want to miss out on this. I have one spot left if he has $10K.\n\n/s\n(Don\u2019t ban me.)", "NTA, and there\u2019s a big difference between \u201cworth more\u201d and \u201cpaid more\u201d", "NTA   What a weird flex.   I rescued my cats off the street and outside of vet bills and food and toys, they were free.   Wonder how much better he'd think of his cat over mine.  And they were precious.  It would be fighting words if he got rude about my babies.  LOL", "NTA, bragging about the amount of money spent on a pet is ridiculous and so embarrassingly immature??? like how did u win because you paid 2000 when you got the SAME THING for 100 \ud83d\ude2d That\u2019s like buying a one bedroom apartment for a million bucks and bragging to someone that has a 1 bedroom apartment and paid 20k \ud83d\udc80 like make it make sense bro how is yours better just cuz you spent more money? seems like he lost imo. Glad he\u2019s happy about his new kitty tho! Just don\u2019t understand what the point of bragging about the price was all about.", "Worth more to who?  I would leave as well, seriously, bragging about how much he paid for a cat?  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Bragging about how much you spent on a cat is not a flex \ud83d\udc80 i would rather have adopted my cat at a cheaper price than a more expensive price IMHO lol", "NTA.", "There are some people who have money to burn and purchase a pet from a breeder.

You understand there are plenty of animals waiting to be adopted or rescued from bad situations.  \n\nYour brother, having $ to burn, bought a special cat.  It seems like he wants others to fawn over it because it cost a lot.\n\nThat is where you brother may be the a$$.   Its like buying an expensive toy ( a car, a gaming system etc) and expecting others to gush over it.   It is flaunting his wealth.\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to participate in that, and leaving early.", "How cute and sweet a kitten is, is in no way related to its pedigree. My most beloved and devoted cat was an eight year old feral stray who just walked in and decided to stay. NTA.", "NTA. Bragging about how much money you spent on a cat is weird. Also adopting is also better. (Plz upvote this i need comment karma)", "NAH - To each his own. You aren\u2019t wrong for leaving if it was getting to you.

HE is a major AH!  AND, it\u2019s possible that he bought a kitten through a kitty mill which is so cruel!", "NTA but unless he intends to breed the cat for profit or show the cat (which is an expensive and frustrating process) then he is just bragging for his own ego and you were fine to leave. Listening to someone go on and on about what they (over)spent on anything is boring as hell.", "NTA.\nI don't get why he had to flaunt the cost and 'purity' of the cat so much..it makes me uncomfortable, like he'd hate it if it was cheaper and not purebred.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it's tacky and boring to talk about how expensive your cat is. \n\nAnd it's rude to say your cat is somehow worse because they're cheaper. Like, if yours needed a $10,000 surgery, would he suddenly be worth much more because the surgery was expensive? Or is a cat's intrinsic value tied to the fact that they look and act like a cat?
