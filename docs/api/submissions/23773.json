{"id": 23773, "submission_id": "15gzoxg", "title": "AITA for telling my sister's friend I'm married after being widowered for 20+ years?", "selftext": "I lost my wife Lana 20 years ago after the birth of our son. Lana and I were childhood sweethearts who  saw ourselves growing old together. She was my everything. But during her pregnancy they discovered she had cancer and because she was already terminal, she dedicated the final months of her life to giving birth to a healthy son and making sure he and I would be okay. She died hours after he was born. The pregnancy as well as the delivery (c-section) weakened her significantly. Only living long enough to get one photo with him. It was such a painful time. And I always knew I would consider myself married until I pass away as well. \n\nThis was difficult for my family to understand. I was 26. They felt like I was young enough to bounce back fast and remarry and continue life with a new family and new love. But that never held any interest for me. I have never taken off my wedding ring. I have been asked out over the years and I always say no, and if pushed that I am married, and people rarely ask questions. Over the years my family have introduced me to women who they think could be the one to change my mind. It is something we have disagreed over. They even asked my son if he wouldn't like a new mommy when he was little and it resulted in no contact for a while. They eventually apologized.\n\nMy sister and her husband celebrated 30 years of marriage last month and they threw a party with family and friends. My sister invited a friend of hers along who I have never met. She started talking to me during the party and mentioned that my sister said we would be perfect for each other, and how she was excited for us to spend some time together after the party. I asked her what she meant by that and she said we were going out to dinner, just the two of us, right after. I told her I never agreed to that and then I told her I was married. She got the idea that I was divorced. I told her that my wife had passed away many years ago but I considered myself still married. She was shocked and afterward my sister was angry at me. She told me I had made her out to be a liar and her friend was hurt that she tried to set her up with someone who was so hung up on someone else. I told her I had made it perfectly clear I would not be dating. That she was the one who gave her friend the impression I wanted to date. She told me telling people I'm married when I'm not anymore is wrong. That it pushes people away and gives them the wrong idea. \n\nI left early because she was not willing to let it go. Afterward my BIL said my sister meant well and I have to understand where the concern comes from because even though I found my own happiness, it's not the way my family wanted me to and they worry even more now my son's in college.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691056382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gzoxg/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_friend_im_married/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to say something like this to stop the dating questions. I could always say I'm a widower I suppose.

Even if that were true, again, *not their damn business.* Not even if eventually you change your mind, in fact, especially if you do, that isn\u2019t their business and then trying to force it is rude, condescending, meddling, patronizing, and crosses several lines and boundaries which you seem to have been extremely clear about. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t judge you if you go NC to your sister and her dumbfork bf. I know they\u2019re married but his comment is dumb bf material.", "NTA x1000\n\nWe lost my dad suddenly, to leukemia, when I was very young. He and my mom had had their first 'kiss' in kindergarten. My mom's side was a big family, and the pressure and expectation to remarry and expand the family was immense. But she was still in love with my dad.... Friends and family had such an entrenched view of what her life should look like, it eventually fractured us a bit away from the family. The only relief from the constant meddling was to be absent. That lack of respect and connection was even tougher on my mom. She survived with a few understanding friends, work, and kids that were emotionally with her 100%.\n\nWhenever holidays rolled around and we had to listen to the inevitable lecture about how they only wanted the best, and were looking out for her, mom would sigh, eye roll and say 'No, you just want what you want, you want what makes you happy. If you wanted what best for me, you would respect my choice' That woman understood grey rocking before it was a thing.\n\nMuch after you, she married a  fellow who had also lost his wife, that had been in my parents friend circle after high school. He's a cool guy...who endured similar relationship strong arming. If you talk to them about it, they'll tell you that they had their 'one and only loves' but they now love being old farts with amazing company on the road to the end.\n\nYour live your life OP, your all right", "NTA. You've made your position clear. People don't have to agree with that position, but they should respect it. It was your sister who put her friend (and you) in an awkward position.

Even if a person is completely single, if they don't want a relationship they aren't available. And your sister hurt her friend because she thinks she knows better for *both* of you.\n\nI feel so bad for your sister's friend. I can't imagine being set up with someone, only to find out that they were still desperately in love with someone else, living or dead. I'd feel so betrayed, so embarrassed, that anyone, let alone a *friend*, could do that to me. To be left standing in the middle of a party celebrating love, thinking there was a chance of forming a love of my own and a lovely story to go with it, and then realising that my friend set me up with someone unavailable *on purpose*. And wondering what I did to deserve that.\n\nYou did the right thing. You were completely honest with her about your situation. In doing so she knows that it isn't about her, it's about your sister.

Because your sister thought she was right, and she didn't think about how many people it would hurt  when she wasn't.", "NTA\n\nWhy do people think \"moving on\" after losing the love of your life is even required?

If you and your son are happy, then what is there to discuss?", "NTA.  Sounds like it may be time for another round of LC/NC.  Your family needs to accept your choice.", "NTA: others have said it, and I'll say it too: this is your life, you get to define it.\n\nAnd by the way, if, 6 months from now or 10 years from now you wake up one morning and decide, \"hey, I think I'd like to be with someone again\" you are still NTA for all the times you said no in the past.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Telling people you\u2019re married is the truth for you, while pretending to be available when you are completely uninterested would be giving them the wrong idea.

It wasn\u2019t just yours (which honestly at this point is utter gall), but also the woman she manipulated into the situation with misleading, deceptive information. It\u2019s boarding on cruelty. \n\nShe has to stop, not only is it stressful for you and any other parties she leads down this insane pathway, it\u2019s also bad for her.

It's a level of pain I didn't know was possible while at the same time feeling so empty and that a piece of me is missing. A vital piece. I feel like I died too. It's so complex.\n\nPeople mean well.

Lana and I were childhood sweethearts who  saw ourselves growing old together. She was my everything. But during her pregnancy they discovered she had cancer and because she was already terminal, she dedicated the final months of her life to giving birth to a healthy son and making sure he and I would be okay. She died hours after he was born. The pregnancy as well as the delivery (c-section) weakened her significantly. Only living long enough to get one photo with him. It was such a painful time.

You are wrong in claiming you\u2019re still married.  Rachel Dolazol is white, and you are a widower and therefore single.  Being single doesn\u2019t mean you have to date, and it doesn\u2019t give your family license to set you up against your wishes.  But you are still single.  Feelings aren\u2019t facts.\n2.
