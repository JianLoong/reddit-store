Lana and I were childhood sweethearts who  saw ourselves growing old together. She was my everything. But during her pregnancy they discovered she had cancer and because she was already terminal, she dedicated the final months of her life to giving birth to a healthy son and making sure he and I would be okay. She died hours after he was born. The pregnancy as well as the delivery (c-section) weakened her significantly. Only living long enough to get one photo with him. It was such a painful time. And I always knew I would consider myself married until I pass away as well. \n\nThis was difficult for my family to understand. I was 26. They felt like I was young enough to bounce back fast and remarry and continue life with a new family and new love. But that never held any interest for me. I have never taken off my wedding ring. I have been asked out over the years and I always say no, and if pushed that I am married, and people rarely ask questions. Over the years my family have introduced me to women who they think could be the one to change my mind. It is something we have disagreed over. They even asked my son if he wouldn't like a new mommy when he was little and it resulted in no contact for a while. They eventually apologized.\n\nMy sister and her husband celebrated 30 years of marriage last month and they threw a party with family and friends. My sister invited a friend of hers along who I have never met. She started talking to me during the party and mentioned that my sister said we would be perfect for each other, and how she was excited for us to spend some time together after the party. I asked her what she meant by that and she said we were going out to dinner, just the two of us, right after. I told her I never agreed to that and then I told her I was married. She got the idea that I was divorced. I told her that my wife had passed away many years ago but I considered myself still married. She was shocked and afterward my sister was angry at me. She told me I had made her out to be a liar and her friend was hurt that she tried to set her up with someone who was so hung up on someone else. I told her I had made it perfectly clear I would not be dating. That she was the one who gave her friend the impression I wanted to date. She told me telling people I'm married when I'm not anymore is wrong. That it pushes people away and gives them the wrong idea. \n\nI left early because she was not willing to let it go. Afterward my BIL said my sister meant well and I have to understand where the concern comes from because even though I found my own happiness, it's not the way my family wanted me to and they worry even more now my son's in college.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691056382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gzoxg/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_friend_im_married/", "score": 469, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to say something like this to stop the dating questions. I could always say I'm a widower I suppose.

My mom's side was a big family, and the pressure and expectation to remarry and expand the family was immense. But she was still in love with my dad.... Friends and family had such an entrenched view of what her life should look like, it eventually fractured us a bit away from the family. The only relief from the constant meddling was to be absent. That lack of respect and connection was even tougher on my mom. She survived with a few understanding friends, work, and kids that were emotionally with her 100%.\n\nWhenever holidays rolled around and we had to listen to the inevitable lecture about how they only wanted the best, and were looking out for her, mom would sigh, eye roll and say 'No, you just want what you want, you want what makes you happy. If you wanted what best for me, you would respect my choice' That woman understood grey rocking before it was a thing.\n\nMuch after you, she married a  fellow who had also lost his wife, that had been in my parents friend circle after high school. He's a cool guy...who endured similar relationship strong arming.

I can't imagine being set up with someone, only to find out that they were still desperately in love with someone else, living or dead. I'd feel so betrayed, so embarrassed, that anyone, let alone a *friend*, could do that to me. To be left standing in the middle of a party celebrating love, thinking there was a chance of forming a love of my own and a lovely story to go with it, and then realising that my friend set me up with someone unavailable *on purpose*. And wondering what I did to deserve that.\n\nYou did the right thing. You were completely honest with her about your situation. In doing so she knows that it isn't about her, it's about your sister.

That phrase is used to steamroll other people's decisions because they don't agree with them. Just because they disagree with OP's life choices doesn't mean OP is wrong.", "Seconding NC!  Still NTA.", "Yeah great idea cut off the rest of his family", "Should check out The Good Place lol", "You already found your heartbeat. The other half of your soul. You don't usually find that again. Maybe someday you'll find a partner to experience life with, even just friends, but that is 110% up to you. It's not for others to push on you. \n\nI'm so sorry she was taken too soon. I'm really happy you found her and experienced that great love.", "I'm very sorry for your loss, I'm sure even after all these years, it must still hurt very much.\n\nI've been on my own for 9 years, nothing traumatic, just left an abusive husband, but nothing could persuade me to get into a relationship again, you are responsible for your own happiness, and if you're happy living as you are, it's honestly nobody else's business (even that of your own family).", "I'm single at 40 and love it. So peaceful.", "Then they need to understand and respect that you are inside a marriage and that you have a family with your spouse.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck with people who aren\u2019t listening to you about something so important. If you want to try drawing a line after this I would genuinely recommend inviting them to a family meeting and asking them to let you speak and to listen before responding, because you need them to hear you out without interruptions and that this is about something incredibly serious and important to you.\n\nThen be very clear and simple: you understand they worry about you, but their collective continued attempts to arrange relationships for you or push you toward them are hurting you and dragging up your grief. If that will ever be welcome, you will tell them so in explicit terms, but until you say otherwise you need them to assume it will never be a welcome conversation. Nobody gets to tell you that you\u2019re not married to the love of your life, nor what being married to her means to you. Nobody but you gets to say that you need more than the family you have. This is not a matter for family opinion, it\u2019s not a referendum; those decisions are *utterly personal* to you. Attempts to push you into feeling or acting otherwise cannot and will never change your feelings about your wife or your life. The only thing those things can damage is the relationship between you and the people who make these attempts.\n\nBe clear you don\u2019t want that, because you love them and they love you and (even though it would be very fair to be less forgiving, it may be worth smoothing this over by saying) you understand people are just expressing worry and don\u2019t realise that they are causing hurt and pushing you away. Say that because of that, you felt it was important to not let the hurt it\u2019s causing fester, so you can all move forward.\n\nThen be clear that what you need from them in future is a simple change in acceptance: acceptance that your feelings for your wife haven\u2019t changed and that your right to mourn her and hold her in your heart as you choose is sacrosanct to you. From now on, you need them not to push you into relationships, and you need that *especially* if they do ever hope to see you in one again, because pressure to move toward other relationships when you\u2019re not ready actively lowers the chances of you ever doing so. Be clear that if it comes up again, you will remind them once, and then you will just politely remove yourself from the conversation - or from the event - and give the person who is coming on too strong some distance for a while so they can reset to respecting this.\n\nThen let them have their feelings about it, and then - very simply - say this wasn\u2019t a discussion, it was information. You have *told* them how this is going to be from now on; you love their company, but nothing about your marriage and your life as a widower is up for debate or negotiation. You\u2019d love to move on to spend the rest of the day having dinner and catching up with the air clear, and anyone who isn\u2019t ready to do that is welcome to head out and get back in touch when they\u2019re feeling more settled with the new situation.\n\nYou can draw lines. You can call this out. You can set yourself up to say \u201cremember when we discussed how I don\u2019t appreciate you telling me how to grieve? I\u2019m going to head home and we can talk in a few months when you\u2019ve spent some time recalling the proper way to behave about this, or sooner when you feel like apologising.\u201d Start pushing back. You don\u2019t have to just take this level of disrespect.", "Even if they believe that, pushing you on it instead of letting you do it when you feel ready destroys their whole point to begin with.\n\nIf it\u2019ll happen it\u2019ll happen on your terms and when you feel comfortable, not with begging and pleading from your family, because you won\u2019t be happy that way.", "NTA warn them you will be even more lonely if you have to go no contact cause they refuse to treat you like bathe adult you are and respect your boundaries.", "This is beautiful!", "You are exactly right!  Time is such a weird concept.", "She makes herself look bad. I\u2019m sorry she cares about her appearance more than your happiness.", "you\u2019re not a bull. she doesn\u2019t get to put you in a field with whoever she wants and expect magical romance to happen. you\u2019re a person. you decide who you date. you decide if you date. you decide if you\u2019re done dating for life, and you decide if that has changed. it is absolutely none of her business. if you have a friend who\u2019s up for it i would be so tempted to show up with him at her next event and casually mention that the two of them have a date later. and he\u2019s really looking forward to it. she\u2019ll make you look bad if she says no. in fact, she needs to commit to this relationship. \n\nno? she\u2019s not interested? funny how that didn\u2019t make a difference when it was you.\n\n(don\u2019t actually do this. it\u2019s a nice thought, though. bonus points for telling bil this is the way you want her to find happiness.)\n\nnta. i\u2019m sorry for your loss. congrats on your son going to college.", "Yeah, she made herself look bad by being a shitty friend to the innocent lady she tried to set you up with and even worse for not respecting your wishes after YEARS. Like damn can they not see you have made your decision and are sticking to it?\n\nAdditionally, respect for standing your ground. I know it's hard to do with family, but it's necessary at times unfortunately.", "And my reply specifically says that I agree that you don\u2019t need another partner if you don\u2019t want one. It also says that your family was being very disrespectful.\n\nNone of that is mutually exclusive with you being incorrect when you say you ARE married.  You WERE married.  If you can\u2019t concede that, that\u2019s your issue.", "I\u2019m not deciding if he\u2019s married.  It\u2019s the definition of a commonly known word doing the heavy lifting.\n\nAnd to be clear, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s disgusting that a \u201cReddit stranger\u201d judges someone who asked to be judged?  That\u2019s a hot take if you understand what this sub is about.\n\nAnd you seemed to miss that I agreed his family (mainly sister) are at fault here and I agreed he can live his life the way he wants to.  The only improvement would be if he told the woman at the party a more accurate reason such as \u201cI\u2019m not available\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m sorry my sister mislead you\u201d.", "Which is again 100 percent your right. \n\nBut please remember as annoying as your family are being it's because they love you and have relationships that bring them joy, so they worry that your missing out on joy. \n\nI hope you all can sort it out, it'd be a shame for a family to fall apart because everyone loves too much...", "Also before I leave if you haven't already, look at talking to a therapist because while you're not holding onto that pain, it always helps just to talk about with someone.", "Another things I want to add is in regards to your mentioning of your son, while your son very clearly turned out just fine considering kids from single father homes tend be better off than single mother homes, that's mitigated by the fact that kids from single parent homes are statistically still much more like to be delinquent, commit crimes and go to prison compared to kids in two parent homes. So while they were in the wrong for asking your son that, I can understand why they asked the question.\n\nAgain ESH, as the things both of you guys could have done to approach the situation better. That's where I'm going to end my engagement on the post, I hope you continue to do and be well and stay safe.", "Do you have good friends? I hope so, because if your only confidante is your son, that\u2019s going to change soon as he is getting older and it\u2019s not fair to place that burden on him. If I was your sister this would be my greatest concern, not getting you laid. \n\nNTA- but make sure you have some good friends, I know many people who never remarried, or dated but had great friendships. You deserve that, your wife would want that for you.", "I wish you luck, good job with son! Maybe another round of no speaking is due?", "Yes I see your point, but I do think she could've been a bit more subtle regardless - I can't imagine introducing myself to a man and announcing 'hey, we've been fixed up on a blind date!' without a bit of pre-emptive conversation, as much for my own option to cancel, as for him to do so. Would've been easy to just introduce herself and chat, and see how that went initially.\n\nIf OP does ever meet someone who'll change how he feels - which of course he's not open to - it would be unlikely to work if he were to feel 'set up' in any way whatsoever.", "U and my mom lol she\u2019s been telling me to watch that as well as shitscreek idk if I spelled that right.", "He didn't get a divorce, he's still married if he wants to be. Who are you to say otherwise?", "You know you can be married without a piece of paper right? People did it for centuries before colonization.", "At some point they need to let this go. They already came close to losing me when they tried to involve my young son. That should have been the end of it. I was furious with them for that. Still isn't enough for them to let it go.", "I have seen a therapist before. I'm glad I did. But I don't feel as though I need to go back to therapy.", "I have a number of friends. Both very close friends and friends who aren't very close but we could be considered friends. I also have other family in my MIL, SIL, SILs husband and their children who I'm uncle to. I have more people than just my son.", "I really doubt that woman would have been that forward if she didn\u2019t believe OP knew about the date already. No one walks up to someone they literally just met and starts talking about a blind date out of thin air. The woman didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t know about it. The sister must have arranged it with the plan to trap her brother and make him feel too guilty to back out as a way to pressure him to go on the date.", "He describes it that they started talking, she said sister thought they\u2019d be perfect together and she was looking forward to getting to know him. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem too out of place for a conversation with some one you\u2019ve been set up with. The only awkward part is no one told Him about the set up.", "Schitts creek is great!", "Please don't listen to this person! If your family really loves you so much they will except what you want! Instead they are making it about what they want! They don't have to understand it but they do have to respect your boundaries! NTA", "She must have liked the look of him, maybe she blurted it out a bit too soon in her excitement to meet him. It's just awful for both parties; OP's sister is seriously out of order for fantasising a dinner date."]}
