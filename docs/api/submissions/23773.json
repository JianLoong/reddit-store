Lana and I were childhood sweethearts who  saw ourselves growing old together. She was my everything. But during her pregnancy they discovered she had cancer and because she was already terminal, she dedicated the final months of her life to giving birth to a healthy son and making sure he and I would be okay. She died hours after he was born. The pregnancy as well as the delivery (c-section) weakened her significantly. Only living long enough to get one photo with him. It was such a painful time. And I always knew I would consider myself married until I pass away as well. \n\nThis was difficult for my family to understand. I was 26. They felt like I was young enough to bounce back fast and remarry and continue life with a new family and new love. But that never held any interest for me. I have never taken off my wedding ring. I have been asked out over the years and I always say no, and if pushed that I am married, and people rarely ask questions. Over the years my family have introduced me to women who they think could be the one to change my mind. It is something we have disagreed over. They even asked my son if he wouldn't like a new mommy when he was little and it resulted in no contact for a while. They eventually apologized.\n\nMy sister and her husband celebrated 30 years of marriage last month and they threw a party with family and friends. My sister invited a friend of hers along who I have never met. She started talking to me during the party and mentioned that my sister said we would be perfect for each other, and how she was excited for us to spend some time together after the party. I asked her what she meant by that and she said we were going out to dinner, just the two of us, right after. I told her I never agreed to that and then I told her I was married. She got the idea that I was divorced. I told her that my wife had passed away many years ago but I considered myself still married. She was shocked and afterward my sister was angry at me. She told me I had made her out to be a liar and her friend was hurt that she tried to set her up with someone who was so hung up on someone else. I told her I had made it perfectly clear I would not be dating. That she was the one who gave her friend the impression I wanted to date. She told me telling people I'm married when I'm not anymore is wrong. That it pushes people away and gives them the wrong idea. \n\nI left early because she was not willing to let it go. Afterward my BIL said my sister meant well and I have to understand where the concern comes from because even though I found my own happiness, it's not the way my family wanted me to and they worry even more now my son's in college.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691056382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gzoxg/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_friend_im_married/", "score": 6562, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to say something like this to stop the dating questions. I could always say I'm a widower I suppose.

My mom's side was a big family, and the pressure and expectation to remarry and expand the family was immense. But she was still in love with my dad.... Friends and family had such an entrenched view of what her life should look like, it eventually fractured us a bit away from the family. The only relief from the constant meddling was to be absent. That lack of respect and connection was even tougher on my mom. She survived with a few understanding friends, work, and kids that were emotionally with her 100%.\n\nWhenever holidays rolled around and we had to listen to the inevitable lecture about how they only wanted the best, and were looking out for her, mom would sigh, eye roll and say 'No, you just want what you want, you want what makes you happy. If you wanted what best for me, you would respect my choice' That woman understood grey rocking before it was a thing.\n\nMuch after you, she married a  fellow who had also lost his wife, that had been in my parents friend circle after high school. He's a cool guy...who endured similar relationship strong arming.

I can't imagine being set up with someone, only to find out that they were still desperately in love with someone else, living or dead. I'd feel so betrayed, so embarrassed, that anyone, let alone a *friend*, could do that to me. To be left standing in the middle of a party celebrating love, thinking there was a chance of forming a love of my own and a lovely story to go with it, and then realising that my friend set me up with someone unavailable *on purpose*. And wondering what I did to deserve that.\n\nYou did the right thing. You were completely honest with her about your situation. In doing so she knows that it isn't about her, it's about your sister.

If you want to try drawing a line after this I would genuinely recommend inviting them to a family meeting and asking them to let you speak and to listen before responding, because you need them to hear you out without interruptions and that this is about something incredibly serious and important to you.\n\nThen be very clear and simple: you understand they worry about you, but their collective continued attempts to arrange relationships for you or push you toward them are hurting you and dragging up your grief. If that will ever be welcome, you will tell them so in explicit terms, but until you say otherwise you need them to assume it will never be a welcome conversation. Nobody gets to tell you that you\u2019re not married to the love of your life, nor what being married to her means to you. Nobody but you gets to say that you need more than the family you have. This is not a matter for family opinion, it\u2019s not a referendum; those decisions are *utterly personal* to you. Attempts to push you into feeling or acting otherwise cannot and will never change your feelings about your wife or your life. The only thing those things can damage is the relationship between you and the people who make these attempts.\n\nBe clear you don\u2019t want that, because you love them and they love you and (even though it would be very fair to be less forgiving, it may be worth smoothing this over by saying) you understand people are just expressing worry and don\u2019t realise that they are causing hurt and pushing you away. Say that because of that, you felt it was important to not let the hurt it\u2019s causing fester, so you can all move forward.\n\nThen be clear that what you need from them in future is a simple change in acceptance: acceptance that your feelings for your wife haven\u2019t changed and that your right to mourn her and hold her in your heart as you choose is sacrosanct to you. From now on, you need them not to push you into relationships, and you need that *especially* if they do ever hope to see you in one again, because pressure to move toward other relationships when you\u2019re not ready actively lowers the chances of you ever doing so. Be clear that if it comes up again, you will remind them once, and then you will just politely remove yourself from the conversation - or from the event - and give the person who is coming on too strong some distance for a while so they can reset to respecting this.\n\nThen let them have their feelings about it, and then - very simply - say this wasn\u2019t a discussion, it was information. You have *told* them how this is going to be from now on; you love their company, but nothing about your marriage and your life as a widower is up for debate or negotiation.

You can call this out. You can set yourself up to say \u201cremember when we discussed how I don\u2019t appreciate you telling me how to grieve? I\u2019m going to head home and we can talk in a few months when you\u2019ve spent some time recalling the proper way to behave about this, or sooner when you feel like apologising.\u201d Start pushing back.

Your family may be worried that you may decline without a partner or family living at home as you age.", "Short answer: the reason behind your choice to not date anyone else is actually completely irrelevant. Dating and pursuing/having a romantic relationship is not (or should not be) a requirement for anyone.  You have every right to decide whether or not you want to have a(nother) partner or not. The end.\n\nLong answer: Life is full of twists and turns; rarely does life go how we planned. Your plan A was to have a long and happy life raising your son with your wife; sadly, your plan A was stolen from you, and you were forced to make a plan B.  Your plan B did not include finding another romantic partner (valid choice), but to find a different kind of life full of it's own kinds of joy, in spite of your wife's absence. \n\nJust because your Plan A for your life included having a partner (your wife, of course), does not mean that your Plan B requires you to do the same. Being in a romantic relationship is not a requirement to having a fulfilling and happy life.\n\nMy only caution/caveat is to remind you we only get one shot at this whole \"life\" thing (any reincarnation belief systems, aside). If your choice to not find a new partner in the absence of your wife is a decision you're making because it's not something YOU want for yourself, and you are fulfilled and content in that choice for yourself, then you should do exactly that. If, however, you're choosing stay single in your widowerhood because you feel it's your duty or loyalty to your late wife deny yourself the possibility of being happy in another partnership, I would STILL encourage you to do what you believe is right, but also gently encourage you to speak to a therapist. Choosing a life that is unfulfilled or unhappy simply because your plan A was not an available option is not a healthy way to live this precious little time we get on this planet.", "In my opinion, definitely NTA.

If you had an only daughter, would you be happy that she felt the need to marry just to give you a son (in-law)?

If you want a relationship but are having difficulty finding one, then that is a skill you can hone through practice and persistence.

My friend's mom has never removed her ring, and as far as she and the rest of the universe are concerned, even death did not mean they parted. I'm so sorry for your loss, and you yourself sound like \"an amazingly beautiful person.\"\n\nOP, you are NTA. Your boundary is well-established, reasonable, and easily understood. In future interactions with your sister, may I suggest you be ever mindful that this person will not respect boundaries and will completely ignore them to advance their own agenda. All my best, OP. As WR3H suggested above, you sound like an amazingly beautiful person.", "That's society for you. Seems like you're a nobody if you're not in a relationship.\nI've been divorced 5 years and ahev no desire to date. I like my life and i don't need anyone complicating it. People can't seem to understand that people can actually be perfectly happy alone. A lot of my friends who are married aren't exactly happy and just staying for convenience. That's much sadder than being single. \n\nThing is even if you weren't a widow and were divorced. Or even if you had never been married and wanted to just stay single? It's no one's business but yours if you want to stay single. Doesn't matter the reason. Just because you're alone doesn't mean you can't be happy but people don't seem to want to accept that. There must be something wrong with people who don't want to be in a relationship. But seriously, relationships are overrated. I'd rather be single than settling for someone so that I can live up to soem studies societal standard.\n\nYour sister was an AH. First of all she made it sound like you were divorced and she knew damn well what she was doing was wrong because otherwise she would have told about it ahead of time.\n\nYou're allowed to stay single and you're allowed to say you're married. Just like when women lose a baby theyre still a mom, just not of a live baby. It's no one business how you present yourself. \n\nI'd tell your family that you're letting them know one last time that you consider yourself married and have no interest in dating anyone. And that you are perfectly happy on your own. And tell them if anyone goes against your wishes and challenges you again then go no contact and follow through with it. Let them focus on their own relationships and stay our of yours", "Stop lying.", "He is still a liar. Or delusional. He's not married. She's dead. Its a lie.", "We should start a widows club. Those of us that have commented. No one else understands. When I first lost him just a few months ago I tried in vain to find a grief group, any kind of grief group near me. Never mind a specific kind.", "Yeah. My grandma never even thought of another man. All those years she was \u201cfaithful\u201d. It wasn\u2019t gainful it was her living as if she were still married\u2026I believe. She\u2019s a strong old lady. \ud83d\ude02. Love her to death.", "I already made it clear if my husband dies that's it. Highschool sweethearts, 19 years and still madly in love. We plan to grow old and wrinkly with each other.

They are showing a blatant disrespect of what OP wants. They need to respect that OP doesn't want to meet another woman.", "I legit cried when I read that.", "Did you keep watching Schitt\u2019s Creek?  The first season, I believe, is purposely cringey and uncomfortable, and after that they all start growing and becoming more tolerable. I\u2019m glad my daughter told me to keep pushing through.", "Ask your family, BIL included, if their spouse died, how long until they plan on getting remarried. They consistently make you face the loss of your partner, so they can handle facing it one time in hypothetical. Make them face it.\n\nYou didn\u2019t *make* your sister out to be a liar, **she is a liar**. She told her friend that you were looking for a relationship and you are not. That is a lie\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years friend; this is well past the point of \u201cfamily looking out for your happiness\u201d. Family must mean a hell of a lot to you, because I\u2019d be NC with all of them by year **5** *at most*", "When it comes to losing a partner/spouse, the way you deal with it is up to you and you alone. If you want to date again, go for it, do what makes you happy. If you never want to date again, that is fine too. Maybe you\u2019ll change your mind, maybe you won\u2019t. Maybe you\u2019ll want a more casual companionship, or a non romantic best friend/partner situation just for company, but again, maybe you won\u2019t! Whatever you choose, do it because that is what feels right and what brings you comfort.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you and your wife were cheated out of a life together so young, that is awful and should never have happened - fuck cancer. But I just want to say well done for pushing through and raising your son, through him a little bit of your wife lives on. Keep your head up, and honestly I\u2019d go NC for a while and expect an apology too; a proper one and not one with bullshit excuses. You should flip their own argument against them and tell them that their incessant nagging puts you off even more (even if you never have any intention of considering a date) and the more they try the more uncomfortable you feel about all of it. Watch them try and dig themselves out of that one!\n\nBut yeah, hard NTA", "You told the woman your wife died. If she thinks your sister is a liar, that's between the two of them\n\nNTA", "Projecting much", "No. If someone has told you to stop doing something for 20+ years hell even one time and you continue to do it, you are not a good person. You are not respectful of that person. Your intentions do not matter someone has said stop. so you stop.", "Rare is an understatement on a subreddit where any time someone in a relationship acts like an AH, everyone tells the OP to run for their lives. It's hard for people nowadays to even consider commitment for a few years, let alone the hereafter. And yet most people will remarry or try to and that's fine too.", "Yeah this sounds a lot like \"I'll take Things that never happened for $200 Alex\""]}
