Lana and I were childhood sweethearts who  saw ourselves growing old together. She was my everything. But during her pregnancy they discovered she had cancer and because she was already terminal, she dedicated the final months of her life to giving birth to a healthy son and making sure he and I would be okay. She died hours after he was born. The pregnancy as well as the delivery (c-section) weakened her significantly. Only living long enough to get one photo with him. It was such a painful time. And I always knew I would consider myself married until I pass away as well. \n\nThis was difficult for my family to understand. I was 26. They felt like I was young enough to bounce back fast and remarry and continue life with a new family and new love. But that never held any interest for me. I have never taken off my wedding ring. I have been asked out over the years and I always say no, and if pushed that I am married, and people rarely ask questions. Over the years my family have introduced me to women who they think could be the one to change my mind. It is something we have disagreed over. They even asked my son if he wouldn't like a new mommy when he was little and it resulted in no contact for a while. They eventually apologized.\n\nMy sister and her husband celebrated 30 years of marriage last month and they threw a party with family and friends. My sister invited a friend of hers along who I have never met. She started talking to me during the party and mentioned that my sister said we would be perfect for each other, and how she was excited for us to spend some time together after the party. I asked her what she meant by that and she said we were going out to dinner, just the two of us, right after. I told her I never agreed to that and then I told her I was married. She got the idea that I was divorced. I told her that my wife had passed away many years ago but I considered myself still married. She was shocked and afterward my sister was angry at me. She told me I had made her out to be a liar and her friend was hurt that she tried to set her up with someone who was so hung up on someone else. I told her I had made it perfectly clear I would not be dating. That she was the one who gave her friend the impression I wanted to date. She told me telling people I'm married when I'm not anymore is wrong. That it pushes people away and gives them the wrong idea. \n\nI left early because she was not willing to let it go. Afterward my BIL said my sister meant well and I have to understand where the concern comes from because even though I found my own happiness, it's not the way my family wanted me to and they worry even more now my son's in college.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691056382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gzoxg/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_friend_im_married/", "score": 1999, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to say something like this to stop the dating questions. I could always say I'm a widower I suppose.

My mom's side was a big family, and the pressure and expectation to remarry and expand the family was immense. But she was still in love with my dad.... Friends and family had such an entrenched view of what her life should look like, it eventually fractured us a bit away from the family. The only relief from the constant meddling was to be absent. That lack of respect and connection was even tougher on my mom. She survived with a few understanding friends, work, and kids that were emotionally with her 100%.\n\nWhenever holidays rolled around and we had to listen to the inevitable lecture about how they only wanted the best, and were looking out for her, mom would sigh, eye roll and say 'No, you just want what you want, you want what makes you happy. If you wanted what best for me, you would respect my choice' That woman understood grey rocking before it was a thing.\n\nMuch after you, she married a  fellow who had also lost his wife, that had been in my parents friend circle after high school. He's a cool guy...who endured similar relationship strong arming.

I can't imagine being set up with someone, only to find out that they were still desperately in love with someone else, living or dead. I'd feel so betrayed, so embarrassed, that anyone, let alone a *friend*, could do that to me. To be left standing in the middle of a party celebrating love, thinking there was a chance of forming a love of my own and a lovely story to go with it, and then realising that my friend set me up with someone unavailable *on purpose*. And wondering what I did to deserve that.\n\nYou did the right thing. You were completely honest with her about your situation. In doing so she knows that it isn't about her, it's about your sister.

If you want to try drawing a line after this I would genuinely recommend inviting them to a family meeting and asking them to let you speak and to listen before responding, because you need them to hear you out without interruptions and that this is about something incredibly serious and important to you.\n\nThen be very clear and simple: you understand they worry about you, but their collective continued attempts to arrange relationships for you or push you toward them are hurting you and dragging up your grief. If that will ever be welcome, you will tell them so in explicit terms, but until you say otherwise you need them to assume it will never be a welcome conversation. Nobody gets to tell you that you\u2019re not married to the love of your life, nor what being married to her means to you. Nobody but you gets to say that you need more than the family you have. This is not a matter for family opinion, it\u2019s not a referendum; those decisions are *utterly personal* to you. Attempts to push you into feeling or acting otherwise cannot and will never change your feelings about your wife or your life. The only thing those things can damage is the relationship between you and the people who make these attempts.\n\nBe clear you don\u2019t want that, because you love them and they love you and (even though it would be very fair to be less forgiving, it may be worth smoothing this over by saying) you understand people are just expressing worry and don\u2019t realise that they are causing hurt and pushing you away. Say that because of that, you felt it was important to not let the hurt it\u2019s causing fester, so you can all move forward.\n\nThen be clear that what you need from them in future is a simple change in acceptance: acceptance that your feelings for your wife haven\u2019t changed and that your right to mourn her and hold her in your heart as you choose is sacrosanct to you. From now on, you need them not to push you into relationships, and you need that *especially* if they do ever hope to see you in one again, because pressure to move toward other relationships when you\u2019re not ready actively lowers the chances of you ever doing so. Be clear that if it comes up again, you will remind them once, and then you will just politely remove yourself from the conversation - or from the event - and give the person who is coming on too strong some distance for a while so they can reset to respecting this.\n\nThen let them have their feelings about it, and then - very simply - say this wasn\u2019t a discussion, it was information. You have *told* them how this is going to be from now on; you love their company, but nothing about your marriage and your life as a widower is up for debate or negotiation.

You can call this out. You can set yourself up to say \u201cremember when we discussed how I don\u2019t appreciate you telling me how to grieve? I\u2019m going to head home and we can talk in a few months when you\u2019ve spent some time recalling the proper way to behave about this, or sooner when you feel like apologising.\u201d Start pushing back.

Waaaaaa\"", "I whole heartedly agree with this! Too many people think that if someone isn't dating/married, that there is something wrong. That it's impossible for someone to be happy and fulfilling life without a partner.", "Please don't trivialize the slavery situation like that. They are not comparable.", "Why on earth would she suspect her friend lied to her about her friend's own brother? Why would she not 100% think he knew about it? It wasn't forward. She didn't jump in his lap or talk about marriage or something, she expressed excitement over an upcoming date.", "I always felt so awkward going on dates. That honestly sounds like something I would do in that situation, acknowledge the weirdness of it to try to get that out of the way.", "She probably thought OP knew about the date and was introducing herself as \u201cHi, I\u2019m (Name), I\u2019m the one your sister talked to you about, and I\u2019m excited to go in that date we both agreed to go on.\u201d\n\nShe had no idea that her friend had lied to her about arranging the date.", "Not having any romantic interest for 20 years is abnormal for someone who was previously in a loving marriage, however it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad or unhealthy. Sometimes people handle grief badly for very long periods of time, talking to someone could help them. Additionally a therapist can help people deal with people around them, this guy has been dealing with his friends and family trying to set him up for two decades, a therapist would, probably did, give him the tools to deal with this without hating himself or them.", "That\u2019s awesome, then that\u2019s all that matters. I hate how people value happiness based on romantic relationships.", "It\u2019s republicans who are trivializing slavery. And I\u2019m pointing out that there is never a time that \u201cmeaning well\u201d is anything but an excuse by terrible people to be terrible but pretend they have a good reason for it.", "OP's sister really is a massive AH. Can we all go and give both OP and Rejected Lady a hug?"]}
