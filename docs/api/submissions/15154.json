After three days, this previously unsocial cat became vocal and approachable with us (neighbours over the fence.)  As a cat friendly person, I was aware that my neighbours had left, was aware that the cat was outside 24-7. After day three, I checked the backyard of neighbours. Food and water available.. cat no longer had a collar. Day four: filthy water and no food. Day five: I left a note \u201cwe\u2019re concerned, phone #, please contact us, I\u2019m going to call animal services \u201c\u2026  fed the cat.  day 6 : no food, dirty water , so I pulled the plug, fed cat, called animal control and surrendered cat. He\u2019s **lovely** sweet, purring loving attention. Was very conflicted about sending him off to the pound, but I already have two female indoor cats that would **not** tolerate him. \n\nOwner returned this evening after 5 nights away, mad that we had surrendered their cat to animal control. I felt my actions came out of concern for an abandoned pet without necessities of life, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself. I felt 5 days was too long, but my neighbour is mad about the impoundment fee.and wants me to pay it, which I\u2019m willing to do. AITA?\n\n**EDIT**thank you all for your feed back.  I went for a long walk last night and mulled it over for myself. The shelter will charge $45 CAD for pickup and shelter fees. There\u2019s multiple cat bylaws in my city, including cat roaming and abandonment. \n\nI will wait and see if he has the nerve to try to bill me $45, or if he will have a change of heart and become a better pet owner.\n\n**E2**  [my cat tax as thanks for all the assertive advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bondedpairs/comments/mcosa7/these_are_the_two_that_started_the_sub_thank_you/).

They're irresponsible pet owners and the cat deserves better.", "NTA- They could have asked a neighbor to give it fresh food and water.", "NTA but a top human being.", "NTA.\n\nNeighbor was a jerk. Leaving a cat outside with no food or fresh water for days is a great way to lose a kitty. As long neighbors cat was not in danger of being put down, then you did the absolute right thing.", "NTA - and don\u2019t pay the fee.  What they did was poorly planned.  If they leave food outside wild animals will eat it.  They should have asked a neighbor to refill the bowls daily.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I do not like outdoor cats in any sense of the word, even those that *do* know that cats still need care. Even if the cat had been a barn cat/rodent control, your neighbours left it long enough for the cat to run out of food and water, *and* lose it's own collar. You attempted to leave your contact information, still nothing.\n\nOur pets rely on us. We are, functionally, their whole worlds. What would have happened if the cat had been unable to find water or food elsewhere? What would have happened if the cat had a run-in with another animal and became injured? What if there was a storm? Or some other kind of event that required special care? It would have died.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP.", "NTA. Un-neutered outside cat left for 5 days without regular food and water doesn't sound like a cared-for or loved family member. You didn't mention shelter, so I am assuming they didn't even have a safe space for him. Outside cats have relatively shorter life spans than indoor cats, especially if they are intact. I commend you on wanting to keep the peace, but this wasn't your fault. That poor cat deserves a family that really will love him.", "Nta, they should have someone taking care of the cat. At least now they know they can ask you to take care of the cat", "NTA - that\u2019s a poor helpless cat and they should not have left them there alone", "NTA at all! Who moves and just leaves their cat and comes back days for it later? An AH, that\u2019s who.", "NTA - they neglected and abandoned there cat for days. they should not be allowed to have any pets.", "I would have adopted that cat then and there tbh", "NTA. Who the hell leaves a cat with no water?! Even if you think the cat will catch wildlife, they still need access to water.\n\nI mean, I don't agree with outdoor cats, especially non-fixed ones, but if you're gonna leave, then you have to make sure the cat is provided for. You did the right thing. Don't pay those fees for those fools.", "Info: Did they move out and you thought they were leaving him for good, or did you think they'd come back for him?", "NTA. That should have got a pet sitter.", "Definitely NTA. You did the right thing and the owners are lucky an impoundment fee is all they have to pay because they should be charged with animal cruelty.", "I wouldn\u2019t give them a cent that\u2019s neglect they made the bed let them lie in it", "A soft YTA. You did it out of concern for the animal, but you could have just fed, watered and petted him until they came back. This is more like punishing them for it rather than caring for the cat.", "Info: was this a kill shelter? If so, YTA. There\u2019s many more options out there than that. I foster cats for a rescue and I get how awful it is to see irresponsible pet owners.", "ESH they should have checked up that the pet sitter was caring for the cat. I don\u2019t think you had ill intentions, but putting a cat in a shelter is always a dangerous move for the cat. Since it sounds like you can afford it easily I would pay to get the cat back. Their money might be pretty tight having just moved, especially since you commented that they were renting. You could maybe even go to the shelter and explain that it was your mistake because their cat sitter wasn\u2019t checking on him enough and you thought he had been abandoned. I\u2019m only ruling against you (partially) because six days is a pretty short amount of time to see the cat left and assume that it has been abandoned. \nWe adopted a momma cat that was dumped in our neighborhood with 8 kittens. We waited a month start finding homes for the kittens in case they had been stolen and dumped which has been a big problem in our area. Once she started to trust us it became obvious that she had been mistreated and we started making arrangements and decided to keep her. We\u2019ve had her almost 6 years now, but we made sure to give her a chance to return to her home or for her owners to come looking for her. In my area you have to wait at least 30 days to claim an animal you find, so I think you should have checked up on him for at least a couple of weeks. If he regularly went outside before he would have been fine unless there was a major storm and you could have sheltered him if one was forecast. I\u2019m just not okay with the risk of him being put to sleep at the shelter when they had been gone less than a week.", "YTA - it\u2019s their cat and you gave it away.", "NTA.", "NTA and don\u2019t you even think about paying the fee they abonded the cat with no food very little water that\u2019s animal abuse and neglect and how we\u2019re you to know if they were coming back in the first place", "NTA. Don't pay the fee. If the pet had no food and water left and was being outside without protection and an easy prey for wild animals then you did right by calling animal services.", "NTA, you're a good human helping a cat escape negligence. Don't pay for them to get the cat back, the cat deserves better humans", "NTA. Hopefully the pound will neuter him. You have a kind heart.", "I\u2019ve since talked with the pet owner and he\u2019s adamant that people were dropping by.  I came by multiple times and checked. No food. Changed the water myself and brought food.   I\u2019m not willing to argue this point with him as he\u2019s talking \u201ctrespass\u201d.   I just saw a needy cat. Raccoons eat everything around here.", "Thank you.  I\u2019ve been super conflicted over this and feeling pretty low.  Second guessing ones moral choices is hard.", "Honestly, you\u2019ve read my mind. I just can\u2019t vocalize it to the owners. This lovely little guy deserves so much more. But I think I\u2019ll just suck it up to keep peace", "That would be lovely., but with two immunosuppressant indoor females, I felt like we were at an impasse.   But a [void, a tortie](https://i.redd.it/0a586qvjhtma1.jpg)plus an orange tabby\u2026. Would have been great.", "I truly wasn\u2019t sure. They are transient renters, packed up their trailer and left. No activity in the yard for 5 days. They\u2019ve never been active pet owners, unneutered outdoor only cat,  I truly thought they might have abandoned him.   Hoped that they had not ( which they haven\u2019t). But it\u2019s really hard to explain that to folks that believe that unneutered cats should run freely outdoors.", "Giving the cat back to people who see no problem with animal neglect *is* punishing the cat", "And leave the cat with people who leaving it for a week with dirty water and no food is ok. Nope", "Believe me, I\u2019m totally second guessing my actions. My tunnel vision for cat superseded everything.  Thanks for the reality check. I want to interact with the family positively (and humbly) tomorrow", "No. Not a kill shelter.we don\u2019t have those. Owner returned this evening, will most likely get his cat tomorrow and I will pay the full bill to avoid neighborhood confrontation. Plus, cat is really sweet, even if he poops in my vegetable boxes. I like him a lot despite his crappy owners.", "I will be paying shelter fees\u2026 he\u2019s going home tomorrow. Thankful we don\u2019t have kill centres here. Also, thank you for taking in momma cat, her babies and making a safe space for her. \u2764\ufe0f", "Is your head screwed on right?", "But it wasn't their cat anymore, they abandoned it.", "Maybe he\u2019s technically correct, and he means you stopped by", "I was going to ask if you had raccoons. Not only will they take everything but they will protect that new resource and the cat will suffer bodily harm. Not to mention now raccoons are living very close by and they will tear through a wall find a cozy spot.", "Your overlords look gorgeous", "Yeah you are NTA. You can just abandon a pet for almost a week and hope they fend for themselves. Much less run freely outdoors not neutered.", "Agreed, the neighbors might be shitty people. They should have got a pet sitter. But at what point does it become OPs right to intervene? I love animals too but it's not your animal, and unfortunately you can't save them all :(", "Man just stop. Everyone is coming at me now like I did something wrong. Yes yes the people are shit, no arguments there. But it's not OPs job to police how neighbors take care of their pets.", "I disagree. The family intentionally left a cat behind with seriously insufficient water, food, or shelter. They are more angry with the cat being taken than concerned that their cat was at risk due to their clearly inadequate care. They are more pissed about the fee than upset the cat is gone. These are not responsible pet owners and the cat doesn\u2019t deserve to be neglected; this situation is unlikely to be a one off if they get the cat back. \n\nMy one concern is the cat being euthanized, which it doesn\u2019t deserve. But this sort of animal mistreatment is not ok and is usually illegal *because it\u2019s not ok*.\n\nNta you didn\u2019t do it out of spite, the cat needed help and you were unable to take the cat in. My guess is the shelter would likely waive the fee if a cat was mistakenly or vindictively surrendered without the consent of a loving pet owner. My guess is the pet owners are either unwilling to explain why the cat was surrendered (and how they put the cat in such risky conditions as a result in the surrender), or the pet owners told the shelter what they did and the shelter is refusing to waive the fee as a result.", "You did the right thing. If they think leaving it that long with no one to check it and clean it\u2019s water and feed it they shouldn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s neglect and cruelty. It clearly was in need as it was approaching for help. They are in the wrong here not you. They could have asked a neighbour to put clean water and food down but chose not too. That\u2019s the reality check they need.", "NTA.\n\nDid you know how long they would be gone?  Even if you knew they would be gone 5 days, their failure to have someone reliable to provide food and clean water for that length of time is cruel.  It was not  OK because they thought the neighbors could have fed it or other such B.S.", "Hey, you came here for advice because you think you made a mistake. You did, but at least you weren't ignorant enough to pretend you didn't so don't beat yourself up. If I were you I'd swallow my pride, pay the impound fee, apologise, and just explain that you love animals, were concerned, and didn't mean to cause offence.\n\nWhether they accept your apology or not is up to them, but that's all the damage control and rectifying you can do.", "In that case, NTA. You\u2019re not a mind reader. It\u2019s kind of you to pay the bill though I think it\u2019s unnecessary. Hopefully they freaking neuter they their cat!", "Will the shelter neuter the cat before returning him? I know of some that will charge a very high fee to release an intact animal back to the owner OR a very small fee if the shelter is allowed to sterilize it.", "haha no i don\u2019t have any screws in my head thank you though.", "they left and forgot their cat then came back. things happen but you can\u2019t steal peoples pets.", "Wait, are you saying it would\u2019ve been best to leave the cat to fend for itself? Op kept the cat safe, the neighbors just don\u2019t want to pay a fee to get it back! Most shelters would waive fees if the cat was vindictively surrendered or mistakenly surrendered when it had a loving home that could adequately provide for it. My guess is either the owners were unwilling to explain what happened to result in the cat being surrendered (and how their neglect resulted in the cat being put at risk), or they told the shelter and the shelter is unwilling to waive the fee because they realize that the owners were not taking care of the cat.", "But it wasn't their pet anymore, they abandoned it.", "I went for a long LONG walk after our confrontation with our neighbour tonight. I wasn\u2019t stable enough to deal with the situation at the time (all spiky adrenaline) so my very very calm husband took the brunt for me.    However. On my long walk of talking through it , I am ready to pay for impoundment fees, because it\u2019s just money, and well being is more important. I\u2019m willing to atone for due stress to that family, even though it may have come from good intent, I truly want to be a good neighbor.

They were just AH\u2018s who thought they could go away for five days and not make proper arrangements for their cat.", "I don't know how you came to that conclusion when I litreally said OP should have just fed watered and looked after the cat but not send it to a pound.", "I think you\u2019re more an AH for willingly helping them get the cat back when they\u2019re clearly appalling pet-owners. I understand you feel bad, but considering they neglect the cat even on a good day, and there are no kill-shelters in your area, removing the cat was the best idea.", "You don\u2019t need to make amends, you taking the blame here will make them think they were right. If they did have people who were supposed to check in then they need to take it up with them. But this isn\u2019t the first instance of you seeing them being neglectful of the cat. Your angst here shows you are a good person. They will take advantage of that to make you feel bad and that you\u2019re in the wrong.

They ended up coming back to pick up some stuff and didn't even ask for her back; just acted like she was an old toy and they were glad someone had a use for her.

It would be a huge asshole move to reunite them when now the cat has a chance to find an actual loving family from the pound.", "NTA.  And I would NOT pay a cent towards the kitty jail fees.\n\nStory time- I moved to a new neighborhood last year.  First thing I did was get security cams all over the house and yard.  I watched 2 neighborhood cats get splattered on our road- first died instantly, but the second did not and it was AWFUL.  I also got to watch the neighborhood foxes eat an opossum and attack 2 other cats, who survived.\n\nA few months in a 1/2 grown kitten started showing up at my house.  It repeatedly tried to get into my house.  It would climb up my window screens at all hours of the day and night, scaring the heck out of me, and wrecking my window screens.  I asked several neighbors if they knew who the cat belonged to, but nothing.  I grew to like the little cat, but meanwhile it was getting thinner and thinner, covered in fleas and ticks, and I cannot have cats as I am allergic.\n\nSo, I found a new home for it.  It was way too adorable and petite to be splattered on the road, eaten by the local wildlife, or left outside in the dead of winter.  It took 3 weeks for the missing cat signs to go up in the neighborhood.  I felt morally ambiguous about giving away someone's cat, but the lack of care and attention they paid to that animal was shameful.  And in that 3 weeks time that the cat was at its new home, she practically had doubled in size.\n\nI see her every now and again, and I am not at all sorry she has a home where she is warm, safe, well-fed, and a completely indoor pet.

You acted in the cat\u2019s welfare when your neighbours FAILED to do so. Leaving a cat alone for 6 days without adequate food and refreshed water is neglect.

But that was a life lesson to always have someone to check in on cats because you never know when they'll develop problems.", "Oh that's for sure lol. Had to switch from food out all day to a set feeding time, and oh boy does she know her feeding time \ud83e\udd23", "That depends on where you live, though. If you\u2019re by a major city, especially one that\u2019s surrounded by more rural areas, cats rarely get put down. They\u2019ll get adopted out as barn cats in the worst case scenario.", "I'm a cat person as well, and I used to be generally 50/50 on outdoor-cat ideology (not including barn-type cats who have the specific job of pest control). The main argument against it for me is life expectancy goes down like 10 years for outdoor cats, from disease, fights, and cars. What tipped the scales entirely was this exact point being brought to my attention. House cats that end up strays or feral are invasive and kill a lot of non-pest wildlife. \n\n(NTA, calling animal control after 6 days of clear evidence of abandonment and neglect is extremely reasonable)", "I was with you until you called raccoons rodents, lol.  Not even close.  \ud83d\ude02", "If a raccoon goes after a dog it is probably bc dogs will try to fight a raccoon. Dogs are way more territorial than cats, or rather, they have a different concept of territory than cats do.", "Honestly, the birds of prey we have here are much more worrisome. Eagles have been known to carry cats off to the nest. We live next to a stand of old growth trees so the cats do have that protection, however we have owls as well. \n\nYes, letting cats outside can be dangerous, but my cats have chosen that life. We have two cats that do not go out, but my female cats were raised in a barn before we got them and they insist on going outside.", "I didn't say I'm an expert but in my experience it's never been an issue. The cats and raccoons in question were/are very tame. \n\nWhere I live now it's somewhat rural, but the animals here coexist with humans and domesticated animals. \n\nI don't even see the raccoons here, but we do see the foxes bc they are so numerous. My husband has observed our cat playing with the foxes in our backyard.", "Or we just don't know what emergencies would require us to need to call a neighbor instead of family, friends, or 911?", "That's exactly it. I grew up with outdoor cats on the dairy. They hunted mice. I also grew up with housecats who went outside. They slaughtered birds and other native wildlife. I love cats so much, but invasive feral cats are the third largest cause of species going extinct, behind rats and, obviously, humans.", "Cats can be downright mean if they feel like their territory is being invaded especially if it's other animals. Dogs can too obviously", "You're the pet owner. If they're hurt, it's on you, not them.", "Socially it\u2019s different. Environmentally it\u2019s not, unfortunately.", "LMAO they\u2019re an invasive species in Europe too.  All domestic cats are descended from the North African / Southwest Asian wildcat.", "Why would you say no to someone checking on your cat? Even if it hates strangers, batteries can die and power can go out as far as the auto feeder. Plus no cleaning of the litter box for three days??", "What if you aren't home? Lol it's needed", "They are. It's just more socially acceptable so people make up all kinds of bs", "They do hunt birds and small mammals in Europe, but there were already wild cats before there were domestic ones, plus other small predators that fill a similar ecological niche. They haven't stormed in and torn apart the balance. They've also been present for a lot longer.", "Maybe I'm mistaken, but cats were brought to North America by European colonists, so they are definitely invasive to North America.  As far as Europe goes, I am not as knowledgeable, I figured that cats have been around in Europe much longer than North America and I know in the UK cats have the right to roam.", "Native species in areas the cats frequent have not gone down apparently, it's the farming practices and other removal of natural habitat that are killing the wildlife in Europe.", "Cat hates strangers. You don't think we have back ups and fail safes?\n\nShe has 3 sources of water, two for food and two litter boxes.\n\nEven if the bin is empty on the feeder, she still has dry food in the tray for days. \n\nWhy you riding my ass?", "I would never trust automatic feeders either. I would never use them if I were going to be away for long, although they are handy for morning feedings so you don't have to get up, or if you are late from work.", "They\u2019ve been invasive in Europe longer, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t invasive, lol.", "Because your house probably has doors.

They should have hired a pet sitter like any responsible pet owner.

But they really didn't care.", "Nta", "NTA. tell him to get lost", "NTA\n\nDo NOT pay that fee and set up that precedent. Neighbor sucks. This is how I ended up with almost 20 cats at one time, people abandoning their animals when they just can't be arsed anymore.", "Nta did you explain the situation to animal control. If you did they might not even give the cat back since I think it would count as abuse.", "The small town I live in is very aggressive in picking up cats roaming outside, collar or no collar.  It's very hard on the bird and small animal population around here and the cat population is exploding.  If they have a collar they check with the owner if they are able and the person can pay a fine and get the cat back.  No one should just let their cats run wild outdoors.  You are NTAH.", "NTA. That cat for all intents and purposes was abandoned. If the owner didn't want the cat at the pound he needed to have taken the cat with him to start with-or at the very least asked you or another neighbor to keep an eye out for him.", "Nta. So they thought it was okay if their previously indoor cat starved for several days until they felt like getting it? They're terrible people. I'd call the shelter and let them know they abandoned their cat", "I don't think anyone can fault you for caring about an animal. compassion is a very positive trait.", "Oh Hun. Absolutely NTA. And don't give him a dime. Abandoned his pet, didn't properly provide, and clearly hasn't had the kitty to a vet either. Next time get the kitty fixed and find it a new, indoor home", "NTA. Even if the neighbor had asked others to feed the cat, which is doubtful, an unneutered male cat should never be left outdoors alone. Tomcats are notorious for getting into nasty fights that can result in serious injury. They are also at high risk of contracting FIV. Their tendency to wander great distances in search of fertile female cats makes them more likely to get hit by cars. The neighbor was negligent for letting the cat outdoors at all, even before leaving town.", " You did great. \nThey\u2019re awful pet owners & shouldn\u2019t be allowed to own any pets.\nWell done for being kind and doing the right thing for the cat.\nDon\u2019t let your neighbours bully you or anything over this. Stand your ground. Your two cats are beautiful btw! \ud83d\ude0d", "Definitely NTA. they left the cat alone for days and basically .. neglected it. Sounds like the cat is better off without these people to be honest.

Your neighbor may have made arrangements and whoever was supposed to be taking care of the cat didnt do their job...you should have fed and water the cat..and then talked to your neighbor when they returned...if they didnt return in 10 days or so..then maybe call animal control...however...you live next to these people not me...so your in a better place to judge what kind of pet owners they are in general so take my yta with a grain of salt.", "YTA.  Sending the cat to the pound was your idea, and it doesn't solve anything for the cat, especially if we are talking about an outdoors neighborhood cat taken away from its environment.", "NTA. Leaving an animal without food for five days is horrible. They could have at least had a friend come by and check on the cat to ensure it had food, etc. The cat deserved better.", "Definitely NTA!!", "Update, apparently they *did* ask someone, but evidence says otherwise. Raccoons live in our area and rats.", "He\u2019s at a shelter (no kill policy) . And as of this morning, still on the website.", "I was in the same boat. I live in a Building complex with animal restrictions. New ppl moved in and they had this cute orange kitten that would get out. Our complex has ppl who don\u2019t pay attention when they drive, and this cat would dart in and out of traffic. I started feeding it and leaving water out for it. I had a cat that was not fixed at the time and we couldn\u2019t have another cat due to the restrictions. We started seeing that the cat had a shorter tail so after petting it and taking a look at it we noticed the tail was eaten off. That was the final straw for me. Both me and my neighbour decided to find a new home for the little guy. He\u2019s now fixed and has doubled in size and my neighbour told me her grandkids absolutely love the little guy. We ended up reporting the owners to the the local spca and the building managers. Turns out they had six animals over the restricted amount. 3 French bull dogs, 1 bird, 2 snakes, and 2 other cats. Not to mention the excessive amount of extra ppl living in the building. Everyone was shocked when the police and animal control showed up. We kept quite about the little guy.", "I acted upon the information I had at the time. I didn\u2019t know that they were returning that night.

I hope the shelter won't give him back unneutered!", "Same.  The longest I'll leave mine is 2 nights, and then I'm rushing back the next morning.

Five days is absolutely horrible. Definitely animal abuse, and they shouldn\u2019t get the cat back at all.
