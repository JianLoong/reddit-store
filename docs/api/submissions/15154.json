After three days, this previously unsocial cat became vocal and approachable with us (neighbours over the fence.)  As a cat friendly person, I was aware that my neighbours had left, was aware that the cat was outside 24-7. After day three, I checked the backyard of neighbours. Food and water available.. cat no longer had a collar. Day four: filthy water and no food. Day five: I left a note \u201cwe\u2019re concerned, phone #, please contact us, I\u2019m going to call animal services \u201c\u2026  fed the cat.  day 6 : no food, dirty water , so I pulled the plug, fed cat, called animal control and surrendered cat. He\u2019s **lovely** sweet, purring loving attention. Was very conflicted about sending him off to the pound, but I already have two female indoor cats that would **not** tolerate him. \n\nOwner returned this evening after 5 nights away, mad that we had surrendered their cat to animal control. I felt my actions came out of concern for an abandoned pet without necessities of life, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself. I felt 5 days was too long, but my neighbour is mad about the impoundment fee.and wants me to pay it, which I\u2019m willing to do.

If they wanted to keep the cat, they should've been responsible pet owners and provided care for their pet - like contacting you and asking you to feed the cat and check on him each day while they're away. They're irresponsible pet owners and the cat deserves better.", "NTA- They could have asked a neighbor to give it fresh food and water.", "NTA but a top human being.", "NTA.\n\nNeighbor was a jerk. Leaving a cat outside with no food or fresh water for days is a great way to lose a kitty. As long neighbors cat was not in danger of being put down, then you did the absolute right thing.", "NTA - and don\u2019t pay the fee.  What they did was poorly planned.  If they leave food outside wild animals will eat it.  They should have asked a neighbor to refill the bowls daily.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I do not like outdoor cats in any sense of the word, even those that *do* know that cats still need care. Even if the cat had been a barn cat/rodent control, your neighbours left it long enough for the cat to run out of food and water, *and* lose it's own collar. You attempted to leave your contact information, still nothing.\n\nOur pets rely on us. We are, functionally, their whole worlds. What would have happened if the cat had been unable to find water or food elsewhere? What would have happened if the cat had a run-in with another animal and became injured? What if there was a storm? Or some other kind of event that required special care? It would have died.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP.", "NTA. Un-neutered outside cat left for 5 days without regular food and water doesn't sound like a cared-for or loved family member. You didn't mention shelter, so I am assuming they didn't even have a safe space for him. Outside cats have relatively shorter life spans than indoor cats, especially if they are intact. I commend you on wanting to keep the peace, but this wasn't your fault. That poor cat deserves a family that really will love him.", "Nta, they should have someone taking care of the cat. At least now they know they can ask you to take care of the cat", "NTA - that\u2019s a poor helpless cat and they should not have left them there alone", "NTA at all! Who moves and just leaves their cat and comes back days for it later? An AH, that\u2019s who.", "NTA - they neglected and abandoned there cat for days. they should not be allowed to have any pets.", "I would have adopted that cat then and there tbh", "NTA. Who the hell leaves a cat with no water?! Even if you think the cat will catch wildlife, they still need access to water.\n\nI mean, I don't agree with outdoor cats, especially non-fixed ones, but if you're gonna leave, then you have to make sure the cat is provided for. You did the right thing. Don't pay those fees for those fools.", "Info: Did they move out and you thought they were leaving him for good, or did you think they'd come back for him?", "NTA. That should have got a pet sitter.", "Definitely NTA. You did the right thing and the owners are lucky an impoundment fee is all they have to pay because they should be charged with animal cruelty.", "I wouldn\u2019t give them a cent that\u2019s neglect they made the bed let them lie in it", "A soft YTA. You did it out of concern for the animal, but you could have just fed, watered and petted him until they came back. This is more like punishing them for it rather than caring for the cat.", "Info: was this a kill shelter? If so, YTA. There\u2019s many more options out there than that. I foster cats for a rescue and I get how awful it is to see irresponsible pet owners.", "ESH they should have checked up that the pet sitter was caring for the cat. I don\u2019t think you had ill intentions, but putting a cat in a shelter is always a dangerous move for the cat. Since it sounds like you can afford it easily I would pay to get the cat back. Their money might be pretty tight having just moved, especially since you commented that they were renting. You could maybe even go to the shelter and explain that it was your mistake because their cat sitter wasn\u2019t checking on him enough and you thought he had been abandoned. I\u2019m only ruling against you (partially) because six days is a pretty short amount of time to see the cat left and assume that it has been abandoned. \nWe adopted a momma cat that was dumped in our neighborhood with 8 kittens. We waited a month start finding homes for the kittens in case they had been stolen and dumped which has been a big problem in our area. Once she started to trust us it became obvious that she had been mistreated and we started making arrangements and decided to keep her. We\u2019ve had her almost 6 years now, but we made sure to give her a chance to return to her home or for her owners to come looking for her. In my area you have to wait at least 30 days to claim an animal you find, so I think you should have checked up on him for at least a couple of weeks. If he regularly went outside before he would have been fine unless there was a major storm and you could have sheltered him if one was forecast. I\u2019m just not okay with the risk of him being put to sleep at the shelter when they had been gone less than a week.", "YTA - it\u2019s their cat and you gave it away.", "NTA.", "NTA and don\u2019t you even think about paying the fee they abonded the cat with no food very little water that\u2019s animal abuse and neglect and how we\u2019re you to know if they were coming back in the first place", "NTA. Don't pay the fee. If the pet had no food and water left and was being outside without protection and an easy prey for wild animals then you did right by calling animal services.", "NTA, you're a good human helping a cat escape negligence. Don't pay for them to get the cat back, the cat deserves better humans", "NTA. Hopefully the pound will neuter him. You have a kind heart.", "I\u2019ve since talked with the pet owner and he\u2019s adamant that people were dropping by.  I came by multiple times and checked. No food. Changed the water myself and brought food.   I\u2019m not willing to argue this point with him as he\u2019s talking \u201ctrespass\u201d.   I just saw a needy cat. Raccoons eat everything around here.", "Thank you.  I\u2019ve been super conflicted over this and feeling pretty low.  Second guessing ones moral choices is hard.", "Honestly, you\u2019ve read my mind. I just can\u2019t vocalize it to the owners. This lovely little guy deserves so much more. But I think I\u2019ll just suck it up to keep peace", "That would be lovely., but with two immunosuppressant indoor females, I felt like we were at an impasse.   But a [void, a tortie](https://i.redd.it/0a586qvjhtma1.jpg)plus an orange tabby\u2026. Would have been great.", "I truly wasn\u2019t sure. They are transient renters, packed up their trailer and left. No activity in the yard for 5 days. They\u2019ve never been active pet owners, unneutered outdoor only cat,  I truly thought they might have abandoned him.   Hoped that they had not ( which they haven\u2019t). But it\u2019s really hard to explain that to folks that believe that unneutered cats should run freely outdoors.", "Giving the cat back to people who see no problem with animal neglect *is* punishing the cat", "And leave the cat with people who leaving it for a week with dirty water and no food is ok. Nope", "Believe me, I\u2019m totally second guessing my actions. My tunnel vision for cat superseded everything.  Thanks for the reality check. I want to interact with the family positively (and humbly) tomorrow", "No. Not a kill shelter.we don\u2019t have those. Owner returned this evening, will most likely get his cat tomorrow and I will pay the full bill to avoid neighborhood confrontation. Plus, cat is really sweet, even if he poops in my vegetable boxes. I like him a lot despite his crappy owners.", "I will be paying shelter fees\u2026 he\u2019s going home tomorrow. Thankful we don\u2019t have kill centres here. Also, thank you for taking in momma cat, her babies and making a safe space for her. \u2764\ufe0f", "Is your head screwed on right?", "But it wasn't their cat anymore, they abandoned it.", "Maybe he\u2019s technically correct, and he means you stopped by", "I was going to ask if you had raccoons. Not only will they take everything but they will protect that new resource and the cat will suffer bodily harm. Not to mention now raccoons are living very close by and they will tear through a wall find a cozy spot.", "Your overlords look gorgeous", "Yeah you are NTA. You can just abandon a pet for almost a week and hope they fend for themselves. Much less run freely outdoors not neutered.", "Agreed, the neighbors might be shitty people. They should have got a pet sitter. But at what point does it become OPs right to intervene? I love animals too but it's not your animal, and unfortunately you can't save them all :(", "Man just stop. Everyone is coming at me now like I did something wrong. Yes yes the people are shit, no arguments there. But it's not OPs job to police how neighbors take care of their pets.", "I disagree. The family intentionally left a cat behind with seriously insufficient water, food, or shelter. They are more angry with the cat being taken than concerned that their cat was at risk due to their clearly inadequate care. They are more pissed about the fee than upset the cat is gone. These are not responsible pet owners and the cat doesn\u2019t deserve to be neglected; this situation is unlikely to be a one off if they get the cat back. \n\nMy one concern is the cat being euthanized, which it doesn\u2019t deserve. But this sort of animal mistreatment is not ok and is usually illegal *because it\u2019s not ok*.\n\nNta you didn\u2019t do it out of spite, the cat needed help and you were unable to take the cat in. My guess is the shelter would likely waive the fee if a cat was mistakenly or vindictively surrendered without the consent of a loving pet owner. My guess is the pet owners are either unwilling to explain why the cat was surrendered (and how they put the cat in such risky conditions as a result in the surrender), or the pet owners told the shelter what they did and the shelter is refusing to waive the fee as a result.", "You did the right thing. If they think leaving it that long with no one to check it and clean it\u2019s water and feed it they shouldn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s neglect and cruelty. It clearly was in need as it was approaching for help. They are in the wrong here not you. They could have asked a neighbour to put clean water and food down but chose not too. That\u2019s the reality check they need.", "NTA.\n\nDid you know how long they would be gone?  Even if you knew they would be gone 5 days, their failure to have someone reliable to provide food and clean water for that length of time is cruel.  It was not  OK because they thought the neighbors could have fed it or other such B.S.", "Hey, you came here for advice because you think you made a mistake. You did, but at least you weren't ignorant enough to pretend you didn't so don't beat yourself up. If I were you I'd swallow my pride, pay the impound fee, apologise, and just explain that you love animals, were concerned, and didn't mean to cause offence.\n\nWhether they accept your apology or not is up to them, but that's all the damage control and rectifying you can do.", "In that case, NTA. You\u2019re not a mind reader. It\u2019s kind of you to pay the bill though I think it\u2019s unnecessary. Hopefully they freaking neuter they their cat!", "Will the shelter neuter the cat before returning him? I know of some that will charge a very high fee to release an intact animal back to the owner OR a very small fee if the shelter is allowed to sterilize it.", "haha no i don\u2019t have any screws in my head thank you though.", "they left and forgot their cat then came back. things happen but you can\u2019t steal peoples pets.", "Wait, are you saying it would\u2019ve been best to leave the cat to fend for itself? Op kept the cat safe, the neighbors just don\u2019t want to pay a fee to get it back! Most shelters would waive fees if the cat was vindictively surrendered or mistakenly surrendered when it had a loving home that could adequately provide for it. My guess is either the owners were unwilling to explain what happened to result in the cat being surrendered (and how their neglect resulted in the cat being put at risk), or they told the shelter and the shelter is unwilling to waive the fee because they realize that the owners were not taking care of the cat.", "But it wasn't their pet anymore, they abandoned it.", "I went for a long LONG walk after our confrontation with our neighbour tonight. I wasn\u2019t stable enough to deal with the situation at the time (all spiky adrenaline) so my very very calm husband took the brunt for me.    However. On my long walk of talking through it , I am ready to pay for impoundment fees, because it\u2019s just money, and well being is more important. I\u2019m willing to atone for due stress to that family, even though it may have come from good intent, I truly want to be a good neighbor. I\u2019ve overstepped in good conscience and have **no clue** how to make amends. (But I still feel like they are shitty pet owners that do not deserve a pet)", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Then they don\u2019t deserve to have that cat!", "You \"forget \" a bicycle or a lawnmower.  \nWhen it's a pet, it's called abandonment.  The cat was suffering and OP had no way of knowing when or if these people were returning.  How long do you think OP should have waited before making sure the cat was safe?", "They didn\u2019t forget their cat. No one forgets that they have a pet. And they left food and water, so, no, they didn\u2019t forget. They were just AH\u2018s who thought they could go away for five days and not make proper arrangements for their cat.", "I don't know how you came to that conclusion when I litreally said OP should have just fed watered and looked after the cat but not send it to a pound.", "I think you\u2019re more an AH for willingly helping them get the cat back when they\u2019re clearly appalling pet-owners. I understand you feel bad, but considering they neglect the cat even on a good day, and there are no kill-shelters in your area, removing the cat was the best idea.", "You don\u2019t need to make amends, you taking the blame here will make them think they were right. If they did have people who were supposed to check in then they need to take it up with them. But this isn\u2019t the first instance of you seeing them being neglectful of the cat. Your angst here shows you are a good person. They will take advantage of that to make you feel bad and that you\u2019re in the wrong. Youre not", "Truly I had no way of knowing how long, if ever, they would be back. There\u2019s bylaws in place in my city for any roaming cat to be surrendered."]}
