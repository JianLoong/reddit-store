After three days, this previously unsocial cat became vocal and approachable with us (neighbours over the fence.)  As a cat friendly person, I was aware that my neighbours had left, was aware that the cat was outside 24-7. After day three, I checked the backyard of neighbours. Food and water available.. cat no longer had a collar. Day four: filthy water and no food. Day five: I left a note \u201cwe\u2019re concerned, phone #, please contact us, I\u2019m going to call animal services \u201c\u2026  fed the cat.  day 6 : no food, dirty water , so I pulled the plug, fed cat, called animal control and surrendered cat. He\u2019s **lovely** sweet, purring loving attention. Was very conflicted about sending him off to the pound, but I already have two female indoor cats that would **not** tolerate him. \n\nOwner returned this evening after 5 nights away, mad that we had surrendered their cat to animal control. I felt my actions came out of concern for an abandoned pet without necessities of life, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself.

If they wanted to keep the cat, they should've been responsible pet owners and provided care for their pet - like contacting you and asking you to feed the cat and check on him each day while they're away. They're irresponsible pet owners and the cat deserves better.", "NTA- They could have asked a neighbor to give it fresh food and water.", "NTA but a top human being.", "NTA.\n\nNeighbor was a jerk. Leaving a cat outside with no food or fresh water for days is a great way to lose a kitty. As long neighbors cat was not in danger of being put down, then you did the absolute right thing.", "NTA - and don\u2019t pay the fee.  What they did was poorly planned.  If they leave food outside wild animals will eat it.  They should have asked a neighbor to refill the bowls daily.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I do not like outdoor cats in any sense of the word, even those that *do* know that cats still need care. Even if the cat had been a barn cat/rodent control, your neighbours left it long enough for the cat to run out of food and water, *and* lose it's own collar. You attempted to leave your contact information, still nothing.\n\nOur pets rely on us. We are, functionally, their whole worlds. What would have happened if the cat had been unable to find water or food elsewhere? What would have happened if the cat had a run-in with another animal and became injured? What if there was a storm? Or some other kind of event that required special care? It would have died.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP.", "NTA. Un-neutered outside cat left for 5 days without regular food and water doesn't sound like a cared-for or loved family member. You didn't mention shelter, so I am assuming they didn't even have a safe space for him. Outside cats have relatively shorter life spans than indoor cats, especially if they are intact. I commend you on wanting to keep the peace, but this wasn't your fault. That poor cat deserves a family that really will love him.", "Nta, they should have someone taking care of the cat. At least now they know they can ask you to take care of the cat", "NTA - that\u2019s a poor helpless cat and they should not have left them there alone", "NTA at all! Who moves and just leaves their cat and comes back days for it later? An AH, that\u2019s who.", "NTA - they neglected and abandoned there cat for days. they should not be allowed to have any pets.", "I would have adopted that cat then and there tbh", "NTA. Who the hell leaves a cat with no water?! Even if you think the cat will catch wildlife, they still need access to water.\n\nI mean, I don't agree with outdoor cats, especially non-fixed ones, but if you're gonna leave, then you have to make sure the cat is provided for. You did the right thing. Don't pay those fees for those fools.", "Info: Did they move out and you thought they were leaving him for good, or did you think they'd come back for him?", "NTA. That should have got a pet sitter.", "Definitely NTA. You did the right thing and the owners are lucky an impoundment fee is all they have to pay because they should be charged with animal cruelty.", "I wouldn\u2019t give them a cent that\u2019s neglect they made the bed let them lie in it", "A soft YTA. You did it out of concern for the animal, but you could have just fed, watered and petted him until they came back. This is more like punishing them for it rather than caring for the cat.", "Info: was this a kill shelter? If so, YTA. There\u2019s many more options out there than that. I foster cats for a rescue and I get how awful it is to see irresponsible pet owners.", "ESH they should have checked up that the pet sitter was caring for the cat. I don\u2019t think you had ill intentions, but putting a cat in a shelter is always a dangerous move for the cat. Since it sounds like you can afford it easily I would pay to get the cat back. Their money might be pretty tight having just moved, especially since you commented that they were renting. You could maybe even go to the shelter and explain that it was your mistake because their cat sitter wasn\u2019t checking on him enough and you thought he had been abandoned. I\u2019m only ruling against you (partially) because six days is a pretty short amount of time to see the cat left and assume that it has been abandoned. \nWe adopted a momma cat that was dumped in our neighborhood with 8 kittens. We waited a month start finding homes for the kittens in case they had been stolen and dumped which has been a big problem in our area. Once she started to trust us it became obvious that she had been mistreated and we started making arrangements and decided to keep her. We\u2019ve had her almost 6 years now, but we made sure to give her a chance to return to her home or for her owners to come looking for her. In my area you have to wait at least 30 days to claim an animal you find, so I think you should have checked up on him for at least a couple of weeks. If he regularly went outside before he would have been fine unless there was a major storm and you could have sheltered him if one was forecast. I\u2019m just not okay with the risk of him being put to sleep at the shelter when they had been gone less than a week.", "YTA - it\u2019s their cat and you gave it away.", "NTA.", "NTA and don\u2019t you even think about paying the fee they abonded the cat with no food very little water that\u2019s animal abuse and neglect and how we\u2019re you to know if they were coming back in the first place", "NTA. Don't pay the fee. If the pet had no food and water left and was being outside without protection and an easy prey for wild animals then you did right by calling animal services.", "NTA, you're a good human helping a cat escape negligence. Don't pay for them to get the cat back, the cat deserves better humans", "NTA. Hopefully the pound will neuter him. You have a kind heart.", "I\u2019ve since talked with the pet owner and he\u2019s adamant that people were dropping by.  I came by multiple times and checked. No food. Changed the water myself and brought food.   I\u2019m not willing to argue this point with him as he\u2019s talking \u201ctrespass\u201d.   I just saw a needy cat. Raccoons eat everything around here.", "Thank you.  I\u2019ve been super conflicted over this and feeling pretty low.  Second guessing ones moral choices is hard.", "Honestly, you\u2019ve read my mind. I just can\u2019t vocalize it to the owners. This lovely little guy deserves so much more. But I think I\u2019ll just suck it up to keep peace", "That would be lovely., but with two immunosuppressant indoor females, I felt like we were at an impasse.   But a [void, a tortie](https://i.redd.it/0a586qvjhtma1.jpg)plus an orange tabby\u2026. Would have been great.", "I truly wasn\u2019t sure. They are transient renters, packed up their trailer and left. No activity in the yard for 5 days. They\u2019ve never been active pet owners, unneutered outdoor only cat,  I truly thought they might have abandoned him.   Hoped that they had not ( which they haven\u2019t). But it\u2019s really hard to explain that to folks that believe that unneutered cats should run freely outdoors.", "Giving the cat back to people who see no problem with animal neglect *is* punishing the cat", "And leave the cat with people who leaving it for a week with dirty water and no food is ok. Nope", "Believe me, I\u2019m totally second guessing my actions. My tunnel vision for cat superseded everything.  Thanks for the reality check. I want to interact with the family positively (and humbly) tomorrow", "No. Not a kill shelter.we don\u2019t have those. Owner returned this evening, will most likely get his cat tomorrow and I will pay the full bill to avoid neighborhood confrontation. Plus, cat is really sweet, even if he poops in my vegetable boxes. I like him a lot despite his crappy owners.", "I will be paying shelter fees\u2026 he\u2019s going home tomorrow. Thankful we don\u2019t have kill centres here. Also, thank you for taking in momma cat, her babies and making a safe space for her. \u2764\ufe0f", "Is your head screwed on right?", "But it wasn't their cat anymore, they abandoned it.", "Maybe he\u2019s technically correct, and he means you stopped by", "I was going to ask if you had raccoons. Not only will they take everything but they will protect that new resource and the cat will suffer bodily harm. Not to mention now raccoons are living very close by and they will tear through a wall find a cozy spot.", "Your overlords look gorgeous", "Yeah you are NTA. You can just abandon a pet for almost a week and hope they fend for themselves. Much less run freely outdoors not neutered.", "Agreed, the neighbors might be shitty people. They should have got a pet sitter. But at what point does it become OPs right to intervene? I love animals too but it's not your animal, and unfortunately you can't save them all :(", "Man just stop. Everyone is coming at me now like I did something wrong. Yes yes the people are shit, no arguments there. But it's not OPs job to police how neighbors take care of their pets.", "I disagree. The family intentionally left a cat behind with seriously insufficient water, food, or shelter. They are more angry with the cat being taken than concerned that their cat was at risk due to their clearly inadequate care. They are more pissed about the fee than upset the cat is gone. These are not responsible pet owners and the cat doesn\u2019t deserve to be neglected; this situation is unlikely to be a one off if they get the cat back. \n\nMy one concern is the cat being euthanized, which it doesn\u2019t deserve. But this sort of animal mistreatment is not ok and is usually illegal *because it\u2019s not ok*.\n\nNta you didn\u2019t do it out of spite, the cat needed help and you were unable to take the cat in. My guess is the shelter would likely waive the fee if a cat was mistakenly or vindictively surrendered without the consent of a loving pet owner. My guess is the pet owners are either unwilling to explain why the cat was surrendered (and how they put the cat in such risky conditions as a result in the surrender), or the pet owners told the shelter what they did and the shelter is refusing to waive the fee as a result.", "You did the right thing. If they think leaving it that long with no one to check it and clean it\u2019s water and feed it they shouldn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s neglect and cruelty. It clearly was in need as it was approaching for help. They are in the wrong here not you. They could have asked a neighbour to put clean water and food down but chose not too. That\u2019s the reality check they need.", "NTA.\n\nDid you know how long they would be gone?  Even if you knew they would be gone 5 days, their failure to have someone reliable to provide food and clean water for that length of time is cruel.  It was not  OK because they thought the neighbors could have fed it or other such B.S.", "Hey, you came here for advice because you think you made a mistake. You did, but at least you weren't ignorant enough to pretend you didn't so don't beat yourself up. If I were you I'd swallow my pride, pay the impound fee, apologise, and just explain that you love animals, were concerned, and didn't mean to cause offence.\n\nWhether they accept your apology or not is up to them, but that's all the damage control and rectifying you can do.", "In that case, NTA. You\u2019re not a mind reader. It\u2019s kind of you to pay the bill though I think it\u2019s unnecessary. Hopefully they freaking neuter they their cat!", "Will the shelter neuter the cat before returning him? I know of some that will charge a very high fee to release an intact animal back to the owner OR a very small fee if the shelter is allowed to sterilize it.", "haha no i don\u2019t have any screws in my head thank you though.", "they left and forgot their cat then came back. things happen but you can\u2019t steal peoples pets.", "Wait, are you saying it would\u2019ve been best to leave the cat to fend for itself? Op kept the cat safe, the neighbors just don\u2019t want to pay a fee to get it back! Most shelters would waive fees if the cat was vindictively surrendered or mistakenly surrendered when it had a loving home that could adequately provide for it. My guess is either the owners were unwilling to explain what happened to result in the cat being surrendered (and how their neglect resulted in the cat being put at risk), or they told the shelter and the shelter is unwilling to waive the fee because they realize that the owners were not taking care of the cat.", "But it wasn't their pet anymore, they abandoned it.", "I went for a long LONG walk after our confrontation with our neighbour tonight. I wasn\u2019t stable enough to deal with the situation at the time (all spiky adrenaline) so my very very calm husband took the brunt for me.    However. On my long walk of talking through it , I am ready to pay for impoundment fees, because it\u2019s just money, and well being is more important. I\u2019m willing to atone for due stress to that family, even though it may have come from good intent, I truly want to be a good neighbor.

How long do you think OP should have waited before making sure the cat was safe?", "They didn\u2019t forget their cat. No one forgets that they have a pet. And they left food and water, so, no, they didn\u2019t forget. They were just AH\u2018s who thought they could go away for five days and not make proper arrangements for their cat.", "I don't know how you came to that conclusion when I litreally said OP should have just fed watered and looked after the cat but not send it to a pound.", "I think you\u2019re more an AH for willingly helping them get the cat back when they\u2019re clearly appalling pet-owners. I understand you feel bad, but considering they neglect the cat even on a good day, and there are no kill-shelters in your area, removing the cat was the best idea.", "You don\u2019t need to make amends, you taking the blame here will make them think they were right. If they did have people who were supposed to check in then they need to take it up with them. But this isn\u2019t the first instance of you seeing them being neglectful of the cat. Your angst here shows you are a good person. They will take advantage of that to make you feel bad and that you\u2019re in the wrong. Youre not", "Truly I had no way of knowing how long, if ever, they would be back. There\u2019s bylaws in place in my city for any roaming cat to be surrendered.", "NTA and definitely don't pay the fee. The neighbor shouldn't get the cat back at all imo. You did good in looking out for the cat", "You did the right thing", "NTA people need to stop thinking you can just leave a cat to fend for itself for days on end, they need as much care & attention as a dog.

Just exchange contacts so you could call them if something similar happens.", "NTA.

This pisses me off sooooo bad.\n\nMy mom used to manage some apartments and one day the groundskeeper went in and found a fucking kitten in there. She was about 8/9 weeks and they'd just abandoned her. So guess who got a new furry friend? Me, and it's been a beautiful *5 years with my lil sassy Cleo. They ended up coming back to pick up some stuff and didn't even ask for her back; just acted like she was an old toy and they were glad someone had a use for her.

Who packs up and moves away without taking their pets even if it's an outside cat. I'm sorry I have moved before I've never exclusively had an outside cat my cats have always been indoor outdoor cats but I would never ever ever move without my cat this person does not deserve to get their cat back do not pay and hopefully they can't afford it either so this cat can go to a loving home", "Not every neighbourhood communicates with eachother.

Horrible people.", "You have to tell him no one came, otherwise it will happen again.", "Your morals seem pretty spot on.

It's unfortunate for the owners but maybe they won't forget them next time.", "It's never wrong to help the helpless and voiceless. Your neighbor should be ashamed. You should not give them a penny. \n\nMy only issue is a lot of cats, most of them, are euthanized at the pound including \"no kill\" shelters.

It would be a huge asshole move to reunite them when now the cat has a chance to find an actual loving family from the pound.", "NTA.  And I would NOT pay a cent towards the kitty jail fees.\n\nStory time- I moved to a new neighborhood last year.  First thing I did was get security cams all over the house and yard.  I watched 2 neighborhood cats get splattered on our road- first died instantly, but the second did not and it was AWFUL.  I also got to watch the neighborhood foxes eat an opossum and attack 2 other cats, who survived.\n\nA few months in a 1/2 grown kitten started showing up at my house.  It repeatedly tried to get into my house.  It would climb up my window screens at all hours of the day and night, scaring the heck out of me, and wrecking my window screens.  I asked several neighbors if they knew who the cat belonged to, but nothing.  I grew to like the little cat, but meanwhile it was getting thinner and thinner, covered in fleas and ticks, and I cannot have cats as I am allergic.\n\nSo, I found a new home for it.  It was way too adorable and petite to be splattered on the road, eaten by the local wildlife, or left outside in the dead of winter.  It took 3 weeks for the missing cat signs to go up in the neighborhood.  I felt morally ambiguous about giving away someone's cat, but the lack of care and attention they paid to that animal was shameful.  And in that 3 weeks time that the cat was at its new home, she practically had doubled in size.\n\nI see her every now and again, and I am not at all sorry she has a home where she is warm, safe, well-fed, and a completely indoor pet.  She looks gorgeous now, her patchy hair is all filled in, and she is very happy.\n\nI would do it all over again.", "NTA, but you should understand that Animal Control is a death sentence to many animals.

They had even left him infested with fleas which ended up passing to my cat as well. I finally found a wonderful home for him with a family and very sweet children. Original owners came back two *hours* after they picked him up, after not responding for months on end to a single text or call, and accused me of kidnapping their cat and demanded to have the new owners' info.

You acted in the cat\u2019s welfare when your neighbours FAILED to do so. Leaving a cat alone for 6 days without adequate food and refreshed water is neglect.

If they did organise care as a pet owner if be beyond pissed that whoever was meant to be caring for my pet  didn't care for the pet like I'd ask and control was called, not the person who called animal control", "If people were dropping by they would\u2019ve seen your note.", "TBF, it could be a case of their arranged care for the cat not doing their job. But in that case, they should be grateful you looked after their cat when it was not being cared for, and they should be asking for the impoundment fee from whoever was supposed to stop by.", "He might have been let down but you did right by the cat if situation genuinely as you saw. Though do worry about kill shelters. I wouldn't pay the release fee. He should have arranged better care including shelter. Pound covered shelter, food and water for him.", "Don't pay ANY fees. You're NTA, tell the animal services or whoever comes to your door about how they abandoned the poor cat for days.", "That cat asked you for help. A cat who suddenly gets social and hangs out with you is asking for help. You helped him.\n\nMy neighbor did the same sort of thing. Had a gorgeous calico baby. Someone in the neighborhood took the cat and made her an indoor cat. Mom told the neighbor that they didn't deserve any of their pets, so she wasn't going to share who had her. Just that she was safe.\n\nMom can be a lot but she's definitely a badass.", "I'm going to get absolutely blasted for this, but I've left my cat for 5 days before. The difference is I kept him indoors, left plenty of water options, and more than enough food. The reason I didn't have someone check on him is because it terrifies him to have strangers in the house. Even knowing he had more than enough to get by, I still felt bad being gone so long. Now I have resources he is comfortable with, so he doesn't have to be alone while I'm gone.\n\nI would NEVER leave my cat outside alone for 5 days.", "By \"suck it up,\" I hope that doesn't mean that you're planning on reimbursing them for the fee!!", "OMG! I also have a black cat and a tortie! Love to see it", "So, the cat is going right back to the people that left it with zero care?", ">I will be paying shelter fees\n\nYTA to yourself for that\n\nThough the shelter is the bigger AH for giving them back the cat in the first place", "There should always be a way to communicate", "NTA - Negligent owners leave their cats without proper shelter food and water and then you want to pay for the seizure? Take care of yourself and don't involve others.", "If the pet has no food and water left and is outside without protection and is easy prey for wild animals, you should call animal services.", "Why? People who live in proximity to you don't need your number nor you theirs.\n\nIt ain't a commune it's a neighbourhood.", "I live less than 20 feet from my neighbors on either side and don't have their numbers. We've never had any interactions other than a brief hello.", "Why?", "How do you forget your cat? For 5 days?", "No. No no no. Don\u2019t help them get the cat back that they left to fend for itself for 5 days. Not good pet owners.", "Well it kinda is, neightboors can be really useful especially when you aren't home for days/weeks.", "I don't say you have to talk all the time or everyday but it's good to have a number in case of emergency.", "What why, wtf, some of you have issues here go look at them.", "Yes they can. But neighbourhoods don't NEED your number which is what you posited with neighbours MUST have each other's number.\n\nI most certainly wouldn't want my neighbours have my phone number myself, that's for friends and family and most neighbours are nothing more than people who live near me.", "I don\u2019t know! Maybe people don\u2019t think OP is an AH at all, or that regardless of the neglect the cat belongs to the neighbours?", "They need to have a number it's needed. In case of emergency.", "NTA. If they were going away for that long they should have put the cat in a boarding kennel or kept him inside with enough food and water to last five days. Leaving an unneutered cat outside is also irresponsible as they are contributing to the stray population and putting him at risk for engaging in cat fights where he could be injured.", "NTA. The cat was outside 24/7 with no way to get inside out of the elements and away from wild animals, and its food and clean water ran out. The owners were extremely negligent. You weren\u2019t wrong to surrender the cat because for all you knew, they\u2019d abandoned it and it needed a safe place with food and water. They can pay their own impounding fee to get the cat back. Hopefully they\u2019ve learned something from his experience.", "NTA Naaaaah tell them it is possibly cheaper than the animal hostel they should have payed in the first place.", "Leaving an unfixed cat outside for days? NTA they can pay impoundment and get their cat fixed you did right.", "You said you're willing to pay the fee which is more than reasonable.\n\nNTA.", "People will lash out and create any sort of false reality in their head to place blame somewhere else. You did exactly what any human would do. NTA", "Pay the impoundment fees.\n\nThey are ungrateful wretches", "NTA. If you do NOT pay that fee. You would be paying to let a cat go home to people who neglected it. You WBTA if you did that. You rescued that cat. Don't toss it right back in the deep end.", "NTA - If they can afford a vacation for themselves, they can afford to care for their cat. They chose not to.", "NTA. The neighbors do not love or care about that cat. He is better off with someone else. Thank you for caring for him. You\u2019re good people.", "NTA and do *NOT* give those people money! \n\nWhen we bought a house and started moving, first thing was the cat and her gear. We had lawn chairs and sleeping bags, so she could acclimate. \n\nBut then, I'm a weirdo. She's spayed, vaccinated, chipped and wears a collar with a tag. Usually, only two cats with collars. I've taken both to the vet. One belongs to a neighbor.\n\nRecently had a young male with a collar show up. No tag. He's been trying to come in for 2 weeks. I'm probably gonna surrender him to animal control because he's driving my older cat nuts and being a nuisance.", "NTA.  They can consider the fee your retroactive pet-sitting fee.  And let them know you are happy to go INSIDE and feed it next time they leave town for a week.", "NTA, they shouldnt have the cat tbh. They need fresh water and food.", "NTA, who tf leaves their cat ALONE for FIVE DAYS.", "Nta do not pay for fees either and I would call the local police station and ask them to meet you at the shelter to take your statement along with animal control/pound's statement about the incident. That should nip any trespassing threats in the butt. And next time neighbors threaten you with trespassing with that incident all you have to say is both I and animal control have given a detailed statement about that incident along with any pictures I had taken of the cats living conditions.", "OP NTA. Based on what you wrote, I would agree that it looked like the cat had been abandoned, since it didn't have sufficient food, water, or shelter. If the owners of the cat were just going on a vacation, they could have mentioned that to you or kept the cat inside their house.", "NTA they left him outside without food or water for days, reporting them was the only choice.", "OP did the right thing, the owners need to be charged with animal cruelty.\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to pay anything. If they didn\u2019t want to pay/ask a friend to check in on their cat, they could have bought a water fountain, a food dispenser, and a robot litter box. Yeah those are expensive but you CANT ABANDON YOUR PET for almost a WEEK!! They did nothing to ensure the cat was taken care of. It doesn\u2019t sound like they gave a single frick about the cat. Not okay. There are services like Wag where you can pay someone $20 to do a checkin on your cat. $20 each day would be less than the cost of the fountain, litter box, etc that I mentioned. There are many options they could have done. Fuck that person. Good person or not, they\u2019re a shitty pet owner.", "Also the fact that you left warning notes was very very kind and even further backs up your decision being the right one", "They had so many options if they couldn't take him; boarding, sitter, etc. \n\nThe jerks don't deserve a pet. \n\nNTA", "NTA. They abandoned him. Surrendering him to a shelter is far better than being abandoned.", "Do not pay the impound fee. They abandoned their cat!  Someone needed to be responsible for the well being of the animal", "NTA\n\nThey should have arranged care for it", "NTA.  You don't leave your \"pet\" alone for days with no fresh food and clean water.  If they had asked someone to watch out for the cat because they planned to come back it would be different.  At that point whoever was supposed to watch it would be TA, but this seems to be a case of straight-up neglect.", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t even pay the fee if I were you. This is just animal abuse and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated. Paying her fee is admitting that what you did was wrong, when in fact you went out of your way for the animals safety. Most people would just let that un-neutered cat escape and wreck havoc.", "Nta they should have found someone to care for their cat. Good of you for doing the right thing", "NTA", "You are a hero to that cat. Screw the humans who abandoned him and left him to fend for himself. NTA.", "NTA. Your goal was animal safety. Can't argue with that", "I did something similar about 12 years ago..my old neighbor had this beautiful long hair tabby cat that they\u2019d just let roam with no care for her. We had bears,dogs,probably coyotes too. My exs mom hates cats so I couldn\u2019t keep her which crushed me because she was the sweetest thing ever. My final straw was when she got stuck in a tall tree near my house for a couple days..I called 911 and they said they couldn\u2019t help so I literally baby talked the cat down,thankfully she trusted me enough to listen to me. After that I put her into a dog carrier with food and water and letting her out to go to potty for 5 days. So she has been gone for about a week and her \u201cowner\u201ddidn\u2019t even try looking for her. I took her to the humane society,where I\u2019m hoping she got adopted by someone who actually loved her and cared about her. So defiantly NTA,you saved his life most likely", "Plus the fact that he's an unneutered male left outside. effers. NTA OP", "Nope. Nope. Nope!\n\nCat goes *first* when moving!", "Relatively shorter? Outside cars average like 6 years and indoor cats 16.", "None of that is OP's responsibility. The owners should have gotten the cat neutered and put \"a lil doghouse\" outside for their OWN cat.", "AND do not pay the fee, FAFO", "NTA and I wouldn't pay any fees. They abandoned the cat. Whenever I moved, f*** everything else...my dogs went first. Or at least found a place for them while gathering everything for the move. They didn't bother with the cat and you were concerned and had every right to surrender to animal control. And if I was an animal control officer and they wanted the cat back I'd say nope you abandoned it once already OUTSIDE! UNEUTERED!! Irresponsible.", "I suppose it's possible that they had arranged for someone to come and it was that person being negligent.\n\nEither way they are mad at the wrong person.", "Maybe he had made arrangements and whoever was meant to be feeding the cat let him down. That's not your fault though.\n\nNTA", "If there's raccoons, there's probably possums, too. They'll eat cat food too.", "NTA.  Start talking \"Animal Abuse\" charges.  If the fee isn't too high it may be worth paying it as he will probably just let the poor thing be put down.  Perhaps you can pay them directly and get them to just tell him they \"waived it\".", "Possibly they did have people stopping by and you just didn't see them, but the raccoons got to what they put out before you or the cat did. That would also explain the dirty water, raccoons wash their food.\n\nStill NTA. They left their domesticated cat to fend for itself outside for a *week*. That's abuse even without everything else. Animal control wouldn't have taken the cat if they thought everything was fine.", "This simply is not true. Cats begin to have serious health issues if they don\u2019t eat for even 3 days. Google it!", "If you pay the fees, no lesson is going to be learned on your neighbor's end.", "Are you out of your fucking mind??\nWe are talking about a LIVING BEING here.\nThe cat isn't at fault and dependant on a human to littlerally stay alive. We are talking about a live and death situation here.\nThe fuck do you do when you see an injured animal lying on the street? Do you leave it there??\nI would never do that it's beyond fucked up.", "Also raccoons will drink the water AND THEN WASH THEIR HANDS IN IT!", "[removed]", "I mean we used to leave the cats outside when we went on two week family holidays. But they were indoor/outdoor cats, we built them a cozy nook in the shed with a cat flap, we live in a country where nothing eats cats, and someone from the village was always was paid to come *twice* a day to check water and to feed the beasts, plus the neighbours on both sides had their own pets and would also keep an eye out.", "I'm surprised animal control would give the cat back to them after they abandoned and neglected it, even with a fee (no matter who pays it). Yikes!", "How did you leave the food though? Unless you have an automated feeder you can't really leave \"more than enough\" food for a cat because firstly you never know when they might randomly decide to eat it all and then have to go without for days, and secondly dry food does go stale and cats are fussy creatures who may decide to turn their noses up at it.\n\nObviously you have other strategies now but if you ever find yourself without those again I'd recommend maybe setting up an in-home camera while you're away so you can see that he's actually still got food and water.", "And serious behavioral issues if their dish is empty for a few hours. \n\n- cat owner", "Monsters!", "Imo, death is better than neglect.", "Leaving a cat outside is also a death sentence for many animals, but calling animal control is at worst only going to end with the death of that one cat. And I have 4 cats that I treat like children.", "I read stories like the original one and get so upset. I don't believe that cats should live outdoors. But with cats there are such shades of acceptable. Like, I leave mine home alone for 5 days, but will have someone pop in once or twice to check her. And I also let her outside for about an hour a day... and I have barn cats, who are perfectly fine. Your story started out horrifying, but got better with each sentence!", "In North America, cats are pretty much an invasive species.  In Europe it's different.", "My mostly indoor cat is from a line of barn cats. She's 9 and prefers to stay inside. She likes our porch and goes out with us.\n\nShe has a fountain and an auto-feeder. She still gets mad if I leave for 3 days.\n\nTravel is stressful for her. Boarding is worse. Friend asked about checking on the cat, on our last trip. No thanks!", "Can you explain that? My understanding is that cats are killing off native species of birds and other wildlife all over Europe too."]}
