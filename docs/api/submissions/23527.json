For context, I (F) had a minor mouth surgery very recently. It wasn\u2019t anything crazy, but I did have to undergo anesthesia and have been dealing with some after effects. One of these is some pain, which is to be expected. The other is a lot of swelling on the side of my face where the surgery occurred. Also expected, but it is worse than what we thought it would be. I legitimately look unwell, and though I have had things to do in the days since the surgery, it has made me not want to leave the house. \n\nMy parents have been looking after me during this time period. My mother, knowing how embarrassed I am of my swollen face, decided to invite several of her friends over for a fun night, thinking it would help me feel better. I do appreciate and love these women, but a loud night genuinely has not been on my list of feeling better. I did voice that I wasn\u2019t interested in hanging out with anybody, but my opinion was overlooked and people came anyway. \n\nToday, my sister called to let us know that she hasn\u2019t been feeling well. She lives quite far from us. Admittedly, her issues are worse than my minor mouth surgery. I will not disclose what they are for privacy reasons, but I am fully capable of realizing this fact. After getting off the phone with my sister, my mother lets me know her friends are coming back over tonight and she expects me to \u201cmake an appearance\u201d and \u201centertain them for a while.\u201d I am now frustrated, as I had told her yesterday that I wasn\u2019t feeling up to a gathering. However, my swelling is even worse today, so I am even more embarrassed and unwilling to participate. I cannot stress how terrible I feel and how emotional I am at the moment. I voice this, and she tells me that she has too much to focus on with one child who is \u201cactually ill\u201d and doesn\u2019t have time for me to make a fuss.\n\nThis is where I may be TA. I began to cry and shout about how her friends aren\u2019t my responsibility and that I wished she could care for the child who is actually physically with her. She yelled back about how I\u2019m not actually sick for quite a while before giving up. We have not spoken since.\n\nSo, AITA for acting out?

It's not your responsibility to put on a show for your mother's friends, and it's perfectly okay to express your feelings about it.

Definitely not.", "You were stressed, hurting, and emotional and you shouted at your mother who has been ignoring your pleas and pushing things you've expressed you didn't want to participate in? \n\nNTA. One, your mother shouldn't be deciding a pain contest between her children when you and your sister currently both seem to have reasonable health issues. Two, she shouldn't be yelling at her own child who just had surgery and is recovering physically and emotionally from it.", "NTA.\n\nYou used your words and she ignored you. I'm sorry she was so dismissive and is insisting on centering herself.", "NTA I get mom is stressed out taking care of her adult babies, but her priority should be caretaking. Not making you more stressed out, which is causing the swelling to get worse. Under no circumstances do you have to entertain her friends. They are her friends, not yours, and beyond that, imagine how uncomfortable everyone would be? You are in pain, and these ladies are gonna be in discomfort because they feel like their making it worse.", "NTA...road to hell is paved with good intentions.

If your mom feels exhausted taking care of you, than she may just rest herself without any visitors or relax with her friends and entertain them herself. I don't get why you should disregard your pain and embarrassment, leave your room and entertain someone else's guests. So, leave alone your sister's illness - since you don't need 24/7 care, your mom can just go there to take care of her, but inviting guests and partying with request to get downstairs and entertain them does not seem logical for me.
