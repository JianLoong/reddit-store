I've been with my partner for a few years now, and we've been through a lot together. I have made several sacrifices for the sake of our relationship, including moving to three different states to support her career.\n\nIn the beginning, I had a different career path in mind and was working as a dental assistant while pursuing my dream of becoming a dentist. However, my partner wanted me to be closer to her and expressed her desire for me to focus on a different career. I made the difficult decision to change course and became a server, which provided a better income for both of us. Although I made this decision willingly, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed both emotionally and financially, and I'm uncertain about what steps to take.\n\nWhile I am currently making enough money to cover my own expenses, my partner is now making more money than me. However, I still feel that the financial burden is not being evenly distributed and it is causing me stress. I have been the primary support in the past, and I'm starting to feel unappreciated and taken for granted.\n\nFurthermore, I have been helping my partner with her work-related tasks, including handling her emails and assisting her with workplace issues. Although I initially wanted to be supportive, I'm starting to feel that my efforts are not being acknowledged or valued. I recently expressed my concerns and requested some form of compensation, not necessarily financial, but rather wanting to be treated with respect and appreciation. However, her response was not as understanding as I had hoped.\n\nRecently, this morning  we had a significant argument regarding my occasional usage of a weed pen. While I have significantly reduced my usage and only spend around $60 per month on it, my partner became upset and threatened to contact my workplace, accusing me of hiding additional money. This situation has left me feeling trapped and uncertain about the best way to handle it.  Is this retaliation of how I felt last night? She said she had a bad dream and causing her to act this way ...I also have a trip to California coming next week to visit my family she's sperated me from for three years as they don't like her but she has made the effort to cause drift. I'm scared of my positions \n\nGiven my personal history and past experiences, it's sometimes challenging for me to recognize my own worth. I'm starting to question if my partner's behavior falls into narcissistic patterns, but I still care deeply for her and want to work things out. I'm hoping to receive some advice on how to address these concerns and improve our relationship, especially given that my financial situation is currently intertwined with hers.\n\nI genuinely appreciate any insights, suggestions, or support that you can offer. Thank you for taking the time to read and assist me in navigating this challenging situation. (This is a right draft of our relationship thus far without many details)", "Hey, no need to be panicked. You are just helping. Your girlfriend has the issue. You have no NDA with that company. But you have the joker card. Your GF did something really stupid. Save the messages.

Nothing against servers, but you would have made far more as a dentist. You made the decision willingly, but it sounds like it was her idea. \n\nYou began doing your wife\u2019s work in addition to your own. I guess you don\u2019t see it this way, but that\u2019s super weird. And she takes it for granted and volunteers more work for you to do? \n\nShe threatened to contact your work and tell them about your use of a vape pen and is accusing you of hiding money, after you refused to continue doing her work for her. That\u2019s blackmail. \n\nYou say she\u2019s separated you from your family. Huge huge red flag there. If she doesn\u2019t get along with them that shouldn\u2019t prevent you from seeing them. \n\nI hope this thread is a wake up call for you. Your partner is abusing you and attempting to control you through your finances and by separating you from your support systems, so you will be fully dependent on her. When you don\u2019t give in to her demands (do her work for her) she threatens your job and tries to manipulate you. This is not a good person who cares about you. This is someone who is trying to use and control you. I know you care about her, but this isn\u2019t a relationship that\u2019s worth salvaging and things will only get worse as time goes on. \n\nYou need to make plans to get out, without letting her know what you\u2019re planning so she doesn\u2019t have an opportunity to retaliate. Go to see your family no matter what, and maybe let them know what\u2019s going on and see what they could do to help. Start separating your finances. You aren\u2019t married (I\u2019m assuming) and there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t each have your own bank accounts and split expenses evenly. Refuse to do any more of her work under any circumstances. Blame it all on your increasing responsibilities with your job.

MASSIVELY abused. Physically, psychologically, emotionally \u2014 she\u2019s checking all the boxes. She\u2019s isolated you from your family/support network. Please, please realize that you are in danger.\n\nYour wife is not a good person. Do whatever is necessary to get out. Look for women\u2019s shelters, county mental health sources \u2014 anything that can give you a lifeline out of there. You may have to throw yourself on your family\u2019s mercy for help, but that\u2019s what family is for.\n\nI\u2019m sending all good thoughts your way.
