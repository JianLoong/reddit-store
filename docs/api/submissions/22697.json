Don\u2019t even have the conversation again it\u2019s ridiculous.", "ESH you should never have started doing this in the first place.

Just stop writing the emails immediately.", "NTA, but you are now in a pickle cause you started it to begin with and now her job is kinda dependent on you, or least being in her boss\u2019s good favor.

The other issues aside, I\u2019d be pissed if my spouse asked me to pay them for doing a favor. Now, they should offer some show of appreciation for sure, but your partner isn\u2019t meant to be a customer either. Seems like they need to sit down and reset the nature of their relationship before it spirals into resentment and transactions.", "When I say compensation I don't mean money necessarily mean money  guess I used the wrong word I guess I suppose her treating me with human decency is what I'm getting at", "If she\u2019s not treating you decently, why are you with her? There\u2019s a power dynamic here that is NOT healthy for you, OP. The situation was going to bite her in the ass at some point, and it sounds like she\u2019s the type to shift the bite to your ass just because.\n\nTime for some serious thinking. At the moment, she definitely doesn\u2019t see you as an equal. Only you can make the determination whether she\u2019ll continue to take advantage of you as she is currently. Maybe you need to step out of her shadow and let the sun shine on you.", "I don\u2019t know what your wife does but in my job that would be a massive data security and explicitly in breach of my employment policies. I doubt the wife\u2019s manager would be praising her if they knew that essentially any email correspondence may have been at least seen if not written by a third party with no contractual relationship to the company.\n\nThis was a bad idea and you shouldn\u2019t have let it get to this point, but now is the time to cut it off and stop being so enmeshed in her job. NTA.", "INFO: How are chores divided at home?\n\nIf \n\na) she's doing all the cooking and cleaning and shopping and all you have to do is write some e-mails to help her out then Y T A.

I expressed my disappointment and frustration, questioning whether she views me as merely a tool for her benefit.\n\nI am tempted to call you TA because of this. It is not natural to lose your temper with your spouse over something that could easily be calmly discussed. From your post it sounds like you never brought up any issues with her until the moment you exploded. That is 100% on you.", "NTA. However, depending on the nature of the work you may become privy to personally or commercially confidential information that you shouldn\u2019t be. That is why asking family to help with work emails is always a dubious practice.", "NTA...except to yourself for starting to help her in the first place. She is a grown ass adult with a job and should be able to write her own emails. If she isn't confident in her writing abilities, she can buy the Premium Granmarly or take a business writing course (your local college probably offers one or she can find an online school that does).", "NTA - You gave your wife an inch, and she took a mile, by offloading all her work onto you. It's ok to help sometimes, but it is not OK to do all the work while your wife takes all the credit for it.\n\nI sometimes help my fianc\u00e9e with her work, but it's only basic things in MS Office and I don't know anything in her field of work.", "NTA, but does this post read just like an over-edited work email to anyone else?", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you can teach her how to write better emails though?", "Totally agree. I helped my other half with job applications because it would benefit the household if more money was coming in. I stopped helping when I realised it was a lazy factor, rather than ineptitude, stopping them doing their own apps. (They are super time consuming and we work in similar fields)", "Wife is clearly the kind of person who asks for an inch and takes a mile.

Wife stands on own two feet, and if that results in consequences at work, so be it, that's entirely on wife.", ">She's not a farking colleague trying to take credit for your work...\n\nNo, she's just a woman taking his assistance for granted despite the fact that it's interfering with his own life.", "I wound up working with my husband with his bookkeeping but at least he pays me lol I got a good wage and advance payments when I need it lol", "NTA If this has been going on for 3 years idk why she hasn\u2019t learned some email writing skills in that time, my husband helped edit and make my papers better for school for a year and by the end of the year he barely had to edit since I payed attention to what he was adjusting. If she is not willing to improve or learn after all this time that seems like her problem", "NTA - she has to do her own job.", "Yea half I was serious and the other I'm having a mental break down so thanks for noticing my over edits my post was deleted so many times so rules here but it finally posted", "They are both women", "Tell her to use ChatGPT.", "NTA. She should not offer up Your work and time without asking you first.\n\nBut more importantly: she should be doing Her job herself. \n\nBy presenting your work as hers she is misrepresenting her skills to her work place. Plus it\u2019s Very likely highly illegal for her to be sharing her work emails with you.", "NTA, but why are all these adults needing regular email revisions? Are they incapable of stringing together a few sentences?", "How incompetent is her boss that he needs someone to proof read and fix his emails?", "NTA", "NTA, but at this point, your options are to continue and feel abused or stop and face full resentment from her at her loss of status. Both will destroy your marriage.", "I mean...what? Does she work from home and only respond to emails when you are there? How is this situation occurring? \n\nWhat workplace would allow a stranger to read, understand, and respond to privileged emails? I'm guessing none. \n\nJust....what? Is this fake? \n\nESH. Stop writing her emails.\n\nPs. The line you \"crossed\" was the first time you helped. Now you want recognition? Geez.", "NTA. Might want to reflect on how else the boundaries, division of labor, and communication in this relationship are(n't) working for you. Good luck.", "I think this whole thing is just...structured wrong. \n\nInstead of writing the emails, why didn't you teach your wife how to write effective professional emails herself? If you want me to fish for you once, great. If you want me to go fish for you every day, I'm going to give you a rod and a lesson instead. \n\nI don't know what your reception would be to it, but people make BANK consulting on professional communications. Your wife, instead of claiming your skills as her own, could be putting you on for your first gig teaching her entire company how to not write like idiots.", "You say you were doing this for her when you both were still single.\n\nIs it possible that she married you just to get control of your abilities?\n\nIn any case, habitually exploiting you as a resource is extremely not good. And if it is what keeps you two together, maybe you should split.", "Nta but it needs to stop. You're very effective at communication  in these  emails.
