He's been with his girlfriend (18F) for \u22483 years now, and he asked about her moving in with us. I eventually said yes, and shes now lived with us for around 8-9 months.\n\nFor context, we live in a pretty big house with 2 kitchens, 2 bathrooms, and 4 bedrooms. There's an upstairs area where I sleep and have my own kitchen and the master bathroom. Downstairs they have their own space, and only need to come up to my area for showers. There are no issues with space and I still have my privacy, so I didn't see much of a problem. \n\nBut since she's moved in I've felt taken advantage of. \n\nShe has no job, and lost the one she *did* have almost immediately after moving in. She used to work full time but quit. \n\nWhen she first started living with me she paid a $80/month \"rent\" fee, mostly to help with utilities, and her and my son bought their own food. But now that she's lost her job, they're eating a lot of my food I buy for myself, and I'm only getting about $30 a month from my son who works part time. \n\nSo I'm left paying for almost all of their food, water, heat, etc. I was fine with this for a little while between jobs, but it's gone on for 8 months now and I don't even think she's applying anymore. \n\nThey're also very loud and inconsiderate. I sleep early, it's how I am, like 8 or 9 PM. I like to wake up a couple hours before work and enjoy the morning. And my son was always super quiet and respectful, until she moved in...\n\nNow they'll talk loudly until 12-3AM, and play music all throughout the day. I've even heard them have sex a couple times which feels so wrong since I'm his MOM. \n\nI've been unable to fall asleep until midnight on most nights. I work at 8:30 so now I'm either rushing to get out the door or losing sleep. \n\nI've told them to keep it down so many times but I feel like a nag because they don't listen and always just say \"we are\" or \"yeah wait a sec\" etc. They're completely dismissive of my needs or sleep schedule. They just don't care. Her attitude has annoyed me, because she seems to not take me seriously. I've heard her call me names behind my back multiple times. \n\nWell a month-ish ago I gave her an ultimatum. I told her if she didn't get a job and they didn't keep the noise down then she'd have to leave. She had until the end of the month (January.)  \n\nObviously Jan is over now. And I stuck to my word. I kicked her out on February 12, and she moved back in with her sister today (where she lived before moving in here, her parents are neglectful.) \n\nMy son is so mad at me. He said I'm \"heartless\" and need to give her a chance. Then basically stormed in his room and hasn't spoken to me since. I've tried texting him and explaining my side but I'm left on read.\n\nI don't want to ruin the relationship I have with my son. But the noise, disrespect, lack of job or trying, eating my food, money it cost me, it all ads up...\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676373369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1122y1q/aita_for_kicking_my_sons_girlfriend_out_of_the/", "score": 448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did give her a chance. You told her unless she got a job and kept the noise down, she was out.  That was the chance.  Your son wanted you to give her endless chances with No consequences.\n\nYour son is being unfair.  If they want to live together they can get jobs and find their own place, like all the rest of us.", "You have allowed BOTH of them to disrespect you for too long. You should have been very firm and negotiated boundaries AND implemented them immediately. They felt that you were a pushover and could be manipulated. Best to learn from this, and make sure you define and enforce boundaries with your son. This will ensure that you get respect in the long run. Not doing this would make you an ah to yourself. NTA for now.", "NTA, it's your house, they need to follow your rules. In my opinion, you should have kicked your son out too, but it's your life.\n\nGood for you for sticking to your word, I'm sure it wasn't easy.", "NTA you asked repeatedly for improvements to be made and they were ignored. Her calling you names in your own home is completely disrespectful and it\u2019s also disrespectful that your son did not challenge her or check her on it. I don\u2019t think you owe any further apology to your son. You drew the line and now stick to it.", "NTA \nShe could have easily found a job in 8 months it might not have been a job in her field but something to bring in cash, you told them multiple times to be quieter and were ignored. It\u2019s not like she had nowhere to go if she is back at her sisters, it sounds like she is a freeloader who had plenty of warning, as for your son if he doesn\u2019t like it he can get a full time job and move out.", "NTA...this is also your son's fault. If he wishes to stay, he also needs to start showing you some respect.", "NTA - if she wants to live in your house she needs to abide by your very reasonable rules.", "NTA. It sounds as though you have been nothing but considerate and fair for the time she\u2019s stayed in YOUR home! \nIf she had attempted looking for a job etc, then potentially I\u2019d have given a little more time but it seems likely they were enjoying the free ride a little too much.", "Did not finish reading. No need to finish reading. NTA.  You should kick both of them out.", "NTA. You were being taken advantage of by both of them. On top of that, they\u2019re both highly inconsiderate. They want to live together then they can both get full time jobs, move into their own place, and pay their own bills. It\u2019s called adulting and I think both your son and his girlfriend need to start.", "NTA. You said she quit her job shortly after she moved in. Very suspicious IMO.\n\nAlso, you gave her A MONTH to find a job. Plenty of time and the rent of 80 a/m is also very reasonable.   \nThey rent from you basically and with that come certain terms.   \nYour son needs to see that as well.", "NTA. You were providing accommodations to two adults who should have been grateful for your help and should have been doing everything to make themselves less of a burden. Considering gf quit her job shortly after she moved into your home, she needed this wake-up call to realize she was being selfish. If you want to support your adult son, that's your choice, but I'd be asking him to get a full-time job if he's not in school so he's not a financial drain and isn't eating the food you buy.", "NTA. This is YOUR house. You pay the bills, you pay for food and should not have to feel like a visitor in your own home. If your son and girlfriend could not live considerately with you and the girlfriend could not even bother to get a job and pay towards some of the bills and food, then she needs t go back to where she came from. \n\nIf they want to live together so much, let them move out together and see to their own bills, make as much noise as they like and have loud sex. Then it's not your problem. But while living with you, they needed to show respect and consideration, which they were unwilling to do.", "NTA. $80 a month for safe and secure housing is frankly a wonderful deal. She's a young idiot, as is your son.\n\nIf she gets a job, even part time, I'd say let her back and give her one last chance, providing she pays. And your son as well, if he's working part time he can afford more than 30", "NTA. Your son is no prize either.   Also for him to say \u2018give her a chance\u2019 \u20268 months was a pretty long one.  Stick to your guns.   He is likely to act like he\u2019ll forgive you if she can move back in.  Don\u2019t let him manipulate you more than he already has\u2026.and realize he already has and is with the silent treatment too on top of the disrespectful shenanigans", "NTA. You set boundaries in your house and she couldn\u2019t follow the rules. Not to mention she was living there FOR FREE.  You should also encourage your son to move out too. \n\nIf he wants to be independent and live his life then let him.   In an apartment.", "NTA\n\nShe basically uses you as a free hotel. \n\nIt shouldn\u2018t be too hard for her to find a little part time job like in a coffee shop and if she really has trouble doing so she could at least make sure to work around the house, e.g. help more with cleaning and so on to make up for the utilities and the food she takes that you\u2018ve paid for.\n\nFurthermore they should respect your boundaries and you shouldn\u2018t have to tell them all the time not to play loud music past midnight.\n\nMaybe she gets more humble after one or two months with her sister and you can give her one last chance to move back in once she found a job again. \nMake them sign a contract about house rules then. That\u2018s what real life is like. They\u2018d be trouble with a landlord as well if they don\u2018t keep it down at night.", "NTA.  You were hosting two adults who were not contributing adequately to their own living expenses.  They were inconsiderate and dismissive of your needs. And they were taking advantage of you. And it sounds like your son is still doing so.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t end up pregnant. She needs a plan to get some sort of job/education. Is your son going to school? They both sound like free-loaders.", "NTA", "NTA. You made a fair deal and she didn\u2019t keep her part.", "NTA, but I hope your son is either in school or doing something which explains why he is 19 and only working part time and giving you 30 dollars a month. He's old enough to be contributing financially and otherwise (cleaning, cooking etc).", "You're NTA. She was a rude, entitled guest. Your son should be on notice that he is next if he doesn't get his act together", "NTA. It sounds like you tried talk things through and they completely disrespected you and your boundaries. If someone utterly refuses to work with you and find a way to respect each other's needs in your own home, you're right to put your foot down.", "NTA. You are not her mother. You are not obligated to care for her in any way, she\u2019s taking advantage of you by staying with you and not paying rent - which is completely unacceptable.

They both had a great thing going with your excessively generous terms and decided to take advantage of that. Good for you standing your ground.", "NTA. You're way nicer than me, I would have kicked her out sooner. I hope you get some good sleeps now!", "NTA\n\nWrite your son a letter, just like the post above", "You need to kick your son out. You are not helping him by letting him mooch off you, treat you disrespectfully & act like a 5 year old. He won\u2019t be homeless if he gets a job. Your relationship is already destroyed because he is using you.", "NTA.  You DID give her a chance - 8-9 months worth of a chance.  Your son is acting completely entitled, spoiled and immature. He would also have a deadline on getting his act together or he can join his GF in living elsewhere.", "NTA.  You set down rules when she moved in.  The rules were no longer being followed, & yes they are taking advantage of you.   Get a job or get out!", "NTA. You told her what it would take for her to stay. Get a job and be courteous are not unreasonable expectations. She chose not to follow those 2 simple rules, so she's out.\n\nI'm sure your son is angry, but maybe he needs to understand that if he wasn't worth doing these 2 things to stay living together with, then maybe she's not worth staying together with.", "NTA.  You gave her plenty of chances and she abused your generosity.", "NTA - If your son doesn't understand the boundaries, he should go too.", "NTA kick him out too. It\u2019s time he grew up and realized just how good he has it and how kind giving and helpful you\u2019ve been", "NTA\n\nIf your son doesn't like your rules, he can also move out.   He is plenty old enough.\n\nWhen my son still lived with us, he had perfectly reasonable rules and he lived by them.  \n\nNow that he is out of the house, he has roommates.  They have perfectly reasonable rules for all of them, and all of them live by those rules.\n\nWhich include - paying for yourself, paying for your food and being respectful of the sleeping times of others.", "No", "I don't know. Did you all this time raise such an inconsiderate son or was this a personality change a recent one (about 3 years)? In any case you were not just feeling that you were being taken advantage of, you *were* being taken advantage of. \nYou took his girlfriend in our of the kindness of your heart. There is no requirement at all for you to do so. Why should she live at your house? What do you get out of it? Because your son will hate you for kicking her out? What kind of relationship with your son is that? \n\nNTA", "No.", "NTA.  You gave them both chances.  You came to an end and now the gravy train has left the station.", "NTA.....Honestly, I would've had her leave a long time ago. My son's gf, ( she was 26 and he was 22 at the time but she's now ex gf thank GOD) did the same thing....only when I put my foot down, she talked him into moving to CT with HER mother (we live in FL) and they left on,  you guessed it..... Mother's Day. This is my youngest son...the baby....and it hurt like hell. I was alone for the first time in 22 years. I had tried to tell him she was systematically removing him from everything he'd ever known. He wasn't allowed to go to his friend's house except once a month for 2 hours....couldn't play his Xbox (we're big gamers in this house) when he was at work, she'd constantly text him accusing him of cheating b/c he wasn't with her. but she refused to keep a job and she expected him to pay HER bills. He didn't see it...because he was thinking with the wrong head. He was an adult, he wanted to live his life HIS way....\n\n So they left. I let them. He was back in 3 months. Her mother is a drunk, can't hold a job and just as mentally unhinged as her daughter. It was the hardest thing I've had to do, but I had to. \n\nIt will be ok. He will see, in time, the truth of the situation and his next girlfriend will be a lot nicer, and more mature.", "NTA. You gave her many chances and fair warning. Still, I gave to ask, why all the blame on her? Your son equally participated in all the bad behavior too.", "NTA.\n\nThey sound like choosy beggars to me.", "NTA-you gave her a chance, she blew that one. I don\u2019t believe in 2nd chances. If you\u2019re son is unhappy, he can move out and get a place with his girlfriend.", "All of this, but realistically most relationships in this age end anyway...they don't know how to be adults by themselves, let alone with each other...they've been banking on you taking care of them because it didn't force them to grow-up. I'm not suggesting you should also kick your son out, but I'd put a lot more on his shoulders - make him pay for his own food again, or for \"rent\", or utilities he uses. He needs to realize that he's woefully inept at taking care of himself so that he's forced to grow up a bit.\n\nThe side-effect of that being that he'll probably realize how immature his gf is, as well...so either she'll end up being forced to grow up along with him or he'll realize she's not ready for an adult relationship.", "NTA. OP, stop apologizing to your son. You have nothing to apologize for. He should be apologizing to YOU.", "Because she shares DNA with the other one. And didn't have problems with this one until girlfriend moved in. Which was OP'S mistake.", "Don't kick him out (at least yet). But you have to find some ways to become more responsible. E.g. a small rent fee for him could be a start, it'll make him understand that things cost money and he can't expect you to just foot his bills forever. And obviously basic ground rules of the house. \n\nIf he does object to anything, he's free to make his own decision, and you can keep your doors open (in case he regrets them and doesn't have any backup)...", "you wouldn't be \"making him homeless\". He would be doing that to himself.  Why is he only working part time and not fulltime?  Is he in school?  If not he should be working full-time and paying for his life.   Sure he can live with you if he wants but he should be working full-time and saving for his future", "My mom went through the same thing with me. She was a single mom that worked a few jobs, and I was a brat. Be a parent first. She kicked me out when I was 18 for a few months to let me see what it was like without her help. Big wake up call. I'm 34 now and I definitely wouldn't be where I am today if she took the friend route."]}
