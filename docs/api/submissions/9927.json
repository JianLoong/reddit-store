He's been with his girlfriend (18F) for \u22483 years now, and he asked about her moving in with us. I eventually said yes, and shes now lived with us for around 8-9 months.\n\nFor context, we live in a pretty big house with 2 kitchens, 2 bathrooms, and 4 bedrooms. There's an upstairs area where I sleep and have my own kitchen and the master bathroom. Downstairs they have their own space, and only need to come up to my area for showers. There are no issues with space and I still have my privacy, so I didn't see much of a problem. \n\nBut since she's moved in I've felt taken advantage of. \n\nShe has no job, and lost the one she *did* have almost immediately after moving in. She used to work full time but quit. \n\nWhen she first started living with me she paid a $80/month \"rent\" fee, mostly to help with utilities, and her and my son bought their own food. But now that she's lost her job, they're eating a lot of my food I buy for myself, and I'm only getting about $30 a month from my son who works part time. \n\nSo I'm left paying for almost all of their food, water, heat, etc. I was fine with this for a little while between jobs, but it's gone on for 8 months now and I don't even think she's applying anymore. \n\nThey're also very loud and inconsiderate. I sleep early, it's how I am, like 8 or 9 PM. I like to wake up a couple hours before work and enjoy the morning. And my son was always super quiet and respectful, until she moved in...\n\nNow they'll talk loudly until 12-3AM, and play music all throughout the day. I've even heard them have sex a couple times which feels so wrong since I'm his MOM. \n\nI've been unable to fall asleep until midnight on most nights. I work at 8:30 so now I'm either rushing to get out the door or losing sleep. \n\nI've told them to keep it down so many times but I feel like a nag because they don't listen and always just say \"we are\" or \"yeah wait a sec\" etc. They're completely dismissive of my needs or sleep schedule. They just don't care. Her attitude has annoyed me, because she seems to not take me seriously. I've heard her call me names behind my back multiple times. \n\nWell a month-ish ago I gave her an ultimatum. I told her if she didn't get a job and they didn't keep the noise down then she'd have to leave. She had until the end of the month (January.)  \n\nObviously Jan is over now. And I stuck to my word. I kicked her out on February 12, and she moved back in with her sister today (where she lived before moving in here, her parents are neglectful.) \n\nMy son is so mad at me. He said I'm \"heartless\" and need to give her a chance. Then basically stormed in his room and hasn't spoken to me since. I've tried texting him and explaining my side but I'm left on read.\n\nI don't want to ruin the relationship I have with my son. But the noise, disrespect, lack of job or trying, eating my food, money it cost me, it all ads up...\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676373369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1122y1q/aita_for_kicking_my_sons_girlfriend_out_of_the/", "score": 2007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did give her a chance. You told her unless she got a job and kept the noise down, she was out.  That was the chance.  Your son wanted you to give her endless chances with No consequences.\n\nYour son is being unfair.  If they want to live together they can get jobs and find their own place, like all the rest of us.", "You have allowed BOTH of them to disrespect you for too long. You should have been very firm and negotiated boundaries AND implemented them immediately. They felt that you were a pushover and could be manipulated. Best to learn from this, and make sure you define and enforce boundaries with your son. This will ensure that you get respect in the long run. Not doing this would make you an ah to yourself. NTA for now.", "NTA, it's your house, they need to follow your rules. In my opinion, you should have kicked your son out too, but it's your life.\n\nGood for you for sticking to your word, I'm sure it wasn't easy.", "NTA you asked repeatedly for improvements to be made and they were ignored. Her calling you names in your own home is completely disrespectful and it\u2019s also disrespectful that your son did not challenge her or check her on it. I don\u2019t think you owe any further apology to your son. You drew the line and now stick to it.", "NTA \nShe could have easily found a job in 8 months it might not have been a job in her field but something to bring in cash, you told them multiple times to be quieter and were ignored. It\u2019s not like she had nowhere to go if she is back at her sisters, it sounds like she is a freeloader who had plenty of warning, as for your son if he doesn\u2019t like it he can get a full time job and move out.", "NTA...this is also your son's fault. If he wishes to stay, he also needs to start showing you some respect.", "NTA - if she wants to live in your house she needs to abide by your very reasonable rules.", "NTA. It sounds as though you have been nothing but considerate and fair for the time she\u2019s stayed in YOUR home! \nIf she had attempted looking for a job etc, then potentially I\u2019d have given a little more time but it seems likely they were enjoying the free ride a little too much.", "Did not finish reading. No need to finish reading. NTA.  You should kick both of them out.", "NTA. You were being taken advantage of by both of them. On top of that, they\u2019re both highly inconsiderate. They want to live together then they can both get full time jobs, move into their own place, and pay their own bills. It\u2019s called adulting and I think both your son and his girlfriend need to start.", "NTA. You said she quit her job shortly after she moved in. Very suspicious IMO.\n\nAlso, you gave her A MONTH to find a job. Plenty of time and the rent of 80 a/m is also very reasonable.   \nThey rent from you basically and with that come certain terms.   \nYour son needs to see that as well.", "NTA. You were providing accommodations to two adults who should have been grateful for your help and should have been doing everything to make themselves less of a burden. Considering gf quit her job shortly after she moved into your home, she needed this wake-up call to realize she was being selfish. If you want to support your adult son, that's your choice, but I'd be asking him to get a full-time job if he's not in school so he's not a financial drain and isn't eating the food you buy.", "NTA. This is YOUR house. You pay the bills, you pay for food and should not have to feel like a visitor in your own home. If your son and girlfriend could not live considerately with you and the girlfriend could not even bother to get a job and pay towards some of the bills and food, then she needs t go back to where she came from. \n\nIf they want to live together so much, let them move out together and see to their own bills, make as much noise as they like and have loud sex. Then it's not your problem. But while living with you, they needed to show respect and consideration, which they were unwilling to do.", "NTA. $80 a month for safe and secure housing is frankly a wonderful deal. She's a young idiot, as is your son.\n\nIf she gets a job, even part time, I'd say let her back and give her one last chance, providing she pays. And your son as well, if he's working part time he can afford more than 30", "NTA. Your son is no prize either.   Also for him to say \u2018give her a chance\u2019 \u20268 months was a pretty long one.  Stick to your guns.   He is likely to act like he\u2019ll forgive you if she can move back in.  Don\u2019t let him manipulate you more than he already has\u2026.and realize he already has and is with the silent treatment too on top of the disrespectful shenanigans", "NTA. You set boundaries in your house and she couldn\u2019t follow the rules. Not to mention she was living there FOR FREE.  You should also encourage your son to move out too. \n\nIf he wants to be independent and live his life then let him.   In an apartment.", "NTA\n\nShe basically uses you as a free hotel. \n\nIt shouldn\u2018t be too hard for her to find a little part time job like in a coffee shop and if she really has trouble doing so she could at least make sure to work around the house, e.g. help more with cleaning and so on to make up for the utilities and the food she takes that you\u2018ve paid for.\n\nFurthermore they should respect your boundaries and you shouldn\u2018t have to tell them all the time not to play loud music past midnight.\n\nMaybe she gets more humble after one or two months with her sister and you can give her one last chance to move back in once she found a job again. \nMake them sign a contract about house rules then. That\u2018s what real life is like. They\u2018d be trouble with a landlord as well if they don\u2018t keep it down at night.", "NTA.  You were hosting two adults who were not contributing adequately to their own living expenses.  They were inconsiderate and dismissive of your needs. And they were taking advantage of you. And it sounds like your son is still doing so.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t end up pregnant. She needs a plan to get some sort of job/education. Is your son going to school? They both sound like free-loaders.", "NTA", "NTA. You made a fair deal and she didn\u2019t keep her part.", "NTA, but I hope your son is either in school or doing something which explains why he is 19 and only working part time and giving you 30 dollars a month. He's old enough to be contributing financially and otherwise (cleaning, cooking etc).", "You're NTA. She was a rude, entitled guest. Your son should be on notice that he is next if he doesn't get his act together", "NTA. It sounds like you tried talk things through and they completely disrespected you and your boundaries. If someone utterly refuses to work with you and find a way to respect each other's needs in your own home, you're right to put your foot down.", "NTA. You are not her mother. You are not obligated to care for her in any way, she\u2019s taking advantage of you by staying with you and not paying rent - which is completely unacceptable.

I have a feeling that *someday* he will see what an asshole he has been. In the meantime\u2014bc parenting never ends, it just changes\u2014you remind yourself and tell *him* that you treat him with respect and you expect him to treat *you* with respect\u2014or he will be out, too. You would not only be giving yourself much deserved love, you would be doing him and his future partners a huge favor (I\u2019m assuming he will dump that person he\u2019s with. Who the hell is *she* to call you names? And who is he to allow it?)", "Bonkers to let her move in", "Start by insisting he work full time.  There is no good reason for him to be so subsidized by you while he only works part time.  And if no one is hiring for full time jobs, then he needs a second job.", "Really I paid my own rent at 17 surely your son is as able as I was.", "I've had him pay for his own clothes, food, toiletries, car, etc. since he was 18 and that ads up. So I guess I figured \"rent\" wasn't necessary.", "This!! I hate to say it but you made a mistake letting her move in and being so lenient for so long. They wanted to have all the privileges of adulthood with the responsibilities of childhood (aka, none).  You son is made because he liked it the old way. It was easy for him and you are ruining his perfect (in his mind) lifestyle. \n\nDO NOT APOLOGIZE. You are not being mean, you are PARENTING. You kind of set yourself up for this but I don\u2019t think he will stay mad for long. You are doing the right thing for both of them by making them see real-life consequence in a way that is not as harmful as having this be evicted, thereby trashing their credit. He will be ok. Just set expectations and enforce them until he learns to set them for himself or manages to get his act together enough to move out and support himself. NTA.", "NTA. Since your son has a bad attitude and sides with her, kick him out too.", "NTA- She\u2019s an inconsiderate house guest. Your house-your rules. They can either abide by them or leave. Pretty simple. Your son sounds as if he still needs to be under a parent\u2019s roof as he does not have a full-time job but that doesn\u2019t entitle him to have a live-in girlfriend as well who isn\u2019t contributing to the household. They are two kids. You are the adult. You make the rules in your home.", "You don't have tenants. You have freeloaders. NTA", "NTA you are not the one ruining the relationship, he is, and you need to tell him that. They have had eight months of chances.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDoes he go to college? Like he can join her, but realize if he knocks her up shes going to make life difficult on you to see any grandkids.", "NTA. Let him move out. He\u2019ll see how good he had it", "NTA.  Your son is the bigger problem.", "The GF sounds annoying as hell. Good riddance. You did nothing wrong OP. You said what you said and no one listened. Let your son stay mad he'll get over it. Hopefully, he'll break up with her and get someone that helps him grow rather than stagnate him.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you did exactly the right thing.  You gave her 8 months to learn to be a respectful **guest.  She refused.**   That's **plenty** of chances to learn.  She has not **wanted to**.\n\nThis is 100% on her.  You don't owe your son any apology.", "NTA! If your son doesn\u2019t like it, he\u2019s a grown up, and he can get his own place. You deserve for your home to be functional for your needs. I\u2019m sad that you even feel the need to ask if you\u2019re T A", "NTA. As soon as the disrespect started you should have squashed it, but I understand trying for your son\u2019s sake. Although from the sounds of it you could easily afford the food, you shouldn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s one thing to pay for your son, it\u2019s quite different for a girlfriend. Good for you for sticking to what you said. It needed to happen. You were being completely disrespected!", "NTA and he can get out too if he doesn\u2019t want to respect you.", "NTA. And you should kick your son out too", "NTA.", "He pays for everything besides utilities for himself. His food, clothes, car/gas, toiletries, I make him all buy for himself. I never charged him rent until she moved in, but I did make him have some responsibility.", "Yea but he's my son. I don't want to kick him out and let him be homeless or put some kind of burden on his girlfriend's family. Trust me, his gf having to move out is definitely punishment to him too.", "He also pays for all his own food and other consumables, clothes, car/gas on his own for context", "Excellent idea.  Her son should be more actively contributing to the household expenses.  Then he can get an idea of precisely why it bothered her so much.  Food costs have gone up dramatically, after all.\n\nAnd hopefully the bad habits he got into when his gf was living with them will go away, eventually.", "Time to be his mother, not his friend. You need to help him develop into a functional adult by making him get a full time job or be in college full time.", "That's fine, but if your son is only working part-time and not attending school then all you are doing is enabling him. I get how hard it is, I'm a single parent with a teen but you aren't teaching him independence with your current setup.\n\nAt 19 he should be in school, learning a trade or working full-time. If he's not doing one of these three things (or a combination of them) then perhaps it's time to ask him to leave. Honestly, a few weeks living with his gf's sister might be the wake-up call he needs.", "You don't just have a girlfriend problem you have a son problem, they are a couple of mooches. The reason they don't work and party till 3:00 a.m. is because they can, because they don't have a place to be the next morning like the rest of the working population. YTA if you let this continue, they are just taking advantage.", "Depends on the family.  Some people do just fine having their partner move in while still living with their parent(s).  It depends on whether *all* the parties involved are prepared to act respectfully of each other.  If you can't respect your fellow housemates, then don't be surprised when there are consequences.", "Thanks for the advice", "He is paying for everything besides utilities/the house itself. I've always made him buy his own food/other necessities since he turned 18. He works part time (4 days/week) because he can afford it right now. I wanted to let him be young and enjoy not being slaved away to a full time job while he can.", "Yeah, I currently live with my partner and his mother as well while we're saving up for a house since we live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and it's awfully hard to save and pay rent at the same time. \n\nHowever, my partner and I both have jobs, pay our own bills, are respectful of her space, and we're very very quiet when we do have sex because ultimately, it's mostly her space, not ours. It helps that we're not teenagers and we're in our 20s with actual careers."]}
