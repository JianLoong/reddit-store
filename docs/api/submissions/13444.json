It has felt very love filled. We recently got into an apartment, one bedroom like 700 square ft so not huge. Once this happened I feel like things may have shifted. I work very long hours throughout the week with sometimes only one or maybe zero days off in the week, average of 75-80 hours a week. I bring home a majority of the money, (my paychecks are almost over 80% our whole income) not that it affects how I think of her and our relationship.\n\n She is able to provide things like fun groceries (snacks/sweets) and when we go out she can pay for things like the tip or drinks and I really appreciate that and tell her thank you when she can swing it. She also does most of the chores in the small apt. Other than that I'm the person paying for our life. (Groceries/toiletries/outings/clothes/makeup and not to mention rent and all other real bills)\n\nShe works in a VERY different field and works  3 sometimes if her job requires, 4 days a week. She is working toward her career and I'm proud of her for this. Most days she'll work an average of 6 maybe 7 hours on her work days. This is where the problem has started. \n\nAlot of my work nights are late, 12 or 1 am when I get home. Ill pack snacks but never get to eat. So alot of days I come home hungry for an actual meal. Recently those nights have been more frequent and i just don't want to have to cook something for myself after a 13 hour day after doing the same all week. I just want to be able to eat with the minimal amount of work when I get home.\n\nThe other night I came home around 1:30AM and found my wife passed out on the couch with an empty personal pizza from Little Ceasars. I got excited thinking that I had a cold one in the fridge waiting for me.....wrong. annoyed but not upset, I microwave some chef boyardee, scarf it down and call it a night. The next day I have the same kind of night, around 1:30 I get home. There she is passed out, now with a bowl of macaroni and weenies (one of my favorites) and again. Nothing in the fridge for me. \n\nNot understanding why she couldn't just make enough for the both of us and put my bowl in the fridge, wake her up to ask. She gets a little snappy if someone wakes her up but this time she was pissed.\nSaying that she is NOT my maid and I'm being lazy trying to make her cook for me. I tell her I'm just hungry after a long day and it upset me seeing she cooked for herself and didn't think about me at all. I said she was being inconsiderate and that really set her off. Saying if I want a slave then she's not it. I told her I don't want a slave, I want a wife who seems to care about me. She looked at me with a shocked face and stormed out.  Her mother texted saying she showed up at their house balling and HOW I should be more considerate to her feelings. I haven't even responded because I just feel hurt and not cared for.\n\nI just wanted dinner. AITA?\n\nEdit: i really should have mentioned this is a conversation we have had before and i feel ignored since she barely acknowledges when ive brought it up. These last 2 times are after multiple \"conversations\" . Also definitely didn't want to seem like she shouldn't be sleeping at 1. Passed out is just terminology I use. If I'm dead asleep at 4 am I'm passed out. I appreciate the other things she does for me like cleaning but the other 8 hours of free time in her day I wanted to be thought of since I would do the same for her no questions.", "created_utc": 1680055907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125a3d5/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_make_my_dinner/", "score": 1570, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re asking that when she makes supper, she make enough for two. I\u2019m hoping that her out-sized & irrational response happened because you woke her up & were probably a bit irritated in your presentation. I\u2019m guessing crying to her mom was a lot about her personal feelings of guilt realizing that she\u2019s been a thoughtless, inconsiderate ass. I\u2019m hoping things are better for both of you tomorrow.", "Wow this comment section is shocking to me. I really empathize with you, I'm sure you're exhausted by the time you are done. It's wildy unreasonable to think you are an asshole if your standards are just a frozen pizza too. This is sad", "Nta, and i do not care how much this gets down voted. Wow, are any of you married? It seems like just common curiosity to save a little something for the person busting their butt to provide everything.  OP, maybe treat yourself to take out and label it so that she can't have any to match that energy.  Maybe then she'll see how ridiculous she is being.  She seriously couldn't just order a 2nd pizza?!??", "NTA - if someone cares about you, they will find ways to take care of you.  Wifey could easily order a second pizza or cook enough Mac and weenies for two. She should actually want to as a decent person, let alone as your spouse.  BUT to make all the mule carriers happy, start having a dasher meet you at home with your evening meal for one.  Let her enjoy her personal pizza while you enjoy your steak and potatoes. See how long she supports that arrangement. \n\nHonestly, your wife sounds a little spoiled and self-centered.  Your feelings are valid.  Though I think there are bigger issues that need to be addressed.", "Massive NTA. Is everyone missing the fact that she is making her own dinner with absolutely no thought to her husband and life partner who\u2019s working ridiculous hours and earning majority of their income?

That\u2019s absolutely the bare minimum.", "I think it should kind of just go without saying that if you\u2019re cooking dinner, you would also cook enough for your SPOUSE!

Ordering a personal pizza and eating all of knowing your spouse is at work all night is insane. Literally what.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you tell her to cook\nFor you at 2am. She can at least save you some when she makes it for herself", "NTA...  Marriage?  I did this for roommates, and they did it for me.  Hell my *neighbors* and I do it for each other.\n\nIt's the decent thing to do.  We help each other out, that's why we are cohabitating to start with.  \n\nSorry, man.  I been there myself, I know how it is.  I do agree with a previous poster, there is something else to this.  She's trying to make a statement, she's upset or hurt about something (benefit of the doubt for those) - or she's checked out of the relationship and is distancing herself for a move.\n\nHaving said that...  even when I was checked out and heading for divorce, I still made enough dinner for two...", "By her logic, you're the slave. You bring in 80% of the income. You work 75-80 hours a week, which is basically like working two full time jobs. You allow her a lifestyle she wouldn't be able to afford on her income alone.\n\nIf I was an alien taking notes, I'd classify you the slave. \n\nIt's not too much to expect that she either order more or cook extra so you have something to eat at 1am. It's kind of common courtesy...hell, I even cooked extra for my housemate and he wasn't paying my bills.\n\nI also wouldn't have thought this is something you had to explain to her...does her brain work?\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf she cooks for herself, adding a few more ingredients for an extra serving is not hard at all, doesn't require much effort.", "Nta. The courteous thing for her to do is to make enough for both of you and put some in the fridge for you.", "Christ,  the least she could do is double what she makes/orders and put it in the fridge. That seems like a no Brainer to me.\n\nI'm gonna vote NTA. ESPECIALLY if you're working 7 days a week and she's working 4 at the most.", "NTA, my husband occasionally works late for business dinners or receptions. When that happens I rarely know if he will have eaten, but I always ensure there\u2019s leftovers in the fridge waiting for him and I let him know what it is in advance. If he doesn\u2019t want it or if he already ate, I have it for lunch the next day.

I go to work and it\u2019s dark and get home and it\u2019s dark. I have like 2 hours max in which I can both be at home and awake. I have to use those 2 hours for laundry, personal errands, bathing, and unwinding. Some days it\u2019s all I can do to zombie chew a cold piece of pizza before passing out to do it all again. \n\nYou\u2019re not asking for extravagance, he\u2019ll you\u2019re not even asking for extra, if your bar is cold pizza and Mac n cheese it\u2019s a very low one. As busy as I am, as exhausted as I am, I would literally *never, ever* make a meal, order takeout or go thru a drive thru and not get extra for my partner. It takes nothing extra to cook for two, order for two, buy for two when you\u2019re doing it for one. \n\nTo order herself pizza only, purely selfish. To make Mac n cheese for only herself again, purely selfish. That anyone who has a SO or even empathy can\u2019t see that kills me. I don\u2019t understand her logic nor the berating from her mom. You asked for nothing but courtesy and consideration. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t leave a stranger unfed in my home if I was eating.", "My GF gets home later than I do constantly. There is ALWAYS some food waiting for her, either on the table if she\u2019s home at 7 or in the fridge when she works late. NTA. I couldn\u2019t imagine not preparing something for her when I\u2019m already cooking.", "Based on your edit: very much NTA. This is a reasonable request. Marriage is a partnership - try asking any of the people here saying YTA if they think the money is 80% yours or belongs to both spouses. If your wife doesn\u2019t want to meet you in the middle here (maybe because she is sick of you working so late all the time - it\u2019s also fair for her to not like the deal in the relationship and maybe she wants to adjust it!) I have a hard time imagining how she is supporting you in this relationship. Waking her up at 1am is serious, but if you asked for a little consideration and haven\u2019t gotten any I don\u2019t think you are out of line expressing how that makes you feel.", "Nta. I would just say I'm not a slave either, I'll cut down to 40 hours a week and you pick up another 20, then I'll cook for myself and you can continue to cook for yourself only.", "NTA. My boyfriend works long hours, and I do the majority of the cooking and almost always make sure there are leftovers for him to have a healthy meal. Every once in a while, I don't feel like cooking, and it's fend for yourself. It sounds like she doesn't really cook healthy meals at all. Regardless, she should be putting more effort in on the home front if you are bringing in the money", "If she really works just under 10 hours a week you aren't remotely the AH here. It's literally uttering a 2nd sentence \"Hey make that 2 pizzas not one\". Open an extra package of sausage and mac and stick it in a slightly bigger pot...It's literally tiny things. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Classic Reddit will be overwhelming AH. I would never not leave something for my spouse if they were working all day and especially if I cooked something for myself.  And I would absolutely expect my spouse to do the same.", "NTA. I'm all about equality but if you're bringing most of the income and your work hours reflect that, it's reasonable for the other to try and help you out. I want to say that you should lay out expectations more clearly but your edit seems like you did so I don't think you're the AH.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Cooking one extra portion or ordering a little extra for you doesn't take much effort. If, as your wife, she can't do somehing as trivial as that for you, I have no words.", "NTA. She needs to start cooking enough for both of you. It\u2019s SO little effort to double whatever she\u2019s getting. The fact she turned this into you being the problem is terrible, too.", "NTA. Your wife is being so outta pocket.", "Wow, NTA. I lived with my siblings and I wouldn\u2019t even grab fast food without a text asking if they\u2019d want anything. When we were working opposing schedules (9-5 for me, late restaurant shifts for them), they\u2019d make big lunches and leave leftovers in the fridge for me and I\u2019d order a large pizza after work and only eat two slices or pack up plates of the dinner I\u2019d make for them and leave them in the fridge.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine not even getting an extra frozen pizza for my *spouse*. Even without them pulling an 80 hour work week.", "I N F O have you ever asked her to prepare enough for two if she makes dinner for herself on your late workdays?\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask, so long as you actually did ask.

They want to, they actively try. \n\nI want to show my partner I appreciate him, and be there in the ways he needs because I love him and it genuinely makes me happy to make him happy - that\u2019s the motivator. Nothing transactional, no games, no power plays. Just a genuine desire to make his world just a little bit better everyday. \n\nWhen that\u2019s the focus, above all else, at least in a really healthy relationship, the result just effortlessly is reciprocation because you want that for each other and you want to return it to each other. \n\nPractically, just make a double batch of mac and cheese with weenies and put it in the fridge.

It is not at all unreasonable that she could order an extra pizza or heat up more -checks notes- macaroni and weenies for you. I feel like that is the lowest a bar could be set.  \n\nThat being said, I think you have a bigger issue. I believe that it is entirely possible that she is feeling neglected due to your long working hours and that this is her way of lashing out.

I think it would go a long way if you could find a day to take her out to a nice dinner and then spend the evening together.", "nta", "Nta - she is selfish.  It is not any harder to buy a large pizza than 1 personal pizza.  Does she care about you at all?", "NTA when you cook / order in, you cook / order for your and spouse / SO.

I was in a similar situation with my ex. Before we had kids, he made about 4x what I did and worked crazy long hours (usually overnight shifts, lots of overtime, and many 16-20 hour shifts) while I worked a more standard 9-5. I always felt like a lame homemaker, but I would have super simple things ricearoni with ground turkey and veggies, macaroni and hotdogs, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, leftover crock pot beef stew, etc. that I'd premake and leave in the fridge portioned out so he'd always have something to grab for a quick meal or to take to work as a lunch. If she's home way more it's really not a crazy ask for her to throw some stew ingredients in a crock pot or make two boxes of macaroni instead of one.", "You are not a husband you are her sugar daddy.

You need to find someone that respects you.", "Nta, your wife is incredibly lazy and the fact that she can\u2019t take you into consideration when making meals and only working 4 days a week is honestly gross.

Let\u2019s take the fact that it\u2019s meal-making out of the story for a second because that one\u2019s tinged with triggers. In every relationship there are needs and the essence of a partnership is a shared meeting of those needs for each other. I\u2019m my best when my partner is his best and vice versa. \n\nSometimes that means I do more of one thing for my partner than he does back, and same the other way around. When you have a need that your partner can fulfill, I\u2019d suggest expressing it without resentment or an expectation that your partner should already know it. \n\nI\u2019d hope your wife can see that having a made an extra meal for you would go a long way to your wellbeing and therefore hers by extension. Perhaps setting up a plan or communicating during the day about it will make it easier for her. \n\n(Or perhaps this simply isn\u2019t a need your wife feels she can fulfill, and if that is the case that\u2019s within her right to look out for her own needs too.

First of all, don't wake someone up at almost 2 in the morning for NO REASON other than you wanted macaroni and weenies. This wasn't a reason to wake her up.

Personally, I don't think it's at all unreasonable to want a plate in the fridge for you as long as you're okay with having whatever she felt like eating.

It's not like you're refusing to cook for yourself, it's just that it'd be nice not to have to if she already figured out dinner anyway.

Working 75-80 hours a week, 6-7 days a week, and frequently getting home after she\u2019s asleep leaves little time to connect with your spouse. And when that connection is missing, it can make a marriage feel very transactional rather than like a partnership. Not making you dinner or picking up pizza for you feels like your wife having given up on that connection.  From her standpoint, it may feel like there\u2019s no point to making dinner for you because who knows when you\u2019ll be home or if you\u2019ll want dinner when you get there, but either way you won\u2019t be having dinner with her. That can be kind of depressing. But the lack of those little gestures takes a toll on you too.\n\nI will also note that the extensive detail of who pays for what in your marriage contributes to the feeling that your marriage has a lot of bean counting and about who is contributing how much.  You may think you\u2019re being generous in that regard, but it may not feel that way to her if it feels like you\u2019re doing her a favor by paying for dinner.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you\u2019re TA for working those hours; there may be very good reason to do so, especially if this phase of your career is of limited duration and you\u2019ll soon be able to work a more reasonable schedule.

I think it\u2019s only normal for one to think their spouse cares for them enough to ask what are you eating today or just making extra if they\u2019re at work. I think it only shows how selfish she is and how easily since she\u2019s already cooking she could make more to put away for you or order an extra pizza for you. It sucks when you work all day expecting some leftovers at least to find none. Im guessing from what you mention at the end this has been a discussion in the past. So if you were to cut away any frivolous things she\u2019s wants she would throw a fit ?", "NTA. You\u2019re not asking her for gourmet meals, you literally just want her to think of you when she\u2019s feeding herself. It wouldn\u2019t take much effort for her to get pizza for you too, or make two portions of whatever she\u2019s already making for herself. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re asking for a lot.", "NTA. In my relationship, we ask each other for things we need, and then we give them to each other if we can.

Like maybe she\u2019s lonely, or maybe she\u2019s depressed. Could you work on it in therapy, if you can find the time? In the meantime, could you use your salary to set up some recurring meal solution/subscription to keep you sustained?\n\nI have a bunch of physicians in my life and I swear they all have this problem.

Make a little extra so you can eat? These are very reasonable requests. I\u2019m gonna go with NTA since you don\u2019t seem to be asking that she go out of her way to do something and honestly as a wife it\u2019s always nice to have hubs some dinner when he gets home.

I worked as I could during that time but knowing he worked until 2 or 3 in the morning, I always either made enough food for him or ordered enough for him, if I ordered delivery. Even if I knew he might not eat it because he had food from work, I feel like it\u2019s common courtesy? Like, sure there were times when I made a sandwich or ramen and he was okay to fend for himself on those occasions (typically because he was also aware that we needed a grocery run).\n\nThat being said, when I went back to work full time, our schedules worked out that I work two days when he is off (for context, he has four days off a week, the same every week). For the first two weeks I\u2019d come home and he\u2019d have ordered something for himself just an hour or two earlier and nothing for me. It took twice of that happening before it didn\u2019t happen again.

She was inconsiderate, but had to make it your fault so she doesn't have to accept any responsibility for being selfish. That seems to be the defining quality of an adult relationship: the ability to see the fault in ourself and to accept responsibility while working on doing better. Her reaction was immature as hell. How you choose to deal with it should be interesting....", "NTA. That\u2019s honestly rude AF!! I make enough to share with my ROOM MATE when I\u2019m cooking despite the fact we work the same hours/job.

I\u2019m also confused is if she\u2019s making macaroni and weenies she couldn\u2019t make enough for two. This just doesn\u2019t sound out of line at all. If I\u2019m cooking, I cook enough so that everybody can have some no matter what time they roll in or even the next day. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that she\u2019s cooking for one person and then, she can\u2019t even take you into consideration. I find it very offensive actually. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. It's not that hard to double what you are already cooking for yourself. That's incredibly thoughtless of a spouse. Leftovers and a couple of slices of old pizza is not a huge ask. I feel like that's common courtesy in a partnership.", "NTA, I\u2019m all for both partners doing chores but when one partner is working far more hours leaving some left overs for them later or some pizza if you order it is not asking for much.

My partner works late shifts regularly. I still make dinner for both of us, just put half of it in Tupperware to heat up later. It is absolutely no more effort than making dinner for myself.", "NTA \nI see this as a matter of logistics & basic consideration for your partner.

The financial arrangement you have with your spouse is somewhat similar to what I have with my wife. \n\nMy wife pays for our way of life, I contribute money as well, but groceries, household and hygienic necessities and do the majority of the housework. In addition, I cook 5-6 days a week. I will make our lunches for work, dinner when she comes home if she\u2019s hungry and usually make a breakfast for us one day of the weekend. \n\nTo me that\u2019s a no brainer.

I hope y\u2019all are able to work this out", "NTA - my husband and I are the same age as you two. We\u2019ve been together 6 years. He was in the Navy but got out last year. He now goes to school full time using his GI Bill from 8-2 and works full time as well after school working from 3-11. This is Monday - Friday. Only day he has off from school is Friday but he still has work. I\u2019m a dental hygienist and work 4 days a week, previously worked 3 due to wrist issues. I make about $15 more than him. We have no kids but have 2 dogs. If I\u2019m being honest, we\u2019ve definitely had arguments where I feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of and I\u2019m just here to do his chores and make his meals. However, I had to take a seat and realize he is working himself to the bone. Not because money is tight or he needs to. Honestly we\u2019re good, but he\u2019s that kind of person. I guess the military played a huge role into him having to always be working hard 24/7. Even though he is working and is busy a lot, I actually never see him during the weekdays bc I work 7-5 usually. So it\u2019s usually just a kiss goodbye in the am. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve realized that ITA in this. I have 3 days off he has 2. And those two days are spent catching up on schoolwork. So I usually try to get all his laundry done, meal prep for us, etc. The only thing I truly ask of him is to take the dogs out in the am before school. On the days I have off, I\u2019ll do it. However, I started to stop meal prepping and wasting my days off when he wasn\u2019t eating the meals I\u2019d prepare hours on end for. So I stopped. He\u2019s finally gone grocery shopping for himself even if it\u2019s freezer meals. Sometimes after work I\u2019m so exhausted. I won\u2019t even make a meal for myself so forget making one for him. I tend to feel guilty but tbh it\u2019s not my responsibility. I\u2019ll text him to give him a heads up to grab food or tell him what I made and if he wants some, if not I\u2019ll throw it out etc. Anyways, not to make this about us, but I don\u2019t think YTA. You\u2019re providing for your family the ways that you can. I also have a bad taste in my mouth that she ran to her mom immediately regarding the argument you two had. I have never once said a thing to my own mother regarding my relationship over heinous things like that. That\u2019s personal and should be worked out between you two. A marriage is meant to help one another out. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s pulling her weight or necessarily understanding why it is that you\u2019d like a meal even if it is fast food or a frozen meal. At least she is actively thinking of you and being a partner to you. I\u2019d truly have another deeper conversation with her on what it is that you both are needing to have both of your needs met.", "NTA. If my partner was working 12/13 hours until 1:30 AM, making extra mac and cheese or buying an extra pizza for him would be the bare minimum I can do honestly.", "NTA - my mom would make dinner and leave some out for my dad your really not asking for much lmao", "If she\u2019s cooking for herself already it really takes no added effort to just make double the portion and put the rest in the fridge for you, NTA", "NTA\nI am a local truck driver, I work 12-14 hour shifts 5 days a week. My boyfriend stays home with our kids and is a full time hybrid (in school and online) college student. He takes care of dinner every night for himself and the kids since I don\u2019t get home until 11pm-1am. Every night he cook, there is a plate waiting for me in the fridge to pop in the microwave when I get home. When he is having a rough day and gets pizza or takes the kids to get fast food, he lets me know and I\u2019m lucky enough to have fast food places that are open that I can swing through on my way home. He still usually asks if I want him to make me a plate of leftovers or put some rice in the rice cooker for me.\n\nThe point being, when he takes care of dinner for himself and the kids, he also takes the time to make sure I\u2019m going to be able to eat when I get home. Even though he\u2019s tired from school and kids all day. Because he loves me. On my off days I give him a break from cooking and the kids. But when I have to do overtime and work 6-7 days a week, he picks up the slack at home with no complaints. Because we\u2019re partners. \n\nBeing in a relationship is doing what you can to make your partner\u2019s life easier while they do what they can to make yours easier. Setting aside food for you to eat when you get home is such a small thing for her to do to make your life easier. YOU are not the AH, but she just might be.", "NTA\n\nIt's called consideration for your spouse/partner. I make the majority of all the meals in the house, and if my wife was to have to work late, I'd ensure that there is a plate or bowl put aside for her, and she would do the same. \n\nBut on top of all that, I'd be seriously looking for a role that pays what you are currently earning, but one that you have to work less hours. Your hours of work is unsustainable and will eventually cause burn out, and that will be even worse on your relationship than a lack of a cooked dinner when you get home.", "NTA I always think of my partner when I eat. Like when I get a pizza, he gets one too. That\u2019s not being a slave, that\u2019s being nice\u2026he does the same for me when he eats while i\u2019m at work", ">average of 75-80 hours a week. I bring home a majority of the money, (my paychecks are almost over 80% our whole income)\n\nNope. 80 hours a week to contribute 80% of your income and she can't even leave a plate for you or order a damn pizza for you? She bought a pizza for herself and not you. She goes crying to her mom when you try to bring it up yet again. I'd be looking into a separation. She works ~20 hours a week. Nope. \n\nI am not even coming from a love standpoint. This is just common sense if your partner works 80 hours a week while you work twenty to pay 80% of your joint bills, at least leave them a plate or they're going to leave you for someone that isn't an asshole.", "NTA", "Nta.... hell you even said you would be happy with a bowl of food in the fridge to heat up. That is just basic minimal respect. not for nothing but most women in a break up actually detach months before the actual breakup/divorce. She ain't even barely thinking of you in even a small way. I would actually suggest marriage counseling. Look as a woman in this modern society with so many broken marriages as the norm, it's not like we have much of a road map/ manual on how to take care of a partner long term.  In fact I know when I married at 18, to technically my only boyfriend I ever had, I was told by so many that I was selling myself short/ should have more partners in life. (I loved my husband for years before we even dated) Now after 19 years of marriage, I can honestly say it takes constant reflection on how can I help make my spouses life better. I also know my husband does the same. But that did not come easy. Both of our parents were divorces with abuse. But we had to realize that if we really loved each other we had to actually make an effort. Marriage was hard at first, but there are exercises to help that you can learn with counseling. One that really helped me was forcing myself atleast once a day to remind myself of something I am grateful for that my husband does. Sometimes when I feel like I am on the back burner for his career advancement or what have you, sometimes I had to dig deep lol. But gratitude goes a long way! Now I have an amazing marriage, and through years of practice we have habits that help us. My husband worked hard on listening to me when I talk, and through years of him practicing that I get shocked at what he remembers me saying. The other day he came home from his 12 hour shift at the hospital and woke me up with a surprise. I told him next year I wanted erasable color pencils to help with math lessons. It was a random conversation. He came home randomly with that and some ergonomic crochet hooks because he noticed my hands bother me more. ( I am not trying to brag but to say these behaviors DO NOT just happen) You have to work towards making your spouse the priority, and she needs to do the same for you. Counseling can really help that.", "NTA- this is extremely reasonable to ask. If she is already expanding the effort (using spoons) to cook or order food, then it isn\u2019t hardly any extra effort to get enough for two. I feel like there is some underlining issue that is bothering her", "NTA\n\nYour wife left because you made a good point, and she couldn't come up with a response, so she ran to her mom and made her snap at you.\n\nYour wife sounds selfish, spoiled, and without empathy. This is a sign of a bigger issue with your marriage", "NTA!!!!! Wow at her MIL sticking her nose in, not a smart move at all! Your girlfriend sounds a bit entitled tbh, and maybe a bit immature. Personally, I would be aiming for more equality in the relationship, but until that's achieved, ask her to make double portions of whatever she does so that you can eat without fuss. I understand the feelings of frustration at her, but with some people, you have to spell it out for them rather than assume they know what you need/want.", "NTA. I really hope she can get perspective on this. Then hopefully have a conversation about it where she understands that preparing or buying enough food for 2 instead of 1 on nights you work late will make you feel appreciated and loved (let alone fed!)", "NTA pretty inconsiderate of her. I make extra even if my spouse says he doesn\u2019t want any. I do it because he almost always eats some later.", "NTA. The partner who works the least amount of hours should get the larger portion of cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc responsibilities. These responsibilities should benefit the partnership.", "From the title I thought maybe you were demanding she cooks a 3 course dinner when you come home at 6. But all you\u2019re asking for is that if she makes something for herself, to make enough for you too. Which is so basic I feel for you even having to ask. There must be something more going on for your wife. How did you live before this? Has she had setbacks in her career? Anything else? Perhaps on your next day or even8ng off, take some time to have a date night, and talk for real. Take care, and nta.", "NTA. I would be shocked if I worked late and my partner made food for everyone but me, and vice versa. People in relationships should care about each other. Takes almost no effort to double a recipe, especially if it's literally Mac n cheese with fucking hotdogs.", "NTA. My fiance is working late on a project. I was going to get taco bell. I know he hates it, so instead I spent 3x as much to make sure he had takeout in the fridge when he got home. He isn't going to be that late, but I know it helps his day.", "NTA. OP, to me you have two clear options since you've already talked to her about this issue a lot.\n\n1. Remove her from all shared accounts. Keep all your money separate. Stop covering her half of the bills. Tell her that you saw your relationship more as a partnership, where you help each other. But she sees it more as, \"every man for himself,\" so you're going to start treating things that way moving forward. I would get your own fridge, with your own lock, and start ordering ready made meals that are NICER and have those instead. She might find making good meals harder without the money to spend on them, but, who cares? Every man for himself.\n2. Or, you end things. You realize that you two want different things, and she's never going to consider your feelings. She's never going to care about you as a person. She was just the wrong partner.\n\nI'd honestly lean toward the second. There are so many things that can \"change\" in a partner, but I've never seen a selfish partner change.", "NTA for sure", "NTA. Seriously, why can't she double the amount of food she makes for herself so there is some left for him?", "I would say NTA. If she was cooking, two portions is not so different than one. If she was ordering, same thing. It's not like you are expecting a full course meal. I assume you would make her breakfast and vice versa on a weekend morning. Spouses take care of each other!", "NTA, marriage is give and take. If she is making a meal for herself anyhow and you\u2019re working a shit ton of hours, why can\u2019t she be considerate and make a little more for you too? \nAnd tell her mother to eff off. Seriously, don\u2019t respond to her mom. Your marriage is none of her fucking business and you don\u2019t owe her an explanation about anything. \nDon\u2019t start talking to your wife through her mom. That will be disastrous", "NTA. She should WANT to be supportive of him!", "NTA I run an in home business as well as a small side job but my fiance is the real bread winner and works longer hours than I do, and there has never been a day he has come home from work and had to fend for himself.  Even when he came home at 2 am I set an alarm to wake up and heat him up some dinner while he showered so he could eat and then get some sleep .

It's a bad look. That's a bad impression to your plight. \n\nThere are multiple ways you can handle this and it starts with approaching it at a time that's good for you both to talk if you're talking about a whole life and schedule and routine change. You don't wake someone up for that. That's a \"this could take an hour,\" kind of thing. In your approach you were totally an asshole.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can approach this. 1, if money's not that big an issue, buy more groceries and include ready-made things that are fresh and filling and you can eat chilled or easily heated. \n\n2. Since she's ordering pizza sometimes, maybe leave some money at the beginning of the day and talk to her about ordering enough of whatever the take out she's going to get for herself to have some too when you get home. Getting take out and stuff like that at the beginning of a new routine you've talked about can help her adjust without feeling pressured to cook for you. Spoiler alert: because of thousands of years of male oppression, women do not in any way like being asked to do menial chores and tasks, cook for anyone, some even have difficulties with requests for sex and things like that even if they themselves might want it. We've grown up watching our mothers not have a choice in participating in these things, and sometimes when younger we didn't either. A lot of us grew up with pressure and bullying from our families to cook, and clean, raise our siblings, ect, ect.\n\nAnother reason you shouldn't wake someone up from a slumber at 1am to talk about cooking for you.\n\n3. When you have this talk, bring up that if she doesn't mind sometimes, when she's making macaroni or something easy, just pour in another box and make a little more if she's up for it.\n\nWhen first starting this potential new adjustment, I would be open to the idea of fairly frequent take out in the beginning if possible. That way you can ask casually if she wouldn't mind regularly ordering some take out for you so it's there when you get there so she doesn't feel pressured or feel like it's all about cooking for you or who spends the most time on chores or who makes the most of what. \n\nIf you apologize for your approach, approach her at a better time, and request that at nights maybe she can order take out for you if she doesn't feel like cooking or just make a little more of the same thing and save it for you, maybe she'll be open to that.", "NAH. Totally understand feeling hurt that she didn\u2019t think of you, but waking her up in the night to fuss at her about not having made you dinner put her in a really bad situation. Especially given that she already does the majority of the household chores, and that she does work (even if significantly fewer hours) as well, for her then to be criticized for not doing another chore rather than thanked for the ones she does already isn\u2019t reasonable. That said, marriage is a partnership, so if you\u2019re working significantly longer hours and figuring out food after getting home late is a challenge, it\u2019s reasonable to ask her to help out w/ that. You\u2019re not at fault for wanting that help.\n\nBut it\u2019s still her helping you if she does, just like you paying for most things is you helping her and not something she should take for granted. She clearly feels like you\u2019ve demanded specific chores from her transactionally, rather than asked for her help solving a problem you have, given her reaction. Don\u2019t let the situation get adversarial; apologize for waking her up late, and reframe your request to focus on how figuring out food late after a long day is difficult for you and asking if she wouldn\u2019t mind helping.
