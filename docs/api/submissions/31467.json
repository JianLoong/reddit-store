My SIL Lex (23f) barely shows interest in seeing our kids, didn't visit or give any gifts for myself or Paul for our birthdays, and did a quick 10min visit for each of our kids the day before their birthdays. She also won't be seeing us for Christmas or her birthday, which is the day after, because she wants to spend it with her BF of 2 months.

I finished in October cause I don't like the crowds close to Christmas and so I can layby things. I do most of the shopping, with input from Paul, because he works 40 hour weeks and studies part time. The only person he shops for solo is me.\n\nThis year I suggested doing a gift basket for Lex, a big one for both Christmas and her birthday cause she always waits til her birthday to open everything anyway.

Paul told her we already made a gift basket. MIL wrote back \"you know how she is, why not gift the basket to someone else and get her this?\" My partner responded \"no, we made it for her.\" MIL told us to prepare for SIL to feel upset that we didn't get her a gift she actually wants and went on about how it is hard for her being born so close to Christmas then suggested we give the gift basket to SIL for Christmas and the charm to her for her birthday if we don't want to give it to someone else. We said no and she called us unthoughtful assholes. \n\nThe basket actually cost a bit more than a single charm; I spent a month doing it.

She is also not required to buy you or your hubby birthday presents.  \n\nDo a secret Santa for adults for Christmas; only those that choose to participate.  Just a card or something small, if anything, for birthdays.
