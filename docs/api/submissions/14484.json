I can't emphasize this enough! You should NEVER be asked to conceal something about yourself by someone who's supposed to love you! Frankly, your hair sounds cool.

His family\u2019s approval of you (or lack thereof) shouldn\u2019t be tied to your appearance, and your boyfriend should have your back, not caving to his family\u2019s judgmental ways. I would rethink whether you want to have a partner who makes you feel this way and doesn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA - THAT IS A HUGE RED FLAG!! You have a natural occurring skin condition, so why is that embarrassing or should be hidden? It's a part of who you are and something to own without feeling rejected by it.

No one has the right to police your body and appearance, including your boyfriend and his parents. \n\nOut of curiosity: Were the parents bold enough to ask about your hair, or did you volunteer any information about your condition? Even people who are judgmental about \"non-standard\" hair colors (which I think is shitty) would likely be more accepting if they knew it resulted from a medical condition. You just have to decide whether this level of judgmental/controlling behavior is something you want to put up with the rest of your life.", "NTA.

Your partner should be someone who will support and defend you, not shame you into covering up your body. It\u2019s also weird that his parents would care.

If they have a problem with that, that\u2019s on them but you should be with someone who\u2019ll defend you\n\nEdit for typos", "Who the FUCK are you hanging out with that can't handle hair? Why would you choose to spend time with these people? Are they/you all rich or something?", "NTA - You BF is afraid of his parents being judgmental over a medical condition!?  Why are you with someone who doesn't stand up for you?!  Red Flags all over on this.", "Ummm...WAT?!?! Lol, NTA, take your enviously chic natural hair and leave him, immediately!!!!", "It's literally something you can't control. Your bf is shaming your condition.

Wow, that is shallow of him and his parents. But he's the one that really matters. Now you know how he feels.", "NTA.\n\nI'm somewhere between baffled and wanting to laugh at your BF. They are upset about a skin/hair condition that is genetic? That you don't have much control over (I mean, I'm guessing you could color it if you wanted to, although I don't know if that would bother your skin)? \n\nI can't figure out how covering your hair would help. It's not something a lot of Western women do, so wouldn't that raise questions on its own?\n\nThis all makes no sense and I know there's more here between you but geez -- he sounds awful. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nTom sucks. \n\nAlso, I'm not clear about what you are describing. But that doesn't actually matter.", "INFO: You\u2019ve been dating for YEARS and they\u2019ve never even seen a picture of you?? This feels fake.", "Definitely NTA.

To hell with what he and his parents think.", "NTA\n\nFix him up by ending it with him.\n\nYour hair sounds cool. I have an extended family member with this and she rocks it. It's a part of her and she's never let it stand in her career or travelling the world. When explaining differences to my toddler we say \"if someone cannot fix it in 5 seconds, we don't mention it.\" Those things relate to food stuck in teeth or toilet paper on foot or tag labels still stuck on clothes. \n\nSome folks pay for highlights and you have one naturally.

Particularly since it\u2019s not even like you dyed it. It\u2019s NATURAL. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dying your hair to look black and white on either side, but not accepting someone\u2019s natural look is even worse IMO. You shouldn\u2019t have to cover the real you no matter what\n\nThis family isn\u2019t worth it. If his parents are as superficial as he\u2019s saying, then I honestly doubt he\u2019s much better.

This is such a stupid request on his part. Half the world is walking around with purple/blue/pink hair and your natural hair is a problem? Fuck that. Your hair sounds awesome by the way and I bet a lot of people (myself included) would pay big money to have hair like yours.", "NTA - Tom just showed you his true colors. You never need to feel like you need to hide parts of yourself. This is a red flag to me.

If I were you I would end the relationship", "I'm 49, I just went a little too long to get my roots done for my usual red and I noticed I have a little gray streak right at the top of my forehead. Just silvery threads everywhere else but it's pretty gray in that one spot.\n\nI told my hairdresser to leave it because I can't wait to look like Storm (X-Men).\n\nYour boyfriend is a jerk.", "NTA.

If his parents won't like you for a genetic hair colour departure from the ordinary (I just don't see it as a problem or defect at all), there are a zillion other things they won't like you for either.

Your boyfriend does not.", "You don't need people who don't like you because of the coloration of your hair in your life.  And if your bf thinks that his parents disliking someone because of her hair is OK -- and that their dislike is your fault because you should have hidden your hair --  I wonder what a life with him would be like.  \n\nThis interaction with Tom and his parents was extremely revealing.  What it revealed was truly terrible values and a failure of Tom to actually see his parents shortcomings objectively, or to accept you fully as you are, or to have your back.  It revealed superficiality and unkindness and duplicity.  \n\nYou deserve a man so much better than this.\n\nThe only thing that should be covered here is Tom's face.  In shame.  While he sits alone in his room because you've dumped him.\n\nNTA", "Uhhh NTA! I\u2019m genuinely surprised that some people have the audacity to speak this way? Like do they not hear themselves? Not liking someone because they have an uncontrollable condition such as this one, let alone your bf tolerating this behavior from his parents is so\u2026unsettling. Dead him sis", "op=NTA\n\nbut if your boyfriend has this attitude(SMH)---is that one you want to live with in the future. \n\nHis parents opinion is important in that it will always color future engagements/events.

I'd say yes", ">Third, his parents were out of line to dislike it\n\nNotably, it does not seem we have any convincing reason to believe they disliked it. I've been dying my hair all the colors of the rainbow (almost) since sixth grade, and some people just react like that to dyed hair, particularly if they're older and not really ever around dyed hair. (Obviously OP didn't dye her hair this way, but they may not have known that just looking at it, and I'd argue the immediate reaction would probably present the same anyway.)\n\nThe post only says that the BOYFRIEND, who has already thoroughly established himself as ~garbage~, claims they didn't like it. Their behavior seems to indicate that they took a moment to process it and then moved right along like perfectly normal, reasonable adults.", "People shouldn't need advance warning to know not to stare at someone, most of us learn that as a toddler.", "Not only that, but why hasn\u2019t bf sent a single picture of himself with his girlfriend to his parents in three years of dating?? Even without social media, my mom would have asked me to send pics now and then. Even before cell phones I could get my film developed and mail her pictures for like 25 cents.
