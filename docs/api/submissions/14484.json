I can't emphasize this enough! You should NEVER be asked to conceal something about yourself by someone who's supposed to love you! Frankly, your hair sounds cool.

His family\u2019s approval of you (or lack thereof) shouldn\u2019t be tied to your appearance, and your boyfriend should have your back, not caving to his family\u2019s judgmental ways. I would rethink whether you want to have a partner who makes you feel this way and doesn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA - THAT IS A HUGE RED FLAG!! You have a natural occurring skin condition, so why is that embarrassing or should be hidden? It's a part of who you are and something to own without feeling rejected by it.

No one has the right to police your body and appearance, including your boyfriend and his parents. \n\nOut of curiosity: Were the parents bold enough to ask about your hair, or did you volunteer any information about your condition? Even people who are judgmental about \"non-standard\" hair colors (which I think is shitty) would likely be more accepting if they knew it resulted from a medical condition. You just have to decide whether this level of judgmental/controlling behavior is something you want to put up with the rest of your life.", "NTA.

Your partner should be someone who will support and defend you, not shame you into covering up your body. It\u2019s also weird that his parents would care.

If they have a problem with that, that\u2019s on them but you should be with someone who\u2019ll defend you\n\nEdit for typos", "Who the FUCK are you hanging out with that can't handle hair? Why would you choose to spend time with these people? Are they/you all rich or something?", "NTA - You BF is afraid of his parents being judgmental over a medical condition!?  Why are you with someone who doesn't stand up for you?!  Red Flags all over on this.", "Ummm...WAT?!?! Lol, NTA, take your enviously chic natural hair and leave him, immediately!!!!", "It's literally something you can't control. Your bf is shaming your condition.

Wow, that is shallow of him and his parents. But he's the one that really matters. Now you know how he feels.", "NTA.\n\nI'm somewhere between baffled and wanting to laugh at your BF. They are upset about a skin/hair condition that is genetic? That you don't have much control over (I mean, I'm guessing you could color it if you wanted to, although I don't know if that would bother your skin)? \n\nI can't figure out how covering your hair would help. It's not something a lot of Western women do, so wouldn't that raise questions on its own?\n\nThis all makes no sense and I know there's more here between you but geez -- he sounds awful. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nTom sucks. \n\nAlso, I'm not clear about what you are describing. But that doesn't actually matter.", "INFO: You\u2019ve been dating for YEARS and they\u2019ve never even seen a picture of you?? This feels fake.", "Definitely NTA.

To hell with what he and his parents think.", "NTA\n\nFix him up by ending it with him.\n\nYour hair sounds cool. I have an extended family member with this and she rocks it. It's a part of her and she's never let it stand in her career or travelling the world. When explaining differences to my toddler we say \"if someone cannot fix it in 5 seconds, we don't mention it.\" Those things relate to food stuck in teeth or toilet paper on foot or tag labels still stuck on clothes. \n\nSome folks pay for highlights and you have one naturally.
