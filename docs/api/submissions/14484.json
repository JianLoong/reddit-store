I can't emphasize this enough! You should NEVER be asked to conceal something about yourself by someone who's supposed to love you! Frankly, your hair sounds cool. If he was concerned about his parents reaction, why didn't he explain it to them beforehand? If you've been dating for a few years, he's had plenty of time.

Maybe two years is enough for this one.", "NTA.

You don\u2019t need to cover it up to meet the parents.", "WTF? NTA so much. Half your head is white and therefore his parents don't like you and never will?\n\nFirst off, your hair sounds kinda awesome.\n\nSecond, bf was out of line to tell you to cover it.\n\nThird, his parents were out of line to dislike it.\n\nFourth, they all owe you an apology.", "NTA\n\nYou have a skin condition; he's a 27 Year old throwing a tantrum over parents disapproving of hair color you have no control over, SERIOUSLY?! How have you two been dating a few years and he's still unwilling to stand up for you?", "NTA. If you - the real you - is not acceptable, then covering parts of you up to make you acceptable to a bunch of judgmental ass-hats will not make you acceptable. As my kids like to say, \"You do you!\"", "NTA - it sounds like your boyfriend is ashamed of you or self conscious and rather shallow. His family\u2019s approval of you (or lack thereof) shouldn\u2019t be tied to your appearance, and your boyfriend should have your back, not caving to his family\u2019s judgmental ways. I would rethink whether you want to have a partner who makes you feel this way and doesn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA - THAT IS A HUGE RED FLAG!! You have a natural occurring skin condition, so why is that embarrassing or should be hidden? It's a part of who you are and something to own without feeling rejected by it. The fact that your partner would ask you to do that, especially at the last minute shows major insecurity on their part and it's definitely concerning. You do you girl!

I'll tell you; they're not people worth knowing, and neither is your boyfriend.\n\nDump him and find someone who actually loves you for you.", "NTA. If his parents don't like dyed hair good news, your hair isn't dyed. Regardless they should be able to judgement you on the person you are not your hair color. Tom should be supporting you because this isn't something you you can change. He should be supporting you even if you were dying your hair.", "NTA - if your BF is embarrassed by your natural appearance he doesn\u2019t respect you and he needs to go. I don\u2019t know how his parents could \u201cdisapprove\u201d of your relationship based on something so superficial but I\u2019d see this as a blessing in disguise. Break it off and the bullet is safely dodged.", "NTA\n\nWho cares about hair color? Esp since its from a natural condition. That's a pretty quick icebreaker--\"hey why is your hair white and black\"--\"oh this skin condition that causes my hair to turn white\"--\"oh interesting\".", "NTA \n\nThis is literally your natural hair, not some fashion trend.

You have been dating for a few years, how have the never seen pictures of you?", "NTA. No one has the right to police your body and appearance, including your boyfriend and his parents. \n\nOut of curiosity: Were the parents bold enough to ask about your hair, or did you volunteer any information about your condition? Even people who are judgmental about \"non-standard\" hair colors (which I think is shitty) would likely be more accepting if they knew it resulted from a medical condition. You just have to decide whether this level of judgmental/controlling behavior is something you want to put up with the rest of your life.", "NTA. If his parents don't like you based on your hair, they are horrible people. But, he's a crap boyfriend for even asking. He seems embarassed by you, and that is not okay.", "NTA\n\nBut Tom is certainly TA. So are his parents. You deserve better than this. Be kind to yourself and find someone who values ALL of you.", "NTA. if you had a skin condition like vitiligo, would he ask you to cover that up? if he doesn\u2019t want to show you off to your parents, awesome hair and all, then it\u2019s his loss (because that is so freaking cool dude your hair sounds amazing)", "NTA- He acted incredibly inappropriately. Your partner should be someone who will support and defend you, not shame you into covering up your body. It\u2019s also weird that his parents would care. Plenty of people have skin issues and other visible differences in appearances. If they have a problem with that, that\u2019s on them but you should be with someone who\u2019ll defend you\n\nEdit for typos", "Who the FUCK are you hanging out with that can't handle hair? Why would you choose to spend time with these people? Are they/you all rich or something?", "NTA - You BF is afraid of his parents being judgmental over a medical condition!?  Why are you with someone who doesn't stand up for you?!  Red Flags all over on this.", "Ummm...WAT?!?! Lol, NTA, take your enviously chic natural hair and leave him, immediately!!!!", "It's literally something you can't control. Your bf is shaming your condition. I'd think if his parents knew it was that and not just some \"look\" you were going for there wouldn't even be an issue from their side.", "NTA, your boyfriend is. I will say that may be he was stress because he introduced you to his parents, i'll give him that, but be careful about his behavior in the future, because what he did is very wrong", "NTA. Wow, that is shallow of him and his parents. But he's the one that really matters. Now you know how he feels.", "NTA.\n\nI'm somewhere between baffled and wanting to laugh at your BF. They are upset about a skin/hair condition that is genetic? That you don't have much control over (I mean, I'm guessing you could color it if you wanted to, although I don't know if that would bother your skin)? \n\nI can't figure out how covering your hair would help. It's not something a lot of Western women do, so wouldn't that raise questions on its own?\n\nThis all makes no sense and I know there's more here between you but geez -- he sounds awful. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nTom sucks. \n\nAlso, I'm not clear about what you are describing. But that doesn't actually matter.", "INFO: You\u2019ve been dating for YEARS and they\u2019ve never even seen a picture of you?? This feels fake.", "Definitely NTA. If I was your boyfriend, I would've been proud to show you around and if they question you, be honest and leave it as that. To hell with what he and his parents think.", "NTA\n\nFix him up by ending it with him.\n\nYour hair sounds cool. I have an extended family member with this and she rocks it. It's a part of her and she's never let it stand in her career or travelling the world. When explaining differences to my toddler we say \"if someone cannot fix it in 5 seconds, we don't mention it.\" Those things relate to food stuck in teeth or toilet paper on foot or tag labels still stuck on clothes. \n\nSome folks pay for highlights and you have one naturally. If he wants to cover you up now, then you can bet down the track he'd be demanding a veil that doesn't come off on your wedding day.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrop that AH.", "NTA Dump that zero", "NTA\n\nBut Tom & his family - oh boy! \n\nHe\u2019s 27 years old and he & his family can\u2019t handle \u201coh this. It\u2019s a fun lil genetic anomaly. Some people pay hundreds for a dye job like this that I got naturally.\u201d \n\nThat should be the end of it. No. A 27 year old & his parents can\u2019t handle something as simple as hair color and it will destroy any chance of a relationship between you & them. THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR.

What if something happens in the future that truly alters your appearance to be even more \u201cout of the norm\u201d? Imagine dealing with a life altering illness or injury and he & his parents are only concerned about how weird you look and how uncomfortable you make them?", "NTA;  You have poliosis;  WHY do you need to hide your natural appearance from others?
