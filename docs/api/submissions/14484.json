I can't emphasize this enough! You should NEVER be asked to conceal something about yourself by someone who's supposed to love you! Frankly, your hair sounds cool.

His family\u2019s approval of you (or lack thereof) shouldn\u2019t be tied to your appearance, and your boyfriend should have your back, not caving to his family\u2019s judgmental ways. I would rethink whether you want to have a partner who makes you feel this way and doesn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA - THAT IS A HUGE RED FLAG!! You have a natural occurring skin condition, so why is that embarrassing or should be hidden? It's a part of who you are and something to own without feeling rejected by it.

No one has the right to police your body and appearance, including your boyfriend and his parents. \n\nOut of curiosity: Were the parents bold enough to ask about your hair, or did you volunteer any information about your condition? Even people who are judgmental about \"non-standard\" hair colors (which I think is shitty) would likely be more accepting if they knew it resulted from a medical condition. You just have to decide whether this level of judgmental/controlling behavior is something you want to put up with the rest of your life.", "NTA.

Your partner should be someone who will support and defend you, not shame you into covering up your body. It\u2019s also weird that his parents would care.

If they have a problem with that, that\u2019s on them but you should be with someone who\u2019ll defend you\n\nEdit for typos", "Who the FUCK are you hanging out with that can't handle hair? Why would you choose to spend time with these people? Are they/you all rich or something?", "NTA - You BF is afraid of his parents being judgmental over a medical condition!?  Why are you with someone who doesn't stand up for you?!  Red Flags all over on this.", "Ummm...WAT?!?! Lol, NTA, take your enviously chic natural hair and leave him, immediately!!!!", "It's literally something you can't control. Your bf is shaming your condition.

Wow, that is shallow of him and his parents. But he's the one that really matters. Now you know how he feels.", "NTA.\n\nI'm somewhere between baffled and wanting to laugh at your BF. They are upset about a skin/hair condition that is genetic? That you don't have much control over (I mean, I'm guessing you could color it if you wanted to, although I don't know if that would bother your skin)? \n\nI can't figure out how covering your hair would help. It's not something a lot of Western women do, so wouldn't that raise questions on its own?\n\nThis all makes no sense and I know there's more here between you but geez -- he sounds awful. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nTom sucks. \n\nAlso, I'm not clear about what you are describing. But that doesn't actually matter.", "INFO: You\u2019ve been dating for YEARS and they\u2019ve never even seen a picture of you?? This feels fake.", "Definitely NTA.

To hell with what he and his parents think.", "NTA\n\nFix him up by ending it with him.\n\nYour hair sounds cool. I have an extended family member with this and she rocks it. It's a part of her and she's never let it stand in her career or travelling the world. When explaining differences to my toddler we say \"if someone cannot fix it in 5 seconds, we don't mention it.\" Those things relate to food stuck in teeth or toilet paper on foot or tag labels still stuck on clothes. \n\nSome folks pay for highlights and you have one naturally.

Should she have covered it on her wedding day?\n\nNTA, and dump the AH boyfriend.", "> He should\u2019ve told them in advance to prepare them so they didn\u2019t treat you like a creature at the zoo.\n\nPeople with manners don't need to be told such things in advance.  If anything, Tom should have told OP in advance that his parents are rude, bigoted assholes.", "Also\u2026 like - he could have just told them?? Like, if I want my parents to not be weird or judgey, I give a heads up to avoid awkwardness. \n\n(I.e. my friend coming to dinner uses they/them pronouns, so and so has a black eye from a fall - don\u2019t be weird, etc.)", "You have a magnificent opportunity if your natural hair color is darker to do fun colored highlights without bleaching! You could even do rainbow if you\u2019re game. I have light color hair and have always fantasized about this but it won\u2019t work for me unfortunately.", "Right? Its a medical condition so why not just tell ur folks ahead of time? No better to ask ur gf put on a wig so she can feel like shit.  /s ugh... what an idiot", "That struck me too - he asked while they were already in the car, on their way. Like, if he's been dating her for years at this point, and has always known his parents would probably have a problem with her hair, why on earth would he wait until almost the last possible moment to say something?", "> Notably, it does not seem we have any convincing reason to believe they disliked it.\n\nTom said he could tell they didn't like it, and he knows them better than OP does.  But he was probably projecting.  I'm guessing *he* doesn't like it, maybe because OP attracts too much attention?  Lots of men don't like that at all.  Maybe his plan is eventually to try to shame her into dying her hair so it looks \"normal\".", "Sorry, need to respond to this, and maybe give a light caution to watch throwing around the word 'older' and misconceptions of how 'older' people are. I'm pushing 70, grew up in the 50s and every female relative of mine, including my mother, grandmother and all my 'older' aunts, dyed their hair. Even my father started when he was in his 50s. I started coloring my hair when I was 15 and never stopped. AND I have an arm and back full of tattoos I started getting just 3 years ago. It's not cool anymore to stereotype 'older' people. I doubt that's the issue. If bf's  parents truly DO have an issue with OP then they're just weird af.", "No no no, it's tinsel or glitter!\n\nI'll never dye my grays away!", "My mother calls hers \"blonde highlights\".", "You\u2019re right. My dads girlfriend at 15 pierced his ears 3 times for him and he had long shoulder length died bright red hair. He\u2019s pushing 70.", "Solid, sad points.", "I had blue hair when I was in college.  When I was supposed to meet my GFs parents, she asked if I could cover it with a hat or something.  I said I could.  I tell my roommate that my GF wanted me to cover my hair so what should I go with, the pimp hat or the paper bag with eyeholes cut out? My roommate not missing a beat says \"A pimp hat is completely inappropriate for meeting a girl's parents.  I'd go with the paper bag.\"\n\nNeedless to say my GF was not pleased with me when I showed up at her parents' house.  The parents seemed a little shocked but thought it was hilarious once I explained what was going on and no, they didn't have a problem with my hair being blue.", "Oh that\u2019s golden! Or chrome rather. :)", "Oh dang! That\u2019s even better, thank you! I\u2019m looking forward to thinking of that tomorrow morning when I\u2019m fixing my hair. :)", "I\u2019m 33 and have a solid grey streak at my temple. So I dye it lavender, to make it pop more."]}
