You\u2019re trying your best to find a compromise that works for both of you, while your BF is only happy if things are done HIS way. He needs to learn that relationships don\u2019t work like that.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I are cyclists. I can outride her. It was less fun having to go slow so she can keep up so she bought an e-bike and it's great. We can both ride together and get similar fitness benefits. I love it!\n\nYour fiance is a complete jerk.

The logical thing to do when you want to do something together that one of you is better at is to give the other person a reasonable way to participate. Golf? There's a ladies' tee and handicaps. Video games? You get the powered-up character, I get the enchanted bunny. Poker? You get three times the chips, etc etc\n\nIf he only wants to do this with you while he can be obviously superior, then don't do this together at all.

Not nice or loving.

Imo it is a good idea for you to ebike on trails you'd otherwise struggle on, and it is still riding a bike. Some riders are purists and anti-ebikes. Some of this is down to perceived or actual thoughtlessness of ebikers, but I doubt you fall into this category. He needs to appreciate you sharing in his hobby, realise it's meant to be fun for you too, and tone it down a bit when riding with you.

Like it's hard to tell the pace when somebody is pedaling slowly but the bike is zooming. Then you randomly will see somebody going like 20 mi an hour out of a path which is dangerous again because it's unpredictable and maybe this is what he means by disrespect...

I'm a middle-aged, overweight woman who commutes to work wearing a dress and riding an e-bike that has an upright seating position and a gloriously oversized basket on the front.

It\u2019s common courtesy for cycling group rides to establish a distance and pace. Then everyone rides at that pace. If people can\u2019t or won\u2019t ride at that pace, either because they are faster or slower, then they ride with a different group. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being slower - there\u2019s even a term for rides that go at the slowest rider\u2019s pace - \u2018no drops\u2019 and \u2018party pace\u2019. \n\nYour bf sounds like a Cat 3 poser, who is living out his Tour de France dreams by beating his gf on the local lap.

You're not there to become a mountain bike cyclist or whatever it's called, you're there to spend time with him. If he really wanted you to get good at the sport, then he should have made his expectations clear and started you on an easier trail.", "NTA, but your future husband is quite competitive. Did you tell him that you got the bike to spend time with him, not to beat him in anything? Ask him directly if he wants you to come with him. If he says yes, tell him you are respecting the sport, but you can't keep up with him because he has much better training and like that it's fun and you are training too.

Though I can cycle for kilometres at a stretch, I can't walk uphill without my heart coming out of my mouth every 30 seconds.

I have my commuter bike for getting around (I don't even own a car), and my gravel bike for leisure rides, and I've just finished sorting out my bikepacking setup for more multi day trips. This is to say, I take my cycling semi-seriously.\nMy mam has just bought an electric bike so we can do some cycling trips together. To me, this is a fantastic way to make it feasible for her to join me on rides she couldn't otherwise manage. I can't stand cyclists who decide that ebikes are \"cheating\" somehow. He is being ludicrous.\n\nNTA of course", "NTA, tell him you are doing it to spend time with him, not to push yourself to the point of misery, and if he is miserable going up the hills then he can buy an ebike too. Maybe once your fitness improves you can go out on a regular bike but for now he is being unreasonable expecting you to keep up with his pace.", "NTA. He's an athlete at this sport. You're an amateur. An e-bike allows you to spend time doing an activity together despite you not being at the same level. And you shouldn't have to be at the same level to enjoy things together.", "Nta. This is hilarious. Respect his sport... What the hell. \n\nMy wife has an ebike because I do multiple hour rides at a fairly hard pace. So we needed something to make a ride fun for both of us. \n\nWhen we ride together I get to ride at a moderate pace (ebikes limited to 25kph here) and really hammer it on the hills to keep up. Ends up being a decent workout for me and her!", "Nta. Does he want you to suffer  or does he want company?", "NTA\n\nSo this was never about spending time with you?\n\nHe won\u2019t slow down, he won\u2019t let you keep up the way you need to. What\u2019s his real problem here?", "NTA, people love to gatekeep their hobbies for some reason. Seems like you just wanted to be able to enjoy spending time with him doing what he loves. A more appropriate response would have been for him to be happy you found a solution to not really liking the biking too much.", "NTA\n\nI always assumed there are unspoken rules in such situations, like:\n\n- in communal outings (biking, running, hiking etc) the slowest person sets the pace - it's just a matter of safety and avoiding injuries,\n\n- you don't compete with novices - it's weird, hurtful and actually risks injuries as well,\n\n- you may need to separate 'companionship' sessions and training tempo sessions, and that's okay, because people are different, at no time you should push your pace on another person, unless you specifically agreed on a competitive run,\n\n- most importantly, you do not expect the devotion to your favorite sport from other people.\n\nIt's very weird that he was pushing his tempo at you and making you miserable. There may be a small failure to communicate from your side - if you didn't tell him anything about being miserable on the rides. But in general, the whole situation could be summed up with 'I don't like biking, but I like spending time with you' - and there nothing wrong with it.\n\nI like running and my wife doesn't, and I may spend 2-3 hours on a trail run. So I was perfectly okay when she accompanied me on a bike, and it would be a weird take to get offended that she 'disrespects my sport' by that.", "NTA but listen to his advice on changing gears - it's all about keeping your legs pumping at a steady cadence no matter what the terrain is.  I see a lot of people struggle because they are climbing in the wrong gear.", "Like, my husband is pushing to get me an ebike so we can play together. No one is frustrated and we get to stay together. Why would he complain at all. Ego problem, my guess.", "NTA. There are three solutions here:\n\n1. He finds a pace/loop you can handle so you can keep up.\n\n2. He accepts your ebike so you can keep up on routes that are too tough for you.\n\n3. He goes back to biking by himself.\n\nOr, I guess:\n\n4. He also gets an ebike.\n\nAs someone who enjoys teaching others my own hobbies, one of the most important things is easing people into it. If someone wants to get into D&D, I don\u2019t throw them onto a complex, 3 wave encounter that will require them to use all of their spells optimally. If I want to get someone into jazz music, I don\u2019t immediately throw John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cA Love Supreme\u201d at them (great album, but definitely a lot to process all at once). \n\nIf he wants you to join him, he has to make some kind of concession to the fact that you\u2019re not as strong of a rider compared to him.", "NTA.", "Lol OP will literally do anything but admit they are out of shape and don\u2019t want to workout.", "NTA. I'm a big cyclist and I wish my wife wanted to get an ebike to keep up with me on long rides. As it is she has a road bike and we sometimes go for short rides together, but we both know she doesn't want to ride 100km with me on the weekends and I don't expect her to. I've talked to other cyclists whose partners use ebikes for this and they all say it's great. Your fiance's ego just sounds a little bruised.", "NTA. I have an ebike, husband has a regular one. Same issues. He doesn't mind at all. In fact, he's getting his own ebike so we can take more long distance rides and also use our car less for grocery trips or quick trips around town.", "NTA\n\nCome on, this is the standard combination nowadays, husband or boyfriend on normal bike, wife or girlfriend on e-bike, and it\u2019s wonderful \ud83e\udd70", "ESH or NAH. I see your point, he's asking too much from a newbie and can't remember how tough it can be when starting out on a new exercise regime, but I also see his point, he's in it for the exercise and self-improvement and wanted to share that with you, and instead of working on improving your muscles and stamina you've bought a short-cut that lets you 'glide up hills with no effort'. You interpreted his suggestion as a pure request for company, and if you were correct then you could have ridden a motorbike and it wouldn't matter, whereas he intended it to be about shared experiences with pure physicality; this was fundamentally an issue of communication, and your expectations were misaligned. He definitely comes across as being overly melodramatic with his wording, but he's not wrong that somewhere along the line communication on this topic has failed. There is no healthy way forward without a discussion about how to align your expectations; if you don't want to push yourself with biking, it may be that a compromise is that you have occasional 'hang-out' bike rides with the e-bike but that his 'constitutional' bike rides he finds other like-minded cyclists for", "NTA Does he keep you company in your solo pursuits?  He's using you because he doesn't know how to be alone with his thoughts.  My ex took me biking and on the first ride, he said, \"Wow you are out of shape.\"  At this time I was regularly hiking 10+ miles often.  Biking is different and he gave you no grace.  My ex was abusive and this was an early sign.  He's a jagoff.", "NTA", "NAH - I can see validity in both of your points. I believe the answer is going on bike rides, serious push yourself bike rides just isn't something you do together.", "Cute", "I\u2019d say NAH. I think you should have run the idea by him before going out and buying the e-bike. While it sounds like a reasonable solution, I also understand why it wouldn\u2019t be appealing to him \u2014 it sounds like he enjoys the camaraderie of working through a tough climb together, and one party just sailing through would diminish that experience for him.", "NTA and don't book that wedding venue quite yet. Let this thread ripen up and walk through it with him to see if 100 people can persuade him of what 1 can't.\n\nHe lost his riding buddy and tried to jam you in that role because it filled a need for him. You were perfectly happy staying home and recharging your introvert self.\n\nHe failed to adjust his rides to let you condition up and ignored your OUTSTANDING logic that \"you can't teach muscles and breath capacity when it doesn't exist yet.\"\n\nHe got pissy when you found a very elegant ebike solution because apparently it WASN'T about spending time together and talking. It was about doing things exactly the way he wanted to do them.\n\nSo look. This is a real self absorbed guy who wants you to support him in doing exactly what he wants they way he wants to do it. He doesn't actually care about whether you enjoyed his rides- he was enjoying them and that should be good enough.\n\nMy brother is this guy. Outside of his exercise blindness he's actually an awesome guy and my sister-in-law has been very happy being married to him but she ACCEPTS NO BULLSHIT. She sticks up for herself like Atilla The Hun is at the door- because he is. She doesn't give in an inch to his exercise or activity bullshit or worry for a second about meeting his needs because he sure as shit isn't worrying about meeting hers.  Decide how many ebike rides a month you would enjoy and tell him you're available for exactly that many- and that he needs to stop the damn pouting and go join a big boy riding club.", "> why should his enjoyment hinge on you suffering through something you don't enjoy\n\nThis kind of made me think of the Goldeneye Retro Replay episode where Troy Baker played it a lot as a kid and was having a blast obliterating Nolan North but Nolan wasn\u2019t enjoying it because Troy wasn\u2019t giving him a chance to actually learn the game. They actually had a pretty in depth and mature discussion about it on the show at the time.", "> I dare him to go to a cycling forum and whine about you being on an e-bike. He'll get roasted.\n\nIdk, people these days gatekeep everything, so it's possible for the fiance to find someone like him. \n\nOP, all you need to do is have a conversation with him about this, and let him pick one: be a dick and ride alone, or compromise and ride with you.

There's some really nice cycling where we are, but there's a lot of killer hills. I love downhill, but going up is an issue!", "Taking the most generous interpretation, it could just be that he doesn't realise the gulf in ability. Like he doesn't realise that you don't just get that much better at cycling by doing it a few times, and it's not just something that can be taught.\n\nLike it's possible that he doesn't realise how good he is at cycling compared to someone who is just starting out. My Dad has always been kind of like this. He never realised that things that were easy for him were difficult for me.", "I like you.

He asked for her company, not for a competition.", "Exactly. You choose a route that suits the less experienced/less fit rider. Or hiker. Or runner.

She found a solution that allowed her to keep up with him, and suddenly he's unhappy about that? \n\nSeems to me like watching her struggle and/or feeling superior to her was part of the appeal.", "NTA \n\nI'm so fucking confused - the ebike seems like a perfect compromise! \n\nI'm a runner, and if I was in this situation, I would be **elated** to have my partner figure out an **accommodation** that still has them join me without being in pain!   If I'm running an 8 min/mile and my partner can only do a 10min/mile, I would be so happy if they got a bike, and **CHOSE to be with me, in a way that still allowed me to enjoy my sport** to the best of my ability because Im the one that cares about the sport in the first place!", "I love mountain biking and my partner hates it, so he bought an e-bike to be able to come with me.
