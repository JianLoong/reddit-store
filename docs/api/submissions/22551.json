I thought it would be nice to hang out for a while and said I said I would try it, but it ended up being really hard and I was not in the proper shape to do the loop he wanted. He kept telling me to change my gears and tried to teach me, which could have been sweet, but was mostly annoying because you can't teach muscles and breath capacity when it doesn't exist yet.\n\nWe tried a couple more times but both of us got increasingly frustrated because I couldn't keep up and I wasn't having a good time and he wanted me to be having a good time and keeping up with him. I decided to buy an e-bike so he could have company and I could do exercise I like at other times and when it came, I was excited to use it and we went on a ride. I thought it was great because I could go the right speed and keep a conversation, but now he's upset because he feels like I don't respect his sport and am not trying to get better at it, and he finds it demoralizing that he's pushing up a hill and I'm just gliding up with no effort.\n\nWe had a fight about it and he feels like I shouldn't just have bought a bike and if I really hated doing it that much I should have said something, but I felt like I could afford the e-bike and I like hanging out with him and I don't understand the problem. AITA?\n\nEdits:\n\nWe do lots of things I like together as well, like watch the shows I love and go on night walks together (which are my favorite). I know this really didn't show the whole relationship but we are definitely in love and this was not some weird attempt for him to change my body  \n\nAlso, we had a better talk once both of us felt better and were not immediately feeling hurt and tldr he likes having someone to be able to talk about the challenging parts of the ride and check progress with which I think is just not going to be my role given that I like biking fine but don't love it the way he does. We've decided to enjoy chill street biking together on weekends to go places we like in the city but he's going to find more serious bikers to do his 10+ mile hill bikes with.

The logical thing to do when you want to do something together that one of you is better at is to give the other person a reasonable way to participate. Golf? There's a ladies' tee and handicaps.

Imo it is a good idea for you to ebike on trails you'd otherwise struggle on, and it is still riding a bike. Some riders are purists and anti-ebikes. Some of this is down to perceived or actual thoughtlessness of ebikers, but I doubt you fall into this category.

I'm a middle-aged, overweight woman who commutes to work wearing a dress and riding an e-bike that has an upright seating position and a gloriously oversized basket on the front.

It\u2019s common courtesy for cycling group rides to establish a distance and pace. Then everyone rides at that pace. If people can\u2019t or won\u2019t ride at that pace, either because they are faster or slower, then they ride with a different group. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being slower - there\u2019s even a term for rides that go at the slowest rider\u2019s pace - \u2018no drops\u2019 and \u2018party pace\u2019. \n\nYour bf sounds like a Cat 3 poser, who is living out his Tour de France dreams by beating his gf on the local lap.

You're not there to become a mountain bike cyclist or whatever it's called, you're there to spend time with him. If he really wanted you to get good at the sport, then he should have made his expectations clear and started you on an easier trail.", "NTA, but your future husband is quite competitive. Did you tell him that you got the bike to spend time with him, not to beat him in anything? Ask him directly if he wants you to come with him. If he says yes, tell him you are respecting the sport, but you can't keep up with him because he has much better training and like that it's fun and you are training too.

Though I can cycle for kilometres at a stretch, I can't walk uphill without my heart coming out of my mouth every 30 seconds.

I have my commuter bike for getting around (I don't even own a car), and my gravel bike for leisure rides, and I've just finished sorting out my bikepacking setup for more multi day trips. This is to say, I take my cycling semi-seriously.\nMy mam has just bought an electric bike so we can do some cycling trips together. To me, this is a fantastic way to make it feasible for her to join me on rides she couldn't otherwise manage. I can't stand cyclists who decide that ebikes are \"cheating\" somehow. He is being ludicrous.\n\nNTA of course", "NTA, tell him you are doing it to spend time with him, not to push yourself to the point of misery, and if he is miserable going up the hills then he can buy an ebike too. Maybe once your fitness improves you can go out on a regular bike but for now he is being unreasonable expecting you to keep up with his pace.", "NTA. He's an athlete at this sport. You're an amateur. An e-bike allows you to spend time doing an activity together despite you not being at the same level. And you shouldn't have to be at the same level to enjoy things together.", "Nta. This is hilarious. Respect his sport... What the hell. \n\nMy wife has an ebike because I do multiple hour rides at a fairly hard pace. So we needed something to make a ride fun for both of us. \n\nWhen we ride together I get to ride at a moderate pace (ebikes limited to 25kph here) and really hammer it on the hills to keep up. Ends up being a decent workout for me and her!", "Nta. Does he want you to suffer  or does he want company?", "NTA\n\nSo this was never about spending time with you?\n\nHe won\u2019t slow down, he won\u2019t let you keep up the way you need to. What\u2019s his real problem here?", "NTA, people love to gatekeep their hobbies for some reason. Seems like you just wanted to be able to enjoy spending time with him doing what he loves. A more appropriate response would have been for him to be happy you found a solution to not really liking the biking too much.", "NTA\n\nI always assumed there are unspoken rules in such situations, like:\n\n- in communal outings (biking, running, hiking etc) the slowest person sets the pace - it's just a matter of safety and avoiding injuries,\n\n- you don't compete with novices - it's weird, hurtful and actually risks injuries as well,\n\n- you may need to separate 'companionship' sessions and training tempo sessions, and that's okay, because people are different, at no time you should push your pace on another person, unless you specifically agreed on a competitive run,\n\n- most importantly, you do not expect the devotion to your favorite sport from other people.\n\nIt's very weird that he was pushing his tempo at you and making you miserable. There may be a small failure to communicate from your side - if you didn't tell him anything about being miserable on the rides. But in general, the whole situation could be summed up with 'I don't like biking, but I like spending time with you' - and there nothing wrong with it.\n\nI like running and my wife doesn't, and I may spend 2-3 hours on a trail run. So I was perfectly okay when she accompanied me on a bike, and it would be a weird take to get offended that she 'disrespects my sport' by that.", "NTA but listen to his advice on changing gears - it's all about keeping your legs pumping at a steady cadence no matter what the terrain is.  I see a lot of people struggle because they are climbing in the wrong gear.", "Like, my husband is pushing to get me an ebike so we can play together. No one is frustrated and we get to stay together. Why would he complain at all. Ego problem, my guess.", "NTA. There are three solutions here:\n\n1. He finds a pace/loop you can handle so you can keep up.\n\n2. He accepts your ebike so you can keep up on routes that are too tough for you.\n\n3. He goes back to biking by himself.\n\nOr, I guess:\n\n4. He also gets an ebike.\n\nAs someone who enjoys teaching others my own hobbies, one of the most important things is easing people into it. If someone wants to get into D&D, I don\u2019t throw them onto a complex, 3 wave encounter that will require them to use all of their spells optimally. If I want to get someone into jazz music, I don\u2019t immediately throw John Coltrane\u2019s \u201cA Love Supreme\u201d at them (great album, but definitely a lot to process all at once). \n\nIf he wants you to join him, he has to make some kind of concession to the fact that you\u2019re not as strong of a rider compared to him.", "NTA.", "Lol OP will literally do anything but admit they are out of shape and don\u2019t want to workout.", "NTA. I'm a big cyclist and I wish my wife wanted to get an ebike to keep up with me on long rides. As it is she has a road bike and we sometimes go for short rides together, but we both know she doesn't want to ride 100km with me on the weekends and I don't expect her to. I've talked to other cyclists whose partners use ebikes for this and they all say it's great. Your fiance's ego just sounds a little bruised.", "NTA. I have an ebike, husband has a regular one. Same issues. He doesn't mind at all. In fact, he's getting his own ebike so we can take more long distance rides and also use our car less for grocery trips or quick trips around town.", "NTA\n\nCome on, this is the standard combination nowadays, husband or boyfriend on normal bike, wife or girlfriend on e-bike, and it\u2019s wonderful \ud83e\udd70", "ESH or NAH. I see your point, he's asking too much from a newbie and can't remember how tough it can be when starting out on a new exercise regime, but I also see his point, he's in it for the exercise and self-improvement and wanted to share that with you, and instead of working on improving your muscles and stamina you've bought a short-cut that lets you 'glide up hills with no effort'. You interpreted his suggestion as a pure request for company, and if you were correct then you could have ridden a motorbike and it wouldn't matter, whereas he intended it to be about shared experiences with pure physicality; this was fundamentally an issue of communication, and your expectations were misaligned. He definitely comes across as being overly melodramatic with his wording, but he's not wrong that somewhere along the line communication on this topic has failed. There is no healthy way forward without a discussion about how to align your expectations; if you don't want to push yourself with biking, it may be that a compromise is that you have occasional 'hang-out' bike rides with the e-bike but that his 'constitutional' bike rides he finds other like-minded cyclists for", "NTA Does he keep you company in your solo pursuits?  He's using you because he doesn't know how to be alone with his thoughts.  My ex took me biking and on the first ride, he said, \"Wow you are out of shape.\"  At this time I was regularly hiking 10+ miles often.  Biking is different and he gave you no grace.  My ex was abusive and this was an early sign.  He's a jagoff.", "NTA", "NAH - I can see validity in both of your points. I believe the answer is going on bike rides, serious push yourself bike rides just isn't something you do together.", "Cute", "I\u2019d say NAH. I think you should have run the idea by him before going out and buying the e-bike. While it sounds like a reasonable solution, I also understand why it wouldn\u2019t be appealing to him \u2014 it sounds like he enjoys the camaraderie of working through a tough climb together, and one party just sailing through would diminish that experience for him.", "NTA and don't book that wedding venue quite yet. Let this thread ripen up and walk through it with him to see if 100 people can persuade him of what 1 can't.\n\nHe lost his riding buddy and tried to jam you in that role because it filled a need for him. You were perfectly happy staying home and recharging your introvert self.\n\nHe failed to adjust his rides to let you condition up and ignored your OUTSTANDING logic that \"you can't teach muscles and breath capacity when it doesn't exist yet.\"\n\nHe got pissy when you found a very elegant ebike solution because apparently it WASN'T about spending time together and talking. It was about doing things exactly the way he wanted to do them.\n\nSo look. This is a real self absorbed guy who wants you to support him in doing exactly what he wants they way he wants to do it. He doesn't actually care about whether you enjoyed his rides- he was enjoying them and that should be good enough.\n\nMy brother is this guy. Outside of his exercise blindness he's actually an awesome guy and my sister-in-law has been very happy being married to him but she ACCEPTS NO BULLSHIT. She sticks up for herself like Atilla The Hun is at the door- because he is. She doesn't give in an inch to his exercise or activity bullshit or worry for a second about meeting his needs because he sure as shit isn't worrying about meeting hers.  Decide how many ebike rides a month you would enjoy and tell him you're available for exactly that many- and that he needs to stop the damn pouting and go join a big boy riding club.", "> why should his enjoyment hinge on you suffering through something you don't enjoy\n\nThis kind of made me think of the Goldeneye Retro Replay episode where Troy Baker played it a lot as a kid and was having a blast obliterating Nolan North but Nolan wasn\u2019t enjoying it because Troy wasn\u2019t giving him a chance to actually learn the game.

The point of that type of activity is that you are sharing in the struggle. Imagine going to the gym with a friend... only they show up in Ironman armor and toss weights around like they're nothing.

You\u2019re allowed to not like all the same things or have the same capabilities and that\u2019s ok.

We were all at VERY different levels, but that's fine. Some of us were training muscle ups, others were doing negative only pullups. We could all hang out and have fun though, doesn't matter if my reps are super hard or super easy compared to what someone else is doing, we all just show up and do what's needed given our level.\n\nBiking is fucked that way though, the difficulty slider is set by the terrain much more so, so there's not so much a way to be inclusive of someone at a different level. Seems to me there's only two options even. Either you do his usual route with a bike that acts like a weight band in pullups (something that makes it easy enough for you to keep up) or he does an easier route with you with a generator attached to the front wheel or something else to artificially make it harder for him while you're using a normal bike.\n\nEither way, I don't think there's another option. I personally think it's really worthwhile to find a way to be inclusive with working out, otherwise you're a wall for people wanting to join you instead of a bridge. After all, if your boyfriend's supportive and this becomes a regular thing, maybe five years from now you don't even need the extra help and you'll both be more or less at the same level. If he discourages you now though, that'll never happen. It's kind of sad.\n\nYou're NTA OP. This sounds like something that should have an easy solution... sorry your boyfriend's got some weird hangups about it.

He should be happy you compromised and are keeping him company. I would have just quit lol", "You definitely don\u2019t respect him. I mean how dare you go above and beyond doing an activity you don\u2019t love, spending all that money and trying to be supportive of the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to be alone and finding a great way to support his pleasure when you already have your own. So very disrespectful. I\u2019m appalled at you.", "Hard core cyclists don\u2019t care for e-bikes. NTA. Tell him that\u2019s how he gets to ride with you", "NTA. The only other option was you figure out what your distance is, and turn around at that point while he continues. As each week went by, you would hang longer and in a matter of months you would be there. \n\nBut that sounds frustrating. So your compromise was fine. He is judging you for your level of stamina. Do NOT have kids with him.

You decide you want to work up to where he is, and either you train up alone or he agrees to slow down or go on shorter routes that you can handle.\n\n3.  You both accept that this is simply not a hobby that you can share.\n\nThis seems like a silly argument, but if you are intending to get married to this person, you need to make sure you can have a rational conversation (not when you're already out biking) and come to a solution that you're both ok with.

OP, could you maybe go riding yourself for a bit to try & get stronger? This way you could eventually ride typical bikes together.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nbut you both need to communicate to each other. \n\nInstead of huffing and puffing he needs to communicate why this bothers him so much. as someone else said, why do you HAVE to suffer while doing this, for it to be fun? \n\nAnd you should have communicated that you were struggling and couldn\u2019t continue to go at this pace before buying the e-bike. It\u2019s clear you were frustrated from the very first bike ride. Just take the time and explain that this was hard for you and something you weren\u2019t just going to get magically better at, you had to practice. So he either needs to slow down his pace so you can practice or get okay with the e-bike.", "NTA. Is his bike festooned with a giant red flag? If not, it should be. This is weirdly controlling.

Sharing his ease as well as struggles.", "I've been cycling my whole life. I tried to get my wife into it but it didn't work because I was into fast road training and she was on a mt bike. So we compromised. I put wide, road tires on her mt bike and I bought a hybrid with slower gearing and a more upright position so it would force me to slow down.  I absolutely hated it but did it anyway since we got to spend time together and later with our kids. Eventually she just didn't take to cycling and gave it up...but at least we tried.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s a great compromise.

No use him getting mad at you for it.", "NTA you tried it out and it wasn't for you and now you made an effort to still be able to share with him without you having to suffer through something you don't enjoy. \n\nYou could maybe use the assist function to still get a bit of a workout and maybe even build more resistance overtime. I can see him maybe wanting to also share the pain with someone else as it were. Like bonding over the energy spent type of thing but again to me this is optional. \n\nI think you can say that you tried the sport and it wasn't for you but that you want to still spend time and share the sport to some degree with him and this is why you went the ebike route.", "NTA, he's just a little disappointed you're not into the same thing as him, its totally normal (not worth fighting over maybe). If I may suggest slight \"manhandling\" as my wife would call it (we read this together) and let him know you love cycling with him and its not about the respect of the sport or him, its just that you're not as good as him at it and need help keeping up, and I mean actually phrase it like that, he'll suddenly feel more man as he thinks it may just be he's that good that your not slow, he's just fast... I suspect he won't be as bothered after.\n\nIf not, just don't join him.", "Nta. Tell him to find another bike partner", "NTA. Get a better fianc\u00e9, this one\u2019s an idiot.", "NTA. My wife and I are the same. I love cycling and will go as often as possible and would love for my wife to join me, but she isn\u2019t cycling fit and is over a ride as soon as we hit the first hill.

Riding with friends is for pleasure and can't happen if we can't keep the same pace. I thinks it's really cool that you found a way that you could be there without breaking up the intensity of his workout. Your guy just needs to remember *he's* there to get his workout and tune his body, *as well as* share time with someone he cares about; it sounds like you're there to enjoy the company of someone about, and you get your workouts in elsewhere, doing your own thing at your own pace. The important thing he needs is to remember he invited you along to spend time with and share it with you, not to compete with you. The whole reason he invited you along wasn't to see who could go up the hill with the least effort; it was to ride bikes together, lol. This is all silly and it sounds like he's taking his workouts a lil too seriously if you thinks you need to be competing with him.

Later, around the corner she slowed down quite a bit, so I tried to catch her but I only had about 1% more to give and as soon as she saw me slowly coming back to her, she upped the battery power and disappeared over the summit like a mirage. LOL That was the first time I\u2019ve been wasted by a granny.", "It is something that HE didn't communicate!", "Thanks for the laugh!", "With an ebike she will still get in shape, just a little more slowly.  Nothing wrong with that.", "Yeah.  Why can't the BF be happy like your dad?", "I am quite happy that others get to enjoy the fun of a bike ride thanks to an e-bike, for myself I am resisting with all my strength the switch to an e-bike (I am now on the age downslope and my body is starting to tell me to take a hike). I love the physical effort and I do think that I would be cheating.", "He's looking at this all wrong.  He could just draft her on the e-bike for the entire ride and bring his average speed up to show off to his friends.", "I get the impression that BF wants her to WORK, not have fun!", "I completely agree with this perspective, and I also believe it's important to consider the dynamics between partners. \n\nI used to follow a vlogger who considered his daily workout routine in his home gym to be essential. However, as his daughter reached the toddler stage, finding time for his workout sets became challenging. Since his job primarily allowed him to work from home while his wife's job didn't, he took on the majority of child responsibilities. Initially, he would distract his daughter with activities she enjoyed to create time for his workouts. But eventually, she used to follow him to his gym and insisted on participating. So, he modified some of his cardio exercises to be kid-friendly. For example, instead of running on the treadmil (because if he does, his daughter would insist on running on it with him), they started running up and down the stairs until she grew tired. Afterward, she would go to her room to rest or engage in easier activities, allowing him to continue with the rest of his workouts. These adjustments not only helped him stay active but also created special moments with his daughter. \n\nI believe that it's these kinds of adaptations that can strengthen and enhance relationships.", "Man I\u2019m so sad that channel died. I know that technically it still exists but it\u2019s not Retro Replay anymore and as far as I know both Troy and Nolan aren\u2019t on it anymore? It was such a blast", "I always got the vibe that Troy takes himself waayyy too seriously but I used to brush it off. I was excited to find retro replay at first but it didn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s such an insufferable, smug brat. I still watched for Nolan but seeing him get quieter and more frustrated with every video was rough.\n\nBut yeah, that\u2019s a great example of an obsessively competitive sore winner.", "The thing is, OP sounds athletic and could probably be good/enjoy the sport, but her boyfriend is pushing her to keep up with him and ruining it for her. It's so unfortunate.", "> As someone who\u2019s ridden with slow folks, it\u2019s not an option. Part of biking distances is getting up to speed. Having to slow down and lose momentum can be straight up painful, both physically and mentally. I definitely couldn\u2019t ride with OP, but I wouldn\u2019t ask her a second time, either.\n\nTo an extent, sure. If you're climbing, it can be painful if you don't have the gearing to maintain a good cadence at slower speeds. Riding slower is usually more uncomfortable because you're putting more weight on the saddle and your hands, but at the same time, if I'm riding with a beginner or someone slower, I'm going to go on a 15 - 20 mile ride with them, not a 60+ mile ride like I'd do with a faster group so comfort will never become an issue.\n\nSo yes, if you're doing long rides with slower people, then it can definitely get uncomfortable if you're not used to the speed. \n\nBut most beginners aren't going on 60 mile rides, and I'm sure you can do a 20 mile ride at a slower pace if you can do long distance rides.", "Love this! When I got into crossfit I had a friend similarly \u201cshow me the ropes\u201d and also prioritize their workout. Never once did my friends expect me to bust out pullups fight off the hop or do wods rx. Much easier to modify individual activities to physical capability but the general principle of newbies starting slow should be universal for all sports. I would be very curious to see him attempt say a muscle up with rings from gymnastics (one of the most advanced exercises. The male gymnasts do it at the Olympics but for some reason it isn't a skill for women gymnastics). Bonus points if you get mad at him when he fails and tell him he isn't a real gymnyst is he modifies to his ability. I think I may be ta here for wanting to be a fly on the wall for that lol.", "I think he's upset because he wanted to \"teach\" her how to ride a bike and he can't do that if she doesn't struggle.", "I'm sorry, how is it valid to get angry about *someone else's* workout?", "> Normally I'd agree with you but I've met enough spandex warriors to confidently say that a lot of them genuinely think people using an ebike is \"cheating\" and disrespectful.\n\nAs a spandex warrior and MAMIL, this is spot on. I think e-bikes are awesome, but the hate for them in the community is insane.", "> I got a comment once for wearing mountain bike shorts and riding my road bike.\n\nLOL What?! That's so weird!", "You say it lessens the experience for her partner, but it ENHANCES her experience.\n\nHe hasn't really told her what he would like in a biking partner so she thought keeping up with him was the main goal.\n\nYou sound very bent out of shape about an e-bike.  Take a breath.", "Good questions.  I wonder if you will get a serious reply.", "NTA I cycle commute and I\u2019m not that slow, but when I\u2019m with friends we go at the slowest persons pace, and never put them at the back of the group. It\u2019s supposed to be fun.", "I am an avid cyclist and I've been married for 30 years. I wish that my wife would buy an e-bike in order to ride with me. I think you did a sweet and wonderful thing", "NTA. So he doesn\u2019t care when you put yourself through pain for him but when you try to remove that pain and still spend time with him, he can\u2019t take it because his ego is too fragile.", "NTA, spent my entire working life in the bicycle industry. E-bikes are bicycles, and anyone who yhinks they are disrespectful to cycling are gate keeping something that should be available to everyone. If an e-bike gets you out, it\u2019s a good thing and anyone who says otherwise is a hater.", "Some cyclists are such AHs. How is spending a good chunk of cash on an e-bike disrespecting his sport. You respect it so much you found a way and willingly spent a lot of money to keep yourself involved in his rides. You should tell him you are supporting him and you want to spend time together, and that unfortunately in this sport, he is the athlete and you are his fan aka you simply cannot keep up at his level and nor is it realistic for you to force reaching his level if it isn\u2019t your sport.\n\nNow, enjoy your bike! Casual biking is amazing. Ypu cpuld go on cute casual rides. Take a book, ride to a nearby cafe. Lots of cute lil activities that involve a bike that having an ebike will keep you from becoming an ugly sweaty mess before doing said cute activity.", "NTA \n\nMy fiance loves to go on long fast bike rides. I love biking but can not in anyway keep up with him \n\nSo we go separately sometimes, and other times we go together but he matches my pace but occasionally zooms ahead then loops back around. \n\nOnly time that was ever an issue was when my bike broke down. Took him a while to realize I wasn't THAT slow ha!", "NTA", " NTA. I go cycling regularly and would love it if my wife came along. She\u2019s admittedly not athletic, but maybe someday I could convince her to try an e-bike.", "NTA\n\nHe's pissed because you're not suffering and in awe of his physique biking up hills.\n\nDude is a narcissist and manipulative.", "INFO: are you using the ebike motor as an assist just enough to keep up with him but still pushing yourself or are you just using the throttle?", "NTA\n\nIt seems like you already very clearly expressed how much difficulty and discomfort you were having. It's kind of silly that he says you should have said something. The ebike is fine. Does it have pedals that could be used, or is it purely electric? I suppose that might make some difference? You can peddle at least part of the time perhaps", "Some people prefer others to suffer \u201clike they have\u201d rather than let them have a little help to be able to enjoy things on the same level which feels lame to me. I shouldn\u2019t begrudge someone a life jacket because they\u2019re not as confident a swimmer. I\u2019ve taken my mom\u2019s e bike as a challenge to see if I can still beat her up the hills on my normal bike with her in full assist mode. Turns out I can but I haven\u2019t worked that hard on a bike in years and I ride a couple hundred miles in an easy week. I need to start doing some more hill training if she keeps getting stronger", "I didn\u2019t mind it at first, and there were also some things Nolan did that annoyed me as well (like the running joke of the gross uncle), but Troy was definitely way too high on his own product.", "I think a better comparison would be listening to an audiobook. It's not disrespectful, get serious.", "I just bought an ebike to help rehab for my knee replacement. Every direction is a hill where I live.", "It's not like he was very clear about what he was looking for in the experience of riding with her.  She assumed from his behavior that keeping up was the issue.\n\nThey BOTH need to communicate better.", "I love it! It's really easy to ride! And it folds up, so it fits in the car easier. I highly recommend it.", "I remember talking to a guy who had one, he said that he had to be really careful when not on country roads so he didn't get a ticket since the default speed limit inside towns and cities here is 50 km/h (30 mph) and many have lowered it to 40 km/h (25 mph). \n\nHe was about as far from a competitive cyclist as they come too.", "Wind resistance is 70-90% of the load unless going uphill.", "More like, you are going bow hunting and invite a one-armed friend who uses a modified bow.  Not disrespecting the sport, but making it accessible and enjoyable for your friend.\n\nI\u2019ve been in archery competitions with one-handed/armed competitors, and no one feels they are disrespecting the sport.", "She isn\u2019t missing a leg, though\u2026 analogy doesn\u2019t fit.", "Oh God my poor lungs hurt thinking about biking Seattle hills. Heck my anxiety hates driving seattle hills. \n\nHave him swim with you sometimes and see how that goes for him! J/k.", "Jfc he's expecting you to to keep up with him in SEATTLE?!?! What the actual ef?? \n\nSeattle is a nation built entirely of hills. That's insane.", "And he\u2019s within his right to not let her join. She isn\u2019t the AH for buying a bike, she\u2019s the AH for having shitty communication skills.", "The other big advantage, in theory, if you\u2019re strong enough, you can pedal harder. On an upright you\u2019re basically limited by your body weight\u2026 there\u2019s a certain point of pushing where pushing harder is just gonna lift you up instead of pushing the pedal down. On a recumbent you\u2019re pressed back in the seat so there\u2019s no limit. \n\nNow, 99% of cyclists aren\u2019t strong enough to matter, but at like a. Tour de France level those guys absolutely are."]}
