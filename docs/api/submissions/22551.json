He's great, we're good together, and I am excited to marry him.\n\nHe really enjoys biking hills and long distances and I'm into keeping fit but I'm mostly a jump-rope, swim, and walking kind of girl and I'm not super into doing difficult exercise with company. I prefer to push myself and answer to myself and be with my own thoughts when it's rough. \n\nMy fiance is more extroverted than I am and knows to let me have time to myself, but really wanted to share biking with me because he spends a long time on his rides and would prefer to have someone to do it with and talk to.\n\nOne of his biking buddies moved away and he asked me if I wanted to bike with him. I thought it would be nice to hang out for a while and said I said I would try it, but it ended up being really hard and I was not in the proper shape to do the loop he wanted. He kept telling me to change my gears and tried to teach me, which could have been sweet, but was mostly annoying because you can't teach muscles and breath capacity when it doesn't exist yet. \n\nWe tried a couple more times but both of us got increasingly frustrated because I couldn't keep up and I wasn't having a good time and he wanted me to be having a good time and keeping up with him. I decided to buy an e-bike so he could have company and I could do exercise I like at other times and when it came, I was excited to use it and we went on a ride. I thought it was great because I could go the right speed and keep a conversation, but now he's upset because he feels like I don't respect his sport and am not trying to get better at it, and he finds it demoralizing that he's pushing up a hill and I'm just gliding up with no effort. \n\nWe had a fight about it and he feels like I shouldn't just have bought a bike and if I really hated doing it that much I should have said something, but I felt like I could afford the e-bike and I like hanging out with him and I don't understand the problem.

He doesn\u2019t like to push up a hill while you glide up, that was how you felt when he was taking you on rides above your capability. Would he rather you didn\u2019t come along at all?", "NTA\n\nIts become clear that you don't enjoy and are not great at the sport, your bf is being stupid by saying this means you don't 'respect' it which is just really taking himself and his biking way too seriously.\nHe should be happy you're buying an ebike so you can still accompany him on these trips, why should his enjoyment hinge on you suffering through something you don't enjoy", "NTA. You\u2019re trying your best to find a compromise that works for both of you, while your BF is only happy if things are done HIS way. He needs to learn that relationships don\u2019t work like that.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I are cyclists. I can outride her. It was less fun having to go slow so she can keep up so she bought an e-bike and it's great. We can both ride together and get similar fitness benefits. I love it!\n\nYour fiance is a complete jerk. I dare him to go to a cycling forum and whine about you being on an e-bike. He'll get roasted.", "NTA, if your boyfriend wants to ride like he's in La Tour de France, then he can do. You're still getting exercise. You're still getting to enjoy spending time with him, and for some reason, that's not good enough.\n\nWell, that means that tlfor him its not about the enioyment, its about winning", "He\u2019s being absolutely ridiculous. \n\nHow many more hoops do you have to jump through before you become his acceptable biking companion. What an ass. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nDo what you want with your money", "NTA: I like how going slower wasn't a valid option for him, but now that you're doing what you have to do to keep up, he's annoyed about that too. I'm not sure why but that really rubs me the wrong way. It's completely unreasonable for him to ask you to go along with him and then expect you to keep up with something he's been doing much more seriously.", "NTA. The logical thing to do when you want to do something together that one of you is better at is to give the other person a reasonable way to participate. Golf? There's a ladies' tee and handicaps. Video games? You get the powered-up character, I get the enchanted bunny. Poker? You get three times the chips, etc etc\n\nIf he only wants to do this with you while he can be obviously superior, then don't do this together at all. Seems weird that he doesn't care if you're having fun tho.", "Nta. He wants to control everything in this situation- not just what he does but exactly how you should behave and feel. Not nice or loving. You are being incredibly accommodating and he\u2019s being a selfish AH.", "This situation is kinda why ebikes exist - they *can* make riding a bit easier (or just as hard but faster/longer). Imo it is a good idea for you to ebike on trails you'd otherwise struggle on, and it is still riding a bike. Some riders are purists and anti-ebikes. Some of this is down to perceived or actual thoughtlessness of ebikers, but I doubt you fall into this category. He needs to appreciate you sharing in his hobby, realise it's meant to be fun for you too, and tone it down a bit when riding with you. If he wants all-day epics maybe you shouldn't join him for those. NTA.", "NTA four you as you are trying to enjoy time with him.", "NTA. \nYou tried for him. \n\n>We tried a couple more times but both of us got increasingly frustrated because I couldn't keep up and I wasn't having a good time and he wanted me to be having a good time and keeping up with him.\n\nYou are not enjoying it, but you did that for him. that's so sweet of you. \n\nAnd you also found a solution to spend time together.", "ESH you should have asked him first, I agree it's a nice thought in my opinion but I can also see why he is offended by you going along with him and not making the same effort.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like it's hard to tell the pace when somebody is pedaling slowly but the bike is zooming. Then you randomly will see somebody going like 20 mi an hour out of a path which is dangerous again because it's unpredictable and maybe this is what he means by disrespect... Like nor you personally but the ebike demographics and lowest denominator behaviour he's embarrassed to be seen with one because then he can't act superior about it.", "NTA. I'm a middle-aged, overweight woman who commutes to work wearing a dress and riding an e-bike that has an upright seating position and a gloriously oversized basket on the front.  Passing lycra warriors while going uphill is my favourite thing, and yes I enjoy being a bit of an asshole. \n\nBut that's not what you're doing.  You've dropped good money to show that you really are interested in cycling with him.  If he's going to get sore over it that's his problem. Hope you enjoy riding your e-bike as much as I love mine.", "And there\u2019s the rub\u2026"]}
