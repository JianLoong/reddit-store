He was in pullup swim diapers because he is still potty training. We have been teaching him to tell us when he has to go potty. He told me he needed to pee, so I lifted him out of the pool and then walked to the stairs to get out myself because I have a bad back. When I got out, I saw that he had pulled his pullup down and was peeing in the pool.\n\nI told him to stop and that the pool isn't a toilet. He has a tiny bladder though, so at that point he was already done and pulled his pullup back up. I went to the lifeguard to tell her what happened but she said the chemicals in the pool make pee harmless so they only clear the pool if there is solid waste. She was also busy watching the pool, so I didn't want to continue to bother her.\n\nI started to walk away, and a woman came up and told the lifeguard that my son peed in the pool. She said she knew because she saw it happen and I already told her. The woman asked if the lifeguard was going to do anything about it, and the lifeguard said the chemicals in the pool would take care of it. The woman said the lifeguard was being rude because she wasn't looking at her while responding. The lifeguard said she was watching the pool so couldn't.\n\nThe woman asked to see a supervisor. I started to leave, but the woman told me to stay until the supervisor came because I was going to get in trouble. The lifeguard said I didn't have to stay though, so I left. As I was walking away, the woman asked if I was even going to reprimand my son. I said no because he was still learning what a toilet was and made a mistake. She said I and people like me are everything that's wrong with America.\n\nI feel bad that my son peed in the pool, and it is really embarrassing, but it was an accident.
