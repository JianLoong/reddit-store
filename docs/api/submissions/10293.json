By punishing this behavior, a young toddler is not able to distinguish whether he is being disciplined for telling parent and being aware of his body, or if he\u2019s being disciplined for the pulling down of the diaper. So he may associate negative consequences with important potty training steps. I didn\u2019t even know that swim diapers didn\u2019t stop pee from seeping out until I read this thread even tho I spent a few years caring for children, so now it seems like even more of a non issue for me cause no one polices a baby who pees in their swim diaper unnoticed (same potential biohazard if you think it\u2019s a problem) but even if a  diaper would stop the pee I still think OP did the right thing", "Hardly. I just remember me and my acquaintances growing up, trying to flood anthills, writing my name in the snow or dust...", "Guys are also socialised to pee quietly. Every toilet bowl has a quiet spot.", "That really doesn\u2019t negate what they said."]}
