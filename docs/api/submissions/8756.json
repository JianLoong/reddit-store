I haven't seen my half sister since before she got married but she used to take care of me when I was really little and she kinda has a hard time understanding that I've grown up since then. \n\nLike, she's really affectionate. Not just with her husband and kids but with me too and it's super uncomfortable. She was always hugging me. Like, when I wake up, when I leave for school, when I come home from school, and when I go to bed. I did talk to her and tell her I didn't like it and it mostly stopped but she was pretty sad and mentioned how \"cuddly\" I used to be when I was her kids age. She also insists on packing my lunches but I get the same lunch as her preschoolers, just bigger portions, and it's kinda embarrassing. Today was a turkey sandwich, apple slices, a gogurt, carrots and ranch, fruit snacks, and a cookie but also the sandwich, apples, and carrots were cut into shapes and she always leaves a note in my bag. It's just weird. Nobody else in my grade gets lunches like that. \n\nI started leaving her lunches at home and getting the school lunches but she stopped letting me leave for school until I showed her that I brought my lunch. I kinda blew up and told her that I was leaving her lunches on purpose because she insists on packing my lunch but makes the most embarrassing lunches ever with the stupid cutters and notes and doodles. \n\nShe's letting me get school lunch now but she barely talks to me anymore and doesn't even try to get me to spend time with her so I was wondering if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1675138892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10poai8/aita_for_leaving_my_lunches_at_home_on_puropse/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will say that you are not treating your sister well. She is doing her absolute best to show she loves you. She is treating you like her kids because A) that is the parenting experience she has and B) because she doesn't want you to feel left out or unloved. Your behavior is hurtful. Now she is trying to give you the space you want, and you are mad. That is hard on her. NAH. You can't help being 13, and she is trying really hard to do right by you.", "I'm not going to call you an asshole for behaving like a 13-year-old. I remember how everything my parents did at that age embarrassed me, just like most other kids in my class were embarrassed by theirs. The feelings of always being embarrassed, feeling irritated for the smallest reasons, and wanting to be like everyone else will eventually pass. \n\nThat said, please cut your half-sister some slack. Parents grow with their kids, and she quite simply hasn't had the chance to grow up with you yet. She's exhausted from having little kids, and she has no idea how to parent a teen. It sounds like she's trying really hard. I remember how at 13 \"trying\" was the most embarrassing thing ever, but it matters to your wellbeing, trust me. \n\nPlease also don't forget that adults' feelings get hurt too, and it sounds like you've hurt hers. Please step up and acknowledge that, and talk it out with her. Her hugs and her notes and her cutting your food into shapes have been her way of trying to show she cares, and it's okay if those don't do it for you. But please tell her what she does do to show she cares that you appreciate. If she knows what you like, she'll be able to do more of it. Right now she's just feeling like everything she does is wrong, and that's hard, you know?\n\nUltimately I think NAH. She seems like she loves you a lot and is trying her best. You've noticed that she's withdrawn and isn't asking you to spend time with her anymore and you're here asking us about it, which shows that you care about her too. Just go talk to her when you're feeling calm, non-defensive, and in a space to listen. You've got this.", "13 can be a shitty age as it is, and on top, it looks like things are a bit unstable right now, going by the fact that you are living with your sister and her family. You mentioned in one of your replies that you don\u2019t have any friends to feel embarrassed about the shaped sandwiches too.\n\nYou\u2019re not so much an asshole but an insensitive and self-absorbed jerk. Some people here are excusing you from the selfish part due to your age, but I teach students your age and trust me, I encounter many more unselfish and empathetic students than self-absorbed ones, especially when it comes to heavy stuff like this. \n\nYour sister has not only agreed to accept you into her home but is clearly going a step further and trying to make you feel welcome. You say you don\u2019t remember any of her kindness back when you were little therefore you don\u2019t really know her and don\u2019t love her, but that doesn\u2019t give you the reason to mistreat her the way you did. Some kids in your situation could focus on the fact that they have been put under someone else\u2019s care and therefore \u2018nobody wants me so I\u2019m gonna act out my hurt.\u2019 Yeah okay, fair enough, that\u2019s a very teenaged way of coping with big changes and hurt. But in your case, your sister isn\u2019t treating you like you\u2019re a burden. Rather, you\u2019re the one treating her like she\u2019s the overbearing burden when it sounds like, from your own account of everything, she\u2019s showering you with affection and making the effort to make you feel wanted. Yeah okay, animal shaped sandwiches aren\u2019t cool at 13 but she could have just given you basic buttered bread and tossed in an apple. All you needed to do was communicate that you didn\u2019t want shaped food instead of rudely ignoring the lunches and wasting food, and then exploding at her. She\u2019s not a mind reader.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly something more going on here. Whether this is misplaced anger at your sister when something else is hurting you, I don\u2019t know. If it really is just about the lunches and her affection, then you WOULD be the asshole. But I suspect there\u2019s more, which is why you\u2019re not quite an asshole, just a jerk.\n\nYou need to sit down and really reflect on what you want out of this living situation. And not just what YOU want. You need to make compromises and understand that a family - any kind of family under any shape and context - need to work together. Give and take. You can\u2019t just have it all your way. You acting like a self-absorbed brat against your sister\u2019s attempts to bond with you is doing nothing but hurting her and stressing you out. Is there a reason why you\u2019re so against accepting this affection and love? Is it fear that she might hurt you? This is an assumption, of course, since you said you didn\u2019t want to talk about why you ended up in this living situation.\n\nYou also mentioned in another reply that this all happened today and that she hasn\u2019t approached you after dinner for things like a movie or games. This is the time where I gently tell you to get your head out of your arse. You exploded at her out of nowhere and pretty much told her to go fuck herself by implication. Please remember that adults, especially ones who are trying to genuinely care for you, are not your verbal and emotional punching bags. You seem upset or worried that she hasn\u2019t acted like nothing happened and isn\u2019t happy go lucky with you. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worry that you hurt her more than you wanted to or upset that she hasn\u2019t gotten over it and made you the centre of the universe. Either way, you can\u2019t expect to treat her like trash and have her act like nothing is wrong. I imagine that your sister is incredibly hurt and lost on what to do. She may be keeping a distance from you either because she\u2019s hurt or because she thinks you don\u2019t want her to approach you. I would be thinking that too.\n\nThe only solution here is for you to think things through, try to identify what your issues are, apologise profusely to your sister, and ask for help dealing with whatever is going on.", "My daughter requested I make her fancy bento lunches with fun shapes all through middle and high school, and I had a blast making them. Her friends were envious, especially of the little notes I left. You are 13 and feeling self-conscious because you think you\u2019re the center of the universe and everyone is looking at you. They aren\u2019t. Instead of sneaking off without lunch and blowing up at your half-sister for being kind and loving, make your own lunch or tell her you want to purchase school lunch. I won\u2019t call a 13-year-old an AH, but you should apologize and start learning better communication skills.", "I know you\u2019re young so I\u2019m going to be gentle. YTA. She\u2019s trying to connect with you and you won\u2019t let her. Maybe try talking to her about what you DO want instead of what you don\u2019t. Find something you both enjoy so that you can spend time together. Make an effort to bond with her because at this point she\u2019s letting a stranger into her house when she doesn\u2019t have to. Please be reasonable", "I feel wrong calling you an asshole since you're only 13 and we all act out at that age, but you could have handled it more maturely if that's how you want to be treated. Apologise to your sister and tell her you appreciate everything she does for you, but that you felt embarrassed about the childish lunches and didn't want to hurt her feelings so ended up losing your temper. Then politely explain that you'd prefer to have more appropriate meals. You'll be pals again in no time.", "INFO: What made you have to go live with your half-sister?", "A gentle YTA\n\nNot because you're wrong about the lunches (you're not), but because of how you handled it.  This needed to be a discussion, not a situation which festered until it blew up.  You're young, so I get it to some extent, but leaving the lunches day after day instead of having a discussion was a poor way to handle it.\n\nI'm nearly 40 and the lunch was sounding pretty good to me.  I was wondering what was wrong with it until you mentioned it's cut into shapes.  Yeah, definitely not for a 13 year old.  She means well, it's clear she cares about you a lot and is putting a lot of effort in, but you're not wrong that the lunches are not age-appropriate.\n\nYou're 13.  She should let you make your own lunch.  Or get the school lunch.  \n\nBut try the conversation with her again.", "YTA, it was her way of showing you she loves you. I get its embarrassing, but all  you had to do was talk to her.  There was absolutely no need to be so wasteful by leaving the food behind.", "I can't call a 13 year old an AH, because I remember what a horror I was at 13.\nOk, you feel you don't know her and she doesn't know you. Start from there. Think about things you think you could do with her that YOU feel would start to make that relationship. What do you like? Are you a crafty person? Video games? Horror movies? Your sister can't know how to start building a relationship with you if she doesn't have an \"in\" to the 13 year old you when she only really has what you used to like to go from. If you don't like hugs and such, what forms of communication and affection are you comfy with? Is there a phrase you could say to each other as a hello/goodbye that conveys care but with the physical aspect taken out? \nThis is a marathon, not a sprint, but if you sit down and work out some ways YOU are comfy building from it means you and she are coming to the table from the same place rather than her striking out in the dark and missing and you feeling overwhelmed and smothered. Good luck OP.", "YTA. A simple conversation could have had her change what she was making if you let her know what it is that has you so embarrassed. If it was the notes or the cut into shapes, etc. \n\nEither way, cutting those shapes and writing those notes takes a lot of time and effort. Time and effort that she was dedicating to you to, at least in her mind, just make your day just a little bit brighter. \n\nAn apology to her would really help to mend things. Just explain what specifically it is that you are embarrassed about or what you are worried your friends will tease you for and ask her not to do that.", "Yta obviously. Just apologize & tell her you love her but you were embarassed... regular lunches would be fine.", "Damn you really have no idea how to communicate positively huh. Don\u2019t save things that bother you for until you erupt. YTA for being mean about these things to her when she is just trying to care for you the best she knows how. Have respectful and calm conversations about how you are a different place in life now and these types of love aren\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for.", "I\u2019m not going to mention what you are, but I will try to leave some solutions. \n\nYou\u2019re obviously going through a tough time right now. You live in a house with people you feel uncomfortable with, you\u2019re going through an uncomfortable phase where you worry about what your peers think.\n\nYour sister obviously wants to reach out to you. Are you aware of the term, \u2018meal prepping\u2019? Why not meal prep lunches with your sister. That way you get decent food that you\u2019re not embarrassed about and you spend time with her.\n\nButtttt I\u2019m guessing you might not want to pack any lunch at all. I know some kids got self-conscious about that as well. So you could always explain that you\u2019re going through a tough time and would prefer to eat school lunches to feel \u2018normal\u2019. If you do after school activities maybe ask for snacks only also? Could be a nice middle ground. \n\nAs for your sister though, I still recommend trying to cook things together. Whether it be cookies or cakes or lasagna. It can be dinner for the family or just something for you two to do. Honestly I\u2019m not aware of your entire situation but you\u2019re staying with her for a reason. Your sister loves you and is trying to make you feel comfortable. It\u2019s going to take time for you to get used to it. I\u2019d say try to be vocal about it, but be gentle with her. \n\nBut also, you\u2019re going to miss this when you\u2019re older. Your sister probably isn\u2019t perfect, but she\u2019s trying. \n\nHonestly, in High School and Middle School, a lot of people actually preferred the cute food. They thought it was cool. Do you know what bentos are? It\u2019s a type of Japanese lunch box. People make cute shapes and animals and it\u2019s adorable and delicious. \n\nI hope things get better for you. It might be time to start writing a journal and doing some self reflecting at this point in your life. You\u2019re young, but you\u2019re starting to grow up and you\u2019re going to learn that the way you treat people you care about really affects them.\n\nEdit: looked through some comments and just wanted to add, if you don\u2019t know how to talk to her, then you just need to tell her. Tell her you don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Tell her any and everything about how you feel like you two have grown apart and that she doesn\u2019t know who you are anymore and you don\u2019t know who she is anymore and you don\u2019t know how to bridge that gap. \n\nBut you wanna know how to start? You invite her to do something YOU like to do. You tell her what you like to watch. You suggest things to make for dinner or lunch or things to go do. \n\nIf she asks \u201chey, let\u2019s watch a movie\u201d you can say \u201ccan we watch this one instead?\u201d Or if you\u2019re really into books, you two could read books and discuss them. Or even board games or puzzles. \n\nThe ball is in your court, your sister will listen, but you need to talk to her, whether it\u2019s jibberish or not, just talk.", "Food is food\nDoes the shape change what it is?\nAnd ermagerd anite or doodle you can throw in the trash, and which is just her saying \"I care about you\". \n\nTeeny being teeny is a lame excuse. YTA and a bratty one at that. \n\nBesides people take time to adjust their behavior when they have not seen somebody for a while, especially when you're younger and change more quickly.\n\nSomebody at 25 or 30 is different from say 10 to 15.", "YTA. Your sister sounds amazing! You're 13, and theres a good chance you won't really see that or appreciate it until your older. Bring your lunches what others think don't matter. Don't be embarrassed that you're loved, they get square sandwiches and and quite frankly, gogurts are expensive. \n\nYour lunch is what I a 35 year old would bring to work, I would just either not cut my sandwich or cut it diagonal. I mention that so you understand that what you're eating is not anything bad at all, it's pretty standard. The sandwich cut into a shape is her way of making something standard and boring fun and loving for you.", "I don't know if you have been offered individual and/or family therapy or if you would feel ok to ask for it. Maybe it could help communication in what might be a complicate situation. It absolutely sounds like your sister tried her best but maybe not the way you needed her to.", "YTA, she\u2019s showing she cares. And from what I\u2019ve seen of school lunches, sounds like she makes a much better lunch.", "Having someone who loves you enough to pack you a lunch every day is amazing. 3 or 13 or 33, it's still the best.\n\nYou're 13, life sucks for you right now but you need to realise that these people are doing their best to be good to you. \n\nDo you know what's a million times worse than getting a hug and having lunches made for you and all the other things? \n\nNot having them.", "YTA kid, how terrible it must be to have someone love and support you so much and make sure all your needs are met. You\u2019re gonna miss this someday, you\u2019re gonna look back at how you stole her shine over a trivial matter and broke her heart. I know you\u2019re young, but you should be wise enough to proudly eat what your sister put a lot of thought and effort into to make a special memory. I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and think your sister has guardianship or conservatorship of you and your parents aren\u2019t in the picture now. She loves you, a lot more than other people in your life. Respect her, tell her you love her, eat her lunches that she took time out of busy day to make just for you.\n\nI really think she\u2019s crushed you went to elaborate lengths to not take her lunch. What I wouldn\u2019t have given to have a single adult give a fuck about me. I feel your sisters pain and it\u2019s honestly making me cry envisioning her completely shutting down over you not accepting her offering. Breaks my heart for her.", "Everyone in the comments being like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to call a 13 year old an AH, but\u2026\u2019 and I\u2019m scrolling like, \u2018I don\u2019t mind calling a 13 year old an AH,\u2019 lmao. \n\nYTA. But it\u2019s fixable. You only saw the outcome (the notes and sandwiches cut into shapes), but those were just a symptom of what she was actually doing, which was trying to show you you were loved and cared for (especially at a time of upheaval, when you have to live with someone you don\u2019t know well). When you blew up, she saw that as you rejecting her love and care, which is why she\u2019s withdrawn. You need to make it clear to her that you\u2019re not rejecting THOSE things. And you need to apologise.", "YTA\n\nShe's housing you, paying for you, making you lunches, and most likely picking up after you as well, and this is how you're going to repay?   Get over yourself and stop being the mean person in the house.", "Nah You\u2019re acting your age honestly but you have to understand your sister is doing it out of love.talk to her next time that you feel uncomfortable instead of lashing out. Just let her know it makes you feel uncomfortable . that you love her but it\u2019s a little embarrassing and that you are growing up . You have to realize that your sister is only used to dealing with smaller children. She\u2019s just making this up as she goes just like you are. So instead of icing her out, talked to her about it.", "YTA- she took time out of her day to prepare lunch for you daily. If you were annoyed at the shapes you could\u2019ve told her nicely instead of blowing up. Apologize and tell her you appreciate the gesture but you prefer buying lunch.", "YTA kinda, but not really. She\u2019s mothering you like she would her kids and you didn\u2019t like it - she\u2019s probably a little hurt, but she\u2019s respecting your boundaries and trying to be nice!", "Going from zero to sixty mph? Yeah, I think YTA. That was an impulse control and moderation fail. Normal for your age, but not acceptable.\n\nIt was also perhaps a fail on your sister's part that she doesn't recognize that people your age tend to not be able to avoid saying disrespectful things that should get them punished. She took it a little too seriously. In any event you should apologize to her.", "13 is just about the most embarrasing age possible. When I was 13, I lashed out at my mom for announcing in front of my friend that she made me a bath. Man I wish someone made me a bath now.\n\nLook, I see where you\u2019re coming from. At this age you just want to fit in with your classmates and the lunches seem like something that makes you look childish. But try to understand tour sister, too. It\u2019s hard to parent a teen as it is and she entered that situation very suddenly, with no prior knowledge. So she\u2019s just trying her best. Her best happens to be aiming a little below your age, but you gotta admit: she\u2019s really trying to make you feel loved.\n\nYou\u2019ve told her what not to do. Now tell her what she CAN do. There is no way she\u2019s gonna know what makes you happy if you don\u2019t tell her. Work with her, not against her. NAH", "Well, to give you a straight answer: yes, YTA. Your half sister is really trying to take care of you and show you love, and the way you handled it was honestly quite rude and apologizing would be the right thing to do.\nBut yeah, you are 13 and apparently in a somewhat hard situation, so the fact that you lashed out isn't that odd and this situation does not mean that you are a general asshole.\nYou don't actually know or remember your half-sister and that's okay, it is not your fault. But this is something that you should talk with her, or maybe write a letter to her, where you explain that you don't like being touched and think that the lunch is a bit childish? Maybe you could help her to find a way to show affection that doesn't feel so weird to you?\nIt seems that you have a caring adult in your life and even if they are a bit embarrassing sometimes, their caring and love is good for you and usually there is common ground to be found, if you both try. All the best to you.", "YTA. Those sound like great lunches. Blowing up at her wasn\u2019t cool, go apologise.", "YTA\n\ni mean expected of someone your age... popularity is important for kids in school and every single embarassment wants to be avoided... but i promise you... 10-20 years from now you'll look back at this moment and feel so stupid and you'll feel like the biggest asshole for not appreciating what your half sister is doing for you...\n\ni would love to get a lunch with a cute note.... or some shaped apples and carrots sounds lovely...\n\nif you want to be treated as an adult act like one... instead of leaving the lunch and exploding towards your sister explain to her that you feel embarassed at school with lunches like that and that you'd appreciate it if she could make you a more suitable lunch but that you appreciate the effort she puts into them", "Sof YTA. She does that because she cares about you. She takes her time to pack her kids lunches because she loves them. And she is doing the same to you. In her eyes, she sees you almost as a daughter, and probably cares just as much,   \n\n\nIf your issues is with how she packs the lunches and not the lunches, ask her if she can just put normal \"adult\" shaped stuff into the box (or a Tupperware, so it's even less child-like) instead of cutting them with special cutters. Otherwise, ask to join her when packing lunches and pack your own while bonding with her.   \n\n\nTell her you're uncomfortable with all the touching. But offer to have a movie night or girls night with her from time to time.", "Yta. If you don\u2019t want to be treated like a little kid then use your adult words and ask that your food not be cut into shapes. Problem solved with zero drama.", "Why aren\u2019t you making your own lunches?\nTry spending some time with your sister making the lunches, so you get what you like and not be wasteful.", "YTA. She cannot read your mind you know? I understand that youre going thorugh a hard time but thats not a good excuse. Instead on yelling at her you should communicate with her and tell her how you feel. How is she supposed to know her lunches make you embarrassed if you dont tell her? If you're embarrassed by the lunch she makes, just tell her that, and ask her to make a \"normal\" lunch. Why do you think screaming at her is the right thing to do? Talk to her and I'm sure she will understand. To me it seems like shes trying her best with you, and when you tell her you dont like something, she listen to you. \n\nPeople here are like \"oh youre 13 and acting like a 13 yo so im not gonna say youre an ah because youre young\" but no. Youre the asshole, idc if youre an immature 13 yo. You should apologize to her and tell her how you feel.", "YTA. Since her kids aren't old enough for her to understand \"the teenage years\", then she is experiencing them with you but hasn't been through that phase before. Just be more considerate. She's trying to take care of you the way she knows how to. Just apologize, and communicate with her about your feelings now that you are growing up. Your behavior is fairly normal for a teenager though.", "NAH\n\nNeither of you are assholes here, she's trying to do good things for you, you are trying to assert your maturity.\n\nSo far you've just told her what *not* to do.\n\nYou need to think about it and give suggestions of what you would like her to do, or would like to do with her.", "YTA. You\u2019re embarrassed for no reason. I\u2019m a big fat adult in college and guess what? My mom still leaves notes when she comes here or in my backpack or in my purse. It\u2019s not embarrassing to be loved. I know you\u2019re 13, but jeez kid I can promise that this stuff is not nearly as embarrassing as you think it is.", "YTA you should not have blown up or left them on purpose, you should have talked to her about it. I know you\u2019re young but you can still know enough to be nice when someone is trying to help you", "You\u2019re not an asshole but you didn\u2019t react great. I don\u2019t know your situation and why you\u2019re living with her but she\u2019s not trying to embarrass you. She\u2019s trying to show you love. I know it feels overbearing but lashing out on her for an act of love is so hurtful and she doesn\u2019t deserve that. I get not wanting those kinds of lunches. You\u2019re 13 so probably in middle school right now. I remember my grandma did stuff like this for me and I thought it was so embarrassing cause my friends would make fun of me for it. Just tell her you want more mature lunches. Tell her you don\u2019t need everything cut up like her kids and youd appreciate if she\u2019d just make it normal. You\u2019re growing up and naturally stuff like this gets embarrassing makes you feel like a little kid. I totally get that. She\u2019s not trying to treat you like a little kid I bet it\u2019s just weird for her to see you growing up and it\u2019s probably a little hard for her when the last time she saw you, you were little. And as far as the notes I get it\u2019s a little embarrassing but is that only because other people say its embarrassing? Kids your age can be mean about everything. I had kids make fun of me when my mom or grandma would write me little notes and it made me  mad at them for writing them. But now looking back, they were just trying to make my day better.

Your sister means well. And so do you or you wouldn\u2019t be asking if you\u2019re the AH. You probably shouldn\u2019t have been so harsh when explaining the reason you started eating school lunches. You need to have a heart to heart with sis. Just tell her you\u2019ve grown up a lot since the two of you spent much time together. And while you appreciate her effort, you\u2019re a teenager now.  You just need her to treat you more age appropriate instead of the same way she treats her much younger children.

I would suggest asking her if you can go with her to shop for your lunches and then make them together.  While this isn't the \"cuddly\" kind of bonding that she was expecting, it would be a really nice, low-stakes way to spend time with her and show your appreciation.", "YTA.", "Sounds to me like it\u2019s communication issues.

I haven't seen my half sister since before she got married but she used to take care of me when I was really little and she kinda has a hard time understanding that I've grown up since then. \n\nLike, she's really affectionate. Not just with her husband and kids but with me too and it's super uncomfortable. She was always hugging me. Like, when I wake up, when I leave for school, when I come home from school, and when I go to bed. I did talk to her and tell her I didn't like it and it mostly stopped but she was pretty sad and mentioned how \"cuddly\" I used to be when I was her kids age. She also insists on packing my lunches but I get the same lunch as her preschoolers, just bigger portions, and it's kinda embarrassing. Today was a turkey sandwich, apple slices, a gogurt, carrots and ranch, fruit snacks, and a cookie but also the sandwich, apples, and carrots were cut into shapes and she always leaves a note in my bag. It's just weird. Nobody else in my grade gets lunches like that. \n\nI started leaving her lunches at home and getting the school lunches but she stopped letting me leave for school until I showed her that I brought my lunch. I kinda blew up and told her that I was leaving her lunches on purpose because she insists on packing my lunch but makes the most embarrassing lunches ever with the stupid cutters and notes and doodles. \n\nShe's letting me get school lunch now but she barely talks to me anymore and doesn't even try to get me to spend time with her so I was wondering if I was the asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m a bit old for that now\u201d it\u2019s fine you don\u2019t like the lunches your sister makes or prefer something different, but your sister didn\u2019t do anything wrong by making them like this and it\u2019s a bit mean (but very common for a 13 year old) to express you don\u2019t like them in the way you did", "I don't wanna say YTA (just did lol) but she's just trying her best, and it sounds like she respected you not wanting to hug, I'm assuming she didn't continue to do it. She's gonna need time to understand the current you too, but you'll have to give her that opportunity. Remember not everyone has someone that loves them like this, you're lucky to have that. If you don't want those notes all you had to do was tell her. There was no need to be rude. Maybe she stopped talking because you don't like anything she does so she doesn't know what to do anymore, apologize and just start being honest with her and let her know what makes you uncomfortable and what you'd prefer she rather did.", "It\u2019s you, OP.  YTA. \n\nYou could have gently thanked her for your lunch and told he that the shapes and notes made you feel uncomfortable.", "YTA and when you are older (right now, you are actually just a child), you will understand the love and care that your sister was showing you.

Best advice is to learn how to set hard boundaries - it is totally OK to not like loved ones hugging you or touching you or being overendearing/overbearing. You definitely could have been nicer about it but it sounds like a repeated issue that's being ignored and continuously upsetting you till it blew up. Sounds like big sis is too focused on trying to fulfil the role she thinks she needs to instead of tailoring how she takes care of you to what you actually care about and enjoy. NTA. \n\nSister sounds nice and I think you should tell her you're sorry for blowing up - but not at what you blew up for. Imo that's more than fair enough, specifically if you warned her about it before and she just disregarded it and continued. Your sister will no doubt feel spurned bc she sees it as her only trying to be a good role model/ sister ect so by talking it out with her - which would be a very mature thing to do - you make it so you can both continue on happy and that sister doesn't feel as though she has failed at her duties which is a n upsetting thing to think about when she mightve been trying her ' hardest ' from her perspective. she- good luck to u both and hope u work stuff out. \n\nSource - never got taken seriously for not enjoying touch ect, mum still gets upset when I recoil from a hug that I'm not expecting - at this point its totally on her and every time it happens in my head the level of respect I have for her drops a little. Just shows me she doesn't listen but that's her choice and she's not trying to be hurtful or malicious but it upsets me regardless and even my therapist says that it's totally fine to set these kind of boundaries and get upset/angry at people for it if they ignore you.", "YNTA but ungrateful perhaps but you're still a kid and you're figuring it out.  Some ppl show love with food so by rejecting the food you also rejected her love.  You hurt one of the ppl that actually cares about you.", "NTA, because you behave your age, but... You are going to regret this so much when you're grown up!", "NAH - because your a 13 year old going through a tough time. However this is a great learning opportunity for you. If you don\u2019t seize this and continue interactions with people like this you will very much become an asshole. \n\nThink of the position your sister is in and think about how she is feeling and what\u2019s going on for her. Your sister knows this is a hard time for you so she\u2019s trying to engage with you. When you got upset over this she gave you space that you seem to want. You need to communicate clearer with her to let her know how you are feeling or what you want out of a relationship with her. It\u2019s a mature thing to have to do but you must realize relationships are two sided and you must think about others feelings more.", "NAH. Talk to her.", "NTA\nIt is better to give someone what they need than to make them take what you want them to want.\n\nAs the older person in this scenario, your sister should recognize that it's difficult for you to adjust and you have different emotional needs than a young child. \nIt sounds like she has interpreted your response as rejection, and she is hurt and maybe confused.  I don't think that pushing you away is the right way to handle that, though.  She willeventually learny that parenting teens requires more patience, really astute listening, and tough skin.\nShe just doesn't have the experience yet to know what to do.\nThis is a simple communication issue that can be easily solved by spending some quiet time together to communicate your needs and approach the relationship from a point of understanding and love. Be patient as you can with her. Her intentions are good.\nIf you have boundaries for physical affection, express them. If you would like to make your own lunch, that would probably be a great help! \nFind ways to show that you love and appreciate her that are true to you. \nThe biggest gift you can give your family is the ability to be introspective about your \"feelings under the feelings\" along with the ability to articulate them. \nAsk yourself \"why\" 5 times and start your statements with \"I feel...when.\"", "I know she loves me but she doesn't even know me and I dont know her and I dont know what to do about it.", "I would agree with this, but also say, in case OP or others in this situation read it, that no child is responsible for an adult's feelings. Treating them with respect and kindness and trying to communicate is one thing, but it always concerns me when it swings past that to the child or teen feeling they have to dismiss their own validity of feeling or thought or the way they want to be treated because an adult loves them. \n\nIt also sounds like Big Sis may have been in a weird spot when OP was younger and may relate to OP less as a sibling or adjacent equal and more as perpetual child.", " Best comment I\u2019ve seen.", "This needs to be closer to the top.", "So much this", "Doesn't OP know? food always tastes better when it's shaped like things!", "I would kill for a lunch like that and im an adult!!!", "This!", "Living with a ton of strangers isn't easy or fun either", "You're calling a 13 year old an asshole?", "I don't really wanna talk about it here.", "I think the intentions of the sis were great but as a parent figure you see past that and understand that the kid is being made uncomfortable with it. Just respect that i think. It's not an indictment on the sister but more a reflection of how it's making op feel which as should be dealt with or as we see here it'll just lead to resentment. At least since its out now and there doesn't need to be more issues. Shouldn't get to the point where the kid blows up though - sounds like when I used to ask similar things and people would treat as such a little thing - like get to fuck lmao - you are making me uncomfortable - hit with the inevitable \"you need to get over that\" ect. Sure try to get over it - till then respect that I don't want you near me if that's what I ask or else it's on you!", "Hate to be the boomer on here but that\u2019s just kids these days they think everything is a reality tv show and you score points by cleverly roasting people.

Her lunches and affection are her way of making up for missed time, or showing you she still cares or what ever else caused the distance. No you don\u2019t have to accept her hugs and affection, your body your right but I do suggest you find a way to positively communicate with her about your feelings and why. Find a time to have a deep and meaningful talk with her.

Be happy you aren\u2019t in the foster system.", "A 13 year old should know how to behave and show gratitude toward  people who didn't have to do anything for her but are doing it out of care and love for her. \n\nIt is an old enough age to not play mean in the house. They have other kids who are seeing this behavior and will pick up on it. \n\nNo one is asking her to be all lovey dovey to the family, but not throwing tantrums and not being an AH will help her a long way in life.", "INFO - if your sister had not taken you in, where would you be? \n\nWith your attitude, she\u2019s likely to hit her limit with you sooner vs later so maybe try being a little appreciative that she\u2019s the reason you\u2019re not in the Foster Care system or still in the situation that landed you in her home.\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to allow her in before it\u2019s too late and you end up shut out.", "Do you respect what she is doing for you, bringing you into her home and family, and trying to include you in things? Do you acknowledge that she is trying?\n\nYou don't have to love her - that will either come in time, or it won't.  But you might consider not actively being hurtful towards her.  She very obviously cares about you.\n\nPlease apologise to her, acknowledge what she is doing for you, and talk to her respectfully about what you want to do for lunch.", "Ohhhhh dang than thts a whole different story does she know that u don\u2019t actually remember her ? Maybe she would act accordingly then.", "You'll miss her if you went into foster care, no one would truly love you, or make you lunches or even care about you. \n\nCut your sister some slack, she's trying to reconnect. She's respected your wishes by not engaging with you, so you can't be mad at her for listening to you.  You rejecting her, well, you might find it comes with a big consequence.", "Set your necessary boundaries but just try and remember that though you may not remember her she remembers you. You may not know her well enough to love her but she\u2019s known you. She has love for you. You don\u2019t have to have a super good immediate sisterly connection with her. Just be a little empathetic. Sit down and talk with her. Tell her the things you\u2019re not comfortable with when you get the chance.", "If it\u2019s that short of time, you haven\u2019t really given her much of a chance to spend time with you. But, just talk to your sister calmly, explain to her, just like you did here. Let her know you appreciate her effort. She\u2019ll understand the reasons because she was teenage once. I\u2019m sure she just wants to let you know she wants to treat you no different than her own children.", "Also, whatever the reason. Perhaps ask sister about therapy/counselling to help deal with the transition. Suddenly having to live with people you don\u2019t really know and aren\u2019t comfortable with yet is hellish. Obviously OPs sister is trying really hard to make her sister feel welcome and loved in the way she thinks is best, hopefully a family counsellor can help them navigate it in a way that suits all parties involved. \n\n\nAlso, for what it\u2019s worth\u2026. I do lunches like that for my youngest. My oldest, also 13, recently asked me to make them for her too. As she felt left out. Cut up into fun shapes and everything. I didn\u2019t do them previously because I thought she would be embarrassed and want to use the canteen like her friends. But she came to me and talked about it. Communication goes a long, long way.", "For a sub so worried about morals, it appears you have none.", "Thanks captian obvious. You're a real stand up guy. Bunch of internet stranger adults calling a 13 year old an asshole LOL.", "In any ordinary circumstances then yes, absolutely. But for whatever reason this teens life has been turned upside down and a little leeway should be given for that. It sounds like it\u2019s a relatively new situation and everyone is adjusting - and honestly as adults we can see that the behaviour is far from ideal but I bet you were no ray of sunshine as a teen. I was certainly on the better end of the keeping out of trouble scale but even I wasn\u2019t fantastic for a whole. \n\nShe\u2019s going through a hard time and she likely had no say in where she was staying. It\u2019s hard living with strangers. It\u2019s hard getting used to each other. And it\u2019s hard figuring out how to communicate as a teen in a way that doesn\u2019t involve shouting.", "She talks to me and tries to spend time with me all the time. She usually makes me come down for dinner but today she didn't say anything when I took my food up to my room and she put her kids to bed 3 hours ago and hasn't asked if I want to watch a movie with her or play a game or if I need help with homework or anything. And she usually comes in to tell me to go to bed around now but she's not doing it today.", "This sub has nothing to do with morals its just about assholes", "Her feelings are hurt and she probably is trying to give you the space you appeared to be asking for. Tomorrow is a new day, have a chat with her.", "Here is *why* YTA. You are 100% thinking about you and only you. Based on your responses to comments, you are being insanely selfish and unnecessarily hurtful to a kind person. And aside from hurting someone who cares for you despite the fact that it seems like she was parentified at a young age to care for you, you're also hurting yourself. \n\nIt seems like there's bad stuff going on for you right now, and I'm guessing you have never been shown how to handle conflict in a healthy way. Stop acting like a spoiled toddler and talk to her kindly. Try to muster some appreciation for all she's done/is doing for you, which seems like a lot. Tell her what you want from her, rather than that's she's doing everything wrong. What *do* you want from her? Ask yourself if it's reasonable. She likely can't change the situation that caused you to be with her. But think about ways you would enjoy being given attention from her. If you don't want any, tell her you need time and privacy to process your life. Use your kind words before you explode and become TA."]}
