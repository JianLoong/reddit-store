It's the sentiment that counts.", "NTA.\n\nYou guys picked out those rings together.  That's the ring she put on your finger during the ceremony.  I'd say it's OK if you want to \"upgrade\" but it's also perfectly fine if you don't.\n\nThis is just a pure guess, but I would say that SHE wants an upgrade.  And this Christmas present is just a big hint as to what she'd like for your anniversary or Valentine's Day.\n\nNOTE that we're at 11.5 years and I am not interested in swapping out my tungsten carbide ring.  I did add to hers with a 10-diamond Anniversary ring on our 10th anniversary.", "NTA - I'm 100% convinced that 85% of AITA posts can be cleared up by nonconfrontational communication. I like your reason for not wanting to upgrade. You're sentimental. Not enough people are. You should lay out in plain terms why you love your old ring and why you don't want to upgrade. Make it romantic. You don't need a fancy upgraded ring, you just need her.\n\nPS - don't forget to tell her that you appreciate the gesture. Even if I don't think you're TA here, your wife deserves to know you appreciate how thoughtful she can be.", "NTA. If you told her clearly that you\u2019re not interested in upgrading your ring, it sounds like her gift was more about what she wants you to wear than what you want.", "NTA\u2026 She should have listened and heard you when you told her you weren\u2019t interested in an upgrade. She should have respected the simple fact that your original ring has sentimental value to you. It\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s making you feel bad about not wanting the new ring.", "NTA...You were brutally honest that you didn't want that ring, but she bought it anyway. I  guess you have it on hand in case anything happens to your original.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made it clear to your wife how you feel about your wedding band. The \u201cupgrade\u201d was more important to her than to you. This would make me believe that your Christmas gift was something she got for herself than something she got for you - because she knew you didn\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t think you need to do anything at all. Your wife needs to learn to listen to other people and not project her wants onto them.", "NTA.  Sentimental value always wins out.  And you told her ahead of time that you didn\u2019t want an upgrade.  You now have a spare but wear what you\u2019re comfortable with", "NTA - you didn't want it and the titanium ring holds more value to you", "NTA, a wedding band is a remainder of what you have been through and not a fashion statement. I do remember my pops ring with all the scratches and dents with him claiming he treasures it more than anything. Sometimes its what it means for us that makes it value and to you the one that has been on your finger is priceless. The new one is just a piece of metal with zero sentimental value.", "NTA. Not at all.\n\nI was tempted to write \"no assholes here,\" but honestly\u2026you've made it clear you didn't want an \"upgrade.\" I certainly think her heart was in the right place, but she was still wrong for buying you one. She did it for her, not for you.", "NTA and it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t told her before", "NTA. I think this is a hard one but she should try to understand that the original ring has a lot of sentimental value to you.\n\nIt's really nice of her to buy you a new ring (tho she should've taken the hint), and you should also show your appreciation (which you did!)\n\nIf I had the original ring and it meant a lot to me, I'd still wanna wear the same ring.", "NAH. Wear it on the other hand as \"jewelry\" for special occasions or whenever.", "NTA you told her you wanted your original.", "NAH\n\nAs someone who is sentimental myself, I understand where you are coming from. I also see where your wife is coming from. Maybe it would be good to talk to your wife about it and explain why you are not wearing the new band and work out something where both of you feel better about the situation.", "NAH. You made it clear for years you weren't interested in an upgrade. I don't think your wife is an AH, but she is imposing her preferences onto you. Maybe she is embarrassed by how inexpensive the ring is, but she needs to move on and accept that it means a lot to you.", "NTA. She was trying to do something nice for you while you find a lot of value in things you've had for a long time. People upgrade jewelry all the time but it's also understandable why you would want to hold onto the original. Maybe compromise and wear the old one around a necklace or something and wear the new one as a ring. She cares about you and just might not see how much you value the original ring.", "NTA - but this is definitely not the hill I would die on if it really affects your relationship with your wife.  There is plenty of compromises you can wear this ring as a chain or wear it in a different finger", "INFO: Did you \u201cupgrade\u201d hers?", "INFO - How can one improve on the ring that your wife put on your finger when you tied your lives together? \n\nWhat makes your wife's Xmas gift an **UP**grade?", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t want it or want to wear it. Convo over.", "Nta. She\u2019s being coercive and controlling. You are entitled to be (understandably) sentimental about your original ring as well keep/wear/like the one you initially picked out. It sounds like she wants an upgrade for herself but instead of voicing this like an adult, is trying to normalize this being a thing aka playing games.\n\nYou can say you appreciate the thought/ give her the benefit of the doubt, but it\u2019s good to listen when your partner has been clear on their feelings and not get offended /surprised/pouty when they still have the feelings they already told you they have.", "NTA, though I can't really say your wife is either here. You were very clear with her from the beginning that you never wanted to upgrade your wedding band. There's nothing wrong with having a sentimental attachment to the one you have now. At the same time, I can see from her side she spent assumingly a lot of money on a gift for you only to find out you aren't going to wear it at all. Though, since you had already told her from the beginning you had no interest in ever upgrading/replacing your wedding band really that's on her.", "NAH\n\nHave you asked your wife what's \"wrong\" with the original ring and why an ring \"upgrade\" was required?\n\nI can also understand why she is upset about you rejecting the \"upgrade\" ring, but have she even bothered to ask you why you like the original ring that you first got when you married?\n\nThe only advice I can think of is that you sit down with your wife and talk it out about the rings and reason why the \"upgraded\" ring is required!!  (I don't know, perhaps \"prove\" something or what ever the reason that your wife wanted this \"new\" ring for)\n\nYou probably can start by asking why she feels an \"upgraded\" ring is needed and what is it about the \"original\" ring that she is dissatisfied with or why she feel that the \"original\" ring is no longer needed!! (perhaps she feels that the \"new\" ring is a way to celebrate the 12 years of marriage, You have to ask her about that yourself)\n\nOnce she have explained herself, you tell her your reason for wanting the \"original\" ring and what about it is making you happy to wear it to the point that an \"upgraded\" ring is pointless!!  \n(be sure to explain your reason to why a \"new\" ring is not needed to prove the 12 years of love between you, so that she have a better idea of your feelings about letting go of a ring that's proof of your marriage)", "NAH but I personally think married people should wear wedding bands/rings. That's a fun added. \n\nit's just a ring, im sure it's means more to your wife than you think it does.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like she tried to use gift giving to intentionally override your stated preference. But she should have sorted that out with you in a discussion instead of playing the \"generous gift\" trump card to sympathize her case, therefore NTA.", "NTA but How about you compromise and tell your wife you will where the ring on good occasions like going out on dates,somewhere fancy and keep your old ring for every day where", "NTA my dad refused a new ring he said as it wasn't blessed it would feel meaningless to wear it...he only relented when his original ring had to b cut off and my mum kicked off about him walking round ringless...he still hates it \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, you were clear about what you like and why you liked it. You'd think after so long together she's get that.\n\nOf course, you do realize her main goal is for you to buy her \"upgraded\" rings, right?", "NTA she knew your feelings and decided to do what she wanted. It wasn't really a thoughtful gift at that point.", "NTA, but be weary of titanium. If your finger ever swells, a hospital will have a very hard time cutting it off and may need to call the fire department. This happened to my brother in law, and shortly after we both got silicon bands to replace our titanium ones :)", "NTA.\n\nYour wife put her wants, to see you wearing a nicer ring, above yours. She is an asshole.", "NTA. You're right, it's been there through it all and it means so much to you. I don't think any upgrade would mean as much as this one does for you.", "**NTA**\n\nI want to tread really carefully here because stirring up trouble in an otherwise-happy marriage is just an ugly, unkind thing to do and not something I'd like to be a part of. But having said that, I also don't feel right saying N-A-H, simply because this wasn't even an honest mistake on your wife's part; you were clear about your feelings - and this WAS about your feelings, and something very sentimental that had emotional value to you - and she MADE AN ACTIVE CHOICE to disregard those feelings and buy you a gift that served her interests and preferences and specifically contravened what you had told her you wanted. What she did wasn't a mistake or an error, it was a choice not to hear you or care about your feelings and . . . well, that's not good for a marriage either.\n\nYou are not \"too sentimental about objects\" because that's not a thing. You're allowed to be sentimental about whatever you want. Caring deeply about the ring that signifies your bond with your wife, regardless of its monetary value, is not a failing on your part . . . it indicates that your values are genuine and heartfelt and not about flash or how things look to others, or how much they cost. I am concerned, though, that that is not the case with your wife, to the point that she would actually DISMISS your feelings about your own wedding band - the signifier of your commitment to your marriage - in order to prioritise a meaningless band that was not the one she originally put on your finger, just because it cost more and was fancier. It might be different if you wanted that, but you didn't. And it's your ring to wear, to honour your commitment.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, but I think it's time to sit down and talk to your wife about your mutual values, and why that flashy ring meant so much to her that she would choose to hurt and disregard your feelings over it. Because that wasn't a nice surprise, after being told that you DID NOT WANT IT. It was just a signal that your feelings didn't matter to her.", "She got you something to replace a sentimental item which you have already told her you don\u2019t want. She doesn\u2019t have the right to be upset", "NTA.  This wasn't a genuine gift for you - she gave you something she wants but you don't.\n\nI think it's worth a conversation to see if your wife does want her own ring upgraded, and it would be nice do so, perhaps as a Valentine's Day gift.\n\nI also wonder if she's embarrassed by your low cost ring for some reason?   Is she very image or status conscious?   My guess is no one else actually cares what your ring looks like - honestly they never even notice.  But your wife has this imagined scenario where everyone you meet notices your ring and magically knows you only paid $50 for it and thinks you're poor, so she wants you to wear a nicer ring.  It would help to talk through this and get to the bottom of it.  She may need to talk to a therapist to work through her feelings and get to a healthier self-talk script.", "NTA New rings if worn out and it was a renewal of vows, I can fully understand, but as a Christmas gift? I don't get it really.  You already expressed not wanting a new ring. My wedding ring was stolen and hubby got me a new one, which we chose together on a trip of a lifetime, so that all made sense.", "NTA. You repeatedly said no and she didn't listen. Have you upgraded her ring, if not that's her hint to you.", "NTA. However, for some reason, this appears to be important to your wife. Jewellery seems to have more importance to women than men (that is my observations only), so there is probably some reason you don\u2019t understand why she did this. I would wear the new one and not say anything. It will make her happy.", "NAH. Maybe wear it for special occasions. She may want an \"upgrade\" for her rings in the future, so this may be something to discuss to avoid fighting about later on.", "NAH. It's just a ring, and it only symbolizes your bond - the actual bond is between the two of you, not a ring.\n\nWear the titanium ring to remember how much you love your wife. Wear the new one to remember how much she loves you.\n\nI've got 4 wedding rings, but I've never been divorced (we're over 31 years now). #1: I got married with this one - it's nice, with a diamond. #2: a plain gold band I wore on Army deployments to war zones - didn't want to lose the nice one in the sandbox. #3: This one has turtles - my wife gave this to me on our 5th anniversary in Hawaii. #4: This one belonged to my grandfather - my mom gave it to me when her Dad died.\n\nI'll wear any one of them on any particular day. Gives neither my wife nor me any stress as they're just an indicator of marriage. Mom loves to see me wearing her dad's band, wife loves to see me wearing turtles. Plain band still comes out when I'm engaged in DIY around the house.", "NAH you don't have to replace the band your already wearing, and you could wear the new ring on the other hand or on the same finger as a passing of time and evolution of your relationship gesture.", "Wear it for special occasions. My SIL wanted my brother to have a band with diamonds. A few years later he asked what happened to dad's band, which I had and gave to him. I suspect he wanted it all along but let her have her way.\n\nShe insisted on having her mom's engagement ring so her dad bought mom a new ring and she claimed he bought cubic zirconia. Not a nice woman.", "Are you a Christian? Part of a religious wedding is the consecration of the rings during the service. A replacement ring has not been blessed. \n\nI'm not religious myself but my wife is. She would be very hurt if I discarded my wedding ring for an upmarket version. And yes, sentiment does play a large part. (Married 34 years now)", "Completely agree.  Honestly I\u2019d be perfectly fine with paper rings if and when I get married.\n\nNTA buddy.", "This was 100% my approach.  Twice. She still only seems to see it as a rejection of her gift. She did mention that I should just take it back and trade it for something else or money.  I might discuss the trade option for something else special.", "Eh it wasn't that thoughtful if she was told no several times...", "Or not compromise when he was very clear about not wanting that and his wife ignoring his clear boundary for whatever reason.", "Nope.", "really? I'd say the wife as an asshole. He loves his ring, doesn't want a new one, communicated that fact many times, and got one anyway.\n\nWho cares how much she spent. she's an asshole for trying to force a new ring on his finger.", "I definitely dont fault her for buying the gift. We discussed that night my reasonings, and she shared that she thought that was just my excuse for not wanting her to spend money on me. It was super sweet of her to do it. We just have different sentimental levels, so sometimes they clash. She still mentions the ring though.  It's just a weird place that I feel like a bad guy, but cant bend myself to swap rings.", "I mean I would fault her. She well knew he didn't want a new one and his reasonings and did it anyway. Then gets upset with him over it? It wasn't a thoughtful gift at all.", "He's wearing the ring she put on him at the wedding.  He doesn't want the flashy upgrade.", "An option might be a shadow box or putting it on a chain and wearing it around your neck, so it's close to your heart. \n\nMy husband has about 5 different alternate wedding rings, because his weight fluctuates, and he has silicone rings for working out, but his original, far-too-big-now wedding ring sits in a special box, in a place of honor.\n\nMaybe you could do something like that. \n\nShe's feeling rejected because you don't currently have a use for it, most likely. Give it a similarly sentimental use, and you may resolve the issue.", "NTA\n\nThis is too bad that it even happened because it appears that you had told her prior to buying this ring that you were very happy with what you had. She just felt that once she got you a new ring, you would change your mind. If people would just listen to each other instead of assuming they know better, a lot of these issues would never occur in the first place.", "Could you possibly wear one ring on each ring finger? Maybe wear the original on the right hand and the new one on your left? Or is that just too many rings? \ud83d\ude02", "this is sorta an aside from your actual troubles, but be real careful with titanium rings. if you're ever in a situation where medics need to get the ring off you in a hurry, they won't be able to use the special ring cutter tool and they'll have to dremel it off your finger, which is not ideal", "I mean yeah you can be stubborn about it but disagreeing is a part of being in a relationship and when she\u2019s clearly trying to be nice it doesn\u2019t make sense not to attempt to resolve things.", "Then NAH, seconded to wear it as another piece of jewelry", "This. I can't wear my original rings because after having kids they don't fit anymore. My dh bought me new rings for our 15th anniversary.\n\nTo be honest, my first rings were cheap. I told him then that if he went into debt over my rings the answer would be no so he bought what he could afford and I love them.

My husband and I have several different rings and aren't as sentimental about our every day wedding ring we wear. But we both have a very nice set of rings we wear for special occaisions. My husband typically wears either a Qalo ring or a titanium ring because they are generally more comfortable but will wear the fancier ring when I ask him to when going to more fancy events.
