There\u2019s a 2 hr direct flight from my city to there\u2019s but flying in planes gives me a lot of anxiety (I had some very bad experiences with turbulence) so I avoid it when possible. My dad and I already disagreed and had a small argument about this, he wanted to book me a round trip flight because he worried about the long drive but I refused. \n\nAt dinner yesterday, we had family over and they asked me about my trip. My dad unnecessarily brought up that I\u2019m \u201cirrationally terrified\u201d of planes and then started making fun of me in front of everyone for having so much anxiety about flying. It made me feel really stupid and disrespected so I stood up to leave the table. My dad said \u201ccome on, I\u2019m just teasing. Lighten up\u201d which set me off. I said loudly in front of everyone that I knew coming to see him for the holidays was a mistake but my mom had told me to come spend time with him out of pity even though I\u2019d rather be with my mom and stepdad. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t true, I said it just to make him feel as embarrassed as I felt. It had the intended effect, it upset my dad and he told me to leave the table which I did. My stepmom came to my room later and said my dad was sorry for upsetting me and that I should apologize to him as well because he\u2019s very hurt. However he never actually apologized to me, it was her apologizing to me on his behalf. \n\nSo I refused to since he didn\u2019t even acknowledge his actions. Which is how I\u2019m at my current state now, where my dad and I are pretending the other doesn\u2019t exist and the only person we\u2019re talking to is my stepmom. It is just as awkward and strained as it sounds. I also can\u2019t drive back because the roads are very icy right now.

He is not a dick for refusing to cater to her irrational fear, he is a dick for embarrassing her in front of guests about it.", "YTA. he made a joke about you being afraid of flying, which honestly you shouldn\u2019t be so insecure about, and in retaliation you said something both cruel and untrue. grow thicker skin. ur gonna forget he made this joke about ur fEaR oF pLaNeS in like <5 years, but he probably won\u2019t ever forget when his daughter told him she only spends time with him out of pity. jesus christ", "NTA, but since you said you didn\u2019t really mean it, just said it to hurt him, you should apologize regardless if he does. Apologize for you, not for him.", "NTA. My friend also has extreme anxiety when flying and has to usually medicate to make it through the flight. Not once have I thought about making a joke about it since it's serious to her.\n\nIt's very insensitive to make fun of someone else's issues especially when you spent 13 hours driving just to work around it. Honestly, he should just apologize as any sane adult would. If he doesn't even make that effort, it doesn't seem like he's even trying to understand your issues. You obviously realize what you said was hurtful, but what he did was also hurtful to you.", "NTA", "Why is it funny?", "It's nothing about insecurities. Her dad was insensitive. If you've ever met anyone who has this anxiety, it's terrifying to them even thought it may seem as irrational to you or me. Some people have extreme anxiety over flying and are truly terrified as a life/death situation. Please try to keep an open mind.", "Problem with the last line is that it's hurting the person you're making the joke about and the people that don't think it's funny", "OP said she drove down a few days prior, so it's safe to assume the roads weren't icy then. \n\nAnd maybe the world at large doesn't care about a person's anxiety, but their family sure as fuck should care. Her dad was an asshole first, he should apologize first. Why should she care about his feelings if he acts like he doesn't care about hers?", "Edit - just to put things into perspective, what OP said and their refusal to apologize until they receive an apology is lowkey setting the stage for \"and my Dad and I haven't spoken for XX years..\"\n\n\n>Why should she care about his feelings if he acts like he doesn't care about hers?\n\nBecause she doesn't, her fear of plane turbulence and her self-image in front of guests is more important to her. Unless this a medically diagnosed phobia, then she can/is physically  able to fly. Assuming her dad is willing to pay for her round-trip ticket, and if seeing her father means as much to her as she implied, then she can be an adult and deal with something that makes her uncomfortable for a few hours since the end result is what everyone wants (more family time). She chose not to, her dad eventauly gave her flak for it, and she got upset because she felt her dad was embarrassing her in front of guests. The same guests she felt it was appropriate to embarrass the whole family in front of just to be spiteful...\n\n>Her dad was an asshole first, he should apologize first.\n\nThat is naive as fuck. Easy way to stunt your own emotional maturity is to cling to shit like this. If OP wants to work things out, then waiting for the other person to reach out first is 100% not the way to ho.", "Mocking someone's fears and anxiety and deliberately trying to humiliate them is cruel.", "What burden is her dad shouldering by OP choosing to drive?", "So basically she's an asshole because she didn't want to do what her father wanted her to do (I.e., fly)? I guess we just fundamentally disagree because I think it's a very adult decision to appropriately manage her anxiety by being willing to drive instead of forcing herself into a situation where she could have a panic attack. She's done the healthy thing for herself, and I think that's fantastic. I also think it's fantastic that she's standing up for herself. I hope she stays firm on not apologizing until her dad takes responsibility for his behavior.", "How is she asking him to cater to her?", "He doesn't have to take her anxiety as seriously as she wants him to. He can freely talk about what he wants to among the guests he invited.", "So asking somebody not to tease you about a sensitive subject, especially in front of other people, is asking them to cater to you? I wasn't aware it was so difficult to simply avoid certain subjects, wow.", "NTA. I have a severe phobia of feeling stuck, which includes being on a plane,  so I take Xanax to fly (100/10 recommend). I joke about my phobia, because I know it\u2019s ridiculous but I also can\u2019t help it - and that\u2019s exactly what I tell people. I know it seems silly but I can\u2019t help it. If they want to make fun whatever they\u2019re a dick", "NTA- if you're willing to go through that long ass drive (no offence ment) your anxiety is clearly not at joking about it levels", "\"Society\" and \"dad\" are very different, especially in this context.", "Lol you think everyone with a phobia it's supposed to go and get it diagnosed?", "> Why is it his problem and not hers?\n\nBecause he was a dick about it and she wasn't", "> Deliberately and maliciously striking out at people for unintentionally hurting you,\n\nYou're making shit up. There was nothing unintentional about it", "No, I just learned you can't take everyone who claims to have anxiety or some other kind of mental health concern at their word because it turns out most people kinda suck a self-diagnosis.", ">she's an asshole because she didn't want to do what her father wanted her to do (I.e., fly)?\n\nNo, she is an asshole because she decided to go glassed earth in reaction to a dispute that could have possibly been avoided from the very start. She is an asshole because now that the damage is done, she is whining about no one apologizing to her first instead of going to try to directly resolve the issue through earnest communication.\n\n>I guess we just fundamentally disagree because I think it's a very adult decision to appropriately manage her anxiety by being willing to drive instead of forcing herself into a situation where she could have a panic attack.\n\nSo a 19yr old woman driving 14hrs by herself is a safer more adult decision then just taking a free 4hr-flight? On paper that sounds better for her and her anxiety 100% and I'm not disputing that. But from the perspective of her dad, that thought is kinda anxiety inducing as a parent. Again, she could have compromised on this, as she wasn't the only one with legitimate concerns/potential anxieties about her trip.", "> . But from the perspective of her dad, that thought is kinda anxiety inducing as a parent. \n\nAt least he won't have to worry about that next year.", ">So asking somebody not to tease you about a sensitive subject, especially in front of other people, is asking them to cater to you?\n\nNo, we are actually 100% on the same page, that isn't catering at all. You are asking them to respect a social boundary that you clearly verbalized.\n\nSo where in OP's post did she specifically ask her dad not to mention her anxiety about flying? Where did she clearly verbalize those boundaries to her father?\n\nShe never expressed this concern/embarassment about her anxiety to her dad. So why should he see a reason to avoid the subject when among family, and it was not explicitly stated to be a taboo subject."]}
