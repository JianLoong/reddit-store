There\u2019s a 2 hr direct flight from my city to there\u2019s but flying in planes gives me a lot of anxiety (I had some very bad experiences with turbulence) so I avoid it when possible. My dad and I already disagreed and had a small argument about this, he wanted to book me a round trip flight because he worried about the long drive but I refused. \n\nAt dinner yesterday, we had family over and they asked me about my trip. My dad unnecessarily brought up that I\u2019m \u201cirrationally terrified\u201d of planes and then started making fun of me in front of everyone for having so much anxiety about flying. It made me feel really stupid and disrespected so I stood up to leave the table. My dad said \u201ccome on, I\u2019m just teasing. Lighten up\u201d which set me off. I said loudly in front of everyone that I knew coming to see him for the holidays was a mistake but my mom had told me to come spend time with him out of pity even though I\u2019d rather be with my mom and stepdad. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t true, I said it just to make him feel as embarrassed as I felt. It had the intended effect, it upset my dad and he told me to leave the table which I did. My stepmom came to my room later and said my dad was sorry for upsetting me and that I should apologize to him as well because he\u2019s very hurt. However he never actually apologized to me, it was her apologizing to me on his behalf. \n\nSo I refused to since he didn\u2019t even acknowledge his actions. Which is how I\u2019m at my current state now, where my dad and I are pretending the other doesn\u2019t exist and the only person we\u2019re talking to is my stepmom. It is just as awkward and strained as it sounds. I also can\u2019t drive back because the roads are very icy right now.

They would have had a good Christmas. He decided to ruin things but for some reason you think she is wrong because she didn't shut up and take it.", "Sure I can get that but making fun of someone and say their irrationally terrified of flying is not Innocent teasing.  people who are actually teasing and not bullies don't say \"come on I'm just teasing, lighten up\" when they've upset the person that you're teasing, they apologize and stop.", "You're right it is no way to function in a relationship.

And it still doesn\u2019t make it OK what she said. She went for the jugular.

She decided to drive instead. He opened his mouth and made fun of her. Yeah, he had a choice. To mind his own business.", "How the fuck is it's innocent?? The dad made fun of the daughters anxieties and fears after she went out of her way did to drive 19 hours to see him didn't stop when when he clearly made her upset. It's not Innocent when you upset people especially when you don't stop when clear they don't like it. It's also incredibly telling how you didn't address the part where he said \"come on I'm just teasing lighten up\" that is not something that you say when you innocently teasing someone you care about and it upsets them, that's something that you say when you're bullying someone and want to make it seem less bad than it is.", "Woof. You might as well just wrap yourself in safety bubbles.", "If you\u2019re going to get worked up over this, then maybe we should stop. I already know where this is going. You\u2019re going to start insulting me next\u2026 You\u2019re already close to the edge of that with your comment about how it\u2019s \u201ctelling\u201c that I didn\u2019t address something you said. I didn\u2019t need to address it because I didn\u2019t think it was valid.\n\nA lot of people have a fear of flying it I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any stigma behind it. As such, I think the teasing had a benign basis rather than the comments she said to her dad, which probably struck too close to home.\n\nPlease stop cursing at me.", "Nah, I surround myself with people who actually respect me."]}
