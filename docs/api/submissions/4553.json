Yesterday was a Sunday so I dedicated the entire day to her. I told her that I had a freakout about the gift due to my toxic relationship with work, and we made up completely over it. I also told her that my actions don't undervalue her gift in my eyes and I'll always remember her while using any of those things, lol. I went a bit too sappy on her I guess. But we had fun, she's still sleeping beside me, and it's just been a fun day overall... :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, reflecting on what I did through the comments on the post and the community's help at least made me realize that I had a lot of toxicity to work on. I guess my blaming my parents wasn't completely fair either, given how everything had been. My birth mom passed of cancer shortly after I was born and dad threw himself into work, relying heavily on babysitters and wet nurses to have me cared for until he got remarried, and still was thrown in work. My stepmother, who I have to refer to as \"mother\" because she has legally adopted me, is not a very nice person to me. She didn't deprive me of anything my half-siblings had and did keep me fed but that was about it. There was these few times she tried to take out her frustrations with my dad out on me and I have good reasons to believe that maybe one of my step-siblings isn't blood related to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn that note, I think I will try to reapproach my father (who I barely am able to talk to), and force him to tell him what my mother was like, and to try to break him out of the shell he's created, possibly from the grief of losing my birth mom. If I can do something like that, then I can think I have somewhat fixed my own problems too. Right now, the only people I can call family are my girlfriend, and her family is sweet and I'm friends with them but I'm \"not there\" with them yet. I'd love my father to get to know them at least somewhat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now, I'm boarding a freight in 2 days, I have the rest of the day to spend with her, and possibly the night too :). So I'm trying not to bother about this. When I get back from the ship, I'll get these things done, slowly. I'll have a late valentines' date night to look forward to after I am back and a lot of things to work on, both on myself and my situation with people close to me.", "created_utc": 1670840039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjusa7/update_aita_for_paying_my_girlfriend_money_for_a/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Glad to hear you\u2019ve patched things up with your gf. It\u2019s also great you are open to growth and self-improvement.\n\nOne little word of caution though, beware of giving away all your power in this situation. By that I mean, you can only control (and therefore heal) yourself. You can\u2019t, and probably shouldn\u2019t, force your father to do or admit to anything. If you are going to make your own healing contingent on his behaviour, you\u2019re just disempowering yourself. If whole process depends on his being ready and able to give you all the answers, what happens if it doesn\u2019t work out that way? He may never be able to talk about your mother or break out of his shell. Then what? Of course he might, but if you\u2019re pinning everything on him being able to, you\u2019re in for disappointment.\n\nTherapy is a great idea. That way you can unpack the baggage in a safe environment and make a plan for how and when to confront your father. You can have clarity and understanding of your own needs and your process will be your own. \n\nGood luck", "Your relationship sounds so loving and wholesome. I hope you work through your issues. You may want to consider working through your issues without involving your father at first. Therapy may help you navigate that. And you are not required to call that lady your mother even though she adopted you. Best wishes, OP.", "That's great! I'm the commenter who mentioned having a frugal partner and how they see spending money on a loved one! Based on everything else I can tell from your posts, you guys are doing great creating and maintaining(that's the hard part) a good relationship.\n\nI knew you'd have a happy update. Don't criticize yourself anymore for anything about this relationship hiccup. I guarantee you didn't get too sappy. It's good you're taking steps to grow emotionally. I wish you guys all the best!", "Childhood trauma: the gift that keeps on giving", "People have it worse with their step-parents so I'm just showing a bit of respect. That's probably it. \n\n\nI do need some therapy but I guess it mostly boils down to learning what kinds of behaviors I have from ignorance and killing them one by one.", "Please consider taking a more graceful approach to yourself. Killing them one by one implies that they are fundamentally bad. The behaviours you\u2019ve adopted were coping mechanisms, and there\u2019s no benefit to beating yourself up for them. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that because you\u2019re not fixing things that are inherently bad, you\u2019re evolving to be the person you want to be every day.\n\nI agree with the other poster who said you are to engage in therapy and continue repairing things with your girlfriend before you ever bring in your father. Especially when starting therapy, things get a little messier before they get better and you want to be in a stronger, less susceptible place when you approach your father.\n\nBest of luck OP, and safe trip."]}
