When I got there  I saw Kent there hugging him and talking. I got pissed and stormed over and yelled at Ray that it was time to go and I told Kent that I better not see him there again or he'd get sued for damages. Of course on the way home Ray was upset and told me it's not fair of me to treat Kent like that and the he loves him and I reminded him that he' was gunning for a baseball scholarship and that might be all down the drain now since he has to sit out a season and we still don't know how well he'll heal. I  remind him how Kent could have gotten both of them killed and he just got somber and quiet.\n\nRay went straight to his room when we got home and I talked to my husband about it and he told me that yeah Kent would show up sometimes to help Ray and mad I asked how could he want that boy anywhere around right now and he told me that I have a right to be mad but seeing Kent is keeping Ray positive and helping with his recovery and that maybe I shouldn't have reacted like that.

That's a very very scary thing to happen. Hopefully he'll learn from it. While your son is a minor, he's not a young child and whether you like it or not, they're gonna keep meeting up. The best you can do is make peace with what happened and be thankful neither of them were killed. Kids are gonna do stupid shit. \n\nInfo: do you have contact with the boyfriends parents?", "YTA", "YTA. That isn't the way to handle the situation. Your son is going to want to see his boyfriend and use him for emotional support throughout his healing. You are only isolating him from a main source of healing and making it worse", "NAH Search what is the best to help your son recover. not who is to blame.", "YTA\n\nI understand you're upset.  But don't you think Kent is already feeling guilty?  Or that Ray is hurting enough as it is?  Kent is trying to comfort Ray.  Support that.", "You're not necessarily T A for not wanting him around but choosing this hill to die on looks like it will only cause a rift in your relationship with your son.", "Yea YTA. Just cause you're mad, doesn't mean your son should suffer.", "YTA. Banning your son from seeing someone will only make them want to do it more and they will resent you for it. He may end up either running away in the future because of this. Or leaving when they are 18 and never coming back", "YTA for the exact reasoning you put about why you may be the asshole. You have the right to be upset at Kent, but it seems to me that he\u2019s remorseful for his actions and cares about Ray enough to try and help out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
