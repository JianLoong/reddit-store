{"id": 32289, "submission_id": "18a15l8", "title": "AITA for finding out a dark family secret and refusing to give up learning my family's native language?", "selftext": "My family is originally from Portugal but my parents moved in their twenties to the US for university and have stayed here ever since. I am 16 years old and I hate the fact I am monolingual. My parents refused to teach us Portuguese when we grow up here. My siblings and I asked our parents multiple times to teach us and they refused saying we don't need it and that it would have stunted our English. I asked my parents to get my software to learn Portuguese many times and they always said no because I need to focus on school and shit, my siblings kind of stopped caring as we got older.\n\nI started learning when I was 14 with websites like duolingo, mango languages, and other free sites. When I was 15 I started speaking to my parents in Portuguese who were a bit shocked as I kept a secret for a few months. They told me to stop learning it and to just speak English, I told them no, that I want to learn Portuguese and they'll help me. They kept saying I'm a spoiled brat and they refused to talk to me in Portuguese. I honestly think they're pissed at this point because they used to talk about us in Portuguese so me and my siblings couldn't understand. They still did it but now they had to speak really quickly or use weird coded phrases that were difficult for me to understand.\n\nI made online friends from Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde and East Timor who I taught English in exchange for Portuguese. We had skype calls, played video games together etc sometimes playing video games for like 5 hours which began to piss off my parents. They said I was wasting my time and we would get into arguments where I would tell them I wouldn't be \"wasting\" my time learning Portuguese if they just fucking taught me Portuguese in the first place and they would go off on how I'm ungrateful and how they grew up in a dictatorship in Portugal (they were born in the late 60s and early 70s so they didn't experience shit) and their life sucked in Portugal bla bla bla.\n\nFinal straw came when I started contacting family I had in Portugal. I only visited Portugal twice and I couldn't even communicate properly with most of my family there because they don't know English. I found out that one of the reasons why my parents have low contact with them is because my mom was engaged to my dad's brother and my mom had an affair with my dad so that ruined relations with both sides of the family. I found this out by talking to my uncle and cousins.  I brought this up at dinner and asked why my parents never told us this and my parents were so fucking angry that they both threw food across the table and told me I'm grounded until after spring break. I'm considering just going to my friend's house, his parents already said yes. My siblings are also really angry at my parents as they are now realizing that we lost relationships with family because my parents are too selfish and stubborn. My parents took away all electronics except for this secret laptop I have which I hide in the ceiling panels, they check all my eletronics to see if im using language learning software and took away everything since im grounded now.

Event though i have a Brazilian surname, we just didn't know! \n\nyour parent's reaction is so out of order, they could have told you and reframed it as a love story.  but instead, their selfish actions denied you so much, and it was deliberate. you are American-born Portuguese, and they denied you that. their selfishness, in trying to deny your heritage, because they are ashamed of their actions.\n\nalso \"my mom was engaged to my dad's brother and my mom had an affair with my dad\"\n\nso your mum cheated with her fiancee's brother, but if the family you have in Portugal, seem to be happy to let it go, and move on, to have a relationship with you. why are your parents not doing the same?\n\nyou could have lost, your heritage, culture, and language for good, because of your parents actions, so if i was you, get to your friend's home as soon as possible\n\nyour parents just aren't cheats, their denial, is now abusive to you in taking your items, because it's not just the language they denied you.

As an example\n\nboa sorte...and i got that from Google. i don't speak Portuguese either", "NTA.\n\nBut you're at least as stubborn as your parents, I hope you know that :)\nBilingualism is a great gift for children and it was incredibly selfish of them not to teach you their mother tongue. I kind of understand their logic, but it doesn't change the fact that they did wrong.\nIt seems it's sort of a habit for them to make wrong decisions.\n\nAffair, not teaching you Portuguese, and now grounding you and not letting you learn the language.\n\nYou already know everything, and unless they have even more secrets, it doesn't make sense to prevent you from learning Portuguese.\n\nThey don't seem like people who you can convince with reason, so just plan your future to be independent from them ASAP. And then do whatever you want, learn whatever you want and meet all the family members you want.", "NTA, our kids grew up bilingual (Dutch, Danish, Icelandic, and English), and they all started learning other languages like German, Spanish, and French later on. \nAnd it's such an advantage to have! \n\nI'm sad your parents get so angry at you for wanting to learn a different language,  especially because they know (at least) two languages themselves.", "So, your father f\\*cked his brother's fianc\u00e9e years ago and now YOU are grounded???\n\nNTA for learning another language.\n\nThat's wealth.\n\nI speak 5.", "NTA your parents seem abusive, I wish you the best.", "You need to try and start setting yourself up to get the hell out of that house ASAP. Easier said than done but your parents sound like psycho assholes.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour parents are probably thinking they are helping you, but every bilingual person I know has NEEDED the skill at some point. In all honesty, your parents sound racist. They probably have some issues related to Portugal and do not want you involved with the culture or country.", "NTA but DAYUM!", "NTA. But you really don't have to spell out your laptop secret hideout in every word.", "NTA. \n\nYou are allowed to learn any language you want.

Being stubborn of mind is a good thing, but you should learn how to approach the situation differently.

You weren't an asshole for going ahead and learning it on your own, despite your parents wishes. You weren't even an asshole for searching out your foreign family.\n\nAnd they weren't assholes for not wanting to teach you the \"old country\" language. My Mom's grandparents came to the US from Europe, and as of the day they arrived my Mom's Grandpa never again spoke the old language. \"This is my new country and I'm speaking English.\"\n\nHowever, the interactions you described with you parents are very assholeish: \"I would tell them I wouldn't be 'wasting' my time learning Portuguese if they just fucking taught me Portuguese in the first place.\" How bratty and entitled!\n\nAnd then the way you threw the \"dark secret\" in their face when you found it was horrid. It sounds like you did it in a way that screwed up not only your own relationship with your parents, but also your siblings. You are horrid.\n\nNotice that I'm not defending your parents here.

Kind of a dark secret was expected though. Most people are proud of their heritage, unless some trauma or some fucked around and find out is associated with it.

His parents have went above and beyond to prevent him from learning Portuguese providing no reasonable explanation why. OP will obviously have an outburst at some point.

Thus, he brought it up to the parents.", "no, not one bit\n\nmy family came to the UK, in the 1890's, and the actual Brazilian surname, which was longer, got anglisied to a single name. A lot of Brazilian surnames have De or Du, and mine was dropped.\n\nmy great great grandmother had an illegitimate child. hence the reason, we still have this last name, and never apparnelty told her son, where she was from. so there was a lot of confusion. it was only when the 1901 census came out, (i had the name of the great grandfather, who was a baby in 1901, and on the census, and his birth certificate. had his mother's name and place of birth, and it was Sau Paulo Brazil!\n\nmy family is a bit of a mixture when it comes to ethnicity, so when it comes to things like complexion, some have more of an olive skin tone than others. mine is considered pale olive.\n\nthat's why OP's question struck a nerve with me because i know that denying someone's heritage now, and not being honest leads to further questions down the line.", "What do you think brazilians look like?
