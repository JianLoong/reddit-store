It was school holidays a few weeks ago in our country - I work from home so the girls were with me during the day.\n\nDuring the school holidays, Leah got her first period. But the problem was, we didn't have pads at home. We have tampons for guests, and I use a menstrual cup/period underwear. I didn't think getting Leah to use tampons right away was a good idea - it was her first period, she's still young, and I also felt like it would be overstepping if I taught Leah how to use a tampon without permission from her parents.\n\nMy partner was in a meeting, so his phone was on do not disturb and he didn't see my call/message until a few hours later. I don't have their mum's contact. This led to another problem - in our country, you can't leave kids alone until they're 14. I don't have a car, and I don't feel comfortable taking the two kids anywhere on public transport without their parents being aware (especially when one of them bled through her pants).\n\nIn that situation - I decided to let Leah use my period underwear. It was a little big for her, but it was thoroughly cleaned and dried. Not sure if relevant, but I've only used the underwear once - I'm on birth control and get my period less than once a year. I thought this was the best solution until my partner picks up some pads on his way home. Aside from assuring Leah that the bleeding was normal, I waited for my partner to get home and discuss with his ex-wife how to give Leah \"the period talk\".\n\nMy partner has no issues with how I handled it, but his ex-wife, on the other hand, did not react well at all. She said I treated Leah like a \"second-class citizen\" because I gave her my used underwear, and she wants to change the current custody arrangement (from 50/50 to 90/10) because my presence would harm the girls. She also said the fact that we didn't keep pads at home shows that we are unequipped to parent the girls.\n\nMy partner has my back - he said he would have done exactly what I did and continues to defend me. But I see that he is heartbroken, his ex-wife has engaged her lawyer (and he's engaged his lawyer too), but he is scared that he will lose custody of his daughters, or that this would affect his relationship with his daughters. But was I the asshole? Was giving Leah my underwear inappropriate?

I mean, if she was so much more caring and responsible, why hadn\u2019t she supplied her daughters with an emergency pad or two in their bags? It could have happened in school. Would she have then pulled her daughter out of the school if she didn\u2019t approve of the brand they supplied her? Or worse still, between school and home on public transport, would she have banned them from ever traveling lling on public transport again?", "NTA - the other option was stuffing TP in her undies until dad got home. We\u2019ve all been there, not fun. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, no judge would entertain a custody change over this. \n\nSnidely, maybe mom is \u201cunequipped\u201d to parent the girls if she hasn\u2019t had the period talk yet with her ELEVEN year old daughter! Some girls get a period at age 9! I think you did the best you could given the circumstances (I\u2019m also a stepmom and had to handle first period with my stepdaughter)", "Big NTA. They were clean and they were your only option at the time. What else were you supposed to do? Let her keep bleeding through her clothes until your partner got home?\n\nYou did the right thing. Your partner supports you and agrees you did the right thing.\n\nHonestly, it just sounds like the ex has been waiting for a reason to change the custody agreement to screw over her ex/your partner so is blowing this out of proportion.", "NTA. Did the ex want their child to destroy their clothes? Free bleed? What? \nHow were you supposed to predict her period? Lmaooo jeez", "No judge in their right mind is going to award custody over poor planning for a girl's first period. More than likely, the judge will think that was a brilliant solution. You don't mention Leah feeling bad about any of this, so I assume she had no issue. The ex is using this situation as a power grab and is likely to fail. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> My partner has no issues with how I handled it\n\nDone and done.", "NTA. I bet Leah was happy to have you help her with a stressful situation. You handled it well.", "I'm failing to see how this is risking custody. I don't think any judge is going to change custody agreements over something like this. Not everyone uses pads. Not everyone uses tampons. Not everyone uses period cups. It's a personal preference, but what do I know?\n\nWell this is odd overall (in my opinion at least), it's not the worst idea overall given you had very little to work with", "Why didn't the wonderful ex already have the period talk with her daughter?  Why didn't this saintly mother of all mothers have a kit prepared and ready? \n\nShe has been itching for a fight with her ex...this is just the best excuse she can find. I have a feeling any judge might rule against her for creating a situation by not preparing her daughter for the eventually of this.", "NTA this is not about you or the underwear. His Ex was just waiting for any excuse to change the custody agreement.", "This was the most appropriate solution. I\u2019m from a family with a lot of females. Stuff gets shared sometimes out of necessity. Her mom could have packed her bag with pads just in case. No one\u2019s at fault here. You handled it reasonably. Also those underwear are expensive and you gave them up. Obviously being a good person here with good intentions. I don\u2019t see the big deal.", "NTA.  If anything you overthought this which just shows me how responsible and caring you are.  Wow.  If all step parents were like you, earth would be a better place.", "NTA. The ex is looking for a fight - any fight - in order to harm your partner and his relationship with his kids. She would have used absolutely any decision path you took as a weapon against you both.\n\nYou did the best you could in a bad situation where your hands are tied behind your back. Hopefully the judge smacks her down for making bad faith claims to the court.", "NTA\n\nI may be wrong but I got the impression ex-wife was just looking for a reason to pull this stunt and this event is what she landed on. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA - any judge is going to ask what she would have preferred you do.  \nWhen she can\u2019t respond with anything the judge will dismiss it.", "NTA but you did not have the mum\u2019s contact but the kids must know their mothers number right? Why did they not call her?", "NTA, and this is so ridiculous and going to hurt that girl. To find out her mother is using such a personal experience to try to take custody from her father? OMG. What a cruel woman \"mom\" is. She's clearly upset about you being the one at such a moment than anything else.", "NTA. The only thing you might\u2019ve been able to do differently is go to a neighbors for pads or have some delivered. There\u2019s nothing wrong with presenting a sustainable way to manage your cycle.", "NTA.\nYou did nothing wrong and helped that girl. I remember getting my first period and it was horrible and embarrassing.", "NTA. Given her age why hasn\u2019t her mom prepared a go bag for her. Consisting of pads, midol etc? Why hasn\u2019t her mother had the period talk with her? Why hasn\u2019t her dad? They\u2019re both parents, periods are for everybody. You were unprepared for this situation which to be fair can happen to anyone. You handled it as best as you could until her dad got home. You comforted her, explained it was normal etc. perhaps though you can ask for her number so you can contact her in the future if you can\u2019t reach your partner. Is the mom normally high conflict? Because 90/10 split is extreme and I can\u2019t see a judge agreeing with her.", "NTA.\n1) She's 11. Maybe that's a normal age in your country, but here, it's fairly early. I wouldn't have expected this already, so the fact that you didn't have pads is not weird.\n2) It was only until your husband got home. It was a necessary thing. I agree, tampons would have been bad and you would have been in so much more trouble then. If this does come to a case, all you need to do is ask the mother what you should've done. You can't let the poor child bleed all over the place. That would be traumatic. By the way, her mom making a fuss over this is also traumatic.\n3) Wearing another person's underwear may sound unhygienic, if the underwear was washed properly, there shouldn't be a problem. If this goes to court, she'll need to prove any harm or potential harm that came or could've come to her daughter. There was/is none so there is no ground for a case. \n4) I'm betting the mom is upset because her daughter did not have her first period at your place. She wanted to be the one to go through this with her. To have to explain things. I think she's lashing out because of that.", "NTA. Her mother should have proactive and had a period bag ready for her or at least discussed with you. \nReusable pads and knickers are best anyway because they don't have harmful chemicals. I am glad this next generation will have less gynaecological issues due to quality reusable products. I only started on reusable pads this year and has already been helpful.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA exactly but I would think it's weird to share used underwear, so I'm not surprised that her mom had a problem with it. I definitely don't think it will affect custody. Was there a reason you couldn't pop out to the store quickly to get pads for her tho? Or even take them with you if needed, after getting her to change and roll toilet paper to put in her underwear for a few minutes? (I know this depends on if there's a store nearby) Keep pads in the house for her now that it's started and I don't think anyone can blame you for not being prepared. 11 is still considered early I think.", "YTA. I'm going to go against the grain because I think wearing someone else's underwear is gross. Doesn't matter if it's clean to me. I would still feel grossed out wearing underwear that someone else has already worn. Also there were other options you could have done. Like running to the store to buy pads. Or calling her mom to let her know what was going on so she could deal with it.", "It\u2019s a bit weird to give someone else used period pants. Her dad should have drove to the shop and got her pads.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The underwear was clean, nothing wrong with that. If you\u2019d given Leah nothing then you probably would\u2019ve been accused of neglect.

I agree about the tampons, 8 is too young and if she hasn\u2019t been very active in sports using a tampon would break her um.. cork. It\u2019s not a cork. Anyway. However period underwear for someone so young could be a bit traumatizing since it\u2019s a step away from a diaper- and 8 years old is like a step or two after wearing diapers..Im exaggerating okay, but I\u2019m sure you know what I mean. Tbh there are a lot of delivery services these days, including store delivery services. I\u2019d suggest doing one of those next time?\n I hope the custody thing gets thrown out. Im sorry.

But then maybe the ex would've reacted the same \"you didn't even bother looking for options before making Leah bleed through toilet paper for 4 hours?!?!?!\"", "Rather than TP in underwear she could have used a folded washcloth as the toilet paper sometimes gets icky and breaks apart.

Are you authorised to make medical life and death decisions? If you don\u2019t, this again shows a lack of forethought and responsibility on all adults parts.\n\nIf there had have been option to call the mum, I personally would have done it because it is always sad for a parent in a separated family to miss milestones. \n\nBut if you truly had no option available then I think you did the best thing possible, handling it calmly and without traumatising Leah.", "NTA.

I agree with others that it seems like she is using this as a convenient excuse to try and get full custody. I suspect from some things that you have said we are likely in the same country. A couple things I would suggest is make sure you talk to her teacher so that they are aware incase she needs support at school. Also always make sure she has a back up pair of undies in her school bag. I am a teacher and have had multiple students 2 years younger than her start their period. While my school has talks with our year 5+ students this only happens every 2 years. Many schools are the same or wait until intermediate (year 7). Since summer is also coming up I would suggest you have a look at period swimwear (just like period undies) for her so she doesn\u2019t miss out. I know Ruby sell some. Doing both these things will show her and the courts that you are being proactive and supporting her once you both registered the need. And yes do have the talk with the younger one, I have come across a 6 year old with it before here so it\u2019s best she knows it\u2019s a normal thing to not panic about.

No, only surprised.  \nShe had told me about the changes in a girl's/woman's body and on that day she reminded me of our talk.  \nLuckily, the shops were still open that day, so she went and got me some pads. Again: no trauma, no damage, only a memory of a milestone in my life.\n\nI'd honestly like to know what got the mom's panties in a twist, but tbh it sounds like she was just waiting for an excuse to hurt your partner.  \n\nPlease stop beating yourself up.

Honestly I feel like you could\u2019ve just told her how to use a tampon because generally you are supposed to have a talk or education about periods before they happen anyway so if her mom didn\u2019t already have that talk with her then it\u2019s her fault. Honestly pads can be more difficult when it comes to worrying about bleeding through your pants, but if you wanted you could\u2019ve also just used toilet paper folded over and over to resemble a pad too in the meantime.

(Assuming your period underwear was stained, that is a bit gross.)\n\nThat said, this is nothing to lose custody over.  It sounds like your partner's ex has been sitting there looking for something, anything, any small infraction, that she can use to upset your partner and wrest away custody.\n\nI doubt that any sane judge is going to take this complaint seriously.\n\nNTA", "So the ex is cray-cray! I'd do your best to ignore her aside from your partner going thru the ridiculous custody stuff!\n\nAs she has expressed that she would like to use period underwear, grab a few pairs that she can use while she is at your house, as well as some pads. It's not really a parents decision what menstrual item a child uses - the child decides and the parents buy within their budget.\n\nMy kids carried emergency period packs from 10. They went to and from school with them and even when they stayed over at their grandparents, it got swapped from school bag to overnight back. Even at 15 and 13, both still carry their emergency pack - for occasions it starts at school and also if a friend needs a product. They just top it up themselves are required. If they know they have their period, they'll pack pads so not to use their emergency supply.\n\nSounds like you're being a great mother figure. If possible, once things calm down, I'd try get the mother's contact information so in future you are able to communicate directly to her for any of the daughter's needs, if the dad isn't available or the girl isn't comfortable with dad.", "Ex wife likes to be horrible .", "I mean, it was a little weird, but not AH weird. I assume she had her own underwear with her, so I think most people would have just helped her make a makeshift pad out of paper towels/tissue/toilet paper/washcloths etc., maybe given her some towels for added protection depending on what her activities were for the next few hours and explained how to check on herself every x minutes to make sure she hadn\u2019t bled through.  I mean it\u2019s only for a few hours until your partner could bring pads or approve use of the tampons.\n\nBut I can\u2019t see a judge changing a custody agreement at all much the less so drastically over that. It\u2019s just too crazy for such a minor issue.", "NAH Just a little insight, because I see that you are thinking the ex is jealous- she's not jealous. She's ashamed and frustrated because she wasn't there to step up to the mom plate for her daughter's first menstruation. She didn't get to shelter, comfort, or explain anything about this milestone- a practical stranger did all that instead. And now her child is telling her she prefers what the stranger did. You did the right thing this time, but in the future, you should call her mother (you absolutely SHOULD have her number if you're alone with her children, what are you thinking?) about big milestones like this and let her be involved. Remember, she shares 50/50 custody with your partner, and not you. You didn't intentionally trample over this big moment, but trample you did.

Giving someone used underwear let alone used period underwear maybe extremely unhygienic even if they have been cleaned/washed/dried.

Mom should've already talked to her daughter and given her pads to keep in her overnight bag. My daughter has a makeup up with some in her backpack and overnight bag.
