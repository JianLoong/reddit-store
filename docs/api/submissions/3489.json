It would be a very useful exercise to look at what their financial future (including resources for long term care) might look like if they chose option B, to go live with the younger sibling.  Such a scenario and analysis should take a hard look at their care and access to proper medical resources.  \n\nIt may (probably will) end up that the smarter decision remains option A; but at least, that option will be chosen after some thought.
