I often find Tiktok pranks needlessly mean-spirited (I remember a trend of people pretending they were breaking up with their partners and if someone ever did that to me, I would ACTUALLY break up with them.)

I would be upset too.", "NTA   That's not a 'prank' that's an attempt to emotionally hurt you and then to publically embarrass you.", "Ideally pranks should be something that, in the end, the pranked person should also find funny or be OK with afterwards. Somewhere along the line people seem to have  started labeling bullying \"pranking\", possibly as a way to get around TOS or other repercussions... and society seems to have just generally shrugged and gone along with it. A lot of people mirror things they see, unaware that the ones that get jillions of views are typically extremely (and often obviously) staged.   \n\n\nThere was a post on r/BestofRedditorUpdates where it collected the posts of a guy whose girlfriend burst into the room and destroyed his PS4 in order to give him a new PS. Her friend was recording and while they said it wasn't for online clout, we all know it likely would have been posted online. It ended up ending the relationship, as it caused serious trust issues and the old PS was full of unsaved files and accomplishments that he could never really get back. He was also taken aback that she didn't have enough empathy to understand why he was upset until he asked her how she'd feel if he destroyed her phone or laptop. She also wasn't able to tell that the original video was staged. He also ended up giving up gaming since it just left a bad taste in his mouth.   \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/s2aciy/my\\_girlfriend\\_broke\\_my\\_ps4\\_for\\_a\\_tiktok\\_trend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/s2aciy/my_girlfriend_broke_my_ps4_for_a_tiktok_trend/)", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a taboo everywhere but really it\u2019s still shit.

I think pranks are the result of childishness and bullying under the guise of humor. I would sanction one more, though.

The purpose of this \"prank\" is to upset people, then laugh at them for being upset. They shouldn't be surprised that the result is you being upset.\n\nYou did threaten to break her phone. You say you're autistic, so I understand how you might not realise that's what it sounded like, but \"you're lucky that X, or I would have done Y\" very much implies a threat that you might very well do Y in the future, when X is less true.
