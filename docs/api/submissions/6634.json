I have Aspergers, and I was diagnosed when I was a kid.\n\nSo, there's this Tik-Tok trend that's been going around where the 'pranker' lies to a loved one by saying that a celebrity they look up to died and putting that reaction online. Personally, I think it's incredibly disturbing and a breach of personal trust. My oldest sister decided to try this 'prank' on me by telling me that Paul McCartney had died. I grew up with the Beatles, and they helped me a lot during times of depression, and she fully well knows that I'm a massive fan. I have posters, I have records, I have books.\n\nWe were in the kitchen. Me, my oldest sister, and my youngest sister. I was getting a glass of water when she looked up from her phone and told me that Paul McCartney was dead, causing me a moment of panic in the back of my mind. For half a second, my world was shattered. I know it might sound pathetic, but that single moment ruined my night. I don't engage in celebrity worship, and I know that one day, Paul WILL die, but... I feel like she hurt me, despite all that.\n\nLuckily, I knew about this trend from Reddit, and I was able to gather my thoughts quickly and figure out she was lying. I told her that she hurt me, and she still found it to be a harmless joke. My other sister agreed, and laughed along with her. I said that she was lucky I knew about this trend beforehand, or I would've probably broken her phone as a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nLater on, I told my parents about what happened. Both of them, my mother and my father, laughed about the prank at first and seemed to think it was funny. Eventually, my father sided with me and saw how harmful it was that my sister even thought of it to begin with, but my mom took her side and said I was being too sensitive, especially because I caught on to the prank before any harm could be done and that my reaction to it was too much. My brother didn't have an opinion. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, that I'm the only one who seems to think that the very IDEA of this prank is psychotic to begin with. They all seem to think it's funny on principle, and I don't.\n\nI didn't break her phone, nor did I threaten to. I said that it was likely to happen if I wasn't aware of the prank beforehand. I know I have some anger issues, but I've been dealing with them over the past few years.\n\nSo...

Some things will offend you more, some things less. But for your siblings, the INTENT behind their actions would more likely be nothing past heinous. But still, the consequence would still affect you as bad as it could. Moving forward, it's best if you come to better understand how their thinking works so as to prevent yourself from being as badly affected by their actions as you were.

There's nothing funny about that.  \n\nIt's good you're aware of your anger issues. Sometimes bad things do really happen. You need to find away to diffuse your anger that doesn't destroy property or physically hurt you or anybody else.  At some point in life somebody will likely have to tell you some very sad news and you need to be able to control your actions appropriately.\n\nNo you didn't take crazy pills - your sisters are just caught up in this dumb prank because it's what is popular this moment on TikTok -hopefully they'll give it more thought.  you're correct - it's just mean, laughing at somebody who thinks another person died is awful.", "NTA - chronically online people need to look up and read the room", "NTA.
