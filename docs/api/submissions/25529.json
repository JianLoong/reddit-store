I never neglect my tires. \n\nI am surprised you married a man who is a replica of your parents. The three of them are on a different path/approach to life than you. They would drive me nuts. Only you can decide if you can live the rest of your life like that.", "NTA if the root issue is you are \"tired of being surrounded by people who don\u2019t want to achieve goals and succeed the same way I do.\" because clearly that's a big problem. Especially if you are married to someone who doesn't align with you on this. \n\n\"I honestly just want to succeed and live to my fullest potential.\" - it doesn't sound like you are in a situation where that can happen and you need to think about wanting a lifetime of this with your husband.", "NTA, it just sounds like you and your husband may not be compatible.  Sometimes we choose things without knowing any better, and then we no longer need those things when we become healthier...  I think maybe you've just outgrown him...", "NTA.  Most people don't realize, when they are in an automobile, YOUR TIRES ARE YOUR LIFE.  True story.  I used to work field service, driving a Dodge minivan (loaded with lots of tools, ladders, electronics) all over New England.  The vehicle was brand new (about 6 months old).  But like most new vehicles, the tires it came with (original equipment) were SH1T.   I kinda knew this, but didn't think too much about it.  Then one day in summer, it was about 26C and sunny, but the area had just had a brief, intense rain shower.  So the roads were wet.  I pulled out from a stop light at a normal rate of speed, entering an intersection to turn left.  But when I turned the wheel to the left, the minivan kept going STRAIGHT.  I was literally sliding, just like on ice.  At maybe 20MPH or less.  Lucky, there was nobody else near me, and I recovered (somewhat) just before bouncing off the curb on the road I was trying to enter.  So no damage done to anybody or anything, but it scared the crap out of me.  See, I had to do driving like this hundreds of miles a day in ALL seasons.  So I just found out my tires were dangerous for wet roads.  What about ice and snow?  AND, I might add...the tires still had at least 80% of their usable tread on them!!!\n\nAs soon as I got back to the office, I told my story to the owner of the company.  He was a reasonable man.  He authorized me to replace the tires immediately.  And I did.  I drove straight to my favorite tire dealer and put four new tires on the company credit card.  The difference was amazing.   I didn't have any problem with that vehicle at all related to traction in any weather.  BECAUSE I put decent tires on it!!!!\n\nFor my own vehicles, I usually get  tires that are rated high in traction but LOW on wear ratings.  These tires tend to be very noisy and not so great on fuel economy.  But they are usually great on performance, regardless of weather.  And I rotate the tires regularly and don't let the tread get too low.  The best tires in the world will be dangerous when the tread gets low.\n\nYOUR DAD probably would drive from New York to Colorado on bald tires.  And he might be OK.  Unless a dear jumps out in front of him.  Then he discovers the hard way that bald tires (especially in the front) don't allow you to stop or slow down very well.\n\nYour husband and parents are so gleeful to save a few bucks by driving on dangerous tires.  But what if a CHILD runs out in front of you and you can't stop because your tires are bald?  And then in the investigation, it is revealed that you knew your tires were bald a long time ago?  Now you are facing criminal charges and civil litigation.  Was it worth it to save a few bucks?\n\nDriving a car with bald tires is like driving a car with defective brakes.  It's reckless and irresponsible.", "NTA. Perhaps you were attracted to your husband because he was like your parents? Like the familiarity made you feel comfortable.\n\nFrom my experience, resentment is very difficult to come back from. If you want the marriage to survive you should look into marriage counselling.", "NTA. \n\nYou were absolutely right that the tires need to be fixed.  Your husband and your parents are wrong and if they are making you feel bad about pointing out out, then they are all AH. \n\nHonestly, this doesn't sound like a very healthy relationship  with many underlying issues.", "NTA\n\nBeing the responsible one is tough. Getting tires replaced, furnace checked, doctors appts set up etc. It\u2019s hard. \n\nMy husband knows this stuff needs to be done (he has ADHD) but his attention span gets the better of him sometimes so I set up and take care of things that need done. \n\nIn his defense he does other things to help out so it all evens out. \n\nBut having low tread and getting tires replaced is a safety issue!! A big one!! \n\nNot sure if you have kids yet, but if he gives you trouble remind him that his kids ride in that car and you care about about their safety.", "NTA. You have a right to your feelings about the situation, and the people in your circle don\u2019t have the right to judge you. Everyone grows up with different experiences, and not everyone will understand how much something (seemingly) simple actually affects another person. \n\nHopefully you and your husband can come to an agreement that you don\u2019t allow other people\u2019s opinions (like your parents) into your discussions. \n\nYou may have chosen a partner that is just like your parents because it feels comfortable, but if he doesn\u2019t respect your opinions and feelings then you\u2019ll be having fights like this your entire marriage. Resentment will build, and you\u2019ll both be unhappy. So do what is best for you! \n\nBest of luck!", "There's a legal minimum tread depth. It's 2/32\". If you've got less than that, you've got to replace the tires now. That's not an opinion - that's a legal requirement. If you've got more than that, but you're close to it, then it's time to think about a replacement. If you've got a lot more than that, then you're fine.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
