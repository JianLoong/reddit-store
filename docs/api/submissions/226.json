Your friend needs to make sure that the bird is properly rehomed and they owe you an apology. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  Taking care of a pet is a huge commitment.  Kudos to you for recognizing that you aren't ready.", "Absolutely NTA!  No one has the right to tell another person how to grieve or for how long.  You said you weren't ready, and he disregarded your wishes and tried to impose his wishes on you.  Tell me again why you're friends with this person?  Because he doesn't seem like a very good friend to me.", "NTA.  Your friend should respect your grieving period.", "NTA. The bond that one has with their animal is hard for people to understand. I'm so sorry for your loss, sweetheart. I really am. Bucky sounds like a special bird. \n\nMourning is hard. Some people heal with distraction, and some people need to feel the feelings/sit with the feelings. It's okay that you don't want to replace him. Your friend is likely focusing on the inconvenience it is to him to return the bird, which is very selfish of them. And it's on them for not listening to you when you said no before he even got the bird.", "NTA. Never, ever, ever give pets as a surprise gift. It's the rule for a reason, and it turns out to be cruel to both the recipient and the pet when things don't work out, which all too frequently they don't.\n\nThe new birdie still has time to find love, and a forever home. You do not have to take him on: he will be wanted and cherished in someone else's home.", "So long as neither you nor \u201cwell-meaning friend\u201d neglect new bird, NTA. I get that it takes time to recover from loss of a pet. You shouldn\u2019t allow that pain to justify neglect of a bird because you weren\u2019t ready to take ownership. Your friend needs to step up, take over.", "NTA. You were clear that you weren't emotionally ready for another pet, and your friend chose not to hear you.

A new bird is not a replacement, it is a differnet bird and has nothing to do with any other birds. You're not in a monogamic relationship to your ex-bird and you could have multiple birds without any of them being a replacement for anything. It's better if you drop the idea that you van love only one bird at a time.\n\nThat being said, giving pets as surprise presentd is wrong. So everone sucks here.", "Thank you, i felt like my feelings weren't valid and that I was just childish for grieving the loss of my best bud.", "As much as i dread the idea of having that responsibility thrown in my face, if \"friend\" doesn't rehome him, ill 100% care for him,. My heart would never let me sleep at night knowing that my friend neglected him. \n\nThank you.", "Thank you. I just know that im not ready for caring or taking responsibility for another pet, i also feel like i wouldn't be able to fully give the new bird the love he deserves so for the sake of him and my heart, I chose to not keep him.", "I said multiple times, I was dead serious and firm with what I said and he still did what he wanted.\n\nIm kinda of rethinking my whole friendship at the moment tbh", "Thats what got me, i feel like my worst heartache is just another day for said friend", "Thank you so much for your kind words, I appreciate you. Bucky was really special to me, he helped me with my worst and darkest times, he helped me see this life in a new lighter perspective and gave me a reason to wake up in the morning. \n\nThats why i felt real bad when my friend got me the new bird, I felt like he thought bucky was replaceable just like that.", "Thank you, i felt even more guilt because my friend's stupidity shouldn't be the bird's fault.\n\nI wish for a life full of love and happiness for the birdie, whether it was with me or in another home.", "I would never do that to an innocent bird, ever! Im considering keeping him because i don't trust my friend to care for him. \n\nHe too deserves as much love as bucky got.", "Thats all I wanted, just a bit of time to process my newly empty home. But apparently it didn't matter to \"friend\" \n\nThank you, im trying to find a middle ground for both me and the new birdie.", "I always felt like gifting animals without the consent of the receiver is kinda insensitive because you'll never know if the person is allergic, afraid or just not ready emotionally, physically or financially for it.", "I was trying so hard to stay strong for buck and to try and heal but after seeing the new tiel, it all came crumbling down my shoulders. The guilt, the anger and the sadness. I know that friends dont make their friends feel like this", "I am reconsidering alot of things now.", "Thank you! My friend failed to realize the fact that a bird's responsibility is as big as a dog's or cat's responsibility.", "If i hadn't lost my pet just 2 weeks ago, I'd find something to work it out, but him doing that to replace, its just cruel", "Thank you so much\n\nI loved him the moment I saw him, i just couldn't handle that and i was afraid of the thought of accidentally neglecting him.", "He did leave the bird in my house because as he said \"the bird is tired and deserves to rest\".\nI know for a fact he used my weak heart strings to manipulate me into keeping him.\nI cleaned and feed birdie, gave him some treats and now he's sound asleep in my room.

You do NOT give pets as gifts. This is known,  this is the way.", "Im trying to work something out, i don't want the bird to suffer because my friend doesn't know anything on how to care for them.", "But by my own emotions and heart, I can only love one bird at a time. Sure I have a soft spot for all animals but to care and commit to the responsibility, i can only do that to one, which was my buck.\n\nIts not an idea, its a feeling.", "If your \u201cfriend\u201d doesn\u2019t rehome him, you can always take it to a animal rescue. They would be able to screen qualified applicants. Please don\u2019t force yourself to accept a pet if you\u2019re not ready.", "I think I understand why it rubbed you all wrong like that. I'd feel the same way. You're not wrong for being upset that your friend isn't seeing and valuing what's important to you. I hope they wrap their head around it and support you as you need soon, you sweet soul. <3", "Not even a lil bit surprised by your answer. Believe me I get the anguish of grieving for those that went before. Literally just came out of a crying session for the cats I lost earlier this year. But you n me? We still give love to pets/animals that come after because a heart can be destroyed many times but still has capacity to love.", "I know how hard it is to lose beloved pets. Everyone grieves differently, so be kind to yourself & take as much time as you need.    I'm so sorry that your friend added to the weight already on your heart by putting you in this situation, and then responding with name-calling when you weren't compliant. Your reasons to return the bird are perfectly valid, and your friend's reaction & inability to understand would really make me question the friendship. Sadly, grief often forces us to reevaluate our other relationships.", "Exactly! And even in this case where they knew that OOP was capable of caring for the bird, that doesn't mean they want to again!", "It wouldn't be your responsibility. It would still be his until you AGREED.\n\nBut it is especially cruel when you're grieving.", "I appreciate my friend's good heart, and I know he had good intentions but im just not ready emotionally to got through the process all again", "Agreed.  The friend is a well meaning AH, but he is still an AH.  This situation is exactly why you never surprise somebody with a pet.  Even if you know for sure they want one, because they told you so, the only time it is ever OK is if they have picked out the specific pet they want and you are able to pay the adoption fee to get that pet for them.  Even, then, it is better to give them a head's up so they can get any supplies they might need.", "We dont have the same system here where i live, Only pet or bird shops.\n\nI have some people that are willing to take him, that I know they'll take good care of him. Ill give it some time to make 100% sure that he'll be well taken care of and loved", "Thank you so much, your words have touched my heart<33333\n\nIm working on myself currently, trying to find peace. I feel that my friend have ruined that but I still want to give him a chance to fix his mistake.", "Im so sorry for your cats, I feel you. I hope you're healing and finding peace. \n\nIm glad that you feel me too, the fact that we can never not love an animal/pet other than what we had. \n\nIt hurts even more because I feel like my friend took advantage of that.", "Thank you so much, i appreciate your sweet words.\n\nMy way of grieving was to distract myself, hiding toys/covering cage/putting pictures in a privet folder and overall trying to \"forget\" because the more I remembered my birdie's sweet presence, I also remembered the lack of it and it make me spiral. I was starting to accept and try to move on but now I feel like \"friend\" ruined it all.", "Thank you! I\u2019m getting there. I guess your friend overestimated your emotional capability in the moment but fully understands how big your heart is. You rock!", "Thank you so much! You rock too! I wish you a wonderful life filled with love, warmth and happiness and a great day/night!"]}
