I was a stay at home dad for 15 years, and time away from the entire family is something I highly recommend at least once a year.

He's amazing. Both moms can go suck rocks.", "NTA< but I would also remember that parents and grandparents have a hard time letting go of the old ways.

Your husband and the father of your child have your back and that is all that needs to matter in this situation", "NTA. Did your mom ever have the opportunity to go out by herself while you were growing up? Did his mom? They are probably bitter that you have a supportive husband who wants a happy wife. Usually when people are shocked that partners let their partners have lives outside of the relationship, it\u2019s like they\u2019re projecting their own trust issues onto you. You going to a concert is going to make your husband cheat on you? I hate when people project their crap out into the universe. I hope you get to go to many more concerts, maybe some with your husband!", "NTA, the grandparents can go blow eggs. You've been caring for your child for 2 years without a night off, you damn well earned that concert of baby sick alone and your husband must have agreed on that when you had a conversation about it.

Dry those eyes and don\u2018t let the pair of spoil sports ruin your enjoyment of a night out.  Make up your mind right now that you won\u2019t say such things to your daughter when she Is grown.  Sounds to me that you have a great husband.  He was able to have some alone time with his daughter and you were able to do something you enjoyed.  Sounds like a win, win situation to me.  Sometimes a little me time makes you a better wife and mother too.

Both your mothers are though. They have zero faith in your husband, both as a man and as a father.  Fathers don't 'babysit' their own kids, as your husband proved.

Do they really think so poorly of him as a man and a parent? Does your MIL think her son is going to abuse her?", "NTA. This was communicated between you and your husband and you were on the same page about your going with friends. Everyone needs that break in the regular routine to enjoy themselves. Are you supposed to stay home and tend the children until they\u2019re 18?", "Did your mom or MIL have careers?

I guarantee you they wouldn't say nothing to your husband. Put them in their place and let them know just because they didn't have freedom doesn't mean you can't and they have not right to judge.

Just make sure he gets similar opportunities- and that you both find time to chill together.", "Sounds like both mom & mil are both jealous they were shackled to their homes with zero freedom, time off, or support.", "Both mothers are insane and mean.

The older generation needs to realize that being a parent doesn\u2019t mean being attached to your kids 24/7, that adults have lives, and it\u2019s okay to take a break every so often.", "NTA. Good job giving your daughter an example of a good father/ partner. Your mil and mother are upset because they didn\u2019t have that when they had kids and it\u2019s hard to get out of that mindset. Sometimes you have to do things for yourself because you are more than just a mother and wife.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t abandon your daughter.

If so they are being ridiculous.", "NTA oh my God I swear I\u2019d be so livid if I had in-laws trying to throw their old fashioned beliefs into my face. You deserve that break and many more so honestly don\u2019t listen to them. Jeez. It would be a different story if you were leaving for more than a couple weeks but the only person whose opinions matter at this point is yours and your husband\u2019s, and you said he was not only supportive but encouraging, and I\u2019ve seen plenty of posts here about husbands being the opposite.

You deserve some \u201cme time\u201d. Your child was left with her father so she was not abandoned.", "NTA.  I wonder if there's a cultural thing going on here.  It isn't the done thing to leave the home for women in some cultures once married, are Mom and MIL from somewhere the expectation is different than it is for you?", "Your MIL and mother are of the generation and mindset that a woman's life stops as soon she has her first child and from thereon out, she's not allowed to be anything other than a mother. \n\nYeah, no to that. You went to a concert, you had fun. You're allowed to have a bit of downtime. Tell them both to butt out. \n\nAlso ... Do MILs actions mean she thinks her son is completely incompetent to take care of his own daughter for a few hours? If that's the case, great job raising him. \n\nI joke.

It's not like you just left your husband with your kid without warning. The two of you *agreed* to having him look after your kid while you went out with your friends.

That is a an amazing bond and marriage in itself. \n\nYour husband defending you to both your mother's trying to make them both apologize because he is an understanding considerate man, says everything!

He understands when I travel for work or great opportunities that I apply for to further my education. \nI was one of 15 teachers in the country to get accepted to a special program at Juilliard for a week intensive. My daughter was just about to be 5 and my son was just about to be 1 and I was still nursing. I had to wean him a couple weeks early (still plenty of milk stored for him). His family talked sooooo much trash about me leaving him for a week to go do this. IT WAS FRIGGING JUILLIARD. They were not proud of me or anything, just disgusted that I would even consider going. \nWe went NC until they all apologized and owned up to it. And really they only did so we would show up to Christmas Eve. They didn\u2019t think we were serious until we skipped Thanksgiving. His family does not do this kind of stuff and all basically live with their parents still - very failure to launch types. They just couldn\u2019t understand how I could \u201cstick my husband with HIS kids for a week.\u201d I told my husband he is the one that should really be insulted like he wasn\u2019t capable of being a parent. They have since backed off and don\u2019t say anything after that.", "NTA. Not at all. This is a sign of a happy, healthy marriage, where each partner gets to do things they still like doing while the other makes sure the home and kids are cared for.

They're a different generation. That doesn't excuse it at all. But they're basically mad that they couldn't do these things. You have an actual partner who is happy to parent his kids.

I'm sure if dad went out with his buddies, they wouldn't say a word, because in their minds, that's \"normal\", but why do they think that? Why isn't it normal for a father to take care of his kids? I just can't wrap my head around that kind of mentality. It's so regressive and backwards.\n\nMy wife even left the country for a month-and-a-half for work, and I took care of the kids by myself while she was gone. We had a blast. We went on all sorts of adventures around the city. And yes, sometimes I get looks from people when I am on the subway with my kids.
