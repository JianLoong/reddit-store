Your property is yours to do with as you choose.  This child is nothing to you, nothing of which you are responsible, nothing at all.

It\u2019s wrong of her to guilt you.", "NTA\n\nHer kid, her sacrifice. She put herself first enough. She needs to step up. She is still trying to blame others. \n\nKeep your shark. I'm closing in on 37 and I like stuffed animals. You are not too old.", "NTA - he's innocent in this, he's 3, but you are under no obligation to have any relationship at all with him. \n\nAnd your mom is a big AH for so many reasons.", "NTA. No, SHE should make sacrifices for him - as she should have for you - since she is a parent. You don't owe her stepson anything of yours.", "He isn\u2019t your brother.\n\nTell your mom she should focus on being there for him because she wasn\u2019t there for you and faced serious consequences.", "Nope, you are NTA for not wanting to give up something your GF gave you.  I'm 60F and I still have some of my stuffed animals from when I was small.  I hate when other people try to get you to give up your things.  This kid is not your stepbrother, you just met him a few years ago, he's your mother's partner's son that you barely see.  Tell her she can buy him a shark.", "\u201c..since his dad doesn\u2019t have any money.\u201d  Well dad and stepmom need to get a job or a second job.  They are the adults.  It\u2019s their responsibility to make sacrifices for their child.\n\nNTA.  Good for you for saying no.  Keep your boundaries.", "Nta.\nNot your kid. Not your responsibility . He's her kid and her responsibility.", "NTA. You totally get to choose how much of a relationship you have with him. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do in this situation", "Definitely NTA.  Obviously your mom has had issues from drug/alcohol abuse.  Even with recovery, people will keep the drama in their lives.  Sometimes, the drama replaces the high for them.  You are not responsible for your brother and by no means should you be asked to give him something of yours.  Good luck to you!", "NTA... you are in for a lifetime of manipulation from your birth mom. Best to learn to say no now.\n\nYou dont need to be told when or how to be nice to your step brother - but please dont take things out on him... he will have a hard upbringing", "NTA\n\nNot your monkeys, not your circus.\n\nThis all ready sounds like a winning situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a gift from your gf not just some stuffed toy you had hanging around (and even if it was its still rude to ask for it). & it\u2019s weird to ask you to have a relationship with a kid that you barely know.
