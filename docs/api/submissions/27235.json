It was a gift from your gf not just some stuffed toy you had hanging around (and even if it was its still rude to ask for it). & it\u2019s weird to ask you to have a relationship with a kid that you barely know. If he\u2019s still around in 5 years you might consider it, for now I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.", "So let me see if I have this straight... your biological mother who lost parental rights to you remarried and now has a 3 year old step-son. She wants you to give up the possessions you have received from your girlfriend for this child that you have nothing to do with? Yeah, that's a hard no. I personally would offer to purchase him some toys here and there for special occasions like birthdays and Christmas, but I would not be parting with my own property solely because your mother thinks that you're \"too old\" for them.", "I\u2019m definitely keeping my shark.", "maybe don't bring it round to hers anymore, i know from experiance he'll end up with one 'just the same!' that they 'bought' but you'll never find yours.", "Do.

OP, there is *nothing* you can do about whether or not she stays clean and sober, that is 100% on her and only on her.  \n\nYour life will be much better when you stop visiting her.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't even related to the kid. You have absolutely zero responsibility.

If she cares so much, your mum can go buy a toy herself for the child she agreed to take on.", "NTA.  Your mom is being unreasonable.  She could have asked you to maybe buy the kid a stuffed animal, to which you could say no, but it\u2019s worse to try to make you give him something of yours, especially if it was a gift to you. \n\nYou have no obligation to the kid, at all.  I feel bad for the little guy, sounds like the environment won\u2019t be stable if his dad is too broke to buy a stuffed toy. Big yikes.  Not your problem though.", "NTA He\u2019s not your brother, you don\u2019t have a relationship with the kid.", "Your Mum for a period of time obviously had substance abuse issues.

One of the other commenters was right - she is still showing her true colors, that is, of selfishness in her lack of caring for you. Also, I'm in my 50s and wouldn't give my stuffed animals away. You're never too old for stuffed animals!", "NTA and keep your shark. \n\nHe's not even your half brother. He's not related to you at all considering she lost all parental rights. \n\nShe has some nerve, demanding you sacrifice a treasured gift for a random child. His dad not having money is their problem, not yours.", "NTA Your mom was not asking about some vague future, she was, in the moment, asking you to give him a possession which has sentimental value for you. You are entirely correct in telling your mother that it is not your job to make up for the 2. y.o.'s dad financial inadequacies/inability to buy him certain toys.", "NTA\n\nKeep your shark. Even if he was your brother you would not owe him the gift you got from your gf. Your shark will be much happier with you!", "NTA- the kid is not your brother. You don\u2019t owe him anything.", "He's not your brother though, even if she wanted to argue he's your step-brother, she lost parental rights to you and basically isn't your parent anymore. Her marrying someone doesn't mean suddenly she is again and her new family is somehow your family\n\nNTA", "1: The shark is your property, so it's not up to her to give it away.\n\n2: She does not have the right to tell you what you are \"too old for.\"\n\n3: Her new husband and his inability to make enough money to afford a plushie for his son is not your problem.\n\nAll in all, even ignoring the emotional value of the shark, you are entirely in the right to tell her no.

Re-consider if you really want to continue to have a relationship with her. She doesn\u2019t sound pleasant to say the very least\u2026", "NTA\n\n \n>he is my brother\n\n No, he isn't.

Family is what you decide for yourself.", "He's not even her kid per se. This is a stepchild. That kid is solely his father's responsibility.

He has had to become more selective about his stuffed toy gifts for me because we are running out of spaces to put them.\n\nAs hard as it sounds, it might be time to sit down and think about whether or not it is going to hurt less cutting your mother out of your life. She is already showing signs of favouring your stepbrother at your expense. Only you know if this is a once off or a pattern of behaviour she is starting to show and if it is a new pattern it might be better to walk away now before you get too hurt.", "Does it have a name? Is it Feargal? OK you are far too young to call it that.", "Info: does the shark have a name?\n \nIf not, I suggest Finnegan.", "Nta. Your mom is ridiculous. It's not your responsibility to provide for her stepchild. \n\nIf anyone is going to be sacrificing for that child it's his parents not you. Even if your an adult you still not obligated to sacrifice anything for him. If your mom really wants to get him a stuff shark or any kind of toy. She and her husband have that responsibility to provide for him. \n\nThe next time you go over don't take anything nice with you or she might expect you to hand it over. \n\nJust know that shark is yours and if you ever choose to give it away that's for you to make that decision one else. But for now keep that shark safe.", "I appreciate you", "Honestly. I wouldn't bring yourself to her place either. It doesn't sound like you are benefiting from this relationship at all."]}
