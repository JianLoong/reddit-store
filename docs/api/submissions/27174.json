Aidan was a widower with two kids when they met. His daughter is now 14 and his son is now 13. Norah and Aiden had their daughter five months ago.\r\n\nAidan and his late wife were childhood sweethearts and their families were very close friends. This did not change after his late wife's death. They often get together and celebrate holidays or just to spend time together. Norah was made aware of this when she started dating Aidan. She was also told that would never change. Aidan said the families have became almost like one big family over the years and they would never exclude the others.\r\n\nNorah confided in me when she married Aidan that it was awkward seeing photos of his late wife at different ILs houses. Aidan's parents have a couple from when Aidan and his late wife were kids and some from when they were married and had the kids. Aidan's sister has childhood photos and adult photos of her and her late SIL, because they were best friends as kids. Norah said it felt like a message they were sending to her. I said they clearly loved Aidan's late wife and it was likely nothing to do with her. But some people keep photos of late loved ones up and some others will take them down. I suggested to her then that she should speak to a therapist because they were unlikely to remove traces of Aidan's late wife from their homes and lives and she might need some professional help learning to accept that.\r\n\nShe mentioned a few times over the five year marriage that she felt like Aidan's ILs (late wife's parents) did not embrace her as much as Aidan's family did and how much it bothered her. She brought up a lot that the kids always referred to her as step and shot her down hard when she suggested they could call her mom.\r\n\nIt was after Norah's daughter was born that she left me shocked. She and Aidan decorated the baby's room very late (last month actually) and I had wondered why because she was looking at all the inspo boards while pregnant. It was two weeks ago when she came over and started complaining that Aidan's ILs had gifted the nursery decorations for their grandchildren and she had held out waiting for them to do the same with her daughter's. She then complained that they were not treating her daughter like their grandchild and how they shouldn't all be one big happy family if that does not include her and her daughter fully. She said if they want to stick around they should treat her daughter the very same as they did/do their grandchildren. She said it must be their lack of treating her the same that has her stepkids saying she's a half sister and not just saying she's a sister.\r\n\nIt was after this I suggested my sister needed therapy because her expectations were so unrealistic that she had left me stunned. My sister said I should be on her side and telling her she needs therapy is saying she's wrong.

Did I read that right? His IL's, like his late wife's parents? Your sister wants HIS LATE WIFE'S PARENTS to pay for HER child!?\n\nWhile she can absolutely feel her feelings (not about being called step mom), especially being married for five years, but absolutely that is too far! And to make it out like blackmail, hell no.\n\n\nAnd hell no they don't need to embrace her as much as they embrace THEIR OWN DAUGHTER. wtf is wrong with her for that. \n\nYou are NTA, she definitely is after that last bit.", ">She brought up a lot that the kids always referred to her as step and shot her down hard when she suggested they could call her mom.\n\nShe is their step mum and trying to get them to call her otherwise is a horrible move\n\n>Aidan's ILs had gifted the nursery decorations for their grandchildren and she had held out waiting for them to do the same with her daughter's.\n\nSo she expected them to decorate a room for a child that isn't even their grandchild?\n\nNever mind sorting out unrealistic expectations if she doesn't sort herself out her marriage won't last. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your BIL\u2019s first wife didn\u2019t leave because she no longer loved her husband and family. She died. To expect her husband\u2019s first wife\u2019s parents and children to treat her as a replacement is so unrealistic it\u2019s mind boggling. \n\nIt sounds like the former in-laws welcomed her into their home. Your sister\u2019s pushiness is also more likely to push the kids away. They have to come to your sister on their terms. I hope the kids are allowed to have pictures of their mother in their house. Her expectations are bound to make her and everyone around her unhappy.", "NTA she needs a realist check asap. \n\nThe parents of the late wife aren\u2019t going to pay for the new wife\u2019s child! That is so ridiculous to even expect. Your sister does need therapy because her child is not their grandchild in any way.", "NTA\n\nShe can't expect the parents of the deceased's wife to decorate her child's bedroom.  That is insane.\n\nAlso it probably never crossed their mind because they would think that Norah's family would like to do that and they don't want to take away things from Norah's family.", "NTA. I can't stand the entitlement behind someone saying you should just take their side no matter what, especially after saying things that she did. Yikes! She knew going in what the story was and was told very bluntly that it would never change. She went forward with it and now wants it to change... Why do people do this???", "As her sister, you should be the first person to tell Norah the unvarnished truth, as you did.  She is being illogical and unreasonable.  \n\nNTA\n\nThis makes me think that Norah and Aidan did not do any pre-marital counseling.  That would absolutely been the time for Norah to share her expectations about her now-step children, in-laws, and Aidan's late wife's family.  In addition to Norah seeking therapy, she and Aidan should likely seek couples counseling so that they can have a neutral, knowledgeable referee to discuss this issues.", "NTA. \n> She then complained that they were not treating her daughter like their grandchild and how they shouldn\u2019t all be one big happy family if that does not include her and her daughter fully\n\nThis really shows how she\u2019s TA because they aren\u2019t even related and have not known her for long so why does she expect so much from them??", "NTA. Sounds like she's attempted to force a relationship with her step children and it's not going well for her. She's the reason their half siblings, not the grandparents. If she removes those grandparents from those kids lives A: it'd probably qualify as one of the rare scenarios grandparents rights actually exist, especially consider how old her step children are. So she's not going to get her way anyway. B: She's guaranteeing those children will never ever accept her as a parent by tearing her living family apart. \n\nIf anything you didn't say enough here. Your doing the right thing OP.", ">She mentioned a few times over the five year marriage that she felt like Aidan's ILs (late wife's parents) did not embrace her as much as Aidan's family did and how much it bothered her.\n\nSo, she's expecting a stranger to be treated as their daughter was. What was she expecting :D Yeah, NTA, she does have very unrealistic expectations. She doesn't understand why the pictures are where they are. They're not going to unperson their daughter because he got a new wife.", "You're NTA, in fact I think you did your sister (and her husband / dgter / steps etc) a big favour by puncturing her thought process. She desperately needed the reality check. \n\nWhen this occurs in my life and the other person seems to be in denial I tell myself it's like a message in a bottle, and they might think of it later when they can be more receptive. Good for you.", "You\u2019re NTA, but in some ways your sister is right. Not about the nursery, but if his in laws are always around, involved in all family gatherings, including the ones at her husband\u2019s family, they SHOULD treat the baby the same. Or they should visit their grandchildren separately. It\u2019s just basic kindness.", "NTA, and you are on her side by pointing out that she's not being realistic or fair. \n\nHer daughter isn't their granddaughter, and their grandchildren will be her half siblings. I can see why the constant reminders of deceased wife would be stressful, and there needs to be a discussion about that separately, but your sister is being unreasonable with the nursery.\n\nSadly OP, I have a feeling that you're going to lose no matter what you say because I think your sister wants someone to vent to and carte blanche support her views, not actually someone who will offer advice and solutions.", "NTA. I understand feeling insecure about a partner\u2019s deceased spouse, but expecting anything from her parents is absolutely bonkers. They lost their daughter, their grandchildren are their connection to her. Of course they\u2019re not going to treat your sister\u2019s child the same way, that\u2019s totally delusional. I\u2019m actually shocked at the expectation, like OP is.\n\nAlso, just a note from my own experience. Everyone has baggage to deal with, that\u2019s what you sign up for in a partnership. Being jealous, expecting unreasonable stuff, being generally hostile is going to get you left. That isn\u2019t to say you should just accept everything, but if you know the score beforehand, you really have no right to complain. Steer into the skid, or drive off, you can\u2019t have it both ways", "NTA - I can't even begin to imagine why she would think these people would have to treat her as if she is transplanted into the exact same role as her husband's late wife. She is a separate person and should relate to her family with the full knowledge and understanding of this. Pushing to take over the late wife's position is weird and will probably alienate everyone she tries it with.\n\nSomeone marrying someone who has had a life with a previous partner should be prepared to own that reality and relate to it with maturity and healthy boundaries. Her husband's late wife *is not her competition*, she's a previous chapter in his life and an important person to him and his family. Now that he has remarried, that doesn't erase this other person, that means he's ready to start a new chapter and expand his family.\n\nYour sister should be looking to the family she's directly related to if she wants favours, gifts and special treatment. Her own parents and her husband's parents are much more likely to be invested in her child than her husbands late wife's parents... who have grandchildren of their own as well as grief over their lost daughter that they need to navigate in their lives. Your sister should definitely talk to someone, therapy, or even counselling about how to maturely and healthily relate to blended families with respect and good boundaries.", "Going to therapy is not about being wrong or right. It about dealing with yourself and your feelings and issues. NTA", "You\u2019re absolutely correct. Her child already has two sets of grandparents, just as her step children have theirs. The claim that the families keep pictures of the late wife as a \u201cmessage\u201d to her is ridiculous and absolutely should be talked about with a therapist. It\u2019s not like she suddenly got blindsided and ambushed. She knew what she signed up for and made up those expectations herself. NTA", "Oh wow NTA.  I'm in the same boat as Norah.  My wife's late husband's family is still very involved in her and my step daughters lives.  I've never expected anything from any of them when it comes to doing or giving things with/to my childern.  They have at time and I'm extremely grateful for it, but to expect it is insane.", "NTA\n\nShe really should have done therapy before.", "NTA She is being ridiculous. On what planet would his dead wife\u2019s parents pay for HER baby items???? It doesn\u2019t make sense. This isn\u2019t their grandchild", "Nta yeah your sister has some serious issues his late wife family should not be involved in your sister child they have nothing to do with her", "NTA. \n\n\nBut maybe Aiden should be inviting people over instead of going over", "Info\nAre your parents alive? Are they involved in your sister's life? \nHas she been making them embrace her step D's over the past five years and make then the centre of your family?\n\nShe sounds a bit delusional, you might want to talk to her husband and talk to her kids privately.  She sounds like the type who is nasty and cruel to the stepkids in private while being sugary sweet in public.", "Nta she's not their daughter and her child isn't their grandchild. It amazes me that this theme comes up so often in reddit.", "Not everyone is a good match for a widow/widower precisely because you have to be ok with the memories of the deceased.\n\nIt sounds like the sister is one of these people and shouldn't have married him.\n\nSince that horse is out of the barn she should get some therapy, and maybe some couples counseling so she can communicate in a healthy way with her husband.  Maybe he can help her with her insecurities, and there might even be compromises that can be reached.  Telling someone to suck it up rarely works well even if it's warranted.\n\nI know that my ex hb was close to his ex in laws (divorced,  ex was alive) but the boundaries were poor and I never really felt included.  I never wanted him to cut them off and never would have dreamed of asking then to spend money on my kids, but there were things he could have done to make the boundaries a little better and to include me in things.  He still would have been able to have a relationship with them.\n\nHe refused and it's one reason we divorced.  The other was his cheating, but I digress. \n\n A counselor could help both of these two.", "I can kind of understand where the sister is coming from (kind of). It seems like a double standard that they want to be/act like one big happy family that includes everyone except when it comes to new wife and baby. The husband wants the ILs at the baby shower like a grandparent but then no one treats mum and bub like family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And yes: a therapist is a sensible step for someone lacking insight to this degree.", "I understand when she expected her mil and fil to pay ( if they did before ) but for late wife's family?The audacity!And entitlement!", "NTA\n\nThat family owes your sister nothing. But I think your words may have been too harsh.", "Norah needs to realise that it\u2019s not all about her. Aidan\u2019s late wife was special to all the people in her life and they are not going to \u2018file her away\u2019 just because Aidan has remarried. Also, she has no right to expect that the parents of her husband\u2019s late wife will see her child as their grandchild. She is being delusional. You are NTA.", "Don\u2019t marry a widower if you can\u2019t handle it.\n\nAnd her expectations are high for is Exinlaws.", "Yeah no shit telling her she needs therapy is telling her that she's wrong... because she's wrong!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Her expectations are nuts. She feels threatened by a dead woman and wants everything to just be normal, but it won\u2019t be. Blended families are complicated. She really needs to pursue therapy to sort out these feelings and set herself up for realistic expectations.", "Could you have approached it better? Probably. But, at the end of the day your sister does have some unrealistic expectations about her situation. It\u2019s okay to have feelings about the kids preferring to call her step-mom over mom or even feeling a little uncomfortable that there are a lot of reminders of the first wife around the in-laws places, but these are things you sort of need to just accept. \n\nAiden\u2019s first wife didn\u2019t leave him in a nasty divorce; she died. And when you marry a widower, especially one with children, you have to be secure enough with yourself and your relationship, because the deceased partner can\u2019t just be erased.\n\nIt sounds like your sister is just very focused on her own feelings, and either doesn\u2019t have the capacity or want to empathize with the people around her. Those kids may never call her \u201cmom\u201d, not because they hate her, but because they have a mom and want to keep her memory alive. They\u2019re also kids who might have difficult feelings about their dad remarrying and having another child. And it would be wild to expect deceased wife\u2019s parents pay for his second wife\u2019s kid or to pretend their daughter didn\u2019t exist so your sister can feel better. \n\nSo, I would say NTA. Again, there was maybe a more sensitive way to approach the subject, but it sounds like your sister is heading down a path where she\u2019s going to try to cut the deceased wife\u2019s parents out and make her husband choose sides. While therapy would be helpful, I don\u2019t think your sister is in a headspace to acknowledge she needs help in that way. Instead of saying she needs therapy, it might be better to say something like, \u201cit sounds like there\u2019s a lot of stuff you\u2019re dealing with right now, and it\u2019s taking an emotional toll on you. I\u2019m always happy to listen, but it might be really helpful to talk with someone who can give you strategies to manage these situations\u201d.", "Probably unpopular but YTA but it is a very tricky situation and you could be a little more understanding. I don't totally find a complete fault in her logic.\n\nHusband's ex in laws (late wife's parents) are not related to her at all, however she had to accept them and treat them like a \"big family\". However, it is unfair for her to not receive the same consideration back. If husband wants everybody to be a big family, he should also defend his wife and ask for the same treatment for her. Right now she is only giving, without receiving anything back. She had to accept the in laws, see them all the time, treat them like family, but the same is not applicable to her, she is just another woman. \n\nI know you will say she knew this before marrying her husband. Yes, she did. But I don't think she knew that husband will only expect her to work on that relationship. Also, a good husband will try to minimize the chances of his wife feeling like a non priority by small actions like maybe suggesting to his parents to add a picture of her as well on their wall, creating and adding new memories with her included, explain to his kids that a half sibling is still a sibling and try to remove this kind of wording etc. \n\nYou could definitely have more empathy for her and think if you were in her shoes, would you need some support and understanding or someone who constantly insists you you need therapy? You act like the only problem is her, you don't even acknowledge her struggles.", "So they have their big family and Norah can only look? I presume she was parenting his kids and they still think of her as \"father's wife\".\n\nShe is out of her line in few things ( late wife parents gifting decorations, taking down pictures with her ) but it can be a sign of deeper resentment she holds for this dead woman - she is doing her best and still not worth love from this big family she can only look at.\n\nYTA", "ESH.\n\n\nYour sister's expecting to take down pictures, being called their mom etc is outrageous. \n\n\nBut i don't think she wants to be treated the same. She wants her child to be treated equally. Given they are \"a big family\" they cannot have it both ways.", "NTA - Expecting the late wife\u2019s parents to view your sisters baby like their own grandchild is weird, but in all fairness no one in that family seems to have normal expectations or boundaries of blended families. Apparently they are all supposed to be \u201cone big happy family\u201d and do all the \u201chappy family\u201d things, but not make room for a new wife and child? How did the IL\u2019s *think* the widowers life would look like? \n\nYour sister *does* live in the shadow of a deceased spouse - a fact she is reminded of constantly - and everyone is making it clear that she\u2019s either simply *NOT* part of the \u201cbig, happy family\u201d or gaslighting her that she is and yet not treating her that way.", "YTA. I think your sister's feelings are valid. It can be tough dealing with constant reminders of a partner's late spouse. Maybe some therapy could help her cope, but implying she's \"wrong\" for feeling this way isn't the most empathetic approach.", "I feel like what you said was a little insensitive, borderline gaslighty, first of all.\n\nThere is a reason why people shy away from widows/ers. It's a very tough situation to be in. From what I've read about it, it seems common to feel \"2nd best\" to the deceased spouse. \n\nI think therapy is a good suggestion however I don't agree with your reason why.  I feel strongly you owe your sister an apology for that as well, or prepare for possible irreparable damage to your relationship.", "I can get wanting them, if they are going to be that involved, to treat people a certain way, like not emphasizing the technicalities like step or half. Like it seems reasonable that if they want to stay that involved they they make an effort to incorporate the new parts of the family in ways that don't drive a wedge further into the inherent rifts.\n\nBut expecting them to pay for the nursery is another thing altogether.\n\nI think\nYou are correct that your sister needs some healthy perspective work.\nBut her in laws really could use some work as well (assuming they're not)\n\nNTA", "NTA.
