Aidan was a widower with two kids when they met. His daughter is now 14 and his son is now 13. Norah and Aiden had their daughter five months ago.\r\n\nAidan and his late wife were childhood sweethearts and their families were very close friends. This did not change after his late wife's death. They often get together and celebrate holidays or just to spend time together. Norah was made aware of this when she started dating Aidan. She was also told that would never change. Aidan said the families have became almost like one big family over the years and they would never exclude the others.\r\n\nNorah confided in me when she married Aidan that it was awkward seeing photos of his late wife at different ILs houses. Aidan's parents have a couple from when Aidan and his late wife were kids and some from when they were married and had the kids. Aidan's sister has childhood photos and adult photos of her and her late SIL, because they were best friends as kids. Norah said it felt like a message they were sending to her. I said they clearly loved Aidan's late wife and it was likely nothing to do with her. But some people keep photos of late loved ones up and some others will take them down. I suggested to her then that she should speak to a therapist because they were unlikely to remove traces of Aidan's late wife from their homes and lives and she might need some professional help learning to accept that.\r\n\nShe mentioned a few times over the five year marriage that she felt like Aidan's ILs (late wife's parents) did not embrace her as much as Aidan's family did and how much it bothered her. She brought up a lot that the kids always referred to her as step and shot her down hard when she suggested they could call her mom.\r\n\nIt was after Norah's daughter was born that she left me shocked. She and Aidan decorated the baby's room very late (last month actually) and I had wondered why because she was looking at all the inspo boards while pregnant. It was two weeks ago when she came over and started complaining that Aidan's ILs had gifted the nursery decorations for their grandchildren and she had held out waiting for them to do the same with her daughter's. She then complained that they were not treating her daughter like their grandchild and how they shouldn't all be one big happy family if that does not include her and her daughter fully. She said if they want to stick around they should treat her daughter the very same as they did/do their grandchildren. She said it must be their lack of treating her the same that has her stepkids saying she's a half sister and not just saying she's a sister.\r\n\nIt was after this I suggested my sister needed therapy because her expectations were so unrealistic that she had left me stunned. My sister said I should be on her side and telling her she needs therapy is saying she's wrong.

Did I read that right? His IL's, like his late wife's parents? Your sister wants HIS LATE WIFE'S PARENTS to pay for HER child!?\n\nWhile she can absolutely feel her feelings (not about being called step mom), especially being married for five years, but absolutely that is too far! And to make it out like blackmail, hell no.\n\n\nAnd hell no they don't need to embrace her as much as they embrace THEIR OWN DAUGHTER. wtf is wrong with her for that. \n\nYou are NTA, she definitely is after that last bit.", ">She brought up a lot that the kids always referred to her as step and shot her down hard when she suggested they could call her mom.\n\nShe is their step mum and trying to get them to call her otherwise is a horrible move\n\n>Aidan's ILs had gifted the nursery decorations for their grandchildren and she had held out waiting for them to do the same with her daughter's.\n\nSo she expected them to decorate a room for a child that isn't even their grandchild?\n\nNever mind sorting out unrealistic expectations if she doesn't sort herself out her marriage won't last. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your BIL\u2019s first wife didn\u2019t leave because she no longer loved her husband and family. She died. To expect her husband\u2019s first wife\u2019s parents and children to treat her as a replacement is so unrealistic it\u2019s mind boggling. \n\nIt sounds like the former in-laws welcomed her into their home. Your sister\u2019s pushiness is also more likely to push the kids away. They have to come to your sister on their terms. I hope the kids are allowed to have pictures of their mother in their house. Her expectations are bound to make her and everyone around her unhappy.", "NTA she needs a realist check asap. \n\nThe parents of the late wife aren\u2019t going to pay for the new wife\u2019s child! That is so ridiculous to even expect. Your sister does need therapy because her child is not their grandchild in any way.", "NTA\n\nShe can't expect the parents of the deceased's wife to decorate her child's bedroom.  That is insane.\n\nAlso it probably never crossed their mind because they would think that Norah's family would like to do that and they don't want to take away things from Norah's family.", "NTA. I can't stand the entitlement behind someone saying you should just take their side no matter what, especially after saying things that she did. Yikes! She knew going in what the story was and was told very bluntly that it would never change. She went forward with it and now wants it to change... Why do people do this???", "As her sister, you should be the first person to tell Norah the unvarnished truth, as you did.  She is being illogical and unreasonable.  \n\nNTA\n\nThis makes me think that Norah and Aidan did not do any pre-marital counseling.  That would absolutely been the time for Norah to share her expectations about her now-step children, in-laws, and Aidan's late wife's family.  In addition to Norah seeking therapy, she and Aidan should likely seek couples counseling so that they can have a neutral, knowledgeable referee to discuss this issues.", "NTA. \n> She then complained that they were not treating her daughter like their grandchild and how they shouldn\u2019t all be one big happy family if that does not include her and her daughter fully\n\nThis really shows how she\u2019s TA because they aren\u2019t even related and have not known her for long so why does she expect so much from them??", "NTA. Sounds like she's attempted to force a relationship with her step children and it's not going well for her. She's the reason their half siblings, not the grandparents. If she removes those grandparents from those kids lives A: it'd probably qualify as one of the rare scenarios grandparents rights actually exist, especially consider how old her step children are. So she's not going to get her way anyway. B: She's guaranteeing those children will never ever accept her as a parent by tearing her living family apart. \n\nIf anything you didn't say enough here. Your doing the right thing OP.", ">She mentioned a few times over the five year marriage that she felt like Aidan's ILs (late wife's parents) did not embrace her as much as Aidan's family did and how much it bothered her.\n\nSo, she's expecting a stranger to be treated as their daughter was. What was she expecting :D Yeah, NTA, she does have very unrealistic expectations. She doesn't understand why the pictures are where they are. They're not going to unperson their daughter because he got a new wife.", "You're NTA, in fact I think you did your sister (and her husband / dgter / steps etc) a big favour by puncturing her thought process. She desperately needed the reality check. \n\nWhen this occurs in my life and the other person seems to be in denial I tell myself it's like a message in a bottle, and they might think of it later when they can be more receptive. Good for you.", "You\u2019re NTA, but in some ways your sister is right. Not about the nursery, but if his in laws are always around, involved in all family gatherings, including the ones at her husband\u2019s family, they SHOULD treat the baby the same. Or they should visit their grandchildren separately. It\u2019s just basic kindness.", "NTA, and you are on her side by pointing out that she's not being realistic or fair. \n\nHer daughter isn't their granddaughter, and their grandchildren will be her half siblings. I can see why the constant reminders of deceased wife would be stressful, and there needs to be a discussion about that separately, but your sister is being unreasonable with the nursery.\n\nSadly OP, I have a feeling that you're going to lose no matter what you say because I think your sister wants someone to vent to and carte blanche support her views, not actually someone who will offer advice and solutions.", "NTA. I understand feeling insecure about a partner\u2019s deceased spouse, but expecting anything from her parents is absolutely bonkers. They lost their daughter, their grandchildren are their connection to her. Of course they\u2019re not going to treat your sister\u2019s child the same way, that\u2019s totally delusional. I\u2019m actually shocked at the expectation, like OP is.\n\nAlso, just a note from my own experience. Everyone has baggage to deal with, that\u2019s what you sign up for in a partnership. Being jealous, expecting unreasonable stuff, being generally hostile is going to get you left. That isn\u2019t to say you should just accept everything, but if you know the score beforehand, you really have no right to complain. Steer into the skid, or drive off, you can\u2019t have it both ways", "NTA - I can't even begin to imagine why she would think these people would have to treat her as if she is transplanted into the exact same role as her husband's late wife. She is a separate person and should relate to her family with the full knowledge and understanding of this. Pushing to take over the late wife's position is weird and will probably alienate everyone she tries it with.\n\nSomeone marrying someone who has had a life with a previous partner should be prepared to own that reality and relate to it with maturity and healthy boundaries. Her husband's late wife *is not her competition*, she's a previous chapter in his life and an important person to him and his family. Now that he has remarried, that doesn't erase this other person, that means he's ready to start a new chapter and expand his family.\n\nYour sister should be looking to the family she's directly related to if she wants favours, gifts and special treatment. Her own parents and her husband's parents are much more likely to be invested in her child than her husbands late wife's parents... who have grandchildren of their own as well as grief over their lost daughter that they need to navigate in their lives. Your sister should definitely talk to someone, therapy, or even counselling about how to maturely and healthily relate to blended families with respect and good boundaries.", "Going to therapy is not about being wrong or right. It about dealing with yourself and your feelings and issues. NTA", "You\u2019re absolutely correct. Her child already has two sets of grandparents, just as her step children have theirs. The claim that the families keep pictures of the late wife as a \u201cmessage\u201d to her is ridiculous and absolutely should be talked about with a therapist. It\u2019s not like she suddenly got blindsided and ambushed. She knew what she signed up for and made up those expectations herself. NTA", "Oh wow NTA.  I'm in the same boat as Norah.  My wife's late husband's family is still very involved in her and my step daughters lives.  I've never expected anything from any of them when it comes to doing or giving things with/to my childern.  They have at time and I'm extremely grateful for it, but to expect it is insane.", "NTA\n\nShe really should have done therapy before.", "NTA She is being ridiculous. On what planet would his dead wife\u2019s parents pay for HER baby items???? It doesn\u2019t make sense. This isn\u2019t their grandchild", "Nta yeah your sister has some serious issues his late wife family should not be involved in your sister child they have nothing to do with her", "NTA. \n\n\nBut maybe Aiden should be inviting people over instead of going over", "Info\nAre your parents alive? Are they involved in your sister's life? \nHas she been making them embrace her step D's over the past five years and make then the centre of your family?\n\nShe sounds a bit delusional, you might want to talk to her husband and talk to her kids privately.  She sounds like the type who is nasty and cruel to the stepkids in private while being sugary sweet in public.", "Nta she's not their daughter and her child isn't their grandchild. It amazes me that this theme comes up so often in reddit.", "Not everyone is a good match for a widow/widower precisely because you have to be ok with the memories of the deceased.\n\nIt sounds like the sister is one of these people and shouldn't have married him.\n\nSince that horse is out of the barn she should get some therapy, and maybe some couples counseling so she can communicate in a healthy way with her husband.  Maybe he can help her with her insecurities, and there might even be compromises that can be reached.  Telling someone to suck it up rarely works well even if it's warranted.\n\nI know that my ex hb was close to his ex in laws (divorced,  ex was alive) but the boundaries were poor and I never really felt included.  I never wanted him to cut them off and never would have dreamed of asking then to spend money on my kids, but there were things he could have done to make the boundaries a little better and to include me in things.  He still would have been able to have a relationship with them.\n\nHe refused and it's one reason we divorced.  The other was his cheating, but I digress. \n\n A counselor could help both of these two.", "I can kind of understand where the sister is coming from (kind of). It seems like a double standard that they want to be/act like one big happy family that includes everyone except when it comes to new wife and baby. The husband wants the ILs at the baby shower like a grandparent but then no one treats mum and bub like family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And yes: a therapist is a sensible step for someone lacking insight to this degree.", "I understand when she expected her mil and fil to pay ( if they did before ) but for late wife's family?The audacity!And entitlement!", "NTA\n\nThat family owes your sister nothing. But I think your words may have been too harsh.", "Norah needs to realise that it\u2019s not all about her. Aidan\u2019s late wife was special to all the people in her life and they are not going to \u2018file her away\u2019 just because Aidan has remarried. Also, she has no right to expect that the parents of her husband\u2019s late wife will see her child as their grandchild. She is being delusional. You are NTA.", "Don\u2019t marry a widower if you can\u2019t handle it.\n\nAnd her expectations are high for is Exinlaws.", "Yeah no shit telling her she needs therapy is telling her that she's wrong... because she's wrong!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Her expectations are nuts. She feels threatened by a dead woman and wants everything to just be normal, but it won\u2019t be. Blended families are complicated. She really needs to pursue therapy to sort out these feelings and set herself up for realistic expectations.", "Could you have approached it better? Probably. But, at the end of the day your sister does have some unrealistic expectations about her situation. It\u2019s okay to have feelings about the kids preferring to call her step-mom over mom or even feeling a little uncomfortable that there are a lot of reminders of the first wife around the in-laws places, but these are things you sort of need to just accept. \n\nAiden\u2019s first wife didn\u2019t leave him in a nasty divorce; she died. And when you marry a widower, especially one with children, you have to be secure enough with yourself and your relationship, because the deceased partner can\u2019t just be erased.\n\nIt sounds like your sister is just very focused on her own feelings, and either doesn\u2019t have the capacity or want to empathize with the people around her. Those kids may never call her \u201cmom\u201d, not because they hate her, but because they have a mom and want to keep her memory alive. They\u2019re also kids who might have difficult feelings about their dad remarrying and having another child. And it would be wild to expect deceased wife\u2019s parents pay for his second wife\u2019s kid or to pretend their daughter didn\u2019t exist so your sister can feel better. \n\nSo, I would say NTA. Again, there was maybe a more sensitive way to approach the subject, but it sounds like your sister is heading down a path where she\u2019s going to try to cut the deceased wife\u2019s parents out and make her husband choose sides. While therapy would be helpful, I don\u2019t think your sister is in a headspace to acknowledge she needs help in that way. Instead of saying she needs therapy, it might be better to say something like, \u201cit sounds like there\u2019s a lot of stuff you\u2019re dealing with right now, and it\u2019s taking an emotional toll on you. I\u2019m always happy to listen, but it might be really helpful to talk with someone who can give you strategies to manage these situations\u201d.", "Probably unpopular but YTA but it is a very tricky situation and you could be a little more understanding. I don't totally find a complete fault in her logic.\n\nHusband's ex in laws (late wife's parents) are not related to her at all, however she had to accept them and treat them like a \"big family\". However, it is unfair for her to not receive the same consideration back. If husband wants everybody to be a big family, he should also defend his wife and ask for the same treatment for her. Right now she is only giving, without receiving anything back. She had to accept the in laws, see them all the time, treat them like family, but the same is not applicable to her, she is just another woman. \n\nI know you will say she knew this before marrying her husband. Yes, she did. But I don't think she knew that husband will only expect her to work on that relationship. Also, a good husband will try to minimize the chances of his wife feeling like a non priority by small actions like maybe suggesting to his parents to add a picture of her as well on their wall, creating and adding new memories with her included, explain to his kids that a half sibling is still a sibling and try to remove this kind of wording etc. \n\nYou could definitely have more empathy for her and think if you were in her shoes, would you need some support and understanding or someone who constantly insists you you need therapy? You act like the only problem is her, you don't even acknowledge her struggles.", "So they have their big family and Norah can only look? I presume she was parenting his kids and they still think of her as \"father's wife\".\n\nShe is out of her line in few things ( late wife parents gifting decorations, taking down pictures with her ) but it can be a sign of deeper resentment she holds for this dead woman - she is doing her best and still not worth love from this big family she can only look at.\n\nYTA", "ESH.\n\n\nYour sister's expecting to take down pictures, being called their mom etc is outrageous. \n\n\nBut i don't think she wants to be treated the same. She wants her child to be treated equally. Given they are \"a big family\" they cannot have it both ways.", "NTA - Expecting the late wife\u2019s parents to view your sisters baby like their own grandchild is weird, but in all fairness no one in that family seems to have normal expectations or boundaries of blended families. Apparently they are all supposed to be \u201cone big happy family\u201d and do all the \u201chappy family\u201d things, but not make room for a new wife and child? How did the IL\u2019s *think* the widowers life would look like? \n\nYour sister *does* live in the shadow of a deceased spouse - a fact she is reminded of constantly - and everyone is making it clear that she\u2019s either simply *NOT* part of the \u201cbig, happy family\u201d or gaslighting her that she is and yet not treating her that way.", "YTA. I think your sister's feelings are valid. It can be tough dealing with constant reminders of a partner's late spouse. Maybe some therapy could help her cope, but implying she's \"wrong\" for feeling this way isn't the most empathetic approach.", "I feel like what you said was a little insensitive, borderline gaslighty, first of all.\n\nThere is a reason why people shy away from widows/ers. It's a very tough situation to be in. From what I've read about it, it seems common to feel \"2nd best\" to the deceased spouse. \n\nI think therapy is a good suggestion however I don't agree with your reason why.  I feel strongly you owe your sister an apology for that as well, or prepare for possible irreparable damage to your relationship.", "I can get wanting them, if they are going to be that involved, to treat people a certain way, like not emphasizing the technicalities like step or half. Like it seems reasonable that if they want to stay that involved they they make an effort to incorporate the new parts of the family in ways that don't drive a wedge further into the inherent rifts.\n\nBut expecting them to pay for the nursery is another thing altogether.\n\nI think\nYou are correct that your sister needs some healthy perspective work.\nBut her in laws really could use some work as well (assuming they're not)\n\nNTA", "NTA.

These kids are the children of a family member who is no longer here and your sister cannot fill that void.

It is healthy and important for them not to be alienated from their maternal grandparents!\n\nSister 100% needs a personal therapist *and* a marriage counselor. Her expectations of the other in-laws is incredibly inappropriate. But it's also understandable for her to feel left out. And her husband should be working to include her if he wants them all to truly be \"one big family.\" But that family has endured a terrible tragedy. Your sister needs help dealing with her jealousy, because it is unreasonable to expect Aiden's in-laws to treat her like their own tragically deceased daughter. \n\nIf she can learn to embrace the family she intentionally married into, she might find more acceptance from her step-children and their grandparents.", "I think your sister has a bit of a point, though she is being extreme in her exact tit for tat expectations.\n\nIf the late wife's parents are integrated as part of the core family this strongly then you can't have them treating the new child less than they do the others. It will just lead to the new child feeling excluded and inadequate. If Aiden is truly part of that family, then his new daughter needs to be treated as a full grandchild of the family as well.", "She\u2019s got unrealistic expectations. It almost sounds like she wants everyone to forget the other woman existed and wants to replace her completely. That\u2019s just not going to happen. They have every right to love her memory, also while embracing and supporting the new relationship. That doesn\u2019t mean they have to pay for the nursery decorations for the new baby. You were right to suggest therapy because her head isn\u2019t straight. She\u2019s jealous of a woman who passed away. NTA", "NTA to op obviously, but what I\u2019m gonna say is going to be an unpopular opinion I think. So, of course his late wife\u2019s parents aren\u2019t obligated in any way to pay for her nursery or anything like this. This is an unreasonable expectation. Therapy would be great for her to deal with some of her frustration because it\u2019s not an easy situation to be in regardless of the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nWith all of that said, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s completely wrong when it comes to how she\u2019s feeling. She was told from the get go that this is one big happy family, that she needs to accept it, that everyone has the same importance, so to suck it up her discomfort about the whole thing, but then she also needs to accept that she and her daughter are not part of this big happy family and they aren\u2019t considered the same as the rest and they don\u2019t hold the same importance? Which one is it? Her husband can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nSo I think he needs to accept that *he* might consider his late wife\u2019s parents as family, but your sister is not obligated to in any way whatsoever. She should respect them in terms of the importance they hold for her husband and his kids, and because they are her husband and her stepchildren family, but they *are not her family*, and if that distinction is understood in terms of the late wife\u2019s parents not treating her as such (as it should), it also should be understood that your sister will not consider them like that either. They aren\u2019t her husband\u2019s parents or blood relatives, and she doesn\u2019t need to treat them the same way she treats her in laws for example. They aren\u2019t, afterall, \u201ca big happy family\u201d, and that\u2019s totally fine, as long as it is valid for both sides.", "YTA a little bit even if you are mostly right.\n         \nYour sister has been asked to have her husband's late wife in her life to an extent that is above and beyond. If it were not above and beyond, she would not even KNOW that his other ILs had gifted his children nursery decorations.\n\n          \nGiven how much of time your sister has had to invest in them, I can see why she had the expectation. I honestly think her mistake was marrying her husband, and that is now compounded by them having a child.\n         \nHer husband has not moved on, and she is now stuck in amber with him. It seems very, very sad.", "I think you need to listen with your third ear. \n\nWhat your sister really wants is the support of family. She has a newborn. Wanting support from family is not a toxic or crazy thing to desire. It is a natural, survival instinct.\n\nAnd to be surrounded by a big, loving, supportive family, but not be within that big loving supportive family, must feel really, really painful. And will screw with your head if you don\u2019t have your own big, loving, supportive family to counterbalance that.\n\nYou\u2019re right, she does need therapy.  \n\nWhen your sister told you she expected them to fill the nursery, she was really saying she wished her own family would do it. She was essentially reaching out to you bc she wanted support and help, but she did it in a very indirect, screwed up way, and you responded by telling her to get help elsewhere. I suspect there is a family history of not being able to ask for needs to be met. And her asking the kids to call her mom is misguided, but again, I think she is desperate to feel a part of a family, and right now she honestly probably just feels like a concubine.\n\nYour sister needs therapy, but she also clearly needs the support of her extended family (including you) to surround her and her newborn. Why didn\u2019t you and your parents set up the nursery? I think that your sister was really hoping that you and your parents would step in and support and love her growing family, just like her husband\u2019s widow\u2019s family did for him and his late wife.\n\nWhile it is necessary that she seek therapy to deal with these emotions, it is just as important that you and your family surround, support, and envelop that baby with the kind of love that your sister sees the other family giving.", "So.. your sister is jealous of a ghost, and expects everybody to embrace and replace that ghost.. with her..?

Her unrealistic expectations prevent the very thing she wants", "I really hope that your sister listens to you. She will only harm her relationships with everyone with this attitude. Why does she think her husband's late wife's *parents* should treat her the same? That is their late daughter, their child. \n\nHer stepchildren's feelings are also something she needs to accept.

Expecting them to do so is definitely Norah's issue to deal with. As for Norah's kids they have a mom and she's dead. They have no interest in replacing her. Your sister does need therapy because she needs to understand her place in her stepchildren lives.", "NTA. She does need some professional outside perspective to accept the boundaries her husband and his family have.\n\n\nBUT I think the new baby is going to open up some real dialogue between her and her husband. It sounds like they both want to have a big happy family, but have different ideas of what that looks like because Aiden already has a big happy family. Here's hoping the therapist can help open the lines of communication.", "Therapy would absolutely help with her insecurities here.  She needs to stop feeling threatened by a dead woman.  Of course their dearly departed daughter/wife/mom/etc. wasn\u2019t erased from their homes like a dead pharaoh having their names chipped from obelisks by jealous successors.  If Aidan married & had a child with her, she needs to trust that she\u2019s loved fully here, even if it\u2019s not the exact way she would prefer (especially since expectations sound like they were laid out well in advance).  I can understand her disappointment if she feels like an outsider, but unless there\u2019s actual exclusionary slights from them (and not just the nursery thing - that\u2019s weird) she needs to chill.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I kind of feel bad for her because that is such a bizarre situation to be in, and I can see how confusing and conflicting it would be from her perspective. Mainly because she\u2019s being told that it\u2019s basically one big combined family now, but to her that is very untrue.\n\nNow expecting a nursery be paid for from people who aren\u2019t related is strange and honestly comes across as a manic attempt to force what she wants.\n\nI think someone needs to sit her down and blatantly explain how things actually are so she can have normal expectations, and not explain it in a way that confuses her.

There are some parts that you are right, Norah isn\u2019t being realistic but there are some parts she\u2019s right that the ILs also need some nudging over their lack of sensitivity. \n\nFirst of all, you are right that Norah went in with her eyes open. She shouldn\u2019t be seeking to replace Aidan\u2019s dead wife in the eyes of the wife\u2019s children and also the dead wife\u2019s family. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s also right in that the dead wife\u2019s family is being unnecessarily discriminatory, in the sense that since Aidan had grown up with them and they treat him like a son, then any children he has regardless of whether the child is related to them by blood or not should be treated on the merit of the strength of their ties with him, and not because the child isn\u2019t their daughter\u2019s. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear that Norah did not break up their dead daughter\u2019s marriage. I\u2019m assuming she only met Aidan after the wife\u2019s death. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case then Norah is right in that the dead wife\u2019s family does seemingly draw lines and isn\u2019t gracious when it comes to the children. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing for the older children not to address Norah as mum, but quite another for them to insist that they MUST address Norah\u2019s child as HALF-sister. \n\nNorah\u2019s child is still their sister, and to go down to such precision that her child be addressed as HALF-sister smacks of hostility and tension.

Period.\n\nFirst off, your sister shouldn't expect the approval of the deceased wife's parents to the degree you stated - f.e., expecting them to gift her the nursery. Yes, one big family between them and Aidan's parents, but still. They don't owe her anything but, you know, basic respect.\n\nI'm also getting weird vibes from your sister being off-put by the pictures and such of the deceased wife. It's a whole different ball of string when a father is single because he is WIDOWED. Her taking things like that as \"a message they were sending to her\" just reads as narcissism to me. I'm NOT diagnosing her obviously, so take that as a grain of salt and be careful with it, but keep that possibility in mind.\n\nIf that's the case, something to remember: narcissists deflect problems (they won't admit they're in the wrong), and for this reason will avoid getting help. Furthermore, they will make you feel bad for pointing these things out. Do NOT feel bad. And for Norah - she can get help. There is hope. You opening the conversation about her needing therapy is a step in the right direction. As long as you're coming from a loving, understanding place, you're showing her an out.\n\nIn Norah's defense, I do feel bad for her - of course it's understandable to feel excluded in this situation - but again, all you're doing is asking her to go to therapy, which I think she would benefit from.\n\nBut something to remember - MAINTAIN YOUR BOUNDARIES. Boundaries are everything. Sending you love, OP.", "NTA\n\nI can never get over how someone can think that they should 100% replace a dead wife/husband like they never existed??

Can she (or you for that matter) do something for your sister so she would feel cherished and important?\n\nIf it's possible to strengthen the bond between your side of the family, that'd do her good. If her husband's family are the people they socialize with the most, I cannot blame her for feeling secondary. Therapy could help, but also, you (and your family) can help.\n\nAlso , also: what's your relationship with the step-niblings? Will you treat the baby the same way you do them? Does your sister expect you to?", "NTA sister does need therapy. The only appropriate boundary she may have is in reference to removing the half in the sibling part. Maybe. If that is important to her, I think she can set the boundary/preference that they just call each other siblings. The siblings are old enough to not be confused and they can have a preference but if you want grandparents to stop saying \u201chalf sibling\u201d for whatever reason, I could make an argument that that may be beneficial to younger sibling in terms of defining family.

Also her thinking that all the ILs are sending her some kind of message by having pictures of the deceased wife around most likely way off.  She needs to understand that though his first wife has passed on people are not just going to forget her.  She was loved, she was part of the family, she is the mother of 2 of their grandchildren.  Keeping pictures of deceased loved ones out is pretty normal.  I'm guessing your sister feels threatened by her husbands previous wife and that it is negatively impacting how she's perceiving things, such as why her step kids don't want to call her mom.

They also need couples counseling and that should have taken place before they got married because while your sister definitely has some unrealistic and unreasonable expectations, Aiden, his family and his late wife's family do as well.  Your suckage is for suggesting that she gets counseling because you think her feelings are totally invalid and want a therapist to tell her that, not because you want to see her address the issue in a healthy way. \n\nThe reality is that this \"one big happy family\" dynamic only works in a healthy way if everyone in it is actually treated like an equal member of it and it's obvious that this isn't the case.  What the dynamic really is is that \"they\" are a happy family and anyone Aiden chooses to be with is an outsider expected to cater to it because they don't want their dynamic to change and it's not healthy or reasonable. Your sister is not wrong to be upset over the double standard.  She should have peaced out of that nonsense but they are married with a baby now and so the problem needs to be addressed.  It's great that they all love eachother and kept things as normal for the kids as possible after their mother passed but once Aiden decided to remarry and have another child he is now obligated to make sure his wife and child are treated properly and that his immediate family is in a happy and healthy place.  No matter what unrealistic things he said before marriage, he changed the dynamic of their family by getting married and adding another baby and they are just as important as everyone else in that family.  All of the other adults suck for failing to be reasonable and realistic here and they are doing a disservice to all of the children involved.

She was ALSO mom now. \n\nAnd even though eventually our relationship soured over the years over different things, I can never not respect her. Because she took on the job, knowing it was a rather thankless one, with three (pre-)pubescent children who desperately needed her.  She got hurt plentiful along the way, which I know now that I\u2019m older. It actually made me make a stand against my (original? Bio? I can never quite figure out the respectful term) mom\u2019s family because they did not treat her decently and I wouldn\u2019t stand for that. \n\nBecause if they loved me, she was a part of that. \n\nAnd even then, she really didn\u2019t want me to cut things off, because they were my last connection to my mom\u2019s youth and most things about her. \n\nShe\u2019s a class act, that woman.

She really should have worked through this, and made sure she was comfortable with the dynamic before getting married.

This tells me a lot about how much OP's sister has been made to feel like family and how she is viewed by the IL's and her stepchildren. It's complicated to be a stepmother to children who lost their mom, but it does seem like OP's sister is being held at arms length in certain regards.\n\nI understand they are grieving, but if OP's BIL is like a son to the in-laws and the in-laws want everyone to be one big family, then his wife should be treated like a DIL and his daughter should be treated like a granddaughter.", "Yeah that was my first thought too.

Siccing a couples counselor on him is likely to become a confrontation, which is deeply unfair given she hasn't been honest about her feelings. She's been internalizing it, seething in private (OP has used words like \"she hates it\"), and venting to OP as her only emotion management.

I think Norah and Aiden would benefit from some family counseling to have open conversations about expectations, ideals, and feelings, and find a new dynamic that works for both of them.\n\nNorah should not be expected to be a pushover or excluded from her own family, which includes the in laws (which is the vibe I get from how she's feeling at least) but she also shouldn't have such expectations of the in laws either.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have married him.

It wasn't that there were pictures of the late wife that gave her the idea they didn't want her around, it was their words and actions. The pictures are just a catalyst that solidified those into a tangible thought. The whole mom/stepmom thing is just part of the feelings of being the outsider. You would think being in their lives at least 5+ years starting when they were 8/9 they might consider calling her mom. Of course if someone, say a grandparent, has corrected the kids from calling her mom and reinforced that she is a stepmom that would put a finger on the scale. I can just imagine how devastated she was when they said \"No, you're stepmom\". From outsider to the extended family to outsider in your own house.\n\nOP is right for the wrong reasons.

Then, in reality, after some time the mess explodes.\n\nPersonally I think this is strongly an ESH situation. \"One big family\" and \"excluding the new wife\" can't go together. And you may ask \"ok but vivianlight, how do you expect the late wife's parents to embrace the new wife?\". And my answer is that they shouldn't, because there shouldn't be this \"one big family\" situation to begin with. They should keep the existing relationships (with the previous children) and the cordial new ones, but this mess of forced \"big family\" can't work. Right now, it's basically forced on OP's sister without actually including her... it's stupid. How could OP's sister develop barriers and boundaries if she can't physically have those boundaries and barriers? You are forcing her to accept a psychologically weird situation in which she has to accept a big family (which she seems ok with) while at the same time being excluded from it (which is where she explodes, leading to reactions and requests that still out her in the ESH mix). At the beginning of the post it's said that the husband said that the families are basically one big family and won't separate... but OP's sister IS family, their son IS family. I honestly understand the problem here, it's a mental trap basically.

Treating Norah EXACTLY the same in all ways as their dead daughter (and her child vs. their daughter\u2019s children), even outside of this ridiculous and entitled nursery issue (that clearly begs the question what insane thing is next that she\u2019s going to freak out about) is a really, really high bar that most people could not meet.

This stepmom kind of reminds me of this post that I saw where this woman was so jealous of the previous wife who had died and wanted the step children to accept her and call her mom, and basically erase their mom...she was so jealous to the point that she went up into the attic and got all of the children's dead mother's stuff and burned it, took the pictures they had out of their rooms of their dead mother burned them, the letters that the mom had written to her children before she died she burned them.. this girl is not too far from that.. I just don't see this ending well \ud83d\ude15", "of course it will !!! I mean the kids are teenagers then they will have their own families before  this poor new kid is grown and the grandparents will shower their greatgrand kids and spend time with their great grand kids .

There's nothing weird about the kids' grandparents (husband's ILs) wanting to be at birthdays, holidays, etc. for their grandkids and still not wanting to be close to OP's sister. But if OP's sister's husband is going to act like they're one big blended family, then the ILs need to be in on it too, and they need to treat the new wife as part of that blended family by going to her parties just the same.\n\nI can't help but wonder if it's the husband that's trying to push the blended family idea because he isn't ready to let go of his late wife's family.

But what OPs sister is asking makes no sense to me. The late wife\u2019s parents decorated those nurseries for their grandchildren. The new baby isn\u2019t a grandchild. She might become something close, but that\u2019s not something you can force.", "Yeah i agree, the timing of my mum's pregnancy with youngest sibling was TERRIBLE, but she stuck to her promise not to make me babysit and my stepdad didn't try to be my dad or treat me like i wasn't welcome. They basically minimised the impact it was going to have on me, and i've always adored my little sibling. Don't consider him any less than what my full siblings are to me, and once I was an adult I happily babysat voluntarily. If you try to force anything on a teenager they are going to strike back by doing the opposite with a force so vigorous that literally nothing can break their resolve haha.", "I was thinking kinda the same thing. Wonder if now that the baby is coming, if she will push for less time at the ILs. As the child ages she will push how it is damaging their child as the baby isn't treated the same.

The 2 older kids are STILL their grandkids, and not only that, along with their relationships with Adrian\u2019s parents and Adrian himself, the only living, changing thing they have left of their DEAD daughter.    \n\n\nNorah and Adrian will have to tell this new baby when they are old enough to understand that their two older siblings have (not had, HAVE) a different mom and different grandparents. It will not and cannot be a secret. Hence, perfect equalness in everything (except you agree not for financial stuff, which I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d draw the line there) is not necessarily *equity*. I just really think that bar is too high in this case, and the kids will all be able to understand because there are also other grandparents for the new baby. Again, I agree they should not be cold, unwelcoming, unkind, or othering to Norah and the new baby, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to or even could treat them exactly the same.  *Adrian\u2019s* parents should, sure!", "It\u2019s a f\u2019ing shower.

She was a preteen. When I was a teenager, she gave birth to her first born and I was always eager to hold him and shower him with love and attention. You can't generalize teens and infants.

Unlikely since Norah will make them want to leave.", "They still aren't required to give anything to the newborn or say that she is their grandchild when she is not.", "That might be a fine explanation at an older age, but not for young children, and it is very likely to affect the family dynamics as Little Norah grows. We don't know how Norah's family treats the other kids, but if they get all of the kids gifts then the issue will be exacerbated and it's no longer \"they have 2 grandparents and you have 2 grandparents\". Any blended family situation is tough. This one has a lot of additional complexity that really needs the involvement of a family therapist.", "of course he is part of their family, his children are their grand children.  If OP's sister can't understand something that simple then she should never have married a widower.", "Yeah I think if there's no pushing or forcing of anything, kids tend to just say \"brother\" or \"sister.\" Technically my kids are half siblings (different dads) but it feels so strange to even type that, let alone say it. My daughter (10) would be LIVID if I called my son (1\u00bd) her half sibling. That's her BROTHER. Her stepdad has been in her life and living with us since she was 3; she knows him better than her own bio dad, who calls once a week and sees her on special occasions. The only reason she doesn't call my husband \"dad\" is because she's afraid it'll hurt her bio dad's feelings. But myself, my husband and both kids ARE the \"family.\" She doesn't see her stepdad or her brother as anything but her father and her brother, because I didn't push or force them to interact. I eased them into being close by respecting their feelings and going slow. Now she watches football and plays games with my husband and he and her have little games they play only with each other.

My sister is actually my half sister and my grandparents never treated her differently. They always included her in gift giving and everything. She wasn\u2019t excluded at family get togethers, even though there was no blood relation. \n\nIt\u2019s different of course since I never met my sister\u2019s grandparents, who would be more in line with this story. Also her dad is alive, he\u2019s just AH she has no contact with. \n\nI don\u2019t think they should have paid for the nursery though.", "Who has a kid over at Christmas and doesn't give them a gift? That's just cold blooded. The nursery is ridiculous, but not including the child in holiday celebrations is messed up. Poor little bean did no wrong.", "Correct. Where did I suggest they had to?", "That's a perfectly reasonable explanation for anyone old enough to even notice the discrepancy", "Yeah. I think the real problem here is that OP's sister interpreted \"one big happy family\" to mean more than it does.\n\nLike, my grandmother and her best friend from childhood lived within a few blocks of each other their entire life, and we always did holidays together and considered ourselves one big happy family. But there was also an understanding that within that large family unit, there were different levels of priorities. My grandmother always got me and my cousin several gifts and/or one large gift, whereas she only got her friend's grandkids one small gift each -- and vica versa (I only got one small thing from grandma's bestie). Same how my parents got me more than they got my cousin (and vica versa). It's easy enough to understand different levels of priority based on different familial relationships.\n\nNow, if the ILs try to exclude OP's child altogether or don't even get her any gifts ever, not even a small thing to make her feel included, that's another story. But imo it's fine for them to treat her as more distant family rather than as if she's their own grandchild.", "Maybe they will treat the baby more like a grandchild when it\u2019s older but it\u2019s 5 months old. Doesn\u2019t know its head from its ass. They are probably dealing with the fact that this baby is not their bio grandbaby, that their daughter will never have another child etc. They def did not need to supply the whole nursery for a child that wasn\u2019t their daughter\u2019s. Where are OPs parents in all this?

They can all belong and chances are In-laws will still do something small for OP's niece just not as extravagant", "But she's not their grandchild. She's the child of the woman who their late daughter's widower replaced her with. So this baby must stir up all kinds of grief for these people.", "Yeah I agree with this completely. You can't have it both ways. If they're family then she and her child should be treated like family. \n\n(I'm from a culture where polygamy is common, and this is absolutely the rule.
