Your director absolutely should have given more than 11 hours for people to be there, especially if she knew that graduation was happening. Her demand that you be there at exactly 9am after emailing the night before was absolutely unreasonable.", "NTA, she either should have sent the email much earlier or followed up with texts if it was truly a last minute necessity. She should be grateful you were only 15 minutes late after SHE dropped the ball like that!", "NTA. You should expect any email sent after like 3 pm on Friday will be ready by Monday. They needed a phone tree or some other mechanism if they want to call emergency rehearsals.", "NTA This woman YELLED at a child! And it was her own fault to not inform children about the rehearsal earlier. Is there someone above her whom you/your psrents can complain to? Some people shouldn't work with children...\n\nHave fun at your play! And congrats to your graduation!", "Oh honey no, you're NTA at all. You're young and you have other priorities over theatre. She can whine all she wants, but if she wanted to make sure everyone was there for extra rehearsal time, she should've sent texts or called people individually like the other parent had. Kudos to the other parent btw for taking extra measures where the director didn't.", "NTA. This can happen in the world of work too. Someone sends an email at 11pm demanding something before 9am. Work to live, not live to work", "Its the biggest problem when as the sender of an email, takes it as a given that everyone has read and acknowledged the correspondence once you hit send.\nDirector is in the wrong. If a read receipt is not requested which would then highlight to the director the actual compliance or lack there of for recievers having opened and suitably actioned. It would be interesting to know how many of those emails got opened at 8am the following morning.", "NTA\n\nI'm shocked someone could be that annoying 15 minutes is nothing, it's shocking you even made it tbh.", "NTA. Her lack of planning is not your fault. You all needed and deserved more than a 12 hour notice.", "NTA - telephone calls, text messages, pigeons may have worked better \ud83d\ude02", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We need to rehearse tomorrow.\" and hope people see it.", "NTA. Message sent is not message received.", "NTA. I mean, when other people are late too or maybe a no-show, it just shows that the fault lies on the director for the late notice.", "NTA, your Director clearly has no experience working with teenagers. I can\u2019t even think of a grown adult that would check their email at 11 o\u2019clock at night but to expect teenagers to do so? Ridiculous. More importantly, she should not have yelled at you like that for being 15 minutes late that is super bad form and unprofessional. You are definitely not in the wrong here.", "So in professional theatres it\u2019s sometimes reasonable to give 12 hours notice since you\u2019re kind of expected to be available to the show for the duration of the rehearsals and performances. \n\nHaving said that. You\u2019re a minor, it\u2019s community theatre and even in professional theatres they will often be lenient for special events in the cast\u2019s lives. But even if that weren\u2019t the case, she could have done this kindly. 9:15 is not the end of the world. \n\nNTA", ">especially if she knew that graduation was happening.\n\nI wonder if she did it because she knew of the graduation.\n\nLike those bitter teachers that like to schedule exams after spring break or long weekends even though they know most families have plans.", "I mean she gave 13 hours notice, but that still isn't enough.", "NTA", "Not if she knew that most teens/people/cast members would be graduating and were likely planning to go to a party a few days in advance of that.\n\n13 hours, especially if she sent the text around 8pm, definitely isn't enough time for everyone to suddenly reorganize or re-plan.", "I know, I was generally just being pedantic about the fact that the top comment messed up the basic math of 8pm to 9am.", "NTA. If a director wants to add an extra rehearsal they should first of all ask the cast if they are available. A rehearsal can't be called 12 hours beforehand without any previous signs there may be an impromptu rehearsal. If I were you I would  explain why that's not ok and I would make it known that I want an apology from the director."]}
