I also mentioned maybe putting a touch towards a down payment and trading in one of our vehicles (I gave her the option of taking my newer and more valuable vehicle, which I would of course transfer to her name, and trading in hers so she has more room but she doesn\u2019t like the thought of driving anything bigger than her little economy car) so I can buy something nicer and more reliable, or just chipping in for gas when we do ride together in the truck so I can save some money but she wasn\u2019t a fan of any of these, and again, I don\u2019t expect her to help with something that isn\u2019t really \u201chers\u201d so I didn\u2019t push the issue", "Agreed.

It seems a bit manipulative, but that's just from me reading your post with limited information. Can't say NTA/YTA. \n\nI'm just curious:\n\n1) How much did you ask for from her to help you buy a better truck? \n\n2) How much is the better truck and are you getting a loan or you wanted to do cash?\n\n3) What is the financial situation? Scraping by paycheck to paycheck or one more well off than the other?\n\n4) You own any other vehicles? What do you need the truck for specifically?

It's safe to assume $100 all in. Plus, you never know if they'll have one available when you need one.

It's one thing for her to not want to contribute to your vehicle given you're not married, but then to act like she and her friends are entitled to it and accuse you of punishing her by not making a poor financial decision indicates there are some serious issues with how your girlfriend views your relationship, you, and financial responsibility.\n\nNTA and I'd probably give this relationship a good think.", "Nta..but your gf and her friends seem to be..sounds like you and your truck were just an \"assumed convenience \"  for them..big red flag here..

Don't rush to get something that won't last.", "As long as your finances are separate, you are making choices to use your truck how you are using it. Unfortunately, if you are the friend w/ a truck, you are always asked to help out. It is just a thing that happens. I have been on both sides of the equation. I'm sure this isn't something you are doing for just your GF and her friends, but family, friends and others. If you don't want to be the guy that every acquaintance comes out of the woodwork to borrow a truck, then draw some boundaries. Everyone who has a truck (who doesn't live in an area where everyone has a truck) has to do this at some point b/c people don't understand how often these requests for truck-help come in.\n\nI also don't like long distance driving and make up for it on roadtrips by buying or making dinner/finding the hotel/paying for all the gas/buying all the road trip snacks or something similar to pay for the wear/tear and extra effort of the driver, depending on the situation.\n\nYou shouldn't have asked your GF to help pay for your truck, and you telling her the list of things in the future you can't do w/o a replacement truck could have very easily come off as sounding like punishment for not giving you money.\n\nYou are in a relationship. If you feel like you are being taken advantage of, then that is a discussion you need to have w/ your GF about roles and responsibilities and boundaries. However, when you are talking about things like driving to cabin w/ your truck b/c it is more convenient, then look at the relationship overall, are their things she does that make the relationship easier that you don't \"pay\" her for? Are the scales pretty evenly balanced? This shouldn't be a tit for tat review of your relationship, but you can tell if things are pretty evenly balanced. Make sure to pay attention to things around the house. For example, does she help you upkeep the house in ways that a renter wouldn't be responsible\n\nI honestly can't tell if you are overall being taken advantage of and this came out of frustration or if  you are discounting things your GF does for you, but either way, her giving you money for the truck should never have been part of the convo.", "Does she pay rent? That would help with the truck.", "You've merged accommodation but not transport? Are you a proper couple or not?

OP isn't wrong that right now is not a great time to take out a loan OR to get a good deal on a used truck. (Interest rates are high, and the used vehicle market is particularly hot right now.

Damn straight.

A truck works year round (though not great for gas mileage ).", "NTA.", "NTA but your girlfriend is on his latest reaction, thinking it's punishment. \nShe was in her right to refuse to loan you money. But she should accept that some decisions are out of your hands. \nDefinitely wait until you can buy something worthwhile you can afford", "NTA.  You need to sit down and explain to your gf why you needed her help initially and that need is still the same, but since she won't help, you'll have to save up for the down payment.  There is no bitterness, it's just a fact.  Maybe you weren't very clear initially?  Be clear now.", "NTA If she's not gonna help you with a new truck how can she expect you to take money out of your pocket that she knows you don't have to accommodate her and her friend who can still go in their own vehicles. Perhaps there are ways to make things more financially equal or if she doesn't wanna contribute then keep things separate. Not that I know the inner workings of your relationship or finances", "NTA. She is mad because you aren't going into bad debt which is inconveniencing her and her friends. Id be looking at her reaction to this very closely in regards to a future with her.", "NTA her friends shouldn't even be involved. When you get your truck do not help them.", "NTA.  You stated a fact that she didn't like and she's throwing a tantrum.   She sounds like a winner.", "NTA you asked, she declined to invest in a truck with you, so now she has to wait until you're able to afford one.", "NTA. Trucks are expensive these days\u2026 very\u2026 New ones can cost more than my first house ( early 80s). Used trucks that aren\u2019t a decade or more old, good shape, lower miles are often hard to find and when you do are way over priced due to demand. Tell gf to rent a uhaul truck when needed", "NTA, I kinda came from the same situation. I actually gave my bf some of my money to help towards a new truck. And we got a truck we both use. He uses it more and it\u2019s in his name. But I use it when I need it to help friends or I want a break from my car. She sounds a bit unhinged saying you\u2019re punishing her for it when that\u2019s something completely out of your control.", "NTA  - old vehicles dying is just what happens when time and rust comes for them. It was a secondary vehicle so natural it's not a priority to mend. It wasforseeable and because she benefited from its use, it was reasonable to ask for help for early replacement.\n\nBut now it is dead, then everyone is inconvencied until you can replace it at a time convenient to you financially and also logisitically as good old trucks can be rare as hen's teeth in some areas. But no one should tell you to take on the financial risk of a loan you might not be able to cover. You're the one with detailed knowledge of your finances and what liabilities you are comfortable with having. \n\nIt's not punishing your girlfriend - she had no stake in the truck except as it seems as an \"entitled\" user.  Yes,it was nice to use but she wasn't paying for that use nor is she paying for the new one. Fact the opportunity is no longer there is no-one's fault but age of vehicle. \n\nCould equally say she's been \"punishing\" you by volunteering you as \"a man with a van\" to all her friends. Hope you got beer and gas at least.", "This is very much a surprise Pikachu face kind of moment. As if not having a truck isn't hurting you, too. NTA", "NTA!  You are being wise by waiting until you can afford a truck.  They can deal until then, since it's not a punishment.  You are just being wise financially.", "NTA\n\nI find some of these comments and even your edit bizarre\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your money and your truck (or lack thereof), even if you did want to \u201cpunish\u201d her\u2026 that\u2019s your property and your right to do with it as you please\n\nIt\u2019s also v entitled of your gf to accuse you of punishing her when you literally can\u2019t do anything as you no longer have a truck. You literally just accommodated the changes r/t your truck dying and she\u2019s mad and takes it as \u201cpunishment\u201d \n\nHow childish she\u2019s being makes me laugh, thanks for that", "NTA\n\nI was raised with the life lesson of \"you reap what you sow\". Natural consequences!\n\nOP, I hope you get a very fine truck when you feel financially comfortable.", "NTA. Goint into debt when it\u2019s not absolutely necessary would be a bad decision.  Wait until you have saved to buy one. If she doesn\u2019t want to contribute (and she shouldn\u2019t have to) then she can\u2019t be upset with you for not being able to afford one right now.", "NTA, but I have to question if this story is real. A truck owner who actually hauls things and uses the bed?!  That alone would be worth the down payment to see.", "NTA.", "NTA, but does your GF even like you? As in, does she like you personally, or just splitting rent and having someone do stuff for her?\n\nI had a partner whose motto was very much \"what's yours is mine, but what's mine is mine\". Also, he would put everything on credit cards with no plan on when/how to pay things back. \n\nIt's not really about the truck, it's about quite a bit of entitlement from your GF. and laybe a different view on how to spend, save etc. That can become a big problem overtime. \n\nAnd what is it with my gender dragging their friends into every couple disagreement to score points? It's not high school anymore. Sigh...", "NAH, but if one chooses to find the most asshole present, then mildly you are an ass for asking your long term relationship to help you get a new truck instead of an engagement ring or a downpayment for a home for you both to share.\n\nread between the lines, OP. if you are being punished, it's probably not for your old truck or a new truck, but for the things you put ahead of your relationship.", "NTA if they want a truck to haul them and their shit, *they* can also get a loaner/rental/lease.", "NTA\n\nIts not like you killed your truck on purpose just to inconvenience her. Why should you take out a loan just because her and her friends think you should? That\u2019s rude. I think your being perfectly sensible in your approach to getting a new truck. It\u2019s not a necessity right now as you have a vehicle so it makes sense to save for it and avoid loan charges.", "You not being able to afford a new truck and being financially savvy isn't a punishment and it's really weird she went there. Nta", "NTA bro. She wasn't down to help she has no say and how you should get a truck. You take your time and avoid a loan if possible my guy we in a financial crisis and those interests rates are crippling.", "Yeah you should know its usually not your girlfriend you usually ask your wife", "op=NTA\n\nno reason you should ever get loans/acquire debt just for someone else's convenience. \n\nShe doesn't want the \"inconvenience\" of two vehicles to cabin or lack of loan to her friends.  You(both) could rent a vehicle for cabin trips for the dogs etc, The friends can find another friend or RENT a vehicle.  You and yours aren't there just for their needs.\n\nAnd it is typical that \"her\" friends only see her side(mainly because that's what they are hearing), so ignore them.", "NTA. Nope, you're making a smart financial decision.  How does it punish your GF that you want to save up for a high quality truck?  If this is typical and she blames you for hurting her a bunch when you're just going about your life in a rational way, maybe you need to find someone else to drive shotgun with you in the new truck.  \n\nP.S.  Stop asking your GF to help you buy things you can't afford.  It sounds a bit exploitive and it probably feels that way to her to, even if you're perfectly nice when she declines.  If you do this a bunch, it would be a deal breaker for a lot of sensible women.", "YTA", "NAH\n\nWhether or not you're \"punishing\" her is irrelevant to you using this to organize your funds.  She didn't want to help you organize your funds, so now you have to do it yourself.  Sucks for her.  But I can see why she'd think that", ">I simply don\u2019t have the money for a quality truck saved up right now\n\nThis is what we call a \"you problem\"", "If she loans (read GIVES) you money are tou putting her name in the truck title?\n\nNo? Get a loan & pay for your own damn truck\n\nYTA", "Just my thoughts.  Worth what you pay for them.  I would call you an a-hole for asking her.  If you were married, it would be a joint decision and asset and then acceptable.  I don't view backing out of helping others as punishment.  The engine died.  It can't be driven.  Getting a newer 'used' truck isn't cheap.  I know everyone thinks just get a loan, but if your finances don't allow a payment, then it's not feasible.  Besides, getting a loan for a vehicle that is a 'nice to have' and not a 'need to have' is bad fiscal management.\n\nSo judgement time. \n\nESH\n\nBased on you asking for help when not married.  Her for assuming you are punishing her for not helping when it's clear the truck is dead and that's life, it happens.  Not everyone can just go out and make an expensive purchase.  Nationwide average used vehicle pricing is dropping.  But some vehicles are still expensive like trucks.", "She said no to loaning you money, which is fine.\n\nIf you can't afford a truck, you can't afford a truck, not sure what she wants you to do here other than wait since you don't want to take out a loan, which is reasonable. If you get a loan and a truck immediately after the trip you probably deserve getting blamed for doing this on purpose.\n\nYou are NTA at all.\n\n(You're kind of a jerk because of the clickbait title.)", "This situation is tricky. You are NTA for not purchasing a new truck if it doesn't make financial sense. However, and completely imo, asking your girlfriend to help with a big purchase like a truck may not be the wisest. What happens if you break up? Would her name be on the title? Too many unknowns.", "Unfortunately, I think the used truck market is going to be pricey for quite some time.  Glad I bought my truck 2 years ago when prices were getting high, but I still got a super low interest rate.", "Not to mention, \u2018she hates driving long distances\u2019, \u2018 She hates driving large vehicles, even my crossover is too much for her\u2019\u2026\u2026\n\nshe gets him to do all the things with a truck she does not like doing, PLUS move her friends and whatever else a person with a truck gets volunteered for.  I think he should charge hourly rental fees plus mileage plus fuel when she wants him to do stuff for her or friends with his truck.\n\nbut I am petty like that when someone wants, wants, wants, and does not see that they have the responsibility for the cost of what they want.  She does not have to put money in for the truck, I think that would just cause issues later on, but she does need to compensate for constantly using it through him, though.  As it is, she gets all the benefit of having a truck, without any of the costs associated with having a truck.", "Whenever you do get a truck, get compensation for using it and stick that in your truck upkeep/replacement fund.\n\nAnd yes, even if people bitch about it, wait to buy it until it is a financially wise decision.\n\nGas money, small fee, whatever you want to call it.  Don\u2019t let them think they\u2019re automatically entitled to the use of your truck.\n\nI\u2019ve been very grateful three times for friends with trucks who were willing to help me move.

You're asking for her buy in on something that's for you to make a daily driver cuz you're going to give her your beat up car?!", "No, he asked if she would be willing to help him with the payment.
