If you don't have the means anymore to help with these chores, you can say that as the situations arise.\n\nGood used trucks are notoriously difficult to find -- people tend to drive them into the ground.

I also mentioned maybe putting a touch towards a down payment and trading in one of our vehicles (I gave her the option of taking my newer and more valuable vehicle, which I would of course transfer to her name, and trading in hers so she has more room but she doesn\u2019t like the thought of driving anything bigger than her little economy car) so I can buy something nicer and more reliable, or just chipping in for gas when we do ride together in the truck so I can save some money but she wasn\u2019t a fan of any of these, and again, I don\u2019t expect her to help with something that isn\u2019t really \u201chers\u201d so I didn\u2019t push the issue", "Agreed.

It seems a bit manipulative, but that's just from me reading your post with limited information. Can't say NTA/YTA. \n\nI'm just curious:\n\n1) How much did you ask for from her to help you buy a better truck? \n\n2) How much is the better truck and are you getting a loan or you wanted to do cash?\n\n3) What is the financial situation? Scraping by paycheck to paycheck or one more well off than the other?\n\n4) You own any other vehicles? What do you need the truck for specifically?

It's safe to assume $100 all in. Plus, you never know if they'll have one available when you need one.

It's one thing for her to not want to contribute to your vehicle given you're not married, but then to act like she and her friends are entitled to it and accuse you of punishing her by not making a poor financial decision indicates there are some serious issues with how your girlfriend views your relationship, you, and financial responsibility.\n\nNTA and I'd probably give this relationship a good think.", "Nta..but your gf and her friends seem to be..sounds like you and your truck were just an \"assumed convenience \"  for them..big red flag here..

You are accustomed to having a truck handy but it wasn't your primary vehicle.  Don't rush to get something that won't last.", "As long as your finances are separate, you are making choices to use your truck how you are using it. Unfortunately, if you are the friend w/ a truck, you are always asked to help out. It is just a thing that happens. I have been on both sides of the equation. I'm sure this isn't something you are doing for just your GF and her friends, but family, friends and others. If you don't want to be the guy that every acquaintance comes out of the woodwork to borrow a truck, then draw some boundaries. Everyone who has a truck (who doesn't live in an area where everyone has a truck) has to do this at some point b/c people don't understand how often these requests for truck-help come in.\n\nI also don't like long distance driving and make up for it on roadtrips by buying or making dinner/finding the hotel/paying for all the gas/buying all the road trip snacks or something similar to pay for the wear/tear and extra effort of the driver, depending on the situation.\n\nYou shouldn't have asked your GF to help pay for your truck, and you telling her the list of things in the future you can't do w/o a replacement truck could have very easily come off as sounding like punishment for not giving you money.\n\nYou are in a relationship. If you feel like you are being taken advantage of, then that is a discussion you need to have w/ your GF about roles and responsibilities and boundaries. However, when you are talking about things like driving to cabin w/ your truck b/c it is more convenient, then look at the relationship overall, are their things she does that make the relationship easier that you don't \"pay\" her for? Are the scales pretty evenly balanced? This shouldn't be a tit for tat review of your relationship, but you can tell if things are pretty evenly balanced. Make sure to pay attention to things around the house. For example, does she help you upkeep the house in ways that a renter wouldn't be responsible\n\nI honestly can't tell if you are overall being taken advantage of and this came out of frustration or if  you are discounting things your GF does for you, but either way, her giving you money for the truck should never have been part of the convo.", "Does she pay rent? That would help with the truck.", "You've merged accommodation but not transport? Are you a proper couple or not?

OP isn't wrong that right now is not a great time to take out a loan OR to get a good deal on a used truck. (Interest rates are high, and the used vehicle market is particularly hot right now.

Damn straight.  But to expect you to be a short haul mover and not admit it is to her benefit, too, for you to have a running truck, is pretty short-sighted of her.\n\njust don\u2019t make your next truck available to any one, other than yourself.", " NTA.
