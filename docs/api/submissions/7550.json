I can\u2019t really blame either of you in that context, though hopefully she reaches that point of acceptance as you seem to have.\n\nEven beaters are expensive now with the way that the used truck market has inflated as of late.

Why go down that path?   If you don't have the means anymore to help with these chores, you can say that as the situations arise.\n\nGood used trucks are notoriously difficult to find -- people tend to drive them into the ground.   You've been lucky that you had beater you could use and now you don't have one, it's just that simple.    Keep saving and be on the lookout for a good value used truck.", "NTA.

Ofc if i use my partnes service of driving me and my friends i would pay for gas occasionally.

I also mentioned maybe putting a touch towards a down payment and trading in one of our vehicles (I gave her the option of taking my newer and more valuable vehicle, which I would of course transfer to her name, and trading in hers so she has more room but she doesn\u2019t like the thought of driving anything bigger than her little economy car) so I can buy something nicer and more reliable, or just chipping in for gas when we do ride together in the truck so I can save some money but she wasn\u2019t a fan of any of these, and again, I don\u2019t expect her to help with something that isn\u2019t really \u201chers\u201d so I didn\u2019t push the issue", "Agreed. It seems that OP may be about to lose some dead weight.

I don't think you necessarily need your truck to help move things. IF they are large items, why can't they just rent a moving truck from home depot for $20/hour?\n\nIt's just oddly specific the way you mention the need/uses for the truck and those exact need/uses are the ones you back out of or make it hard for her later on. It seems a bit manipulative, but that's just from me reading your post with limited information. Can't say NTA/YTA. \n\nI'm just curious:\n\n1) How much did you ask for from her to help you buy a better truck? \n\n2) How much is the better truck and are you getting a loan or you wanted to do cash?\n\n3) What is the financial situation? Scraping by paycheck to paycheck or one more well off than the other?\n\n4) You own any other vehicles? What do you need the truck for specifically?

Maybe have it a little more \"legal\" with signed papers and such?  I know I would not want to be down for that kind of money without some good paperwork.\n\nIs selling or renting out the cabin an option for the down payment?", "Because renting a truck is expensive - there's the initial rental cost, the hourly rental charge and the gas cost for a very low MPG vehicle. It's safe to assume $100 all in. Plus, you never know if they'll have one available when you need one. So if she knows she'll be needing a truck multiple times throughout the year, it makes sense to give him a few hundred, because she financially comes out ahead.", "She lives in *his* house and her/her friends regularly use *his* facilities for their benefit and now they\u2019re going to struggle to visit *his* summer cabin but it came across that *he* was like a gold digger?

While yes, its her choice to not want to help financially, she doesn\u2019t have the right to complain and accuse you of trying to \u201cpunish her\u201d (which is totally ridiculous). \n\nTruth be told, she doesn\u2019t sound like the best of partners if this is how she acts when life happens and something doesn\u2019t go her way. And to get her friends involved is just plain old immature.", "I was on the fence on this, but I finally went with NTA\n\nI'm kind of funky on you asking your GF for money for YOIUR  truck. sure, she get the benefit from it, but if you were to break up with her tomorrow, you still have a truck and her money.\n\nThe fact you were cool with her saying no, pushed me to NTA.

You suck for asking your _girlfriend_ for financial help with a large purchase - especially a depreciating asset she doesn't really reap that much benefit from (you clearly have alternatives i.e. taking two cars), she sucks for assuming you not getting a new one right away is punishment for her not being willing or able to financially contribute. It's a logical assumption to make although a shitty one.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBeing unwilling to get a loan to make somebody else's life easier is not punishment.

Honestly your girlfriend and her friends should mind their own business rather than telling you to get a loan.", "Do you often feel like your girlfriend is taking advantage of you? It's one thing for her to not want to contribute to your vehicle given you're not married, but then to act like she and her friends are entitled to it and accuse you of punishing her by not making a poor financial decision indicates there are some serious issues with how your girlfriend views your relationship, you, and financial responsibility.\n\nNTA and I'd probably give this relationship a good think.", "Nta..but your gf and her friends seem to be..sounds like you and your truck were just an \"assumed convenience \"  for them..big red flag here.. I would be reviewing my relationship..", "NTA", " \nRather, there is one that will not require nursing to keep on the road.", "Or RENT one. When we got tired of our old truck nickel and diming us to death, we donated it to charity. We briefly considered a new one, but it seemed ridiculous for 2 people to insure and maintain 3 vehicles.

If that's not enough for a weekend at their cabin, they're taking too much stuff!\n\nEdited to add: OP, what about a roof rack or small trailer for your weekend getaways?", "TBH, it sounds like replacement truck is a want rather than a need.   You are accustomed to having a truck handy but it wasn't your primary vehicle.  Don't rush to get something that won't last.", "As long as your finances are separate, you are making choices to use your truck how you are using it. Unfortunately, if you are the friend w/ a truck, you are always asked to help out. It is just a thing that happens. I have been on both sides of the equation. I'm sure this isn't something you are doing for just your GF and her friends, but family, friends and others. If you don't want to be the guy that every acquaintance comes out of the woodwork to borrow a truck, then draw some boundaries. Everyone who has a truck (who doesn't live in an area where everyone has a truck) has to do this at some point b/c people don't understand how often these requests for truck-help come in.\n\nI also don't like long distance driving and make up for it on roadtrips by buying or making dinner/finding the hotel/paying for all the gas/buying all the road trip snacks or something similar to pay for the wear/tear and extra effort of the driver, depending on the situation.\n\nYou shouldn't have asked your GF to help pay for your truck, and you telling her the list of things in the future you can't do w/o a replacement truck could have very easily come off as sounding like punishment for not giving you money.\n\nYou are in a relationship. If you feel like you are being taken advantage of, then that is a discussion you need to have w/ your GF about roles and responsibilities and boundaries. However, when you are talking about things like driving to cabin w/ your truck b/c it is more convenient, then look at the relationship overall, are their things she does that make the relationship easier that you don't \"pay\" her for? Are the scales pretty evenly balanced? This shouldn't be a tit for tat review of your relationship, but you can tell if things are pretty evenly balanced. Make sure to pay attention to things around the house. For example, does she help you upkeep the house in ways that a renter wouldn't be responsible\n\nI honestly can't tell if you are overall being taken advantage of and this came out of frustration or if  you are discounting things your GF does for you, but either way, her giving you money for the truck should never have been part of the convo.", "Does she pay rent? That would help with the truck.", "You've merged accommodation but not transport? Are you a proper couple or not? It sounds like she's not fully committed.\n\n/edit: and she won't even help with fuel costs for long journeys? Wow. You have bigger problems. I'd have no truck with her attitude.", "Why should she and her friends use HIS truck? If they use it then its their truck not his. They are not married and being a gf and her friends isn\u2019t that important", "He does clarify that they are living together, and he considers this a long-term relationship.  It's more serious than just \"we're dating\".\n\nThat still doesn't mean that she has to feel comfortable entering into a financial obligation with him like this.\n\nBut that also doesn't mean she gets to call him an asshole for making his own financial decisions, like holding off on buying another new truck until he can find more favorable conditions.\n\nHer (and her friends) suggesting that he take out a loan for what is essentially HER (and their) convenience just shows how ready people can be to spend other people's money.  OP isn't wrong that right now is not a great time to take out a loan OR to get a good deal on a used truck. (Interest rates are high, and the used vehicle market is particularly hot right now.  Both will hopefully cool off over time, but it's hard to say exactly when that will happen.)", "> Why should she pay for HIS truck?\n\nshe's getting use out of it so she should contribute.", "She shouldn't, but he should then charge her a rental fee for any use of the truck for her friends or to go to the cabin.

No free rides.", "Is he really a \"random boyfriend\" when they've been living together in his house for several years?\n\nAt any rate, she ISN'T obligated to chip in on the truck with him.  But at the same time, then, if she doesn't feel that strongly tied to him -- why should HE make unwise financial decisions just to benefit her and her friends?", "She's not but she is pushing him to get a loan he doesn't want.", ">So do as your girlfriend and other friends do, get by with one vehicle until you have enough to afford a decent truck -- either another beater or better, loan worthy truck.\n\nI mean, it sounds like that IS what he wants to do.

Romantic partners should be a factor in making a major life decision, especially when you live together.", "Not really, he is more focused on replacing the truck than waiting to get a better truck.", "Though it sounds in this case like OP tried to get her invested in the coming decision, seeing the end of the current truck in the future, and she declined, but is upset and involving her friends after the fact that she has lost the benefit.", "Not until finances are shared.", "Unless they are sharing finances, buying a vehicle is not a major life decision.", "Wait a minute, \u201cchipping in for gas\u201d when you\u2019re helping her friends was a no?
