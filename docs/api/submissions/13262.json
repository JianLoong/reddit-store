At first we were hesitant on her moving to another state since out of state tuition can be costly, but we decided that if this was something that she really wants to do, then we'll support her.\n\nShe being 19 and having no money, we set some conditions for her just to help her out:\n1. For the first 2 semester, we will pay her tuition and housing.\n2. During those first 2 semester, she must find a job and start saving up to start paying for her own housing/tuition\n3. She has to show us her grades at the end of each semester, and as long as she's passing and attending college we would help her pay half of her tuition cost.\n\nFast forward to now, we found out from our son when he went to give her a surprised visit that she was no longer living at the address. In short, we found out from the school that she hasn't been attending college since Dec 2021 and that she's been sending us fake grade reports so that she could keep on receiving money from us. She's also been spending that money on going to parties, buying a BMW, and living an lavish lifestyle.\n\nAfter finding this out, we called and confronter her about what we've learned. We essentially told her that she can do whatever she wanted and we're not going to force her to pay back the money, but we would not be sending her any more money so that she could spend it by going to parties etc.\n\nShe got really angry at us and said that we don't love her, we only cared about her other brother and sister, how's she going to pay for her car, and how not sending her money will ruin her financially. \n\nEven after the outburst we were firm on our decision and reminded her that she's an adult now and her actions have consequences. We reminded her on the conditions we set if she wanted to receive money from us.\n\nToday I received messages from some of our relatives and people we've never met on social media that we're being too strict on her and that we're family and we need to help each other. I understand that family needs to help one another but I also don't want my daughter think that we're going to be funding a lavish lifestyle (that she clearly cannot sustain independently) for a long time. \n\nWe ended up calling her again and suggest she should move back in with us so that she only has her car loan to worry about instead of w/e she's dealing with now. Even after giving her our suggestion, she told us she rather us send her money instead.\n\nAfter receiving all those messages, I dunno if we're being too strict on her or not.", "created_utc": 1679862902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122yogn/aita_for_not_helping_my_daughter_by_sending_her/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is a line between help and indefinitely funding her wannabe starlet dreams. She could move back home, she could adjust her lifestyle to fit her means, of course she would rather you just keep sending her money. Heck, why not send more money? She would probably prefer that even more. And 22 years old is too old to be whining you only love her if you pay for her to have nice things. Unless you\u2019re paying for her siblings to be driving around a BMW her whining is ridiculous. And driving a BMW has nothing to do with her acting ambitions. Does she think she think the other aspiring actors drive BMWs?
