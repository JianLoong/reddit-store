He was completely aware I was enlisting and we got married so he could live with me out of the country. Military\u2019s rules not mine. \n\nWe moved in together overseas, but so did his mom. She did not live in our household but ran it as if she did, down to the meals I was cooking. Our arguments escalated because he would call her and get the entire family involved and it was a huge mess. He didn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t cook, didn\u2019t clean. All he did was play video games, go to the gym, and \u201cattend classes\u201d. \n\nIm the bread winner and housewife all in one. This way, I feel I have every right to decompress with a glass of wine and a book right? According to him I am not allowed to touch alcohol as long as we live together because his mom is an alcoholic. I will not agree to this and I will not let him dictate what I do in my decompression time, especially when I do his laundry and still wake up to go to work every morning while he sleeps or is still up from the previous night playing games. This has been the bulk of our arguments on top of many other things. \n\nConstantly we\u2019ve been arguing and he\u2019s gone back and forth to the states on MY dime for the past few months and I\u2019m getting tired of it. He didn\u2019t even spend thanksgiving, Christmas, or new years with me. I spent the holidays alone. We\u2019ve discussed divorce but he won\u2019t agree, he feels he cant love anyone else blah blah all that stuff. Mentally I\u2019ve checked out, I\u2019m over living with a roommate and I\u2019ve fallen out of love, I have been for a while now. I\u2019ve given him so many chances to change and even remove his mom from our relationship but he hasn\u2019t done either. \n\nHe wants to come back to living with me because his parents are kicking him out, this is not confirmed but our dads are friends and there\u2019s been word. He\u2019s expressed wanting to come back over the holidays but \u201ccouldn\u2019t make up his mind\u201d. I told him If he comes back it\u2019s completely on my terms, he needs to focus on making me happy and contributing to the home and he\u2019s diverted the conversation every time. \n\nI don\u2019t want him to come back but I\u2019m delaying the answer, he says it\u2019s not fair to him because I won\u2019t give him an immediate answer and he wants to start the new year fresh. I don\u2019t believe it for a second, he wanted to spend the holidays and mooch off of his family as much as he could before getting an answer back to me on if he wants to come back. \n\nI really want a divorce and I\u2019m planning on following through, I want to move on. Therapy and one on one conversations haven\u2019t worked and i\u2019m done fighting for us just to be back in a toxic environment and used. This may mean he will be homeless due to his own selfishness as he\u2019s a couch potato at his parents place as well. I feel guilty because I could prevent it but I don\u2019t want to live through misery. \n\nAITA for following through even though this means he might be homeless?\n\nETA: My mistake on wording. His mom does not live with us, he just constantly called her every day to help with being \u201cthe man of the house\u201d \nHis dad has expressed to myself and my dad that he\u2019s tired of Austin and his mother and they way they act. His mother is a major mooch as well.
