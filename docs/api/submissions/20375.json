That seems ..\n Extreme", ">My BFF is a relaxed parent, allowing her daughter to learn through free play which includes but is not limited to, drawing on the walls, pouring food on the floor and eating mainly crisps\n\nSo, really, she isn't doing any parenting whatsoever.

It\u2019s pretty normal for parents to have to decline wedding invitations in order to take care of their kids. She didn\u2019t ask you to cancel the wedding, if you can\u2019t do it without her that\u2019s on you.", "I mean your son will always encounter kids who are allowed more or less than him.

(If daughter is really 6-yo, how is doing at school? Or is she home/un-schooled?) All kids need boundaries, which includes being told \"NO\" sometimes. \n\nAs for you, if this has been going on for so long, you would have done better to address your parenting differences earlier on, in a calm moment or two.

Im curious as to how a free range child who might destroy a table of sweets or sound equipment at a wedding would be able to fall in line without issue at school.  If she's six she's prob been thru kindergarten and 1st grade.", "Right?!  So you cancelled because a friend and her daughter declined? What about your family? What about your fianc\u00e9? If you canceled just because she couldn\u2019t attend then who were you really having that wedding for?", "Exactly.\n\nThis 6 year old and her bratty behavior should not hold your family hostage.", "I don't know why OP thinks E is going to change in a year, or two, versus 6 months, when nothing is being done to change her behavior. There's absolutely zero indication that the friend is going to change how she parents. \n\nI feel for E, because her mom is setting her up for a difficult life at this rate. Is E expected to figure out how she's supposed to act at a friend's house on her own, or will she remain destructive? If nothing changes, her ability to socially connect with her peers is going to suffer, because they're not going to like her when she breaks their things. She'll be treated like an outsider, which only sets her up for further failure.\n\nE deserves better, but no one wants to risk hurting her mom's feelings. It's easier to watch it all spiral out of control.", "It was a small wedding and she would have been the only one at my side as maid of honour so it felt wrong doing it without her there, I was trying to make it possible for her to go, but when she said she would be too stressed, it didn't feel right doing it without her", "Can I possibly tell her to step up without losing a friend? Because that's really what I want to do but I can see that making me a bigger AH", "I agree, cancelling the wedding is on me, but this just highlights how hard it is to plan a day out with the kids, how can we go to the fair if she can't be trusted not to break things and set a bad example? I thought with 6 months till the wedding she would try and compromise and teach her daughter how to behave in that setting for 1 day (it wasn't a formal event i and planned, it was all outside)", "I omitted some details, the wedding was a last minute thing due to a health scare with my grandad, who is fine now and it has been postponed to next year with the hopes that everything will run smoother then, it wasn't cancelled exclusively because of my friend and her daughter\n\nI understand its sucky to comment on someone else's parenting and have been treading lightly on the subject but I do feel that without any changes its going to make life stressful and difficult for everyone involved and as her best friend I feel I should offer as much help and support as I can, even if sometimes that sounds harsh (eg, telling her she needs to learn the meaning of the word no)", "My fellas not arsed about a piece of paper, the wedding was an excuse for me to dress up and have a family party but tah for the judgment \ud83d\ude02", "She is doing well at school, her spelling is amazing and the teachers sing her praises, we also go to speech therapy together where she sits and interacts with us all for an hour so she is capable of focusing and learning just fine, it's a lack of willingness to inform this time at home from my friend that prevents these boundaries from transferring in to her home life\nIts something we've touched on, but I definitely snapped more than I should have this time, obviously the lack of effort for my wedding upset me and I am prone to over reacting! I offer advice on bedtime routines and meal plans and get shot down with \"that won't work for her\" and \"you don't understand you don't have a 6year old\" which tbh, she's not my kid and I don't push much further cos its not my place", "I was having the wedding for us, she's a close friend of my fianc\u00e9 and considered a second daughter to my parents, I don't think any of us would enjoy the day without her there\nWe're having a garden party on the same day instead and all the same people are invited and it'll cost them less, they're probably happier I cancelled tbh", "It doesn\u2019t matter. You either embrace that this little girl is like this and know that your wedding is going to be manic, or you go ahead without them.\n\nThis person has way too much control over your life and I think it\u2019s so unhealthy.", "You can gently bring this up to her and ask if she\u2019s happy with that or if she\u2019d like to change the situation. A true friendship can withstand some tough love. \n\nAlso don\u2019t blame her for your decision to cancel your wedding. That\u2019s unfair. (Sorry if I read that wrong)", "Sometimes you need to use tough love.  Tell her straight.  Make sure she knows you're saying it out of love but tell her straight", "NTA. I can see you were in a tough spot but the reality is that the friendship is going to have to change. Either you both agree to only meet without the kids being around (which seems impractical) or there are going to be serious clashes when her kid runs wild and you are trying to be a responsible parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Might be best to start distancing yourself from this friend and making new friendships because things are going to get much worse. I shudder to think what kind of teenager 'E' is going. You really want to stay as far away from that car crash as possible.", "But then she'd have the same right to criticize your parenting and to tell you that your son should have way fewer restrictions, otherwise her daughter feels bad.\n\nI think it's a good opportunity for your son to learn that everyone's different.\n\nI think that mostly you're totally annoyed by her unruly daughter, and that's really understandable. But then it's up to you to for example not have her daughter over that much.", "You know you don't have to get married just to have a party, right?\n\nBut maybe it's your BFF that you should be marrying because it's obviously her that matters more.", "INFO Are any of those people traveling/flying? Did they take off work? Are you expecting them to do so again in a years time? Why do you think the 6 year olds behavior is going to drastically change, without her mom making drastic changes?", "Too much control over OP and apparently no control over her own daughter \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm going to brain storm some ways to approach a very tough conversation with her! \nThere were other factors that contributed to me cancelling the wedding, I don't think I have made her feel responsible as I have said I understand her decision not to come and wouldn't want her stressing that her daughter was destroying my center peices or whatever, it would be lovely to have them there, but at this stage impossible and although it hurts I do understand that", "It seems to me there has to be a change in her parenting style and her daughters behaviour, or im going to have to distance myself for my sons sake, it breaks my heart, we've been best friends for 15 years but this is making things difficult", "Having a party instead, thanks"]}
