My wife (44F) and I have been planning their parties with them for the past few months.\n\nOn Saturday, it was Milan, my SIL\u2019s son\u2019s (nephew) birthday party, he turned 13 around a week and a half prior. Milan is a good boy and absolutely loves working with kids, which has recently led him to babysitting and trying to get involved in coaching and refereeing younger kids sports. Milan has talked about wanting a large family and wanting to help kids, all of that good stuff.\n\nMilan is also very quick to pick up on things, smart kid, and he\u2019s on a travel baseball team. Some of the areas that my SIL and her husband have passed through wile diving Milan have been pretty poor and Milan has asked his parents and others about this and looked it up on TikTok. The area we live in is very wealthy and Milan was confused at what we saw, I\u2019ve even driven Milan to a few games as I have a flexible work from home schedule while my SIL and her husband often have corporate meetings they can\u2019t miss.\n\nMilan has asked me a few of these questions about different areas to, sometimes things as simple as why the buildings look \u201cso strange\u201d. Apparently through TikTok, Milan has learned about some sports charities that help kids in poorer areas and stuff like sports for disabled people charities. At his birthday party, Milan had a place where people could donate, either physically or an online link to a few of these charities. As I\u2019ve mentioned the area is affluent so a lot of people wouldn\u2019t mind giving some money. Milan still got plenty of gifts and cards.\n\nIn the car ride home, my wife and I heard Pam and Abby giggling in the back, so we decided to ask them what they were looking at (we thought it\u2019d just be some TikTok or meme), they were laughing at the charity stuff set up at Milan\u2019s birthday saying that it showed how Milan is just one of the \u201ccringe\u201d members of Gen Z and saying he should stop worrying about other people\u2019s lives and just focus on his own. They said he\u2019s too sensitive and that the charity stuff \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t do any good\u201d. When we told them to stop we were just told to calm down. \n\nWhen we got home, my wife and I went in our room to discuss what they were saying. We agreed that there should be some sort of punishment for it, we agreed that their allowance should go to the charities Milan was trying to support and told them instead of getting their normal allowance they\u2019d have to do chores to earn some and said until they\u2019ve each raised $300 that they can\u2019t have their birthday party (it\u2019s separate parties) and we made sure they can reach that by July.\n\nOur daughters are furious at us and have been sending messages on Instagram to their cousins (including Milan) complaining about us so now we\u2019re hearing from family about it.

Aren't you concerned it will just breed more resentment to those less fortunate?", "YTA. By your own admission, you\u2019re from a wealthy area and had not ever exposed your other kids to other socioeconomic classes until recently. In other words, your rich people who have exposed your rich lifestyles and that\u2019s it. And now you\u2019re somehow surprised when your rich, spoiled children express a rich, spoiled viewpoint. When they do that, the answer isn\u2019t to punish them. The answer is to educate them. Go ahead and have them donate money to charities as part of a whole family plan to do so (you and your wife donate, right?). Have them volunteer at homeless shelters. But taking away their party that you already planned them is just mean and will not help inspire empathy in them.", "YTA; I think maybe the reason they are so uncharitable might be because you think you can \u2018punish\u2019 them into caring about others. Charity is not a punishment, it\u2019s a great thing that should be a reward and rewarding. \n\nObviously if helping others is something you do as a punishment, they\u2019d think it ridiculous. Instead of punishing you should set up a reward for them to do it if their own will.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that your nephew thought poor areas of town looked \"so strange\" and was \"confused\" at the age of 13 about discovering that some people live in poverty indicates that your entire family has raised very sheltered, spoiled children. That's on you as parents for failing to set a good example.\n\nRather than overcorrecting by taking their birthday parties, I would suggest the entire family start volunteering at homeless shelters on the weekends. I would suggest mom and dad start donating their money and time and leading by example. Children learn from the example their parents set. If you have raised spoiled children who think poverty is a joke... there's a reason and taking away a birthday party isn't going to fix it.", "Here's the thing: Your daughters did not BEHAVE in a bad manner. (When I started reading, I thought you were going to say they stole the charity money. They didn't do that)\n\nYou are punishing them for their thoughts instead of teaching them WHY you disagree with their beliefs. \n\nThat makes YTA!", "YTA. \n\nYou have failed up until now to instill compassion within your children, so they're just highlighting your flaws. \n\nAs for them complaining to their cousins, that's normal teenage (and adult) behavior. \n\nBirthdays should never be leveraged into a punishment. Take away phones/devices, punish them from activities/friends, but don't withhold the celebration of their births as a form of punishment.", "INFO: so what exactly have you yourself or your personal family done for charities", "YTA.\n\nIf your children had grown up seeing you and your wife donate to or work with a charity, they would know the value of it.  But you did not model that behavior.  You also could have encouraged them to participate in an organization that gives back like Scouting, Key Club, etc.  But you did not do that.\n\nNow you are taking a couple of minutes of in the car and using it to completely change the rules of your household: they no longer get to keep their allowance, they have to work for an allowance that they were previously entitled to, and they are possibly losing their birthday party.  That is a ridiculous amount to lose for what amounts to a couple of minutes of anti-charity ranting.  \n\nYou could have used this incident to talk to your children about inequality and how to know if a charity is effective.  \n\nInstead, you are giving an incredibly over the top punishment without reflecting on *why* your children act that way.  Hint: It begins at home.", "After careful consideration, YTA. And maybe look at the background of this, you live in a wealthy area, and for the past decade and a half you could've taught your kids basic empathy. The answer to why they act that way begins at home. And it begins with educating them about socioeconomic situations many people can't get out of because this system keeps people poor. Punishing them for how you raised them doesn't teach them anything except how to be angry at their parents for not following their expectations. So educate them now or they start voting for MAGATs later.", "NTA. A lot of these judgments are based on your failings as parents to expose your kids to other social classes, which they're right about. And making the girls do chores probably isn't going to help much either.\n\nBut I don't think you're an AH for trying to instill empathy in your children, you just have a lot of extra work to do because apparently you started late.", "So you want to punish them because you failed to raise them right?\n\nYeah YTA", "YTA. You can\u2019t punish someone to make them care about others.  And all they might learn from this is that if you throw some money at problems then you\u2019ve done your part and can move on.  And punishing them for not having the values they evidently didn\u2019t learn from you, is an easy out for you.\n\nFind a cause that is meaningful to your daughters and all of you volunteer your time. Donate money too, but the only way you can learn about others needs is by volunteering to help.  Choose to volunteer a few hours a month to a soup kitchen, a food or clothing bank, the humane society, a local Head Start or after school program, Habitat for Humanity. Something you can do as a family.  Teach them by example.  Not by punishment.", "NTA  It might be beneficial to not only donate but for them to volunteer so they can actually realize these are people with feelings who didn't have parents who could give them anything they wanted.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing them because you don\u2019t like an opinion that they were only sharing with their parents, the people they should be able to talk to about anything.  Good luck getting them to be honest with you about anything ever again.", "YTA. Yea, I don't like the things they were saying either. But...in terms of behaviour, they didn't exactly break any rules here. They didn't ruin Milan's party or say anything hurtful to him. Before jumping to punishment, I'd have expected you to speak to them about the things they were saying and try to understand where this was coming from.\n\nI think you're going overboard and none of this will teach your daughters anything positive in terms of charity. $300 is a lot; I'm an adult and I'd struggle to raise this by July. Giving their allowance to charity doesn't do anything other than teach them that opinion = punishment and charity = punishment. \n\nFrankly, I'm sceptical of some charities - I think it's always good to see what impact they actually have and/or what their specific plan is to help others before donating. Additionally, time can be more valuable than money. Why not find them somewhere to volunteer where they can see the positive benefits charities can bring? That might be a more sensible place to start.", "YTA. Your girls are 15. Obviously they weren't TAUGHT charity, compassion and empathy and that's on YOU.", "Your twins are 15 and are already demonstrating a distinct lack of empathy, which I agree is a serious issue which needs to be dealt with in order to help your kids from becoming shitty human beings,  But an all-punishment (especially involving multiple punishments) and no-rehabilitation approach will likely be ineffective.  I think a better approach would be require them to find volunteer work involving the disadvantaged (something hands-on rather than raising money through chores) and try to light a fire under their humanity.  Incorporating a charitable element into the birthday celebrations might also be a good step.  Soft YTA.", "ESH. You've failed to raise compassionate children. Punishing them for this will not inspire their compassion.\n\nMaybe read some parenting books before your kids start voting Republican.", "Nta, but your going about this wrong.  Rather than tying a punishment to charity, try to build/foster empathy.  Volunteer, both you and them.  Go to the Salvation Army, join Habitat for Humanity.  Let them truly see the struggles that others have both so they appreciate what they have and can see the other side of things.  Get them out of their bubble.", "YTA. I\u2019m totally on board with you telling them to give their allowance to charity as punishment for what they\u2019ve said and how they feel but taking away their actual birthday parties is not fair. It\u2019s your job as parents to raise your children right and to teach them the value of the dollar and to help others when they can. So them being selfish is your fault for how you raised them not theirs and taking away their parties will not help the situation at all. Instead of taking the parties away have them volunteer for some of these charities throughout the summer and hopefully by the end they\u2019ll have learned to be kinder.", "Your girls are entitled and judged their cousin for being kind. I think greatly scaling things back would be good, so they no longer just expect to be given everything. They don't sound mature enough to not blame this on Milan. \n\nNTA. You have great intentions, but they lack empathy.", "YTA, but something to keep in mind about birthdays, Christmases and the like...\n\nYou only get 18 of those with your child. Practically speaking, only about 12 where they want to enjoy it like a kid.\n\nIt's your decision, but personally I would separate a punishment from birthdays.", "NTA - It appears your on track to raising a couple of snobby bullies. The fact that they are laughing at  their cousin and demeaning his efforts, demonstrates they need a harsh reality check.", "NTA and if your 14 year old daughters are using their social media accounts to send hateful messages about their parents, they don't need those phones for a while either.", "NTA. And they should have being doing chores to earn their allowance in the first place.", "I'd honestly make them work at a soup kitchen as well maybe 150 dollars each and working at the soup kitchen?  NTA but just donating the money probably won't do much", "NTA\n\nBut. As others have pointed out -- you are the reason your kids lack empathy and view their cousin this way.", "are you serious? teenagers do obnoxious things and have shallow opinions. the way an actual parent would handle this is probing on why they feel that way and coaching them through the discussion. YTA 1000x over. you can dislike things your children do without throwing down a gauntlet of a punishment on them. be better than a teenager.", "NTA - your girls are obviously lacking complete and total empathy for those who are not as well off as others. They need to learn compassion.", "NTA, but instead of making them do chores you should be making them volunteer at some of the charities so they can see first hand how very little can go a long way and what hardships they are fortunate enough to avoid. You have raised two unbelievably entitled children and YOU need to rectify that FAST. This is on you and your wife- your kids are absolute brats, and need healthy a dose of reality.", "YTA. Making them donate their allowance is one thing, making them raise $300 is way over the top.", "YT huge A.", "NTA.   Tell your family to keep their noses out of your business.", "NTA. It\u2019s never too late to instill morally sound traits in your kids.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughters are products of their environment.\n\nSome self reflection and family learning together might be in order here.\n\nThey're teenagers, their brains and thought processes aren't fully formed yet.\n\nYou and your wife need to educate yourselves before trying to pasa punishment on your offspring.", "What your teaching them is that 1. You care for Milan more than them, and 2. they cannot be honest with you for fear of punishment.\n\nThey haven't actually done anything wrong, so YTA.", "No. You don't take away a kid's birthday party no matter how old they are or for what the reason is. You need to teach them about these different things that they aren't too familiar with. But they allowance thing where they're allowance goes to charity is a good place to start. Next they should be volunteering in a soup kitchen, a second hand shop, or maybe another area where they are helping other people. That would teach them what myelin has been talking about all this time and trying to do something about all this time. Being wealthy gives them an advantage over others. And if they've got all the neat phones and tech devices and anything else that's high dollar that they will start laughing at people who have less than them and are in a poor spot. I grew up poor. But I was taught to be glad for what I had and make sure that I ate the food on my plate because I might not get it tomorrow. Your daughters need that lesson as well.", "YTA.\n\nAll you're teaching them is that they're \"wrong.\" You're not teaching them why they're wrong. Sit down and have a chat with them. Make them read a few articles, books, watch some videos. Make them learn.", "The punishment is too much for the crime. You tried to kill an ant with a nuke. YTA", "YTA. You can't punish kids into having good values or into not having abhorrent opinions. Good values are instilled by modeling them consistently in the long term.

YTA, wtaf?!", "Milan sounds like an awesome young kid. Growing up in that area and showing concern for those that do not have as much is a sweet thing. \n\nHowever it does seem that your kids have grown up sheltered in the rich lifestyle. I would not take away their parties, but I would start going with your kids to begin helping out with groups and functions that are there to support the less fortunate.

Your girls grew up selfish and entitled, it\u2019s never too late to instil these values but change your approach. They should do chores/something for the community to earn their allowance going forward, but don\u2019t let that impact their party - you\u2019ll be going back on your previous agreements and foster resentment (towards you and \u201cthe poor\u201d)", "YTA.

This is a teaching moment, not a punishment moment. You are supposed to help your children to understand the situations that other people face and how to be compassionate about it. Why are you expecting them to reach that conclusion on their own without having modeled it for them and having spoken about it with them? Punishing them for not understanding doesn't work, and it's naturally making them resent you. You approached this wrong, and it's gonna be a tough fix. \n\nWhat I would do now, in your shoes: Admit that you handled this inappropriately. Let them have their birthdays--You aren't supposed to earn those. Set aside time every week to learn about diversity, equity, and inclusion. Research charities and community orgs together. Put aside a budget for charity and allow your daughters to choose where they'd like to donate. In Judaism we have Tzedakah boxes--if you have more than you need, you put some money in a little box your family keeps, and then donate that money either to charities or mutual aid.

All that teaches them is to hide things from you. \n\nSecondly, as many people here have pointed out: *why* do they have selfish opinions and think caring for others is \"cringe\"?  Why had your nephew never seen anything outside of very wealthy areas until he started on his travel team, and have no context for understanding the existence of poverty until he saw and researched it himself? If he's just a year younger than your daughters, and he had never been outside his sheltered, privileged bubble until this travel team, have your daughters ever even had that minimal exposure to the fact that not everyone has the things they have? \n\nHave you and your wife ever made an effort to explain poverty and inequity to them? Do you and your wife model caring for others and empathy for those outside your own family and friend circles? Do you and your wife donate, volunteer, protest, or put in time and energy promoting policies that help others, and discuss what you are doing and what values motivate it and why it is important with your daughters? If you don't, how do you expect them to understand? \n\nYou may now be TELLING them to care about others, and punishing them for not *performing* empathy with people in poverty, but if you've never shown them with your actions or discussed with them *why* caring about others and working against injustice and inequity and to help other people is important, that's all you're teaching them to do: fake it. \n\nIt sounds to me a bit like you favor Milan and are more upset that your kids called him cringe than that they don't fake caring about marginalized people in the way you suddenly want them to.", "NTA\n\nYour daughters are entitled and mean.

I think you can definitely reprimand your kids for saying super unkind things, especially if they're being unkind without really realizing it. He's still TA for the way he's going about teaching his kids to be charitable and care about people in other socioeconomic situations, but what they said still definitely needs some action from the parents.", "Charities dont wanna be your support system to teach your kids a lesson. They are already dealing with disadvantaged people and those people don\u2019t need miniature ah looking down on them.  Still agree with the judgement on soft YTA tho.", "How is this punishment going to teach them compassion? More likely, it will teach them resentment.", "That\u2019s the parents fault. The parents didn\u2019t teach them that so now they get punished for acting in what is probably a total normal way for them? I agree it\u2019s wrong to act the way they did but it sounds like they\u2019ve grown up well off for money so of course they wouldn\u2019t think about people who make less", "This isn\u2019t going to install morals into them. It\u2019s going to make them resistant to giving to charity in the future.", "is 31 too late?", "This! You teach your daughters by showing them! If you don\u2019t do anything to give back other than writing a check, of course they won\u2019t learn anything. We sent our kids to private school and it was a requirement for the kids to do service hours. Feeding the homeless was what our kids loved to do the most. But we instilled that in our children at a young age. Yes, we are privileged but we weren\u2019t raised that way and didn\u2019t want our kids to not understand real suffering. \n\nActions speak louder than words.", "Gemuine question here but is the experience of volunteering the one thing placing it above donations in your mind?\n\nI'm not trying to be snarky but I'm someone who donates to charity but I don't volunteer. The way I see it my money is earned from me spending my time working and by donating that money I am donating an extension of my time. Im really atruggling to see how that means i lack compassion or awareness just because its easier than volunteering? Idk but your take about donations not showing compassion or awareness doesn't sit well with me.", "Thank you! Came here to say this. I\u2019m the coordinator of a program at our local food pantry and I get more people contacting me than you can imagine who \u201cwant to teach [their] kids to be more grateful for what they have.\u201d\n\nUh, no. You can come sort food. You can come clean. You can organize a food drive in your community. But what you *will not* do is come gawk at my clients when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable to teach your kid a lesson in gratitude. This is a food pantry. It is not a zoo. It\u2019s not a parade. These clients are not here for your amusement. \n\nBy all means, volunteer. But don\u2019t use someone\u2019s unfortunate circumstances as some sort of reductive lesson in appreciation. \n\nAs for OP\u2026your kids learned this attitude from somewhere. What have you done to foster a *meaningful* sense of giving prior to this? Further, your punishment is only going to make them bitter and angry and view giving to others as taking away from themselves, which it should *never* be.", "Nah. Maybe 55.", "I completely understand your reasoning. So allow me to rephrase: \n\nWhen compassion and understanding of those less fortunate is already engrained in a person, then yes financial donations are a great way to help those in need. Your mindset in dictating your values.\n\nIn the OPs daughters\u2019 case, they do NOT have that mindset and I question if making monetary donations will change that. Rather putting in the time by working with communities in need is a good way to develop compassion and awareness.\n\nIn short, financial donations may not be the best way to develop compassion if it is not already there to begin with.", "Volunteering and donating are both super valuable to cause, but have different impacts on the individual.  It's easy for Joe Millionaire to write a check for $20k, it doesn't impact him.  But going and getting his hands dirty can really help him see things from another perspective.  \n\nYou have perspective already - that's great.  The OPs children do not, thus doing the work will accomplish more in terms of who they become than subbing birthday/allowance money.", "I agree completely. When I was younger I donated time to various things. Sometimes because I was obligated to by various school clubs but there were places that I volunteered where it was just because I enjoyed being there.\n\nNow I don't have that time so I donate money but it started with volunteering time.\n\nThat said, I think volunteering by or with teens who aren't doing it voluntarily should be done carefully and not in any positions where they are in contact with the community that organizations are serving.\n\nThe perfect volunteer opportunities here are going to be things like painting a building or gardening or dealing with boxes of stuff.\n\nI also think this is more about OP being mad that they and SO failed at parents are teaching charity and empathy. And that's not something you can punish into existence.", "I think this is clearly a case of me taking a single sentence from your whole comment and taking what you said as as absolutes when thats a terrible idea\ud83d\ude02. Cause I totally agree with you the kids/parents in this situation would benefit way more from volunteering than donating. \n\nSorry if my original comment came off more aggressive than I intended I was genuinely curious about your opinion."]}
