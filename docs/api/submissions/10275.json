We've been quite lucky and now each account could pay for four years of private college, easily.\n\nThe issue is with our eldest (24f), let's call her Natasha. She's married to her wife (Miriam), who is a nice girl but has no ambition whatsoever. We split the cost of the wedding with her parents. Miriam has a masters, but her job is something with little kids on the spectrum, and it's only part time. She also has a condition that I don't want to get into too much here that makes her more burdensome.\n\nWe paid for Natasha's college out of pocket, reasoning we can save the college fund for grandkids, etc. She first got a job when she graduated, but then she wanted to go to grad school. We said OK! We will pay for your grad school as long as you study hard and be responsible.\n\nRecently, the girls started making noises about taking foster children into their home, an apartment very close to campus that WE pay for. We said that's probably not a good idea, but it just went in one ear and out the other. Natasha texted the other day saying that her tuition for spring semester is due, and after discussing it with her father, I asked if she was still planning I'm taking in foster kids. She replied that they were almost done with the process and could have their home open in a little as a month.\n\nAt that point, I texted a calm and measured paragraph explaining that we couldn't support them anymore.

So, Reddit AITA?\n\nETA\nIt would be completely different if one of them had their own baby, and I told them as much.\nThe state more or less reimburses foster parents for what they spend on the kids, the issue from where I'm standing is more that I don't think she should be studying and doing 24/7 charity work at the same time.\nThe college savings account was set up so that we stayed the owners even after Natasha came of age, I don't know exactly how but that's how it set up. There's enough money in there to pay for eight years of education several times over, it's not about that. When she got into grad school we said we would transfer it over to her, but then once she got started we realized it was a better financial move to pay for each semester out of pocket.", "created_utc": 1676725185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115es95/aita_for_deciding_not_to_pay_my_daughters_tuition/", "score": 709, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is a grown ass woman, married and on the cusp of expanding her family. All the while not paying for her own lifestyle or education. Yes you set up a college fund and I think you should pay this semester(since it\u2019s too late for her to back out). But you can stop paying for their rent. You saved the money for her but ultimately it\u2019s your money. I don\u2019t think she is entitled to it. It\u2019s time for them both to figure out their own path, money excluded.", "So neither Natasha nor Miriam have any income? And they want to have children now? That might sound heartless, but I think you should try getting a stable job before you start a family. Not because students or jobless people don't deserve families, but because it's fucking scary to be responsible for several people without having the means to support them.\n\nNAH in my opinion, I just think Natasha and Miriam should look into being a bit more independent before they take on such massive responsibility.\n\nEdit: I forgot that Miriam has a part time job. Doesn't really change anything about my comment though, since they can obviously not financially support themselves let alone another child.", "NTA, and I don't understand the Y T A's. You've already paid for your daughter's college and are now paying for grad school and the apartment she lives in. I think it's entirely reasonable for you to want your daughter to focus on her post grad. Looking after foster children isn't a walk in the park, she will get distracted from her studies. If she wants to do this she can wait until grad school is finished and she's financially independent.\n\nYou don't seem to like your daughter in law much, which is a different issue, but in these circumstances NTA.", "NTA. You paid for her college education. That is beyond what many kids gets. On top of that you paid grad school and rent? That\u2019s a lot of money they are taking from you. Wanting to take on fosters kids is a noble and compassionate act, but not one they should focus on if they can\u2019t afford their own rent. I think it\u2019s fair to say that if they choose to take on this life-altering venture, then you may choose to change your level of financial support.", "NTA.

Op said they would pay for college as long as she studied and was Responsible. \n\nOp doesn\u2019t thin that his daughter is being responsible. She is making choices by spending someone else\u2019s money. At this point she is taking advantage of her parents. As long as she goes to school she will continue to have mom and dad fund her lifestyle. She is a married 24 year old.

She should probably be working more and contributing to the costs of rent.  \n\nIn my book, getting married is an emancipating action.

Only someone who has never had kids would argue children don't take up an enormous amount of attention. And these are traumatised kids so probably need more than your average, well adjusted kid. If Natasha expects her parents to pay her rent and grad school costs when she is 24 years old, then she needs to abide by the conditions that privilege comes with. OP is not saying she shouldn't or can't ever foster kids. She is saying she is only prepared to support her daughter and her wife, and that is it. Frankly, I think that is pretty generous. \n\nThe one thing I will ding OP for is OP should have made it clear when they first said they were thinking seriously about fostering that you would stop paying their rent and tuition. This should not have come as a surprise to them. EsH.", "NTA. The daughter and her wife are adults who can barely, if that, support themselves.

That way you have honored your word about paying for grad school. From then on it's on her to find a way to pay for what she wants.", "NTA. They are trying to make a terrible mistake and you don't have to help fund that. They are being irresponsible and unfair to any future foster child.

I do think that you're backing out of the agreement too close to the deadline though.\n\nWhat about telling her she's not holding up her side of the deal and you're paying only for this semester and, I don't know, maybe the next three months of rent and then she's on her own since she's in an enough comfortable position in life to be able to afford a place, a marriage, a kid, and school? Could this be an acceptable solution for you?", "NTA they have absolutely no idea tje challenges of foster parenting and the system in generally as her wife works, most of the childcare will fall on her, how will she manage this and grad school?

Is it your money or her money? This might be where the problem stems from. It still feels very controlling. \n\nAdding also, You told Miriam that she didn\u2019t know for sure that your daughters grades would slip but you don\u2019t know either, your just assuming your more right. While I agree that bringing a kid into a situation is difficult, people do still manage to maintain jobs and make things work. No one knows how this will effect her grades or even if it will. They are making a choice as a couple and you are choosing to disagree and then pull funding away from them.\n\nIf you felt this strongly, there should have been way more conversations about the conditions that you were gifting her this money.

Something tells me that the DIL figured out that if she became a foster parent, she could get paid for it without having to go try to work full time and that OP's daughter could just sort of skate through school with OP subsidizing their lifestyle.\n\nNow, the woman could be a perfectly lovely human being, who the heck knows. However, I know from my own experience from being a foster parent that the ones who have \"child focused social worker degrees\" are usually the ones who figure out how to make a steady, decent income from fostering. We had a couple in our group that used to drive me nuts. They had, like 5 fosters, all with varying degrees of \"diagnosed behavior issues\" and neither of them worked, just stayed home with the kids. Which, in of itself wouldn't be a bad thing IF they were dedicating themselves to the betterment of the foster kids and helping them become healthy kids. They weren't. He played video games all day, the kids were in public school full time, after school care, the whole nine yards and she just mainly went and goofed off at her mom's house all day. Both of them had \"child development\" degrees. One of their placements was friends with one of our fosters. He was always at our house, where I was constantly worried about teaching our fosters about just basic life stuff they were behind on, homework, not getting trouble in school AND working full time. My husband was disabled at the time, and home, but he was the SAHD role and since our fosters were usually older kids, he was responsible for getting them off to school, home from school, chores, ect. I just really felt so angry on the kid's behalf when he said to me one day \"Mrs. X doesn't teach us how to cook or grocery shop. How come you make M do all that with you?\". So, I had to explain to him that as a parent, it was MY job to teach them everything they would need to know about being an adult and being able to take care of themselves one day. Which meant I needed to ensure they knew how to budget, shop, cook, clean and look after their own well being; so when they were adults, they could function successfully. That because I loved M, I wanted her to one day be able to fully take care of herself without being afraid of going hungry, homeless or without the means to even take a hot shower. Which meant teaching her how to do these things while she was in my care.  It was also saddening to hear him mention how his foster dad wouldn't even let him play video games on the xBox, but my husband would regularly have these little \"game parties\" where he and the kids would just make a bunch of snacks and drinks then just go to town playing video games or watching movies. (There were times my living room was so crowded and noisy, I just had to go outside to hear myself think straight)\n\nI guess that is my long-winded way of saying that 1. I always suspect the motivations of anyone with any kind of \"child focused social worker\" degree suddenly deciding becoming a foster parent is a great idea when they don't even have the actual means to take care of themselves without someone else paying their bills. It's usually because of money, not out of the goodness of their hearts. 2. Fostering is HARD WORK. You don't just get to take the kid in and it's like a cat; just feed it once in a while and ignore it. (Thought why you'd do that to a cat, I don't know. Cats are pretty independent critters, but mine have always been complete needy little balls of insane fur.)\n\nOP is completely justified in removing her financial support. If her daughter and the DIL want to foster, great. But, they need to pay their own bills and be responsible for their own shit, not just expect OP to subsidize the extra expense. Because, yeah, fostering can get expensive. Especially if you have a kid that needs extra services. The state will pay for therapy and stuff, but it's on the foster parent to provide transportation costs, play chauffer, play 24/7 caregiver and all that. (Hell, M cost me an extra $25 in gas for my car per week because her alternative school was 20 minutes from my house and she had court ordered therapy and community service she had to do, which required a guardian's presence. I was so up in that girl's business it wasn't even funny. She was a little taken aback at first, because her own parents had just sort of left her to her own devices. But, if I wasn't constantly supervising her, it was my husband, or our adult daughter.)\n\nI can't foster anymore due to my health. But, all of my fosters are still up under foot in one way or another.  M and L, one of the boys, just wandered in for coffee before work. L went and raided the fridge for leftovers; they know they are welcome to go get anything to eat or drink in my home. He saw we are down to half a gallon of milk and hollered \"Hey, M, remind me to stop on the way home from work and get Ma milk!\" (I can get my own milk, but it's sweet) One of the other boys texted to say he's going with his GF to hike, and might stop by later. I texted back I'd be working but his sister would be here and tell her to take out more stuff if they were staying for dinner. I just got back \"Nah, Ma, we'll bring Papa Murphy's!\". So, I guess I am having pizza for dinner tonight. Oh, and they adore my dad, who just kind of went \"Oh, I have more grandkids!\" when I first started fostering. Then dragged his brother into it, as well as my brothers, so now, the fosters have been assimilated fully. But, not all foster parents treat their kids well. I think I sort of fell into it because I had lost children of my own. As a parent, you shouldn't ever outlive your kids. And I couldn't understand parents who didn't take care of their kids well. It started with the waifs and strays my daughter would bring home after school. They were in my house, so I treated them like mine. To me, it wasn't about the money. It was about doing what was right. Which meant being a mom to them when they needed it.\n\nNow, I swear I turn around and one of them is right there going \"Hey, Ma\". A couple of them have kids of their own now and we're \"grandparents\" to them.\n\nI sincerely hope that OP's daughter and DIL are doing it for the right reasons. But, something tells me that once OP withdraws her financial support and they actually get a placement, things will go sideways really fast. I hope not. But, it likely will.", "Master\u2019s, chronic illness, who works with special needs children!", "Don't forget the part \"does something with kids on the spectrum\".

Like, it's their money (though I don't understand about the college fund and wish OP would elaborate) but yeah, OP definitely seems like an AH generally. Especially with \"if they had their own kid, it would be different\" when talking about 2 women. Like, The whole thing comes off as icky tbh", "OP seems a bit controlling too. She wouldn't be an AH for deciding not to pay any longer, but she seems like she's dangling the fact that she's paying over their heads as a way to exert control.", "Yes, I picked up on that too.\n\n>Miriam has a masters, **but** her job is something with little kids on the spectrum, and **it's only part time**. She also has **a condition** that I don't want to get into too much here that makes her **more burdensome**.\n\nI don't know what kind of condition or disability Miriam has, but it could very well be the reason why she's working part time. If that's the case, then OP is shaming a disabled person for working part time and being a burden. That's very ableist. And A-H behavior.\n\nA lot of people with a master degree end up working in different fields. There's no shame in changing professions. I don't understand why OP thinks working with autistic children is a bad job. To me it seems like Miriam chose a job where she can make a real difference in children's lives. And her daughter Natasha and Miriam are probably wanting to foster children in their home for the same reasons. I think that's a very honorable thing to do.\n\n>We paid for Natasha's college out of pocket, reasoning we can **save the college fund for grandkids**, etc. She first got a job when she graduated, but then she wanted to go to grad school. We said OK! **We will pay for your grad school as long as you study hard and be responsible.**\n\nOP and her husband have promised their daughter Natasha to pay for her education as long as she studies hard and is responsible. Natasha seems to do both and isn't slacking.\n\nBut now OP has added additional conditions because she doesn't agree with Natasha's and Miriam's choice to foster children. To me it seems like OP uses her money to control her daughter's life. I think all people who chose to control others (by money or otherwise) are A-H's, especially parents that try to control their adult children.\n\nAnd what's with the \"casual\" grandkids remark? What's the plan here? She wants to withhold her daughter's college fund until she gives her grandchildren?\n\n>DIL Miriam called me and was kind of awkward. I explained my reasoning and she said OK. She said **Natasha's grades probably aren't going to go down at all from having a kid in the house**, and I said that would be nice, **but you don't know that for sure.**\n\nThere's no way to know if and how fostering children is going to impact Natasha's grades. But I don't think it's very reasonable to punish Natasha over a possibility, something that hasn't happened. To me it seems reasonable to communicate to Natasha that she can make her own choices but she needs to keep up her grades as that's the pre-agreed condition they discussed.\n\n>The whole point of paying for everything is so **Natasha wouldn't have to work**, not so **she could be distracted and deal with someone else's kids**.\n\nI also don't like OP's very condescending tone towards foster children. It's very clear OP values money above compassion and generosity. I don't understand why OP isn't proud of her daughter's great character.\n\nNo parent is obligated to pay for their adult child's education, but if you promise your daughter you will pay for tuition and rent on the one pre-agreed condition of studying hard and being a responsible adult, then I think it is an A-H move to retract your promise because you don't particularly like your daughter's wife and their life choices.\n\nMy vote is YTA because of all the reasons above.", "Also a college fund that's hers ie in her name but then not allowing her access is fraud.", "Agreed", "I agree.", "you would be amazed how many masters programs lead to low paying jobs.
