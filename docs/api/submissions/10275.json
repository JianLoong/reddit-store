Your daughter is a grown ass woman, married and on the cusp of expanding her family. All the while not paying for her own lifestyle or education. Yes you set up a college fund and I think you should pay this semester(since it\u2019s too late for her to back out). But you can stop paying for their rent. You saved the money for her but ultimately it\u2019s your money. I don\u2019t think she is entitled to it. It\u2019s time for them both to figure out their own path, money excluded.", "So neither Natasha nor Miriam have any income? And they want to have children now? That might sound heartless, but I think you should try getting a stable job before you start a family. Not because students or jobless people don't deserve families, but because it's fucking scary to be responsible for several people without having the means to support them.\n\nNAH in my opinion, I just think Natasha and Miriam should look into being a bit more independent before they take on such massive responsibility.\n\nEdit: I forgot that Miriam has a part time job. Doesn't really change anything about my comment though, since they can obviously not financially support themselves let alone another child.", "NTA, and I don't understand the Y T A's. You've already paid for your daughter's college and are now paying for grad school and the apartment she lives in. I think it's entirely reasonable for you to want your daughter to focus on her post grad. Looking after foster children isn't a walk in the park, she will get distracted from her studies. If she wants to do this she can wait until grad school is finished and she's financially independent.\n\nYou don't seem to like your daughter in law much, which is a different issue, but in these circumstances NTA.", "NTA. You paid for her college education. That is beyond what many kids gets. On top of that you paid grad school and rent? That\u2019s a lot of money they are taking from you. Wanting to take on fosters kids is a noble and compassionate act, but not one they should focus on if they can\u2019t afford their own rent. I think it\u2019s fair to say that if they choose to take on this life-altering venture, then you may choose to change your level of financial support.", "Nta.

Op said they would pay for college as long as she studied and was Responsible. \n\nOp doesn\u2019t thin that his daughter is being responsible. She is making choices by spending someone else\u2019s money. At this point she is taking advantage of her parents. As long as she goes to school she will continue to have mom and dad fund her lifestyle. She is a married 24 year old.

She should probably be working more and contributing to the costs of rent.  \n\nIn my book, getting married is an emancipating action.  Your daughter and her wife should be paying their own expenses.

If Natasha expects her parents to pay her rent and grad school costs when she is 24 years old, then she needs to abide by the conditions that privilege comes with. OP is not saying she shouldn't or can't ever foster kids. She is saying she is only prepared to support her daughter and her wife, and that is it. Frankly, I think that is pretty generous. \n\nThe one thing I will ding OP for is OP should have made it clear when they first said they were thinking seriously about fostering that you would stop paying their rent and tuition. This should not have come as a surprise to them. EsH.", "NTA. The daughter and her wife are adults who can barely, if that, support themselves.

Her wanting to do grad school is awesome, but doesn't mean it needs to be on your dime. You were still willing to support her so she could focus on it completely, which is awesome, but if she's doing other stuff in addition to grad school, she might as well just get a job to pay for it and take her time with the program.", "Nta.

That way you have honored your word about paying for grad school. From then on it's on her to find a way to pay for what she wants.", "NTA. They are trying to make a terrible mistake and you don't have to help fund that. They are being irresponsible and unfair to any future foster child. They don't make enough to support themselves and they want to take on an 18+ year commitment that will be harder to take care of than themselves.", "NTA she's taking advantage of the situation. I do think that you're backing out of the agreement too close to the deadline though.\n\nWhat about telling her she's not holding up her side of the deal and you're paying only for this semester and, I don't know, maybe the next three months of rent and then she's on her own since she's in an enough comfortable position in life to be able to afford a place, a marriage, a kid, and school? Could this be an acceptable solution for you?", "NTA they have absolutely no idea tje challenges of foster parenting and the system in generally as her wife works, most of the childcare will fall on her, how will she manage this and grad school?

That her wife works with autistic children? That her wife has a medical condition you consider burdensome? That they want to foster children instead of having biological ones?

It still feels very controlling. \n\nAdding also, You told Miriam that she didn\u2019t know for sure that your daughters grades would slip but you don\u2019t know either, your just assuming your more right. While I agree that bringing a kid into a situation is difficult, people do still manage to maintain jobs and make things work. No one knows how this will effect her grades or even if it will. They are making a choice as a couple and you are choosing to disagree and then pull funding away from them.\n\nIf you felt this strongly, there should have been way more conversations about the conditions that you were gifting her this money.

You talk terribly of Miriam so I already can't stand you. People are not \"burdensome\" and you don't have \"no ambition\" with a master's degree and working with disabled kids.

Foster kids aren't \"someone else's kids,\" they're society's children and we all have a duty to help take care of them. Shame on you. You clearly are well off. You withhold money from Natasha to control and manipulate her. You refuse to help those less fortunate who need love and stable households (the foster kids), and you're acting like they're some kind of dirty street rats. Being a foster parent is an amazing, caring action and I applaud both Natasha and Miriam for wanting to take kids in.\n\nLots of people who don't have financial stability have kids. I was born to someone. They were fucking terrible. I would trade them for lesbian foster parents that loved and wanted me, even if we were poor. I was poor any damn way, and abuse, and screwed up for the rest of my life because my parents were straight and everyone insisted they keep a kid they didn't want. They didn't have money.

You pay for the semester but after that its on her.", "Why would OP continue to financially support a grown, married woman, who intends on expanding her family?? \n\nIf Miriam has time to take care of a foster child, while Natasha studies, then Miriam can get a better job. Yes, taking working with disabled children is tiring, but so is bringing a (most likely traumatized) child into your home. (She has a masters and only works part time.) \n\nFrankly, the two of them should be independent by now. *(Or at least more independent than they are. They literally only bring in the money from Miriam\u2019s part time job. Yet want to foster children??)* Miriam has a masters, so she\u2019s at least 24, most likely older.

OP has some questionable language in a couple points of the post but ultimately they are right. This couple is not even able to support themselves financially, why are they planning on fostering?

OP, YTA for all of these things. So many strange reasons to not support your child.

Even if he isn\u2019t helping with the kid financially (which he is because he pays his daughters rent and all other bills), the daughter falls at risk of doing poorly at school. She isn\u2019t asking for a cat in the home, or perhaps a new console that could take up her time gaming. This is a child, and one that most likely comes with a lot of trauma. The kid will need to be taken to and from school, will need help with homework, could potentially cause some trouble/rebel while with them, meals will need to be prepped, they will need to put time aside for after school or weekend activities with this child - all of this takes time away from studying.
