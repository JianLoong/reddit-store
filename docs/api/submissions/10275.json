We've been quite lucky and now each account could pay for four years of private college, easily.\n\nThe issue is with our eldest (24f), let's call her Natasha. She's married to her wife (Miriam), who is a nice girl but has no ambition whatsoever. We split the cost of the wedding with her parents. Miriam has a masters, but her job is something with little kids on the spectrum, and it's only part time. She also has a condition that I don't want to get into too much here that makes her more burdensome.\n\nWe paid for Natasha's college out of pocket, reasoning we can save the college fund for grandkids, etc. She first got a job when she graduated, but then she wanted to go to grad school. We said OK! We will pay for your grad school as long as you study hard and be responsible.\n\nRecently, the girls started making noises about taking foster children into their home, an apartment very close to campus that WE pay for. We said that's probably not a good idea, but it just went in one ear and out the other. Natasha texted the other day saying that her tuition for spring semester is due, and after discussing it with her father, I asked if she was still planning I'm taking in foster kids. She replied that they were almost done with the process and could have their home open in a little as a month.\n\nAt that point, I texted a calm and measured paragraph explaining that we couldn't support them anymore. The whole point of paying for everything is so Natasha wouldn't have to work, not so she could be distracted and deal with someone else's kids.\n\nDIL Miriam called me and was kind of awkward. I explained my reasoning and she said OK. She said Natasha's grades probably aren't going to go down at all from having a kid in the house, and I said that would be nice, but you don't know that for sure. I said there's plenty of other ways they could do community service together, even with Miriam's condition. She agreed there probably are other avenues.\n\nMy friends all have different opinions. Some don't understand why Natasha doesn't have access to her college fund since she's over 21, but all I can say is she just doesn't. One thinks I'm the asshole because Natasha's already done one month of work for the semester, and they already have the furniture for the child set up. So, Reddit AITA?\n\nETA\nIt would be completely different if one of them had their own baby, and I told them as much.\nThe state more or less reimburses foster parents for what they spend on the kids, the issue from where I'm standing is more that I don't think she should be studying and doing 24/7 charity work at the same time.\nThe college savings account was set up so that we stayed the owners even after Natasha came of age, I don't know exactly how but that's how it set up. There's enough money in there to pay for eight years of education several times over, it's not about that. When she got into grad school we said we would transfer it over to her, but then once she got started we realized it was a better financial move to pay for each semester out of pocket.\nEtA again\nNone of the kids ever had Control over their education funds, but rent, tuition, and extras got paid every semester. The others honestly were always much more respectful of our generosity, they joined social club/Frats, hung out with kids w/ good families, and presented very good image. Natasha might need a little more direction because she often tries to present a bad image, driving Miriam\u2019s ugly car when we offered to get her a new one, old clothes, hair not done, etc. We even offered for them to live in a nice area while Natasha studies but they insisted on the cheapest apartment possible. Like I said, we're generous and they don't appreciate it.\nThey even wanted to have very small wedding (Which would have been disrespectful to a lot of family members not invited) but fortunately we compromised on that one and everyone was happy.\nNo, we never specifically discussed rules with any kids but I think it's clear that he who pays gets a say. Certainly her siblings have never had any trouble with it.", "created_utc": 1676725185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115es95/aita_for_deciding_not_to_pay_my_daughters_tuition/", "score": 2419, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP is not saying she shouldn't or can't ever foster kids. She is saying she is only prepared to support her daughter and her wife, and that is it.

Around here there are quite a few children that need placements and not very many foster homes.", "If they get approved, then, most states have a setup where the foster families get a stipend per kid to pay for expenses. Something tells me that the DIL figured out that if she became a foster parent, she could get paid for it without having to go try to work full time and that OP's daughter could just sort of skate through school with OP subsidizing their lifestyle.\n\nNow, the woman could be a perfectly lovely human being, who the heck knows. However, I know from my own experience from being a foster parent that the ones who have \"child focused social worker degrees\" are usually the ones who figure out how to make a steady, decent income from fostering. We had a couple in our group that used to drive me nuts. They had, like 5 fosters, all with varying degrees of \"diagnosed behavior issues\" and neither of them worked, just stayed home with the kids. Which, in of itself wouldn't be a bad thing IF they were dedicating themselves to the betterment of the foster kids and helping them become healthy kids. They weren't. He played video games all day, the kids were in public school full time, after school care, the whole nine yards and she just mainly went and goofed off at her mom's house all day. Both of them had \"child development\" degrees. One of their placements was friends with one of our fosters. He was always at our house, where I was constantly worried about teaching our fosters about just basic life stuff they were behind on, homework, not getting trouble in school AND working full time. My husband was disabled at the time, and home, but he was the SAHD role and since our fosters were usually older kids, he was responsible for getting them off to school, home from school, chores, ect. I just really felt so angry on the kid's behalf when he said to me one day \"Mrs. X doesn't teach us how to cook or grocery shop. How come you make M do all that with you?\". So, I had to explain to him that as a parent, it was MY job to teach them everything they would need to know about being an adult and being able to take care of themselves one day. Which meant I needed to ensure they knew how to budget, shop, cook, clean and look after their own well being; so when they were adults, they could function successfully. That because I loved M, I wanted her to one day be able to fully take care of herself without being afraid of going hungry, homeless or without the means to even take a hot shower. Which meant teaching her how to do these things while she was in my care.  It was also saddening to hear him mention how his foster dad wouldn't even let him play video games on the xBox, but my husband would regularly have these little \"game parties\" where he and the kids would just make a bunch of snacks and drinks then just go to town playing video games or watching movies. (There were times my living room was so crowded and noisy, I just had to go outside to hear myself think straight)\n\nI guess that is my long-winded way of saying that 1. I always suspect the motivations of anyone with any kind of \"child focused social worker\" degree suddenly deciding becoming a foster parent is a great idea when they don't even have the actual means to take care of themselves without someone else paying their bills. It's usually because of money, not out of the goodness of their hearts. 2. Fostering is HARD WORK. You don't just get to take the kid in and it's like a cat; just feed it once in a while and ignore it. (Thought why you'd do that to a cat, I don't know. Cats are pretty independent critters, but mine have always been complete needy little balls of insane fur.)\n\nOP is completely justified in removing her financial support. If her daughter and the DIL want to foster, great. But, they need to pay their own bills and be responsible for their own shit, not just expect OP to subsidize the extra expense. Because, yeah, fostering can get expensive. Especially if you have a kid that needs extra services. The state will pay for therapy and stuff, but it's on the foster parent to provide transportation costs, play chauffer, play 24/7 caregiver and all that. (Hell, M cost me an extra $25 in gas for my car per week because her alternative school was 20 minutes from my house and she had court ordered therapy and community service she had to do, which required a guardian's presence. I was so up in that girl's business it wasn't even funny. She was a little taken aback at first, because her own parents had just sort of left her to her own devices. But, if I wasn't constantly supervising her, it was my husband, or our adult daughter.)\n\nI can't foster anymore due to my health. But, all of my fosters are still up under foot in one way or another.  M and L, one of the boys, just wandered in for coffee before work. L went and raided the fridge for leftovers; they know they are welcome to go get anything to eat or drink in my home. He saw we are down to half a gallon of milk and hollered \"Hey, M, remind me to stop on the way home from work and get Ma milk!\" (I can get my own milk, but it's sweet) One of the other boys texted to say he's going with his GF to hike, and might stop by later. I texted back I'd be working but his sister would be here and tell her to take out more stuff if they were staying for dinner. I just got back \"Nah, Ma, we'll bring Papa Murphy's!\". So, I guess I am having pizza for dinner tonight. Oh, and they adore my dad, who just kind of went \"Oh, I have more grandkids!\" when I first started fostering. Then dragged his brother into it, as well as my brothers, so now, the fosters have been assimilated fully. But, not all foster parents treat their kids well. I think I sort of fell into it because I had lost children of my own. As a parent, you shouldn't ever outlive your kids. And I couldn't understand parents who didn't take care of their kids well. It started with the waifs and strays my daughter would bring home after school. They were in my house, so I treated them like mine. To me, it wasn't about the money. It was about doing what was right. Which meant being a mom to them when they needed it.\n\nNow, I swear I turn around and one of them is right there going \"Hey, Ma\". A couple of them have kids of their own now and we're \"grandparents\" to them.\n\nI sincerely hope that OP's daughter and DIL are doing it for the right reasons. But, something tells me that once OP withdraws her financial support and they actually get a placement, things will go sideways really fast. I hope not. But, it likely will.", "Master\u2019s, chronic illness, who works with special needs children!", "Don't forget the part \"does something with kids on the spectrum\".

And A-H behavior.\n\nA lot of people with a master degree end up working in different fields. There's no shame in changing professions. I don't understand why OP thinks working with autistic children is a bad job. To me it seems like Miriam chose a job where she can make a real difference in children's lives. And her daughter Natasha and Miriam are probably wanting to foster children in their home for the same reasons. I think that's a very honorable thing to do.\n\n>We paid for Natasha's college out of pocket, reasoning we can **save the college fund for grandkids**, etc. She first got a job when she graduated, but then she wanted to go to grad school. We said OK! **We will pay for your grad school as long as you study hard and be responsible.**\n\nOP and her husband have promised their daughter Natasha to pay for her education as long as she studies hard and is responsible. Natasha seems to do both and isn't slacking.\n\nBut now OP has added additional conditions because she doesn't agree with Natasha's and Miriam's choice to foster children. To me it seems like OP uses her money to control her daughter's life. I think all people who chose to control others (by money or otherwise) are A-H's, especially parents that try to control their adult children.\n\nAnd what's with the \"casual\" grandkids remark? What's the plan here? She wants to withhold her daughter's college fund until she gives her grandchildren?\n\n>DIL Miriam called me and was kind of awkward. I explained my reasoning and she said OK. She said **Natasha's grades probably aren't going to go down at all from having a kid in the house**, and I said that would be nice, **but you don't know that for sure.**\n\nThere's no way to know if and how fostering children is going to impact Natasha's grades. But I don't think it's very reasonable to punish Natasha over a possibility, something that hasn't happened. To me it seems reasonable to communicate to Natasha that she can make her own choices but she needs to keep up her grades as that's the pre-agreed condition they discussed.\n\n>The whole point of paying for everything is so **Natasha wouldn't have to work**, not so **she could be distracted and deal with someone else's kids**.\n\nI also don't like OP's very condescending tone towards foster children. It's very clear OP values money above compassion and generosity. I don't understand why OP isn't proud of her daughter's great character.\n\nNo parent is obligated to pay for their adult child's education, but if you promise your daughter you will pay for tuition and rent on the one pre-agreed condition of studying hard and being a responsible adult, then I think it is an A-H move to retract your promise because you don't particularly like your daughter's wife and their life choices.\n\nMy vote is YTA because of all the reasons above.", "Also a college fund that's hers ie in her name but then not allowing her access is fraud.", "Agreed", "I agree.", "you would be amazed how many masters programs lead to low paying jobs.

In an effort to discourage her from doing this, you're cutting off her finances, and hiding behind the reasoning that you think she'll be distracted and her grades will drop... which is an excuse anyways because you specifically mentioned it would be different if it was her own child.
