She\u2019s texted me at midnight asking if I wanted to go out and I told her no it\u2019s too late and then proceeded to post on Facebook about how she\u2019s always alone and doesn\u2019t have any friends. She does this anytime someone says they couldn\u2019t hangout even though she usually asks to hangout last minute. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to find a place to hangout with her because she always changes where she wants to meet up.

Her calling you unsupportive is like an addict telling someone they aren't supportive when they tell them why their addiction is causing them trouble. Ditch this person--they're a \"vampire\" that just wants to take and take and never give. You and your friend group will be happier without her.", "NTA - and why are you still friends with someone like that?", "Ooof, she sounds like an awful friend. A lot of that, she can definitely work on & change, but she needs to hear it first. NTA", "NTA - Unsupportive?!?! Exactly what are you supposed to be supporting?  I think what she meant to say is that you're not enabling this disrespectful behavior.", "Nope, NTA. She may not be able to take in the advice but you threw her an honesty lifeline. I'd phase out this friendship - she sounds exhausting - and leave it to her to decide if she wants to change.", "NTA! She asked your opinion. You gave her good constructive feedback. All of these things are changes she can easily make and doing so will help her in the future. Good job!", "NTA Personality is mostly why people like or dislike others.", "NTA. Sometimes people need a little feedback.", "Nta. People need to know the truth.", "NTA\n\nWhat's actually the reason your friend with her still lol?", "NTA. You were actually very supportive, even if she doesn't believe it. The problem is that your friend isn't looking for a solution for her problem, she's fishing for sympathy.\n\nShe seems like a lost cause, imho.", "NTA! TO HAVE A FRIEND IS TO BE A FRIEND why are you friends with this self centred AH? she's an attention seeking, spoilt brat who cares nothing for other people's needs, wants and boundaries. She doesn't want friends, she wants a bunch of ass kissing suckers who will tolerate her appalling behaviour. She needed to hear the truth", "NTA.", "NTA.  Sounds like constructive criticism and solid advice on how to change to immediately improve her social situation.", "NTA.\n\nAm wondering though if your friend is autistic.

So I'm guessing supportive = agree with me in her mind.   \n\n\nOne minor point: You described a bunch of behaviors that are annoying and help explain why people don't want to spend time with her anymore. That's important feedback. Calling it her \"personality\" though, like in the post title, is tough because people can change their behavior but how are they supposed to change their personality?", "NTA", "She sounds impossible and exhausting. NTA", "NTA.  \n\nSometimes people can be annoying and simply oblivious to how their behavior affects others. She asked, and you told her the truth despite it not being easy to hear. I'd say you were supportive in a tough love sense.  \n\nIt sounds like she needs to work on improving her social skills, which can be done.", "The relationship is doomed already. Go all in: give her a detailed and itemized rundown, like you're tossing a grenade behind you as you slow walk away from the explosion.\n\nNTA congratulations on the end of this \"friendship\"!", "NTA, But OP, How are you still friends with her?\nDid she save you from a runaway car or something, because she sounds hella annoying?", "NTA.  She wants everything to be at her convenience but doesn't care if she is inconsiderate or inconveniences anyone else.   You're probably better off ending this friendship", "NTA no one here is shocked this person has no friends", "NTA.\n\nThe truth hurts and she asked for it. That is being supportive, you are telling her exactly why people are hesitant to want to be friends with her.", "Not even that. People can do very well with exhausting personalities. What they can't do well with is disrespect. If you want friends, you can be an asshole sometimes but also show some consideration, like acknowledge that other people exist outside of your need for entertainment.", "autistic people *don\u2019t* lack empathy, that\u2019s a misconception. autistic people actually have a heightened sense of perceived justice, which stems from being very empathetic. they just express emotions in ways that are unfamiliar or unintuitive to neurotypicals. \n\nit\u2019s pretty ableist for you to armchair diagnose like that. autism is a very complex neurotype, not just \u201ci\u2019m a childish asshole\u201d disease :(", "NTA - She asked, you told her.

I was exhausted just reading that.", "Nta ! You told her what she needed to hear ! Not what she wanted to hear ! She likes to play these games as tests of friendship ! But it's a one-way street ! She does not care about you or your friends ! You and your friends are her posse to be seen and not to be heard .drop her , block her, and forget her !", "NTA she asked you were honest. hopefully not cruel but being able to give examples of behavior always helps. that she got upset sounds lke she didn't want a real answer but maybe you did some good.", "Sometimes people need to be patient with their friends. But this is something I honestly do not have patience for. NTA. You were honest with your friend and maybe she'll think on it and learn from it. You don't get to be the friend that is \"brutally honest\" or the friend who flakes on everything and not own up to it. If the pattern happens enough, your friends are just going to get tired of inviting you places and avoid you completely.", "NTA", "She's manipulating the situation to appear to be the victim. It's not okay. Either that or she has some major mental health issues, or both.", "OP mentioned a friend from \"their group.\" It's possible OP has no desire to still be friends with this person but her choices are either to remain friendly with her, or lose the entire group. My friend group has one of those, too and I just deal with her because the other friends in the group are important to me.", "had a g/f like that years ago. she was incredibly rude to servers in restaurants and i made sure i left big tips just so i could go back , they actually were sympathetic to me.", "She has some mental health issues so I feel bad for her. She refuses to do anything about it even though I\u2019ve provided her with resources to work to get better.", "If she refuses to work on them, then it's time to view her mental health issues as an explanation, not an excuse. It's her responsibility to deal with them or suffer the consequences. Stop cutting her extra slack, because it's probably enabling more than helping.", "NTA. The truth hurts!", "NTA she sounds like she has mental health problems that needs attention, which might help her, but in the mean time she\u2019s being a shitty excuse for a friend.", "NTA... mostly.  When someone comes to you like this, it's often a good idea to ask if they're looking for a \"buck up bucko\" or if they want to get some tactical advice.  If the latter, that's when you can bring up this business of her being unreliable on appointments, and the like.", "NTA for mirroring her behavior to her. Just so you know, it is common with both depression and ADHD for people to make plans when they feel up, only to cancel when the event rolls around and they are down again. Then they try to seize the moment when they feel up. Not being able to make plans reinforces a pervasive idea that no one cares anyway and they are pulled back into the depression.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t excuse if, but may help you decide how or if you want to deal with it", "Not even a fun vampire! No one likes Colin.", "I'm autistic and do not behave like that. I've been a bit moody to friends and withdrawn on occasion, but I know the problem lies with me, and don't blame others. And I definitely don't lack empathy. I just feel overwhelmed around negative emotions, how could I feel them if I lacked empathy? \nIf I have to play psychiatrists with her, I'd say she may be a narcissist. In any case, OP is NTA, but the \"friend\" is."]}
