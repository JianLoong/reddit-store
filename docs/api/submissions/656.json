Your compromise is a great solution.", "NTA but I would just cancel the party - it would seem odd to have a party where one of the hosts wasn't there.\n\nI think your roommate is out of line. You have indicated that you are of legal age to drink. His not wanting to drink is really his issue as he could just leave the house if he feels he would be too tempted - go out for dinner - go to a move - lots of things to do which don't entail drinking.\n\nI understand how someone sober feels though at a drunken party. I don't really drink that much out of choice so being at a party with lots of booze wouldn't be an issue as I would either drink what I wanted or not drink. However, there really is NOTHING as boring as being around drunk people when you aren't drunk. I would do anything rather than willingly be the sober person at a gathering with drunks. Being a bit tipsy after a drink or two is completely different but drunks aren't as funny or fun to be with as they think they are.", "Soft YTA - I completely understand why you wanna have a blast for Halloween but I think planning a boozy Halloween party at the house when your friend is trying to get sober was probably a bad idea in the first place. The fact that you talk about how people could sneak some into their drinks suggests you're not very supportive of him. Being friends with a recovering alcoholic, especially living with one, means making sacrifices it seems like you're not willing to make - which is fine, but then you need to move.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to attend.

I think canceling outright will have negative effects on your friendship, but I also get why you wanna party with everyone.", "ESH, it sucks tht ppl dont know how to have fun without alcohol, but a halloween party with like 5 sober people also wouldnt be that fun. It\u2019s also kind of shitty of you to suggest ppl sneak in alcohol or come already drunk instead of just being honest and telling your roommate that most people don\u2019t want to go to a dry halloween party and that they should probably just call it off or accept that not many people are going to attend. Instead of just ditching the party, be straightforward and tell your roommates you dont want to go/host anymore and you would rather go out with your other friends.", "NTA they should have this from the start, I wouldn\u2018t come either", "Yta. He is your friend going through a tough time support him.   You clearly have no spine since you\u2019re caving to peer pressure.

And you ought to be able to go a night without drinking maybe your friends not the only one with the problem", "Nice job on the compromise! :)", "Nta it\u2019s your house too personally I would cancel your Halloween party and just go to a different party what\u2019s the point if not that many people are going to show up", "That\u2019s a very adult thing to do, wish more people were so understanding and accommodating.", "NTA. He wants to be sober then so be it but don't drag everyone else into it.", "NTA The whole benefit if living off campus is being able to have parties with booze without getting in trouble. Why couldn't your roommate find a sober party to go to so you could have your party in peace?", "NTA you don't have to tip toe around sobriety but for the sake of sobriety you should probably look for a new living situation.", "I'm sorry but she is not responsible for the roommate's sobriety.  The only one responsible for that is the alcoholic.  She can be empathetic and adjust plans, but ruining his sobriety? Nope, only he can do that.", "He's allowed to make requests in his home, just like the rest of the roommates. He's not out of line for making a request that was honored until it looked like there wasn't going to be much of a party. Which honestly it could be an earlier party and then everyone migrates to where the booze is as the night goes on, so there IS a sober place, maybe a sober-up spot outside  for people done hard partying. There's lots of ways to throw a decent party, and if they know people partying elsewhere, why not really make it a decent halloweekend.", "This has been my train of thought as well if I were to just up and leave. Thank you for weighing in!", "Yes, we are all of age to drink.", "Just because she and I go way back, and I want to respect her sobriety considering she is very easily tempted by peer pressure and booze, which I have seen firsthand. That and she really does want to throw and lives here.", "So after talking with people I think this is what we will do. My housemates and I will have our dry Halloween party/potluck earlier in the day with people that want to go.

Killing two birds with one stone!", "However this is also the roommates house too. Recovering from any addiction is hard. It is only respectful that they aren't tempted in their own home.", "The roommate is already drawing those boundaries to protect his sobriety.  One of the guidelines is not to go anywhere in the early days that will affect your sobriety.  He is asking that the party AT THE PLACE WHERE HE LIVES not affect his sobriety.  \n\nHe is doing what he can to protect his sobriety.  Forcing him into a drinking party is cruel, clueless, and absolutely not supportive.", "Yeah honestly this is what we\u2019re doing now. Read my edit.", "of course he can make requests.\n\nHowever for one night, it seems as though he could graciously do something else and let his other roommates have a \\*normal\\* party with alcohol. It's not as if a party with alcohol among people of age is a shocking or abnormal thing. He is the one who for whatever reason doesn't want to be tempted - many ways to avoid this temptation for ONE NIGHT other than being a wet blanket.\n\nMost roommates obligate if they have to be absent for a night for whatever reason.", "On the other hand - hard NTA. It's not your fault that this party has been derailed. \n\nPart of being in recovery is learning either to be around people who are drinking, or that there are some events that you can't attend. I would suggest that the second biggest drinking night of the year is maybe a time to not be involved. \n\nThis might seem harsh, but it's a bit unrealistic for your friend to expect to police an entire party's behaviour because he can't be around liquor. You wouldn't insist that others don't eat peanuts if you were allergic.\n\nI understand your frustration and wanting to leave, and I'd I'd want to abandon it too. The party is already basically cancelled. \n\nAs much as you want to support your friend, I think the best thing you can do is not involve him in plans that involve drinking. You are only in college once, and you shouldn't have to forsake your own enjoyment for the sake of others.\n\nIt's Halloween, you should be allowed to live a little.\n\nHave a good one, whatever you end up doing, OP!", "Fair enough. Sounds like you need roommates that match your mojo, ya know?", "Sounds like a perfect solution. Have fun!", "That's a thoughtful, communicative and fun solution. Perfect. \n\nEnjoy!", "So you want to ostracize the one person instead of going without some booze for a night because...your life is so shitty that you can't go a single event/holiday without a drink in you? Literally OP is using better judgement than you are, now. Not even TRYING to include someone. No it's not your job, but it shows you're an asshole for refusing to even make the attempt to even THINK of someone else besides your own fun/comfort.", "But the party is happening in the house where he lives, it's going to be very difficult for him if people are there drinking. And um I have a peanut allergy and I did always need my flatmates not to being peanuts into the house - I was fine with them eating peanuts *elsewhere* but if they brought it into the house I could be at risk for my life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don't really drink so I am fine with a party without booze. I could literally go for a long time without a drink of any kind.\n\nI am merely commenting that many roommates leave a situation for the night without feeling \"ostracized\" or it being a major big deal.\n\nThere are plenty of things to do I would imagine that don't involve drinking or being in a group that drinks. \n\nI am not sure why the roommate not wanting to be \"tempted\" by booze can demand an alcohol free environment especially since it is only for one night.\n\nIf I were in a living situation and didn't want to be around a person or a thing or an event FOR ONE NIGHT, I would make plans to be away for that ONE NIGHT and let the other people do their thing.", ">your life is so shitty that you can't go a single event/holiday without a drink in you? \n\nIf you want to get personal that cuts both ways. You need everyone else to remain sober because you're such a disgusting pathetic addict you can't control yourself?", "You're right - the peanut allergy thing isn't completely analogous. There's no immediate risk of death for the housemate.", "Your username is really ringing true.", "I really don\u2019t understand the level of hostility especially since I don\u2019t mind being at a dry or wet event but would probably not choose to be at a party where everyone was zonked\n\nHowever personally I would choose spend the evening doing something else if my roommates wanted to do anything that I wasn\u2019t interested in doing. I mean thst is the normal back and forth most communal living situations have and for one night most people would just find something fun to do rather than forbid it. If people were having drunken orgies every night that would be different \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don't actually feel like that I'm just showing him what it feels like to be on the receiving end. \n\nI'd go to a dry event but I'd never go to a dry party. To me a party is something that runs into the next day. If you're not getting onit and babbling shite to each other all night that's not happening. I'd be in bed by 2.\n\nBut yeah I agree with you, I think being the odd man out and expecting everyone else who clearly wants to do something else to take a hit to accommodate what you want to do is incredibly self centred.", "I think we both agree that if your roommates want to use the place occasionally in a way you don\u2019t want, you let them do it and make other plans as necessary.\n\nThat is the nature of living with roommates as you make compromises so long as they are reasonable. And having a party with alcohol for one night is reasonable versus not allowing it.\n\nIf it is constant then it isn\u2019t fair but I am not understanding why the dry person would feel ostracized or offended. I wouldn\u2019t be insulted if I were dieting and my roommates wanted to throw a huge ice cream pizza pasta party and I didn\u2019t want to be tempted, I would just do something else. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Everyone\u2019s ignoring it wasn\u2019t a demand. It was a request that the other non-sober roommates accepted. Why is it alllll on the sober roommate? Also, it\u2019s halloween weekend, everyone he likely knows is partying, why should he leave his own home because his roommates want a party and he doesn\u2019t? It goes both ways, as the other person says. But regardless, it was already agreed upon, and the sober roommate and OP are both NTA, because neither was attempting to ban anyone from the apartment, just that it be sober.edit:a word"]}
