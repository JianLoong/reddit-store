We own a 2 family house and there's another one next door where there front door for the upstairs apartment is next to our driveway. But they do have their own driveway. \n\nWe have owned the house for 2 years now but my husband has lived here his whole life. He says they've been using our driveway to park for a few minutes or to unload their groceries or have their users park in the driveway and have their food delivery drivers park in the driveway for years and it's always annoyed him but he didn't own the house then so he never said anything. Now that he does we've asked them on multiple occasions to stop using our driveway to a point we started putting a cone at the end of our driveway. Here's where the problem started. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I am making the bed and look over to the TV to see that there is someone parked in our driveway and our cone is moved to infant of our car, we park in the back of the driveway (it's the length of the house). So I go out there and see the car is turned off and there is no one around. I go up to their front door and shout up their stairs to tell them to move their car and they have to stop using my driveway and that I've told them multiple times. They have their own driveway, use it and to stop using ours. They started yelling that it was just for a few minutes blah blah blah. I told them I don't care. It's not your property and to stop doing it. Now a few days ago my husband wasn't home and the cone was at the end of the driveway. I walk over to the window and see they've moved the cone again and parked in our driveway to drop stuff off. I went out there and said hey stop using our fucking driveway I don't know how many times I have to tell you but do it again and I will contact your landlord and have your car towed. They stared yelling at me that who cares it's jist a driveway. I told them when they start paying my property taxes they can use it and when they own their own house they'll understand why it's so annoying to have people doing this. They moved their car while screaming out the window how miserable I am and I jist kept saying thank you and walked inside. But bc I wouldn't let them continue yelling and kept saying thank you they got out of their car and started to walk up to my house to fight me and I just continued to walk inside. \n\n\nAm i the asshole here? Should I just let this go or stick to my guns?\n\n\n\nI wrote this at like 6 am this morning and went back to sleep. But I did tell my husband about the fence idea someone had in the comments and we will be putting one up once this polar vortex fucks off\n\nThank you guys!", "created_utc": 1671877821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu78o4/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_to_stop_using_my/", "score": 1104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me it\u2019s extremely weird that they\u2019re going to yell and curse at you because they can\u2019t use your property to do something unnecessary but more convenient for them. Maybe if they needed to help someone with mobility issues out of the car for 5 minutes once in a while I\u2019d understand it, like grandma coming to visit or something. But they want to unload their groceries or be closer to their door just because they feel like it? Too bad. Start not saying anything and just have them towed", "NTA, you should get one of those key lock posts that you can pull up or push down by unlocking it. That stops them from being able to park cars on it. And you can unlock and drop it down when you need to use your drive. I know it sucks to have to pay for something but they will not respect your boundaries and it's likely other renters wouldn't either.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property, they're acting extremely entitled!\n\nOP, you should get them towed next time they try, I'm sure it would shut them off.", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nWhen you asked them to stop, they should have stopped. Your husband should have really asked them before you owned the house. Or he could've asked whoever owned it before you to contact the neighbor's landlord. It's not their property and if something happens to them on your driveway, you might be liable unless you start calling the police to charge them with trespassing.\n\nThe only thing I would consider is if the same people have been renting there for a long time you might have tried to get to know them and see if you could have a neighborly relationship with them, especially if the times they're using your driveway for a few minutes doesn't block your car in or inconvenience you. That favor could lead to them doing things for you. Renters can be good neighbors. But I'm pretty sure that bridge is burnt at this point.", "That would irritate me too.

They make a fortune from towing.", "NTA , fuck this shit. It's your driveway, not theirs, plain and simple. In a perfect world you guys would get along and y'all could talk the whole thing out rationally like adults, but...it sounds like y'all are past that, lollzz.

Don't get shot lollzz", "NTA. *They have their own driveway.* The fact that they\u2019re using yours because it\u2019s more convenient for them is just sounding like sheer laziness (unless there\u2019s a reason like a mobility issue).

Yeah, you\u2019re not TA. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019ve gotten away with it for so long that they\u2019ve just continued to do it because there haven\u2019t been any consequences.", "NTA if they had any injury occur while parked or walking on your property it is a guaranteed fact they will come after you for liability.

Years back, a friend of mine lived in a condo in [major city]. Reserved, off street parking was a RARE commodity in this city and she paid her her space each month in her rent. Her neighbor across the hall didn't have a reserved space, so she asked if it was ok for her to use the space if friend wasn't using it (friend worked and traveled frequently, so space was open fairly often). Friend said fine, but you have to have the space open when I need it. For two years, this arrangement worked great. Neighbor was respectful and it cost friend nothing to be nice - she was paying for the space regardless.\n\nThen, neighbor got a boyfriend who ended up not being so considerate. One Saturday, I was going to visit friend, so she got up at 6am on a Saturday to go park her car on the street and leave her space open for me when I arrived. She gets up, finds a space, all is good. Around 10am, she noticed her neighbor's boyfriends motorcycle in her space. She was pissed because neither had asked if they could use the space, boyfriend just saw it an used it. So, she called neighbor to tell them to move the motorcycle. No answer. She texts, no response. She goes and knocks on their door. She hears them in the apartment, but they won't respond. Being nice, she gives them the benefit of the doubt. She knew I was expected around 1pm, so at 11am, she calls/texts/knocks again. No response. Same at 11:30. Same response.\n\nShe's now tired of dealing with this bullshit for a parking space SHE PAYS FOR EACH MONTH. So, she calls the tow company whose number is prominently posted on the HUGE SIGN in the lot that says \"RESERVED PARKING. VIOLATORS WILL BE TOWED.\" \n\nTow trucks, who lie in wait for this sort of thing in [major city], was there in under 10 minutes. They start hooking up the motorcycle and winching it on to the flat bed. Well, all of a sudden, boyfriend starts coming out SCREAMING. \"DON'T TOW MY MOTORCYCLE. LEAVE IT ALONE.\" and just generally going crazy. Tow drive laughs, finishes winching the bike, tells the guy the number to call and leaves.\n\nGuy then starts screaming at my friend. SCREAMING at her. Why didn't you call me? Why did you tow my bike? And, best of all, you should have just moved it and we could have fit your car and my bike in the space. What an entitled loser!\n\nTo her credit, she remained calm, and simply said, \"First off, no one asked me if it was ok to park IN MY SPACE. MY SPACE THAT I PAY FOR EACH MONTH AND THAT I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY. And, I did call/text/knock three times before I called the truck. You didn't respond and that is on you. Consider any permission either of you have to use the space permanently revoked.
