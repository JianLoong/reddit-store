He says they've been using our driveway to park for a few minutes or to unload their groceries or have their users park in the driveway and have their food delivery drivers park in the driveway for years and it's always annoyed him but he didn't own the house then so he never said anything. Now that he does we've asked them on multiple occasions to stop using our driveway to a point we started putting a cone at the end of our driveway. Here's where the problem started. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I am making the bed and look over to the TV to see that there is someone parked in our driveway and our cone is moved to infant of our car, we park in the back of the driveway (it's the length of the house). So I go out there and see the car is turned off and there is no one around. I go up to their front door and shout up their stairs to tell them to move their car and they have to stop using my driveway and that I've told them multiple times. They have their own driveway, use it and to stop using ours. They started yelling that it was just for a few minutes blah blah blah. I told them I don't care. It's not your property and to stop doing it. Now a few days ago my husband wasn't home and the cone was at the end of the driveway. I walk over to the window and see they've moved the cone again and parked in our driveway to drop stuff off. I went out there and said hey stop using our fucking driveway I don't know how many times I have to tell you but do it again and I will contact your landlord and have your car towed. They stared yelling at me that who cares it's jist a driveway. I told them when they start paying my property taxes they can use it and when they own their own house they'll understand why it's so annoying to have people doing this. They moved their car while screaming out the window how miserable I am and I jist kept saying thank you and walked inside. But bc I wouldn't let them continue yelling and kept saying thank you they got out of their car and started to walk up to my house to fight me and I just continued to walk inside. \n\n\nAm i the asshole here? Should I just let this go or stick to my guns?\n\n\n\nI wrote this at like 6 am this morning and went back to sleep.

To me it\u2019s extremely weird that they\u2019re going to yell and curse at you because they can\u2019t use your property to do something unnecessary but more convenient for them. Maybe if they needed to help someone with mobility issues out of the car for 5 minutes once in a while I\u2019d understand it, like grandma coming to visit or something. But they want to unload their groceries or be closer to their door just because they feel like it? Too bad. Start not saying anything and just have them towed", "NTA, you should get one of those key lock posts that you can pull up or push down by unlocking it. That stops them from being able to park cars on it. And you can unlock and drop it down when you need to use your drive.

Your husband should have really asked them before you owned the house. Or he could've asked whoever owned it before you to contact the neighbor's landlord. It's not their property and if something happens to them on your driveway, you might be liable unless you start calling the police to charge them with trespassing.\n\nThe only thing I would consider is if the same people have been renting there for a long time you might have tried to get to know them and see if you could have a neighborly relationship with them, especially if the times they're using your driveway for a few minutes doesn't block your car in or inconvenience you. That favor could lead to them doing things for you. Renters can be good neighbors. But I'm pretty sure that bridge is burnt at this point.", "That would irritate me too.

They make a fortune from towing.", "NTA , fuck this shit. It's your driveway, not theirs, plain and simple. In a perfect world you guys would get along and y'all could talk the whole thing out rationally like adults, but...it sounds like y'all are past that, lollzz.

Single. Time from now on.", "NTA, it\u2019s your property, \n\nHonestly though Is it a huge deal they use it for a few min to have an easier time unload? Do they damage or fuck up the property? Are they blocking you from going anywhere?\n\nIf you want something done, you\u2019re not gonna be able to tow them, because by the time the tow truck arrives their car will already be long moved.
