We own a 2 family house and there's another one next door where there front door for the upstairs apartment is next to our driveway. But they do have their own driveway. \n\nWe have owned the house for 2 years now but my husband has lived here his whole life. He says they've been using our driveway to park for a few minutes or to unload their groceries or have their users park in the driveway and have their food delivery drivers park in the driveway for years and it's always annoyed him but he didn't own the house then so he never said anything. Now that he does we've asked them on multiple occasions to stop using our driveway to a point we started putting a cone at the end of our driveway. Here's where the problem started. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I am making the bed and look over to the TV to see that there is someone parked in our driveway and our cone is moved to infant of our car, we park in the back of the driveway (it's the length of the house). So I go out there and see the car is turned off and there is no one around. I go up to their front door and shout up their stairs to tell them to move their car and they have to stop using my driveway and that I've told them multiple times. They have their own driveway, use it and to stop using ours. They started yelling that it was just for a few minutes blah blah blah. I told them I don't care. It's not your property and to stop doing it. Now a few days ago my husband wasn't home and the cone was at the end of the driveway. I walk over to the window and see they've moved the cone again and parked in our driveway to drop stuff off. I went out there and said hey stop using our fucking driveway I don't know how many times I have to tell you but do it again and I will contact your landlord and have your car towed. They stared yelling at me that who cares it's jist a driveway. I told them when they start paying my property taxes they can use it and when they own their own house they'll understand why it's so annoying to have people doing this. They moved their car while screaming out the window how miserable I am and I jist kept saying thank you and walked inside. But bc I wouldn't let them continue yelling and kept saying thank you they got out of their car and started to walk up to my house to fight me and I just continued to walk inside. \n\n\nAm i the asshole here? Should I just let this go or stick to my guns?", "created_utc": 1671877821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu78o4/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_to_stop_using_my/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have it towed once, it'll stop. You have already been too nice.", "NTA - can you have them towed next time? Seems like it could escalate.", "NTA I live in a city where driveways are pretty rare. To me it\u2019s extremely weird that they\u2019re going to yell and curse at you because they can\u2019t use your property to do something unnecessary but more convenient for them. Maybe if they needed to help someone with mobility issues out of the car for 5 minutes once in a while I\u2019d understand it, like grandma coming to visit or something. But they want to unload their groceries or be closer to their door just because they feel like it? Too bad. Start not saying anything and just have them towed", "NTA, you should get one of those key lock posts that you can pull up or push down by unlocking it. That stops them from being able to park cars on it. And you can unlock and drop it down when you need to use your drive. I know it sucks to have to pay for something but they will not respect your boundaries and it's likely other renters wouldn't either.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property, they're acting extremely entitled!\n\nOP, you should get them towed next time they try, I'm sure it would shut them off.", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nWhen you asked them to stop, they should have stopped. Your husband should have really asked them before you owned the house. Or he could've asked whoever owned it before you to contact the neighbor's landlord. It's not their property and if something happens to them on your driveway, you might be liable unless you start calling the police to charge them with trespassing.\n\nThe only thing I would consider is if the same people have been renting there for a long time you might have tried to get to know them and see if you could have a neighborly relationship with them, especially if the times they're using your driveway for a few minutes doesn't block your car in or inconvenience you. That favor could lead to them doing things for you. Renters can be good neighbors. But I'm pretty sure that bridge is burnt at this point.", "That would irritate me too. Though I\u2019m not sure what you can do that won\u2019t escalate it worse. I\u2019d contact their landlord and let them know.", "I can\u2019t believe they\u2019d rather get out of their car, move your cone, get back in the car, and park in your driveway instead of just using their own! I live in a duplex (side by side) and we literally share a driveway. There\u2019s no separation except common sense: I park on my half, you park on your half. And we\u2019ve never had a problem. NTA.", "NTA, but you\u2019re needlessly escalating the situation by yelling into their home. Just tow them and be done with it.", "NTA. It's your property, so you do as you please. I year long habit doesn't make it right.", "NTA - Get a \u201cNo Parking sign, vehicles will be towed at owners expense\u201d and then have it towed. You could even call a tow company and let them know the situation and if there is a time they usually do it, the time frame and they will probably keep a truck in the area. They make a fortune from towing.", "NTA , fuck this shit. It's your driveway, not theirs, plain and simple. In a perfect world you guys would get along and y'all could talk the whole thing out rationally like adults, but...it sounds like y'all are past that, lollzz. But if you've asked them several times in the past not to use yours and they just keep doing it anyway then, sounds like your nextdoor neighbors are kinda assholes lolllzzz...\nAlso, he came at you like he wanted to fight? Mannn you need to nip that behavior in the bud. Sounds like a sketchy asshole next door. Who doesn't know how to use words and only understands fists. Be careful, people are fuckin crazy anymore. Don't get shot lollzz", "NTA. *They have their own driveway.* The fact that they\u2019re using yours because it\u2019s more convenient for them is just sounding like sheer laziness (unless there\u2019s a reason like a mobility issue). And them yelling at you? Yeah, you\u2019re not TA. \n\nIt sounds like they\u2019ve gotten away with it for so long that they\u2019ve just continued to do it because there haven\u2019t been any consequences.", "NTA if they had any injury occur while parked or walking on your property it is a guaranteed fact they will come after you for liability. Would suggest a no tresspassing sign to aid your battle and sending a letter certified to the owner of property next door that you will tow at owners expense starting at this date also a notice placed on the car(s) stating they are on private property and subject to towing. Good luck", "NTA- I feel like they think they can park their car all they want because in the past no one told them anything. Also If you could put more than a cone would be easier to end the thing.", "Yo be careful if they're acting like they wanna get physical. tread lightly. MFers are getting crazier and crazier by the minute out there. Do what you gotta do, but don't get stabbed along the way lolzz", "NTA but just get a gate", "NTA, start calling tow companies and ask if the tow at owners expense. Don\u2019t continue to escalate the situation because it can be come disorderly and harassment even if they are in the wrong.", "NTA. I'd understand them using it once in a while to drop off heavy stuff like furniture or appliances or something because it's closer to their front door but not on a daily basis.", "NTA\n\nIt has to be more effort to move the cone around than to use their own driveway, no matter how close it is to their door. \n\nHave it towed every. Single. Time from now on.", "NTA, it\u2019s your property, \n\nHonestly though Is it a huge deal they use it for a few min to have an easier time unload? Do they damage or fuck up the property? Are they blocking you from going anywhere?\n\nIf you want something done, you\u2019re not gonna be able to tow them, because by the time the tow truck arrives their car will already be long moved. You\u2019d need to involve the police \n\nThe food delivery thing isn\u2019t one you can really stop unless you call every single place around you that delivers and tell them not to use the drive way ever and give your address and there\u2019s lol.", "NTA- but I would send them a letter advising them that they will be towed going forward.
