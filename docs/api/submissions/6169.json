They both live in Colorado, though we\u2019re all from Indiana. They came back to Indiana (instead of me flying out there) bc they can afford it more and I didn\u2019t really want to take off work to go out there.\n\nThe problem arises because they expect to spend an obnoxious amount of time with me while they\u2019re here, but I don\u2019t want to break the routine I have going to spend all this extra time with people, even family. Here\u2019s what a typical day looks like while they\u2019re here:\n\nWeekday: \n\n11am-8pm: Mom and Bro work from home in my apartment; I\u2019m out of the apt (mostly at work, sometimes doing whatever with friends)\n\n8pm-12am: I do a few family activities with Mom and Bro, but have a cut off at midnight so I can chill with friends on Discord afterward and wind down\n\n12am-4am: Play League of Legends and chat with friends\n\nWeekend:\n\n1pm-5pm: spend some alone time with Mom\n\n5pm: hard cutoff bc I have plans with friends to go to a party\n\n5pm-next day: Mom and Bro stay in my apartment while I hang out with friends \n\nThey\u2019re big on \u201copen communication\u201d so we sat down and talked about our feelings. The whole conversation felt like a bit of a guilt trip. Mom expressed she\u2019s feeling like I don\u2019t value them or their time very highly, since I\u2019m usually out of the house or heading to my room at the end of the night while they\u2019re visiting, after they spent thousands of dollars and travelled thousands of miles to get here, especially after I didn\u2019t want to travel to them. They complained that they only get a few hours with me per night (which to me seems like a lot) and that the whole time I\u2019m rushing them through the activities we\u2019re doing to be able to go to my room faster (this isn\u2019t true; I remind them politely every so often of our time constraint so we can get cookie decorating/movie/whatever done in time). The only time this actually mattered was when I had us stop halfway through watching a Christmas movie so I could go to my room, but we finished it the next night. No big deal. Mom also said that I only have this routine while they\u2019re here and would otherwise be breaking it to see friends or do whatever, which might be true but honestly that\u2019s what keeps me sane.\n\nIn total I spend about four hours with them per day, which is a lot, and my hard cutoffs might be harsh, but I need them to have some me time. AITA for refusing to give in and spend every second of my free time with family?\n\nEDIT: Since people are asking, I did invite them to stay with me, but only because we discussed who should visit whom for Christmas and I told them I couldn\u2019t take off work to fly to them (it would be easier for them to come here since they WFH).", "created_utc": 1672515337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001ss8/aita_for_not_falling_for_my_moms_guilt_trip/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA for that. You don't have to change all of your plans, but dang if that's not cold. It sounds like the reason they flew out, and spent thousands of dollars of their money, was to accommodate you because you didn't want to spend yours. You also said that you wouldn't necessarily be sticking to that hard schedule, if they weren't there, and you were going to change it around for your friends, which really makes you sound like an a******. You would do it for people that you already see all the time, but people who actually took time out of their lives, and spent money to come see you don't Merit that same consideration?", "Who spends that much time gaming and out with friends when their family is visiting?

Your ratio is 13 hours of you time to 4 hours with them.\n\nIt wasn't a guilt trip, it was a sincere statement. The fact that you view any negative statement as a guilt trip says alot more about who you are as a person. \n\nAdjust your behaviors before you alienate your family. it sounds like you have a decent Mom.", "YTA - You spend 20+ hours a week playing video games. You can\u2019t cut in to that just a little to visit with your family during the holidays?", "As someone who very much can't deal with people (even family) for more than a few hours: \n\nIf you invited them, knowing how they are, you're the asshole.\nIf they invited themselves after you wouldn't go there, then you're not.", "YTA - they've flown and spent money to hang with YOU.  She didn't guilt you -  she told you her truth - and you feel it's guilt because you know you are prioritizing gaming (stop the movie?) and internet friends over live FAMILY humans being in your home.  The way you talk about the activities with them - you sound like they are forcing you to scrub floors or do taxes!!  \n\nSeems to me you are making a case for them NOT to come visit you ever again  - but maybe that's what you want.   Maybe bro will get married and she'll get a 'daughter' that appreciates her efforts and you -  well, you got discord, right?", "YTA - it\u2019s only for a few days. Just spend time with your family. You can discord and party with friends anytime when they leave.\n\nIt\u2019s not guilt tripping. She\u2019s telling you how she feels and facts. you\u2019re selfish and self absorbed.

But you don\u2019t want to alter yours even just a bit. This seems pretty lopsided to me, and I understand that your mother feels like, because you yourself are saying it here: you do not value having the family together. You\u2019d rather just do live your life as if they hadn\u2019t visited.", "YTA. Do you even want to see your family? Like why even entertain them if you didn\u2019t plan on spending more than 4hrs a day with them? Family can be exhausting, 100%. But you\u2019re literally skipping out on them to go see people you see all the time. They spent money to come see you and you\u2019re bailing at every chance.", "YTA no big deal cutting a movie off to go to your room\u2026 yeah no thats rude and selfish\n\nYou are extremely rigid and are prioritising everyone but your family and reminding them of time constrains even just occasionally is sucking the fun out of it, it shows you arent really in it with them you are checking your watch\n\nYou can suck it up for a few days to spend a little more time with them, if you dont want to spend time with them just admit it", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't a guilt trip. Your mom was stating facts and she is likely feeling hurt and disappointed. If you don't want to host family over the holidays, it is important to speak up and let them know before they make plans and spend money to travel across country to spend the holidays with you.\n\nHosting anyone, especially at the holidays, is a disruption to any schedule. It doesn't sound like you see them often given the distance. I think your mom had reasonable expectation to see you more than a few hours a day while she was in town. Take this as a lesson learned. You don't enjoy hosting so don't offer again in the future. Instead, travel to them and you can better control the length of stay and get back to your regular routine faster.", "YTA. Jesus, look at that schedule. The weekday schedule has you doing nothing with your mother and brother. Work is one thing, but you say sometimes you\u2019re doing things with your friends. The weekend had 3 hours during the day with your mom, then you went out with friends. The next day you are with friends. WTF? Are you afraid your friends will forget about you if you tell them you have plans with your family? \n\nYour mother and brother took the time to visit you. The least you can do is make quality time for them. Turning off a movie in the middle so you can play video games is so disrespectful and rude. \n\nYou are barely an adult, but maybe when you grow up, you\u2019ll realize the importance of family, especially those who make time for you. You\u2019ll also realize that the world doesn\u2019t involve around your routine and sometimes you need to accommodate others, which might mean skipping a few hours of video games.", "YTA, really and truly. Your family flies a thousand miles to spend the holidays with you for a few days and you resent they expect you to break your *routine*? Breaking routine is what holidays are for. If you are so f\\_\\_\\_ selfish that you dont want to break routine, why did you let them come? Don't you read this forum? It's endless stories of abusive parents and shitty relatives, but in this story *you* are the shitty relative.", "YTA.  Your attitude is given away in your statement \"refusing to give in and spend every second of my free time with family?\"  Is that what was asked of you?  Really?\n\nIf you don't want them around, don't have them visit.  When people visit, they are guests, and you are expected to make some sort of accommodations for them.  That you are worried about LoL or your friends' party instead of your guests makes you the A here.", "YTA, when you have guest in your home it is your job to make them feel welcome and comfortable. That is why they call hosting \u201centertaining\u201d, and also why a lot of people hate being the host. So this year maybe you learned that about yourself, you don\u2019t like and aren\u2019t good at hosting. But you still have to finish doing it for this holiday season. It\u2019s almost over. Suffer for the little time you have left with them, I\u2019d also apologize and explain that I bit off more than I could chew; that even though mom is objectively right, and the routine could be broken\u2026 I found out this Xmas that I am very comfortable in it and rely on it. \n\n\nI live alone and am single too, and could not host one family member for more than a weekend at most, let alone two of them for so long. Now you know, but finish what you started on a high note. Start the year off right.", "YTA.\n\nWhy'd you even bother to have the visit..?", "YTA. \n\nYour family wants to spend time with you, traveled across the country to do so, and you would rather hand out with friends or play video games. The fact that you aren\u2019t willing to give up a week of time and break your routine to spend with family is pretty shitty.", "YTA,", "YTA and selfish", "Trust me your friends and league of legends will still be there for you to waste 4 midnight hours on when your family leaves", "Totally YTA. Can you really not see it. Do you think you may have a gaming addiction? Genuine question", "I don't think YTA for \"not falling for my mom's guilt trip.\"  I think YTA because you're too self absorbed to feel things  like guilt, or empathy, or appreciation. It's the holidays.  It's family!  They were happy to \"break their routine\" to come spend time with you but you cannot bother to return the favor.  Lumps of coal for you.", "YTA.", "YTA they spent a lot of money and their own free time to visit you and you can\u2019t make a little more time for them? The purpose of the trip is to spend time together since it sounds like you\u2019re not able to normally. All your comments are also coming off as selfish, like all your needs and wants are more important than anything else.", "Huge YTA and a selfish one at that too. \n\nNext time just spare everyone\u2019s time, money and feelings and say **NO** they\u2019re not welcome.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nAnd incredibly rude. Just tell them to save their money and not bother trying with you anymore.", "YTA.\n\nYou invited them and then proceeded to act as if they were a burden.", "YTA \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want them to come you should have spoken up before they made the effort to come see you. And if you had spoken up like an adult nobody would fault you for declining the visit. However, the way you\u2019re choosing to treat your family is passive aggressive as f*ck and it screams that you wish they weren\u2019t there. This is immature and rude as hell. \n\nGrow up.", "YTA\n\nShe didn\u2019t guilt trip you. She respectfully expressed how she was feeling.\n\nYou are being pretty rude. It\u2019s a holiday family visit. Spend more time with your family and less time playing video games for literally one week.", "YTA: I have a low tolerance for socializing as well even with family, but you can bet your bottom dollar when my family visits from CO I make all the time in the world. I sincerely hope this is fake because there is literally\u2026.literally no excuse for inviting family, making them spend money, time, and to travel changing their entire schedule for you\u2026at your request, that you couldn\u2019t manage more than 4 hours a day in their presence. Especially since you seem to have no problem going to parties and hanging out with friends, which I can\u2019t even do because it drains my battery to nothing.", "INFO: Are you neurodivergent?", "YTA grow up and get a life with a touch of the realities about it !! \n\nYour self centered behaviour and entitlement is disturbing", "YTA. This is so rude.", "To me, it sounds like spending hours of face-to-face time with your family for 10 days straight is an overwhelming idea for you. Which, fair, that's valid. Some people have lower social limits for that kind of thing. The AH part comes from you agreeing to a visit of that length and then asking your family to travel over for your convenience. \n\nThey made some big concessions for you. Now, they're feeling resented for trying to do the things they went out of their way to do with you. That has to hurt. They can't even retreat to their own spaces in the same way you can since they're on your turf 24/7. Not only that-- they know you're not tapping out for quiet recovery time; you're choosing different people to spend at least as much time with. And those people have no time or money invested in seeing you right this moment. Probably not as much emotion invested either.\n\nI'd recommend an apology for that behavior, as well as an honest explanation this might not be a great arrangement in the future.\n\nNext year, if they do visit you, keep it for a shorter time period. Ten days is a lot if you struggle with this. Talk out what seems right, mentally commit to spending quality time, and take a day or two off from work on either end of their visit that is just for you. That'll give you time to psych up and recover. \n\nPerhaps better, if you can go to visit them, then you can step out for a walk or to hit a local attraction when you need some distance. You still need to show your mom and bro they're valued, but it's less severe than leaving them feeling stranded in your home while you have fun one room over. \n\nIn either case, try cutting down on regularly scheduled games and chats. You don't have to knock these out entirely - especially if you need a level of routine to function - but a reduction can still be meaningful. \n\nMind you, this is all assuming you do want to see them and maintain a nice relationship. If you're exhausted by your family because there's bad history and it's not healthy for you to hang around, then binding yourself to a 10-day visit really shouldn't be happening. \n\nIf that's not the case, then try for an apology this year and see if you can dedicate yourself to a (mostly) full day together before they leave.", "YTA and you should know it, but you are way too selfish and self absorbed to realize it.", "YTA. Don't be surprised if they don't want to visit in the future, because it doesn't sound like you actually enjoy hanging out with them.", "YTA.\nAnd selfish to boot.", "YTA they came to visit you.

It was such a disappointing trip, we wanted to go out and spend time with her etc, but nope. \"Grandma's in bed... again...\" \ud83d\ude44 going NC with her was the best decision I've made in a long, long time. \n\nYTA. They came to see you, to spend time with you. One day, they won't be there to spend time with and you'll miss them and their visits. Heck, they might not bother next Xmas and you won't have to worry about it!", "YTA. If you can\u2019t handle being around people, don\u2019t invite them over. It\u2019s wasting their time and money and it\u2019s rude.", "NAH. Some people'e families are a lot harder to live with than others. Do what you need to do to stay sane - but next time, communicate your intentions clearly in advance of money being spent on travel.", "Why invite them if you aren't going to spend  time with them? YTA.", "Man, I would be PISSED if I took the time off of work, paid for plane tickets, etc. to visit someone like you. Especially after YOUR invitation. If that would have been me, I would have put up with your bullshit for about two days and then got a hotel room somewhere, ghosted you and spent the rest of the time doing my own thing. If you're not willing to set aside that time for your family, then why should they waste their time with you? \"Alone time,\" \"discord\" and \"hanging with friends\" are just different ways of telling your family that they are not a priority.\n\n100% YTA.", "If you don't want to spend that much time around your family, then don't invite them into your home. YTA", "YTA. You're acting like you live with them not that they're visiting.  You're treating them like an inconvenience and spending more time with your friends that you can see any day. \nThis isn't a guilt trip, it's your mom expressing hurt that her kid doesn't care enough to be inconvenienced for a week.", "YTA \nYTA \nYTA", "YTA. You are being selfish and having an attitude.", "YTA, self absorbed and rude. It's not a routine week, and your family have completely justified feelings and expectations of the visit.", "No\u2026from 8pm-4am you spend time with your friends.  It isn\u2019t \u201cme time.\u201d  It is you telling your family F off so you can hang out with friends through a computer or whatnot (i don\u2019t know what discord is). This makes you the AH.  When people are telling you that you are blowing off your family to play games, you call it \u201cme time\u201d but truth is, that is time when you play with \u201cfriends\u201d online.  Have you ever met these people? YTA", "YTA\n\nIf you hate them so much, don't invite them.", "You invite your family to stay for the holidays, and only tell them when they arrive you have other plans for NYE, so they spend it in your home without you? \nEven without ditching them the rest of the time for people you can see any other day of the year, that would make YTA. \n\nThey have wasted over a week, plus a lot of money, coming to visit you when you can't even offer them the courtesy of spending it with them. How can you not see that is incredibly rude. You made out it was because of work/finance that you couldn't travel to them but you have proven by your actions that actually you just don't see them as worth your time.", "When the Fark are u sleeping? Also YTA.", "YTA and if I ever had a child that behaved like you, I\u2019d stop making the effort to visit.", "Why did you even have people over if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them? Don\u2019t waste their time and money next time. YTA", "Yta. Holidays with guests staying are definitely not about routine - for anyone! The rest of the year is for that. You should have cleared more of your schedule, especially as they are wfh a lot during the week so it\u2019s not like you are all forced together all the time, all week. I get it - you are still at a stage in your life when friends and your own thing feel more important than family. You should cherish them though and prioritise them more since they flew out to be with you. Not everyone is so lucky to have what you have and it\u2019s only for a week. Everyone needs some downtime btw, even guests. But it\u2019s not the same as being ditched for higher priority friends when you\u2019ve flown out to stay with someone for the holidays.", "YTA. How hard is it to spend a bit more time with your family, who are your guests. You sound selfish and its comes off as a task to spend time with them. Maybe a stupid question but are you a game addict?", "Yta, is it going to kill you to prioritize your family over your friends? Even more considering that you can see your friends anytime throughout the year and your time with your family is limited.", "Yta typical league player", "YTA. You admit that you probably wouldn\u2019t have kept that routine if they weren\u2019t around. You prefer spending time with your friends and I get, me too. However allowing them to spend money and come out to see you is unfair on them.", "YTA - tell your family next time to not waste their time on you because you don't care.", "YTA the only person coming across as obnoxious here is you! Why is your time and money more important than your mums and brothers?", "YTA. They're only visiting for a short time and it's all about spending time with them since they came all that way to see YOU. Maybe next time just don't bother.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve just told them that you didn\u2019t want to meet for the holidays. They would\u2019ve had a better time by themselves and wouldn\u2019t have spent all the \ud83d\udcb0", "YTA", "Are you sure you are actually an adult?   Yta.  Spend this time with your family.   It won\u2019t hurt you to not play games for a week.", "YTA", "I", "NTA I will tell him straight up. If this is such a problem for you maybe next year you shouldn\u2019t come.", "NTA, you have your own life and since you are an adult, shouldn\u2019t be constrained by things you don\u2019t want to do in your free time. 4 hours a day is a fair time in my opinion and I (along with other commenters) don\u2019t know how often your family visits. If this is the only time of year they visit I would say maybe spend 5 or 6 hours a day with them (even if this is true you are still not the ass) but if not your 4 hours seems perfect to me. Everyone also seems to be forgetting that you said your mom is guilt tripping you which makes me think she is the ass in this situation instantly. You also weren\u2019t openly trying to invite them over and the only reason your house was chosen was because it was the easiest. Again I say NTA\n\nLet\u2019s break it down for the people that still think you are the ass.\n24 hours are in a day minus you sleeping for 7 leaves you with 17.\nYou then work for 9 leaving you with 8 hours of free time. \nYou spend half with family and half with friends/personal activities. \nThat is very fair.", "time AND money*", "I think you have a good point. If this keeps happening when they try to spend time with OP they're basically just punishing themselves by still trying to visit with her. That said, it's understandable that that would be really upsetting to realize.", "Ditching the family who are visiting for the holidays to go to a new year party with friends, and **not telling them that until they arrive** isn't a routine that needs to be held on to. \nAll of what you say is true regarding routines in general, but OP still invited them to stay for a week. Don't do that if it is too difficult to spend time with them.", "If you don't like someone, don't invite them.", "Definitely do when I was 19 that\u2019s all my life revolved around I played an average of 6 hours a day on one game while playing others 6 out of 24 on one then 4+ hours hanging out with buddies playing different games add in a 8 hour shift and I did nothing else", "omg get a grip. You invited them and its\u2019s for a week basically. You\u2019re talking like they barged in uninvinted to freeload of of you for months. You sound exhausting, too bad they spent all that money to see you. Sorry, tried to see you.", "look i game a lot too to relax, but girl this is one week of your year. if it costs you SO MUCH to put gaming a bit aside for one *damn* week to spend time with your family that you probably rarely see, you shouldve told them you dont want to spend time with them straight on so that theyd do their own thing at their home, instead of going through all the trouble to travel to you. Yes, it was way more convenient for them to come rather than you since they didnt need to take time off, but you made them travel to mostly spend time in an empty appartment. wtf is wrong with you that you dont see the problem?", "You have the right to not invite people to your home and enjoy alone time that way. If you DO invite people to your home, you have the obligation to spend time with them, as their host.\n\nWould you invite a friend over for what you told them was a full evening, and only spend the first 1/4th with them before retreating to your room while they sat in the living room? The only difference here is that your mom and brother can't just leave and go home for the other awkward 3/4ths of the night because you invited them to travel cross country. To spend time with you.", "While you have visitors that alone time should be taken from the time you are seeing friends that you can see the rest of the year.", "Right, she told them when they arrived she wouldn't be seeing new year in with them anyway so I wouldn't have hung about for it! Rather waste more money and less time by getting an earlier flight.", "Eh, maybe a little AH, depending. Being ND doesn't completely absolve you from managing or communicating about your needs. Or accommodating others when you can. Obviously it's a case by case thing though.\n\nAlso, OP is a she.", "Ah, yes.....that was something I missed. Thank you for pointing that out. I do still stand by my comments, because I didn't say OP was definitely not an A. H. But asked that we take a beat and think of alternate reasonings.", "The only reason I wouldn't agree with this, is because Opie says that they would be fine not being rigid in their schedule for their friends, it's only for their family that they're unwilling to make that sacrifice. So it doesn't sound like the rigidity is something that is super important to them.", "Id say it\u2019s an addiction tbh when I was 19 I played \n10 hours a day and didn\u2019t see any issues with it when I stopped playing that\u2019s all I craved was to go home and play as time passed I stopped having that crave taking a year break was the best thing I could have done it has improved how I feel and made me happier since I don\u2019t just play games everyday all day. It wasn\u2019t about liking the game I was just hooked into wanting to do what YouTubers where doing in videos. Getting that rush from doing something crazy gave that rush like nothing else did.", "Just one more game then I\u2019ll be ready", "Don\u2019t worry they\u2019ll never visit you again so you don\u2019t need to worry. What a terrible host - you don\u2019t go off for hours (except for work) when you invite people to come to you.", "It will be a few years since OP didn\u2019t wanna spend time this time", "And can I just point out, what 23yo makes her mother sleep on the couch? Why didn't OP give up her bed to her mother? \n\nC'mon, OP, try acting like you care about your family.", "You're a fucking horrible human being. Ffs it gets worse with every post. Totally spoiled little brat. You don't deserve the family you got.", "You invited your family to stay with you over NYE weekend and then didn't spend NYE with them? \n\nTBH If you had these plans with your friends in advance you could have used that as the entire reason not to travel or host for the weekend. Did you ever think to warn then BEFORE they spent money and time to visit? Inviting and then abandoning them at your place for a holiday is definitely rude.", "You sound so spoiled and entitled.
