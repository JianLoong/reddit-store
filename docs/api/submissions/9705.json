My husband \"Will\" (37m) has been sleeping on the couch the whole time. He's been really awesome through the whole thing, bringing me food and cookies and Gatorade. I've had a rough go of it (despite being double boosted), so it's been really helpful. To be clear, we've been together for 5 years and married for 2. We very rarely argue, and are generally very happy and treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nWill likes to drink on Friday nights. So last night he had some beers, I'm assuming quite a few. I had been trying to fall asleep for 2 hours, but couldn't because I felt terrible. At 5:30am, Will came into the room and said he needed to sleep in his bed. I get that, because he's been on the couch for a week. But.\u00a0\n\n1. I hadn't washed the sheets or pillows and everything was probably covered in COVID.\n2. Because he hadn't been in bed (and I literally hadn't left it), a bunch of my stuff was on his side.\u00a0\n\nSo he comes in, very drunkenly saying he needs to sleep in his bed. I say \"No, there's COVID everywhere!\" and he proceeds to pull all of my stuff onto the ground, basically throwing it. This includes my pulse oximeter, my new glossybox, cough drops, cookies, water bottle, a present for my boss, etc. He then gets into bed, putting his head on a pillow I've been using all week.\u00a0\n\nI got uncharacteristically upset, and started yelling, and I threw my sweater, and picked up something he had thrown to see if it was broken, and then threw it into a pile of laundry out of anger. This is the most physical we've ever been, because generally, we don't act like this.\n\nHe sullenly went back downstairs. I checked on him to make sure he was okay, then went back to bed.\n\nThis morning, he called me from downstairs to apologize, but then he said he just \"needed to be in bed\" and because my stuff was on his side, it was \"okay\" to pull it all onto the ground. I told him that it's not acceptable behavior and not like us at all. I then told him when he realizes that it was not okay, we can talk about it. I said goodbye, and hung up.\n\nAITA? Did I overreact?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I get how COVID works. When I said \"There's covid everywhere\", it was a continuation of a joke we have had all week where he tries to kiss me and I say \"But, the covid!\" and then we both laugh. I have a history of severe respiratory illness from the flu (which happened when I was younger and healthy), so I'm very cautious with illnesses like this. You genuinely never know what can happen. I didn't want this to turn into a debate on virus transmission, I just wanted to know who acted like TA.

My back would hurt after a week on the couch too.", "No never. He's an extremely kind and loving person. That's part of what made me so upset. There have also been one or two other incidents of him drinking too much in the past year or so and being a bit belligerent.", "I agree. Thanks :)", "The gift had arrived from Amazon, and was in a container, just to address that. We had contact before I developed symptoms, but he was testing negative, so I quarantined. \n\nI do think you're right that we both sucked in this instance, but I don't think trying to keep him safe by having him sleep on the couch was \"treating him like shit\". We did that when he had it last year as well, and we've been fine all week. I have a history of serious illness, so I try to be careful with myself and the people I love.", "Not be a belligerent drunk and throw his wives things on the ground? Sounds pretty easy actually.

There was an oximeter, a gift etc on the bed that couldve been easily destroyed by throwing it and he thinks its okay. He thinks its justified to throw her things and potentially destroying them because it is \"his side\". He luckily didnt but it doesnt seem as he would care. Yes OP overreacted but if you think throwing your partners belongings is okay because its on your side..that is also asshole behaivor. \n\nI bet you wouldnt be too Happy either if your friend throws/drops your phone on purpose, even if it doesnt get destroyed", "He cleared his own spot by throwing everything on the ground and into the wall.

You're having an emotionally-driven reaction to her fairly reasonable explanation of why she felt how she did (after being woken up in the middle of the night no less).

Some folks are seeing their own behaviors listed here and trying to resolve the cognitive dissonance in the wrong direction.", "NTA!  And I don\u2019t know where some of these other posters are coming from.  Covid hits everyone differently and you seem to have had it bad. You were trying to keep your husband safe - and yes, or course, sleeping in the same bed with you is going to increase his chances of catching it! but even apart from that, you have the right to sleep alone when your sick. If this was truly a one time thing, I\u2019d let it go.  But keep an eye on how he acts when he gets drunk in the future. Throwing things on the floor like that wasn\u2019t that bad, but I hope it\u2019s not a prediction of things to come.  Also, the fact that he drinks every Friday is a little concerning- I know people who started as heavy weekend drinkers and ended up in AA four or five years later.", "Ytf do you have a pulse ox? Lol", "Esh. You were both jerks and you both should apologize.", "\u201cI then told him when he realizes it was not okay, we can talk about it.\u201d\n\nYou have a loving husband who has been nothing but helpful, literally trying to get some sleep on an actual bed, and you\u2019re worried about cookies and \u201ca present for your boss.\u201d\n\nAnd then you tell him it\u2019s completely his fault.\n\nYup.

In sickness and in health and if he\u2019s getting burnout another thing he could do that people in healthy relationships do is communicate that he needs a break. He wants to sleep in a bed instead of on the couch, communicate to find a solution that fits everyone. Getting drunk and acting like an ass solves nothing and creates more tension in the relationship.", "as a drinker and a inwardly emotional person (i internalize a lot), when things are stressful or your schedule is interrupted, drinking sometimes leads to getting wasted rather than a friday buzz to unwind and have fun. Drinking is an unhealthy emotional outlet, but it is an emotional outlet nonetheless. It doesn't seem too surprising that someone would get drunk before passing out on a couch for the 8th consecutive night- but instead turn into a belligerant jerk. I have been in his shoes and a little beer before bed helps the couch feel more inviting.\n\nOP needs an air mattress. They're way better these days than a decade ago, honestly a great temporary sleep situation since storage is so easy. and maybe convince husband to find a better emotional outlet. Go do something fun and exhausting, or something that requires a lot of focus like art/building. All the catharsis of a drinking night, all the fun, none of the risks involved. Friday bowling night or go skating or whatever. Bike ride on a trail.", "We've both acknowledged this, and apologized, and just had a cuddle.", "Finally some sanity! Way too far down the comments list for my liking", "Ah yes, a loving and helpful husband who got drunk and belligerent, come into the room in the early morning to demand to sleep in OP's contaminated sickbed (that he's not been sleeping in for his own safety) and dumped OP's possessions on the ground. \nAnd then he doesn't understand why OP was upset, and claims it's his right to dump OP' possessions on the ground?\nI think if husband doesn't see the problem in drunkenly hassling his sick wife is something to apologize for, his drinking is the least of his problems.

Like, you can almost see a switch flip in his eyes and he becomes an outright jerk. He most definitely has an alcohol problem, but he's a good person without it.
