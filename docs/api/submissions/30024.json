We had been in couples counseling to work on things. I had been feeling like I wasn\u2019t a priority and he wasn\u2019t making time for me. In counseling it was discussed how my fianc\u00e9 should try to plan more dates as this is something that made me feel appreciated and loved. He planned a fall date (pumpkin patch & apple picking) that I had been really asking to do. the day of our date his friends asked if we wanted to go out to dinner. I told my fianc\u00e9 I\u2019d be willing to make both work as I know he wanted to go to dinner with his friends and I also enjoy hanging out with his friends. He planned for us to leave for our date at 9am. The day of our date his alarm went off at 8 but didn\u2019t get up. It was 8:45 and he still wasn\u2019t up so I told myself I was going to get ready and if he wasn\u2019t ready by the time I was ready to go, I was going to go and he could meet me there. A bit of a back story is that most of the events that were important to me or something I wanted to do, he would oversleep or I would have to wake him up. This added to the mental load for myself and this time I was just so frustrated because he knew how important this was for me. It was 9:40 and I was ready to go and he was still sleeping. As I was just about to walk out of the house he gets up and I tell him that I\u2019m going and he can meet me there. This turned into a huge argument and him calling me manipulative for not waking him up.

Is it safe to assume that he's raring to go if it's something he wants to do?", "Nope,\u2018definitely NTA and he\u2019s still not prioritizing you. He\u2019s going through the motions to look good and feel good about himself, but it doesn\u2019t seem genuine if he can\u2019t even get his ass out of bed himself! \n\nHe\u2019s an adult and you\u2019re not his mother!", "Ask him to explain what actions you have taken that are manipulative by not waking him?", "NTA. If he can wake himself up for things important to him, he can wake himself up for things important to you. It shows how he doesn't prioritize you, AND expects you to mommy him. He's not going to change for you. He will only change if he wants to.", "NTA. You could have just waken him up, sure, but the whole point is that it's a pattern. He sounds like he wants a mom, not a significant other.", "And what would happen if you did the same for something you\u2019d planned to do together, but he actually wanted to go to? Would he sleep in then? I\u2019m guessing not.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't sound like he's much fun for you to live with up be honest.", "Nta and it's time to end couples counseling.

If you had woke him to remind him of the date he may have sprung up.\n\nI don't think it was manipulative of you, but I do think that if planning dates is something he agreed to work on, then planned a date he is obviouslytrying at least a little, I don't think it's unreasonable to wake him or prompt him when snoozing alarm to remind him.\n\nI don't think yta though, just that navigating your challenges together isn't going too smooth just yet but remember that couples counselling will take participation and grace from both of you to make progress together. You can support each other in learning new ways to navigate your relationship", "I'm honestly shocked that the mention of couples counseling and someone sleeping in can have an army of people developing their own context for and making assumptions and telling someone to get out of a relationship instead of focusing on a more specific instance.\n\nSo I'm going to just forget the entire question of whether anyone is an asshole\n\nYou are in couples counseling, you are making an effort, is it worth it?  that's for you to decide.  He is going with you, so he is also making that effort.  \n\nIf you want to sum up him sleeping in and not waking up as him not appreciating you, that's your decision, but honestly if you've woken him up so many times before, why put your foot down on a day that he has planned for you, where he might have started off poorly but may have surprised you later.  \n\nI'm not saying he would have, I don't know you, I don't know him, and for all I know you just aren't compatible with each other. \n\nBut I'm going to assume that him sleeping in isn't the root of why you don't feel appreciated, obviously it's part of it considering that is what this is about.  But who knows how the day could have actually gone if you both went together.  Maybe it would have gone great, maybe it would have gone terrible, but either the date ended in the morning or the morning spoiled it.", "NTA, but going to couples counseling with a fiance is stupid. If the relationship isn't good now, it isn't going to be better 20 years from now. Break up and find someone who's a better fit.", "NTA. Why should you take responsibility for waking him up for an important outing? It sounds like he's not making much of an effort at all. Is he angry with you for not taking you all of the responsibility for the health of your relationship? I would definitely raise this in couples' counseling.", "This would be a good time to consider what you want your future to look like. If you were to have children with this person, would it just involve you having to get EVERYONE up and ready for the day? You're not his mother and you don't have to be. Use this as an example of what you DON'T want in a relationship.", "It does seem passive aggressive of him. So, next time I'd just tell him in advance, \"I'll just go and do my own thing rather than play these silly games with you.\"\n\nBut, NTA. I would want to wait around for my guy to get his snit together either.", "YTA in this case. If it was so important to you then you would have done it. It wasn't important to either of you, so you went alone.", "ESH. He should be able to wake up for a plan and you should just wake him up if he's supposed to be awake instead of whatever it was you were trying to do.

I sleep through my alarms all the time, adult or not. If you had plans you should\u2019ve woke him up", "So he stays up gaming until 2-3am. Yes this is an issue and i do it as well. BUT he clearly doesnt get a full nights rest. The best solution would to plan around his sleep schedule and go around noon so he is well rested OR tell him he has to go to bed early as you guys have important plans. If he almost always stays up all night, its very hard to \u201cwake up\u201d when your own body is fighting you to go back to sleep.", "Bring it up in therapy, not Reddit.", "YTA, I mean you could have just waken him up, you live together.........", "Soft NAH, I understand how OP would see someone oversleeping as them not caring or making an effort, but also as someone who really struggles to wake up and knows the shameful feeling of oversleeping and disappointing others, sometimes people can't control their ability to wake up.", "YTA it\u2019s petty to not just wait for him. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s reservations for a PUMPKIN PATCH.

Let me guess, you love drama", "Lmao YTA just break up with him so he can have peace. The one person thats supposed to bring a man peace is bringing the biggest drama just coz the man is SLEEPING. Just wake him up but no you choose to be a drama queen. Just give him peace and break up with him please he deserves better.", "NTA - you are neither his mother nor his alarm clock\nI have a rule that I do not wake people up, no exceptions because people can be real AHs about it and that's why alarms exist.", "NTA but see the writing on the wall here. He isn\u2019t a good match for you. He doesn\u2019t care about things that are important to you. He doesn\u2019t prioritize your happiness. Let this \u201cman\u201d go and find someone who is excited to do things with you. He isn\u2019t worth what you are going through while trying to make it work. I have a boyfriend who often stays up gaming but I have never felt neglected or not a priority. He checks with me before he starts gaming. He takes breaks between games to come say hi and ask about what I am doing or tell me a funny story about his games. He tells his boys \u201cok this is the last one cause I want to get off and spend time with gf\u201d or have to be up early tomorrow. That\u2019s how an adult does thing. Your guy is just a kid in a man\u2019s body. Your guy just doesn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t want to put his effort into you. He doesn\u2019t want to have to think about your needs or wants. Therapy won\u2019t make him want to do these things. Find a guy who wants to make you happy.", "NTA\n\n\nBut YTA to yourself if you don't end it. You're telling him you don't feel valued,bits coming up on therapy. You're telling him how to make you feel valued and he's not making the effort. But trying to fit in seeing his friends?\n\nYou're not a priority. And you deserve to be when you're in a relationship.\n\nI don't use the word deserve lightly, because I don't think we deserve anything really. The world doesn't owe us.

So much this.   This will be your life going forward if you marry him.   Cut your losses and get out now, before it becomes a very expensive divorce and custody battle. \n\nNTA", "So, he wants you to act like you're his mom?", "I Wonder how he would have hopped out of bed had you scheduled breakfast with his friends for 9am, and the activities you care about afterwards\u2026", "GTFO of this relationship like yesterday", "You\u2019re NTA. This is how my first marriage ended in divorce. I became a mother to him. In counseling I discussed hating having to wake him up (multiple times each day) for work, church, family events, etc. The therapist knew my dad\u2019s birthday was over the weekend and sadly set a goal for a 33 year old man to get up on his own and to be ready on time. Needless to say, he did not and I left to make the 3 hour drive back home for my dad\u2019s birthday on time but alone. He called me 2 hours into the drive asking me to turn around and that he was up. I did not and it was in that moment I started to disconnect from him. I tried another few months after this to make the marriage work. \n\nLong story short, if this guy can\u2019t even get his ass up and out of bed then don\u2019t waste your time being in this relationship any further. He\u2019s not capable of change and this time and you shouldn\u2019t waste your time.", "I agree! I'm so paranoid about missing a flight that I set 5 alarms.

Humans aren't always perfect for each other, and couples counselling can help couples learn how to be better together. \n\nBut if he isn't making the effort to change even after learning how much it bothers you, then he isn't trying, and yes, you should probably break up at that stage.", "This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. Why should OP have to be his mother and fianc\u00e9e?", "Been an issue in the past and I have brought it up before.

OP wanted to see what would happen if she didn\u2019t \u201cnag\u201d him about their date. Is it really a date if one person has to pressure the other person into going?\n\nI am assuming he doesn\u2019t miss engagements with his friends or with work. This was a choice that he made not to prioritize their date. Personally if I have to berate my partner into taking me out, I no longer want to go out. I am SURE op would not mind a simple wake-up occasionally if this was not a pattern. But at this point I don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting to wake up their partner, drag them out of bed and beg for attention that was already scheduled", "I didn\u2019t want him to mess up, trust me, I wanted nothing more than a great day with him but I also don\u2019t want to have to be the one to make sure he\u2019s ready in time, especially after all the work I had done around the house, with our animals, and for him.

I\u2019m assuming this guy manages to scrape himself out of bed to get to work on time and for activities that are important to him, so his gf shouldn\u2019t have to force him out of bed for activities that are important to her. Planning an event doesn\u2019t mean much if you don\u2019t actually participate in the event as planned (which meant waking up to leave at 9am).", "Temporarily.
