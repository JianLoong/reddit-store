Also, for the past \\~6 months, Sam and I have started regularly hitting the gym. Unfortunately, Sam has recently developed an annoying jokester side and his fitness-related jokes have started to ruin our friendship. \r  \n\r  \nWhat are the jokes, you may ask? For example, he started calling me anorexic a few months into our gym journey. I've been on the slimmer side for as long as I can remember, and being a tall late bloomer, it's naturally hard for me to put on weight (and Sam knows this). \n\nSo when Sam started calling me anorexic, I was simply offended and on the verge of angry tears. I was trying to improve myself only for him to randomly get under my skin, thinking it was remotely funny. I would try changing the topic and expressing my frustration each time but Sam persisted with his jokes to the point where I'd ignore him entirely some days (something I've never done before). Eventually, I guess Sam got the hint because he stopped making the same non-stop joke about my stature and I thought that was the end of it. \r  \n\r  \nWell, I was wrong. As of late, Sam has developed a new phrase to use as his form of banter, where he will call me lazy if I miss a gym session, and then proceed to call me anorexic and say I need the gym more than him if I try to retaliate. \n\nThe tipping point was when I went on a trip and got a text from Sam. Instead of asking me how my trip was, Sam made fun of me for not being in the gym for the week I was away. Then when I told him about starting my summer job in a few weeks, he jokingly called me lazy for not already working like he was. Honestly, I reached my breaking point and told him to just shut up and muted messaging notifications from him, and proceeded to ignore the texts that ensued. \n\nThat break from our friendship felt like a breath of fresh air but I feel like I might have overreacted given our friendship used to be great. Yet, I've been a punching bag for the past 6 months and I've started developing an unhealthy contempt for my body I never had before. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for abruptly reducing my contact with my best friend and considering going down to NC?", "created_utc": 1686964038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bdclv/aita_for_ignoring_my_best_friend_over_his_jokes/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cut him out.", "NTA - The reality is that making comments about someone's body in general is out of line.  I've heard, \"Don't comment on something someone can't change in fifteen minutes.\"  It is always healthiest to try to be honest with your friends before it reaches this point.  That said, it sounds as though the resentment really built.  A break was probably in your best interest.  It also sounds, though, as though this relationship was really important to you for a really long time.  If it is something you want to save, it's time to sit down, have a candid conversation, and set some healthy boundaries about the comments he's made.  If he's truly a great friend, he's going to WANT to have this conversation with you and repair things.", "NTA - He's being a bully. Jokes about people's bodies aren't funny to begin with. But continuing them and even getting worse about it after being told how much they are hurting is not okay. \n\nSomething tells me he may be projecting his own insecurities since this really only seemed to begin when yall started working out, but obviously I can't say for certain.\n\nBut yeah, he's being hurtful, you've told him, and he has only continued the behavior. Beginning to cut him out of your life is perfectly valid. I totally get that it can be hard. I had to do so recently with someone I'd been best friends with for over fifteen years. Since middle school. It was hard because I'd look past the hurtful present to look at the happy past. But you gotta protect present you. I wish you the strength you need and hope the hurt doesn't last too long.", "NTA - Your \"friend\" is a bully. If you don't want to end the friendship, set some boundaries but definitely stop going to the gym with him. Going to the gym means physically and mentally investing your time and energy on yourself and your friends comment will not let you achieve that. You can try going at a different time or location. \n\nI am sorry that you had to deal with that and I am proud of you for hitting the gym & taking care of yourself", "1000% NTA. Honestly, those \"jokes\" are so not appropriate in the first place. And you repeatedly communicated your discomfort and Sam repeatedly ignored your needs. I'm going to say that ending this friendship might just be the best thing for you because it doesn't sound very healthy to me.", "NTA\n\nAnorexia is no joke.  Being slim is no joke.   Skinny shaming is on the same level as fat shaming and neither should be acceptable.\n\nIt sounds like the friendship has finished, and please don't feel guilty about walking away from this friendship, all friendships have a time and place and we just naturally outgrown people.  \n\nAnd the feeling of a breath of fresh air is a good indication that you need to move on.  Either go to the gym at a different time to him, or change gyms, or if you are so inclined - stop going all together.", "You don't need him, or his comments. Maybe it's just insecurity on his part - but nothing about those are \"funny\". And they can be incredibly damaging to people. Drop him. You can reassess if/when he grows up.", "NTA. This is no longer a friendship, this is you being used as a verbal and mental punching bag for a \u201cfriend\u201d because your muscle development is slower than his. He\u2019s turned your health journey into a toxic subject, has made you second guess things, and has made you think negatively toward yourself. Clearly the time away was good and it shows that you\u2019re better off without him. \n\nRemember, life is like a storybook. Some people will be in every chapter until the end, while others only make guest appearances before you move on to the next book. Don\u2019t keep someone around who will only give you writers block.", "NTA but stand up for yourself.\n\n\"Anorexia isn't something to lightly joke about and I'm fed up of you saying it. I don't really want a friend who will use me for poor humor. I have ignored it for this long because I valued our friendship, but if this continues, you'll have to find someone else to go the gym with you.\"", "NTA - while this is a bullying behavior you are missing the possibility of telling Sam the AH here how you feel.  While this may be uncomfortable it could be a needed lesson for him about appropriate jokes vs bullying.  If no change cut him off.", "ESH: His \"banter\" sounds like jealousy and it's a real problem. It's not encouraging and counter-productive. But you should stick up for yourself.

You will learn throughout your life that sometimes, some friends just grow apart. Whether it\u2019s from forming different interests, disrespect, distance. It just happens.

He needs to lay off whatever supplements he's taking to cool his testosterone and to help him see that how he's treating his friend is making him come off like some high school movie bully.

We sat down, talked things out, and agreed that I'd be more candid with my feelings in the future and he would be more cautious about his part of things.

You're not abandoning the ship, you're just moving onto another one which is taking you in a different direction.", "Speaking from experience, I get it. It's so easy to get used to just letting a \"friend\" treat you poorly and to just let it go because you've invested time in a friendship and you feel you owe them some loyalty for the good times in the past.\n\nI wish someone had told me when I was younger to stand up for myself and not just allow someone to put me down to make themselves feel good. \n\nIf you don't put your foot down now, you'll just keep allowing this behaviour to go on, sinking time and energy into a relationship that is making you feel worse.", "You're right, it's just how quickly these \"jokes\" have begun that are tripping me up.

Also remember that you can't do everything with your best friend. Set a boundary and stop working out with him - go to a different location or at a different time. If this friend continues to bully you in other aspects of your life, then you know. You've been friends for this long for a reason. Hope you can find a more peaceful gym routine and a way to preserve the good parts of this friendship.", "I agree with the person saying it\u2019s not just easy to walk away. You are being too harsh, when someone randomly changes into an asshole it can be a shock for a lot of people and they aren\u2019t going to immediately jump to dropping someone they\u2019ve known for a long time. Human relationships are more nuanced and complicated than that. Yea of course he needs to stand up for himself, that isn\u2019t debatable, but your comment is overly harsh and gives the picture of blaming him when he\u2019s literally just an 18 year old kid who is shocked by his friend\u2019s sudden change in behavior.", "I'll have a chat with him and I hope it goes the same way it did for you. I'll wait until I see him in person again and have a calm discussion. If it helps, great, if not then I know what to do. Thank you and I hope you're still close with that friend", "He resents you for some reason, most likely. He might be insulting your body because he's jealous, or he's negging you because he's insecure over something else. You could try to ask him point blank why he's making these comments.\n\nLike: hey, you've been making these comments about my body really frequently. Don't tell me they're jokes, because they're not funny, and you won't stop despite me asking you. Do you want to tell me why you're being deliberately unkind to me because I'm ready to end our friendship over your behavior. \n\nIf he tries to reverse things and make himself the victim, leave. \n\nIf he tries to say you're too sensitive, leave.\n\nBasically, if he does anything other than apologize, you should move on.\n\nUnfortunately, friendships can often have an expiration date, just like romantic relationships, and it can be hard to step away. But it's just going to eat away at you to remain friends with someone who can't treat you with basic respect.", "You could call it a sudden change six months ago. Now?
