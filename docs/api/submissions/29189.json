We currently live in a very nice place. I bought this house from my uncle before we started dating, and my parents paid for most of it. We are close to virtually everything important, like two multi-speciality hospitals, schools, colleges, malls, theatres, and subways, which are literally a maximum of 15 minutes away from our house. As you can see from my description, we don't need a new house, but my wife thinks the problem is that there are too many old people here.\n\nMy wife told me that she feels old here because there are so many old people living around us. Most of the people here are rich 40- to 50-year old couples who have retired to find some peace. I don't mind because when I first shifted here, our neighbours literally treated me like their son, so I really don't want to leave this place.\n\nTwo years after our marriage, my wife insisted I buy a new house. I refused because her idea was to sell this house and buy a new one. I told her that I wasn't going to sell this place at any cost. She must've seen how firm I was and didn't bring up the subject again, but after our daughter was born, she said we should at least save money for the future; her primary idea was to still move to the centre of the city. I realised that she didn't move on from wanting a new house, but it's not bad to save money, so I agreed.\n\nIt is worth noting to her that we both work, but my salary is a little more than double hers. So I have made the major contribution to that saving. A couple of days ago, my friend asked for some money. I didn't have that much on me, so I lent him from our \"savings\". I told my wife after I reached home. She got so angry and asked why I lent him money from the savings. I told her the reason, but she was still pissed. She said, How can I trust someone blindly if he doesn't return the money? I said I knew him way longer than her; we literally went to school together, and his entire family, even his cousins, knew me. She then said, Why didn't I ask her first? I said that it wouldn't have made any difference because I contributed the most and we are not in need of a new house immediately, so I would've still lent him money. She started crying and went to our room. She's not talked to me since.

Your family basically ensures that you and your wife have it easy.\n\nThe only thing I will say is this; money is kinda relative because if I wanted to lend money to my best friend or family; I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it, I would easily give them probably up to $5,000 and tell my wife as an fyi.

It would be ridiculous to think that she\u2019s automatically entitled to half of it just because you are married. (Obviously I know in divorce a lot of people end up screwing over the other partner, taking half or more of what they own, which is also ridiculous) and yes you should\u2019ve told her or talk to her about it. But if it doesn\u2019t hurt your family financially and it was your money that you made yourself then I don\u2019t get the big deal about letting a friend borrow.

We currently live in a very nice place. I bought this house from my uncle before we started dating, and my parents paid for most of it. We are close to virtually everything important, like two multi-speciality hospitals, schools, colleges, malls, theatres, and subways, which are literally a maximum of 15 minutes away from our house. As you can see from my description, we don't need a new house, but my wife thinks the problem is that there are too many old people here.\n\nMy wife told me that she feels old here because there are so many old people living around us. Most of the people here are rich 40- to 50-year old couples who have retired to find some peace. I don't mind because when I first shifted here, our neighbours literally treated me like their son, so I really don't want to leave this place.\n\nTwo years after our marriage, my wife insisted I buy a new house. I refused because her idea was to sell this house and buy a new one. I told her that I wasn't going to sell this place at any cost. She must've seen how firm I was and didn't bring up the subject again, but after our daughter was born, she said we should at least save money for the future; her primary idea was to still move to the centre of the city. I realised that she didn't move on from wanting a new house, but it's not bad to save money, so I agreed.\n\nIt is worth noting to her that we both work, but my salary is a little more than double hers. So I have made the major contribution to that saving. A couple of days ago, my friend asked for some money. I didn't have that much on me, so I lent him from our \"savings\". I told my wife after I reached home. She got so angry and asked why I lent him money from the savings. I told her the reason, but she was still pissed. She said, How can I trust someone blindly if he doesn't return the money? I said I knew him way longer than her; we literally went to school together, and his entire family, even his cousins, knew me. She then said, Why didn't I ask her first? I said that it wouldn't have made any difference because I contributed the most and we are not in need of a new house immediately, so I would've still lent him money. She started crying and went to our room. She's not talked to me since. I know I might've said some rude things, but I don't think I am TA here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This whole thought process is so weird to me. My husband and I share an account. One of us makes slightly more than the other but it's not a competition when it comes to deciding money being spent. She's your partner. Regardless. You should always converse with her when it comes to things like this. Major decisions need to be made together. If you can't come to an agreement then no action should be taken by either of you.", "Yta- from your family.

She worked as hard as you did to save, so the fact that you make more is irrelevant.

Like in this instance using it against her that you contribute more financially than she does.

A lot of people are married with separate finances and thats totally fine as long as they are transparent and in agreement about it.\n\nAlso about your living situation - her happiness should really matter to you.

She deserves a partner who values her and doesn't diminish what she wants because she didn't pay for the house and doesn't make as much money as you. Whether you understand it or not, you aren't treating her like a partner and she deserves better. So if you love and value her - do better.
