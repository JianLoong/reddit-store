We currently live in a very nice place. I bought this house from my uncle before we started dating, and my parents paid for most of it. We are close to virtually everything important, like two multi-speciality hospitals, schools, colleges, malls, theatres, and subways, which are literally a maximum of 15 minutes away from our house. As you can see from my description, we don't need a new house, but my wife thinks the problem is that there are too many old people here.\n\nMy wife told me that she feels old here because there are so many old people living around us. Most of the people here are rich 40- to 50-year old couples who have retired to find some peace. I don't mind because when I first shifted here, our neighbours literally treated me like their son, so I really don't want to leave this place.\n\nTwo years after our marriage, my wife insisted I buy a new house. I refused because her idea was to sell this house and buy a new one. I told her that I wasn't going to sell this place at any cost. She must've seen how firm I was and didn't bring up the subject again, but after our daughter was born, she said we should at least save money for the future; her primary idea was to still move to the centre of the city. I realised that she didn't move on from wanting a new house, but it's not bad to save money, so I agreed.\n\nIt is worth noting to her that we both work, but my salary is a little more than double hers. So I have made the major contribution to that saving. A couple of days ago, my friend asked for some money. I didn't have that much on me, so I lent him from our \"savings\". I told my wife after I reached home. She got so angry and asked why I lent him money from the savings. I told her the reason, but she was still pissed. She said, How can I trust someone blindly if he doesn't return the money? I said I knew him way longer than her; we literally went to school together, and his entire family, even his cousins, knew me. She then said, Why didn't I ask her first? I said that it wouldn't have made any difference because I contributed the most and we are not in need of a new house immediately, so I would've still lent him money. She started crying and went to our room. She's not talked to me since.

We currently live in a very nice place. I bought this house from my uncle before we started dating, and my parents paid for most of it. We are close to virtually everything important, like two multi-speciality hospitals, schools, colleges, malls, theatres, and subways, which are literally a maximum of 15 minutes away from our house. As you can see from my description, we don't need a new house, but my wife thinks the problem is that there are too many old people here.\n\nMy wife told me that she feels old here because there are so many old people living around us. Most of the people here are rich 40- to 50-year old couples who have retired to find some peace. I don't mind because when I first shifted here, our neighbours literally treated me like their son, so I really don't want to leave this place.\n\nTwo years after our marriage, my wife insisted I buy a new house. I refused because her idea was to sell this house and buy a new one. I told her that I wasn't going to sell this place at any cost. She must've seen how firm I was and didn't bring up the subject again, but after our daughter was born, she said we should at least save money for the future; her primary idea was to still move to the centre of the city. I realised that she didn't move on from wanting a new house, but it's not bad to save money, so I agreed.\n\nIt is worth noting to her that we both work, but my salary is a little more than double hers. So I have made the major contribution to that saving. A couple of days ago, my friend asked for some money. I didn't have that much on me, so I lent him from our \"savings\". I told my wife after I reached home. She got so angry and asked why I lent him money from the savings. I told her the reason, but she was still pissed. She said, How can I trust someone blindly if he doesn't return the money? I said I knew him way longer than her; we literally went to school together, and his entire family, even his cousins, knew me. She then said, Why didn't I ask her first? I said that it wouldn't have made any difference because I contributed the most and we are not in need of a new house immediately, so I would've still lent him money. She started crying and went to our room. She's not talked to me since. I know I might've said some rude things, but I don't think I am TA here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This whole thought process is so weird to me. My husband and I share an account. One of us makes slightly more than the other but it's not a competition when it comes to deciding money being spent. She's your partner. Regardless. You should always converse with her when it comes to things like this. Major decisions need to be made together.

She worked as hard as you did to save, so the fact that you make more is irrelevant.
