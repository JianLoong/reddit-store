I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn\u2019t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let\u2019s call her Vivian.\n\nLater during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. \n\nThat\u2019s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. \n\nWell my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn\u2019t know we had kept in touch, but he didn\u2019t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can\u2019t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don\u2019t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don\u2019t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I\u2019m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I\u2019m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I\u2019m  not a home-wrecker and I\u2019m straight anyway.\n\nAnyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn\u2019t get to tell me what to do, that I\u2019m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. \nNow, I\u2019m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I\u2019m creating unnecessary drama. AITA?\n\nEdit: \n\n1.I told my friends in the group chat (Vivian it's not in the Group chat, just FB and IG) and they all agreed this is a red flag. We are creating a Discord to talk to her.\n\n2. I don't think she has blocked me yet, since today she sent me a message asking me what I thought about the cookies. \n", "created_utc": 1699995125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vbwag/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_i_wont_block_his/", "score": 742, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

More so, he tries to force you to cut off a contact, so that Vivian doesn't even know it was his idea and feels resentful towards you... \n\nHe's walking red flag and Vivian may need help in the future.", "NTA. I would be worried about Vivian and how controlling he is. Please keep her in your circle and check on her. His behavior is strange at the very least and could turn concerning.", "So this guy leaves his wife at a concert, then tells you to block her on your social media and not to talk to her again.  I don't get it, he's such a creep.  It sounds like he's trying to control his wife's to some degree, but then why leave her at a concert?  I mean how was she to get home?  He's weird....something isn't right with him, just can't figure it out.  NTA  I would have said worse.", "NTA. It seems like he\u2019s controlling and isolates her; so running into you at the \ud83d\udc9cconcert movie\ud83d\udc9c and you being kind to his wife is throwing off his game. If he\u2019s got her alone, he\u2019s got all the power. You may not even be talking about their marriage or how he treats her; he will see anyone was a threat to his power over her.", "NTA. What a bizarre thing to ask you to do! If he has an issue with his wife's social media habits he should take it up with her, as you said - but this is so weirdly controlling that I'm a little worried that he's trying to isolate her. Could be he just doesn't want to mix work and home life to avoid any personal drama at work, but in that case, why bring drama into work by asking you to block her instead of vice versa?\n\nI hope you can keep in touch with her, in case she needs a friend!", "NTA but be careful. He sounds controlling and may be trying to alienate his wife from any outsiders. That's a sign of possible abuse imo. Honestly who you or Vivian are friends with isn't any of his business and that's disturbingly controlling.", "NTA\n\n36 year old dude being overly protective and manipulative toward his young 20s gf and acting like a complete ass leaving her at the concert alone? Probably sounds like he is terrified that some competent women in their late 20s/early30s are going to talk some sense into her and he wants to stop that as quick as possible so he can continue having control. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. However, I recommend looking out for Vivian a bit, she's not in the healthiest of relationships.", "NTA. You made a new friend in Vivien, congratulations! Your coworker is sending off serious red flags by first leaving her at the concert and second asking you to block her. What a strange request!", "NTA - If he literally said \u201cblock my wife on social and never speak to her again\u201d he is both an AH and a psycho.   That said, if he was a bit more diplomatic than that, you should have asked him why.  \n\nObviously he doesn\u2019t get to tell you (or his wife) who they can be friends with, but instead of telling him off, you could have investigated his reasoning.  Maybe there is some weird circumstance whereby his request would make sense.  Or more likely, you get confirmation that he\u2019s just a controlling AH.", "NTA. He\u2019s afraid you might realize what a controlling AH he is and help her get away from him.", "That is red flag for Vivian. \n\nHe leaves her at a movie theater. \n\nHe tries to isolate her from making friends? \n\nWOW.\n\nNTA\n\nyour coworker sure is", "NTA\n\nYou two hit it off.  No need for him to be a grumpy guss.  My bet is he doesn't want his wife to \"accidentally\" find out through you when he surreptitiously takes a day off work to go gambling or pick up a sex worker.  Or, like what happened at my work, he's been hiding quarterly safety bonus checks that she never new about to get himself some toys, or to gamble  with, or to pick up a sex worker.", "NTA. This might be a red flag for some type of abuse - the age gap, his dismissal of the things she likes, him trying to alienate her from a new acquaintance. I would not block her, and in fact might even give her a way to contact me in the case he takes her phone, etc.", "NTA - Your coworker can't control who you interact with on social media. Blocking someone just because he told you to would be unreasonable. It's important to set boundaries and not let others dictate your relationships.", "NTA.

Totally correct response.", "NTA OP and keep looking out for Vivian. Do not listen to him and this bloke is bad news", "NTA- I would tell his wife what he said.\n\nHe sounds dismissive of her and controlling. Who leaves his girl on the middle of a concert because they were bored. \nAnd no he wants to stop her from having friends ?\n\nThe age gap gives me the \u201cI don\u2019t want an older woman to show my wife that she can stand up for herself\u201d vibe.", "NTA your response was appropriate. He sounds problematic and his wife may need your friendship more than you realized.", "NTA - he\u2019s a control freak. Stay in contact, she might needs friends later.", "NTA. That poor woman is being isolated be her husband. Maybe he just thinks it's awkward because you're his coworker but he's a big boy and needs to get over that. At worst he's trying to control who she communicates with.

I think your tone with him was right.", "NTA\n\n>but he didn\u2019t like it\n\nHere's the response: Why?\n\nHe has to justify it before you can decide that he gets to police your social media.\n\nI doubt there's a justification for it, but I'd be curious to know what BS he's willing to fling your way.", "NTA Keep talking to her, she needs someone in her corner.", "NTA.  Thank you for being a kind person and befriending this woman who was left alone at an event she was supposed to enjoy with her husband.  \n\nI'm with most other commenters that his behavior sounds controlling and I wonder what else is going on in her relationship with him.

Not to mention she made the cookies, replied, and clearly seems interested in a friendship with you. As someone who was manipulated and triangulated in an abusive situation for two years by someone similar, not only are you not the asshole, but she is definitely in danger staying with him.

And how were they?", "Nta. I think it\u2019s totally ok for him to be uncomfortable with his wife reaching out to you\u2026but that\u2019s a conversation he needs to have with his wife and not you. Purely on the side of preserving your mental health you might want to put some distance between yourself/your career and whatever they have going on in their relationship though.", "NTA but just to give the flip side of what everyone here is going with, maybe vivian overshares on socials & he wants to keep his personal life separate from work", "* \n\n* update \n I didnt see that OP was a woman. Thank you guys for pointing that out. Disregard this comment below  because in that case you're NTA \n\nYTA. You are communicating with his wife and commeting on her social media and he of course has a problem with it. Regardless of whether he left her at rhe concert if he's asked you to cut communication with HIS wife then you absolutely should respect that. You're not in love with her so the only things that happening is your causing problems in your friendship with him and in their own relationship. If you weren't commenting on her stuff and she wasn't reaching out to you via messages this would be different,  but the fact you flat out refused is a huge red flag and he most likely will assume that you and her have something else going on . You may not be cheating with her but you are causing problems in a relationship and that's not ok. You went from being tagged in group things to having private conversations and that's a boundary most relationships don't cross.", "Very soft YTA here just because this guy sounds abusive (if that's how he talks to a coworker at work,just imagine how he is at home) and the one who might end up enduring the backlash is Vivian. My guess is that, as usual in these situations, he's been keeping her isolated to maintain control and you becoming her friend threatens that. If you have a way to slip a discreet msg to her, please see if you can agree on some sort of password to request help.

That and the fact that he just abandoned his wife at the movie makes him seem like a massive, controlling asshole.
