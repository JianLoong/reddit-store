I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn\u2019t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let\u2019s call her Vivian.\n\nLater during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. \n\nThat\u2019s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. \n\nWell my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn\u2019t know we had kept in touch, but he didn\u2019t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can\u2019t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don\u2019t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don\u2019t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I\u2019m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I\u2019m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I\u2019m  not a home-wrecker and I\u2019m straight anyway.\n\nAnyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn\u2019t get to tell me what to do, that I\u2019m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. \nNow, I\u2019m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I\u2019m creating unnecessary drama.

More so, he tries to force you to cut off a contact, so that Vivian doesn't even know it was his idea and feels resentful towards you... \n\nHe's walking red flag and Vivian may need help in the future.", "NTA. I would be worried about Vivian and how controlling he is. Please keep her in your circle and check on her. His behavior is strange at the very least and could turn concerning.", "So this guy leaves his wife at a concert, then tells you to block her on your social media and not to talk to her again.  I don't get it, he's such a creep.  It sounds like he's trying to control his wife's to some degree, but then why leave her at a concert?  I mean how was she to get home?  He's weird....something isn't right with him, just can't figure it out.  NTA  I would have said worse.", "NTA. It seems like he\u2019s controlling and isolates her; so running into you at the \ud83d\udc9cconcert movie\ud83d\udc9c and you being kind to his wife is throwing off his game. If he\u2019s got her alone, he\u2019s got all the power. You may not even be talking about their marriage or how he treats her; he will see anyone was a threat to his power over her.", "NTA. What a bizarre thing to ask you to do! If he has an issue with his wife's social media habits he should take it up with her, as you said - but this is so weirdly controlling that I'm a little worried that he's trying to isolate her. Could be he just doesn't want to mix work and home life to avoid any personal drama at work, but in that case, why bring drama into work by asking you to block her instead of vice versa?\n\nI hope you can keep in touch with her, in case she needs a friend!", "NTA but be careful. He sounds controlling and may be trying to alienate his wife from any outsiders. That's a sign of possible abuse imo. Honestly who you or Vivian are friends with isn't any of his business and that's disturbingly controlling.", "NTA\n\n36 year old dude being overly protective and manipulative toward his young 20s gf and acting like a complete ass leaving her at the concert alone? Probably sounds like he is terrified that some competent women in their late 20s/early30s are going to talk some sense into her and he wants to stop that as quick as possible so he can continue having control. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. However, I recommend looking out for Vivian a bit, she's not in the healthiest of relationships.", "NTA. You made a new friend in Vivien, congratulations! Your coworker is sending off serious red flags by first leaving her at the concert and second asking you to block her. What a strange request!", "NTA - If he literally said \u201cblock my wife on social and never speak to her again\u201d he is both an AH and a psycho.   That said, if he was a bit more diplomatic than that, you should have asked him why.  \n\nObviously he doesn\u2019t get to tell you (or his wife) who they can be friends with, but instead of telling him off, you could have investigated his reasoning.  Maybe there is some weird circumstance whereby his request would make sense.  Or more likely, you get confirmation that he\u2019s just a controlling AH.", "NTA. He\u2019s afraid you might realize what a controlling AH he is and help her get away from him.", "That is red flag for Vivian. \n\nHe leaves her at a movie theater. \n\nHe tries to isolate her from making friends? \n\nWOW.\n\nNTA\n\nyour coworker sure is", "NTA\n\nYou two hit it off.  No need for him to be a grumpy guss.  My bet is he doesn't want his wife to \"accidentally\" find out through you when he surreptitiously takes a day off work to go gambling or pick up a sex worker.  Or, like what happened at my work, he's been hiding quarterly safety bonus checks that she never new about to get himself some toys, or to gamble  with, or to pick up a sex worker.", "NTA. This might be a red flag for some type of abuse - the age gap, his dismissal of the things she likes, him trying to alienate her from a new acquaintance. I would not block her, and in fact might even give her a way to contact me in the case he takes her phone, etc.", "NTA - Your coworker can't control who you interact with on social media.

He sounds problematic and his wife may need your friendship more than you realized.", "NTA - he\u2019s a control freak. Stay in contact, she might needs friends later.", "NTA. That poor woman is being isolated be her husband. Maybe he just thinks it's awkward because you're his coworker but he's a big boy and needs to get over that. At worst he's trying to control who she communicates with.

Thank you for being a kind person and befriending this woman who was left alone at an event she was supposed to enjoy with her husband.  \n\nI'm with most other commenters that his behavior sounds controlling and I wonder what else is going on in her relationship with him.

Also the age difference in their relationship is concerning. You have done nothing wrong and I love Swifties looking out for each other (we had more tickets realised last week for Australian tour and I went to the in person queue, a dad was trying to get tickets for his wife and daughter and he didn\u2019t understand why we would tell other people to try the in person queue, I explained that we all want the best chance people were all in the online system too but it was weird non queue but random luck)", "NTA.\n\nYou and his wife has barely communicated.

Not to mention she made the cookies, replied, and clearly seems interested in a friendship with you. As someone who was manipulated and triangulated in an abusive situation for two years by someone similar, not only are you not the asshole, but she is definitely in danger staying with him.  He clearly does not support her individuality, interests, or flourishment and I would try to keep in contact with her and support her through this, even if you can't outright get involved.", "What kind of cookies? And how were they?", "Nta. I think it\u2019s totally ok for him to be uncomfortable with his wife reaching out to you\u2026but that\u2019s a conversation he needs to have with his wife and not you. Purely on the side of preserving your mental health you might want to put some distance between yourself/your career and whatever they have going on in their relationship though.", "NTA but just to give the flip side of what everyone here is going with, maybe vivian overshares on socials & he wants to keep his personal life separate from work", "* \n\n* update \n I didnt see that OP was a woman. Thank you guys for pointing that out. Disregard this comment below  because in that case you're NTA \n\nYTA. You are communicating with his wife and commeting on her social media and he of course has a problem with it. Regardless of whether he left her at rhe concert if he's asked you to cut communication with HIS wife then you absolutely should respect that. You're not in love with her so the only things that happening is your causing problems in your friendship with him and in their own relationship. If you weren't commenting on her stuff and she wasn't reaching out to you via messages this would be different,  but the fact you flat out refused is a huge red flag and he most likely will assume that you and her have something else going on . You may not be cheating with her but you are causing problems in a relationship and that's not ok. You went from being tagged in group things to having private conversations and that's a boundary most relationships don't cross.", "Very soft YTA here just because this guy sounds abusive (if that's how he talks to a coworker at work,just imagine how he is at home) and the one who might end up enduring the backlash is Vivian. My guess is that, as usual in these situations, he's been keeping her isolated to maintain control and you becoming her friend threatens that. If you have a way to slip a discreet msg to her, please see if you can agree on some sort of password to request help. I don't even know this woman and I'm worried about her because that guy gives me bad vibes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It seems very selfish, like he doesn\u2019t like the band, so therefore, he can\u2019t be bothered to share it with her.\n\nThe age thing doesn\u2019t bother me by itself, but taken with some of his other actions, does seem like a red flag.", "NTA Controlling much? And behind her back, too. Isolating her without her knowing it.", "This was my thought. As soon as I read there was a 10ish year age gap, I was creeped out.

That and the fact that he just abandoned his wife at the movie makes him seem like a massive, controlling asshole. I'm definitely not a Taylor Swift fan, but I happily sat through the movie because my girlfriend wanted me to go with her. As it turns out, I'm more of a Taylor Swift fan that I realized/was willing to admit.", "This.

Wants his wife to feel like she isn\u2019t good enough to have friends and that she shouldn\u2019t trust people. This helps him keep his illusion of him being the only one she can talk/turn to.  I think op is totally nta. \n\nTA\u2019s don\u2019t invite people who are alone into their group with good intentions (asOP did) \n\nI feel so bad for Vivian*", "Yes, exactly!", "This", "It's also possible he wants to cheat or is cheating on his wife with a woman from work, and is now pissed that OP has a way of alerting her of any suspicious office behavior.", "Don't forget he left her alone at the concert", "Oh I told the girls in the group chat, and they think kts a red flag too. Vivian it's not on the group chat yet, we only have her in FB and follow her in IG. One of my friends that was at the comcert movie too suggested adding her on Discord and telling her what her  husband told me, and I was thinking about doing that.", "Danish biscuits, really tasty", "Why is it 'totally ok' for him to be uncomfortable that his wife reaching out to another (straight) female in a friendly way? Especially when the only reason they became semi-friends in the first place was because he ditched his wife at a concert because he was bored, with no concern about her being there by herself. Is she not allowed to have friends? Or only friends that he has vetted for her?", "Then that is a conversation between him and his wife", "uhh, do you think women are possessions ?  this is a bad take.", "There is nothing wrong with having platonic relationships regardless of the gender of both parties.  If you are upset by the thought of your spouse discussing cookies and music with anyone, you might want to work on that.", "What an odd take.  You got that OP is a woman and straight, right?  Did you just blow right past the 30F and the part where she says she straight?  And that women are often\u2026gasp\u2026friends with other women.", "Don\u2019t you think that problems in the relationship should be between the co-worker and his wife, and not have anything to do with OP? He doesn\u2019t own his wife, she\u2019s her own person.\n\nIf he feels like Vivian talking to OP on social media is causing problems in their relationship, he should talk to Vivian about it. Unless OP is spreading gossip or private information I don\u2019t really understand why he even cares. \n\nWhy do you say \u201che of course has a problem with it\u201d? What\u2019s boundary-crossing about a conversation regarding cookies?", "Age gap relationship, abandons her at a concert, doesn't want her to have friends. The guy has enough red flags to open a circus. Maybe OP should become Ms-steals-yo-girl, would be doing her a favour. NTA.", "It was him abandoning his own wife at a concert. Like wtf, even if you don't like it, dont fucking leave your wife alone like shes just some friend. Did she even have a mean to leave afterwards?", "Not a red flag a whole ass stop sign!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'm not sure she is exactly 20, she looks somewhere between 19-23ish? Like a college girl.\n\nThe drinking age here is 18. \n\nStill, I agree the age gap is creepy,  he was born before the Berlin Wall fell, she was born after Legally Blonde came out.", "OP never says her coworker's wife is \"20\" she says \"early-20s\" which could be anywhere in the range of 20-23 or even 25 if she just looks young.", "Um, what did you read? As nothing you said makes any sense. He is 36. No where does it say she is under 21. A 10 year age gap would be 26. Also, the world is not USA. Most countries have sane drinking ages.", "Is was absolutely a power play move. He expected her to sit and cry or follow him home and have a miserable time. Abusive much.", "Perhaps he wanted to explore the office side chick scene and now OP can alert his wife to anything suspicious in the break room.", "I'm so glad you got away.", "Happy Cake Day!", "We all know it was the Taylor Swift movie, dunno why OP doesn't just say that.", "I have negative levels of interest in Taylor Swift, but I wouldn't think twice about going to see that movie if my wife wanted to because I love her and want her to be happy. Dude from the OP is giving off...not great vibes.", "Do it.  Make sure she knows she could've already been poisoned against you and blocked you.  Hopefully not so hurry up before he either figures out the friends and blocks them too.", "There\u2019s no way of knowing what\u2019s going on in their relationship\u2026who knows if there\u2019s some toxic history there. People are gonna feel how they\u2019re gonna feel whether it\u2019s ok with YOU or anyone else.", "that\u2019s why I said NTA", "I stand corrected. I didn't see that OP was a woman.  That obviously changes things!", "OK, that hurts - I saw both. At least the Berlin Wall was erected before I was born. I remember the gas crisis of the 1970s and the death of John Belushi.", "My bad, you're right. I thought I saw her age as 20, but I see I was mistaken now. Thanks for pointing that out", "He grew up in the 90s she was born after 9/11", "Yo when he was 16 in the middle of high school she wasn't even born yet", "HE AIN'T GOT NO LOVE FOR TAY? DITCH THIS CLOWN AND GET YOU A SWIFTY MY GIRL", "Why does that change things? Op could be a lesbian trying to hit on a married woman. Nah, you're just misogynistic and controlling like Vivians husband.", "It doesn't change anything. It's still clear either way that he doesn't want her having any friends.", "Lmfao I am a woman , nice to assume that I'm misogynistic tho lol. There's a diffence between controlling and having boundaries . You shouldn't throw around the misogynistic word and controlling words without actually having any context \ud83d\udc4d. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why that changes things, that's common sense. OP asked everyone their opinions and I gave mine , not sure why you felt you needed to argue with me over it"]}
