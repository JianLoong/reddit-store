I knew before we got together that she suffered from depression but I knew she was on antidepressants and doing what she can to keep it managed. We have lived together for a year. \n\nMy gf went through multiple different antidepressants last year and had a therapist for a while but due to waiting lists on the NHS she wasn't entitled to much for free. For the last few months I've noticed her mood getting worse. She is quiet and will often just ignore me completely yet still talks to other people. When she does talk she snaps and gives short answers. She said she was starting to feel bad again so I sat and listened to her. I asked if she was going to go to the doctors to see if they can do anything and she said no. She also said she wouldn't put herself on the waiting list for therapy. \n\nShe said she'll just see if her mood improves. It hasn't and she's still the same so I tried explaining to her how the silent treatment is making me feel and how it hurts to know my own partner will barely talk to me. I said we can't go on as we are and she really needs to speak to someone about it. She again refused so I told her I couldn't stay in a relationship like this where she is clearly needing help yet refusing it and taking her low mood out on me. \n\nShe called me an AH for giving her an ultimatum and said she doesn't need the doctor. She said I was out of line and should be supporting her.

It was a realistic view of the consequences of her refusal to get medical help.", "NTA.  Sometimes, you have to put the oxygen mask on yourself first, before you can help someone else. You're at that point in this relationship. \n\nYour soon-to-be-ex girlfriend isn't able to take care of herself, let alone a relationship.  The kindest thing is to side step her emotional blackmail and to end the relationship.  Hopefully,  it will give her the space that she needs to care for herself.", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be miserable because of her unwillingness to get help.", "NTA\n\nIt is not her fault she has depression but it is her responsibility to get treatment for it. It\u2019s impossible to constantly support someone who at best ignores you. \nDon\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Just reiterate your boundary and leave if she refuses to engage with medical professionals. Your life is worth more than standing by this behavior.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA with a leaning towards no ah here: She is a grown up and can make her own decisions - even if they're bad ones.\n\nWhat she cannot expect is for you to put your own mental health in jeopardy while she is deciding not to take care of her own health.", "NTA. You are allowed to set boundaries around how you allow yourself to be treated in relationships. If she was getting help that would be one thing, but she is refusing help and seemingly content to continue to treat you poorly. Does she have any suggestions other than \"wait and see,\" which is clearly not working? \n\nIt's a tough time right now for mental health with waiting lists, as you mentioned. Depression/anxiety can make it incredibly hard to seek help when in the trenches, AND you both deserve to be treated well in your partnership. There's not a great solution unfortunately, but doing nothing isn't fair to either of you. Good luck.", "This is a tricky one, isn\u2019t it, but I\u2019m going with NTA.\n\nThe NHS has its problems, and waiting lists are one, but talking therapy is now the first line treatment for depression as recommended by NICE. It used to be a combination of antidepressant medication and talking therapies, but the newest guidelines say just the talky talky stuff and medication only if the patient specifically asks for it.\n\nI am a mental health nurse in the NHS, and I also suffer with chronic depression. I\u2019m currently well, and that thanks to a combination of medication and also talking therapies (which, incidentally, I pay for privately).\n\nOne of the biggest frustrations I encounter professionally is people who don\u2019t want to engage in the help available. No, it isn\u2019t perfect and no, it\u2019s not quick to access, and no talking about your difficulties is not an easy thing to do. And yes, when you\u2019re so depressed just getting out of bed seems like a mountainous task, the thought of engaging in talking therapies can seem impossible. \n\nBut it isn\u2019t. You have to dig that little bit deeper and find it within you to do it. That\u2019s the first step to recovery. Help is there, but you have to engage in it. That\u2019s on the person with the illness. Nobody else can do that for them.\n\nIt sounds like you have sat down with your partner and explained the impact their illness is having not just on them, but on you too. I understand them feeling challenged by this, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.\n\nAlso as an aside, them engaging with others but not with you isn\u2019t something you should be taking too personally. I know that I have done the same when unwell. I make such a monumental effort to engage with others that it\u2019s exhausting, and then with my partner I just don\u2019t do it - because a) I\u2019m too knackered and b) I feel like I don\u2019t need to because they understand. \n\nPoint b) is incorrect but it\u2019s how I feel at the time.\n\nYou can only help your partner so much, the rest they have to do themselves. Good luck to both of you.", "NTA. She says you should be supporting her but you have been and she completely shuts down your feelings when you tell her what's bothering you and how you feel about the relationship. It's selfish of her to expect you to just trudge along and accept her poor treatment of you when she refuses to try and fix it. You have every right to leave and not be an AH for it, despite what her and her friends and family or reddit would say.", "I don't really see this as an ultimatum, at least not as you worded it here. You are pointing out that you have limits to what you can tolerate in a relationship. NTA", "NTA. She is talking to other people but not to you, so it's rather not about depression, it's about your relationship.", "NTA- it's not her fault she has depression but it's her responsibility to manage it. It's not on you to tiptoe around her and just deal with her constantly giving you the silent treatment. If she is unwilling to do the work to get better/ improve her mental health then you have every right to leave the relationship. It's just like if someone you were dating was an alcoholic and not addressing it. Would you be expected to stay with them? Probably not, so why would this be any different?", "NTA. It's very hard try to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.\n\nIt's crushing see someone wee loving making poor decisions and hurting themselves, but it is what it is, sometimes just when the support goes away people can realize what they're losing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your gf isn't really in a position to care for and nurture herself let alone a relationship. It's one thing to choose not to get help for herself, but if she's not going to get help so that she can nurture (or at the very least, be present in) your relationship then you have every right to say \"I can't continue to be in a one-sided relationship where I am being treated badly.\" \n\nYou can't force her to get help (and honestly the free NHS therapy is a joke from my experience), but you can set expectations for how you're treated in a relationship, and if she doesn't want to meet those expectations then you have a right to decide if you want to continue in a relationship like this. NTA.", "NTA for feeling unfulfilled in your relationship and wanting it to change. I\u2019m in her position right now and I ended my relationship as part of it. He still wants to work it out but I don\u2019t want anyone else on my sinking ship. I used to shut down and couldn\u2019t communicate because he couldn\u2019t help me and my dark thoughts made it so that I couldn\u2019t feel fulfilment in my relationship at all. He just stopped being my person because in *my* brain, depression and love can\u2019t coexist. \n\nThe only thing that sucks about it is that she will feel abandoned in her darkest hour, but not a lot of people can handle being in a relationship with a depressive. Think about what you really want, and if that is a happy woman who doesn\u2019t darken the room, then leave.", "NTA  You are doing the right thing for you.\n\n\"should be supporting her.\"\n\nYou are supporting her, but you're giving her what she needs (encouragement  to seek professional help) but not what she wants (To be her therapist).  That's not a fair ask of you to either tolerate her isolating behavior, be her emotional punching bag, or become her therapist.", "NTA this sounds more like a boundary than an ultimatum. It\u2019s absolutely okay for you to make it known that you can\u2019t continue on this current path because it\u2019s affecting you negatively.\n\nMental health doesn\u2019t just \u201cget better\u201d, it requires work and, usually, professional help. You can\u2019t help her if she won\u2019t help herself and trying to carry that weight destroys a lot of marriages.", "NAH but she needs help. You shouldn\u2019t be leaving her though. Help her get the help she needs in offering to make appointments and calls etc. As someone with depression, that would help me a lot. If my partner of 2 years left me during deep depression it would be a very unsafe thing for me, but you don\u2019t have to stay if she won\u2019t even take your help.", "*Framing* it as an ultimatum (i.e. presenting it as a threat in order to manipulate) does push the situation into AH territory, but cutting it to the core:-  you have to make decisions about your future, and the one of whether or not to continue the relationship is contingent on foreseeing a potential improvement in her state.\n\nGiving her the information that this is what you intend to base your decision on, so she can make her own informed decision on how to proceed by itself is a necessary thing to do - it just shouldn't take the form of an attempt to force the other person to take that action.\n\nNTA, as what has been described doesn't seem to have crossed the line, although I am mindful of the possibility that the actual conversation may differ somewhat from OP's recounting.", "NTA Being depressed is never anyone's fault. But refusing to get help and treat the depression is. Sometimes a person needs to hit rock bottom to wake them up and realize that they do need help. Your GF seems to be one of them.", "NTA.\n\n> She again refused so I told her I couldn't stay in a relationship like this where she is clearly needing help yet refusing it and taking her low mood out on me.\n\nThis isn't an ultimatum, this is a boundary.  You're not telling her to do anything; you're giving her information on your own response to various situations so she can make choices about what she will do.\n\n> She said I was out of line and should be supporting her.\n\nShe's out of line.  She needs to be supporting herself.\n\nMy man, I'd break up with her if I were you; you don't have clarity.  You've started to normalize being treated like shit.", "Why would you lean towards 'NAH' when she's clearly weaponizing her mental health to browbeat OP into submission?", "She won't accept help. I've offered to book an appointment with her GP but she refuses and there isn't much else I can do. \n\nAs bad as it might sound I need to put my own health first and if my partner is refusing to even try to receive help and it's having a negative impact on me then I would have to leave. Again it would be different if I could see her attempting to get help.\n\nWith regard to your comment about your partner leaving being unsafe, I don't mean to sound harsh here at all but that would not be on your partner. If they let because you were refusing help then you can't but any blame on what may happen after that on your partner"]}
