You also may want to suggest some boundaries around how much she can use the tablet. If she\u2019s 4 and sitting there so long she pees herself she needs some regulations around how long and when to be on it.", "NTA.  Tablets are no excuse especially at four.  It is the parent\u2019s job to make the child stop playing and use the restroom hourly if they won\u2019t go themselves.  You gf is a crap parent and if she thinks it is okay for a four year old to play on a tablet until she pees herself.  Your gf is using the tablet as a babysitter and not paying attention.", "NTA. And that is a serious tablet addiction. She's in for a tough road if that isn't broken up soon.", "NTA - pretty reasonable to not want a kid to piss on your furniture.", "NTA but she doesn't need a diaper, she needs a better mother.... one who doesn't let her play on a tablet all the time and actually engages with her to teach her things like recognizing when she needs to use the bathroom and going promptly. \n\nIf you think she'll be a better mother to your own future kids, you're delusional. And if you think you'd be able to fully compensate for her lack, you need to see that having two kids in the same home but with different rules and standards will only create resentment and more problems. \n\nDo not have children with this woman. She's at least borderline neglectful.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019d put waterproof mattress pads down on her bed and make sure that\u2019s where she sleeps. And I would be telling your GF she needs to talk to the pediatrician. Seems like she\u2019s not doing a very good job of potty training if she\u2019s always waiting and not prompting her child.", "NTA. Brain-bladder maturity varies so some kids might be dry immediately when they're day-time potty trained at 2.5-3 years old or some may not be. My pediatrician said they don't even consider bed wetting an issue until 8 years old. That does not mean they're immune from accidents during the day or night after potty training. Its completely normal for a child who is immersed in a distraction to have an accident. There is nothing abnormal about a 4 year old testing the limit of their bladder repeatedly - its a normal developmental pushing of limits. \n\nThe asshole is your girlfriend. She is letting the tablet care for her child and ignoring her responsibilities as a parent. When my kid did limit testing and boundary pushing with her physical well-being, I had to put my foot down. Repeatedly losing control of your bladder because you ignored signals to void it sooner is bad for the bladder and her ability to hold urine when she must. It messes up the muscles to be regularly forced to work to the point of failure. \n\nStep one: get nighttime pull ups. There is no chance she will successfully hold her bladder or do nighttime potty training when she is having these issues during the day. Next, your girlfriend needs to monitor the situation and observe her child's signals they are holding urine and not listening to her body.", "You\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch in your new house?\n\nEither way NTA.", "At first I thought you meant addicted to medication, but looks like that's not the sort of tablet you mean! \n\nA 4yo doesn't get to decide how long they use a tablet: you're the parents so you're in charge. \n\n- Limit screen time and take the tablet away two hours before bed.\n- Help her recognise the signs she needs to go ('you're jiggling your leg: do you need a wee?').\n- Set a sensible bedtime, say 6.30 for a story, light out at 7pm, wearing pullups until she doesn't need one (she needs 12 hours' sleep at that age).\n- About 10pm or when you go to bed, wake her up for a nighttime wee; when she's used to it she'll stay half asleep.\n\nETA: NTA, but your GF might be. No point in being a SAHM if you don't want to do the job.", "I remember when i was a kid i was addicted to N64, i would hold that shit in until i was about to burst but never pissed myself. Its a real addiction that I no longer have but parents don't care as long as they get some peace and quiet from their kids.", "NTA - The piss soaked furniture is the least of your problems. If the child is consistantly holding in her urine for extended periods of time than she is running the risk for urinary tract/bladder infections. These can be serious especially if the infection travels into the kidneys.", "NTA..this sounds like a serious problem that needs a lot more attention.", "ESH. Your gf\u2019s daughter *needs help* if she is addicted to the tablet to the point of peeing herself. Gf should not be letting this go on and you shouldn\u2019t be letting her.\n\nBut if you\u2019re that worried about the couch, stop falling asleep on it with her and expecting a different outcome when nothing else has changed.", "NTA, that's reasonable.\n\n`Her daughter is 4 and has gotten better with wetting the bed but still pees herself during the day because she's addicted to tablets and doesn't go pee until its dripping down her leg.`\n\nUnsolicited advice but it's possible the kid has some condition that affects bladder control, or the ability to feel the need to pee. Might want to see a doctor just to be on the safe side.", "Your girlfriend us NOT a SAHM, she's a SAHGF.\n\nAt that age, mom should be making sure the kiddo at least tries to use the bathroom every once in a while.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with pull-ups at night and plastic mattress protectors and covers.\n\nThe kid should be in preschool a few hours a week, but no one will accept a kid that's not potty trained.  Your girlfriend in the AH here, both to you and her child.", "NTA this is literally what diapers exist for", "NTA bigger question why is your gf not taking action to limit tablet time to avoid this situation? is the tablet raising the child, which seems to be common these days?", "There I believe is the problem, everything is a \"trauma\" these days. its one thing to be forced to wear a diaper for many yrs because a parent wants to feel like their kid isn't aging (actual mental situation) and forced to wear a diaper until you stop weeting yourself.", "NTA\n\nWater proof mattress pads are a simple solution but won\u2019t her feel like a baby 4 year olds are strangely judgmental and wearing I diaper may make her feel bad, but there is definitely a serious issue with her not getting up to use the bathroom during the day. Talk to your gf about putting restrictions in place or have timed bathroom breaks. With gf as a SAHM having alarms set to dictate bathroom time wouldn\u2019t be impossible. And with anyone I feel it is important to use the bathroom before bed, if she sees you or her mom do it eventually she\u2019ll recognize it as part of the bedtime routine and isn\u2019t a huge ask for gf to help with this stuff.", "Well... diaper is fine but you REALLY need to focus on toilet training. Just putting her in a diaper and letting it go is going to screw her over. She needs to be able to sleep all night dry and not need a diaper anymore ASAP.\n\nthe peeing with the tablet thing is really, really concerning. It's obvious you and your gf aren't interacting with her and are just leaving her on her tablet for hours at a time and that's fucked up. She needs other kinds of activities, like coloring and toy that will help with other muscle groups. That will help break up her focus .\n\nAre you *reminding* her to go to the bathroom? Are you giving her breaks after 45 minutes? She needs to be drinking water too. She needs to be in contact with the real world, and talking to her family.\n\nTablets are fucking eating some children. Their brains are so dulled and they start school at a deficit... just sitting on a screen doesn't make up for playing outside, manipulating objects for motor skills, interacting with others for communication and word skills...\n\nYTA, especially your gf,for letting your kid live on a tablet with so little human interaction that she is pissing herself. You aren't even letting her be human. Bring her into your world... she's a PERSON.", "NAH\n\nDiapers aren't the only solution, you can get waterproof blankets and stuff. Google it.", "ESH she needs to detox from electronics. Fix the problem, not the symptom.", "I have two kids and am a stay at home mom. My oldest (7) is autistic and has ADHD, youngest (3) probably does as well. My kids use tablets a lot, BUT we still moderate how much we let them use them. We would also severely question allowing them to have them if this was happening. \n\nYour girlfriend needs to learn to say no to her daughter. It will 100% be hard at first with tons of tantrums because the 4yo has gotten used to having the tablet whenever she wants, but eventually with some tough love and CONSISTENCY (as in a special time for the tablet or a time limit) she will understand the rules and start to accept them. My daughters can both grasp these boundaries well even with disabilities that cause them to have big feelings that make them push boundaries. \n\nAlso it might be worth investing in a waterproof cover of some kind. Putting a diaper on a 4 year old who thinks they are diaper trained might be kind of demoralizing and upset the kiddo. Taking the tablet away and offering more potty breaks seems like a more positive route than putting a four year old back in diapers because her mom doesn\u2019t know how to parent properly. \n\nNTA.", "ESH - I don't know about a diaper... But they make training pullups, as well as specific night time pullups. You're being a little stuck up. She's 4yo dude....
