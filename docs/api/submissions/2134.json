Doesn't seem like a surprise to me that bio-Mom feels rejected. And, of course, both of these things (divorce, wedding) are as public as it gets for most people. So her whole family and family friends get to see what she has indicated is a humiliation for her.\n\nNow, obviously, it's OP's wedding; his mom's humiliation is not an objective.

That is WAY too long to hold a grudge.", "24 years ago!", "Lol not wanting your son to dance with the affair partner is \u201cnot being over it\u201d.", "I\u2019m not saying anything about getting divorced. No one should stay in a bad marriage. Having a dance at your wedding with the woman your dad cheated with is disgusting.", "This is such an apathetic sugar-coated \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d mindset", "Yes I do because he has no empathy for his own mother he doesn\u2019t care", "Huh?\n\nIf you\u2019re referring to my post about my ex, you can ask my kids. I have *only* encouraged a positive relationship with both my ex and his wife, in fact to my kids\u2019 detriment. To this day I refuse to speak poorly about them to my kids.", "All while denying that\u2019s what they did. That\u2019s the part I can\u2019t get over. It\u2019s been how many years now, and Dad and Step Mom still haven\u2019t acknowledged their affair. It\u2019s like winning because your opponent was disqualified and telling everyone how hard you worked for that win. Yeah, you may have trained and worked hard to get to the level you did, but you still won because the other person was disqualified.", "If my husband I am split, for any reason, and another woman is lucky enough to call my kids her bonus kids, I am going to celebrate it. Loving another person doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love me. Love is not a zero sum game. I am astounded at the level of petty in these comments.", "It's called being an adult and not weaponizing your children against there other parent. No matter what happens between the two of you they are the victims, not the tools to your revenge.", "She didnt take it over. She just had a motherly role when OP was in their custody.\n\nHe has his bio mom and hia step mom being motherly to him. Thats literally a bonus parent.", "lol i think we found mom's reddit account", "I believe that an emotional affair is far worse than a sexual one. Not everyone can separate the two though.", "It's comical how many people think he never crossed the physical boundary until after the divorce. So unlikely.", "I am glad that your story has ended so much better than most on here. It is so rare. I have noticed by being on here either the new step parent treats the child horrible or they try to replace the parent. You are very lucky.", "You\u2019re allowed to be upset. \n\nChoose your venue.", "I mean, of course. It\u2019s a reddit comment thread. \n\nBut my sentiments are legitimate.", "No not saying that at all- but if you need to vent about your feelings, maybe don\u2019t tell someone who\u2019s immediately going to bitch out the other person. \n\nLike there are people in my family who I can tell literally anything, and then there are the shit stirrers. If I\u2019m having an issue with another family member I *do not tell the shit stirrers*.\n\nETA: My point in saying that is that now Mom\u2019s feelings have been turned into OP\u2019s *problem* that he has to resolve. OP isn\u2019t responsible for the possible affair or Mom\u2019s feelings of replacement- he should *understand* where she\u2019s coming from, but ultimately those feelings are her responsibility, as shitty as it is for Mom :(", "It\u2019s an assumption, sure, but a likely one. Take out \u201ccheated on her\u201d and insert \u201creplaced her with\u201d and my point still stands. \n\nWe agree that Mom is an asshole, but I wouldn\u2019t be so cavalier about saying she rooted for her son to have a bad relationship with Alice given the context that they *both* raised him in a very similar way- Alice just helped him more financially and has a similar personality. \n\nJust seems like a rough situation for everyone except Alice and Dad who have everything they wanted, you know? Like I\u2019m just being gentle about the Mom\u2019s feelings given that it sounds like for all intents and purposes, she was ALSO a wonderful mom and her feelings are understandable.\n\nShe\u2019s just in the wrong for making them OP\u2019s problem. We\u2019re all just advising OP to be gentle with Mom and try and understand her because it sounds like he wants a good relationship with both of them", "That's such a shame. Your mom deserves a much better family.", "Yta for prioritizing the woman who bought your love and punishing the one who couldn\u2019t afford to send you to school. I get that personalities didn\u2019t mesh but it also doesn\u2019t seem like you gave her a chance", "Of couse she has to prioritize her retirement,  she doesn't have a family anymore that will help her. Alice has it now.", "You have every right to love \nAlice as much or more than you do your mom. You have every right to be grateful that Alice was able to help you more financially. Your dad broke your mom\u2019s heart and she never got over it, that\u2019s on her for not being able to move on. She doesn\u2019t sound stupid she knows how you feel about Alice. If you choose to publicly at your wedding your mom and Alice on equal footing it will embarrass and crush your mom. Right or wrong, in her mind she already lost her husband to Alice and now she\u2019s losing her only son to her too.", "No, it isn\u2019t. She needs therapy to get over something that happened over 2 decades ago. Expecting this kind of \u201cloyalty\u201d from children is disgusting, toxic, and manipulative. Her relationship failed, and that\u2019s her problem, not her kid\u2019s. He has every right to have a positive relationship with whoever has a part in raising him. My mother demanded this kind of shit from me, and treated me like shit most of my life because I \u201creminded her of my father\u201d and it\u2019s a form of abuse.", "But that woman literally raised him. For at least 13 years and apparently kept being a mother to him.", "That same woman helped him with a college education... \nSo you have to be respectful that She is viewed much differently in his eyes...", "Yeah maybe, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your son\u2019s fault? Blaming him for having a relationship with his dad\u2019s wife is ridiculous. He wasn\u2019t part of the affair and he had to spend time with his dad after the divorce. Mom\u2019s emotions being channeled into weaponizing her son against her cheating ex is unfair.\n\nI\u2019d imagine there\u2019s NO WAY OP\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s close with his stepmom. This isn\u2019t going to be new information. Her being vocally upset that his stepmom (who he is close to) is also getting a dance with him at HIS wedding is very unfair. It\u2019s been 22 years, he\u2019s been close to his stepmom that whole time, it\u2019s his wedding. Mom has the right to decline to participate and say it\u2019s because she isn\u2019t comfortable with his stepmom being involved. She does NOT have the right to accuse him of replacing her and emotionally blackmail him by comparing this to the act of *cheating on her.* OP is NTA for wanting a dance with a maternal figure he\u2019s close to. Mom wouldn\u2019t be the A H if she had simply chosen to bow out after stating her discomfort, but she IS the AH for trying to make OP change his mind by accusing him of being like his dad.", "It\u2019s been 20 years. Not last Tuesday. This woman clearly helped raise this man, and supported him to get to this place in his life. He doesn\u2019t have to hate her just because his mother does.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No he didn\u2019t choose sides. It\u2019s not his problem. He\u2019s allowed to have relationships with all of his parents. He is the child. None of that is his fault.", "Y\u2019all he is the child. He did not make a poor decision. His father did. He made the best of a situation he had no control over. If y\u2019all can\u2019t see that idk what to say to you. He\u2019s allowed other relationships besides his mother. I wonder how much of a fit his mother threw when the \u2018shrew\u2019 (your words not mine) paid for his education?", "And is his step mom", "You have to get to a point where what you thought your life would be isn't the reality...I can suck up my bitter (but understandable) feelings for one day for the sake of my child.", "The \"affair partner\" took care of your son and paid for his education.\n\nLet me do simple maths.\nIf Alice paid for OPs education... it means his mom only paid part of it or none. So she is not just an \"affair partner\"\n\nAnd its not like OP isnt also dancing with his mom. He dances with both.", "As far as OP knows, there was no cheating.", "But it\u2019s really irrelevant to the issue at hand. When my parents divorced, my dad almost immediately started dating my now step-mom, who he had known for a long time. He swears he didn\u2019t cheat on my mom with her, but it really doesn\u2019t matter to me. I don\u2019t want to know the specifics, much like OP, because it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was a great step-mom.", "I know this is a minority response but, who the fuck cares.\n \nThings are only as dramatic as you let them be. People are people and if the dad had an affair, yeah that's shitty, but it doesn't make them them the monsters everyone here wants them to be. The world isn't black and white, and the OP has a good relationship with his stepmother. \n\nMom can put on her big girl panties and deal for one night for her kid. He's not forcing his mom to dance with the stepmother. Her son's wedding is about him and his new life, not about something that may or may not have happened 24 years ago.", "And Reddit had definitely opened my eyes to how lucky I am!", "You don\u2019t get to hurt someone then be mad they told the truth just because that person doesn\u2019t agree with you. Sorry.", "I actually agree with this.  It's not her duty to suffer in silence, no.  But i definitely would expect her to tell whoever she tells NOT to immediately go chew out my CHILD because they have hurt my feelings.  That's not their place.  If I wanted my child to know how i felt, I would have told THEM. Not the person I trusted my feelings to.", "It\u2019s also been 23 years tho? It\u2019s sucks being cheated on. It sucks feeling replaced. But if she is still that upset and angry enough to have a fit 23 years later she needs therapy.", "Her relationship failed because this woman stole her husband.", "You are totally misunderstanding what I am a saying. I am not saying he has to hate her. He is free to have a good relationship with her. He is humiliating his own mother by dancing with her. If he is ok with that then go for it but I would rather die before I humiliated my own mother like that. Again I\u2019m not an asshole.", ">\tThe divorce happened after my dad fell in love with his current wife/my stepmom Alice.\n\nTry reading the post again.", "Sooooo he should have waited to be divorced before sleeping with her but he totally didnt because no guy who get divorced before having sex????\n\nAnd you dont see the problem with your logic?\n\nNo one should be forced to stay in an unhappy relationship.", "Except OP is not responsible for any of this? He\u2019s trying to honor two women who did the exact same thing: raise him. \n\nAll of the other stuff has nothing to do with OP. It\u2019s fine for Mom to be hurt, but OP isn\u2019t an ass for trying to honor Mom AND Alice. I feel bad for Mom but why does OP deserve to be screamed at by Aunt?", "His mother is choosing to be humiliated. Or, she could have put in her big girl panties at any point in the last 20 years and be happy that her son has another adult in his life to love him, and care for him. My parents got divorced well before my dad married my step mom and I still dealt with my bio moms hurt feelings at my wedding. It was a shit show. She wanted to sit next to my dad, a man she HATED just so that my step mother couldn\u2019t sit there. At the end of the day, if his mother decides that a dance is more important that her relationship with her son, then that is her choice. But it would be sad for all involved.", "That\u2019s a her problem then.", "And the very next sentence:\n\n>They claim they didn't cheat but waited to be separated before anything physical happened.", "Because siblings typically are protective and it is shit to put the AP on the same pedestal as mom because he is grateful for her money.", "Did your dad cheat with your step mom?", "How dumb are you? Falling in love with someone else while still married isn\u2019t cheating?"]}
