It's great that OP has a good relationship with his stepmom; that so often isn't the case. But I fully get mom's point of view: dad did replace her and OP's basically saying he w/could too as stepmom is just as great as bio mom, and in fact, better, because they're closer. Doesn't seem like a surprise to me that bio-Mom feels rejected. And, of course, both of these things (divorce, wedding) are as public as it gets for most people. So her whole family and family friends get to see what she has indicated is a humiliation for her.\n\nNow, obviously, it's OP's wedding; his mom's humiliation is not an objective.

That was a choice she made and she does have to live with her actions. I agree with your mother.

But to her, she watched her husband leave her for this woman and for the same woman to bond with her child. You will never know what she\u2019s feeling or understand. \n\nThe point is, yes, you should have two but be realistic and expect consequences.", "OP, I have a similar familial situation as you, with a bitter mom over the maybe-affair from years and years ago. \n\nMy siblings and I were closer to our stepmom than we\u2019ve ever been with our mom. The bitterness certainly didn\u2019t help, nor did the accusations of betrayal as we were young kids trying to navigate the relationship with our dad and stepmom. \n\nI\u2019m in my 40s now. We lost our stepmom just a few months ago. I went through all the guilt again, as my mom didn\u2019t like how devastated we were since it felt like losing a mother. \n\nI know your mom was hurt. But that was her hurt to work through, and tossing you into the middle of that was unfair. \n\nI\u2019m a divorced mother myself now, and my kids now have a stepmom. I tell them having more people to love them is *only* a good thing. I will never, ever cause them to feel even the slightest amount of guilt about having a good relationship with her. Because I lived it, and it was toxic, and it destroyed what remained of the relationship with my mom.", "She was so great that she didn\u2019t care about you having your parents together when she perused your father\u2026", "Do you ever talk to your mother how she felt or what actually when it actually went down now that your an adult because it\u2019s easy to hide the nasty side of cheating/divorce from a 5 year old", "You include her in a dance. She means a lot to you, and you should honor that relationship. Your mom really needs to respect the fact that Alice has been such a strong support to her son.", "That\u2026 doesn\u2019t pertain to anything I just said.", "Why is it OPs responsibility to deal with the adults involved in the affairs feelings? It\u2019s about his relationship with these two women, not the drama they pulled when he was 5 years old", "So what was dad supposed to do? Not falling in love with another woman? We all know that you can't always prevent that from happening. Staying with mom when though he loves someone else?!", "No. This is ridiculous. \n\nOP was only put in the position of having to defend Alice because mom was speaking poorly of her around him. That\u2019s despicable behavior, I understand it happened because mom was hurt, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay. \n\nMom\u2019s had 20 years to go to therapy and come to grips with what it means for her son to have a stepmom, and to figure out how to support that positively.", "Well, to me it sounds like Mom has been completely fine with OP\u2019s relationship with Alice up until this very moment. \n\nMom is about to have OP\u2019s good relationship with the woman her ex cheated on her with thrown in her face in a very, very public way. I don\u2019t blame her for having feelings about that- her initial reaction was based in those resurgent feelings of betrayal. \n\nWhere Mom becomes the AH for me is when she doubled down in telling the family rather than trying to make peace with the fact that Alice is a very different person for her *son* than for her.", "It was 20 years ago. \n\nShe\u2019s had years to go to therapy and learn how to navigate this. \n\nInstead she\u2019s been rooting for OP to not have a close relationship with his stepmom. \n\nShe\u2019s definitely an asshole.", "The 'woman who ended the marriage' ? I'd say, following your logic, that OP's dad ought also be singled out as a sinner who needs to sit down and be quiet.\n\nEither you move on, or you stay stuck in hurt and bitterness and use your feelings to demand that others be punished forever. How about supporting life and happiness on such a great day?", "I mean your post history says otherwise", "Because he's purposefully involving the woman half responsible for breaking up his family. If OP was a decent person he wouldn't invite stepmom", "Yeah like that\u2019s the whole point of being married, not falling in love with other people. If you feel yourself straying you COMMUNICATE with your partner and remove yourself from the situation. Couples counselling, focusing more on your marriage, and if that all falls through you get divorced and then you can pursue other relationships. An emotional affair is still an affair. Saying that you can\u2019t prevent yourself from falling in love with someone else is a shitty excuse and you should never get married with that mindset.", "He could've waited that's all I'm saying.", "The mom had every right to speak poorly of her imo just like every other victim of cheating they are allowed to talk bad about the cheating ex and the affair partner", "I don\u2019t think the mom is an asshole for talking to her sister, though. Is she supposed to just completely bottle her feelings and tell nobody that she feels hurt and betrayed?", "That\u2019s a big assumption, and not true based on OP\u2019s comments. \n\nThen we agree mom is an AH. I also don\u2019t blame her for being hurt. But that\u2019s not what the post is judging. Her behavior makes her the asshole, it\u2019s definitively NTA and not NAH.", "Of course he is a \"sinner\". But he isn't sharing the dance with him is he. In context of this AITA she is the women who ended the marriage. Didn't say she did it alone, but the fact still stands. \n\nIn a perfect world that would happen. But I don't think I would ever be ok with sharing that moment with the AP. A step-parent who a ex started a relationship with after a respectful divorce who loved my child and respected my role as mother, yes, that's a lovely idea. The AP, on a particularly difficult day such as the wedding of their child? Nope.", "Then he needs to exclude his dad as well, forever until everybody dies, from any life event where his stepmother and his father might be seen existing by his unforgiving mother.\n\nWhere does this end?", "He said he did. You don\u2019t know that he didn\u2019t. What if it were proven to be true? Are you then okay with it?", "Well, you\u2019re just wrong. \n\nShe can *think* poorly about her, and can go out for girls nights with her best friends and complain about her all she wants. \n\nIt\u2019s an asshole move to speak poorly about her to her kid, who has to figure out how to have a relationship with this woman.", "Any guy that's willing to put his marriage on the line for another woman. 99% they've already slept together", "Parents are humans too", "So are you saying he should have waited, or shouldn\u2019t have?", "Should have waited. Personally if I was OP I would've given an ultimatum \"stayed married to her or have me in your life\"", "The only thing you know about this family is this post, where OP says dad claimed to have waited. \n\nYou didn\u2019t answer my question. If they proved that to be true, would you be okay with this?"]}
