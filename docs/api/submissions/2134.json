Doesn't seem like a surprise to me that bio-Mom feels rejected. And, of course, both of these things (divorce, wedding) are as public as it gets for most people. So her whole family and family friends get to see what she has indicated is a humiliation for her.\n\nNow, obviously, it's OP's wedding; his mom's humiliation is not an objective.

That was a choice she made and she does have to live with her actions. I agree with your mother.

You\u2019re very cold towards your bio mum - it\u2019s not her fault she was cheated on and left as a single parent/single income household and couldn\u2019t financially help you like Alice has in a two income household. 2. You mention the financial help A LOT and place Alice on a pedestal for this, which means she\u2019s bought your love. 3.

You don\u2019t buy a car without taking it for a test drive OP, so there\u2019s absolutely no way your dad was going to end his marriage with your mum without knowing that he and Alice were a physical match as well as emotional. \n\nI do believe good people make mistakes/do bad things and that shouldn\u2019t consign them to a life of being bad people because they cheated. HOWEVER, your dad and Alice have both demonstrated that they don\u2019t have respect for what marriage means given their affair, and I don\u2019t think they should be glorified during a wedding because of this, it\u2019s like you\u2019re asking for a bad omen. \n\nI honestly cannot imagine showing such a disregard for my own mum in the way you have. Her family was pulled from underneath her, you are her only child and you\u2019re wanting her to share a mother son moment with the woman who tore her family apart - the same woman who then went on to have two biological children of her own, and will more than likely get to experience the mother moment on their wedding days.

Weather or not you want to admit it your dad had it easier. \n\n3. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that Alice could help with college for you but your mom probably feels guilty over not being able to do this even if she hasn\u2019t verbally said it.

Even more so when there are hurt feelings decades after the fact. My parents still hate each other's guts more than 35 years later. Personally, I would choose not to do the dance at all after your mom's reaction and just stick to the father daughter dance your fiancee is planning.

This one kinda has touched on this subreddit's \"you don't owe anyone, especially blood family, anything\" mentality. It's so interesting to see how this post is right on the fence of so many issues.

She has a **right** to be. This is bigger than \u201cyour day,\u201d in this case. Even if your stepmom was an amazing woman and there were no questionable circumstances, your mother grew you in her body and birthed you.

She\u2019s likely dreamed of this moment on this day. \n\nHowever, the circumstances **aren\u2019t** great at all.

It\u2019s like you\u2019re saying all over again (just as your father did) that your stepmother is somehow \u201cbetter.\u201d Yea\u2026 your mom is going to be devastated and angry, and you need to understand that. Hopefully she doesn\u2019t use Reddit or come across this post, as it would be like an emotional acid bath to the face.

They had each other for support in everything, meaning they had more time to be 'fun' etc. Also, Alice had the luxury of being 'parent' *and* friend to op; a role pretty unique to step-parents (not all, obviously). \n\nOP, I'm happy for you that you were able to have another adult around who supports and loves you, and I'm sympathetic to your situation.

Especially on behalf of my dad, and especially after witnessing the effect it had on him. After years passed, I wanted him to move on, too, as it made my life very difficult trying to juggle the wants and needs of both my parents, and I dreaded future events like weddings. But that was an *entirely selfish* desire and was making my *dad* responsible for my *mum's* shitty actions. \n\nDivorce is messy and cheating even more so, not just for the parents' relationship but for the kids' too.

I wanted her service to be more of a visitation, where my family could meet her before the cremation, and because she'd spent her life in a bed, too sick to be cuddled, I was determined that she wouldn't be set down through the entire visitation, because all babies want to be held. My bio dad pushed for a traditional \"preacher talks for 2 hours and no one touches the corpse\" service.

There is no scenario where your mother isn\u2019t hurt. Because cheating causes legitimate trauma to someone\u2019s brain. It literally changes the way a brain functions. It is a life long trauma that cheaters often just expect someone to get over and that is just not psychologically possible. The woman that help destroy your mothers life, that helped to hurt her brain so bad that it affects her TO THIS DAY even though she doesn\u2019t want it to (many people have ACTUAL PTSD from cheating. The brain scans are crazy) got to also get you. There\u2019s no scenario where that doesn\u2019t hurt.

I\u2019m glad you have a good relationship with your step mom, but you are old enough now to try and research the psychological effects of cheating to understand just how awful your step mom and dad were and how messed up it made your mom. She is truly a victim and this is a no win scenario\u2026because every scenario she loses. Doing the right thing and keeping it all in? She loses. Letting it out and showing what she feels? She loses. But the two people that destroyed her world for the rest of her life? They both get everything they want at her expense. \n\nYou are not wrong.
