As kids it\u2019s was always me doing the housework and he did nothing even when asked and he moaned so my mum made me do it. Me (26m) I have always been forced to work hard by our mum who made me get a job at 15 (which my brother didn\u2019t have to do) I got through college and onto higher education which ended up in me getting a great pay job which can get me and my girlfriend (26f) a nice household and help him get out our childhood home. So some key context before we get into it, so the other week me and my girlfriend fount out that we our expecting our first child and we are going save our money for the baby and we plan to announce it on my girlfriend birthday. Anyway getting into it I was at brother apartment the other week and he moaning about how he an old compared to his friend then he asked me to if i could get him one of the cars he was looking at and i replied with \u201cno were saving money at the moment\u201d which of course he didn\u2019t like that and replied with \u201cfor what\u201d and I said \u201cnon of your business\u201d as I walked out the door I thought that would be the end of it until I got a call from my mum screaming that I caused my brother to crash his car which I was very confused about. So apparently he told my mum that I refused to pay for his car breaks to get fixed (which he never told me) so I told he never told me that and then she hung up later that night I\u2019m around his and my mum is their and I explain that I didn\u2019t want to him a new car and he never be anything about breaks but she didn\u2019t believe me. So I ended up asking for the dashboard camera to prove what he saying but just looks like he gone straight into the back of the car and using the breaks as an excuse. But  of course our mum believes him and she calling me a asshole and tell me to pay for all of it including his court case (for the other car damage) which I say no to because of something else they will found out about. She called me a asshole and told me to get out.

Don't let this leach bleed you dry.  I would quit giving him any money, even rent money.  If he wants to spend all his money, let him live with your mum.", "NTA, except to yourself.\n\nYou're going to be a father, you need to step up and act like it.  First, you pay nothing for your brother any more. Not his rent, car, court, or anything else he should be handling himself. Second, you shut your mother down any time she demands you make up for her failed attempt at parenting. She's taken too much already, you have your own family that needs you.", "No you\u2019re NTA. Separate yourself from your freeloading brother and stop using your hard earned money to pay for his recklessness. Save for your family and give yourself the life you deserve because of your hard work", "NTA. Cut contact with both your mom and your brother.

Focus your energy, efforts and money on them.", "Are you seriouos !!!! \n\nCut this toxic ppl out of your life. This is not ok . Does your mom expect your to pay for your brother all your life ? I'm surprised your gf didn't say anything .Cut them off they used and abused you.\n\nAnd why would it be your job to buy him new brakes even if he told you ? wzhy can't he pay for it ? \n\nYou are an AH for letting them do this to you for years . Family doesn't always mean you have to let them treat however they want . When they are abusive get ride of them", "NTA, easily! Plus, out of your kindness, you are helping him with rent etc... At this point, he will never learn as long as everyone is helping him out. Time for some tough love and give him notice that you are pulling support.

They seem horrible.\n\nMake a clean break and support YOUR family - you have a baby on the way! Your mom/brother are simply going to continue to suck you dry and probably affect your relationship with SO and baby.", "NTA\n\nTell your brother that you are 100% DONE. He can either figure out how to be an adult or he can go back to mommy. Tell your mom that your brother was never your responsibility and the gravy train has ended.\n\nAll of your resources belong to your family now. Your family means your partner and child.", "NTA, it would be unsafe to get him a car.  He is unable to care for a car, he shouldn't drive.", "NTA\n\nBut you probably don\u2019t need to be told that. It\u2019s really odd that you willingly foot the bill for him to live as a mooch.

There's no reason you should be supporting an adult.", "NTA, but what are you doing to yourself?\n\nYour brother is a full grown man and needs to take care of himself. If your mother wants to keep enabling him, let HER fund his lifestyle.\n\nYour brother is your mom's precious golden child and you've been the scapegoat and grunt for the both of them all your life. It's time to end the madness and focus on your own life now. \n\nI believe that you've always covered him because she's made this the expectation for your life, that you 'take care' of him and that in doing that, you'll somehow get her to love you like she loves him. Speaking as the non-favorite child myself, that will NEVER happen. \n\nRight now, you need to love yourself enough to get away from the toxic BS created by the both of them. Stop paying for anything related to the care and upkeep of your brother. Either he will sink, swim, or his mother will take care of him but it can't be you anymore.", "NTA Even if what he was saying were true, and he\u2019d asked for money to fix the brakes, and you\u2019d refused, you *still* wouldn\u2019t be TA - it would still have been his responsibility to ensure he didn\u2019t drive if he knew his brakes weren\u2019t working.\n\nLike others have said, cut him off. Tell him you won\u2019t be able to help him with the rent  any more, and start to focus on the family you are making with your partner, rather than your brother, the mooch, and your mother.
