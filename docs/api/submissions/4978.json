I was put off by this - we don\u2019t get along well - and told her thanks, I\u2019ll think about it. She\u2019s texted me again, asking if I\u2019m wearing it, and honestly, it\u2019s making me want to wear it out of spite. I let her know I don\u2019t want to discuss this any further. \n\nAITA?

He is probably as proud of you as you are of him. \n\nThis is his birthday, not his parents or any other family member.", "Just try to ignore it as best you can. She\u2019s a weirdo for caring about this.", "I\u2019d take a lot of Reddit comments with a grain of salt. What this person said could be 100% true, but the truth is we have no idea. All people make assumptions and base their thoughts of that.", "Let me guess, it's a little black dress? Lol, your SIL is just jealous of your beauty and confidence", "hahaha omg op, i love this response! wear the hell out of that dress!! \ud83d\udc8b", "Your husband is telling his brother about your outfit choices for events in the future? I'm sorry, but that's odd? Like how did that even come up?", "NTA is the op but the person is saying the SIL is the AH but maybe forgot the \u201cin law\u201d at the end of sister", "So what are you going to do?", "May have an idea \ud83d\ude0f not hubby but still", "I always bring a sweater or wrap with me to restaurants because some of them are unexpectedly freezing! I hope you have a wonderful time and your SIL pounds sand!", "Thank you! And you're welcome \ud83d\ude0a \n\nHappy birthday to your husband! \ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf82\n\nI hope you both have a great time at the party and you rock the sh!t out of that dress!", "Just throwing out options. If rights don't work with it then that's nbd. (I would be looking into thigh high boots and tiny mesh tops to accessorize with if my SIL tried to tell me how to dress.)", "Oh yea he's weird, to insist she dress like a hooker around the entire family??\n\nDon't be dipshits", "Yeah I think it would make his night, he loves it a lot. It\u2019s a little much around his mom and dad but it\u2019s just one night.", "Ha! My friend said that!", "Hah! My friend said that!", "I vote this, but add in telling her you decided not to wear the dress. But wear the dress", "Oh I like this! I might do this lol", "Hahaha!", "Good reminder!", "You\u2019ve given me confidence!", "Omg I love you lol", "Good point. And yes he was very specific!", "It\u2019s actually white. But little for sure, lol", "His bro asked what we were wearing, so they would have an idea what to wear", "no, i understand that they meant sil when using sister, im saying \u201cnah except sister\u201d makes no sense considering she\u2019s the only other party. the post is only about conflict between op and her sil.", "I\u2019m definitely leaning one way\u2026to do it", "Lol, tell me?", "Haha thanks! I will think about that. My husband won\u2019t mind too much I hope lol", "I decided I\u2019m doing it. Life is too short! Just figuring some stuff out with it", "Omg I do have boots. You are giving me ideas, are you a good or bad influence, lol", "I think we found the SIL.\n\nOP, NTA.", "\u201cLike a hooker\u201d ??? MA\u2019AM lmao just say you\u2019re the sad jealous insecure sil and move on", "When did she EVER say she looked like a hooker?! Shame on you. Definitely found the jealous sister in law.  \n\nWho hurt you? Why you so angry?", "If you think it's a little much on its own, wear a comfortable jacket or shawl with it to tone the sexy down during dinner but giving you the chance to reveal the dress if you want AND showing your figure gracefully. If you add some sheer tights it'll give you the feel of being less on show too but accent your legs. A long necklace too can also make your dress less sexy club feel too", "I\u2019m a dude so it\u2019s completely understandable if you ignore my question if it makes no sense, but can you wear like a shawl or something over the dress if you\u2019re worried it\u2019s too much? That way you\u2019re wearing it for your husband, but not feeling uncomfortable. But definitely disregard your SIL\u2014she sounds jealous of you.", "Hhmm. In principle I **absolutely agree** with telling SIL to stick her dress policing up her ass - *however*, I would be mindful of the kind of restaurant it is, and that no-one wants a bird\u2019s eye view of a nipple-skimming deep V while eating dinner - or to see your underwear. \n\nSo my answer is ***it depends***.", "Hahaha you are evil, I love it", "Oooo pretty. You go girl. And throw in some fancy jewelry when you wear it your hubbies party, just to piss SIL off more", "I thought only the birthday person can wear white on their birthday.", "Then do it! If anyone says anything, tell them it was the birthday boy\u2019s request and leave it at that! Have a wonderful time!", "Someone very special in my life who has favorite outfits of mine or nail styles. Even hair dos. I think it\u2019s fun to wear whatever or have hair however", "If he protests, remind him that you're more likely to be affectionate if you aren't freezing your tail off!", "Both. The boots get my vote btw.", "You're the one who seems angry and unhinged, have some modesty and self respect", "Omg will you get my fashion advisor tonight? Seriously lol", "Yeah I think that makes sense. And dude advice is totally welcome as I make this decision!", "Oh brother. you CAN keep your eyes to yourself.", "Why would you be thinking about someone\u2019s nipple or underwear during dinner? Absolute f\u2019n weirdo", "Ok. Depends on\u2026?", "Haha. You\u2019re an awesome motivator!", "\ud83e\udd23 Its at birthday hubby's request, it's totally fine.", "That\u2019s so interesting! I want to hear more about this lol", "Hahah love that!", "Will you be my official advisor tonight? Lol", "You\u2019re making a big deal over nothing. Seek therapy for that condition of yours. Go clutch your pearls on another thread. You\u2019re making shit up. Insisted.. hooker.. no modesty.. things she never said\u2026 so basically you\u2019re saying if she would wear the dress to a club.. she still has no modesty.. who are you? Jill duggar?", "By reading your post history.. you\u2019re definitely the angry one around here. Bye angel", "Lol absolutely! I love fashion and clothing, I always help my friends for their dates and special dinners. Do you know what kind of shoes you want to wear? And dangle earrings can be excellent to show a long neck! With makeup, match colors to your accessories or focus to emphasis your eyes, your dress will stand out on its own", "Not every item of clothing is suitable for every occasion. \n\nAs I\u2019ve already said, it\u2019s up to OP to make that evaluation regarding her dress, the venue etc. If it\u2019s a formal restaurant, then a deep V neck that shows a lot of her breasts may not be suitable. She already thinks that the dress is a little much for his parents. So she needs to make the assessment of whether her dress is suitable or not, and also whether *she* is comfortable wearing it in that setting.", "On YOUR comfort. Don't stress about the pearl-clutching of others.", "I already said: the kind of restaurant it is, and exactly how low-cut and high-cut it is. And you already feel that it\u2019s a \u201clittle much\u201d around his parents - so it\u2019s your call to evaluate those factors and decide.", "Take a sweater/wrap for dinner and enjoy giving him sneak peaks while respecting his parents", "What your husband wants!", "on my part i **absolutely disagree** about that, its slut shaming. OP, why dont you tell your husband about that. And for me the ***it depends*** only apply to how **you** feel wearing this dress", "Lol thx, tho I gotta ask is the dress silk?", "lol, I wonder if he is still going to wear white?", "Lmao DM me if you\u2019d like!", "Lol I'll do what I can. Starting with wear the boots. \ud83d\ude09", "You're a very angry person I feel terrible for you, good luck", "Thank you! Very sweet.", "Her husband doesn\u2019t think so. It\u2019s his family and his bday. ??? They\u2019re married you know. That\u2019s what husband means.", "Respecting his parents? Please tell me how an article of clothing or showing cleavage is disrespectful. It\u2019s her body and she can show it if she pleases.", "Ha that\u2019s fun!", "He wants it, for sure!", "Thanks I think I feel good?", "Message me for a second if you\u2019re comfortable?", "Lol I\u2019d love to talk about this, I just tried but it didn\u2019t go through", "Message me if you\u2019re comfortable!", "Awwww. Bye Angel! Judging by your history of comments.. I\u2019m not the one with the problem toots!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Great that her husband shared his opinion and she\u2019s considering it. But she can decide for herself her own comfort level. She\u2019s an adult.", "Respectful in the sense that she's taking into consideration their feelings. Just wearing a low cut dress or any article of clothing isn't disrespectful in itself but choosing to wear something you know may make someone who you love (or someone important to who you love) uncomfortable is just being willfully inconsiderate, which is disrespectful", "That\u2019s what I meant!! I think people should wear whatever they want and people who body/victim shame women are the worst. I also think it\u2019s important to be aware of your audience. I take my kids to a play gym in a very conservative area and I made the mistake of wearing bike shorts and a low cut tank top once (it was hot!). No one said anything. Everyone was very considerate. But I felt rude standing next to the lady in the niqab. From what OP said she feels like this dress might make her feel the same way at this restaurant/with her in laws, and it\u2019s very fixable with the right accessories."]}
