I was put off by this - we don\u2019t get along well - and told her thanks, I\u2019ll think about it.

Surely, his family realizes that you and your husband sleep together \ud83d\ude06 I\u2019m sure if anyone raises an eyebrow over it husband will 100% be there to defend you. He sounds like he rather enjoys seeing you in that dress!", "NTA it's a party you're throwing for him.its his request. It's your dress and body. It not anyone else's business/decision.", "She doesn\u2019t want her husband looking at you is my take. And that due to her being jealous as well\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA, wear that little dress, make her jealous! You\u2019ll make your husband happy and her jealousy can be the cherry on top", "Tell your SIL that you are definitely wearing it, but not to worry; you found the same one for her in black, so the 2 of you will match perfectly.", "NTA but wear it for your husband not to spite your SIL \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Damn girl Wear The DRESS \ud83d\udc57 \ud83d\ude0d", "NTA if he requested it and you like the dress then wear it. Make sure he is willing to defend you if anyone says anything but if he would like to show you off then let him. SIL can suck it", "I\u2019m so tired of hearing about what people think about what others are wearing. It is your body. It is your choice what you wear if other people don\u2019t like it. F them you do you honey and I\u2019ll do me and everyone else that don\u2019t like it can F off", "NTA\n\nIf your husband likes it and you like it, then wear it.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable then don't, but your decision is yours", "Who\u2019s more important to you?", "NTA it\u2019s your husbands request for his bday is use that as justification alone\n\nEdit: I\u2019d tell him abt his sisters pestering just so he\u2019s aware", "NTA. Your hubby is making a special request for you to dress it up for, I'd go for and screw the SIL.\n\nHowever, if you do feel a bit self-conscious about it, wear a nice lacy shawl with it if it pairs nicely with one.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you. If you want to honor his request, do so. Make it spicy for him and make him happy, especially if making him happy also makes you happy.", "NTA\n\nStrut. That. Shit.\n\nYour SIL is being a downer. Your husband wants to see you in that dress!!! If you are 100% alright with it, do it. No one is stopping you.", "NTA\n\nCelebrate your husband! Guys don\u2019t get that kind of treatment often. If he wants to see you in a hot dress, show that off! Be proud! His opinion matters more than anyone else at that party!", "You should tell your husband and let him know the noisiness of that lady. Also, you should wear it with confidence.", "How did the brothers wife find out about the dress? Not sure we are getting the whole story here.\n\nHaving said that. Why do you care what SIL thinks about what you wear? \ud83e\udd14 too much girl drama going on here that isn't being said.", "NTA. Wear whatever the hell you want!", "NTA - if theyre gonna look at you give em a show! Nah but, do what YOU want, the question is had the sil not discouraged you from this, would you still have felt iffy about wearing it around his family? or was it BECAUSE of her, that brought doubt into ur mind to wear it?", "NTA - you should totally wear it!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust ignore her. Her jealous< and insecurity is none of your business. Ignore her drama, she MASSIVELY overstepping.\n\nYou want to wear it, youer huusband enjoys when you wear it .. no more reason needed to wear it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\". She\u2019s texted me again, asking if I\u2019m wearing it, \" .. As for her, just ignore the text and don't answer it. It is NONE of her business.", "Stop engaging with your SIL, for Pete\u2019s sake", "NTA!!!!! Rock the shit out of that dress!!!! Hubby is lucky to have you", "NTA. He asked. He matters. The others don\u2019t!", "Your hubbie matters, not the beatch who wears little house on the prairie dresses up to her neck. If u wanna look sexy for your man, go for it!", "NTA. Wear it and rock that dress. Sil is probably jealous.", "You wouldn't be the AH, if your husband asked you to wear the dress and most important you like the dress, and you feel pretty wearing it, just do it", "NTA-\nYour husband requested it. If SiL has an issue. That's SiLs issue \nHave fun!", "NTA. Wear it.", "The time in your life when you can wear that hot dress and make other women mad is a relatively small part of your life.  Wear a hot dress every goddamn day if you can.  I know I would.  NTA", "NTA, but if you want to keep the peace, is there something you can wear with it that would tone it down? A shrug, a cardigan, opaque tights, a blazer? Something so he can still see it and think about seeing you in just that later, but it won't scandalize family so much?\n\nOf course you're completely within your rights to wear it with heels and nothing else, but this would probably help family chill out and help you not feel self conscious.", "NTA. \n\nWear what you want. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/U9BwWKXjVaI", "Wear the dress! Enjoy yourself and screw what that debbie downer SIL thinks.  Please update us", "NTA...yes you definitely should wear it now! Who gives her standing to tell you what to wear?", "What is your husband's response to SIL texts? I'd wear it because it's his birthday and it's a special request. Make sure he's aware of the comments and wear it. If she gives any lip, he can send her on her way or tell her not to come. It's not about her afterall.", "Just curious, if the party is in a room at a restaurant what took 'a lot of planning'?\n\nInvites, maybe a cake, a present?  What am I missing.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband asked you to wear that dress. If you like it and it makes you feel good, wear it. If your sil doesn't like it, that's her problem. When you see her, say \"I know you told me not to wear this, but Husband requested it,\" and make sure Husband hears.", "NtA. Wear it with a cardigan and some sheer tights. Or thigh highs. He requested it for his birthday", "NTA\nShe sounds jealous please wear that dress", "NTA\n\nWear the dress. Your SIL is an inappropriate, disrespectful AH!\n\nPersonally, because I am petty, I wouldn't just wear the dress. I would also find a nice bif bow and shiny ribbon to wear with it! Then when anyone asks, the response is, \"He gets to unwrap me later! It's his birthday wish!\"!!! \ud83d\ude09", "Let\u2019s see the dress OP", "Just wear the sexy dress", "NTA. Why are you even discussing the clothes you\u2019re wearing to your husband\u2019s birthday with her? It\u2019s not any of her business.", "NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nYour husband requested this dress, so you should wear it. If you are comfortable wearing it.    \n\nIt's none of his brother's wife's business.", "Wear the  dress!! One day you will be over 60 like me and not have the figure anymore and you will wish that you did !!", "You could throw a lil jacket on if you feel like it's a bit to scandalous for the fam but at the end of the day whatever makes you comfortable", "I thought of the Chief and Keiko too! \u2764\ufe0f", "Hi! Thanks! He is.", "Yes! I\u2019m gonna!", "Hell yes. \ud83d\ude08", "Thanks! I\u2019m doing it!", "It\u2019s appropriate, but on the edge, I\u2019d say.", "Just got dressed!", "Perfect answer! I will!", "He does!", "Done deal!", "Will do!", "Doing it!", "I\u2019m doing it!", "His bro asked what we were wearing, so they would have an idea what to wear.", "Hard to say. I think she planted doubts!", "I will!", "I took pics!", "Haha! Will you be my coach? Lol", "NTA", "If I'm your husband, I'd be pissed if you don't wear it. Just wear it.", "Why the fuck is it any of her business what you wear to your own husband's birthday party, especially seeing as how he has requested it and you don't have a problem with it. Do ask her why she's trying to police what you wear, and what else in your life she thinks you should change. Ask her for a written list, for her to bring it with her, then don't read it and rip it up in front of her and everyone else at the party.", "If she's really clutching her pearls that badly about it and you want her there, wear the dress and keep some accessories around. Maybe have a cute matching shrug on when you greet her or something, just to vaguely up the modesty at first so she knows you're trying, then ditch it later on when she's settled.", "His brother's wife, especially.\n\nYeah. I'm evil.", "And rock it! Have fun!", "If I could bottle it up, I'd ship it off to you for free.", "Have a great night!", "Can you post a comparable pic? I would say if it\u2019s on the edge, I would lean towards not wearing it to dinner, then after dinner, change after the family leaves and take him out wearing that dress for like, a nightcap or something that\u2019s just the 2 of you.", "then she can royally fuck off.", "Done!", "Good thought!", "Oooooh. Lol, you\u2019re good.", "Message me if you\u2019re comfortable! So many questions", "I will! I feel hot!

I want to know her reaction when she sees you in the dress\ud83d\ude09", "If he doesn\u2019t mind around his parents then you certainly don\u2019t have to! Wear it, yolo!", "I\u2019m so happy for you\u2026and your husband! Have so much fun and ignore that SIL.", "Go slay, OP!", "It's a nice restaurant? They should know how to dress? Still finding it odd. \"Oh yeah big bro, my wife is wearing the skimpy white number with the gams all out.\" Bro says nice and tells his wife \"hey SIL is going to look like a real hot piece at dinner, FYI.\" Her head explodes because why does her husband care what you're wearing?\n\nIf this is really how these men communicate, that is strange. My partner has an older brother. My wardrobe has never been a point of their discussion.", "I'd love to, but have a commitment now.\n\nI hope you have a brilliant time!!", "Omg yaaas!!!! I would kill to see you!", "Some good advice here.", "that's what I'm thinking.", "I just took a ton of pics. I\u2019m ready to go!", "Thank you! Just got dressed. Going for it!", "I will!", "Ha, message me if you want!", "Sheer tights or hose with the line down the back are elegant and sexy.", "Another thought.  If you think your dress might be offensive to your husband's parents, you might want to approach them and say \"I realize you might think this dress is a bit much, but it's husband-name's favorite dress of mine and he asked me to wear it.  Since it's his birthday, I couldn't say no.\"", "How does saying attires that shows your nipple or underwear is inappropriate for family functions make him a f'n weirdo? Where is this coming from?", "Love that!", "I could do that! Totally!", "Her \ud83d\ude01", "I have no idea why you are being shit on for this very reasonable take.", "By the downvotes, I'm assuming this sub thinks all forms of attire is appropriate and saying otherwise is slut shaming? Jeeze, this sub has really gone off the rails.", "This is such a wholesome Reddit moment! Op, sounds like she\u2019s jealous in a really bizarre way. I cannot imagine badgering someone about what they\u2019re wearing to an event they\u2019re throwing. So weird. Wear what makes you happy, and if that happens to be the outfit that will make your husband happy on his birthday, double win!", "I\u2019m doing it!"]}
