Perhaps he\u2019s switched his addiction from substances to trauma, or to hyper fixating on his time there. Perhaps he feels like your family credits his sobriety more on the program than on his effort to actively chose not to use.

Yesterday would have been his 33rd birthday. Addiction is hard.  It's hard for the addict and it is hard for the family.  Your family may do something that does \"force\" him to get clean, but he is still allowed to resent however negative your actions made him feel. \n\nFirstly, forcing someone to do anything is going to lead to resentment, even if it is for their own good. \rYou don't know how rehab was for him, saying it was an extreme facility, and he isn\u2019t going to fully understand what it was like to be the family member watching him kill himself with drugs.

He was effectively isolated and shamed.  Even being effective, this STILL will cause some kind of resentment.  \n\nHonestly, with him being clean, he deserves some empathy for drastic measures.  Drug addiction is full of shame and trauma, so at the very least he might be looking for someone to even acknowledge that forcing him to go to his \"own funeral\" was fucked up, even if it was effective. It won't kill you to have a bit of empathy for the situation, or to at least admit that must have been hard for him? \n\n  \n\r\r\n\n**TLDR;** regardless of how effective it was, you all seem to be focusing on how hard it was for *you* and completely invalidating your brothers feelings after the experience.

And so is church and so is having a strong family unit. Yet trauma happens in all of these places sometimes. Questionable methods are used, people make mistakes in influencing other peoples lives.

That\u2019s just how life is anywhere so why would it be perfect in every rehab center?", "Being institutionalized or put into rehab is always supposed to be a \"healing\" experience but for a lot of people unless it's a particularly expensive facility intended for wealthy people it can be traumatic as hell. People are often mistreated, shamed, and sometimes abused. The goal is to \"heal\" you but if we're being honest about it the goal is to make you stop being a problem to others first and foremost.

Nobody else know how serious that is until they are in the middle of the discussion and so nobody know what is/isn't appropriate responses.\n\nI think it could be healthy to let him vent in a time and place where everyone is expecting it BUT he needs to allow for you to all respond.
