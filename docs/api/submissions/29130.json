Perhaps he\u2019s switched his addiction from substances to trauma, or to hyper fixating on his time there. Perhaps he feels like your family credits his sobriety more on the program than on his effort to actively chose not to use.

Yesterday would have been his 33rd birthday. Addiction is hard.  It's hard for the addict and it is hard for the family.  Your family may do something that does \"force\" him to get clean, but he is still allowed to resent however negative your actions made him feel. \n\nFirstly, forcing someone to do anything is going to lead to resentment, even if it is for their own good. \rYou don't know how rehab was for him, saying it was an extreme facility, and he isn\u2019t going to fully understand what it was like to be the family member watching him kill himself with drugs.

He was effectively isolated and shamed.  Even being effective, this STILL will cause some kind of resentment.  \n\nHonestly, with him being clean, he deserves some empathy for drastic measures.  Drug addiction is full of shame and trauma, so at the very least he might be looking for someone to even acknowledge that forcing him to go to his \"own funeral\" was fucked up, even if it was effective. It won't kill you to have a bit of empathy for the situation, or to at least admit that must have been hard for him? \n\n  \n\r\r\n\n**TLDR;** regardless of how effective it was, you all seem to be focusing on how hard it was for *you* and completely invalidating your brothers feelings after the experience.
