(I admit this may have come off as a bit rude).\n\nLater on as I was eating I decided to turn on the radio I had brought with me. I didn't have it very loud at all as I was sitting right next to it but almost immediately the wife came over asking me to turn it down.

I was pretty pissed off at this point.\n\nI eventually decide to go to sleep, and wouldn't you know it this lady's tiny white crusty dog is yapping away at something. I peek out of my tent and there she is letting her dog shit on my campsite unattended. Of course she didn't pick it up. Half an hour later the dog is still fucking barking (off leash might I add, which is against the rules) so I call the office with a noise complaint. Apparently I was not the first.\n\nThe next morning the man and his wife are packing up. As soon as he spots me he comes running over and cussing me out, saying I'm a dick for getting them kicked out of the campground.

Their own actions resulted in their punishment. All you did was advocate for yourself, and it sounds like you weren't the only one who complained.", "NTA. \n\nwho goes camping knowing they can't set up by themselves? Get a smaller camper or rent a cabin. Not following the rules and having a dog off leash no matter how they act at home, can cause a multitude of problems. Like someone getting bitten, the dog getting caught somewhere, barking and causing problems, not picking up after your dog someone steps in it, etc.", "NTA. They were super entitled and thought they owned the place. They should get a cabin if they want their own space, and you were completely allowed to refuse to help them, and to have your radio on. They were trying to enforce a noise rule that they weren't respecting, and the fact that she let her dog shit on your campsite is frankly fucking disgusting. Good for you for reporting them OP.", "NTA. You didn't get them kicked out, their behaviour did.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re good. They seemed entitled, and you seemed to react very reasonably.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you were solely responsible for getting them kicked out. Could you have been a little less standoffish in talking to them? Probably. Would it have made a difference? Probably not. It amazes me that they thought they could conscript some stranger trying to enjoy their own camping trip into setting up their site for them.", "NTA.  Just because you are sleeping outside doesn't mean your neighbors can disturb you with a yappy dog.", "NTA, you were polite enough but kept your boundaries when they first talked to you and reported them for going against camp rules. They got themselves kicked out imo, not you.", "NTA, I have no words for these people.", "NTA\n\nThey were entitled dicks who got what they deserved.\n\nThey should have booked a cabin and a kennel.", "NTA. I'm pretty sure that one noise complaint didn't get them kicked out, there had to be several.  Any way the trash took its self out and you got to at least enjoy the rest of your time there.", "NTA\n\nRules are rules and are set for everyone. They got kicked out because they didn't respect them.", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to decline when asked a favour. You\u2019re also allowed to insist on a peaceful breakaway and be left alone.\nIt sounds like they were pretty awful and spiteful people, literally curbing anything you might enjoy (radio, dog shit, dog barking). Honestly, I don\u2019t think it was ONLY your complaint that had them kicked off, there were a few as you said and more than one complaint set it in motion.", "Nta they broke the camp rules", "NTA, and I agree with you that if they can't set up a campground on their own, they should consider renting a cabin.", "NTA about filing the noise complaint. Your previous experience with them indicated that they would not be open to a conversation about the dog, so I can\u2019t fault you for not talking to them about that.\n\nYou are, however, TA for eating in your tent. This draws bears, even in busy campsites, and acclimated them to humans being a source of food. I know lots of people are careless about their food storage in front country camping, but please don\u2019t.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
