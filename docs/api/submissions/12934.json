This is a major purchase and huge decision that you both need to make together. Everything you said is spot on. Don\u2019t let them steamroll you. A backyard would be a deal breaker for me. If there are problems with the house it will only cause problems in the family", "NTA, If your mom likes it so much she can buy it and rent it out. Its really weird that she would be offended that you don't want to live in a place that does not meet your needs.", "Oh Lordt, don't buy a house you don't want and haven't actually seen inside or had inspected. Your MIL is crossing a big boundary here. NTA.", "NTA and I think you know it.", "NTA\n\nA house purchase is usually the largest financial investment you'll ever make. And you live in that investment. Don't buy something you don't like!", "NTA You let her make this choice she'll be doing it forever. Establish boundaries now before it's too late.", "NTA. Your MIL doesn't get to decide where you live. Even if she bought you a house, you don't have to live there.", "NTA you should talk to your wife about how you feel ..buying ahouse is a great purchase you should BOTH have a say in it. You don't want to buy that house then dont waste your money in it if it doesnt fullfil your needs. You should both say YES to one house...not just one of you feelling comfortable to make someone else outside the marriage feel happy. It is your choice and only yours not your MIL not someome elses. Dont buy that house.", "NTA - The house doesn't meet your needs.  Not even for a couple of years.  You want a forever home.   Get a realtor and set up some viewing for your and your spouse to see what you can get.  Spouse needs to see it.", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to help you but in an extremely controlling way. This could lead to more entitled behaviors from her in the future (like when you go to sell the house or do renos). \n\nPotential silver lining (cause I'm an optimist) if the house is in your name you could flip it and sell it for a profit or get renters and make some extra moola for you to buy your own house.", "NTA. You have way bigger problems than a boundary stomping MIL if your wife isn't backing you up.  After telling MIL directly (since you can't trust your wife to do so) and in no uncertain terms that the house doesn't work and further you will be selecting your own home to live in. Then let MIL do whatever the hell she wants since she can't sign a check from you nor physically force you to move, and get your cord-stricken wife in counseling with you pronto.", "NTA. MIL needs to back off. That's a massive red flag.", "NTA  \na house is big decision and should be thought out seriously, not bought on a whim because the MIL who isn't involved in the move is board.", "NTA Who\u2019s to say in 2-3 years you aren\u2019t stuck there or your MIL decides on your next house, why doesn\u2019t she also decide if and when you have kids and their names. You need to talk to your wife and discuss that you married her not her MIL. You are both entitled to decide on issues affecting your relationship especially such large things as your house.", "NTA \nYour MIL cannot force you into buying a house you don't want. It's your money and your life. Your wife needs to realize this is a mutual choice between you two as a couple and her mother needs to butt out. The MIL just making a deal without you even seeing the house is overstepping big time. You need set firm boundaries with your MIL in regards to making such huge decisions without your input. Your wife and you need to sit down and have a serious talk about what you both want in your new home. Your dogs are part of your family and should definitely be considered in the decision.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your MIL telling you about a house that\u2019s available. However that\u2019s where her involvement should end. The decision is for you and your wife to make and you should remind your wife of that.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your wife crumbling to her domineering mother?\n\nIf the house isn't suitable it isn't suitable. End of conversation. MIL loves the place so much she can buy it!\n\nThis is a hill to die on, a house is a massive investment and if you do buy it you'll be miserable, resent your wife and her family and end up divorced.", "NTA.", "What is the housing market like where you live? You said you've put in offers, what happened to them? I assume they were rejected since your wife said she \"didn't want them anyway\". How long have you been looking for a house? I think a lot of these judgments are being hasty and not considering other factors that might be at play. Are there ACTUALLY other options for buying a house right now, and if not, would you and your wife rather continue renting from her mom or buy a house that isn't perfect?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

MIL probably means well, but this is for you and your wife to decide between you.", "NTA. You should be looking together and find something you both like. Not your MIL's choice at all.", "NTA\n\nFrankly I'm surprised your wife doesn't want more say in the choosing of her house either, unless she's simply overwhelmed by the whole process. Moving between rental properties is massive and stressful enough, adding in the logistical/legal/financial headache of homeownership and transferring property is orders of magnitude worse. I'd stick to your guns and get your own place.", "NTA- your choice of house is none of her business unless she is paying for it. No thanks, that house doesn\u2019t work for us- is all you need to say. Keep repeating.", "You are right, and all of your reasons are on point.\n\nSomething i wrong with this MIL thing. She pushes in--already no good--and picks a completely unsuitable place. Worse, your wife is gung ho about it.\n\nDon't even discuss it. It's wholly unsuitable and MIL is the worst realtor since the Amityville horror.", "NTA. Is there a reason MIL wants you out of her rental?", "NTA. The details of the house don't actually matter. The problem is that your MIL is trying to run your lives and your wife is unwilling to say \"No\" to her. If she can't say \"We want to choose our own house,\" what's going to happen when MIL decides it's time for you to have children? Is your wife going to get pregnant just to make her mom happy?\n\nYou and wife need to work through this *now*, before you make any major life decisions. Otherwise MIL is going to be running your marriage forever.", "NTA", "right?!", "thank you. exactly. we saw a few houses that are beautiful perfect for us. we placed offers and my wife all of a sudden \u201cdidn\u2019t want them anyway\u201d then she tells me about my mil and the house she wants us to buy. amd now this is where i am \ud83d\ude2d", "the housing market is around $350k -$450k (3bd 2ba with 0.5-3 acres depending on the home). we are approved for 470k. \n\nthe house MIL wants us to be in is $325k (what her friend is offering since she is good friends) it is 3bd 1.5 ba.\n\nthe offers fell through because me and wife aren\u2019t on the same page. i want this decision to be 100% mutual. \n\nwe aren\u2019t in a rush to move because we have until Aug 2023 anyway and we have all our stuff ready to move. \n\nbackstory? well my wife was stationed in CA, her mom did not visit her during the 4 years she served. we visited twice after we got married. 2021 MIL stopped talking to us because wife brought up that she was upset that she didn\u2019t visit all that time. \n\nmy MIL is a millionaire. money not an issue. she is not retired but she has loads of free time. \n\nshe started talking to my wife again in summer 2022. there\u2019s obviously more and more family issues but that\u2019s the most recent i guess.\n\nshe\u2019s never been disrespectful or anything to me. she passed down her wedding ring to me. and i don\u2019t have an issue with her, just this house shit.", "I don't know if this if the first time you have bought a house with a partner or not but it's like launching missiles on a submarine. You both have to turn your keys. When my wife and I were looking for our first home together we took our time and looked for ones we both would agree on. We each had veto, she would see one and fall in love and I would find issues, then I would find one and fall in love and she would veto. It did cause some hurt feelings but we knew there would be one that would be perfect. It did not help matters that we live in Denver and the markets were nuts then but eventually we did find that gem. We found one we both loved and were able to make a winning offer. So what I am saying is don't give up till you are both happy.", "Time for a big conversation and to stand your ground.  Otherwise next MIL will tell you how to decorate it, when you can move, etc.  A house should only be the decision of the people buying it.", "i have this inkling that she doesn\u2019t want to lose her relationship with her mom again and is just doing everything she says to make her happy", "So you withdrew the offers?", "thank you! this gives me some more faith :)", "Your wife is letting you down. She is downgrading your importance as a husband, decision-maker and co-owner to chase her mother's approval. It's wrong, it's dysfunctional, and it's an insult to your marriage. This isn't letting her mommy choose a restaurant, or a vacation destination, or a guest room paint color. Stand firm. Do not agree to buy a house you don't want. Consider couples counseling if your wife cannot understand what an insanely unreasonable demand she is making of you.", "yes"]}
