I refused for a few months and got a lot of hate from his family for being \u201cstingy\u201d. Finally I was suppose to visit my family for a week and didn\u2019t need my car anymore and let him take it. I made him promise he wouldn\u2019t damage it and even added him to my insurance for a month which cost $200 and he refused to pay for saying it was unnecessary. \n\nHe didn\u2019t tell me at all but when I got back I noticed a deep dent in the bumper. He denied it saying I damaged it until I showed them the before photos I took of the car. He finally admitted he dented it when he was parking it in his parents garage. I was pissed and went to the mechanics to get a quote to repairs. \n\nThey quoted me $760 which I showed him and demanded he fix it. He said it was only a small dent and barely noticeable. To me it was very noticeable and it\u2019s was a brand new car only have 6,000 miles on it. I demanded he fix it and he called me a child and said I was getting angry over a tiny bump and he wouldn\u2019t fix it. He refused to pay for it and I couldn\u2019t leave until the lease was up. \n\nOver the next month I begged, tried to talk to him nicely and otherwise told him he had to pay for the repairs to my car. He just laughed and told me it wasn\u2019t his problem and to use the insurance policy to fix it. But I\u2019ve figured out they will increase my insurance so that the insurance company will charge me more than the cost of fixing the damage out of pocket. \n\nI was so pissed and I posted his ps5 for sale online. I sold it when he wasn\u2019t around and got $500 for it which wasn\u2019t enough for the bumper but as close as I was going to get. He came back and I told him I had sold it which led to a screaming match. He accused me of stealing from him and I accused him of breaking my stuff and refusing to fix it. I still had to pay almost $200 out of pocket as well as $200 because he used my car and he didn\u2019t even give a shit that he damaged it.", "created_utc": 1673044989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1057zsg/aita_for_making_my_bf_pay_for_the_damage_on_my_car/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a major sign of an entitled, selfish, inconsiderate brat. Not only would I take his sorry arse to small claims court, but  you already sold his stuff online so that may not be necessary... but ,  I would also dump him and never look back. This not just an issue about this vehicle. This is him showing you who he is and what he thinks of you, and how little respect and consideration or honesty he is willing to put out. Any good and decent person would have not harassed you about wanting to drive your vehicle, then when you allow it they would not hide that they damaged it and then refuse to pay for their damages. Get rid of this punk and find a real man.", "NTA. He damaged your car, lied about it, refused to pay for repairs, and belittled you in the process. There\u2019s no justification for any of that. None. I\u2019m gonna get downvoted, but I think you were right to sell the ps5. When people have debts they can\u2019t/won\u2019t pay, their property is seized and liquidated. You didn\u2019t do anything vengeful or for a profit, you simply wanted to get back money owed to you. You even took a loss on the deal. Watch out for your property though. Your boyfriend sounds like a total weasel who would be vengeful with your stuff.\n\nEdited for typo.", "NTA  but your bf & apparently his family are too.  They pressured  you to let him use your car?!?  That's insane, but seems to go right along with his behavior of refusing to pay for the damage.  And if he was a decent human being paying for the 200 for extra insurance would be the right thing.  Now, generally, I wouldn't say selling someone else's property is appropriate, but in this scenario, it seems justified. Too bad it didn't totally cover the cost, but it's way better than nothing.   Are you sure you want to be in a relationship with someone like this?", "NTA he got what he deserved and you should break up.", "NTA - I really hope you\u2019re not staying with this clown", "YTA for still referring to him as your boyfriend. y'all dysfunctional as...", "NTA for wanting him to pay. YTA for selling his gaming console, but I love the ingenuity and pettiness of it all. Drop that loser,he is cheap, irresponsible and a liar.", "NTA but you should have broken up with them, then sued him.", "NTA and he should be your ex by now", "You should dump this loser", "Holy crap you should have broken up a long time ago. NTA but good luck with the inevitable visit to small claims court", "ESH but him more than you for sure. Break up and move on from this whole mess .", "ESG. You should've NOT let him take the car after he refused to pay you back for insuring him. Sorry you have to fix your car somehow and the ps5 was the fix, but that really isn't right per se (I don't feel sorry for him though)", "Esh posts like these make me appreciate my relationship.", "\"He denied it saying I damaged it\" - damn...he's a gas lighter as well as the actual asshole. And his family called you stingy for not letting him use your car?  You aren't married...that's some really manipulative relations there.  Toxic situation all around.\n\nIt wasn't right of you to take his property and sell it, turn-about does not legally = fair play.  ESH.\n\nToo many red flags to count. Run.", "ESH\n\n1) Your BF sucks for well everything you said\n\n2) You sold his property which whilst probs justified not really cool at the same time\n\n3) Him for his attitude\n\n4) You for still considering him your BF and not running away when he started this shit", "ESH, your boyfriend much more so. It's common knowledge that if you damaged someone else's property you should pay them back or fix it. So he's obviously in the wrong. YTA for burying the lede in your title. You sold his PS5 which is his property.", "ESH - He is an AH but you behaved like a child as well. You have far more mature options available to you than to sell his possessions.", "ESH. So hard. \n\nHe's the kind of \"boyfriend\" who pressures you (bad), pulls his family into it (bad), damages your car and lies to you about it (bad), and refuses for months to do anything about it other than call you names and gaslight you (bad).\n\nYou clearly have weird boundaries (you didn't have to give in), you gave it with so little trust that you took before pictures (what does this say about your relationship that you thought this would happen?), you \"figured\" but didn't research and get confirmation that insurance wouldn't cover it or it would go up (bad, why are you causing more problems for yourself?) and then you sneak-steal-sell his PS5 as the consequence he deserves (bad! You don't get to do that! That's stealing even if you feel you're owed!) and you're still calling him your boyfriend?\n\nUgh.", "ESH. To be fair, he's a major AH and you're just a creative problem-solving AH. You already knew he couldn't be trusted with your car and should have stood your ground rather than letting his family's taunts get to you (I don't see any of them driving down the mountain to pick this loser up). He shouldn't have lied to you about the car and should pay for the repair. You shouldn't steal his things, which is what you did. You SHOULD break up with him, so at least you're doing that right. Good luck!", "Nta for asking him to pay. \n\nYta for stealing his ps5.  \n\n2 wrongs do not make a right. The right thing to do would have been to sue him for the money.", "NTA. Dump him.", "INFO: Why is he not an ex-boyfriend after all of this?", "NTA but ESH\n\nHe should 100% pay for the damage to the car, regardless of how noticeable it is.  He is being a total dick by not volunteering to pay for it immediately.\n\nStealing his ps5 and selling it is a little extreme though.", "ESH should have sued to make him pay instead of stealing his ps5 to cover part of the cost. Your relationship is toxic. He should pay for your damaged car, also you shouldn\u2019t let him use it since you would not trust him to take good care and take responsibility if something happened\u2026 also his family pressuring you to lend your care was already a big red flag.", "ESH but in a way I appluade you. You tried to do a nice thing and he took advantage of it. I think this is a deal breaker in your relationship and I wouldn't let him take the car again. You did steal the PS5 but sometimes I believe in fighting fire with fire.", "You are both A's lol.  I was with you 100% until you stole his PS5.  Obviously you need to dump this loser.   No one worth staying with dents their GF's car without immediately coming clean.  \n\nIf I was him I would have told you the bad news first thing, and already had a quote to show you and the repair appointment scheduled by the time you got back.", "NTA. Probably wasn\u2019t wise to sell the PS5, as legally, he could charge you with theft. Morally though, I don\u2019t have a problem with it. \n\nPlease talk to some experts in your area about keeping yourself safe. This guy does not sound awesome, OP", "ESH. Initially I would\u2019ve said to break up with him and take him to small claims court, but since you sold his PS5 I would just quit now.", "NTA for the pay but YTA for stealing his console and you do know he can file charges on you right?", "NTA. He lied to you, scoffed at your concern and the terms for using your vehicle and THEN had the nerve to call you childish?!?! Take him to small claims court and dump his entitled, spoiled brat-ass.", "ESH - Jesus both of you are toxic. DO NOT come here expecting sympathy. To be frank with you, this whole situation is gross. He fucked your car up but then you go decide to sell his shit?\n\nIf you guys are like 16/17, Don't take the asshole thing too seriously because you guys are young and dumb and in ten years when you're grown up, none of that matters.\n\nBut if you guys are grown adults, this is horrible. Just end the relationship because it doesn't sound like he respects you at all and you are willing to retaliate in just as dirty of a way.", "ESH. He\u2019s an ass for refusing to pay, you\u2019re an ass for stealing his console to pay for it, and you\u2019re all a giving like children.  Next time don\u2019t loan things to people unwilling to take the basic step of paying for the insurance they\u2019re legally required to have to drive.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure you mean ex-boyfriend. Right?", "I was so ready with a NTA, until that last paragraph.\n\nESH. Him for damaging your car and refusing to pay. I've watched enough Judge Judy and People's Court to know that.\n\nYou for selling his PS5 without his knowledge. That's theft! Doesn't matter your reasoning. You take him to court or do something else. You don't steal from someone just because they owe money. \n\nYou may be able to prove he damaged your car, but he can probably prove that you stole and sold his PS5. And that's just not affecting you two. It's affecting the person who bought it. You cared about no one but yourself. \n\nNeither of you get any sympathy from me.\n\nYou both need to grow up and not see each other again.", "ESH, your bf for the obvious  and you for him still being your bf and not your EX..he gives 0 fucks about you or your feelings and has no respect for you.", "Instead of stooping to his level, ya shoulda dumped him and took him to small claims. YTA\n\nIts obvious he's wrong. He big wrong. But instead of seeing the red flag you slapped those Rose colored glasses.on two fold, and doubled down. \n\nRidiculous from both of you honestly. Why would you stay with someone who not only is so rude, but also who was so quick to sick their family on you. \n\nYou really willing to deal with that the rest of your life?
