Not only would I take his sorry arse to small claims court, but  you already sold his stuff online so that may not be necessary... but ,  I would also dump him and never look back. This not just an issue about this vehicle. This is him showing you who he is and what he thinks of you, and how little respect and consideration or honesty he is willing to put out. Any good and decent person would have not harassed you about wanting to drive your vehicle, then when you allow it they would not hide that they damaged it and then refuse to pay for their damages. Get rid of this punk and find a real man.", "NTA. He damaged your car, lied about it, refused to pay for repairs, and belittled you in the process. There\u2019s no justification for any of that. None. I\u2019m gonna get downvoted, but I think you were right to sell the ps5. When people have debts they can\u2019t/won\u2019t pay, their property is seized and liquidated. You didn\u2019t do anything vengeful or for a profit, you simply wanted to get back money owed to you. You even took a loss on the deal. Watch out for your property though. Your boyfriend sounds like a total weasel who would be vengeful with your stuff.\n\nEdited for typo.", "NTA  but your bf & apparently his family are too.  They pressured  you to let him use your car?!?  That's insane, but seems to go right along with his behavior of refusing to pay for the damage.  And if he was a decent human being paying for the 200 for extra insurance would be the right thing.

So hard. \n\nHe's the kind of \"boyfriend\" who pressures you (bad), pulls his family into it (bad), damages your car and lies to you about it (bad), and refuses for months to do anything about it other than call you names and gaslight you (bad).\n\nYou clearly have weird boundaries (you didn't have to give in), you gave it with so little trust that you took before pictures (what does this say about your relationship that you thought this would happen?), you \"figured\" but didn't research and get confirmation that insurance wouldn't cover it or it would go up (bad, why are you causing more problems for yourself?) and then you sneak-steal-sell his PS5 as the consequence he deserves (bad!

To be fair, he's a major AH and you're just a creative problem-solving AH. You already knew he couldn't be trusted with your car and should have stood your ground rather than letting his family's taunts get to you (I don't see any of them driving down the mountain to pick this loser up). He shouldn't have lied to you about the car and should pay for the repair. You shouldn't steal his things, which is what you did. You SHOULD break up with him, so at least you're doing that right.

He should pay for your damaged car, also you shouldn\u2019t let him use it since you would not trust him to take good care and take responsibility if something happened\u2026 also his family pressuring you to lend your care was already a big red flag.", "ESH but in a way I appluade you. You tried to do a nice thing and he took advantage of it. I think this is a deal breaker in your relationship and I wouldn't let him take the car again. You did steal the PS5 but sometimes I believe in fighting fire with fire.", "You are both A's lol.  I was with you 100% until you stole his PS5.  Obviously you need to dump this loser.   No one worth staying with dents their GF's car without immediately coming clean.  \n\nIf I was him I would have told you the bad news first thing, and already had a quote to show you and the repair appointment scheduled by the time you got back.", "NTA. Probably wasn\u2019t wise to sell the PS5, as legally, he could charge you with theft. Morally though, I don\u2019t have a problem with it. \n\nPlease talk to some experts in your area about keeping yourself safe. This guy does not sound awesome, OP", "ESH. Initially I would\u2019ve said to break up with him and take him to small claims court, but since you sold his PS5 I would just quit now.", "NTA for the pay but YTA for stealing his console and you do know he can file charges on you right?", "NTA. He lied to you, scoffed at your concern and the terms for using your vehicle and THEN had the nerve to call you childish?!?! Take him to small claims court and dump his entitled, spoiled brat-ass.", "ESH - Jesus both of you are toxic. DO NOT come here expecting sympathy. To be frank with you, this whole situation is gross. He fucked your car up but then you go decide to sell his shit?\n\nIf you guys are like 16/17, Don't take the asshole thing too seriously because you guys are young and dumb and in ten years when you're grown up, none of that matters.\n\nBut if you guys are grown adults, this is horrible.

He\u2019s an ass for refusing to pay, you\u2019re an ass for stealing his console to pay for it, and you\u2019re all a giving like children.

Right?", "I was so ready with a NTA, until that last paragraph.\n\nESH. Him for damaging your car and refusing to pay. I've watched enough Judge Judy and People's Court to know that.\n\nYou for selling his PS5 without his knowledge. That's theft! Doesn't matter your reasoning. You take him to court or do something else. You don't steal from someone just because they owe money. \n\nYou may be able to prove he damaged your car, but he can probably prove that you stole and sold his PS5. And that's just not affecting you two. It's affecting the person who bought it. You cared about no one but yourself. \n\nNeither of you get any sympathy from me.\n\nYou both need to grow up and not see each other again.", "ESH, your bf for the obvious  and you for him still being your bf and not your EX..he gives 0 fucks about you or your feelings and has no respect for you.", "Instead of stooping to his level, ya shoulda dumped him and took him to small claims. YTA\n\nIts obvious he's wrong. He big wrong. But instead of seeing the red flag you slapped those Rose colored glasses.on two fold, and doubled down. \n\nRidiculous from both of you honestly.
