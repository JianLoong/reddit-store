Your dad has confirmed that she has been behaving the same with at least him since... well, how long have they known each other and when did they marry/divorce? At least temporarily, it might be time to tell her that because she won't respect perfectly normal boundaries, personally and directly sabotaged your career, and shows no remorse nor even ownership of her behaviour, you're going temporarily NC for your own sake and warn her that, depending on her behaviour, you may extend it or make it permanent. What reconciliation looks like is up to you. An apology to you and your dad (because of he got you the job, there's a likelihood she also caused some damage to his reputation with whoever his connection was there)? Attending therapy with you to work out whatever is behind her refusal to quit harassing you inappropriately? A move from NC to LC until she proves she's changed enough to have earned back an unfiltered place in your life? It's up to you, but you should think about it so you can talk about your conditions as part of the NC message (which should be sent by email/text/whatever, both so you have proof of what you said and so that you can temporarily filter her messages so you don't see them but they're recorded just in case) \n\nAdditionally, if she uses this to try and harass you at your dads or anywhere else, tell her you'll get the cops involved if it's at home, or give whoever's property you're on full freedom to call the cops on her for trespassing.", "NTA.

But piece of advice: people are saying go No Contact, but I don't think that is right. Get a letter from your boss stating why you were fired (your mother's behavior) and go get a restraining order. She straight up stalked you at your work and got you fired. That is definitely grounds for a restraining order", "NTA. I have always agreed with the philosophy of Guido the Killer Pimp in the movie Risky Business: [paraphrasing] \"you don't fuck with a person's livelihood.\"\n\nYour mother sounds more than a little bit unhinged, just for having a problem with you not doing a \"girly\" job. Other than sex work, most girly jobs pay a whole lot less than non-girly jobs, such as warehouse work and so many others. I'm also very furious with your boss for having fired you because of your mother's behavior. Next job, once you get started, mention to someone a few levels above you that your mother is problematic. You don't have to imply that she's dangerous or anything, but that she has a sense of urgency for every problem and is likely to come to visit you, regardless of how inappropriate it is. Tell them you don't like this, and would they please use security to block her at the door and send her away politely? I think this is doable. She just took you totally by surprise this past time, but now you know what to expect from her, so be prepared!\n[Edited] feel free to disregard everything I said after \"Next job.\" So many other people here have pointed out that your best strategy is to keep your mother completely in the dark about where you work. And they were also right in saying that most employers don't want to get in the middle of this. If you're old enough to work for them, you are old enough to deal with your mother without trying to build your own security service through the company. Good luck!", "NTA.  Mom was overbearing, engaged in unacceptable behavior over your objections, and got you fired.

If so contact a lawyer ASAP to sue your mom for her harassment and loss of employment(as well as get a restraining order). Not a lawyer, seek legal advise, but you should be able to sue your mom.", "NTA. Also, file for unemployment. Some people that don't understand the law will try to tell you that you were fired with cause, because your mother was making a scene. That is incorrect. You did not invite your mother, and I'm sure you told your employer this, so this was *their* problem to handle, not yours.

(I\u2019m only partway in to the comments right now.)", ">Also i am a girl and i know more about fixing cars than the average adult man (im under 18)\n\nI'm the average adult man. Just for the record: why do you think that I should know anything about fixing cars?", "And require the least amount of effort as well...", "This makes me wonder if OP can sue her mom for lost wages.", "You might say they got it explicitly right.", "If you're insane so am I. It's very much implied. But absolutely not explicit", "NTA, good idea asking them for money", "NTA\n\n\nBecome a stripper and ask if that's girly enough for her", "You have grounds for suing her for getting you fired.", "I'd file a restraining order against her from your place of employment.", "OP, you may need a restraining order. Just keep it in the back of your mind.\n\nDefinitely don't tell her anything about your next job, definitely warn your boss. Document everything in case this is the beginning of something ongoing.\n\nAnd no, kiddo, NTA. Our job as parents is to help you grow, and hard as it is, to let you spread your wings IN YOUR OWN WAY.", "No. Don't warn your future boss or you won't have a future boss!  That's a Red Hiring Flag if ever there was one!", "I'm confused as to why people were sticking up for mum in the first place. It's like a general rule at every type of workplace that you don't have friends family come to your work to hang out or have a chat. You are there to work.", "I love OP she\u2019s 18 and just EXUDING bad b*tch energy\n\nNTA and gurl your refusal to take shit is gonna serve you VERY well in male-dominated \u201cungirly\u201d jobs, don\u2019t ever change", "Unless OP had a preexisting restraining order against her mom when she was fired, there's no case here.", "Please, please do NOT tell future bosses, or they won\u2019t be future bosses. Nobody wants to hire someone who comes with a PITA relative who's going to cost them time and money. Most managers will not have a customer removed unless there are legal reasons in writing that make violating them more costly than a lawsuit by the customer. Without violation of some law or an RO, cops aren't going to show up. \n\nAFTER she's hired, if mom does come in and harass the OP, that's the time to enlist the sympathies of the manager. But if the OP is careful about whom she confides in, the mom may never know.", "I meant after they got hired.", "Why bother telling her anything?", "I wouldn't even tell her what town.... nor what field, nor any other information to give her anything to go on.", "My mom showed up to my jobs when I started because she was proud to ask her baby for a shake or whatever I was doing. I\u2019m at a daycare now and she shows up to read books. She\u2019s just proud of me. It\u2019s so weird thanksgiving parents willing hurt their kids. I asked my son if it was ok for me to embarrass him at drop off. He said \u201cdo your worst.\u201d I\u2019m still tryna come up with something. The boy is tough as nails. They keep laughing at me, lol.", "Then don't  interfere or ask for clarification  on the other side.  NtA  op", "Sounds like a bad boss actually.", "Totally agreed. I had to get my boss to tell my mom she wasn't allowed in my work anymore cause she'd show up for a ton of reasons but usually to 'talk' and that talk always ended up with her getting angry about something else in her life and loudly talking about it/crying about it at my job.", "That would still put you on the short list to get let go, or outright terminated anyway (at least in a right to work/at will state).", "LOL this just reminds me of when Ross went and brought Rachel a picnic to her work when she told him multiple times that she was BUSY and didn't have time to entertain him. And her coworker is all like, \"awww how romantic!!\"", "Yup agreed with that. OP needs to be prepared to file a restraining order and call the cops.", "Even if I agreed with any of that, which I absolutely do not, it wouldn't change how obnoxious it is to have a hissy fit because someone used a word a little bit wrong.  And you're obnoxious for thinking it's super cool and relatable be a pedantic prick.", "nta- just curious in what ways did they bug her? were they just being supportive(I don't know why) and saying you should just tolerate her or that she has the right to call? or where they filling her head with concerns that made her want to drop by?  I'm trying to understand how people were on board with this   what was she saying the reasoning was?", "Easy to take some photos there for social media.", "Who surprises people at work without clearing it ahead of time? People have important things to do.", "I told her to stop calling me 20-30 times a day and to never come by my work \"just to check up on me\". She cried and they said I was a bad person for being so mean to my poor mom who was just looking out for me.", "Only if OP posts it on social media."]}
