I was working in a warehouse and I was going to apprentice as a parts technician.  My dad helped me get the job.  My mom hates that I didn't have a girly job.  \n\nShe would constantly call and even showing up there.  I told her to please stop.  That my boss didn't like her interruptions of my day.  She would stop for a bit and then do it again.  \n\nI finally blew my top at her and told her to leave me the F alone at work. She went on Facebook and complained about how I was an ingrate for not wanting to see my mom.  \n\nA bunch of people started saying that I was being mean to my mom and that she meant well and that she wasn't hurting me.  \n\nLast week she showed up again.  She actually tried to come in the back when I would not come out to see her.  My boss was done.  I was fired. \n\nMy dad says he will help me get another job but I am pissed.  So I went on Facebook and found every person who had called me mean and that said she wasn't hurting me.  I spelled out why I got fired and I asked them to help me out with some money since her actions had cost me my job.  \n\nNow all of a sudden they are turning on her calling her overbearing and saying they didn't realize she was jeopardizing my employment.  But none have sent any money.  I don't really need it. I live with my dad and he says that as long as I'm in school or apprenticing I don't need to pay for anything except my phone.  \n\nMy mom keeps calling and texting me asking me to stop telling people that she got me fired.  And that I'm embarrassing her by asking the people who supported her for money. \n\nI think that I'm in the right for showing everyone who she is.  My dad says that he's staying out of it.

Seeing as she learned nothing from this, however, and even now is only contacting you to vent about what *you* (in her world) did to *her*, I gotta ask - have you considered going NC with her? She appears to be intent on continuing to cause you harm. Your dad has confirmed that she has been behaving the same with at least him since... well, how long have they known each other and when did they marry/divorce? At least temporarily, it might be time to tell her that because she won't respect perfectly normal boundaries, personally and directly sabotaged your career, and shows no remorse nor even ownership of her behaviour, you're going temporarily NC for your own sake and warn her that, depending on her behaviour, you may extend it or make it permanent. What reconciliation looks like is up to you. An apology to you and your dad (because of he got you the job, there's a likelihood she also caused some damage to his reputation with whoever his connection was there)? Attending therapy with you to work out whatever is behind her refusal to quit harassing you inappropriately? A move from NC to LC until she proves she's changed enough to have earned back an unfiltered place in your life? It's up to you, but you should think about it so you can talk about your conditions as part of the NC message (which should be sent by email/text/whatever, both so you have proof of what you said and so that you can temporarily filter her messages so you don't see them but they're recorded just in case) \n\nAdditionally, if she uses this to try and harass you at your dads or anywhere else, tell her you'll get the cops involved if it's at home, or give whoever's property you're on full freedom to call the cops on her for trespassing.", "NTA. You are SAVAGE! This is so great. Your mom deserves every bit of it.", "NTA.  Mom was wrong to interfere with your job. Since mom started the problem of people knowing by going on Facebook I can see why you used it to let the truth out.  \n\nRemind mom that you are 18, starting adult life and you need a job to make it. If she wants to be part of your life she has to respect your choices and cannot interfere. Remind her that she raised you to be an adult not a child.", "NTA and you might have a wrongful termination case as you did tell her to stop and she refused. You were fired for something out of your control.\n\nMight also want to look at a restraining order against your mother.

I would keep contacting each person - at the same rate she kept interrupting your job. \n\n\nAlso, ask each of them to get you a new job, Since they supported your mom getting you fired from this one.", "NTA - your Mom was out of line but why did she think it was appropriate to appear at your work?    That behavior is not appropriate and it did get you fired.  If she persists in such behavior, block her and get a restraining order.", "NTA -  good for you! These people enabled your moms harassment. in what world would your mother showing up at you job NOT endanger your job!", "NTA\n\nPlease do NOT tell her where you work the next time you get a job. It sounds like your mom has an issue with gender roles? Go low or no contact with her. Edit, I see you do live with your dad. Thank goodness.", "NTA, but you know you can\u2019t let your mom have any access to your social media or any information about where you are working in the future, right? Because she\u2019s going to do the exact same thing at the next place you work, and the one after that, and the one after that until the end of time.  Good luck, this is going to be a massive PITA to deal with.", "She got you fired. She was overbearing. Write a snail mail letter of apology to your former boss and accept your father\u2019s help to move on. Don\u2019t tell Mommy Dearest.", "Definitely NTA. But piece of advice: people are saying go No Contact, but I don't think that is right. Get a letter from your boss stating why you were fired (your mother's behavior) and go get a restraining order. She straight up stalked you at your work and got you fired. That is definitely grounds for a restraining order", "NTA. I have always agreed with the philosophy of Guido the Killer Pimp in the movie Risky Business: [paraphrasing] \"you don't fuck with a person's livelihood.\"\n\nYour mother sounds more than a little bit unhinged, just for having a problem with you not doing a \"girly\" job. Other than sex work, most girly jobs pay a whole lot less than non-girly jobs, such as warehouse work and so many others. I'm also very furious with your boss for having fired you because of your mother's behavior. Next job, once you get started, mention to someone a few levels above you that your mother is problematic. You don't have to imply that she's dangerous or anything, but that she has a sense of urgency for every problem and is likely to come to visit you, regardless of how inappropriate it is. Tell them you don't like this, and would they please use security to block her at the door and send her away politely? I think this is doable. She just took you totally by surprise this past time, but now you know what to expect from her, so be prepared!", "NTA.  Mom was overbearing, engaged in unacceptable behavior over your objections, and got you fired. Showing everyone who criticized you why they're wrong does not make you an AH.\n\nThat said, watch your tendency to be a bit extra.  If you don't keep this in check, you may end up more like your mom than you want to be.", "INFO: Why are you asking these people for money? Is it to make a point that they shouldn't get involved in your work if they're not going to pay you or because you're actually expecting money?", "INFO: Is there anyway your dad can help you get the job back since he helped you get it.", "NTA. Too cool the way you handled it, and you\u2019re fortunate that you have a sane parent in your dad.", "You. BOSS!\n\nNTA!", "NTA.  You made your point in a very classy way.

NTA", "NTA\n\nI live for this level of petty", "NTA.   serves her right for being embarrassed", "NTA.\n\nAnd that's genius, the busybodies who backed her were asked to put **their** money where their mouths were, and suddenly, they realise that her behaviour is out of pocket. \n\nShe will have learnt nothing, let her feel the shame, and keep the new job top secret.", "NTA, if she's embarrassed by what she did, she shouldn't have done it!", "Amusing & she deserves it...  NTA (next time, don't tell her where you work)", "She did get you fired.  Anyone she whined to deserves to know that.  And she deserves to know that when you get another job, you will not speak to her on the clock under any circumstances.  NTA", "I am impressed you handled this like a rockstar. Tell your mother if she does not leave you alone you will post that this is the stuff she would do to your dad and why he divorced her.", "NTA. Good darts for calling her out to everyone. She got her just desserts", "On one hand, it was not okay for your mother to constantly interrupt company time like that, especially after she disapproved of your work environment: that kind of behavior is uncalled for. However, I really don't believe that screaming at her (during work) was justified either, nor is asking for money when (in your own words) you don't necessarily need any. I hate to say it, but I see this as an \"Everybody Sucks\" scenario: you both are in the wrong, honestly.", "NTA in general but you are one for cyber-begging.", "NTA", "I'd love to see those flying monkeys eat their words now. \"She's your mom, she wasn't hurting you, she meant well.\"\n\nYeah I am sure OP's former boss *definitely* saw it that way.

Just like calling out family members for saying \"do this for a person because they're family\" but not stepping up themselves.", "Because they were the ones saying that I was being an asshole for telling my mother not to bother me at work.", "You honestly believe the overbearing mom that just got her daughter fired from her first job and then had the audacity to blast her wronged child on Facebook somehow sucks just as much as OP.\n\nCome on now.", "Nope. That's not what it is called. It is showing a target people how cheap their words are", "I live in an At Will state. There are still protections in place for wrongful termination.\n\nYour mother interfered with your ability to perform your job, you tried multiple times to correct her behavior and she refused, you were terminated for something you couldn't control.\n\nYour job should have filed a restraining order against her.", "That doesnt eliminate wrongful termination suits.", "Yeah that's why I asked if it was to make a point. I just thought 'But none have sent any money.' was a slightly odd comment so I wanted to clarify.
