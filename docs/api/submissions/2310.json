Your dad has confirmed that she has been behaving the same with at least him since... well, how long have they known each other and when did they marry/divorce? At least temporarily, it might be time to tell her that because she won't respect perfectly normal boundaries, personally and directly sabotaged your career, and shows no remorse nor even ownership of her behaviour, you're going temporarily NC for your own sake and warn her that, depending on her behaviour, you may extend it or make it permanent. What reconciliation looks like is up to you. An apology to you and your dad (because of he got you the job, there's a likelihood she also caused some damage to his reputation with whoever his connection was there)? Attending therapy with you to work out whatever is behind her refusal to quit harassing you inappropriately? A move from NC to LC until she proves she's changed enough to have earned back an unfiltered place in your life? It's up to you, but you should think about it so you can talk about your conditions as part of the NC message (which should be sent by email/text/whatever, both so you have proof of what you said and so that you can temporarily filter her messages so you don't see them but they're recorded just in case) \n\nAdditionally, if she uses this to try and harass you at your dads or anywhere else, tell her you'll get the cops involved if it's at home, or give whoever's property you're on full freedom to call the cops on her for trespassing.", "NTA.

But piece of advice: people are saying go No Contact, but I don't think that is right. Get a letter from your boss stating why you were fired (your mother's behavior) and go get a restraining order.

I have always agreed with the philosophy of Guido the Killer Pimp in the movie Risky Business: [paraphrasing] \"you don't fuck with a person's livelihood.\"\n\nYour mother sounds more than a little bit unhinged, just for having a problem with you not doing a \"girly\" job. Other than sex work, most girly jobs pay a whole lot less than non-girly jobs, such as warehouse work and so many others. I'm also very furious with your boss for having fired you because of your mother's behavior. Next job, once you get started, mention to someone a few levels above you that your mother is problematic. You don't have to imply that she's dangerous or anything, but that she has a sense of urgency for every problem and is likely to come to visit you, regardless of how inappropriate it is. Tell them you don't like this, and would they please use security to block her at the door and send her away politely? I think this is doable. She just took you totally by surprise this past time, but now you know what to expect from her, so be prepared!", "NTA.

If so contact a lawyer ASAP to sue your mom for her harassment and loss of employment(as well as get a restraining order). Not a lawyer, seek legal advise, but you should be able to sue your mom.", "NTA. Also, file for unemployment. Some people that don't understand the law will try to tell you that you were fired with cause, because your mother was making a scene. That is incorrect. You did not invite your mother, and I'm sure you told your employer this, so this was *their* problem to handle, not yours. They should've gotten a restraining order against your mother rather than punish you for something outside of your control.", "NTA and maybe an info diet for your mom?

First off, the money is basically a \"you insisted I should just put up with it, turns out you were wrong and shouldn't have condoned it, but since you're so invested put your money where your mouth is\" second off, how is OP in any way as bad as her mom?", "Why?  They are the ones who said her actions weren't harmful to me.

Logistics people don't have the time or the patience to play diplomatic corps. And it's outlined in most of their new hire guides and policies. Like, it's in the top 10 list if what will get you terminated immediately with zero write up and pretty iron clad for court purposes. (Worked in the warehouses where I'm at for years. The local teamsters union even has an arbitration clause surrounding that issue, because,  yeah, gambling town with all kind of domestic disturbance issues)", "That\u2019s not how it works.  Wrongful termination is against an employer.  The mother is responsible for her actions.  The mother harassed the employer, interfered with employees and their business.

The employer is not responsible for the harassment because it was her own mother not an employee or customer.", "why, is \"daughter of a crazy lady\" a constitutionally protected class?", "Don't think so, it's not really the boss's fault here.
