She throws a temper tantrum when she doesn\u2019t get her way, constantly guilt trips my boyfriend when he tries to do something she doesn\u2019t approve of and uses emotional manipulation to get way. My boyfriend constantly tries to create boundaries for himself, which he has a hard time doing before he met me, and his mother constantly ignores them and does what she wants because \u201cshe\u2019s his Mom and no one will tell Mom what to do or how to act.\u201d\n\nHis Mom also dislikes me. When asked why, all she says is because I\u2019m \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201chave no emotions and never try to be apart of the family.\u201d However, I always go to family events, engage in conversation when I\u2019m there, speak when spoken to and just try to be apart. I\u2019m just really shy and a very reserved person.

Clearly, no one in that family likes me and plans to never like me.

I tried being the \u201cbetter person\u201d for over a year with my bfs family, but they still hold their grudge. \n\nI told my bf I am not going but he can go without me. He said I\u2019m being unfair to him and that it\u2019s just \u201cone day\u201d and that I should go cause it\u2019s his family.
