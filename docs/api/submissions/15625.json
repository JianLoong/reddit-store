We\u2019ve been dating since last February. I met his family early on in the relationship and they at first seemed like nice people.\n\nAs time went on, turns out, his Mother is the exact opposite of nice. She\u2019s a narcissist. She throws a temper tantrum when she doesn\u2019t get her way, constantly guilt trips my boyfriend when he tries to do something she doesn\u2019t approve of and uses emotional manipulation to get way. My boyfriend constantly tries to create boundaries for himself, which he has a hard time doing before he met me, and his mother constantly ignores them and does what she wants because \u201cshe\u2019s his Mom and no one will tell Mom what to do or how to act.\u201d\n\nHis Mom also dislikes me. When asked why, all she says is because I\u2019m \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201chave no emotions and never try to be apart of the family.\u201d However, I always go to family events, engage in conversation when I\u2019m there, speak when spoken to and just try to be apart. I\u2019m just really shy and a very reserved person. I also have social anxiety, which my boyfriend\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t believe in.\n\nSo since my boyfriend\u2019s Mom hates me, so do both of my boyfriend\u2019s brothers. When asked the same reason, they just give the same reason as the Mom does. His older brother, Justin, has told my boyfriend that he does not like me and never will and his younger brother feels the same way. When asked to elaborate on their reasoning, they just say \u201cWe just don\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\nSo Justin\u2019s engagement party if coming up and I don\u2019t want to go. Clearly, no one in that family likes me and plans to never like me. Why should I go out of my way to be nice to them and go to family events and support Justin\u2019s relationship when he doesn\u2019t support me and my boyfriends? I tried being the \u201cbetter person\u201d for over a year with my bfs family, but they still hold their grudge. \n\nI told my bf I am not going but he can go without me. He said I\u2019m being unfair to him and that it\u2019s just \u201cone day\u201d and that I should go cause it\u2019s his family. Now he\u2019s mad at me. \n\nSo AITA for saying I\u2019m not going to his brother\u2019s engagement party?", "created_utc": 1682401712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12y9sf9/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_am_not_going_to/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not a good sign if he cannot properly set boundaries with his mother. There is nothing you can do if people simply don't like you. As far as the engagement party though, I would go even if to be a nuisance. Maybe I am a mean person, but I would rub my presence in their faces.", "NTA. Your boyfriend wouldn\u2019t know a boundary if he got smacked with an atlas.", "NTA - and I hate to say this... but run from this family.", "NTA\nIf he doesn't even like you, you wouldn't be celebrating for him,  you'd probably just feel uncomfortable and possibly a bit unwelcome.\nIt's understandable your boyfriend wants you to come but he may not understand how toxic the whole situation with his family is if he's not even acknowledging how they talk to you or about you", "So, BF's entire family dislikes you for some reason. \n\nWhy on earth would you go to an engagement party for someone that dislikes you? Or any party? \n\nI think BF needs to see this thread when you get more comments. Most all are going to say the same thing.", "NTA, but I disagree with the other commenters that you should leave your bf. Reddit loves telling people to break up. His family sucks, and he doesn't need to drag you into it, but I'd hope he can learn that. \"I'm not going to spend time with people who say they don't like me, even if they're your family.\"", "NTA - your protecting your space, if they\u2019ve said they do not like you then why would you go?\n\nIf the boyfriend is accepting these behaviours he\u2019s the AH", "NTA you don't have to go if you don't want to and you aren't telling him he *can't* go, so I don't see the problem. Of course, living this situation myself, I'd go just to prove a point. Be nice, pleasant, cordial without being a doormat, and prove that they're all just prejudiced idiots. If it were *just* the family members that hated me, well, they can go chew rocks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
