I met his family early on in the relationship and they at first seemed like nice people.\n\nAs time went on, turns out, his Mother is the exact opposite of nice. She\u2019s a narcissist. She throws a temper tantrum when she doesn\u2019t get her way, constantly guilt trips my boyfriend when he tries to do something she doesn\u2019t approve of and uses emotional manipulation to get way. My boyfriend constantly tries to create boundaries for himself, which he has a hard time doing before he met me, and his mother constantly ignores them and does what she wants because \u201cshe\u2019s his Mom and no one will tell Mom what to do or how to act.\u201d\n\nHis Mom also dislikes me. When asked why, all she says is because I\u2019m \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201chave no emotions and never try to be apart of the family.\u201d However, I always go to family events, engage in conversation when I\u2019m there, speak when spoken to and just try to be apart. I\u2019m just really shy and a very reserved person. I also have social anxiety, which my boyfriend\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t believe in.\n\nSo since my boyfriend\u2019s Mom hates me, so do both of my boyfriend\u2019s brothers. When asked the same reason, they just give the same reason as the Mom does. His older brother, Justin, has told my boyfriend that he does not like me and never will and his younger brother feels the same way. When asked to elaborate on their reasoning, they just say \u201cWe just don\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\nSo Justin\u2019s engagement party if coming up and I don\u2019t want to go. Clearly, no one in that family likes me and plans to never like me. Why should I go out of my way to be nice to them and go to family events and support Justin\u2019s relationship when he doesn\u2019t support me and my boyfriends? I tried being the \u201cbetter person\u201d for over a year with my bfs family, but they still hold their grudge. \n\nI told my bf I am not going but he can go without me. He said I\u2019m being unfair to him and that it\u2019s just \u201cone day\u201d and that I should go cause it\u2019s his family.

It's not a good sign if he cannot properly set boundaries with his mother. There is nothing you can do if people simply don't like you.

They\u2019re very selfish people and if you try to push back on anything, they just guilt trip you and make you seem like an ass for having that opinion to even begin with. They also work in numbers. It\u2019s always his family vs him.\n\nThey will definitely never have a key if I ever decide to live with him.

Marry into this family?  Have kids?  I'd dump the guy and be very clear about why.", "NTA\nI can relate to this. My in-laws are the same.

Time for one last big conversation, agree on lines in the sand, how you\u2019re both going to respond to the lines being crossed, and what you personally will do if bf fails to do or back you on the agreed response.", "The issue is going to be what the boyfriend does in response to how his family treat his partner.  If his allegiance is to his mother and brothers then he doesn't have his partners back.  He's already shown everyone that his boundaries aren't very strong.\n\nAnd if this is the case then the OP may have to put up with a lot of crap from the inlaws and she needs to decide whether it's worth her self esteem and mental health to be part of this family because the family situation is unlikely to chance even if something drastic happens.  And if they have kids... you are forever tied to them because even if you break up, you won't be able to control what the dad does with them on his time.", "I think it\u2019s cause he hates conflict and would rather just do whatever his family tells him to do in order to avoid it cause at the end of the day, his family makes a bigger deal out of everything opposed to how I deal with it.\n\nI usually just tell him, \u201cwhatever. It\u2019s your family do what you want.\u201d\n\nWhereas his family will all show up at his door, demand answers, blame me for \u201cchanging him into a heartless piece of shit\u201d (which is him just setting his boundaries) and if he doesn\u2019t answer the door, they\u2019ll let themselves in, put their foot in the door so he can\u2019t close it or hold his property (or mine) hostage until he comes out and speaks to them. \n\nAren\u2019t they such lovely people? /s", "the thing is, if you continue to be in the relationship and want to eventually marry this person, you will have to be with his family. so figure this out.", "Ngl, that whole family sounds like bad news, and continuing your relationship will most likely lead to problems in the future. My dad and his mom are kinda like what you described, and my mom gets pretty upset when he does something stupid like renewing her whole bathroom with his own money.\n\nIt's possible he's gonna be like that too at a later point, and if his mom is this bad now, she's gonna be so much worse when she gets older.\n\nJust warning you, ive seen some bad stuff, hope you dont experience the same...", "That's not always necessarily true. Sometimes the family pushes so hard that the couple does eventually go no contact. Sometimes the family pushes so hard, that the couple goes low contact. Sometimes the family can push so hard that the couple straight up moves to a different country. It's not often that that's the result, but it does happen.\n\nWhen you marry somebody, you are marrying that person not their entire family. Yes by extension they become PART of your family, but you're not marrying them. You are not marrying an entire family. You are marrying one person. You are dating one person in that family. If that family can't grasp that concept, then that's not somebody you should be dating. If your partner can't grasp that concept, then that's not somebody you should be dating or marrying."]}
