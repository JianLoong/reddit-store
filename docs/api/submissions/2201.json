Maybe you should give each other small breaks apart", "NTA\n\nThe best thing about us as parents, is that WE get to be the ones who decide how our children will be raised. Could you have been more gentle in your delivery of your point? Sure\n\nIt doesn't make you an AH for coming at her kind of hot, though", "She has her own apartment but she moved here to help since last year I had cancer. I went through chemo, laser, 8 surgeries. I am in remission but still recovering. It\u2019s hard for me at this moment to deal alone without help with work, home, and the kid. But I plan moving with my kid to live with my fianc\u00e9 as soon as he finishes the project he has abroad", "That\u2019s my point. Thank you", "Yeah I am sure it sounded bitchy \ud83d\ude29 that wasn\u2019t my goal but it\u2019s hard to control what I\u2019m saying after all her abuse and gaslighting", "Wow, thank you for support \ud83e\udd7a", "I was just trying to protect my boundaries because I don\u2019t want my kid to have same traumas. But my brother thinks I\u2019m too harsh with her so idk", "has she genuinely acknowledged things, apologized and changed anything?", "Nah, she thinks I\u2019m wrong and I am not appreciative for the help I get from her.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like she needs to go somewhere else. The point of parenting is to be better than your parents were for you that\u2019s always the goal. You could have had the best parents in the world, but there\u2019s always more you can do and learn from them.", "NTA - read another comment that says she moved in because you had cancer?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine trying to throw haze at you when you\u2019ve been through so much stress. That\u2019s unfathomable to me. Absolutely unacceptable. \n\nPlease distance yourself from her as much as possible. It\u2019s going to affect you and your child in the long term if you keep this toxic influence around you.\n\nI hope you\u2019re done with cancer for good and that you get a clean bill of health.", "NTA. But you need to protect your kid, she might be traumatizing them already.\n\nI hope you continue to make a speedy recovery.", "NTA. But if  you have the money, hire someone to help you, and Tell your mother SHE can have her own live, that you are the mother now, and she is the gran, so you have the last Word with your kids. \nDid you reali think is health for you or your kids live with her??", "I\u2019m really sorry but you are showing your child that your mother is right. Move out. Have her move out. Put yourself and your child first. NTA", "Yea, communication doesn\u2019t work", "Yes, I am in remission now but still struggling with side effects from chemo. That\u2019s why I need help around the house. While I had cancer I was also constantly blamed and told that \u201cother mothers spend time with their kids even during chemo\u201d. Imagine that :)", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that an wish you the best.  *hugs*. NTA", "I'm sorry to hear that. I too have reverse parents and it is tough to bite my tongue at times because some things just aren't constructive to say and cannot change the past.\n\nI don't think you were in the wrong, but those types of comments can't fix the current state of things. Maybe some sort of long term plan can be made soon as your mom is getting close to 65 and can maybe collect enough in SS to get a small place?", "Well I\u2019d rather not imagine that, since that makes me angry. I respect that you need help right now and do not envy the difficult situation you\u2019re in. \n\nAs soon as you can, as soon as you have an alternative - take it. Remove your mother from your life. I did the same for my father and do not regret it. \n\nHaving someone put you down all the time will erode your confidence, self worth and sanity.

Maybe you could hire someone to help and send mom on her way.", "So OP\u2019s mom lives with her to help her take care of her house and her kid. OP says she\u2019s supporting everyone financially, but mom still has her own apartment. Is OP paying for that too?\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if OP is a reliable narrator. Mom gives up her independence to come take care of her grandchild and sick daughter, yet is such a bad mother that OP specifically calls out that she doesn\u2019t want to be like her?\n\nI\u2019m sure mom wasn\u2019t perfect, but this seems like a statement made in anger rather than a true reflection of how bad mom is. Maybe something along the lines of, \u201cThere were a lot of great things about my childhood like [examples]. But there were also some things like [examples] that I would rather not emulate. They hurt me, and I don\u2019t want [kid] to have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nIt has the dual benefits of being true and more likely to result in self-reflection in mom\u2019s part.\n\nEven if what OP said was true, she\u2019s TAH for how she said it given that her mom also has a lot of positive qualities that she talked about.\n\nYTA", "NTA.", "Good luck in your recovery, which I'm sure will progress much better without this awful negativity in your home.

You need to find different help than your mother and you won\u2019t have to hear your mother trying to help you.", "NTA\n\nYou could probably benefit from some therapy. I doubt your mother would agree to it but it could help her too. \n\nI highly recommend the Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read by Philippa Perry. It's written by a psychotherapist and incredibly useful - I find it helpful just to maintaining healthy relationships in general but especially those between parents and children - both those with you parent and with your child.", "NTA\n\nI probably would hve used better word choices but the sentiment would have been the same!\n\nHead over to r/insaneparents or r/raisedbynarcissists if you want to hear stories in similae situations and for support..", "You\u2019re right", "You\u2019re right. Thank you", "Thank you! Can I find it online?", "What that her apartment is got to do with the fact that I\u2019m supporting her? That apartment has 3 co owners: me, mom and my brother. Me and my brother split to pay for renovations. I pay for bills. The apartment is 400 km away from where we live. Normally mom stays there but now it\u2019s empty since she\u2019s here. \u201cGave up on her independence\u201d, yes, but we don\u2019t talk about money now, cause she has no income when she lives there, neither. Yet, it\u2019s effort and ofc I appreciate it, money doesn\u2019t mean everything in this world. Bad mother or not- life is not white and black. I said i don\u2019t wanna be like her because she\u2019s over controlling and always criticizing. The fact she\u2019s helping doesn\u2019t cancel the toxic traits and I said that in order to line some boundaries. I am sure I have a right for that.

Works like a charm\".\n\nNTA, and stick to your guns.", "Screw her feelings. She obviously doesn\u2019t consider yours at all.

The amount of parents who blithely just say, \"it was good enough for me,\" when they received nothing but abuse and neglect is too damn high, and the amount of failed parents who want validation for their shit methods likewise.\n\nNTA", "Nta,  As a parent I am always striving for my children to be better then me, when they don't accel at everything I am ok with that. Each has their abilities that make them who they are. As for your mother to barage you with her innuendos, she obviously has no boundaries she will not cross. You've  been put through so much and to have her negate your parenting choices is abhorrent to say the least, I question is she doing this in front of your child? And are you ok with her teaching your child to belittle others. Do you want that instilled into your child's beliefs?", "When the help is done only to get her praise, etc, it's nit actually help, it's her using you to manipulate her public image and you. You don't have to feel guilty about telling her that's not the help you need. Also, she had her turn parenting, it's yours, if she can respect that and your home, she's welcome to GTFO. With the negativity and stress you are paying asking with your health for your Mom's 'help' consider if your financials can pay for help. Ah your partner if they can kick in for either cleaning assistance, mother's helper, daycare, etc. \n\nYou will heal a lot faster with her back in her own home. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
