Few days ago she drove me nuts with control the way I am educating my kid , saying that I am such a bad mother by not behaving like her. Here she most of times means that she basically had no life, no self care and no time for herself because she spent all her time and energy on over controlling her both kids. The side effect of this was that we had always tired and annoyed, exhausted yelling mother. And I said that I want to be anything just not like her. I said that she shouldn\u2019t say that I am acting wrong by not being like her because that\u2019s never my goal. Still she\u2019s my mother and I think I did hurt her feelings.
