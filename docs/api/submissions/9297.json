TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost three years now. In that three year period, he has met basically my entire family. I have a very big, very close-knit family. On the flip-side, his family is a lot smaller and a lot less close-knit. He has an estranged sister who his mom forbids him from having a relationship with, a couple of aunts that he hasn\u2019t seen in awhile, and a grandfather who is really getting up there in age that he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a kid. I have only met his parents. \n\nMy boyfriend had a dream that his grandfather died, and it spooked him, so he reached out to his grandfather that same day. He found out that his grandfather is not doing great health wise, so he decided he should go and visit him. He picked a time to go and has the trip all planned. \n\nWhen he first started planning the trip, I said I would love to help him plan it and go with him. I thought maybe he could use some support. I mean, he\u2019s going to see his dying grandfather, who he hasn\u2019t seen in years. It seems like it might be sort of emotionally tolling. He was VERY against the idea of me going, and it seemed to upset him that I had even suggested it. He said he just wants to have his own time with his grandfather. I completely understood this and backed off right away. \n\nNow, here\u2019s where I think I might be the asshole. I found out recently that he\u2019s taking a friend with him on this trip. Apparently there are a lot of rock-climbing opportunities in the state where his grandfather lives, and they\u2019re going to take advantage of that on this trip. I will admit, this rubbed me the wrong way and I was upset. I brought the subject up again because I was pretty annoyed, and he got mad and told me, and I quote, \u201cTo plan my own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine.\u201d Like, what? Then he said I could invite him on a trip I plan, but I\u2019m not going on this one with him and to get over it. \n\nI was mad. I was upset. I felt angry and dismissed. So, I booked an all-inclusive trip to Mexico for about 2 months after his trip to \u201csee his grandfather\u201d, and I didn\u2019t invite him. I\u2019m going to go and spend time being warm and getting tipsy on a beach. He thinks it was petty of me to do that, and not ask if he wants to come, too. He claims I\u2019m the one being dismissive of the fact that he just wants to visit his grandfather without me there. He says that this trip is way different than the one he\u2019s going on. I told him to plan his own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine. He wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\nAITA for planning this trip and not asking if he wants to come? \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is going on a trip to see his grandfather, and he told me he just wants to go alone when I expressed an interest in going. I found out he\u2019s bringing a friend along with him on the trip, and so I booked an all-inclusive trip to Mexico and didn\u2019t invite him.

But I don't think this relationship is worth all that. It doesn't sound like it's a good relationship at all since he's just lying straight out to you and expects you to take it.

You deserve better.\n\nHe's TA because he this as a sad, meaningful event to see his grandfather. Under that umbrella, sure he might want to go alone.  But that's not what happened.

Go and enjoy your trip", "NTA\n\nIf he truly is going to see his dying grandfather than he shouldn't be taking a friend and planning climbing trips with said friend. This is an actual vacation for him. Not just a time to see his dying grandpa. Go to Mexico and have a great time....before you do though, ditch the boyfriend permanently. Him acting like you asking to go with him was crossing a line, when all you wanted to do was be supportive, THEN asking a friend to go because he wants to go climbing, BIG RED FLAGS, EVERYWHERE! Get rid of him.", "NTA to be an AH in this case lol. He lied to you about going alone, didn't want you to join, told you to plan your own vacation and then gets mad that you did exactly that? A little time apart (especially on a beach with lots of drinks) would be great for you. If he can spend his time grieving while climbing with his friend then you can support him in his grieving process while on a beach drinking margaritas.", "Eh.

Don\u2019t allow hitchhikers, this is your time. Get it.", "ESH, I know this is only one instance in your life but it doesn\u2019t really sound like either of you really like each other that much.", "ESH. Your boyfriend sucks the most\n\n>He was VERY against the idea of me going, and it seemed to upset him that I had even suggested it. He said he just wants to have his own time with his grandfather.\n\nYeah, he's gaslighting you.

You might want to because of your boyfriend's behavior, but this is counterproductive and it's pretty hard to come back from this to a functioning relationship.", "ESH\n\nYou both sound insufferable.", "You both sound toxic, i question why you two are even in a relationship, if youre still together have fun cheating on him in mexico.", "ESH. Is he a jerk for taking a friend after telling you no, probably. Is planning a whole vacation just to be petty also childish? For sure. Also, I wish I had the kind of money to be that level of petty. Honestly, do you, but this whole argument feels like a small piece of a bigger picture. Are you going to spend your entire relationship creating gotcha moments?", "NTA. But honestly, this relationship seems to be on the rocks. I'm not sure why he wanted his friend there but not you or how he even justifies that. If he has a reason for choosing the friend over you, like if the reason is he wanted to do rock climbing and that isn't your thing, then I think he should have just told you the truth. I don't blame you for planning your own trip, but I don't see where this relationship is headed if you are going to do an eye for an eye and you still haven't even discussed why he didn't want your support during his grandfather visit. I mean to me - one of the huge benefits to being in a committed relationship is that you have a person to take trips with and such. Seems like you will both be missing out on time with each other.", "NTA", "NTA! It\u2019s deliciously petty. \n\nHe\u2019s only going to see his grandad but miraculously will be rock climbing while focusing on visiting his grandad.

NTA but sounds ridiculous. have fun in mex!", "NTA", "NTA but this doesn't sound like very good communication in the relationship. Why does he feel comfortable bringing a friend on the trip but not you? That's the crux of the issue and going on a solo trip won't fix how you feel about him not inviting you and then refusing to communicate.", "Either way, this is not sounding like a healthy relationship if you can't book a trip away together.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you sound petty af. \n\nI imagine he didn't want you to come because you would push to be involved or talk while the dude friend is coming just to climb rocks and will probably leave him alone otherwise. Or maybe the friend has been around longer than you and knows whatever complicated history is involved. Either way none of that justifies his ah response to you. He could have explained his reasoning and communicated like an adult instead of lashing out.\n\nYou had every right to book your own trip as suggested. But he is right, these trips are not remotely the same. Yes he is doing some fun activities while there but that's different than a whole as* destination vacation. You should have gone with him or at least booked it at the same time as his trip.\n\nPerhaps you should rethink your relationship if you jumped to this option so quickly.", "He's bringing a friend but not you? However, he wants you to plan trips and take him?? Is he for real???? What an AH!!!", "NTA. It's petty tho. What are the plans after you get your revenge vacation? You gonna come back and everything is going to be normal? Bc sounds like you guys are going to break up, are you fine with that?", "ESH, if not leaving more towards YTA. I feel like your making his emotional turbulence about yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s his grandfather, it\u2019s his small, disjoint family. Maybe he has some stuff he wants to work out without having to tend to a romantic relationship. This trip is NOT ABOUT YOU.\n\nAnd in return you made a trip, in spite, all about the fact that he made a trip without you. You are more than welcome to make a trip solo, you are more than welcome to go to Mexico for fun. What makes you the total asshole is to do this, throw it in his face before he even goes to see his grandfather, and then act all righteous about it.\n\nGrow up and realize that sometimes grief comes in all forms, and sometimes support means some space. It\u2019s seriously not about you right now.", "ESH time to break up with him. He's lying about the other person going on the trip. He just doesn't wanna be around you.\n\nThat your response is to get revenge is proof this relationship is over.", "ESH - him more than you\n\nGood evening from the UK! \n\nI would be upset at him implying he wanted to travel alone and then taking a friend. Especially after three years; you don\u2019t just dump your partner and go on a holiday with a pal under the guise of seeing your dying grandfather.\n\nYou were kind and supportive to offer.\n\nThen you basically booked Mexico to get back at him. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really the best way to deal with this kind of situation. In order to move past it, you would probably needed to have sat down with him and explained how you felt about what he\u2019d done, so at least he could understand your upset.\n\nThen, if he still didn\u2019t get it and you wanted to go to Mexico, you should probably have sat him down again and said that you planned to go away to have some \u2018you time\u2019, and you were just letting him know out of respect. He would probably moan, but it would be easy to help him see the hypocrisy. \n\nThat way, you\u2019re modelling the kind of behaviour you expect in the relationship, so he\u2019s at least exposed to how to do things correctly when you have a partner.", "ESH I would lean towards YTA though, I think that it is important to see that there is a difference between taking a friend and a partner. Friends are probably going to be more understanding if he asks to just do separate things for the day when he is seeing his family.  Also if you don\u2019t rock climb then you arnt really interested in the rock climbing. \n\nBooking a trip out of spite even if you did it in the heat of the moment you\u2019ve probably had a lot of time to cool off and not stick to your guns on that. So that is why I lean toward yta. \n\nHowever sounds like they need to communicate better in terms of why they are taking a friend over you and your feeing hurt is valid.", "The fact that people are in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean that they have ownership of others time. So, yes, it is silliness to get upset over other people\u2019s travel plans, and also petty to book a trip out of pure spite.", "YTA you are doing it out of spite and to be petty. He doesnt feel comfortable with you there but he does with his friend. Honestly just break up with him if this is your response.", "Both assholes this doesn't sound like a super healthy relationship. He's a dick for after 3 years, not wanting you around to meet his grandfather for maybe the last chance ever. But a 2 month long spite vacation is maybe a little overboard? I'm just amazed by the people able to take 2+ months off everything to go fuck around in a resort! Maybe Im a little jealous, but anyone with that much privilege is kinda an asshole in my book anyway haha", "He mentioned going rock climbing with his friend and how he was excited, so I asked when he was doing that, and he told me it was when he goes to visit his grandfather. So, yeah, he did tell me to my face, but he told me weeks after our initial conversation about the trip. \n\nHe just doesn\u2019t want me meeting his grandfather, I\u2019m assuming. I don\u2019t know. I just wish he hadn\u2019t lied and gotten so mad initially.", "I mean, I\u2019ve been wanting to go on a trip and have been fantasizing about going to Mexico for awhile. This was a catalyst for sure. I was petty when I booked the trip, yes, but I have a savings account just for vacationing that I haven\u2019t used much of yet! I\u2019m not regretting booking the trip at all.", "Haha, no sand will be getting into this clam. Thanks! :p", "He hates when I get upset about anything, so whenever I express that I don\u2019t like something, he gets pretty mad pretty fast. I think he says things out of anger before he really thinks about them, so yeah he says shit like that pretty often.", "Swimming with dolphins is a beautiful idea, thanks. <3", "Yea. So it sounds like his friend won't encroach on his time with his grandfather and they've planned the rock climbing side-trips. He could have planned side trips with his girlfriend as well. It sounds like he doesn't want to spend time with her.", "That\u2019s a good question.", "But sounds like a great plan.  Sometimes you do awesome things for bad reasons.  Besides, bf could always book to the same resort without being asked.  He's not entitled to a personal invitation and besides there's a potential rom-com plot embedded in all that.  NTA", "There will be a lot of pleasure mixed in with the spite, though.", "I love him. I wanted to be supportive about him taking this trip. I was happy he was reaching out to his grandfather so they could have a relationship before he passes away. But him telling me he needed to do this alone, and then turning around and inviting someone else to go with him just really hurt me.", "I would NEVER cheat on him, or on anyone else, for that matter. It\u2019s bold of you to assume I would. I\u2019ll probably end up getting a girlfriend or two to come along with me.", "This is the first time I\u2019ve ever \u201ccreated a gotcha moment\u201d, and it was because he was mad when I said I wanted to go with him, told me he wanted to do it alone, and then turned around and invited someone else. I was hurt.", "I\u2019m not a rock climber, that\u2019s true. I go to the gym with him sometimes and I\u2019m decent at it, but I\u2019ve never actually been rock climbing. Like, ya know, up an actual rock. \n\nIf I had known from the get-go that he was doing this trip to rock climb, I would have been fine with it. The only reason I\u2019m so upset is because he told me that this trip was for him to go on alone so he could get closer to his grandfather, and then I found out that he\u2019s actually going with somebody else. It just hurt me is all. \n\nHe only goes on trips with other people, I\u2019m never invited and we haven\u2019t planned any trips together yet.", "Yeahhhh, the fact that I\u2019m 99.99% sure that he fully intended on making this a rock climbing trip from the get-go is really my issue here. I mean, he lied to me when he said he wanted to be alone, he was just mad because he didn\u2019t want me to encroach upon his rock-climbing plans.", "I\u2019m hoping I can find some really good tanning lotion and get a nice tan to bring back with me. :p", "Oh, oops. His friend is like 36 or something I think, and it\u2019s another guy.", "Unless he takes his dying grandfather rock-climbing it does not really seem to be about the grandfather, either.", "He\u2019s taking a friend on the trip after he told me he wanted to go alone. That\u2019s the only reason I ended up getting upset.", "I didn\u2019t get upset until I found out he lied about wanting to be alone and was taking another person on this trip with him. That\u2019s where the problem lies.", "I\u2019m not staying in Mexico for two months, I\u2019m staying for two weeks. My trip is taking place two months AFTER his trip. Sorry for the misunderstanding!", "Did he invite his friend? Did he actually lie initially?\n\n\nOr was it him mentioning to a friend that he's going to see his grandfather and the friend being like \"I have family out there, there's awesome rock climbing in the area,\" and them kind of being like \"Ok, let's ride out together and meet up for some rock climbing or split the hotel costs or whatever \".", "If you're making plans months in advance with likely thousands of dollars in cost just to make a point/ or get the relationship feel fair, you have to start asking yourself if its really the relationship you want to be in.  \nBF is totally in the wrong, you could have gone on the trip and when he visited his Grandpa, you go do something else or stay at the hotel. So many opportunities for compromise missed.", "That's really sad and not healthy at all. Basically, he can't or won't listen to your feelings and gets angry with you for expressing them.
