TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost three years now. In that three year period, he has met basically my entire family. I have a very big, very close-knit family. On the flip-side, his family is a lot smaller and a lot less close-knit. He has an estranged sister who his mom forbids him from having a relationship with, a couple of aunts that he hasn\u2019t seen in awhile, and a grandfather who is really getting up there in age that he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a kid. I have only met his parents. \n\nMy boyfriend had a dream that his grandfather died, and it spooked him, so he reached out to his grandfather that same day. He found out that his grandfather is not doing great health wise, so he decided he should go and visit him. He picked a time to go and has the trip all planned. \n\nWhen he first started planning the trip, I said I would love to help him plan it and go with him. I thought maybe he could use some support. I mean, he\u2019s going to see his dying grandfather, who he hasn\u2019t seen in years. It seems like it might be sort of emotionally tolling. He was VERY against the idea of me going, and it seemed to upset him that I had even suggested it. He said he just wants to have his own time with his grandfather. I completely understood this and backed off right away. \n\nNow, here\u2019s where I think I might be the asshole. I found out recently that he\u2019s taking a friend with him on this trip. Apparently there are a lot of rock-climbing opportunities in the state where his grandfather lives, and they\u2019re going to take advantage of that on this trip. I will admit, this rubbed me the wrong way and I was upset. I brought the subject up again because I was pretty annoyed, and he got mad and told me, and I quote, \u201cTo plan my own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine.\u201d Like, what? Then he said I could invite him on a trip I plan, but I\u2019m not going on this one with him and to get over it. \n\nI was mad. I was upset. I felt angry and dismissed. So, I booked an all-inclusive trip to Mexico for about 2 months after his trip to \u201csee his grandfather\u201d, and I didn\u2019t invite him. I\u2019m going to go and spend time being warm and getting tipsy on a beach. He thinks it was petty of me to do that, and not ask if he wants to come, too. He claims I\u2019m the one being dismissive of the fact that he just wants to visit his grandfather without me there. He says that this trip is way different than the one he\u2019s going on. I told him to plan his own trips and stop trying to hitchhike on mine. He wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\nAITA for planning this trip and not asking if he wants to come? \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is going on a trip to see his grandfather, and he told me he just wants to go alone when I expressed an interest in going. I found out he\u2019s bringing a friend along with him on the trip, and so I booked an all-inclusive trip to Mexico and didn\u2019t invite him. He thinks I was being petty and an asshole.\n\nEdit to add: Since people keep getting confused, I just wanted to say that I\u2019m not staying in Mexico for two months. I\u2019m going to Mexico two months AFTER he takes his trip, and I\u2019m staying for two weeks. I do work full time and am in college as well, so I had to plan the trip for a couple of months out.", "created_utc": 1675703108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vbtrv/aita_for_booking_an_allinclusive_trip_to_another/", "score": 651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go and enjoy your trip", "NTA\n\nIf he truly is going to see his dying grandfather than he shouldn't be taking a friend and planning climbing trips with said friend. This is an actual vacation for him. Not just a time to see his dying grandpa. Go to Mexico and have a great time....before you do though, ditch the boyfriend permanently. Him acting like you asking to go with him was crossing a line, when all you wanted to do was be supportive, THEN asking a friend to go because he wants to go climbing, BIG RED FLAGS, EVERYWHERE! Get rid of him.", "NTA to be an AH in this case lol. He lied to you about going alone, didn't want you to join, told you to plan your own vacation and then gets mad that you did exactly that? A little time apart (especially on a beach with lots of drinks) would be great for you. If he can spend his time grieving while climbing with his friend then you can support him in his grieving process while on a beach drinking margaritas.", "Eh.

Don\u2019t allow hitchhikers, this is your time. Get it.", "ESH, I know this is only one instance in your life but it doesn\u2019t really sound like either of you really like each other that much.", "ESH. Your boyfriend sucks the most\n\n>He was VERY against the idea of me going, and it seemed to upset him that I had even suggested it. He said he just wants to have his own time with his grandfather.\n\nYeah, he's gaslighting you.

You might want to because of your boyfriend's behavior, but this is counterproductive and it's pretty hard to come back from this to a functioning relationship.", "ESH\n\nYou both sound insufferable.", "You both sound toxic, i question why you two are even in a relationship, if youre still together have fun cheating on him in mexico.", "ESH. Is he a jerk for taking a friend after telling you no, probably. Is planning a whole vacation just to be petty also childish? For sure. Also, I wish I had the kind of money to be that level of petty. Honestly, do you, but this whole argument feels like a small piece of a bigger picture. Are you going to spend your entire relationship creating gotcha moments?", "NTA. But honestly, this relationship seems to be on the rocks. I'm not sure why he wanted his friend there but not you or how he even justifies that. If he has a reason for choosing the friend over you, like if the reason is he wanted to do rock climbing and that isn't your thing, then I think he should have just told you the truth. I don't blame you for planning your own trip, but I don't see where this relationship is headed if you are going to do an eye for an eye and you still haven't even discussed why he didn't want your support during his grandfather visit. I mean to me - one of the huge benefits to being in a committed relationship is that you have a person to take trips with and such. Seems like you will both be missing out on time with each other.", "NTA", "NTA! It\u2019s deliciously petty. \n\nHe\u2019s only going to see his grandad but miraculously will be rock climbing while focusing on visiting his grandad.

(it will likely start a fight/make things worse)", "lol does he know what hitchhike means? NTA but sounds ridiculous. have fun in mex!", "NTA", "NTA but this doesn't sound like very good communication in the relationship. Why does he feel comfortable bringing a friend on the trip but not you? That's the crux of the issue and going on a solo trip won't fix how you feel about him not inviting you and then refusing to communicate.", "Either way, this is not sounding like a healthy relationship if you can't book a trip away together.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you sound petty af. \n\nI imagine he didn't want you to come because you would push to be involved or talk while the dude friend is coming just to climb rocks and will probably leave him alone otherwise. Or maybe the friend has been around longer than you and knows whatever complicated history is involved. Either way none of that justifies his ah response to you. He could have explained his reasoning and communicated like an adult instead of lashing out.\n\nYou had every right to book your own trip as suggested. But he is right, these trips are not remotely the same. Yes he is doing some fun activities while there but that's different than a whole as* destination vacation. You should have gone with him or at least booked it at the same time as his trip.\n\nPerhaps you should rethink your relationship if you jumped to this option so quickly.", "He's bringing a friend but not you? However, he wants you to plan trips and take him?? Is he for real???? What an AH!!!", "NTA. It's petty tho. What are the plans after you get your revenge vacation? You gonna come back and everything is going to be normal? Bc sounds like you guys are going to break up, are you fine with that?", "ESH, if not leaving more towards YTA. I feel like your making his emotional turbulence about yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s his grandfather, it\u2019s his small, disjoint family. Maybe he has some stuff he wants to work out without having to tend to a romantic relationship. This trip is NOT ABOUT YOU.\n\nAnd in return you made a trip, in spite, all about the fact that he made a trip without you. You are more than welcome to make a trip solo, you are more than welcome to go to Mexico for fun. What makes you the total asshole is to do this, throw it in his face before he even goes to see his grandfather, and then act all righteous about it.\n\nGrow up and realize that sometimes grief comes in all forms, and sometimes support means some space. It\u2019s seriously not about you right now.", "ESH time to break up with him. He's lying about the other person going on the trip. He just doesn't wanna be around you.\n\nThat your response is to get revenge is proof this relationship is over.", "ESH - him more than you\n\nGood evening from the UK! \n\nI would be upset at him implying he wanted to travel alone and then taking a friend. Especially after three years; you don\u2019t just dump your partner and go on a holiday with a pal under the guise of seeing your dying grandfather.\n\nYou were kind and supportive to offer.\n\nThen you basically booked Mexico to get back at him. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really the best way to deal with this kind of situation. In order to move past it, you would probably needed to have sat down with him and explained how you felt about what he\u2019d done, so at least he could understand your upset.\n\nThen, if he still didn\u2019t get it and you wanted to go to Mexico, you should probably have sat him down again and said that you planned to go away to have some \u2018you time\u2019, and you were just letting him know out of respect. He would probably moan, but it would be easy to help him see the hypocrisy. \n\nThat way, you\u2019re modelling the kind of behaviour you expect in the relationship, so he\u2019s at least exposed to how to do things correctly when you have a partner.", "ESH I would lean towards YTA though, I think that it is important to see that there is a difference between taking a friend and a partner. Friends are probably going to be more understanding if he asks to just do separate things for the day when he is seeing his family.  Also if you don\u2019t rock climb then you arnt really interested in the rock climbing. \n\nBooking a trip out of spite even if you did it in the heat of the moment you\u2019ve probably had a lot of time to cool off and not stick to your guns on that. So that is why I lean toward yta. \n\nHowever sounds like they need to communicate better in terms of why they are taking a friend over you and your feeing hurt is valid.", "The fact that people are in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean that they have ownership of others time. So, yes, it is silliness to get upset over other people\u2019s travel plans, and also petty to book a trip out of pure spite.", "YTA you are doing it out of spite and to be petty. He doesnt feel comfortable with you there but he does with his friend. Honestly just break up with him if this is your response.", "Both assholes this doesn't sound like a super healthy relationship. He's a dick for after 3 years, not wanting you around to meet his grandfather for maybe the last chance ever. But a 2 month long spite vacation is maybe a little overboard? I'm just amazed by the people able to take 2+ months off everything to go fuck around in a resort! Maybe Im a little jealous, but anyone with that much privilege is kinda an asshole in my book anyway haha", "He mentioned going rock climbing with his friend and how he was excited, so I asked when he was doing that, and he told me it was when he goes to visit his grandfather. So, yeah, he did tell me to my face, but he told me weeks after our initial conversation about the trip. \n\nHe just doesn\u2019t want me meeting his grandfather, I\u2019m assuming. I don\u2019t know. I just wish he hadn\u2019t lied and gotten so mad initially.", "I mean, I\u2019ve been wanting to go on a trip and have been fantasizing about going to Mexico for awhile. This was a catalyst for sure. I was petty when I booked the trip, yes, but I have a savings account just for vacationing that I haven\u2019t used much of yet! I\u2019m not regretting booking the trip at all.", "Haha, no sand will be getting into this clam. Thanks! :p", "He hates when I get upset about anything, so whenever I express that I don\u2019t like something, he gets pretty mad pretty fast. I think he says things out of anger before he really thinks about them, so yeah he says shit like that pretty often.", "Swimming with dolphins is a beautiful idea, thanks. <3", "Yea. So it sounds like his friend won't encroach on his time with his grandfather and they've planned the rock climbing side-trips. He could have planned side trips with his girlfriend as well. It sounds like he doesn't want to spend time with her.", "That\u2019s a good question.", "But sounds like a great plan.  Sometimes you do awesome things for bad reasons.  Besides, bf could always book to the same resort without being asked.  He's not entitled to a personal invitation and besides there's a potential rom-com plot embedded in all that.  NTA", "There will be a lot of pleasure mixed in with the spite, though.", "I love him. I wanted to be supportive about him taking this trip. I was happy he was reaching out to his grandfather so they could have a relationship before he passes away. But him telling me he needed to do this alone, and then turning around and inviting someone else to go with him just really hurt me.", "I would NEVER cheat on him, or on anyone else, for that matter. It\u2019s bold of you to assume I would. I\u2019ll probably end up getting a girlfriend or two to come along with me.", "This is the first time I\u2019ve ever \u201ccreated a gotcha moment\u201d, and it was because he was mad when I said I wanted to go with him, told me he wanted to do it alone, and then turned around and invited someone else. I was hurt.", "I\u2019m not a rock climber, that\u2019s true. I go to the gym with him sometimes and I\u2019m decent at it, but I\u2019ve never actually been rock climbing. Like, ya know, up an actual rock. \n\nIf I had known from the get-go that he was doing this trip to rock climb, I would have been fine with it. The only reason I\u2019m so upset is because he told me that this trip was for him to go on alone so he could get closer to his grandfather, and then I found out that he\u2019s actually going with somebody else. It just hurt me is all. \n\nHe only goes on trips with other people, I\u2019m never invited and we haven\u2019t planned any trips together yet.", "Yeahhhh, the fact that I\u2019m 99.99% sure that he fully intended on making this a rock climbing trip from the get-go is really my issue here. I mean, he lied to me when he said he wanted to be alone, he was just mad because he didn\u2019t want me to encroach upon his rock-climbing plans.", "I\u2019m hoping I can find some really good tanning lotion and get a nice tan to bring back with me. :p", "Oh, oops. His friend is like 36 or something I think, and it\u2019s another guy.", "Unless he takes his dying grandfather rock-climbing it does not really seem to be about the grandfather, either.", "He\u2019s taking a friend on the trip after he told me he wanted to go alone. That\u2019s the only reason I ended up getting upset.", "I didn\u2019t get upset until I found out he lied about wanting to be alone and was taking another person on this trip with him. That\u2019s where the problem lies.", "I\u2019m not staying in Mexico for two months, I\u2019m staying for two weeks. My trip is taking place two months AFTER his trip. Sorry for the misunderstanding!", "Did he invite his friend? Did he actually lie initially?\n\n\nOr was it him mentioning to a friend that he's going to see his grandfather and the friend being like \"I have family out there, there's awesome rock climbing in the area,\" and them kind of being like \"Ok, let's ride out together and meet up for some rock climbing or split the hotel costs or whatever \".", "If you're making plans months in advance with likely thousands of dollars in cost just to make a point/ or get the relationship feel fair, you have to start asking yourself if its really the relationship you want to be in.  \nBF is totally in the wrong, you could have gone on the trip and when he visited his Grandpa, you go do something else or stay at the hotel.

In the meantime though, the continuous aggression you mention in the comments isn\u2019t healthy. He sounds like he uses you like an emotional punch bag sometimes, and gaslights you into accepting it because he knows you\u2019re a kind person who is sensitive to his trauma. You deserve better sis", "I think,  your relationship is over...\nNTA tho...", "NTA but your communication sucks. Why are you in a relationship where you cannot communicate effectively and you'd both rather act tit-for-tat rather than compromising?", "I completely agree with everything you said but even if he was ONLY seeing his grandfather, she still could have gone for support and allowed him personal time for visits while she explores the city, etc. Most people in committed relationships want their SO to be around during difficult times.", "Scared my dog when I burst out laughing at \u201ckeep the sand out of your clam\u201d", "He really can\u2019t stand when I get upset with him. He has a lot of trauma from his mom getting like super upset and acting really crazy and hurting him, so whenever I even start getting a little upset he just gets super angry and doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it. \n\nI\u2019m rethinking things after seeing all of the comments that this post has. Thank you for your input. <3", "I hadn\u2019t even considered that possibility until right now. That made my tummy hurt. Ugh.", "Yeah, I need to be alone during this visit with Jose for sure.", "Yeah, apparently if I want to go on a trip with him I need to plan it all and then invite him along.", "Apparently a trip to Mexico is way different than a trip to a different state to \u201cvisit his grandfather\u201d while also doing a bunch of rock climbing. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have only met his parents.

I just decided to book a trip that I\u2019ve wanted to book for awhile because he made me upset and told me to plan my own trips. That\u2019s what I did.", "His mom is insane, that\u2019s why. He still lives with his parents as well, so he\u2019s trying to keep the peace with them.", "I\u2019m going to Mexico for two weeks two months after he gets back from his trip. I\u2019m not staying in Mexico for two months.", "Because he's gay and this is his boyfriend.", "She can do that anyway.  It happens all the time.", "Why are you with him?", "So you're not ever allowed to voice discontent without him throwing a fit?\n\nIs this really what you want for your life?", "You need to realize the truth. There is no grandfather.", ">He only goes on trips with other people, I\u2019m never invited and we haven\u2019t planned any trips together yet. \n\nFYI this is super weird and kind of sketchy.", "Lol to your comment and the one above. I hope you have a great time in Mexico!", "That\u2019s ridiculous", "You'll have to forgive me for not going through their comments.", "dont get me wrong, i'm all in favor of you having your own trips and surely thats a well deserved burn to him, but if you are in love with the man aint that a little too much of a trouble for a petty revenge? looks like he has his reasons for not wanting you in this trip, maybe try to talk about it and understand instead of making it a competition on whos going to quit first. \n\nright now it does not sound like you have any reason or motivation to go alone in this trip besides trying to spite him, and well i have not heard of a sucessful relationship with that kind of stuff happening on the background. \n\nif i'm wrong and you DO want to travel by yourself or with your friends without him for any reason despite revenge/hate, sorry then, i just understand it wrong. but from what you said here that does not seems to be the case.", "It's totally fine (great) to go on vacations without your partner, everyone should probably do it, but you are literally taking this trip motivated by spite, so it's hard to say it isn't petty? But I think maybe ESH because it doesn't seem like you're communicating that well. He wanted to do this emotional thing alone and you could understand that. Now he seems ok doing it with someone else and that feels bad. That makes complete sense, but the relationship goes nowhere if your response is 'well I can play that game too' instead of trying to let him know, and also see if you can find out information from him that helps make sense of it. Maybe he's embarrassed to fall apart with you there, maybe he wants to do things with someone outside without having to talk, maybe he's a jerk and your relationship is bad, but out-rejecting him by booking a spite trip and then shutting down any attempt to talk about it when he's upset cause he hurt you first is a recipe for an absolute disaster.", "Oh yeah, I know. I can see a future post now: \u201cAITA for having a fling on my beach trip despite being in a relationship, because my bf went on a rock climbing trip with his friend?\u201d But if she dumps him, no need for a future post!", "We\u2019ve been together for a long time. I dated a bit in high school, but he\u2019s my first real relationship, and my first everything else. I love him, that\u2019s why I\u2019m with him.", "When I went there was an option where you did a bay that they've trained the dolphins to come to (by way of tons of fish, but they dolphins can literally swim in and out). They don't sit and let you pet them, but if you're a fast swimmer they will play with you. But you swim your heart out and can tell that they are just coasting to be nice and hang out. XD", "When I went to Mexico, I swam with dolphins.  You don't have to pay those awful pool places to do so.  I had a marine biologist take me out to the open ocean to see a pod of wild dolphins, and we did not touch them, just swam with them.  It was incredible and totally safe for the happy wild animals.  I recommend doing that.", "y'all will defend dolphins but don't give one fuck that people are directly poisoning themselves with alcohol in the same thread... alcohol is responsible for most domestic violence, car accidents, and some disease too ..", "Yes--boyfriend is suspect.  Have fun in Mexico, boyfriend can kick rocks at home.  Tell him you're going rock climbing with a friend.", "Uh Oh! Is there an \"Art\" room being built anywhere?\n\nNTA!", "He said he wants to have time with his grandfather on his own, because he doesn\u2019t know him very well and they have only met a handful of times. I understand that and it isn\u2019t the reason I got upset. I just got upset because he lied about going alone.", "Okay, why do you love him? \n\nBeing together for a long time and it being your first relationship aren't very compelling reasons. This relationship sounds quite toxic.", "You shouldn\u2019t stay with someone that doesn\u2019t treat you well just because you love them and you have history. Having been with someone for a long time doesn\u2019t mean you have a good future with them. The way he treats you does not sound healthy. You need to put yourself first and that might mean leaving this relationship and that will be very difficult but down the road you will feel so much better and you will find someone that will treat you with love and respect.", "Oooo! Snap!  (I\u2019m old school like that lol.)", "Thank you for this response, you seem very kind and I appreciate you not shitting on me for saying I love him more than anything. Thanks for your advice. After all of these comments I have gotten, I\u2019m seriously thinking through things right now and trying to figure out if this relationship is even worth it anymore.", "Suuuuper dumb take", "My mom would be so proud. I wish i listened to her in 2010 instead staying in what would be 8 years of your boyfriends aditude and me not wanting to \"be petty\" or \"break our love bc he needs his space in this tricky time\" tricky time being having fun like your bf planned to have under false pretences.", "NTA. A little petty? Maybe. But not in a bad way. Not even really in a mean way. Enjoy your vacation, and maybe keep in mind that three years isn\u2019t really that long of a time when you\u2019re 23 and the whole world is at your feet. Just saying.", "NTA. But to be honest idk what you are gonna do at an all-inclusive resort for goddamn 2 months.", "Girl all those red flags are not a carnival.", "NTA. Are you sure you two like each other\u2026..?\n\nI\u2019m 100% FOR couples going on individual trips with friends. But the way he went about it was super aggressive with the \u201cstop hitchhiking on mine!!!!\u201d attitude. Idk why you\u2019d want to be with someone who is so upset at the idea of you joining him on a trip. And the fact that you got your own trip makes me think you\u2019re not usually a state 5 clinger either.", "NTA but your bf is.

You've been together for 3 years now, so is this a new behavior with him or is he this way with other things too?\n\nEnjoy your trip. Maybe think about if he's the man you want to continue having a relationship with.", "NTA", "NTA.  He had a DREAM and he is going on a trip?  Maybe he isn't telling you the WHOLE truth about why he is going to the place where his grandfather lives.\n\nThis trip is really quite odd.  A grandfather that has suddenly become very important.  A friend that gets to come but the supportive girlfriend of 3 years doesn't.  In fact, he gets mad and mean when she asks why.\n\nAlways consider what you see as a boy/girlfriend as the tip of the other's iceberg.   If you stay with him he will continue to treat you like this.  You won't take trips together.  His trips will be wrapped in secrecy.  Is this what you want in life?", "NTA- your BF is though.", "I mean, he's obviously getting what he's asked for here but it feels weird that you aren't just breaking up with him since you're clearly set on antagonizing him.\n\nHe sucks more, so I'm gonna judge NTA but you should think carefully about your choice to be in a relationship with him imo.", "NTA You're not required to include him any more than he is. Makes me wonder about this friend of his, though.", "ESH haha. He was TA first, but your reaction was hella petty. Y\u2019all are toxic for each other and would be better off apart.", "NTA if he wanted to visit his grandpa then he could, there was no need to invite his \u201cbuddy\u201d and plan to go rock climbing - IF this trip was to go visit his grandpa! He sounds like he\u2019s not good enough for you", "NTA but\u2026you gotta call it on this relationship. Is this what you want for the rest of your life?", "So he can take a friend to go on the trip but not his gf...GTFOH\n\nI would have done the same thing. Enjoy your trip. Get some sun. Can't say it's healthy but every action has a equal reaction.", "My bf and I do separate things and go on separate vacations sometimes. He likes different things than I do. I would be miserable backpacking and having to dig a hole to poop in for 7 days. He would be miserable going shopping and visiting my friends. \n\nMy friends think this is totally strange. \"You let him go places without you?!\" They ask. To which I respond, \"he's a grown man, I don't LET him do anything.And he doesn't LET me do anything, either.\" \n\nI promise you won't break if you do things separately.", "I agree. BF is being a sketch-ball, OP. His reasons and explanations for not letting you go but bringing some friend to go rock climbing are bizarre. You're NTA, but I'd be very aware of what's going on in your relationship. His behavior truly is bizarre.", "How long between \u201cthe dream \u201c and trip to see grandpa?.  How long has he known this 36 year old friend that he\u2019s going rock climbing and has he gone climbing with him before?", "Get another bf. Nta", "My dad is like this and it took me years into a relationship with an emotionally well adjusted man to figure out how to communicate that I did not like something my partner did or said. I basically learned as a child it was better to just stew in my feelings than attempt to challenge my father because he would just get mad and he will NEVER change. Turns out he has a lot of abandonment issues due to shitty step dad's, so any time we got mad at him, or were sad, or were bored, he took that as a personal attack that meant we didn't love him. Idk if thats your boyfriend's issue, but I would at least talk to him about why hes so bad at conflict resolution. And if he's not working on it, consider if you really feel like dealing with this man with the EQ of a toddler for the rest of your life. My mom just ended up being my dad's emotional translator/shield all the time and making his excuses for him to all the people he irritated with his volatility.", "No please don\u2019t swim with the dolphins, animal exploitation for tourism is horrible. \n\nPlenty of fabulous other things you can do!", "Please don't pay to swim with dolphins - they are abused, research it :(", "if I saw a future with my partner, I would want them to meet an ailing grandparent before it was too late.....\n\nedit for clarity: as in if I was the boyfriend, I would want my girlfriend to meet my grandfather before it's too late.", "It's normal and healthy to have negative emotions. What actually needs to happen is that he needs a therapist to help him learn coping skills and strategies to manage his trauma. You can empathize with this man for what he's been through, but he has to take ownership of his actions. It's his mental health and you can't manage that for him. \n\nThis isn't a phobia you can just remove from the house. You can't just deal with the spiders for him or not adopt an animal- he wants to remove a part of *you* to avoid dealing with his own feelings.", "Between this comment & the other things you said about him, you need to dump this guy & find someone who treats you better. He doesn't sound like a good guy at all & you can do much better for how caring of a person you are. Sounds like he takes advantage of your kindness.", "How long has he been rock climbing?", "Agreed. I think this was a perfect response by OP. Imagine how fucking boring everyone's life would be if we only ever made perfectly mature decisions. OP did nothing wrong and isn't hurting anyone here.", "Do you know if he actually did reach out to his grandfather or was that just a lie?", "Are you sure", "Oh well, who knew, two months is the only time frame you mentioned.

Gonna be climbing Brokeback Mountain.", "If you're going to Mexico, maybe go visit the grey whales instead?  Apparently when they're wintering, some of them actually enjoy playing with people.  I can't find it, but I read an article by a marine biologist who studies them that it's the darndest thing.  The whales couldn't care less about people most of the year, but when they're wintering in the lagoons in Mexico, it's like they're on vacation as well, and lots of them like to come up to people in boats to get scritches.", "I want him to go and spend time with his grandfather.

In certain bays there are hundreds of whales. It\u2019s regulated but if you sit in a boat for a long enough time one will usually get curious and bump your boat and then you can pet them.
