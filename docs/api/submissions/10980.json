Together we have a 5 year old son, 3 year old daughter, and we adopted a 3 month old girl. \n\nMy husband's 16 year old is mixed. My husband is white and her mom is Indian.

It's very clear that they don't like her to anyone except my husband. \n\nThe last time they saw our kids was 5 months ago when we adopted our daughter. They came to meet her and brought gifts for me, my husband, and all of the kids except for our 65 year old. When I asked about her gift, they said \"well, she's 15 now so we thought she wouldn't need one\". They didn't speak to her at all that night. She ended up calling her boyfriend and asking him to pick her up after dinner and didn't come home until they were gone.\n\nMy family is great with all of the kids. Before they met my 16 year old (10 at the time) they asked for what size clothes and shoes she wears, favorite colors, favorite movies, shows, and an amazon wishlist so they could know what to get her when they visit. They have been very involved in her life since the day they met her. Hell, she started calling my mom grandma before she started calling me mom.  When my parents visit, they make sure to get at least a few hours with just her to take her to breakfast or shopping, or anything that's not designed for the 5 kids under 10. \n\nMy husband's parents have been asking to come see the kids but I've been refusing to let them visit because of the way they treated our oldest when they met the baby.

There is absolutely no benefit in allowing a grandparent to be borderline abusive and racist towards their grandchild.  \n\nBeing a grandparent is a privilege, not a right.  They have to earn that right back after behaving the way they did.  Starting with a formal apology and attempting to make up for being so disrespectful.  They will likely refuse.  That's on them.

It's not fair for them to treat your oldest child differently and exclude her from gifts and conversations.

Your husband should try to understand your concerns and work towards finding a solution that works for everyone, including your 16 year old daughter.", "NTA. His parents are racist and don't need to be around the oldest daughter at all. And I wouldn't want them pushing their views on the younger kids either or making sly comments/actions.

No need to damage the children by exposing them to this behaviour.", "NTA. But the main problem is your husband.
