Actually your way of handling this is brilliant. The rules should clearly be that all adults pick up after themselves as a matter of course. They are human, not monkeys at a zoo. All children are in training to learn how to pick up after themselves, and of course the training doesn't stop just because the grandparents or the cousins come to visit. It is to do with a certain grade of civilization. Non civilized people may not want to pick up after themselves, but other people may choose not to associate with them on any level.", "NTA. **You have a husband problem.** Not an in-law problem. Yes, they are messing up your house. But that is because your husband won't stand up to them or back you up. The easiest solution is to tell all of them that they have to stay in a hotel when they visit you. No more freebies. No more maid service. Until things change, go enjoy a nice visit with your parents when the in-laws roll into town :)", "NTA for sure. This is a classic monster in law. Just don\u2019t let them in the house any more, you shouldn\u2019t be forced to leave. If they damage any property, sue their asses.", "Like everyone else I really love your solution here. But I think you have a larger problem. The amount of push back you're still getting from your husband about letting your inlaws dictate how to raise your children gives me some concerns. \n\nEven if you found a way to avoid the messiness problem, until he learns how to stand up to them on his own, there's always going to be another inlaw problem around the corner.\n\nNTA. But in need of some couples counseling.", "NTA I think it's a great tradition. Inlaws visit, you go elsewhere. Let them deal with their own messes.", "NTA. But next time give the option to the kids if they want to go with you to visit your parents or stay home with their dad to visit his parents. \n\nBut going to your parents house by yourself is probably a nice break.", "NTA. Your husband needs to pull his head out of his butt and take responsibility for HIS home. How absolutely spineless.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nLove the way you showed them photos! Good move.", "NTA.  Your current solution is just fine.  If his family never shows up on your doorstep again to mess up your house and eat your food - well, that sounds like a win to me.", "NTA. You have come up with an excellent solution to this problem.", "NTA.  If his family is trashing the house and he doesn't have the balls to say anything, he's responsible for cleaning it up.", "NTA! I love your solution. It\u2019s absolutely perfect. You have just removed yourself from the equation. Now, whenever any of those people whine, it\u2019s easy to shrug and say, \u201cIt\u2019s not my mess. It\u2019s not my family. I\u2019m not even there.\u201d It\u2019s so beautifully spiteful without even behaving in a spiteful manner. It\u2019s just, \u201cSee y\u2019all later!

Great strategy! Keep it up. Don\u2019t give in.", "Inside I\u2019m dying! You\u2019re mean and abusive and manipulative for not cleaning up after the super duper in-laws?! \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your husband is a spineless asshole and a sexist.

YOU GO SISTER, STAND ON THAT LINE!!  I am cheering for you!!", "NTA.  Love this!", "NTA, what a great way to handle this! Love it.", "NTA- You're brilliant. Your husband can kick rocks. Unless he and his inlaws can demonstrate they're capable of visiting and not making a giant mess I think you're doing the right thing to leave everytime", "NTA, what you\u2019re doing is awesome. I\u2019m lucky with my current in-laws. But my first mil was awful. Simply awesome.", "This is genius. Keep it up. Your husband made this mess, he can either clean it up or hire someone. It won't kill him to pick up after his slob relatives.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - You are the hero we all need.", "NTA. Adore this solution. \n\nEveryone saying you have a husband problem isn't wrong, but the beauty of your solution is that it addresses the problem at the source. \n\nGlorious!", "I love your style and envy your backbone.

BRAVO!!", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, but what I mean is that you are a glorious AH and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.", "NTA. This is 100% brilliant.", "Your husband sounds like a child, and his family sounds like uncivilized slobs. NTA", "Nta, it isn\u2019t for you to clean after grown adults. Great you have a good plan, maybe people will learn", "NTA\n\nI love your approach.", "NTA, you definitely sound like you have a husband problem though! He needs to grow a spine with his family, big time.

I would start truly asking yourself, are you better with him or better without", "You are NTA. Remind him that either having his family clean up after themselves or paying out of his discretionary funds is far, far, cheaper than child support.", "NTA \nThere have been times family visits with the \u201cwe\u2019re on vacation\u201d attitude. Which is fine, but if you are looking for housekeeping and meals, might I suggest a few lovely B&Bs nearby.", "NTA and kudos on how you handled it \ud83c\udfc6", "Outstanding on your part. NTA", "NTA. You also handled this with facts and evidence, so I applaud you.\n\nAlso, who the hell has guests that come over and make an absolute effing mess? That\u2019s childish and entitled. They can stay at a hotel if they want maid service.\n\nAlso, I recommend showing your husband this whole thread.", "What a brilliant solution. You're like a hero for this. lol\n\nNTA.", "Brilliant! Absolutely NTA!", "NTA", "NTA, and this is a brilliant solution!!", "NTA you have a very shiny spine and are completely correct", "Who cares if he says you\u2019re being unfair. \n\nHis family, his problem.  \n\nStop trying to help him solve it. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know honey.
