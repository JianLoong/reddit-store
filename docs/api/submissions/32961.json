Actually your way of handling this is brilliant. The rules should clearly be that all adults pick up after themselves as a matter of course. They are human, not monkeys at a zoo.

I worked full-time and I would come home when they were there and clean up everything. And I mean there was stuff everywhere plus a totally trashed kitchen, even after the first day. But by the third or fourth day I was worn out on it and I just let it go and I would do it all when they left. The one time I asked the most egregious offender to clean up their stuff so I could clean my house the next day. It was horrible. She got extremely angry, which she was prone to anyway. She had the five year old girl, crying and pushing a vacuum cleaner because I said they had to clean the house. obviously, she was prone to exaggeration as well because I only ask them to pick up their things and put them in their bedrooms. Anyway, it didn\u2019t get cleaned and she threw an hellacious fit on me, making sure I knew I was a totally worthless human being. They packed up their things and left that evening.  So as the years went by, 14 of them being married to him actually, I could not do it anymore and I left and came back to my home town and family in West Virginia. Was that a hard choice? Yes it was hard or I would\u2019ve stayed for 14 years but it was totally 100% absolutely worth it. I dreaded, then hated the idea of summer all of those years.
