They said that a man couldn't raise girls to be quality young ladies. Both girls are extremely smart, especially the oldest, they are kept clean and well dressed, we do tons of things together, travel, go to the beach, do all the things a 'family' should be doing. But my mother and sister don't see it that way. They think I'm 'Abusing' my girls by not having a woman in my life to be a role model for them. I think that's ridiculous, moms raise boys all the time, why can't a guy raise girls? I have zero interest in dating, my girls and I are too busy for me to date.

You are doing an excellent job of raising your girls on your own, and it is not necessary to have a woman in your life to be a role model for them. Your girls have a loving father who is doing everything he can to provide for them, and that is more than enough. Your mother and sister are being unreasonable and disrespectful by constantly harassing you about finding a new mom for your girls. It is your life, and you have every right to live it the way you see fit. It's also understandable that you have no interest in dating and want to focus on your family. You are doing what's best for your girls, and that's what matters.", "Man, this is so sad. NTA\n\nI'm a quality woman raised by a single dad. \n\nYour mom and sister are, to put it bluntly, full of sh\\*t. \n\nI think that all kids need good role models of all genders. This is just good for their development. But those role models don't need to be a 'mom'. My female role models were aunts, grandmothers, parent's friends, teachers, all kinds of people. As well as plenty of good male role models.\n\nIt can be weird to grow up as a woman without a mom, certainly. Sometimes you wonder who to go to with stuff, or whether your dad will understand. But the way to deal with that is assuring your daughters that you will understand, and also guiding them to women to talk to when they need to. Again, it doesn't mean you have to have a stepmom in the picture.\n\nThe most important thing though is that you are there for your daughters and nurture good relationships with them. The rest you can figure out together along the way. \n\nAnd don't be scared to talk to them about 'girl stuff' or let anyone convince you that you can't care for them and show them love and affection. \n\nIt would also be weird and bad for them if you to try to date and marry when you don't want to. Parents being in relationships they don't want to be in is not good role modelling for kids. \n\nLeave your mom and sister's archaic ideas in the dust, and just make sure you have some other good women somewhere in your social life to be among the role models for your girls, because I don't think that your mom and sis's outdated, seemingly sexist views are gonna be the greatest influence.", "Did they ever stop to think about the fact that they themselves could be the positive female role models in your girls' lives? Totally NTA, you're doing great, dad!", "NTA. First off, sorry about your loss my guy. As a single father myself, we are more than able to care for our children without a \u201cmom\u201d figure.", "NTA. You are perfectly capable of doing this on your own. I am a female and my dad raised me wonderfully as a single dad. Do your best to keep their mom's memory alive - she doesn't need to be (and cannot be) simply replaced. \n\nMy dad met someone when I was a teenager and she immediately drove a wedge between us. Don't let that happen with your girls. Only marry someone that you truly love and make sure that person also loves your girls with her whole heart.", "I think your mom and sister are sexist, regressive assholes.", "NTA. Your daughters are going to be just fine. It's unfortunate that the women in your life are not supportive of your emotional needs. They have outdated views on what a father can be. Your daughters don't need that type of role model.", "NTA. I grew up in a similar situation. My dad raised three daughters (including myself) without a woman in his life. He dated two women briefly but not long enough for them to be a figure in my life. All three of us grew up to be smart, confident, and with a high standard for how men treat us. You\u2019re doing amazing and your family is not being supportive at all! Both of them can be a female role models in your daughters\u2019 lives, you don\u2019t have to be married for them to have that.", "NTA. You've just taught your daughters about boundaries and self-respect. You should *never* go on the prowl for a woman to turn into a stepmother for them. Getting together for the kids is the only thing worse for a child's home life than staying together for the kids. If you meet someone, great, if you don't, just go on being the best father you can be to them.", "NTA. If they think the girls need a woman presence in their lives, why don\u2019t they step up?", "NTA.\n\nIf your mom & sister behaved appropriately, they could have been good female influences on your girls.  But, alas, they chose to be judgmental A H about your parenting.\n\nYou're doing a good job dad.  You are capable of raising good, decent human beings that happen to be female.", "NTA. Family\u2019s come in all shapes and sizes. You look out for your kids and care for them. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job to me.", "NTA no one can replace those girls' mother, and your mom and sister should understand that and stop. Next time they bring up that they need a \"real mom\" respond with \"they have a real mom, it's just unfortunate that she can never be here. It will have to suffice for me to tell them the stories I know she would have told them.\"", "NTA\n\nSingle parents can be great parents. If you\u2019re not ready to date, that\u2019s far healthier than just trying to find a wife. \n\nYour mother and sister are blowing their chance to be great role models for your girls.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA \n\nYou are being a wonderful parent!!! You don\u2019t have to be the same biological gender as your child to raise them well, and I sure as shit bet they wouldn\u2019t be saying this about your sister needing a father for her sons if the roles were reversed.", "NTA.. in no way and no form would you be!\nMy parents divorced when I was young. Although I live with my mother. My father was the best parent. He was the best father, and best mother any girl could ever have.", "NTA. You're doing an amazing job with the tragic hand you were dealt. At a certain age I'm sure they would appreciate having a woman around for certain things. But that's where your mother and sister should be willing to help. You shouldn't be looking for a new wife simply to have a female there for them. You look for a wife for you. And you find one that obviously wants a relationship with your girls.", "NTA at all and that's a messed up way for your mom and sister to think. Find a new mom for your girls. As the daughter of a widower, I am disgusted for you.  \n\n\n\\> They think I'm 'Abusing' my girls by not having a woman in my life to be a role model for them.  \n\n\nWhat on earth do they think *they* are?", "NTA-My best friend\u2019s mom passed away during her birth. Her father never remarried and raised her alone. She\u2019s an amazing person as is her father.  You clearly love your girls and are doing your best for them snd with them. They don\u2019t need a mother when they have a fantastic father.", "NTA-sounds like you are doing the best you can for your children. Your mother and sister on the other hand seem to be stuck on toxic repeat. It\u2019s weird they are fixated on \u2018a man can\u2019t raise daughters\u2019. I would suggest cutting them off until they can agree to stop attacking your parenting.", "NTA\n\nTime to start disengaging when they bring this up", "NTA\n\nHaving a bad \"mom\" (parent) can be significantly worse than having no mom (parent). \n\nYou're doing absolutely nothing wrong, and your family sounds amazingly toxic for no readily apparent reason. In fact, if they were so worried about your kids having a \"mom,\" they might be throwing out pointers or ideas that could help YOU in the situation present, instead of pretending like simply plugging a female into the mix would resolve everything. \n\nYou're doing a significantly better job of setting an example for your children to aspire to than either one of those \"ladies\" (your mother and sister). Personally speaking, I don't know that I would be able to continue contact with family members that spoke like that. \n\nBest of luck, and stay strong!", "NTA \n\nEverything a mother can do for their children, a father can do just as well. I'm sorry for your loss, OP. Your children are your world and maybe in the future your family will grow or not but that is your choice and it has to be the right time and person for you and your daughters. Stay strong and don't listen to your Mom/sister. You know what's best for you and your daughters.", "NTA!!  men can be as effective at parenting as women. in fact, your doing the right thing to not date right now, your girls know they are your priority. it's sad you Mom and sister aren't more supportive and proud of you. it sounds like your doing an amazing job.", "NTA you're a great father doing a amazing job....your mother  and sister dont know and if they are concern that bad why they won't  ne female role models ..\n I'll  block and ignore  they pop up dont answer  the door...\n\nStay away from them toxic people", ">They said that a man couldn't raise girls to be quality young ladies.   \n  \nNTA - Yeah just no to the above and you do you. Are there different advantages to different situations, of course but doesn't always mean that they are always better and DOES NOT mean you can't raise your girls in the right way and extremely fucking well. Good luck man...", "NTA You sound like a good dad for your daughters. Your sister and mother sound toxic, cut them out of your daughters lives or they will freely spread their poison around to your girls.", "NTA. You are perfectly capable of raising your daughters. Especially if their aunt and grandmother can be positive female role models. I hope they will focus on their own roles in the girls lives as you all raise them to know and love their mother whom you all loved and who loved all of you.", "NTA - you sound like an absolutely amazing and wonderful father. you keep doing exactly what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll find a partner when you\u2019re ready to. \n\nand tell your mother and sister that the internalized misogyny is being AWFULLY loud", "NTA at all! \n\nYou sound like you're doing amazingly for your girls, they're priority #1 and that's how it should be.\n\nIf your mom and sister are so worried about the lack of female role models, why don't they step up? They're aunt and grandma, are they not?", "NRA, can't your mom and sister add that \"feminine\" touch to your child rearing? Why are they so insistent you re-marry? \nTell them to read all the step-parent AITA's!", "As a woman and a mother NTA. You are responsible putting them first. Brining another person who is not related to them in could be disastrous. I don't believe it's something your wife would have wanted. I know it's something I don't want if anything happens to me. Your family is being selfish by not being more supportive. Your sister wants a woman in your daughters life? Why hasn't she stepped up?", "NTA!!!! Good for you!!! This is a horrible attitude from them. You\u2019re doing amazing and your girls and your wife are so thankful and blessed\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: A child doesn\u2019t need a \u201cmom\u201d and a \u201cdad\u201d - they just need adults who keep them safe and love them unconditionally", "NTA, but your sister is. I have met some amazing women who were raised but just their awesome dads. They were very confident, smart, empathetic, and hard-working.  Don't stop what you're doing because of what someone else says. Hopefully, you will find someone deserving of your family, but don't go looking for someone just to appease someone else. That is not the reason to find a new spoise.", "NTA, your mom and sister have a very outdated view on what constitutes a family", "Hi! I have a single dad! My mom died when I was older than your girls (11) but I can tell you that the LAST thing I ever needed was another mom. Parents of gay dads manage to grow up just fine. The worst thing you could do for your daughters is force yourself into a relationship you don't want, to try and replace the mom they already had. You'd be better served going what you're already doing, and making sure to talk to them often about their mom and keep her memory alive for them, as much as you can. You're NTA, and your mom and sister are regurgitating weird sexist bullshit that doesn't serve you or your daughters well. I honestly would avoid them.", "NTA - what about kids who have 2 dad's?  You're doing great; especially not forcing your kids to have a so called 'mom'. Your mom and sister could have been the role models; but they're missing that chance by being AHs themselves.", "I\u2019m tired of reading about these people who talk about \u201cgetting a new mom.\u201d Like a mom is just a replaceable object.", "Ignore those two. You're doing great, Dad. I'd tell them to drop the subject completely,  with you AND your girls, or you will go no contact. First, last and final warning. And then stick to it.\n\nNTA", "NAH. \n\nI do think young girls/boys need a male/female role model in their lives because there are certain thing you as a man wont be able to relate with them on no matter how hard you try. I was raised by a single mom and while she was great there's things specific to me as a boy that she doesn't and will never understand.\n\nThere's that one Adam Sandler movie about it but I forget the name", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Time to go no contact with your mom and sister if there just gonna call you abusive and a bad dad", "NTA. Not only is it absolutely none of their business, but those kinds of ideas are completely obsolete. Of course a man can raise daughters on his own. The only way they would be justified in trying to intervene is if there was actually abuse going on. Watch out, though. One or both of them may try to take the kids from you by making such accusations against you. Honestly, I think it's time to go NC on both of them.\n\nI would like to add that at some point they're going to have their periods, and it would be better if you got a female friend to help them out, explain everything, etc. Most men aren't as well educated about that as they should be.
