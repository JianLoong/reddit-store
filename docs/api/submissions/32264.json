My brother hadn\u2019t even been home all day because he was sleeping over a friend\u2019s house, so I knew it had to have been there since the morning. I checked the footage and sure enough, it had been there all day recording everything I did in my room. I also had my boyfriend over that day and we were \u201cintimate\u201d in my bedroom. \n\nI was furious with my brother for invading my privacy like that. So I deleted all the footage and smashed his camera with a bat. I wasn\u2019t sure if he had a way of getting videos back after they were deleted, so I just wanted to make sure it was gone. And I think he doesn\u2019t even deserve to own a camera if he can\u2019t follow the number one rule, which is don\u2019t record people without their consent. \n\nWhen he came home today, I confronted him about it. He said that there is a trend on YouTube where people hide cameras in their siblings bedrooms and he wanted to do it for his YouTube channel. When he found out I broke his camera, he called me a bitch and said I overreacted. He said that he could\u2019ve gotten famous if he posted the video on YouTube. \n\nI told my parents about the whole situation and they also think I took it too far by breaking his camera. But I still think he\u2019s the one who took it too far by invading my privacy.

Definitely get him on a register for life with that.", "NTA. I get why you broke the camera. Your brother is definitely an AH, especially if he knew you and your boyfriend were being intimate. If he didn't know, he was being a creep by recording you without your consent, but if he did know, he would go from creep to disturbing pervert behavior. Two different levels of severity. He also gets the disturbing pervert behavior label if you told him you were intimate, and he said he could have posted it to YouTube and gotten famous. Either way, he needs some serious discipline and lessons on consent. Your parents need to react more to this behavior. This is a literal crime and incredibly disturbing.", "NTA.  If he were a legal adult, I'd press charges.  And if he had managed to post an \"intimate\" tape about you on the internet, I'd press charges even if he wasn't an adult.", "Your parents are ok with your brother wanting to film his sister changing etc?   You need to move out becuase you didn't go far enough. If they get him another camera break that one immediately.", "LOL HE SAID ITS A \u201cTREND\u201d TO *HIDE* A CAMERA IN YOUR SIBLINGS BEDROOM\n\nThis has me fucking reeling, it\u2019s so obvious what he was hoping to record but I never would have expected his deflection to be so weak", "NTA. He committed a crime.", "NTA. Invasion of privacy is never ok. Especially from a trusted family member. Your parents should have been horrified by his actions, who else has he been filming to put on youtube?", "Absolutely unacceptable behavior by your brother and parents too from what\u2019s given actually. While I\u2019d think donating the camera would have been better than breaking it I don\u2019t fault you for breaking that and not, say, your brother\u2019s nose. Especially after what he said when you confronted him. He needs to understand the severity of his actions here and he clearly doesn\u2019t nor does it appear your parents are ensuring he does.", "Hold on. Your parents didn\u2019t do anything after they were told their son used a hidden camera to record his sister??? What the actual fuck?? NTA and I would have used the bat to smash his head as well. Seriously. You\u2019re not TA but your parents are.", "NTA\n\nWhat he did was creepy and illegal.\n\nSmashing his camera is the least of what he deserves!", "NTA \n\nWhat your brother did is commit multiple felonies just now and your parents are just okay with that? I would make it very very clear that if you ever find a camera hidden in your room again you are not going to smash it you're going to be calling the police.", "NTA. Pretty sure recording someone 'in the act' without their knowledge or consent and posting it online would fall under revenge porn laws, and is a federal crime. Remind your parents and brother of this every time they bring up the camera.", "NTA. And when they replace the camera, he will do it again, in a better hiding space, so check carefully. He'll probably use a pinhole camera, something that looks like a phone charger.  Your brother is a perv. He wants to become famous posting a sex tape? You can remind him that it was Paris Hilton that became famous, not the dirtbag who posted it. It was Kim Kardasian that became famous. Not the perv who posted it.\n\nAnd if and when you find it, just destroy it. Don't say anything. It shouldn't be in your room. Therefore, HE didn't put it in there, did he? Therefore, it wasn't his. Therefore, you didn't destroy anything of his.", "No, I think it is indeed quite reasonable to destroy a hidden camera you found in your bedroom that was recording you having sex\u2026", "NTA.   Though I do wonder what would have happened if you destroyed it, but didn\u2019t approach him.  To ask you where the camera is would be admitting he planted it.  What would he have done then if you told him you haven\u2019t seen it?  Gone to tell your parents that you must have done something with the camera he planted in your room to film you changing and/or doing other private things?  Can you imagine if he posted any of that?  \n\nIf your parents didn\u2019t immediately set boundaries on both of your privacies and expectations for each of you they are also wrong here.", "NTA. Street justice", "Definitely NTA.\n\nIn fact, I'm very sure you under reacted!! Involve parents, aunts, uncles, every one. \n\nLike wtf man.", "Uh, YouTube would have removed that video. He could have posted it on a porn site instead. Your brother is a creep. NTA", "NTA your brother is lucky it was the camera that got the bat.\nParents need to sit him down and have a serious word about boundaries, consent and consequences!", "NTA\n\nWhat he did is not just an AH move, it's a crime. You can go to the police. And why do your parents think it's OK for him to make a home porn with you as its star?", "NTA\n\nNot sure where you live but that is a violation of privacy laws in Canada. You could report him to police and still are NTA in my opinion.", "ABSOLUTELY NTAH! what he did is illegal and a violation of any trust.  The boys will be boys attitude is BS.  You have every right to expect privacy in your room. Check his you tube to find other videos, odds are is not the first time", "NTA maybe tell your brother that you felt you had two choices.  Break the camera or call the police.  What he did was illegal, not to mention creepy AF!  You did him a favor!\nThe fact that your parents think you did something wrong is reprehensible!", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s lucky you aren\u2019t pressing charges", "Your brothers a creep.", "NTA\n\nWhat your brother did is wrong on so many levels, and definitely illegal, so he deserved to learn a lesson having his camera broken", "NTA- Tell your parents that you saved him from an intent to distribute pornography charge as you were naked (don't mention the boyfriend, just being naked), had you gone to the police.\n\nAnd make sure both parties know if this happens again, you will report it.\n\nI don't care if your brother is 14.  If something is put online, it's online forever.  And leaked naked stuff can ruin your future.", "NTA.\n\nTell him there\u2019s a new trend on YouTube where people smash hidden cameras with bats.  He\u2019s lucky you aren\u2019t participating in a related trend, smashing Peeping Toms with bats.", "It\u2019s good you spotted the camera, OP! Otherwise this reel would have circulated forever online!\n\nI can\u2019t believe there was no remorse from your brother - but most shocking is your parents\u2019 reaction (rather, the absence of it)! They should have grounded / withheld electronics / added chores to your brother.\n\nWhat if a video of you undressing (in the privacy of your own bedroom!) began circulating online, for your classmates (and all kinds of anonymous perverts) to see? Teenagers like you have killed themselves over leaked pics like that (you can google the grim tally). People have become victims of stalking and abuse as a result of such \u201cinnocent\u201d pranks!\n\nBy not imposing an outsized punishment upon your brother (who clearly cannot comprehend the potential ramifications of his actions!), your parents are essentially negating the potential life-threatening consequences to you. This is not okay. They should do better.", "If you haven\u2019t yet, explain to your parents what he would have captured regardless of what trouble you believe you\u2019ll get in. You\u2019re going to realize that being honest about everyone, including yourself, makes everyone a lot stronger and more reasonable in the future. And if not, then you have nothing but a clear conscience to cut all ties with no expectation that they will change or reason with you.", "YTA for not further. Obviously kidding. But I would have gone much much further. Deleted YouTube account, virus in computer, and that's just the starter. See how he likes privacy invasion.\n\nGood on you, but watch if he tries that shit again.", "No ur brother is", "NTA - Maybe breaking the camera was a bit much but it was also a good lesson in not following every trend without thinking about the consequences.", "Break the camera with a bat? Fuck that. Break HIM with a bat!", "YTA for not beatin his ass", "Nope. You taught him a lesson in privacy. It's your room. Your privacy and he violated it. He also ruined trust between you two.

It\u2019s not fair to have a device by you that you\u2019re unaware of, it\u2019s unfair to give the same level of control right back to the brother even if he had valuable stuff.

You aren\u2019t wrong for feeling badly about this. I would definitely be cautious going forward. It may be worthwhile to talk to other adults you trust about this and perhaps they can talk to your parents to impress upon them the significance of this and how more appropriate action is needed on their end. You should feel safe in your own home.", "NTA-Your parents need to watch a few SVU episodes of \"peeping Toms\" and how the boy's were once so sweet and innocent and then became creepy and recorded unsuspecting women so they could use the footage for masturbation.\n\n Personally, I would have punched the brother in the face and then asked questions after I knew footage was permanently deleted.

I would also consider him going further than you. The one thing on my mind is to offer advice that people are like this, willing to insert a tool of their knowing it can be destroyed with no reflection on their character. Just don\u2019t forget that even if people change, you stopped what \u201cwould have\u201d been the really bad thing (sharing and viewing these videos). He never got to see what your reaction would be then, and I think it\u2019s important to know that you controlled that. \n\nJust meaning that your worries need to be agreed on by yourself so no one can convince you that you\u2019re not just protecting yourself. You didn\u2019t hit or abuse your brother, your broke the tool he used to spy on you - fancy or not - it could have been a flip phone with a camera pointed at your bed - it still broke your boundaries.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to be saying anything differently, but I also know that tomorrow you may not think of this and that\u2019s when people in your life try to play you again.", "Nah but fr your bro is a little twerp and deserved it.
