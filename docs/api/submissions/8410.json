They liked us. \n\nNow the building has all older people. My direct neighbour across is in her 70's. My direct neighbour aside is in his 60's and also autistic. \n\nAbove him lives my problem neighbour. He is in his 50's and has quite the temper. It started first with him coming down to the autistic neighbour in the morning to yell at him. After that I heard him argue in the hallway over that those dogs have to go. \nIt escalated to an argument between us and it has stayed tense since. \n\nNow, last night at 3 am I got a message from him. I got told to immediately shut my dogs up and that he was gonna report to my landlord I drill every day at 19h00 into the walls.\n\nSo ofc, that message woke me up and got me annoyed. My dogs are sleeping in the bed and next to our bed, they were asleep. My boi even straight on my shoulder. \nSo I told him that my dogs aren't barking and if he hears dogs barking, he might want to see a doctor. \nI then also continued by telling him that at 19h00 I am using a smoothie blender to make food for my dogs. So he can talk to my landlord all he wants. I also suggested that closing his front door and stop yelling at his wife might lower the noise in the hallway that makes my dogs release a bark or two (like seriously.... they barely bark. It has gone through the other neighbours already and only 1 other person said that they barked a lot but she withdrew her vote). \n\nNow at 6, I received a message from the guy who oversees most in the building I wasn't wrong but was very rude to say the man needed a doctor. \nI told him that I was no longer apologizing since my security camera has picked up that horrible neighbour knocking on my door and then running off. He is trying to make my dogs bark I guess?\nHe also apparently does not understand I am home 90% of the time due to chronic illness... and I have already opened the door in his face when he was about the knock. \n\nNow with waking me up at 3am for a bogus story I have had it completely.

He is hearing her dogs barking when they aren\u2019t. Sure, it was said in the heat of the moment, but overall, it\u2019s pretty tame.", "Don't think that is a thing in my country tbh :/ \nI can go ask at the police office tomorrow if I can but I don't think so. Especially since he is living with his wife.\n\nAnd I don't think he is gonna leave me alone. I don't know what his problem is. Maybe he just really hates dogs? \nOr he is afraid, given our young age, we don't fit in the building. Or wanna try for children soon. \nIt went fine at first, because the first months people didn't even realize we had dogs!", "No only my appartement is owned by my landlord. \nAnd tbh, I do think I'm a model renter. I pay on time. I had the boiler cleaned right away. When the drain of the dishwasher broke, I had it replaced. I maintain the drains as well because that was obviously never done. \nIf he asks for a metre stand I send it to him the same day with a picture and all. \nAnd ofc I maintain and clean everything. I even bought a special cleaning mop for the wooden floors. \nAnd I never drilled a hole. We use removeable hangers for pictures and such. \n\nMy landlord has also never contacted me about a complaint? So I assume he actually never even received a complaint. \nSo that would mean my neighbour threatened to do it. \n\nBut I am not drilling holes. I use a smoothie blender for like 20 seconds every evening at 7pm. \nAnd I don't think you can really hear a blender that loudly throughout a building. Let alone a floor up. \nI do have to say, that neighbour has his door standing open a lot and the hallway resonates sound. So maybe thats how he hears it?", "Yup, when he is awake his front door is open. \nUntil our first argument I never had even met him or knew who he was.\nAll I knew was that a couple on the 2nd floor argued daily, front door open and stuff came down the stairs. \n\nIt was the day of our first argument they pointed out to me that he was the one who was making noise in the hallway all the time and having a screaming match with his wife.", "She got a message from a building manager that stated that while he thought she was right in believing that her dogs were not creating a noise disturbance earlier in the night, he thought her response to her neighbor telling him to see a doctor was out of line.", "It's an editing error, I didn't notice it when I read the OP. It's missing a \"saying that\" or a set of quotation marks.", "One of the neighbours oversees the building. Like lights, when windows need to be cleaned, etc. \nIf there is an argument, we go to him as well. \n\nHe texted me at 6am that I was rude to tell the other guy he needed a doctor if he heard dogs bark while.... well they weren't. \n\nEnglish isn't my first language, sorry.", "My educated guess: OP received a message from the building manager. The building manager did not agree with the AH neighbor but thought OP crossed the line by telling AH neighbor they needed to go see a doctor.", "OP, maybe try the whole post again. It is all over the place with, well, everything.", "He has demanded one time I would come up to talk to him after our first argument. But I was extremely upset since he was talking about having my dogs put down and I refused to go into his demand.... \n\nI have talked to the other neighbours and nobody else is bothered by our dogs. They also say they barely bark and if they bark it is once or twice. \n\nI don't even know what set him off this time. I go to bed at 22h00.... we were all asleep.", "It is a thing in the building where we all have each others number for when there is an issue. Like to inform the elevator isn't working, or the window cleaner is coming then.... \nOr even more serious things, if someone falls that they can reach us for help. \n\nI know it really wasn't nice to tell him that but tbh, getting a text at 3 am that tells me to get my dogs quiet... ? While they were, was just annoying and maybe pissed me off a bit he went after my dogs again.", "He could be having alcohol induced dementia as well.", "And this is why he's the AH. *He* is the noisy one. *He* is actively disturbing everyone in the building. *He* is making his private and personal life everyone's else's problem by having frequent arguments with his spouse in the shared spaces of the apartment (aka the stairs), all the while complaining about everyone else and demanding they do as they say. *He is the problem.*\n\nYes, saying he needs a doctor directly to him is rude. But at this point it's clearly visible that he needs help, and he's too busy making his issues everyone else's problem to get it. You are not the AH - but be careful of how you proceed. He is well aware you don't like him now, and probaly will take the doctor comment as a personal insult. It is likely he will make it a living hell for you, and your dogs may likely take the blunt of the blows.\n\nMake sure you have a support network in the rest of your neighbors and talk to your landlord about his (the problem neighbor, not the landlord) behaviour - especially the consistently open door. Make a note of every time he and his spouse argue while the door is open, and every time he goes out to disturb a neighbor to yell at them. Highlight the times he targets the elderly or disabled. Note date and approximate times. It may not ever be necessary, but if the police ever get involved it is an excellent starting point for them to grasp the situation and work off of.\n\nI am astonished your landlord hasn't already evicted him. He's making the entire complex unsafe and will single-handedly ruin whatever community the landlord is trying to nurture.", "Yes, that one! I will edit it. How can I say it correctly?", "ESH\n\nMy concern is what it means if you were to say a particular thing to your neighbor over and over again, even in self-defense, since you say you don't intend to respect your neighbor or apologize to him. And the one part I think goes go too far is saying he needs to see a doctor. Done repeatedly, that would be a type of discriminatory harassment that would not apply with any other part of what you said or how you said it. It's very dirty arguing. Even \"What the hell is wrong with you\" is a little softer than \"you should see the doctor\"\n\nI frankly think that if every single interaction of his is rude and abusive, then there's not much you can do to communicate information to him except by being \"rude\" in your manner. That said, it is still important to say only what needs to be said that will actually be important.", "NTA and a trip to the police to report the threats made against your animals.", "Oowz... that could create problems eventually. \nMe and alcoholics don't go well together :') \n\nBut it coulf explain why he is awake at 3 am and then sleep until noon.", "I never said that before. \nBut he told me, at 3 am, that my dogs were barking. \nThey were dead asleep. My oldest was even sawing a log. \nThe middle one was asleep on my shoulder at the time I received the text. \nSo I don't know where he heard dogs barking, but it definately weren't mine. Nor did I hear anything outside tbh. \n\nI don't want to respect him anymore because of his behaviour. The first time he \"attacked\" was after he yelled at my autistic neighbour. I could hear him and the lady across the autistic neighbour talk and say: And those dogs have to go. \nNow I was a room away and heard that (btw my dogs hadn't madz a peep while they were that loud in the hallway) so I went out and told him to tell it to my face instead of behind my back. \nAnd he immediately went: Your dogs have to go. I will make sure they will be put down. \nI didn't even knew his name at that point! \nI got upset with him going like that and told him my dogs are not going anywhere. I left and talked to my neighbour across the hall (all crying) who told me about that yelling neighbour. She told me that the arguments I hear daily, the yelling is all him. He screams at his wife daily, their front door open. \nThere have even been times I was about to call the police because things were thrown down the stairs. \n\nAnd then we had a few times he came knocking on my door, we guessed to make the dogs bark. (Other neighbours and I have busted him on this) I then told him to stop knocking on my door unless he wants to talk to me. \n\nI refused to go upstairs because he came down and he told my bf that he demanded I came up to talk to him about my dog problem. (I am not a child nor a soldier....) \n\nAnd he also had a building vote on having the dogs shock collared because they were a nuisance. Which was denied because we have 12 people here. Only 2 are complaining. Him and that lady. \n\nBut it has been quiet for a while now, until last night. I was asleep, we all were, when my phone and watch woke me up at 3am. And that was him saying I had to make my dogs stop barking immediately. \nSorry, yes, might have been rude, but if you hear dogs barking while there isn't..... \n\nI think I am a nice person. I have bought a device that release a noise when the dogs bark. We have set candy everywhere so that, if there is a lot of noise, we can distract them so they don't bark. I'm home due to illness and if I go to sleep, so do my dogs. \nAnd unless I'm going to the hospital, or store, my dogs come with me. (Like visit grandpa, park, petstore and such) \nI even got home camera's with microphone that warn me if they bark, record it and then I can tell them to be quiet. \n\nBut texting me so rudely at 3am with a lie has now made me reach my limit. \n\nSomehow I think he has a view of my bf and me that is not stroking with reality.", "I have. But I have to have proof they said. \nIt's why I got a security camera. They told me I have to record it, but only inside my appartement I'm also allowed to record... \nSo it is an entire puzzle of what I had to do but basically I just need to have the door a bit open now to record it if he threatens my dogs again.", "Bingo.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and sleeps like a duck\u2026", "I have never even thought of that :o\nTy"]}
