{"id": 10558, "submission_id": "118blbz", "title": "AITA for lashing out on my friend for inviting someone to her party who speaks the same language as my boyfriend?", "selftext": "I (f27) have been with my boyfriend Jose (m30) for the past 9 months. We live in England but Jose is Portuguese. I attended my friend\u2019s (Louise, f28) birthday party last weekend. There was like 25 people there including Fiona.\n\nAt one point, I went outside looking for Jose and he was chatting with Fiona and another guy, James. Surprisingly, they were chatting in Portuguese. They switched to English and I asked how they knew Portuguese and they said they were uni mates (they\u2019re not together) and did a degree in Spanish which also required them to learn Brazilian Portuguese, apparently it\u2019s a thing in some unis.\n\nDidn\u2019t think much of it and went inside with Jose but all throughout the night, I kept seeing Jose chatting to Fiona and James (mostly Fiona) and I felt incredibly excluded and ditched (I don\u2019t speak Portuguese, it\u2019s too difficult and I don\u2019t have the time to learn another language right now).\n\nAt one point, I saw her talking to Jose again, I\u2019ve had enough, I told her to stop trying to impress anyone with her broken Portuguese and to fuck away from my boyfriend. Jose took Fiona\u2019s side and had the gut to defend her. I told him he\u2019s delusional if he thinks he\u2019s allowed to defend her and he told me to calm down. I tried to talk to him but he went inside and grabbed his stuff and left (I later found out that he joined others at a pub later on).\n\nAfter he left, I was still annoyed, I found Louise and told her that she\u2019s not my best friend anymore and asked her how could she had betrayed me like that. She acted all innocent and I told her that she knew what she did, plotted to invite Fiona because she never liked me being with Jose and it was disgusting of her.\n\nLouise was drunk and she told me to fuck off. I repeated myself and told her it\u2019s cruel to go behind her friends back and plot against them and it\u2019s cruel to so so in front of everyone. I admit, I might have shouted at her but she was being obtuse on purpose and I had to get her to understand.\n\nShe told me to leave but I said that I need an apology first. She told me she wouldn\u2019t give me one and called me an asshole and threatened to call the police if I wouldn\u2019t leave. Humiliating much? She was the bad guy but wanted to call the police on me. I grabbed my stuff and left. A few hours later, I saw snaps from all of them at the pub, including Jose. In the morning, I saw the birthday group chat from last night and she was complaining what an asshole I was an apologizing to everyone. Some people agreed with her and told her it wasn\u2019t her fault and she didn\u2019t need to apologize which is ridiculous. I messaged and said that she still owes me an apology and she messaged back saying she doesn\u2019t apologize to assholes and kicked me out of the chat.\n\nWorst part is, I told my sister and she agrees with Louise and told me I am the asshole and I owe them an apology. I am so conflicted. Was I the asshole for lashing out on Louise?", "created_utc": 1677002260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118blbz/aita_for_lashing_out_on_my_friend_for_inviting/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you 27, or 12?!?!\nFirst of all, speaking in your own language to someone after speaking a foreign language every day all day must be a massive relief to someone away from home- your boyfriend was probably just enjoying the chance to have a conversation he didn\u2019t have to translate. Your jealousy is beyond immature. He was literally having a conversation with a party guest. Should he have just stood by the wall alone all night?! Of course he was taking to someone else- who cares what language it was in? You even mentioned that they switch to English when you were around, so clearly they were not excluding you or anyone else. \n\nI can\u2019t even figure out why this is an issue- I can only assume you\u2019re afraid your boyfriend will realize that other women are more willing to learn his language and recognize that maybe you two aren\u2019t right for each other.\n\nETA: being mad at your friend is also incredibly weird- she invited her friend to a party. Because it was her party. Do you expect all of your friends to screens their guests in case one of them MIGHT make you jealous? This is a \u201cyou\u201d problem, not a \u201cher\u201d problem.

We live in England but Jose is Portuguese. I attended my friend\u2019s (Louise, f28) birthday party last weekend. There was like 25 people there including Fiona.\n\nAt one point, I went outside looking for Jose and he was chatting with Fiona and another guy, James. Surprisingly, they were chatting in Portuguese. They switched to English and I asked how they knew Portuguese and they said they were uni mates (they\u2019re not together) and did a degree in Spanish which also required them to learn Brazilian Portuguese, apparently it\u2019s a thing in some unis.\n\nDidn\u2019t think much of it and went inside with Jose but all throughout the night, I kept seeing Jose chatting to Fiona and James (mostly Fiona) and I felt incredibly excluded and ditched (I don\u2019t speak Portuguese, it\u2019s too difficult and I don\u2019t have the time to learn another language right now).\n\nAt one point, I saw her talking to Jose again, I\u2019ve had enough, I told her to stop trying to impress anyone with her broken Portuguese and to fuck away from my boyfriend. Jose took Fiona\u2019s side and had the gut to defend her. I told him he\u2019s delusional if he thinks he\u2019s allowed to defend her and he told me to calm down. I tried to talk to him but he went inside and grabbed his stuff and left (I later found out that he joined others at a pub later on).\n\nAfter he left, I was still annoyed, I found Louise and told her that she\u2019s not my best friend anymore and asked her how could she had betrayed me like that. She acted all innocent and I told her that she knew what she did, plotted to invite Fiona because she never liked me being with Jose and it was disgusting of her.\n\nLouise was drunk and she told me to fuck off. I repeated myself and told her it\u2019s cruel to go behind her friends back and plot against them and it\u2019s cruel to so so in front of everyone. I admit, I might have shouted at her but she was being obtuse on purpose and I had to get her to understand.\n\nShe told me to leave but I said that I need an apology first. She told me she wouldn\u2019t give me one and called me an asshole and threatened to call the police if I wouldn\u2019t leave. Humiliating much? She was the bad guy but wanted to call the police on me. I grabbed my stuff and left. A few hours later, I saw snaps from all of them at the pub, including Jose. In the morning, I saw the birthday group chat from last night and she was complaining what an asshole I was an apologizing to everyone. Some people agreed with her and told her it wasn\u2019t her fault and she didn\u2019t need to apologize which is ridiculous. I messaged and said that she still owes me an apology and she messaged back saying she doesn\u2019t apologize to assholes and kicked me out of the chat.\n\nWorst part is, I told my sister and she agrees with Louise and told me I am the asshole and I owe them an apology. I am so conflicted. Was I the asshole for lashing out on Louise?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can understand some jealousy because he was talking a bit to much to that girl, even if it was just because of the language, but at that point, where you said you called your friend no longer your best friend and she invited that girl on purpose I had to check your age again because I had to imagine how ridiculous it would be if this happened in my friend group, because I'm 27 too \ud83d\ude02 it was her party and she can invite whoever she wants and he can talk to who ever he wants.", "YTA\n\nYou might want to find a therapist and find out if you have a personality disorder", "What did I just read? Is this real? How do you function every day? How do you still have- had friends?", "You are a HUGE AH. Jealous much? Immature much? Do you act batshit crazy every time your boyfriend speaks to a woman? He did nothing wrong, Louise did nothing wrong. If you are going to be so petty and crazy jealous, you shouldn't be in a relationship. You should be completely embarrassed.", "YTA, she had the nerve to call it \"your broken Portuguese\" when she said it was \"Too difficult\" to learn it. You're the AH for everything. WTH you are so ignorant. I'm surprised OP HAD any friends to begin with.", "YTA I hope Fiona treats him better. \ud83d\ude01", "YTA, not surprised you can't handle Portuguese when you can barely write in English.", "I couldn't even get through half of this... \n\nThere is some incredibly delusional thinking going on here. Your friend wasn't conspiring against you. Your boyfriend doesn't need your permission to talk to someone else in his native language or to defend someone that you attacked for no reason. \n\nYou need help.\n\nYTA", "How is this even real? How can a person be 27 and think or act this way? YTA", "You're an ass.  YTA.", "No way this is real\u2026 but if it is, yes, YTA \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Girl be so for real right now. Obviously YTA. You thought your friend invited someone to her birthday party to pilfer your boyfriend because she.....spoke the same language as him? A language that quite literally MILLIONS of people speak. And instead of seeing a nice little moment of your boyfriend, who probably doesn't get the chance to socialize in his native language often, blending in seamlessly with your friends and acquaintances you decide to accuse him and your friend of plotting against you. It is incredibly lonely for people to not be able to share communication in their mother tongue, and sure you may be busy but you have made it clear you aren't even going to TRY to learn for him. And what are you going to do if you ever visit his home country? Are you going to throw a tantrum at every woman who speaks Portuguese to him? Do you expect him to do the same and start fights with every store attendant or tourist that speaks to you in English while you're there because OBVIOUSLY if they speak english to you that means they're trying to steal you away from him right???? God forbid a cashier tells you to have a nice day in English while you're there. I bet he will jump over the counter and pummel him right there for daring to harass you with your native language. Apologize to everyone involved here for being delusional and just pray that any of them ever speak to you again.", "Thinking this has to be fake. But if not YTA and I\u2019m pretty sure other comments will tell you why", "How did you write this out and still think you still deserve an apology?", "YTA are you seriously 27? How embarrassing for you. You acted like a complete lunatic and came up with a deeply paranoid conspiracy in your head then burned a friendship bridge because of your own massive insecurities. The only good thing here is that you let Louise know what a terrible friend you are", "This cannot be a real post lmao. Df is wrong with you?", "YTA You sound like an immature teenager for not being able to see your bf talk to someone in his native language. This is such weird, possessive, crazy behavior I don't even know what else to say to you other than you should look for a psychological evaluation", "\u2018After he left, I was still annoyed, I found Louise and told her she\u2019s not my bestfriend anymore\u2019\nI lol\u2019d. OP is clearly still in her highschool drama days\nI just have to ask out of curiousity\ud83d\ude06 \nAsberger? YTA", "YTA. And for you to practice a little portuguese: voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma cuzona.", "Wow", "YTA you are jealous, insecure, and rude.", "Your not upset because they speak the same language. Your upset because you were jealous and felt excluded because you thought that your bf and Fiona constant talking and the fact that you cannot understand what they were saying, meant they could possibly be flirting and it was driving you crazy.  But overall you sound crazy especially projecting all of that on your friend", "You even admit in the title to \u201clashing out\u201d on your friend. That was very high school of you for someone who is as old as you are. You also seem to be very ignorant to the The constant mental, emotional and even physical energy it takes to be constantly translating in your head. Which is a LOT. Your boyfriend was probably just so happy to have a conversation where he didn\u2019t have to worry about that. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t learn a couple sentences or words to make your boyfriend feel more at home and show you care. I get learning a new language can be time consuming but a) no one said you have to be fluent and I\u2019m sure if you asked your boyfriend he\u2019d be overjoyed to help you learn some basics and b) is it too hard? Or too time consuming? The way you\u2019ve worded it sounds more like it\u2019s too hard or too much of a burden rather it being more an issue of time. If you can\u2019t have sympathy for your boyfriend as a foreigner and learning a new language himself, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be together.", "There is no fucking way this is real.", "YTA, I mean honestly how pathetic can you get. You humiliated yourself so you have no one to blame but yourself. You owe everyone an apology for your own entitled behaviour. It's not your ex-boyfriend or friends fault that you're lazy, entitled and a racist.", "Oh booo hooo there are other people, nationalities and languages in the world. How could anglophones ever cope???\n\nYTA.", "Yes\nYes you are TA \n\nAnd among other things", "Definitely YTA.  If you can't handle your boyfriend talking to another woman I think you need to work on your trust issues before having a relationship.  Also kicking off at your friend and accusing her of trying to sabotage your relationship is crazy.", "YTA. OMG, huge AH to everyone at that party.", "Yta", "how can you even question being the asshole in this???", "YTA. Your boyfriend is allowed to have friends and also is allowed to make friends. The fact that you thought Fiona was trying to steal your boyfriend just because she speaks some of his native tongue sounds like extreme jealousy. You just lost your whole friend group... and most likely also your boyfriend. Your behavior screams \" I'm crazy\" and it's a huge red flag. Get some therapy. This is entirely a you problem", "Why do I think a bored teenager wrote this? I'm not even voting; that would give it a dignity it doesn't deserve.", "YTA. Your boyfriend was probably lonely and excited that some people spoke his language! Louise certainly didn't deserve to be given out to either.", "Yeah YTA.", "Yta \n\nHe was probably excited to actually get to speak his native language, and you ruined it with your insecurities. If you're that uncomfortable with having a partner who speaks a different language then be with someone who doesn't speak a different language, or MAKE the time to learn his language. What happens when you reach the point of having kids (if you're not child free)? Are you going to ostracize your child from a significant portion of his culture, or just not learn and struggle to communicate with your child while they're learning code switching?", "YTA. You owe them all an apology for your bizarrely jealous, controlling and insecure tantrum", "YTA your absolutely pathetic yelling at the poor girls because your insecure go see a professional", "I don't know whether t laugh or to cry.  Might just do both.", "This is hysterical.\n\nAs a fellow Portuguese person in England, your ex had my sympathy.\n\nYTA", "are you delusional? of course, yta!", "YTA and is something wrong with you?\n\nAre you drunk while typing this?", "YTA. \n\n>I don\u2019t speak Portuguese, it\u2019s too difficult and I don\u2019t have the time to learn another language right now\n\nSo are very insecure about your boyfriend but also not willing to put in the time to learn one of the languages he speaks? He probably just enjoyed being able to speak his first language for a while and you made it weird.\n\nIn lashing out at your friend and then further dragging it out through the group chat you've likely lost most of that friendship group.", "YTA", "YTA\nJust because your not able to learn Portuguese it doesn't mean people can't learn...\nI mean this lightly but you have a serious problem.\nAlso who are you to tell your grown boyfriend what he is or not allowed to do.  And if I were Jose or your friend I would ditch your a**. This is psychotic.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019re too insecure to let your boyfriend speak to someone in his NATIVE LANGUAGE you clearly have some jealousy issues you need to work on. Louise was not conspiring against you, you blew the situation out of proportion.", "YTA very much", "How did you write this whole thing without realizing that you're the ah?", "YTA- I don't even know where to start. I don't think your friend betrayed you by inviting another person who speaks the same language as your partner. They were talking because it probably feels nice to find someone who speaks Portuguese in the area. Major, YTA for getting mad and BF and friend. You chastised her in front of her friends, at her party and then wanted an apology.", "YTA. Holy cow you suck.", "You need three things ASAP:\n\n1. Grown up\n2. Learn that someone's birthday party it is not a about you\n3. Therapy.\n\nAnd of course, YTA.", "YTA. Did anyone see the green-eyed monster at the party? Sure, sounds like one was there.", "YTA. Do you not trust your boyfriend enough to let him speak Portuguese with someone else? Your friend doesn't owe you anything. You are a piece of work.", "Way too much tbh", "When she told Louise she was no longer her best friend I finally had to scroll back up to verify her age. It was all so juvenile and I\u2019m over here thinking it couldn\u2019t get much worse. I felt her stomping her feet when her sister doesn\u2019t even agree with her!", "7 actually", "I think after the party Jose is probably the ex boyfriend", ">This is like some cliche plot in a sitcom\n\nThat's just most of this sub. I'd guess only like 40% of these stories are actually real.", "Please, I'm newer here. May I have a crumb of context?", "I had this same exact thought!", "Ex bf", "At what point did you scroll back up to double check her age? For me it was the \u201cyou\u2019re not my best friend anymore!\u201d I assumed we were dealing with 12 year olds at that point.", "My thoughts exactly.. could be ahole clickbait.. no one is that obtuse lol YTA", "OP sounds even younger than that. \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend anymore\u201d is what my son used to say in Pre-K when we made him stop playing and eat dinner.", "Lousie and Jose should both dump her and become best friends.", "\u201cBefore you lose your friends and bf\u201d \n\nId argue that ship has probably sailed\u2026", "Exactly this. My first language is French and (although I'm completely fluent in English) its often so refreshing and comforting when there's someone who speaks the same dialect of French as me. OP is definitely the AH and owes an apology to all of the people listed in this story. Especially given that they switched back to English when she walked in shows that there was no intent to exclude her shows just how  massively entitled & self-centred OP is in this scenario.", "Literally my first thought based off the title alone\ud83d\udc80", "Initially, it seemed like youthful jealousy and fomo, but by the end, it was full-blown crazy.", "I have a feeling that they are not willing to have her in their life even with an apology.\n\n\nYTA", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 thank you for this!!", "Link?", "More like 7", "I had to go back to see the real age of the poster. It sounds middle school shit.", "Op, as someone with paranoia that takes medication, part of me can see exactly why you thought this. Please talk to a doctor and get some help. Trust me, you'll feel so much better!", "I'm not sure your TA.... but you need to grow up.", "I legit don't think this is real. But entertaining read, 10/10 would read again", "Honestly I think you\u2019re right. It reads almost exactly like the one about the girl who accused her roommate of speaking other languages for attention at a party or the one who got ostracized/fired at her college job for the same thing.", "You know, I speak Spanish, and not a syllable of Portuguese, yet I was able to understand every word. I feel motivated to learn now", "It\u2019s definitely hard to believe someone could earnestly type this out about themselves, all the facts included, and still ask if they are the AH.", "Yta\n\nWhat did I just read? Lol Get over yourself.", "Did you mean to put that OP was Not The AH here? The rest of the post past your judgement makes it seem like you wanted to rule YTA", "On Wednesdays, she wears pink.", "Check out r/TheSpanishIvySaga, it has all her posts on this. This one hasn\u2019t been added yet so I totally may be jumping to conclusions and it\u2019s not related. Still, an interesting read if you wanna check it out. I love the unsupportive sister, she\u2019s my favorite character lol", "I think he's best friends with Fiona now.", "\u201cYouthful jealousy\u201d was my first impression as well. Until I realized this is a grown ass woman. Now im thinking some kind of personality disorder, she literally blew up her relationship with a whole friend group and her bf in one day over an issue she made up in her head. That\u2019s unhinged.", "That would be wise of them.", "I did. Thanks for catching that.", "Agree!! Absolutely torched her personal and social life over this."]}
