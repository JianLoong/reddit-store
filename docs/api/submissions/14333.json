Or at least haven\u2019t admitted to the world.", "Why didn\u2019t you just sit on your boyfriends lap", "NTA. He should have offered his lap if he was so offended, or got off and waited with you, probably with K too", "Wait, wait, wait, your BF preferred you to wait on an isolated trail, alone, in the dark, rather than offering to either stay and wait with you for the next ride or offering to let you sit on his lap, but then got mad when you took K\u2019s offer of his lap?  NTA.", "In my world, there were two solutions.\n\n1: K left with the truck, B waited with you for the next truck.\n\n2: B invited you to sit on his lap.\n\nYour BF(?) chose neither, take that as a sign.", "I can understand him not liking that you sat in another guys lap, but he didn\u2019t make room for you or let you take his seat while HE waited for the next ride. and he didn\u2019t offer his own lap either. What kind of asshole bf would expect you to wait by yourself for the next ride? He even could of offered to wait with you! NTA! He was the only one embarrassed. I probably would of sat in his friends lap too since he offered, just to make him mad for being that horrible of a bf, and then dumped him after.", "Boyfriend basically had two viable options here:\n\n\"Hey, sit on MY lap\"\n\nor\n\n\"Sit here, I'll wait for the next ride.\"", "No person that loves, or even remotely cares about you would do what your Boyfriend did. and then he had the nerve to be mad at you and ask for an apology?\n\nFor your own sake and safety I would break this relationship off.. no partner should put you in danger.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Also, be careful here. Did K actually say anything that suggested that he was upset or embarrassed? Or just your bf? Do you ever talk to K directly, or is it always through B?\n\nBecause it sounds like B is actually the one who is embarrassed, and is just using K as a scapegoat here. Because K offered a solution that B wasn't willing to. \n\nI would also be concerned about the fact that he keeps inviting K to things, is K asking to come, or is B inviting/insisting he come? \n\nYour bf is creating a very odd dynamic here\n\nBeyond that, your bf is regularly sacrificing your comfort (and on this occasion, safety) to his fear of confrontation. Which isn't acceptable. \n\nDo you have a way to contact K? Because I would test the waters, reach out, explain that you didn't want to wait alone in the dark for the next one, and his was the only solution offered, but you apologise for embarrassing him. See what he says. B may be controlling what each of you hears about the other.", "ESH your boyfriend is an idiot and you\u2019re clueless and tacky", "Girl\u2026 B is a major fucking asshole lmao. And K has a crush on you - it also doesn\u2019t really seem like you hate him that much when you felt compelled to describe his \u201cbig eyes, cute button nose and adorable smile\u201d, especially since you later defended him in the comments saying he was very nice about you sitting on his lap during the ride lol. This seriously reads like fanfiction.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Additionally, NtGF. \n\nYou deserve better than a jerk who will literally strand you alone in the middle of nowhere. He does not care about you to the point he would leave you vulnerable to harm rather than spend time with you. \n\nThis is not a you problem. This is a him problem. Get rid of your him problem.", "NTA", "When your boyfriend is a people pleaser and will please literally anyone but you. Lol \n\nYikes. You didn't seem to embarrass his friend either, he offered and was even nice about it. Your boyfriend was upset because you sat on his boyfriends lap \u2639\ufe0f", "Your boyfriends friend is his boyfriend. That\u2019s why he\u2019s \u2018teasing\u2019 you. That\u2019s why it was ok to be left behind. NTA, but the other two are!", "NTA omg, your boyfriend wanted you to wait 2 hours, in the dark, by yourself? Oof. That's rough, buddy.", "How long would you have been waiting for a ride, alone?  B was willing to let you stay alone?  Why couldn't K wait for the next ride since he drove separately?\n\nB should have been the partner and stayed with you if there wasn't enough room.\n\nNTA  but rethink you relationship with B.", "Bf is an asshole and expected you to wait alone", "NTA you gotta dump this sorry excuse for boyfriend if he is willing to leave you to wait 2 hrs for another ride. Who was he on a date on really? Cos it sounds like you was the third wheel", "Please break up with B. He doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with you and is too cowardly to tell you. Tell him you will only apologise if he breaks up with you.", "B and K are dating.", "NTA. However your boyfriend and his bully BF both are. To repeat what everyone else is saying - I cannot believe he told you to wait alone, for the next ride! And after that wouldn't squish up so you could share a seat! How on earth did you embarass his friend?  \nYour boyfriend is the immature one, and isn't boyfriend material.", "His button-nose friend lol", "Seriously, this guy is 25 and doesn\u2019t know basic decency towards his SO? Wish him a happy life with K and free yourself of him.\n\nNTA, at all.", "My husband would absolutely never suggest I wait alone in the dark for hours by myself. That is just ridiculous and not something normal people do to someone they hate let alone care about.", "Ha ha ha \ud83d\ude02 this made my day", "button-nose friend \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "OP... so your BF sounds like he likes his friend more than you. Are you sure they aren't dating and you're some kind of cover? I would not stay with a guy who kept inviting his mean/jealous friend to all your dates, and who seems to not care about what happens to you.", "I also thought it sounded like there was something else between B & K. Lol.", "Her bf was being a total prick and she wasn\u2019t in the mood for jokes since she was so exhausted. Sitting on his friend\u2019s lap is not even 1% as bad as him genuinely telling her to wait in the dark, in the middle of the woods, alone for 2h. \n\nAll that said, OP and K definitely have the hots for each other lmao", "yes! I need to see how this ends.", "I was thinking the same thing, lmao", "It was a sarcastic/joke way of describing him, like he\u2019s an angel who\u2019s a total asshole lol", "Literally her only other option was waiting alone in the dark for two hours...", "He is not just a \"friend\" lol", "And would BF have waited at the car or whatever for OOP? Or just gone home and expected her to catch a bus or whatever?", "The more I exist in the modern world the more I appreciate my grandmas insistence that women should have good quality purses and frying pans. You never know when you might need a melee weapon.", "This post reminds me of another post I saw here a few months ago.\n\nIt was about a woman and her boyfriend, and how the boyfriend was actually in a sexual relationship with his best friend (both are men), and that their \"guys trips\" together was them going away from her to have sex with each other.", "I believe K was sincere.  When he saw B was going to make you wait alone in the dark for two hours he did what B should have done.  His momma raised him right.", "K: \u201csit on my lap\u201d\n\nOP: \u201cthat\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll just sit on your lap B\u201d\n\nB: \u201cCool, whatever.\u201d\n\nEasy.", "I was also wondering that since they clearly rode together. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering what K said to OP after she sat on his lap. I can\u2019t imagine they didn\u2019t say anything to each other the whole 50 minutes while she sat on top of him. She would know if *he*  (K) felt that she \u201cembarrassed\u201d him by taking him up on his offer to sit on his lap.", "Let's not forget, B is controlling what OP knows, and therefore thinks about K. So it is logical to assume that B is also controlling what K knows/thinks about OP. \n\nIt doesn't seem that OP and K have communication outside of what B says to each of them about the other.", "That's what I got, and if K is like that because he likes her. I'm pretty sure it's a crush. Source: I was 13 for a year once upon a time.", "Oh my god \ud83e\udd23", "READ THE POST \n\nThe time line goes as ; OP asks B if she can sit on his lap, he declines. As she's walking off the ride K says \"Sit on my lap\" and she does.", "No, she asked him to make space. Not sit on his lap."]}
