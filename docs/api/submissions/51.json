I asked Chelsea when she was looking to have her wedding and she told me she already picked a date and it was in July 2024 - only 1 week after my wedding. When I told her the date I wanted, she called her venue and moved it another week out, but that still only leaves our weddings 2 weeks apart. I told her I wouldn't be able to make it since I'll probably still be on my honeymoon and she said she was okay with it, but I was annoyed that she's so nonchalant with me not being able to attend. \n\nThe plan was to have each other as bridesmaids so I asked her to be mine, but she didn't ask me because I won't be at the wedding, which I get, but now it feels like I'm no longer part of the friend group.\n\nA few months ago, she texts me and my friends that she's having a dinner to celebrate her engagement and I told her I couldn't make it because I had a trip planned. On the day of my trip, my flight got delayed to the next day so I could've attended, but I didn't know when or where the dinner was because she never even bothered to send me an official invite. \n\nThroughout the last few months, she's been texting our group chats trying to plan her bridal shower and bachelorette, but I didn't respond because I was still hurt about not being invited to the dinner and I just got busy with work. On facebook, I see that she posts a confirmation email of her booking her Miami bach trip with our friends, but didn't bother texting me separately to see if I could come. \n\nIt feels like she's been excluding me so I called her and told her that I no longer wanted her to be my bridesmaid because I was still mad our dates were so close together. She knows I'm still trying to get my teaching credentials and have no other times to get married so I don't know why she's in such a rush to get married. Ever since then, she's been hanging out with our friends without me and making it very apparent that I'm excluded. \n\nAITA for kicking her our of my bridal party when she hasn't been including me?", "created_utc": 1667276037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiyg24/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_bridal_party/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would she send an invite?\nYOU can't go to the wedding... why ask for you to be a bridesmaid or even an invitation. \nYOU ignore the group texts. \n\nDon't act like the victim. You aren't. \n\nIf you exclude her from your wedding, that's on you. However your are the one who excluded yourself from her and anything going on with her wedding.\n\nShe did nothing wrong. Even went as far as to move her wedding date a week FOR YOU!", "It is incredible, the way you expect your friend to bend over backwards in order to center you in her wedding plans when you've made zero moves to compromise and adjust to her schedule. \n\nYTA, and a massive one.", "YTA - go back and re-read the long story you told us all about repeatedly canceling on her or declining invites, then review the part where she got engaged first and already had a date picked out but you still opted to be combative and pissy about it. Then after she does what any normal, well-adjusted person would do and moves forward with her planning without you since you\u2019re unavailable, you jettison her from your own wedding party in a wildly immature move. You need to look inward.", "YTA - she had been super accommodating and you sound like a jealous asshole who is to busy for her.\n\nyeah, you are totally in the wrong.", "YTA??? \n\nLet me lay this out. \n\nShe got engaged first, started planning her wedding first, and set a date first. You then set yours a week prior, and she is generous enough to move her (already planned!) date back by a week to accommodate you. Despite this, you tell her you cannot go. (guess you just have to have a 2week honeymoon immediately after the wedding huh).\n\nShe is understanding, and graciously still accepts when you ask her to be your MOH, even though this means she will be heavily involved in prepping for your wedding while her own is right around the corner. \n\nShe invites you to the celebration dinner, and you say you cannot go to that either. When your plans change last minute, you do not text her to tell her you can come after all. Instead, you get annoyed with her for not psychically knowing this and sending you details. \n\nShe continues to include you in the chat planning events leading up to the wedding, but you ignore her. At no point do you indicate to her that you are remotely interested in attending any events. You then get upset when she does not expect you to attend. \n\nYou get so angry she hasn't included you in things you willingly opted out of, that you kick her out of your bridal party. Why on earth are you surprised she doesn't want to hang out with you anymore? You repeatedly indicated you didn't care about her wedding or needs, and got mad at *her* for not magically knowing how best to cater her life to your schedule. And then punished her for it. \n\nYTA and a horrible friend.", "WHY do weddings bring out the worst in people???\n\nYTA. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. She got engaged first and chose a date first. \n\n2. You then announced your engagement and preferred date. She agreed to move her date by a week (which is above and beyond what she has to do)\nAnd you STILL complain that it was \u2018only\u2019 two weeks later. \n\n3. You told her you wouldn\u2019t attend and were sulky when she didn\u2019t fall to her knees begging you to come. \n\n4. She sounds like she has managed the situation with grace and patience. You, on the other hand, have been openly mopey and difficult. Honestly, you sound exhausting. \n\n5. You booted her out of your wedding and then have the audacity to be cross that she isn\u2019t including you in her life. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be insulting here, but if I could offer a thought: step back and try to see this from her perspective. For both of you, your own wedding is more important - that\u2019s understandable! But show a little maturity and empathy and step into your next life stage without all this needless drama.", "She rescheduled her wedding for you.  She\u2019s not excluding you, you just aren\u2019t a part of the bridal party because you can\u2019t make it.\n\nWhy would you be invited to the bachelorette party?

Then get upset that you told her you couldn\u2019t come. YTA", "YTA, she dodged a bullet by getting rid of her as a friend. She doesn't have to put up with you anymore. She changed her wedding date that's over 1.5 years away. She sent you a text about the engagement dinner and you said you couldn't make it and then cry about not being invited when you clearly were. Your flight got canceled. You simply could have sent a text or called and told her good news about now being available and asking if they have room for you to still attend. I'm sure she would have made room for you. Then you double down and ignore her texts and wonder why you are being exculded from other plans. If you don't understand, I recommend you not become a teacher because you're not smart enough. \nYou are taking a 2 week honeymoon?. That is pretty long, but if you were a real friend you would have made it a bit shorter so you can attend her wedding.  You are a horrible friend who thinks everyone should cater to you.", "Yta- you want her to change her date to fit around you AFTER, she\u2019d already had the date. It\u2019s not her problem you have teaching credentials. You WERE invited to the meal but you declined and prioritised your trip, but are somehow annoyed about that after your trip fell through? You have then been ignoring all of your friend\u2019s comments on her wedding (and I\u2019m assuming you were expecting her to still care/ talk about yours), and somehow you think she is TA? If anything, it comes across that you have made no effort for her wedding and if I was her I would be annoyed with you. \n\nPS- you have no right to expect her to \u2018not be in a rush\u2019 and change her plans because you want to get married then. If it bothers you being so close, you wait until you are qualified/ next year and have it then. The level of entitlement in this post is astounding.", "YTA. \n\nShe tried to accommodate you firstly by pushing her entire wedding so that you would be happy. \n\nI understand feeling excluded but because you opted out of multiple events, she too would\u2019ve felt bad so I feel like it was your priority to make the first move in compromising and reaching out to her.", "Yta. You are the one excluding yourself. You said you couldn\u2019t go to the dinner so there is no reason for you to get an invite to that. If you wanted to go since you could, you should have talked to her. This is one. Two. You are rushing your marriage just as well. There is absolutely no reason to be a bridezilla and an asshole friend towards someone who was trying to get you involved. You denied everything. This is all your fault and yours alone. If she mattered to you at all, a week honeymoon would be done or move your dates. But stop blaming her for your bad behavior.", "Wow. YTA.\n\nShe moved her wedding date for you!!!\n\nYou said you can\u2019t make the wedding.\n\nYou said you couldn\u2019t make the dinner.\n\nYou didn\u2019t respond to any of the reach-outs about the shower & Bach party.\n\nGirl - you are excluding yourself, and being an asshole to boot getting mad at her for not changing her date further out when it was nice of her to move it at all in the first place!!\n\nYTA big time.", "YTA. And I wouldn\u2019t say July 2024 is a rush to get married. She moved it once. Why would she send an official invite to someone who said they couldn\u2019t come??? Did you message and say - change of plans is there a spare seat at the table? You\u2019ve not helped at all and this is all on you.", "YTA.\n\nSounds like you were butthurt from the moment that you planned your wedding and decided hers was too close to yours (one that it sounds like she had already planned first?). She already move the entire wedding to accommodate you and you still bailed. Then you said you couldn't go to an event for her wedding and got butthurt again. \n\nIf I were her, I would assume you were being pissy and I, quite frankly, wouldn't want you at my wedding events because you just seem bitter and I wouldn't want that vibe when I'm happy and trying to have fun. Weddings aren't the be-all-end-all of life. Its sad that you're messing up a friendship over this.\n\nEdit: a word", "YtA. You consistently told her you couldn't be there and somehow it's her fault she isn't sending you info for things you've given a no on? She pushed HER wedding which was already booked for you, and you still won't be at hers but expect to participate in all the things that her bridal party is doing? And what's HER rush? She got engaged first my dude, if you can only do it in the summer it sounds like you can put it off another year. Marriage is supposed to be a lifetime commitment, if you don't think you'll still have a wedding a year later it's a waste of time anyway. You have a very \"I need to be the center of the universe\" vibe going here.", "YTA\n\nYou are the one who has been telling her you can't make it to her events. You can't make it to her wedding, because you're on your honeymoon then. Chelsea took it well, but YOU were upset that she took it well and wasn't wailing about your absence. You couldn't make it to her engagement dinner, but still wanted her to tell you the place and time. You want to be included in her bachelorette stuff, but you won't even be in her wedding. It's like you want her to beg you to attend and you turn her down every time, when you're invited or included.\n\nThis friendship is pretty much ended and its because if you.", "YTA \n\nFirstly - your friend moved her date which she had before yours to somewhat accommodate you and yet you still not able to be there for her because you assuming you will still be on honeymoon.  Do you expect her to move her date even further back after waiting 7 years to marry the man of her dreams? For you? Why are you not moving tour date earlier in June so there could be more of a distance between your dates? If it bothers you so much? Then you could go on your honeymoon and still attend your friends wedding. \n\nSecondly- You make yourself unavailable by not responding to texts in the group chat, you didnt attend her dinner and you not planning on being at her wedding but you feel bad because she is continuing with her plans with her friends that are responding and showing up the the events she has planned. What exactly are you expecting from her? \n\n\nThirdly - None of these things you\u2019ve mentioned explains why you kicked her out of your bridal shower,  not once have you said that she hasn\u2019t been there for you, it you that has not been there for her but yet you punishing her? \n\nYour friend clearly knows that you a selfish person, to be only thinking about yourself and expecting everything to work on it your favour when it\u2019s not about just you! She is getting married too and its also a huge thing for her but you not considering any of her feels and her plans and thats exactly why she is nonchalant about all of this. \n\nI bet she wasnt too phased about being kicked out of your wedding too. \n\nYTA and it\u2019s really hard to believe that your best friend would even want you to be her friend moving forward because in this entire scenario- your feelings is all that matters to you and thats not how friendship works.", "YTA. Reading this was a master class in self-owning.", "YTA she literally first thing moved her wedding date, and all you\u2019ve done was complain.  She didn\u2019t send you an invite? You\u2019d already said you weren\u2019t going. Didn\u2019t invite you to the bachelorette party? You weren\u2019t going to go anyhow. You literally were in the group chat, and chose to ignore it. If you wanted to go, you\u2019d have said something.\n\nYou wanted to be able to keep telling her no, and she took that option from you.", "OP, sorry from that I'm reading, YTA. You're still upset at her wedding date though she tried to accommodate you, and the dinner you said you couldn't attend, because she didn't send you an official invite anyway. AND your upset she's not including you in her plans for the bridal shower and bachelorette, because you NEVER responded! Of course she's going to assume that you didn't want to go to Miami beach, but you wanted a separate text from her! Seriously what else do you want from her! She's probably happy that she's no longer going to be your bridesmaid given your selfish, entitlement, and drama. Please grow up and get a clue. YTA.", "What the actual... \n\nYTA. \n\nOh my lord are YTA. \n\nThis woman rescheduled her wedding around you, and you have the audacity to ask why she's in a rush to get married?\n\nSit down with a mutual friend, or someone you trust to set you right. Tell her you need a reality check. Lay this out for them and listen. \n\nYou need someone you trust and care about to help you see the light. Reddit won't be kind, which may mean you don't hear the punchline: you need an enormous dose of perspective.", "YTA\n\nThe way you talk about all of this makes you come across as very selfish. It's not a good look. \n\nRegardless you rejected her invitations over and over then are suprised she stopped inviting you.", "YTA\n\nYou want to continue to be taken into account in activities of a wedding to which you have already made it clear that you are not going to attend. You are only thinking of yourself.\n\nAdditionally, she didn't schedule her wedding to bother you, it was pure chance, she even changed the date for you.", "YTA In general from the sound of it.\n\nEdit after rereading: you were initially pissed that your friend didn\u2019t burst into tears and beg you to not miss her wedding? That she was nonchalant about it? Girl, that\u2019s so sad on your part. Also, it\u2019s a little disturbing.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t be bothered to be involved in her wedding, and now you\u2019re throwing a shocked Pikachu face that you\u2019re not involved with the wedding activities. You received an invite to the dinner, and you declined, so why would you receive the details in the first place?", "YTA - you\u2019re mad at her for excluding you from events you couldn\u2019t attend? \n\nShe moved her wedding date for you, and even then extremely casually said you couldn\u2019t go to her wedding. But you still expect to be involved in all the events\u2026 even the ones you can\u2019t go to? And when you don\u2019t respond to communication?\n\nWhere are you actually a good friend in this scenario? What part?", "You srsly need to be mature and *communicate* with her and not just do a lot of assuming.", "YTA - You\u2019ve made it clear about your busy schedule. Have said you couldn\u2019t make it multiple times yet still expect the invite? Grow up!", "YTA - it is ok for weddings to be close together, you are the one who needs a 2 week plus honeymoon. Everything she is not \"including\" you in is because you have said you can't be there or you are not responding. You sound very selfish and seem focused on the face that they have waited so long can't they wait longer to get married. Why does your wedding have to be next year? Why not wait another year since you are so focused on getting your teaching credentials this year?", "How is she sent me and my friends a text saying she was having a dinner to celebrate her engagement not an invite? If your plane was delayed, and you could have made it, why not text your friends to see where the dinner was? Maybe you could have surprised the bride? She didn\u2019t ask you about the bachelorette party because you were in the group chat and chose to ignore that part of the convo because you were hurt about not being invited to dinner, when you actually were.

And your response to her niceness was to say that you probably won\u2019t be able to come because you\u2019ll still be on your honeymoon. \n\nFor somebody who\u2019s so busy getting their credentials, you seem to be able to take a lot of time off for your honeymoon.

You owe HER an apology.", "YTA\n\nCan\u2019t you see your selfishness in this whole episode ?", "YTA, you rejected her invitations more than once!

Crazy huh?", "YTA - so to summarize the issues here\u2026 she moved her wedding date for you but that wasn\u2019t good enough.

Check in with a therapist, and mention borderline personality disorder. You might not have it, but you're definitely feeling things (betrayal, being pushed away, being dismissed) stronger than the situation warrants (scheduling conflicts).\n\nYou need to do some cognitive work on responsibility, and recognizing what is others' responsibility and what is your responsibility. When your flight was delayed and you because available for that party it was your responsibility to call or text her, and ask if you could come. \n\nIt's possible that she and the others might be pulling away from you. If so, it's because your behavior seems crazy to them. I would give her a call, and say you're sorry. Tell her you feel extremely insecure about missing each other's weddings, and that you think your insecurities led to you making the situation worse. Tell her you really don't want to lose her as a friend. She made a really big concession in moving her wedding date, so there's a good chance she will accept your apology.\n\nIf you find out you have BPD or any other emotional disorders you'll need to be honest and set expectations with those closest to you. \"I'm realizing my reactions were out of proportion with the situation. I'm working on getting better with a therapist, but I just want to acknowledge that I will may make the same mistake again. If I do, please tell me that I'm not reading the situation properly.

Great, plan now for 2025 so you have dibs then I guess? Or was that somehow not an option?\n\nAlso it sounds like you uninvited yourself from her dinner and then got pissy when she believed you. Why is that a slight against you? You told her you couldn't go. \n\nShe's probably wondering why her longterm friend has suddenly shifted into being a total bridezilla and is leaving more heavily on her other friends to try and make sense of your sudden shift into a romcom frenemy. \n\nI absolutely don't get why you think any of this is her doing at all.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with you? The lack of self awareness and the amount of sheer entitlement you\u2019re displaying here is staggering.", "YTA, lol, you're too self absorbed to be real. Get a grip on yourself - there's more to world than you and your wedding.", "YTA. \n\nShe moved her wedding date to accommodate you.  Instead of being grateful and thankful you were disappointed she didn't move it more.

When I told her the date I wanted, she called her venue and moved it another week out, but that still only leaves our weddings 2 weeks apart.

Ever since then, she's been hanging out with our friends without me and making it very apparent that I'm excluded. \n\nAITA for kicking her our of my bridal party when she hasn't been including me?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are very self-centered. She delayed her wedding by a week *for you.* She said she had *already* picked her date when you told her the date you wanted. You don't know why she's in a rush to get married? *We're talking about 2024!* In what world is that rushing? And that's just the beginning. You excluded yourself from the group text.

Did you make an attempt to reach out to her or anyone else you knew was attending? She texted your group chats (you know, the one with you in it) but you decided not to respond.

She moves her wedding date and you're not pleased. She tells everyone about a dinner she's planning and you're ticked that she didn't officially invite you to a dinner you just said you can't go to? You don't respond to any of her texts because your princess feelings are hurt and then you wonder why she's not inviting you? Wondering why she's in such a rush to get married?

It seems every time she invited you, you had excuses, \"I can't come to your wedding, I'll be away on my honeymoon\", \"I can't come to your engagement party, I have a trip planned\" and so on and so forth. Your honeymoon could have been postponed, the planned trip I get but you're not the good friend you believe you are.

OP needs help.", "Sometimes I think these posts are trolls. If not, you need medication, therapy, and a huge dose of self-awareness. The entitlement here is baffling and honestly embarrassing.

Why would she send you the details of a dinner you were invited to initially but told her you couldn\u2019t attend?

Chelsea hasn\u2019t chosen her date to spite you, she\u2019s picked the date that is best for her, fianc\u00e9 and their friends and family. She\u2019s already rescheduled it for you once.

Something changed so that you are able to attend said party, but you didn\u2019t reach out to let her know and get the details to attend.\n7. Although she has been texting in your group chat planning the details of the bridal shower/bachelorette party and you chose not to respond to ANY of those chats, you are upset that she booked the trip without reaching out to you separately ???\n\nYou are not her friend. You don\u2019t even sound like a good person. You sound like selfish, entitled brat and I hope she sees that and cuts all contact with you!", "YTA You create the drama in your head.
