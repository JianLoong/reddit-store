And op is an adult. Your birthday? Bfd, grow up.", "Of course! Why wouldn\u2019t they? They offer discounted prices because they aren\u2019t as popular as weekends.", "This. One of my cousins got married on a Tuesday because it was exactly 100 years since the day our great-grandparents got married. Venue was a third of the cost of a weekend event.", "Except the wedding\u2019s in July so it\u2019s probably Britain or Ireland.", "And they aren\u2019t getting married on her birthday.", "They aren't getting married on her birthday.", "The cool thing is that they\u2019re not getting married on her birthday.", "They aren't getting married on her birthday.", "Well, it can be that during the weekday the core family/OP has a small celebration, and a larger one with friends/family during the weekend. That's how my family always did it, anyway. For some, it is important to do something on their birthday, because long work day or not, that is the day they were born on, not the next, not the previous, not two weeks later on a weekend. And for many, round numbers like 30 are more significant.", "Hey, maybe! As someone who's not fussed about my birthday, I feel that way, it's perfectly fine for someone to feel differently, when with good reason.", "Yeah wedding date can be \u201cpicked\u201d but the point they are making is that it is not as easy as \u201cdecide which day you want to party\u201d you have to schedule vendors so they have to be available as well. That\u2019s food vendors, decor, music, photography, etc all independent of one another but need to be coordinated. Also venues are you know, booked up and not just waiting empty for your party? OP says \u201cthe summer is so long they could of picked any day!\u201d When I got married due to budget & location when it was said and done we had 2 weekends to pick from one on Aug and one end of June. That\u2019s it. Oh and you know, we\u2019re starting our lives together it\u2019s not just a party so we were looking for a place to live so cause of those factors were forced to pick June. So yeah after getting all that set up if my adult sister then calls me up and says \u201cboo hoo my 30th birthday is the day after your wedding, no fair! Why did you pick the day of my birthday to have your party?!\u201d My response is supposed to be \u201csilly me! You were born on this day 30 years ago?! I should definitely throw away all my plans and start from scratch so there\u2019s time for you to celebrate\u201d?", "It's more like, I don't care about birthdays and think it's too much of a fuss once you're old enough to drive. Or, the one who should be celebrated, is the mother of the child, who did all the hard work (and as a tradition, I try to make a cake or something with my mom for her every year), but do go on, tell me about how it's the most wonderful time of the year...", "There was nothing on her actual birthday though. Does she need 2 days to celebrate?", "Grown ups regularly \u201cobsess\u201d over milestone birthdays. 30th certainly qualifies.", "But they aren\u2019t getting married on her birthday so I\u2019m not understanding the freaking issue", "I am not American. I'm from Britain and no birthday would compete with  someone's wedding here. I think here it's something that children celebrate seriously, whereas adults often pass them with no big fuss at all.", "Which countries?", "I love your humor here OP \ud83d\ude02", "Thanks for the info!  That's super interesting.  Where I live, the legal bit is really just a signing of a document that is done after the ceremony (which is just for show) and mailed into the proper government office.  \n\nI think NTA here.  30th is a fun birthday milestone and they completely sucked the wind out of it.  If you were a more peripheral guest, not a big deal, but since it's your brother I would think he'd be more thoughtful and try for any other summer weekend.", "Oh ok.", "They explicitly considered it by choosing to not schedule on the day of though which is honestly more than a lot of people would do. I'm not understanding this oddly entitled expectation that they reach out to confirm they're allowed to schedule their wedding on not your birthday.", "Rehearsal for a wedding has always seemed just a waste of money to me. Honestly cannot understand why you need it at all. \n\nNTA op.", "Crazy that you\u2019ve been to a wedding in every country like that", "Do adults still celebrate their birthdays with their siblings on a regular basis?", "It's a birthday and the old gal is in her 30s... time to realize life does not revolve around her. Birthday parties are for kids.", "They've booked her parents' back garden  & a pub.... what restrictions lmao", "Some people like to celebrate with loved ones and that's okay. It seems like OP knows there could be an issue with this and is upset because then her brother wont be able to celebrate with her.", "That's honestly a big understatement.\n\nIt's just your birthday is essentially saying it doesn't matter and that OP is invalid for wanting their 30th on the 27th. As far as the comments go, 30th bdays are actually pretty big things for a lot of people.\n\nPersonally, I can definitely see what OP is feeling because my birthday has always been \"just my birthday\" and no grounds to be upset when I understood that my mom was working and just felt rather lonely on the actual day. Being important and thought of on your birthday is the big thing here. OP just wishes brother would've thought of them a bit more when it came to planning the wedding which is understandable, at least from my immature 18 yo perspective.", "Well I can maybe understand that for a kid or teenager living at home, but at 29, an age where most of us have moved out? \n\nI would not bother my mom and siblings/family on a weekday after a long day at work to come see me, only to have them come on a weekend to properly celebrate again lol\n\nI do get that 30 is special, but you can have a huge celebration the week before or after is all.

They\u2019re not comparable, my dude.", "Sure, can be seen this way... Or, the needs of multiple people (groom, bride, all of the families) outweigh those of one relative.", "If OP would have liked a family event or even a close family event then everyone will be sleeping off the big wedding. Where\u2019s the energy to celebrate the next day? The big 3-0 is now in the shadow of the big wedding.\n\nIt\u2019s not a huge deal but it\u2019s enough of a shadow to take the joy of the occasion away a little. It seems something that could have been addressed at planning stage. After all, these are siblings who grew up knowing each other\u2019s birthdays, not recently made friends or distant cousins.", "she\u2019s allowed to want to celebrate her birthday without wanting anything to overshadow her day. y\u2019all act like it\u2019s a damn crime for her to want to be celebrated on the only day acceptable to do so", "Whoops. I meant to post this as a reply to someone on my first comment. Ignore.", "[removed]", "Well our wedding party got confused and swapped sides at the rehearsal\u2026 so I\u2019d say it was definitely worth practicing. Plus it kind of helped me prepare mentally being the center of attention in a big crowd.  The rehearsal itself doesn\u2019t cost anything, but we did a large, casual dinner with our wedding party, close friends, family and anyone that traveled far. We did trivia, and It was a nice ice breaker for family on both sides that hadn\u2019t met so that the day of the wedding people were more relaxed and could enjoy themselves fully. I get that may not me for everyone, but the actual wedding flew by for husband and I so it was really nice spending time with family the day before.", "Peace of mind really. The actual wedding day is often very busy and the couple likely doesn't want to be worrying about details like \"does the wedding party know the order to enter in?\".
