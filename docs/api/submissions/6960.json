So, birthday's graduations, etc. were talked about because we didn't want anybody *we wanted there* to have to choose between our wedding and another major event even if they would surely pick ours. Days adjacent to our siblings birthdays were obviously out of the question.\n\nI'm honestly curious as to the reasoning behind picking that date. Whether people think its a \"big deal\" or not, the brother should know that a 30th birthday is of above average importance compared to most others. His sister would want to do ***something***.
