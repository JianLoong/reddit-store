{"id": 27281, "submission_id": "16nstl1", "title": "AITA for not wanting school pickup to be a family event?", "selftext": "My wife is a stay at home mom and I work from home. My wife doesn\u2019t drive so I pick up my oldest from school daily and bring them back home. We also have 2 kids too young for school.\n\nWhen my oldest started, my wife and other 2 kids came along for drop off and pick up. After a few days, I said that everyone coming along for a school pickup drive is too overwhelming for me in the middle of the day of work and completely throws me off as I get out of my work mind state and go back into parenting/husband mode. For example, when I go alone, I stay in the work mindset and think to myself about what I was working on and can get back on track faster and also get to relax and listen to my own music. Most of the time I go alone I also bring my work computer and work while waiting. I absolutely cannot do this when other people are in the car as it is entirely too distracting.\n\nWhile I understand my wife\u2019s PoV that she wants to be there too for our oldest and it is a fun thing to do, we got into a huge argument when I said we cannot be doing this every day for the above reasons. Her parents are in town now from Mexico and she also want to come along too for a couple of times. I\u2019m rightfully fucking annoyed at this point as now it is even more time away and more corralling and getting everyone ready. I\u2019m currently biting my tongue as I don\u2019t want to say anything in front of her parents to make them feel bad.\n\nIMO my ability to get away from work to quickly pick up and bring my oldest home is a luxury and priority should be getting them home safely and as quick as possible so that I can get back to work and finish at a decent time. She does not understand this and is more focused on the experience for her and now her parents. I am currently sitting here typing this annoyed as fuck bringing 4 additional people on a car ride that honestly are not required to be present for the task. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: She has her license after I convinced her this summer but she does not feel comfortable or confident enough driving with the kids in the car yet, which IMO is completely reasonable and likely a smart choice.\n\nAs for those saying I need to be in dad mode, I am once my kid is in the car and that is my 15 minute break. I ask them how their day was, what they did today, what they learned, etc on the drive home. However, the issue is the additional 20-ish minutes of waiting before then and during the drive.\n\nAs for the bus, my wife had some extremely fucked up experiences on the bus growing up, which is why we go this route. I fully support the no bus route with how terrible kids are with near zero supervision.", "created_utc": 1695234945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nstl1/aita_for_not_wanting_school_pickup_to_be_a_family/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, you do need to focus on work during the work day.  It's not practical to have a big family trip every day.\n\nBut there is a very obvious solution here.  Why can't your wife learn to drive so she can do the pick-up?  Or why can't she walk/bike/take the bus to do the pick-up?  Another option is to car-pool with another family.  \n\nShe is a stay-at-home parent, so this is exactly the kind of thing she should be doing while you're working.  You need to focus on solving the problem by getting her to be more independent.  Support her in getting her license.", "NTA\n\nIf your wife wants to be there to pick up your oldest son, or take her parents with them for the pick up, why doesn't she get a license to drive? I find it odd that you have to leave work everyday in the middle of your shift to pick up your son at all. Are buses not available? Regardless, your wife needs to get a license if she wants to do all this and not just dump it all on you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she just wants to get out of the house. \n\nShe can\u2019t drive, so presumably needs you to take her places, and if you don\u2019t drive somewhere that day she just is stuck at home all day?", "NTA\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me. Why bring the other kids if they don't need to go? Leaving the house getting 3 kids ready is a lot harder than just taking the one who actually needs to get to school. Sounds like a circus. Dropping off and picking up kids from school is not that fun of an activity that it needs extra participation, also when I would drop off/pick up one of my kids we would have a little alone time while driving which I thought was nice. I am curious, why does your wife not drive?", "NTA.  It's way past time for your wife to learn how to drive. Buy her some driving lessons.", "NTA. And if she wants the \"school pickup experience\" then tell her to get a driver's license.", "info - why does your wife not drive?", "INFO: why isn\u2019t she driving? Are her parents driving and wouldn\u2019t they be able to do the pickup while they are here.\n\nTo be honest, I understand perfectly your point of view and you are being very patient to avoid tension while you in laws.\nI will go with NAH but obviously you need to find a solution and your needs should be taken into account.\n\nThere is no simple solution apart from someone else doing the pickup.\nDo you think she would accept to limit to 2 or 3 times a week?", "Tell your wife to learn to drive NTA", "Nta, it would drive me insane too that a quick pickup turns in to a family outing. I'd suggest wife learns how to drive if there's no medical reason.", "NTA that all sounds absolutely exhausting", "NTA. They're turning a task into a chore. If your wife wants to be there for picking up the kid then she needs to learn how to drive and handle it.   \n\n\nThe fact that you're still on the clock while you\\\\'re doing the pickups only furthers this.", "INFO: does she not drive or not have a license? What's the reason for either?", "NTA. You summarized it perfectly that it IS a luxury you are able to leave in the middle of work to shuttle your oldest. Is there a school bus? Is there a reason your wife can't learn ro drive?", "Light YTA\n\nThe grandparents want to be involved, take a breath and calm yourself down before YOU cause the event\n\nAgreed that you should talk to her privately later about lessening the time of having to drag everyone there all the time. But it does sound like she's just a bit stir crazy and wanting to get out of the house too", "Her family are visiting, they want to come \"a couple of times\", so yes, YTA. You make concessions for visitors. And not being allowed to remain in work mode isn't a good enough reason to be a bad host. It's not good enough for being a bad father, either. Your child could probably use you being in dad mode.", "ESH.  You are TA for marrying someone who can't drive and doesn't want to if you're unwilling to shoulder the responsibility for driving everyone around. You knew what you were getting into when you married and had children with your wife. She is TA for forcing you to drive home from work before picking up your kids. She can be there for your oldest when he walks in the door.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't be in \"work mode\" anyway but in parent mode for your child because they might want to tell you about their day or any problems they have.\n\nMake this your regular break time and you don't need to get annoyed because you can't use it for work.\n\nPlus: The grandparents are just visiting and taking them along for a couple of days is not that much of a hassle - they just want to be involved in their grandchild's life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good luck!", "NTA getting everyone in the car takes longer, it's also a good bit of one on one time with the eldest. And it uses more energy and fuel when everyone is in the csst do wasted fuel and not economic.", "NTA\n\nWhy does your wife not drive? Unless there is a medical reason that she is not able to drive, then it sounds like she needs to learn to drive and get her license so that she can start handling drop off and pickup on her own. I absolutely agree with you that this should not be something that derails your workday, and I think it sounds like others are misunderstanding that this isn't just an issue for the short time her parents are here... she wants the whole family to come every day even when they are not. Also, if your wife is not able to learn how to drive, can your oldest child ride the bus and could your wife then walk to meet her at the bus stop with the other two?", "Wife is TA. You can\u2019t not do it because she doesn\u2019t want to drive. You can\u2019t not do it because wife had negative experiences on the bus. \n\nThere seems to be no compromise where your needs or wants are even remotely entertained.", "NTA - There is absolutely no reason for your wife to drag the entire household and co along for a 15 minute drive.\n\nShe wants to do this? She can get her license and start driving.", "NTA. \n\nI think if it was all of them coming along JUST when her parents were in town, I would tell you to suck it up, as we all change our schedule and was is easiest for us for visitors. That would be just a few days out of the year that you would have to get everyone in the car, which makes sense. \n\nBut I totally get where this doesn't work every day. A compromise could be once a week everyone comes, but I couldn't handle this every day either.", "NTA you are luckily working from home and able to quickly help out with is great that you can do this to support your wife who isn't ready to drive or able to catch the bus. Perhaps suggest that they come with you once a week and not daily as this is your work time and makes your work day longer", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is living a life of weaponized helplessness. She is a stay at home parent, with a driver's license, and she should be picking up your child from school.\n\nHer being uncomfortable isn't an excuse. The only way to get comfortable with driving is by doing it.\n\nShe needs to pull it together, and she needs to pull her weight in this relationship. \n\nYou have a stay at home partner, but you still have to be present anytime anyone in the household needs to go somewhere. This includes taking the kids to school, doctor's appointments, grocery runs, shopping... basically everything....", "NTA - i don\u2019t blame you at all. It adds a lot of fanfare and stress. You\u2019ve got extra people to get dressed, shoes on, strapped in the car\u2026 it\u2019s noisy..: more people to keep safe crossing the street\u2026 I\u2019d be annoyed too.", "NTA.  This gives your oldest a few minutes of alone quality time with you which is fantastic.", "I mean, he should be able to have one interaction with his older kids without his wife there.  I'm sure as a Stay at home mom she has SO many special interactions with them and can be there for so many special moments.  Let dad have one thing that is just him and the older kid.  Heck, the older kid would probably prefer having some special attention just on them without a car full of people.  It seems like mom can't let go of the kids even a tiny bit to let dad have his own moments.", "Replied to the wrong comment, so deleted the original reply...\n\nYes, he should have time with his kids alone.  However, it's the middle of the work day and it sounds like it's not practical for him to leave work.  So I think they should prioritize getting the wife to a place where she can be responsible for the pick-ups.\n\nBut yes, I do agree that in the meantime, he should explain to the wife that he'd like to use the time to hang out with his kid."]}
