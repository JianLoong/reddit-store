My wife doesn\u2019t drive so I pick up my oldest from school daily and bring them back home. We also have 2 kids too young for school.\n\nWhen my oldest started, my wife and other 2 kids came along for drop off and pick up. After a few days, I said that everyone coming along for a school pickup drive is too overwhelming for me in the middle of the day of work and completely throws me off as I get out of my work mind state and go back into parenting/husband mode. For example, when I go alone, I stay in the work mindset and think to myself about what I was working on and can get back on track faster and also get to relax and listen to my own music. Most of the time I go alone I also bring my work computer and work while waiting. I absolutely cannot do this when other people are in the car as it is entirely too distracting.\n\nWhile I understand my wife\u2019s PoV that she wants to be there too for our oldest and it is a fun thing to do, we got into a huge argument when I said we cannot be doing this every day for the above reasons. Her parents are in town now from Mexico and she also want to come along too for a couple of times. I\u2019m rightfully fucking annoyed at this point as now it is even more time away and more corralling and getting everyone ready. I\u2019m currently biting my tongue as I don\u2019t want to say anything in front of her parents to make them feel bad.\n\nIMO my ability to get away from work to quickly pick up and bring my oldest home is a luxury and priority should be getting them home safely and as quick as possible so that I can get back to work and finish at a decent time. She does not understand this and is more focused on the experience for her and now her parents. I am currently sitting here typing this annoyed as fuck bringing 4 additional people on a car ride that honestly are not required to be present for the task. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: She has her license after I convinced her this summer but she does not feel comfortable or confident enough driving with the kids in the car yet, which IMO is completely reasonable and likely a smart choice.\n\nAs for those saying I need to be in dad mode, I am once my kid is in the car and that is my 15 minute break. I ask them how their day was, what they did today, what they learned, etc on the drive home. However, the issue is the additional 20-ish minutes of waiting before then and during the drive.\n\nAs for the bus, my wife had some extremely fucked up experiences on the bus growing up, which is why we go this route. I fully support the no bus route with how terrible kids are with near zero supervision.", "created_utc": 1695234945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nstl1/aita_for_not_wanting_school_pickup_to_be_a_family/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Another option is to car-pool with another family.  \n\nShe is a stay-at-home parent, so this is exactly the kind of thing she should be doing while you're working.

A little bit of alone time on the way to this daily errand is definitely not a big ask. It's not like you're keeping the kid from her--you're literally driving them home.\n\nThat said, if she absolutely needs to come, and she recently got a license, maybe let her drive with you in the passenger seat so she can get more comfortable driving.

Practice with your wife at a time when school is out, going to the school and back so she knows the route, stop lights etc like the back of her hand and there are no surprises.

It can be a very anxiety riddled thing and if someone isn't comfortable driving, they definitely shouldn't be driving with young kids, so kudos to you for recognizing that in your edit. Your wife needs to understand that this is a task for you and since you are executing it, she should respect your boundaries for it. You respected her boundaries about not driving, she needs to return the favor and respect yours for wanting pick up to be just a simple thing.  \n\n\nAlso, has your wife considered trying an ebike to pick up the kid from school? I've seen a lot of people fit their kids on bikes and it might be a nice alternative for her.", "NTA I also work from home and pick up my daughter from school. I can't use that time to run other errands because it definitely pulls you out of the work mindset. Sitting in the pickup line can be a great time to catch up emails, read reports, etc. but having a car full of passengers makes that impossible.

Maybe a compromise and every Friday the whole family piles in the car for pickup.", "Stop telling her you are going, just leave and get your oldest.

He then adds an edit to say he does actually go into dad mode when his kid is in the car, and that he does a little work when waiting. But that is all new information he didn't say before (until we questioned it), which is what made it seem like he was being unreasonable in regards to his in-laws and, more importantly, to his eldest child. \n\nEven with the edits... Suggesting that switching off work mode twice for in-laws visiting from another country isn't treating WFH as a weekend. It's understanding that on occasions you have to make a little extra effort. What he is losing is the 5 minutes he would be on his laptop in the car after the drive there. He is allowed to do that work later, as OP says that he doesn't want to drive them all, so he can finish work earlier. Adding that time to the end of the day, to accommodate family from abroad, and give something nice to the whole family, that's not a huge ask.

If he alone goes to his child's school to pick him up. He would only mind himself and can switch to dad mode after his son gets in the car. If everyone comes along picking up the kid, the time before getting in the car (getting everyone be ready, small talk with everyone involved, possible other distractions like music choice etc) and time after getting off (small talk, possible getting take outs, etc) removes him into work mode for more than an hour rhus taling away alot of his \"work\" time because it would take longer than that for him to return into flow state and that is a HUGE ask.

Maybe Friday could be a family pick-up day but certainly not every day. \n\nI also think once a week your wife should do the driving without the other 2 kids who can stay with you.  I know that disrupts your workflow mindset but the goal should be to get your wife comfortable driving so she needs to start somewhere. When she gets more comfortable, she can bring the other kids with her and leave you at home to work.", "My mom was a SAHM and, once we lived far enough away from school to qualify for a bus route, my parents had no shame putting me on the bus.  They would literally chase down the bus at the next stop they could to ensure they didn't drive me to school (which wasn't much farther than where they would \"meet the bus\").  Just put the kid on the bus so they can waste another hour each way of their life learning how to socialize.  What's the worst that could happen?  Some colorful new language and lower emissions alongside no interruption at work for you, OP.  \n\nMaybe put the kid on the bus til the wife decides to put her license to use and pick up that kid.  Seems like that could be a useful threat to get her to actually drive and get comfortable with it.", "I hate doing a drop off and pick up all together but I def don\u2019t want a clown car of people doing it with me. Sounds annoying.", "NTA but your wife sounds like a child. This whole she has her license but not the confidence thing is sounding like a whole excuse.", "NTA but your wife not feeling \"comfortable or confident enough driving with the kids in the car\" is absolutely NOT a \"reasonable and ... smart choice\".  She needs to be able to get them to a hospital in an emergency.  You both need to step up your efforts to get her there.", "NTA. Your wife really needs to step up her driving.  Don\u2019t let her be like my aunt Mary who used her learned helplessness with driving to enslave first her husband and then her kids as they became old enough to chauffeur her around.", "NTA! I would be absolutely the same! When I'm in work mode I'm not in the mood for any experiences! I need to be switched on. Your wife seems a bit unreasonable IMO. She needs to start getting comfortable to starting driving the kids. Until she does, it's your call how pick ups go. And there has to be a little consideration for the person who is working because u have third party people to answer to, bosses, collegues, clients, whatever. Anyway, hold off until in laws are gone", "What your wife is doing with the no driving is called weaponized incompetence. She needs the practice and she needs to start. She\u2019s complacent with learning how to do it because it\u2019s the easier option. \n\nNTA when it comes to the actual question", "NTA.  Just tell them we'll all go for a ride after I get off work, this is unnecessary.", "NTA. I come home straight from work and take my kid to school, then sleep, then pick her up from school. That time in my car alone is nice because I can just relax and think. Having everyone tag along makes it take longer getting everyone in the car, etc. and would be annoying as hell. It's stressful to have to be \"on\" all the time. On for work, on for family at pick up time, on after work. Jeez.", "NTA\n\nThis is not fun time. This is a short routine break from your workday.\n\nHer parents can drive now that they are in town. When they leave, it's just you again. \n\nStop the nonsense. There is a time and a place for everything and this is not family outing time.", "It's going to make things worse for you, but how about if she comes along she has to drive with you in the passenger seat. To get her experience up.", "Yea, YTA. No reason for your wife and younger kids to not get out of the house for 30-40 minutes to do pick up as well. It\u2019s a nice way to break up the day. Either get up earlier and start working earlier or work later in order to make it work for the family. It cruel to be honest, to not let your wife leave the house. Until she feels comfortable with her diving skills, this is your life. Suck it up.", "How big is your car to fit all these people in and your kids.?", "Your wife Ned\u2019s to stop being selfish and just think of herself.\n\nYou\u2019re still supposed to be working and not out and about so it makes sense for you to be in work mode and working while waiting for your son.\n\nWFH doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off. It means you\u2019re working but from a different location.\n\nMaybe say that only Friday you\u2019ll do a family school pick-up.\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t have to like it, but there\u2019s only 1 pay check coming from you so you need to put your work before fun family pick-up times on your work time. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult and needs to understand that you can\u2019t always have what you want. You need to take responsibility for what is needed for your family to have shelter/food/\u2026\u2026", "NTA but your wife needs to start driving. What if something happened to you? How would she take care of the kids? That\u2019s ridiculous. You shouldn\u2019t have to interrupt your work day for her incompetence.", "NTA your wife needs to accept school pick up is your bonding time with your eldest child, not a family event. Alternatively, she needs to get a car and start picking up the kid herself.", "That would drive me nuts. I'd be saying it's not a family outing, either you go or I do but not both", "NTA if picking the kid up from school was so important to her then she should have gotten her drivers license a long time ago so she could do it herself. That was a choice she made. As the driver you get to make the rules and if it is everyone else stays home then that\u2019s what goes.", "Nta. I completely understand your pov. You need to set boundaries", "NTA. If the school offers after school care included or at a reasonable price, maybe a compromise would be it can done as a family event if you are already finished with work? If you are home, would your wife be comfortable driving just to pick up your eldest if the two younger children are with you at home while you have your break?\n\nBut I completely agree, as a daily thing it\u2019s completely unnecessary.", "\nTRs4r44e44", "NTA. This is a ridiculous expectation for your wife to have. Also, she needs to practice driving to get more comfortable with it.", "This. I don't drive (I've got my learners and I'm trying to get behind the wheel but anxiety gets the better of me), but I walk my eldest to kindy and will be walking them to school when they start next year. Anything outside walking distance, assuming I don't have family willing to give me a lift, is done with public transport. We've only got one car anyway, and my husband needs it to get to work.", "Oh wow, you\u2019re probably right. I just got really claustrophobic imagining that.", "Someone suggested making it a Friday activity, as a family pick-up + dinner out or something. If something like that can be done without affecting the work day (if dad's work-from-home job can cut out early on Friday or something) that would be pretty nice. Of course it depends on the job.", "This is a very reasonable solution!", "I have no depth perception and cars coming toward me look like they aren't moving. I did try to learn but found I couldn't compensate.  No law against me driving but I decided the responsible thing was not to drive. I live in an urban area to ensure that I can get ariound.", "As they get older Costco shopping cart rides are an excellent way to kill some awake time.", "So, you\u2019ve never worked from home or done knowledge work, huh? \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely a measurable impact when someone needs to switch in and out of \u201cwork mode\u201d. \n\nI can\u2019t think of anything more distracting or unnecessary than turning a straightforward 20-minute school pickup into a family road trip, including the in-laws!", "That's all well and good. But if the SAHM wife wants to instill that type of family culture, then she needs to do the pick up. Her husband is *away* at the office", "Eh there's a lot of arguments to be made that cars are really bad for society so I think there's a decent argument for taking a stance against driving.\n\nOffloading the consequences of that decision into other people, OTOH, does make someone an AH.", "This can be true for sure", "Exactly. Being in a car alone allows OP to think about the email he's going to write, his next task, or a problem that he has to solve. Being in a car with 2 children under 5 yo + a wife + in laws DOES NOT allow for that. Instead of thinking about an email, he is making small talk with his in-laws and telling the young kids to stop kicking each other. \n\nPlus, imagine when he gets home. His kids probably think he's in \"dad mode\" and able to play with them. So now he has to tell all three kids to stop bothering him, instead of being able to quietly exit, pick up the oldest, and quietly return to his home office.", ">He would only mind himself and can switch to dad mode after his son gets in the car.\n\nMy main issue was not switching to dad mode. OP added an edit to say that they did this. But originally worded in a way that said they did not want to switch off from work mode at all. \n\nI didn't suggest that they should all go together every day... anywhere. I said he should make the effort for the \"couple of days\" his in-laws are in town from another country. Asking for his flow to b interrupted for 2 days is not a HUGE ask. It's fairly minor.", "And yet OP now says they do switch out of work mode every day... So how does your argument work? He either doesn't switch out of work mode and is failing at dad mode when it's required. Or he can switch out of it, because he is being a decent parent. It can't be both.\n\nDoing a 20 minute drive with the whole family would be distracting, obviously. But it's two times!!!! You're all being hugely dramatic about 2 days where he works an extra 20 minutes at the end of the day!", "I work from home. I typically take 1 short break, and a fast lunch break \u2014 both off the clock. \n\nIt is impossible to \u201cput away\u201d work for my breaks. I\u2019m going back to it. My mind is mulling over problem-solving or playing scenarios on how I would have solved a problem differently. Consider this the \u201cdriving time\u201d the OP mentioned. \n\nIf my husband is able to take his break at the same time, we might have a quick \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d phone call or text. Consider this the \u201cafter pickup\u201d time of the drive. \n\nFor you to say OP \u201cisn\u2019t actually working\u201d while driving is completely incorrect. The mental work OP does while driving is quite possibly the most productive part of the day. \n\nJust because your work is not such that a drive or break is also productive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true for everyone.", "Cool. So you believe he works during his drive,  because it's true for you. And maybe it's true for him. He describes it as relaxing and listening to his own music, so it didn't seem do be a hugely important problem solving time. But, even if it is, there is still time to do this elsewhere in the day.. for the 2 days his in-laws want to come to school pick-up. Even if he has to add an hour on to his work day to get back his 20 minutes of mental work, then it's not a huge ask. It's 2 days. How much does everyone in this sub hate their family to not be able to put a bit of extra effort in for 2 days?!"]}
