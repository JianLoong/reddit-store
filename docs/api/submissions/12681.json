I do not have an ongoing relationship with my stepsister. We weren't close when my dad married her mom and her mom was my dad's affair partner and she was the kid who thought it was great so my brother and I didn't really like her for that. She thought we were brats who couldn't accept that her mom was better than ours and that's why the affair wasn't a bad thing. We ended up choosing as older teenagers to not see our dad anymore. He kept trying to keep us in his life. But he broke our mom's heart and he broke our trust. Plus he gave us no time to accept our parents breaking up. He left our family home and moved in with his affair partner and married her tree days after the divorce from mom was finalized and he was pushing his stepdaughter as our \"sister\".\n\nWe did stay in touch with our dad's siblings. They have stayed in touch with dad and his new family. About a week ago they gave my stepsister my contact info and she asked if I would be able to help her out with babysitting since she heard I do it for my brother. I said no. She tried to pull the family card and I told her we were never family and to ask her parents for help, or the people who gave her my contact info. Then I told my aunt's and uncle's whoever give her my info was wrong. My aunt who gave it to her said it wouldn't have killed me to get to know my niece and to help my stepsister when I do it for my brother all the time. I told her the difference is he's my brother and his kids are my nieces and nephew's and my stepsister and her kid are not those things.\n\nStepsister tried to call again and when I didn't answer she sent me a text saying I was an asshole and she's in need and she knows I do it. I blocked her.

She should have had an abortion if she can't handle a her kid.", "Your stepsister is innocent in the decisions your father made.  If you take him out of the equation do you think you could help her?  I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy for her to take the step to ask for help.  A mother looking to find someone they trust to take care of their child is such a hard place to be.  Try to not take what your father did out on anyone else.  Be the better person.  Open your heart to a baby and she is family by association.  Think 5 years down the road will she call you aunt?", "NTA. Block the step and tell the aunt she can babysit for the step. \n\nIf the aunt continues to be a PITA about it block her too.", "NTA\n\nWhenever I see that old \"but faaaaaamily!!\" line, my immediate thoughts go to Peggy from Eastenders screeching that! (UK soap opera reference!)", "NTA\n\nJust block her", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNobody is required to provide childcare except the parents.", "NTA. It\u2019s honestly super alarming that she would be willing to give her kids to a virtual stranger.", "Nta i do this to all my stepsisters and don\u2019t care", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Your is 100% TA for giving your contact info out without permission and trying to volunteer you for anything. Your dad's siblings also should not be sharing information about your life with people you are estranged from. Step sister is honestly just your dad's wife's daughter and nothing to you. \n\nHow much free time these people think you have? You're watching your brother's three kids that are four and under. That's all the personal favors anyone probably has time for. This other person really thinks you're also going to run to watch a seven month old?", "NTA.  Stepsister is a living symbol of your dad's betrayal and demolishing of your family.  You don't owe her a damn thing, and you never will.", "NTA. Your dad, stepsister, and aunt are all the assholes. You\u2019re not obligated to babysit for your stepsister. The aunt who gave her your number should be the very one babysitting for her and not you. I hate relatives who gaslight and try to guilt trip you.", "You owe her nothing, you\u2019ve made it clear you\u2019re not family, or don\u2019t see her as such. NTA", "NTA marriage, sharing a home, and/or sharing DNA doesn't obligate you to other people. You don't have much choice while you're a minor to decide who gets to claim you as family, but as an adult, you absolutely get to choose who you claim as family and what type of relationship you want to have with them. The only children you have an obligation to are your own.", "NTA. \n\nAt least your dad waited 3 whole days. My ex waited 1 day before marrying the other woman (who was also already pregnant and 20 years younger than him). \n\nI\u2019m thankful that my children were too young to understand everything at the time and love their brothers. But their dad managed to screw that one up too and is on wife #3 and expecting kid #6 at this point. \n\nMy children haven\u2019t seen their father in a couple of years and haven\u2019t even met the newest wife or kid (soon to be kids). And when asked how many siblings they have, they don\u2019t even count them. \n\nMy point of this long winded story is to say you\u2019re NTA. Not even a little. The real AHs here are your dad and his wife.", "Nta and lose the aunt who did this", "Block her.\n\nWrite a mail to your family that you will block everyone who hassels you about your desicion. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There\u2019s a phrase my sister used to step sibling once.  \u201cJust because my dad has s@x with your mother, doesn\u2019t mean I have to like you!\u201d  It summed up things perfectly, for me.", "NTA\n\n\nYour aunt clearly offered her babysitting services, though.", "NTA", "Karma is a bad bitch \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02nta", "She can ask her \u2018better than your mom\u2019 to babysit.

His children are also your nieces and nephews by birth. She is not your sister by birth, but by an affair that broke up your family. It is her kid, not yours. You don't consider her your sister due to all the bullying and badmouthing of your mother when you were young.  She wouldn't be contacting you now if she didn't want something from you. Auntie can take her pick of reasons and take care of the child herself if she feels someone needs to help out.", "NTA, you are not obligated to watch anyone\u2019s kid except your own.", "Not your circus,  I'm changing monkeys to asses.", "NTA - tell her to let her slutty mother babysit since she thinks she's so great.", "NTA. Apples and Oranges. Even if she were your full blood sister & you had a great relationship, you can still say No to babysitting - regardless of whether or not you baby sit for anyone else. It's still apples and oranges.", "Why can\u2019t her own mom babysit, after all, her mom is better anyways? NTA OP", "Yeah no OP they can all go jump into a lake of fire as my mom used to say. U dont owe anyone ur time or free babysitting God. I'm a teacher and i know kids are exhausting. You don't even have a close relationship with her so anyone that has an issue with it can go help her out themselves if she needs help that badly. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to your time just because her mom married your dad, especially after behaving so unkindly to you and your brother. She FAFOed.", "But you especially dont owe it to someone with an attitude as you described in your post \n\nShe apparently doesnt understand words have impact and consequences.\n\n\"We weren't close when my dad married her mom and her mom was my dad's affair partner and she was the kid who thought it was great so my brother and I didn't really like her for that. She thought we were brats who couldn't accept that her mom was better than ours and that's why the affair wasn't a bad thing.\"", "Exactly just tell her that her mom is probably a better Choice than you - after all you take after your mom", "*step-sister", "This.\n\nOP, respond to her text with this:\n\n\"Name, while our parents might be married, I have never chosen to have a relationship with you particularly because of your attitude like this. You reek of entitlement. You are not enetitled to my time. I suggest you find someone who wants a relationship with you and your child to babysit because I do not want to. I do not \"owe\" you babysitting and we are not siblings. Good luck to you.\"\n\nSend, then block.", "NTA. It\u2019s disgusting how she thought that her mom was better than yours. She can ask your dad to babysit.", "Agreed. She contacted OP after years and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \"can you do me a solid?\". I'd be pissed too.", "Thanks! Skim reading is not my forte apparently!", "Yeah I realise I misread and it is step sister. \n\neither way, NTA.", "You were in before my edit \ud83d\ude05", "Absolutely.", "I mean, depending on how old she was and what her mom and OP's dad told her, I wouldn't blame her for being so callous if/when she was a little kid. There's a good chance they told her something douchey to make the affair sound good, like \"your new daddy is coming to live with us because his old wife was bad and your mommy is so good and makes him happy,\" which is a horrific thing to put in a kid's mind but is 100% on the adults. It's not her fault for believing the authority figures in her tiny life at that point, and then by extension she would naturally believe that if Other Mommy is Bad, and My Mommy is Good, then surely my two new brothers are going to be much happier here! Why are they so upset? They're with Good Mommy now!\n\nBut she's an adult now and she should understand exactly how awful her kid words are now that she's old enough to understand what she was saying to them. If she wants a relationship with those same stepbrothers as an adult, it has to start with acknowledging how much she hurt them, even though she probably didn't realize that's what she was doing. You can't just sweep it under the rug and act like it doesn't matter anymore.", "Aunt is probably from OP\u2019s father\u2019s side - aka, sister to the dad - so she is likely excusing his affair and remarriage in 3 days to begin with."]}
