I do not have an ongoing relationship with my stepsister. We weren't close when my dad married her mom and her mom was my dad's affair partner and she was the kid who thought it was great so my brother and I didn't really like her for that. She thought we were brats who couldn't accept that her mom was better than ours and that's why the affair wasn't a bad thing. We ended up choosing as older teenagers to not see our dad anymore. He kept trying to keep us in his life. But he broke our mom's heart and he broke our trust. Plus he gave us no time to accept our parents breaking up. He left our family home and moved in with his affair partner and married her tree days after the divorce from mom was finalized and he was pushing his stepdaughter as our \"sister\".\n\nWe did stay in touch with our dad's siblings. They have stayed in touch with dad and his new family. About a week ago they gave my stepsister my contact info and she asked if I would be able to help her out with babysitting since she heard I do it for my brother. I said no. She tried to pull the family card and I told her we were never family and to ask her parents for help, or the people who gave her my contact info. Then I told my aunt's and uncle's whoever give her my info was wrong. My aunt who gave it to her said it wouldn't have killed me to get to know my niece and to help my stepsister when I do it for my brother all the time. I told her the difference is he's my brother and his kids are my nieces and nephew's and my stepsister and her kid are not those things.\n\nStepsister tried to call again and when I didn't answer she sent me a text saying I was an asshole and she's in need and she knows I do it. I blocked her.

And trying to force a relationship on you. Good job on having a backbone and boundaries", "NTA! Your stepsister is so entitled!", "NTA. Funny how these sorts of people never initiate contact because they want to give something to YOU...or even just get to know you again. It's always always ALWAYS because they want something.", "As \"a teacher\" does it bother you when people spell words wrong?\n\nIn the words of Weird Al:  B. C. R. U. are words not letters, get it together.\n\nEta: NTA OP.", "OP also doesn\u2019t mention her dad at all. I have to wonder if he was out of the picture and she was thrilled to have a nuclear family again.", "Why is the sub so full of entitled parents??  \nWe had some parental help when we had our kids, but it was mostly volunteered because they wanted to spend time with the grandkids.  \nWe never *expected* babysitting.  \nIf you can't deal with kids, don't have kids.  \nNTA", "Lol. NTA!", "NTA\n\nHer kids are her responsibility.   Period.  End of sentence.  \n\nI'm all in favor of helping those you like and enjoy being around.  Calling you an AH doesn't make her likeable at all.  Why should you do her a favor when she can't even be nice?", "NTA. She decided to be a parent, you didn\u2019t.", "NTA. \n\nYou need to make it clear to your aunt why your stepsister isn't family to you, so she stops pushing contact. You don't have a sibling bond with her and never have, and that your relationship with her is defined by how she glorified a traumatic, trust-breaking event for you, celebrating your father's affair and thinking her mom was 'better' than yours. She ruined it before you could have even a friendship. How could she possibly be your family emotionally? How could that child possibly be your niece if that woman never tried to be your sister?\n\nEven if she was a nice enough girl and hadn't acted like that, it'd still be difficult to want to spend time with someone who helps represent such a terrible event to you. Doesn't your aunt and uncle respect that you NC with your dad?\n\nYou aren't obligated to do her any favors just because your dad married her mom, and from the way it sounds like she's gloated in the past, it doesn't seem like you have any reason to want to be even friends with her now. Pulling the 'family' card like that is dirty, low, and laughable.\n\nAlso, even if you were blood siblings, you haven't been in contact with her until she needed something from you. Then she calls you TA because you won't do it? Um.", "Unreal. Nta. I would even block that aunt after telling her to babysit the baby herself.", "NTA. A recurring theme in this sub is people being nasty to people then shamelessly asking them for help when they have an issue.", "NTA and if anyone ever gave out my contact information without my permission I'd make their life hell for it. It's a complete violation of privacy.", "NTA. And what the hell is wrong with your aunt?", "Also, I\u2019m just amazed at the balls on this step sister. Contacts OP out of the blue after years of no contact\u2014heck, has to weasel her phone number off someone else\u2014and INSTANTLY asks for babysitting help. That is a special level of clueless and entitled.", "Why can\u2019t stepsis\u2019s mother help her?", "NTA   And your mom is infinitely better than a homewrecker who didn't give a shit about anything except herself.  My dad did the same, I refuse to have a relationship with his AP or their kids.", "Great Job!", "NTA. Who are these people ???", "it wouldnt kill your aunt to shut the fuck up either. NTA", "NTA  You\u2019re not related to her, aren\u2019t friends, and her need is not your problem.", "NTA. Why can't the aunt babysit?", "Nta. You don't owe her anything and she sounds like an entitled brat.", "NTA she isnt your niece. You are being used. Your aunt can look after the kid since she is so invested.  So can her adulterous parents.", "Maybe it's time to cut that aunt out of your life too.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why isn't the Aunt babysitting?", "And they 100% won't send back my toddler caffeinatedwith a brand new puppy (if kid was older) /s", "The dad made the vow  so it is his fault.  But a woman and mother doing that to another woman and mother is horrifying.  Its fair to judge the character of such a woman. And then agreeing to marry 3 days after divorce and not allowing the kids to acclimatise and try and build a relationship without pushing her own kid and self on OP - shows just what kind of woman she is.", "NTA always funny when people want to tell you how you should feel. Block her and the aunt.", "NTA. You should block your aunt too, after telling her she can always be the one to babysit", "NTA. Hopefully, she doesn't pull a kid drop. Drop the kid off, ring the doorbell, and run for it. Apparently, it's a thing now. If she does it, please call the police.", "NTA - Block the aunt as well", "NTA and her past entitlement just makes her delusional request on point.\nIf she tries again gives her your babysitting rates and tell her it\u2019s cash up front.  Bet you won\u2019t hear from her again!", "That filial, family oriented aunt can provide all the free baby seating to step niece and her kid. \nOp should go LC with dad's entitled family if not NC. Nta", "NTA", "Sorry, I can\u2019t babysit until \u201cniece\u201d is old enough to comprehend the stories I tell her about her cheating grandfather and unempathetic mother", "She is nothing to you so you are good to go. NTA.", "NTA. This is some pretty next level entitlement. Regardless of her relationship and poor attitude, you don\u2019t owe anyone a babysitting service. The fact you cut her out of your life years ago and she still expects this is astounding", "Why didnt the aunt who gave your number babysit?  It would be different if you had a relationship with the wicked step sister.  The fact that she didnt even have your number shouldve been enough for the aunt to know it wasnt a good idea.", "NTA you dont owe her anything. \nAnd as for the Aunt, that's one less relative you have to keep in touch with.", "NTA\n\nYour step-sister's text message kind of explains why you'd rather not be involved with her.  If her earlier behavior weren't reason enough.", "NTA.  Can't play the family card, when you are not family. Tell the auntie to babysit.", "NTA, stepsister just expecting/demanding OP to babysit is messed up.\nEspecially since she didn't have OPs contact info and seemingly led off with \"hey you babysit for him do it for me\"   who would want to do a favour for someone who pulls that like OPs stepsister.", "NTA\n\nIf you get contacted again I'd report it as harassment, maybe let you aunt know you don't appreciate being harassed about it and if it continues you'll see about pressing charges. You said 'no' and that's enough.\n\nIf you can't press charges (do to state laws) tell her it's $1k an hr with a max of 2-4hr a week."]}
