It is not wrong of you to need a break and spend that entire time relaxing or resting. If you have the ability to take some time off after working to the bone for so long then you should absolutely do it. Your physical health and mental health are more important than any job or commitment. This is just my own opinion but even though family can be important, they are NOT entitled to your time. You can be thankful for them and love them and still need some time to yourself instead of satisfying them. And it honestly sounds a little selfish to me that your mom and family wants you to just go on a trip with them cause they want to go when you don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s your vacation time. Again, nothing you did was remotely in the wrong.", "NTA - Honestly if you take your vacation time and decide to stare at a wall for the whole seven days then even that would be fine.

It was wonderful because it was my time Tell them to stop being so selfish.", "NTA. People termed it a staycation for a reason.  Travel can be expensive and just as exhausting as working at times and if you are not really excited for a trip, it can feel like another task to accomplish.  \n\nI am taking off the entire week of Thanksgiving from work, and aside from making pies and Thanksgiving dinner, I am not doing a single thing that resembles work outside the normal maintenance needs to live (meals, clean up, laundry etc).

Recover, relief stress and get powered up again.\n\n\nThere are many people who think the time off is exclusively for long trips or activities you can't do when you have to go to work.
