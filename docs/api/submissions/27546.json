Tell the landlord that if he contacts you again, except to return your security deposit, you'll contact the police for harassment. Research landlord tenant laws in your area and find out how long your landlord has to return your security deposit or tell you why they are not returning it and penalties for not returning it within that amount of time. Be prepared to file a dispute in court because I can see your landlord withholding your security deposit, claiming it is for the cost of the washer and dryer.", "Not even close for being an asshole. What an entitled shit. Honestly, he's the reason everyone hates landlords. They're cheap af, won't fix anything, raise the rent, and don't care if you live in a broken down apartment, but will balk if you buy something and then take it with you. On what planet could he possibly think that he owned those?", "Obviously NTA\n\nThe landlord is insane. He thought he scored some free appliances from a sucker and now he\u2019s acting like a child. What a greedy dick. The landlord should never have made the assumption that you would leave the appliances behind.", "NTA your old landlord doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. Plus he tried to raise rent based on appliances you paid for. Sounds like he thought he could get away with taking advantage of you and is mad that isn\u2019t the case. Feel free to block him and move on with your life", "NTA. And your ex-landlord is crazzy if he thinks you would give up things you baught yourself for the apartment. \n\nBest contact the post office to inform them that all mail should be send to your new adress - if possible get a mail-tracking app. And then block you landlord. You don't need to hear him sobbing about his mistake. And I fear he will not send any mail to you.", "NTA. They are clearly yours.", "NTA. I had neighbors who rented from the same LL as me and their place had the hook ups in the basement. They chose to get their own Washer and dryer (I think one was gifted to them and the other they bought used) when they moved out they were going into a place with a washer and dryer and told LL they were going to leave theirs behind. She didn't expect it so it was a nice thing for her to tell the text tenant. But again it was their choice.\n\nDo you still have a copy of your old lease? If so does it state that you have to leave them behind if you buy them (I would bet not) if so tell the LL to refer to your lease or that if they want them that badly you will sell them to him for what you paid for them. I guarantee you he will never bother you again.", "Of course Nta", "So silly.  They're yours so of course take them!  He's ridiculous to think he could keep them.", "NTA\n\nYou bought them, they are yours.  Washer and dryer are not installed permanently.

Were you to inform the landlord about taking your undies, clothes, cookware, whatever was yours too??? \ud83e\udd14 Landlord knew it was your stuff - no need for any info here. \nSeems your old landlord will have to buy a washer and dryer now. \ud83d\ude08", "NTA offer to sell him your bf\u2019s old ones in \u201cas is condition.\u201d", "*Obviously* NTA.

Why tell the landlord you're taking your belongings when moving? Do they think you need to tell him about the bed as well? Or the cutlery? That's ludicrous.", "NTA.  You do not need to tell the landlord that you have removed your own property.", "This is ridiculous OP you are clearly in the right here. I mean you even have the receipts LOL tell your landlord \"rip bozo\" and block his dumb ass.", "NTA.   LOL, your old landlord can go straight to hell!!!   He's got no ground to stand upon here.   \n\nYou should post about boar-wrestling Bacon btw.  Sounds funny!", "NTA they are your property, his mistake is his problem.", "NTA and your coworker needs a reality check. You donty need to inform or ask permission for taking YOUR things with you when moving. Period", "Are you an asshole for taking your own property when you moved? No. NTA. And if your landlord involves the police, you have proof that the washer and dryer belongs to you.", "NTA and your landlord can get bent. He has no legal leg to stand on whatsoever. The only things he gets claim to are the things he paid for himself that came with your apartment. When I've moved apartments I don't even leave behind the good shower head I bought myself, I put the original shitty one right back in.
