He's an AH and a jerk with quite a sense of entitlement to his renters' possessions", "NTA You do not have to inform, and especially do not have to ask, your landlord if you can remove your own property from their rental. You own it, you take it with you!\n\nIndeed, pretty darn obvious. \n\nIf landlord wanted the set, he should have negotiated to buy them from you. Not threaten to call the police for taking your rightfully purchased property with you.", "NTA. He\u2019s batshit insane.", "NTAa your coworker is dumb AF and your landlord is dumb AF as well. You paid for them. They are your property. Of course you take them when you leave", "Absolutely, positively NTA.  \nThere is no way he can get around the fact that they weren't there when you moved in and you bought your own. It makes no sense at all that he would assume that you would leave them in the apartment. Taking the washer and dryer is no different than taking your bed! It makes even less sense that he has the nerve to demand that you return them!!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d tell him to get fucked.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re yours. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d expect you to leave them.", "Last place I rented,  I bought & installed ceiling fans. Guess where they are now?\n\nAlso, got tired of going yo the laundry mat a few block up the street a few months after moving in here & bought a pair. (Fortunate too, as it is now a ghost kitchen of sorts.)", "Your coworker is a landlord.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Does your coworker also think that you should have told the landlord that you were taking your tv? Obviously you would take your own stuff, that you paid for. Glad you saved your receipts.", "NTA What on earth makes him think that he has a right to something you bought? I would however track down proof of purchase just in case.", "You could offer to sell him the washer and dryer and he can pick them up", "NTA, the leech is angry that they will have to do something costing their own money. They have no case. As others mentioned, in a lot of places in the US improperly held security deposits and similar lead to treble damages. Just remind your AH former landlord of that.", "Small claims court if he illegally withholds part of the security deposit. In my state, it's treble damages for illegally withholding funds and you have 30 days to get the money back. \n\nObviously, tenant laws can vary widely.", "This is good advice. The landlord shouldn't be able to withhold the security deposit because OP removed items that were their own personal property. We have a Residential Tenancy Bureau in our area, and they were fantastic when we had to deal with an awful former landlord. He tried to keep our security deposit, citing costs that included having to purchase replacement blades for the lawnmower (apartment did not come with a mower, we purchased it while living there, and then sent him a note saying we were happy to leave it for the next tenants as we were moving to an upper floor apartment with no yard) and repairing damage to the fence caused by a neighbour's shed collapsing on it in a windstorm. We ended up going to arbitration supported by the RTB and he lost, comprehensively. Good luck OP, you are NTA but your landlord most certainly is an AH.", "Exactly. Don't ask your coworker for life advice anymore -- maybe they are secretly the landlord....", "He sucks as a landlord if he can't keep track of appliances he owns and where they are -- and by extension, which appliances in his rental he does NOT own.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "You can forward your address online on the usps website super easy, no need to go in person now", "I understand they might be a pain to move, & OP might have chosen to just not bother, but I would have still expected compensation.", "Nope. It was just the hookup. There were no preexisting washers or dryers there, and i have proof I have pciture from when I moved.and I also  have a screenshoot of text where the landlord admits this.", "In some places in the US there are additional penalties if the landlord misses the cutoff date or withholds all or a portion of the security deposit without a valid reason.  In CA for instance it can be up to 3 times the amount withheld without valid reasons.", "If you can find the original listing with \"W/D hookups\" That would be a good thing to save and have on hand as well", "Tell him that he owes his new tenants a washer and dryer, but he does not owe them your washer and dryer.", "Where I live, it's 3 times the amount and fines up to $25,000. So definitely worth it for OP to look at their rights.", "Where I used to rent, it was double the security deposit if not returned or if not provided with why they were not returning it within 30 days. Landlords were also required to hold the deposit in escrow and if renting for more than 2 years, they are required to pay the interest earned on the security deposit.", "The last rental I had came with fridge and oven range, but my landlady was open that they were left by the previous tenant and that she did not normally rent homes with those items. She (and the lease) made it clear that if they broke down, she would not fix or replace them.", "The workaround is to ask for the contact information for the new tenants and offer the pieces to them directly, with the understanding that there is no implied warranty.", "The coworker is stupid. I can't fathom how he thought of that advice", "Each state had a different but yes there are landlord-tenant laws everywhere and a lawsuit over a security deposit is about as common as it gets", "Can you ask him to write you a letter to send to the landlord?  Once landlord knows you have consulted an attorney,  I bet he backs off.", "Well that's good. Keep track of everything he does and go the legal route if he doesn't back down. NTA", "If you are in the U.S., that\u2019s a small claims court case, in which you just represent yourself.  I once filed against a landlord, which made him suddenly see the light and pay my deposit (plus court fees).", "In that case, definitely don\u2019t go to small claims. Make this as difficult on the landlord as possible.", "This, 100%. I used to work in the rental industry. I've seen letters on legal letterhead move mountains for residents/tenants.  Many landlords will back down completely once they know you'll fight them in court."]}
