The problem is that sewing can get quite expensive, seeing that eventually my daughter will want her own sewing equipment including a machine rather than using my wife's. \n\nI pulled my wife aside last night and asked if she could please nip this hobby in the bud. She got upset but I explained that we do not have the money for her to have her own materials. My wife said that while we might not have money to buy our daughter a brand new machine thats of decent quality, we do have money to buy her her own fabric every once in awhile, and that our daughter is welcome to use any of my wife's equipment. I also brought up that sewing can be dangerous with the needle. My wife said that it's no more dangerous than playing outside. This devolved into an argument and I just need some outside input.

It's a skill that used to be taught in middle school (7th-8th grades) so calling it dangerous is absolutely ludicrous. Yes, accidents can gapped- the same with sports, riding in a car or walking down a flight of stairs. It can, in fact, turn into a lucrative skill.", "YTA. Is sewing a euphemism for some other hobby?

You can limit the amount of fabric she can buy and it really isn\u2019t an expensive hobby compared to other hobbies. It is also useful. She can make smaller items that take less fabric and your wife offered to let her use her machine. Also, you can find used machines for reasonable amounts.

She also cosplays in her free time and works at cosplay charity groups where she dresses up as a princess/superhero for kids.\n\nYou could be fueling your daughters future if you invest and take interest in her hobbies now.", "YTA. Sewing is a hobby that is a very useful skill and can save her lots of money in the future. Maybe she can save up money for fabric or a used sewing machine? For now there's no reason why she can't share with your wife as long as she is fine with it.", "YTA. Every hobby can get expensive or it can be as cheap as you make it. Why not look for a used machine, check garage sales, local online sales, why buy a brand new machine for someone who might drop the hobby in a year for all you know. It's only as expensive as you make it. Is she just supposed to not have hobbies? Because every hobby gets expensive the more you get into it.", "YTA. Why would your daughter have to have her own equipment? If it comes to that then you haven\u2019t taught your daughter about sharing.

Out of curiosity, what are your other kids' hobbies, because I bet they're just as 'expensive' in their own ways.", "YTA. my mom taught me to sew by that age and you know when I wanted my own machine?  When I moved to another state...  So there really is no reason to think they can't be perfectly happy sharing for the foreseeable future.  And even when I did get my own machine, it was an older used one for around $100.  It is great because the older models tend to have more metal parts unlike the newer ones which tend to have a lot of plastic.", "I hope your other kids don't play sports or martial arts or anything, given how *dangerous* you find sewing. Not to mention, those hobbies aren't *practical* or *useful* and would be way more expensive than sewing what with coaching, lessons, petrol to and from pickup and games etc.\n\nYou say in another response that if you didn't buy your daughter a sewing machine than this would cause her to say that you never give her anything. I'm just wondering if she says this to you often because it's true in comparison to your other kids? What exactly are their hobbies?", "YTA. The stuff you can buy at rummage sales, through FB marketplace, and through thrift stores make this one of the cheapest hobbies ever and she is learning a wonderful skill. Please get over yourself and your lack of knowledge about this hobby. Your wife might have spent some money on her particular long-term equipment, but the same does not have to apply to your daughter.", "YTA Your child found a creative hobby that gets her away from digital devices, and you're trying to stop that? Not to mention that it's a hobby that already exists in your house, so the upfront cost is minimal. You're actively trying to stop her from learning and exploring at a time when learning and exploring is her only job. \n\nI'm honestly curious what healthy hobby you think you're going to convince her to like that's cheaper than fabric and thread.\n\nInstead of being paternalistic, you could try treating her like a growing human. Talk to her about budgeting, minimizing waste, thriftiness, etc. Tell her that if she wants her own machine one day, she has to save for it out of her budget.\n\nOdds are, she'll forget about sewing after a period of time after exploring the hobby. But if you stop her for nonsense reasons, she'll remember that forever.", "If your 11 y.o. girl wants to learn sewing\u2026.please let her! Of all the hobbies she could get herself into, this one is awesome. She can learn to repurpose fabric from clothing she has outgrown, she is bonding with her mother, and as she will be entering middle school and hell that goes with it over the next few years, it\u2019s vital to form bonds like this now so your daughter will feel comfortable talking to her parents when the big stuff starts to happen in life. Let her, and them, keep sewing and trust that your wife will keep any purchases within your family budget. One day you can get her a starter machine at a cheaper price point. \n\nPlease realize, dance is expensive, football is expensive, theatre is expensive, band is expensive\u2026depending on where you live, and what your local community or Park District or school offers in terms of classes, teams, etc. The hobby your daughter is leaning toward is one of the least expensive among the other choices, and one which will keep her from getting concussions or broken bones if that worries you. If you let her use scissors, you can let her learn to sew. \n\nI learned to sew using my mom\u2019s machine that is as old as I am\u2026as in nearing 50\u2026and I plan to inherit that machine one day. Sewing helped my mom make money while she stayed home when I was a baby and my dad worked. She made all his suits, our clothes, and now she helps with theatre costumes. She even made one of my prom dresses and a baptismal gown from the wedding train of a friend for their son. People are always looking for someone to \u201chem this\u201d or \u201cmake alterations\u201d and if your wife and daughter can do that, it\u2019s not just a hobby but a marketable skill in your area.\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA. Sewing is a great life skill, not just a hobby. You can reasonably save up for a used machine and I\u2019m sure your wife, as a sewer, is happy to help her navigate finding deals on a fabric. If your daughter gets good at it she can save a lot of money wearing her own designs throughout her life.", "YTA, when you said expensive hobby I thought you meant like horseback riding or rowing or something. \n\nSewing does not have to be expensive, it can actually save money in the long run. There are affordable sewing machines and discount fabric stores, not to mention it can help with remaking old clothes that are no longer wearable. \n\nSewing machines are not dangerous unless you intentionally try to get your finger under the needle.", "YTA.\nSewing isn't dangerous.  Sure, you can injure yourself with a needle, but you aren't Sleeping Beauty; it's a minor nuisance.\n\nYour daughter is learning to sew at 11.  That doesn't mean \"any minute now I'll have to buy her a machine.\"  I used my mother's up until I left for college, and then I used my grandmother's.  Do any of your other children have hobbies?

And then there would be the physicals and doctor visits for the injuries plus whatever tests would be needed.\n\nAll hobbies have costs.  Since you don't mention that your daughter is demanding, or even requesting, expensive items, you seem to just not approve of her interest.  Shame on you.

Is their closeness making you uncomfortable?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Sewing is an extremely practical hobby and is a skill that will serve her well as she gets older.", "YTA. Any hobby costs money and there are many ways you could support your daughter with finding reasonably priced equipment (garage sales, etc.). This is also something healthy she can do with her mom so you could be more supportive.", "YTA - if y'all can't afford a machine, and she can't use your wife's for whatever reason, she can legit stitch by hand. Foster the hobby now and she'll have a useful skill for life.", "YTA, it is def not expensive and your just looking for a reason to be controlling. Actually After a buying a machine fabric and thread is very cheap if you don\u2019t go bananas. She doesn\u2019t even need her own machine as she is just starting and they can def share. Sewing machines are very safe to use if properly shown safety then she is def old enough to use one. It\u2019s a great hobby and life skill.", "YTA.  You have really strange ideas.  Sewing is not expensive.  You have years and I mean years to buy her a new one or a second hand machine for a special birthday present if she goes that way in her life.  She has your wife\u2019s machine in the meantime to learn so how is that expensive?  She is bonding and learning with your wife and is learning life skills.   You are the AH for taking that way from not only your child but your wife.   Do you really want them to resent you for this?   Why are you trying to be so controlling.  \n\nSewing is a life skill and can be very beneficial in the future to your child.  If she has a hard time in getting a job she can supplement an income by doing alterations for others but she can make clothes or hand made gifts.  The ideas are endless.  I have a cousin who makes baby clothes who sells them and has her own shop online.  And it has grown huge.  Do you know how many things are sewn?   Clothes, toys, wedding dresses, curtains?, patchwork quilts, bedspreads, pillowcases, cushions, mending, alterations, handbags, baby items not just clothes - bibs, burp cloths, nappies, clothes, pet accessories, pot plant holders, tablecloths, table runners, upholstery in cushions and couches.   There is a huge industry in the sewing market.  As well as going into fashion and design.   \n\nRegardless if you want her in this field or not doesn\u2019t matter.   It\u2019s a life skill that she can learn that is practical and very beneficial in a struggling climate where people struggle to find an income and feed themselves.  Something to fall back on. \n\nSewing is also beneficial for reducing stress, improving hand and eye co ordination, brain development, improve your emotional well being, socialising in the future with sewing groups and making friends, and developing creativity. \n\nIt\u2019s a life skill and practical.  Why would you deny this life skill?? \n\nEdit to add:   You can also look on marketplace on Facebook to get cheap second hand sewing machines and cheap fabric or op shops for practically nothing or garage sales.

It only cost me roughly $300 in materials, and I sewed it with that 15 year old sewing machine. You could seriously be depriving your daughter of something that could give her independence, allow her to develop her creativity, and pride in her skills she honed over, potentially, years, all because start-up costs could be expensive.

You should be very happy that she likes sewing. It's actually not s expensive as most other hobbies. It will actually teach her a skill which will be very useful in the future and saves $. Look for second hand material and sewing machine ...I wish I had learned it when I was younger", "YTA. I have been since I was 8 YEARS OLD. You can find lots of fabric people are selling off because sewers can be shopaholics with our hobby. I\u2019ve got the majority of my fabric and materials from a sewing shopaholic who is unfortunately unable to sew because of the mental disabilities that come with age. A sewing machine is also not that dangerous as long as you keep your fingers a safe distance away from the needle when in motion. They strongly teach this in sewing classes too. You also let the fabric move with the needle, not against it. If you don\u2019t do that, then you are going to get hurt. You should let your daughter have this hobby, it can actually be a very rewarding one later in her life. Sewing creates hand stability, precision for straight lines, and strength in fine motor functions. If she ever wants to work in an industry that requires lots of fine motor functions, she\u2019ll have an advantage with it. I am a phlebotomist working my way for an MLT degree and have incredible stable hands because of my sewing, it makes inserting a needle so much easy. This job requires lots of fine motor functions like collecting blood, pipetting, and inoculation for example, that require hand steadiness. Aside from my bragging, anything made of fabric you see in a store, your daughter could make that in a day or less for so much cheaper than buying it.  She also won\u2019t require her own machine unless she absolutely wants one, which a plan can be made to give her one. Again, Sewing shopaholics, will have a bunch of sewing stuff for sale at discounted prices than new from a retailer. Having this special connection between your daughter and wife is also important for their relationship. I could tell you my whole life story and how important knowing how to sew has become, and how much is has benefited me, but I doubt you\u2019ll read this comment.

Thank your lucky stars your daughter didn't pick up knitting.", "I thought this was going to be horse or major equipment related. Good grief. YTA. There are so many used sewing machines around. So many thrift shops and discount fabric shops around. I\u2019d say it might be one of the lesser expensive hobbys for someone her age.", "YTA. First, there\u2019s no need for sewing to be expensive. I sew and can do so very cheaply given that your wife already has the machines. Your daughter may want her own one day. At that point, you can decide what you want to do. Maybe it\u2019s a Christmas gift you save for. Maybe daughter helps save for it. Who cares? Daughter will likely be quite content with your wife\u2019s machines for quite awhile. Also, it\u2019s really not dangerous. It\u2019s one small needle (or two depending on the type). If your wife is teaching her correctly and monitoring her, there shouldn\u2019t be an issue.

I\u2019m a member of IATSE and learned upon swearing in that Custom Made makes up a paltry 12% of membership in my area. I\u2019m almost entirely self taught before I began working. Imagine if your daughter chooses to go into design or technical courses, her earning potential will surge upward. Let her learn, let her create, let her explore her interests.

Not to mention that you can get discounted fabric at used stores. It's not that expensive if you know where to look....\n\nPLUS it's a good skill for her to learn. I'm not the best sewer but I can fix clothes when they rip or buttons when they come off.\n\n Why they hell would you want to stop her from learning this?? Money is not as big of an issue as you're making it because your wife is fine letting her use her machine and share other supplies, and you can get used fabrics.

She might outgrow the hobby but if she doesn't, just put your foot down that she has to figure out a way to buy her own machine if she wants one. \nOn a more constructive note: maybe you can steer her towards embroidery.

From the sound of it in my opinion you sound like that you don't want your child to learn a old-timey hobby which is sewing.

I just did a quick search, and good housekeeping has a list of the best machines for 2023. The top rated one sells on Amazon for $229. They're not crazy expensive like OP is insisting. And when I was her age or younger, I helped my mom sew and she taught me cross stitch. It was not dangerous by any means. Sure, fabric can be expensive, and a good set of shears, thread, buttons, etc on top of the machine can add up, but its still probably cheaper than a ps5 and lets her bond with her mom while learning an important skill.", "In the US, if he checked NextDoor for 6 months (generously, it would take much less time tbh) he could get her a secondhand machine for cheap or free.", "Yeah! My local goodwill usually has a minimum of two or three old sewing machines to choose between, for about twenty bucks a pop.

There are sewing machines all over FB marketplace.", "I was a figure skater growing up and was ready to defend OP because damn if I knew then what I know now, but SEWING???? Jfc I WISH I could sew, it would save me so much money in the long run and it\u2019s so COOL to be able to make things. My mom saved us money on figure skating costs by sewing at least half of my costumes.", "Same my oldest was into horse back riding ~ Hunter Jumper. Anything involving horses is expensive.\n\n\nHeck I can think of so many things more expensive than sewing", "Definitely! OP doesn't realize how lucky he is. Some kids' hobbies are insanely expensive. Hockey? Skiing? Horses? Even gaming is pricier than sewing. \n\nOP wishes his daughter's hobby was playing with dolls she makes out of old toilet paper rolls.", "Same", "As someone was horse-obsessed throughout my childhood and teen years, and eventually had to give up riding due to the cost, I thought the same thing. In no universe would I consider hobby sewing an expensive pastime!", "Came here to say this : could be worse, might be horses... count your blessings!", "That is exactly what I thought it was going to be!!!! Definitely YTA. Thank your lucky stars it\u2019s not horses (or gymnastics/dance/ice skating! One month of any of those would keep you in fabric for years!

OP is utterly YTA.", "I ride/own a horse and let me tell you, I WISH my hobby/sport was as cheap as sewing.

I would totally get it if that was the case... but sewing?  lol come on!  Yep OP is YTA", "Yeah, horses, figure skating, gymnastics, dance, that's what I was expecting. Sewing?!?! A decent used machine can often be gotten for about $100. Sewing can be practically free depending on what you're making and what type of fabric you use.", "Yeah if it was horses then I would totally understand. But sewing is fairly affordable as hobbies go.", "Same.  And then I open it and it's fucking sewing?  Like, it's a hobby, but it's also a LIFE SKILL.\n\nI wish I knew how to sew.  Made sure to teach my kids the basics of loom knitting, because passing skills on to your kids is kind of one of my favorite parts of parenting.\n\nOP, YTA.\n\nAlso, did anyone else catch the subtle neg at his wife for her \"expensive\" hobby?", "ugh that is triggering, I loved horsback riding as a child. And my parents very clearly did not want to pay for it. They discouraged the only thing I loved. And would argue in front of me about who would take me. Since neither wanted to.

Your kid deserves to explore her options, and especially one mom is invested in, not to mention one that will serve her very well for years to come.", "Right? If sewing with mom is too expensive, there is not going to be ANY hobby that is cheap enough for OP. He apparently doesn\u2019t want his kids to have any hobbies at all.", "Also, idk where OP is located but I love sewing and almost all my fabric was bought at thrift stores. If you go to the blanket/curtain section sometimes you get lucky and find huge bundles of fabric that someone tossed. I've gotten like 10 yards of pink satin that I adore. I also love sewing with curtains - makes really unique pieces. Also there are usually lace ones which is awesome", "Mine plays travel hockey...\ud83d\ude27 we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into...", "Holy crap, yeah. As a former \u201cdance mom\u201d this one is up there. The lessons, shoes, leotards and tights, costumes, recital fees, conventions, competitions\u2026 rinse and repeat every year.\n\nYTA, OP.  Sewing is a wonderful, inexpensive and extremely useful hobby that will benefit your daughter (and her mom) for a lifetime.", "You should see the cost of bassoon reeds.", "I love riding!

It taught me invaluable lessons. I wouldn't be able to mend clothes like I can, especially not doing things like hemming pants/tailoring shirts to fit myself and fam. For years my brother had trouble finding shirts that fit his slim frame so I'd just take the sides in.\n\nAlso is awesome if something is just slightly big. Being able to fit that to my body saves me from having to buy brand new things.", "(Traditionally the word is seamstress, but sewist is the contemporary non-gendered term)", "Never too late to learn!", "Plus repairing and repurposing!", "I was wondering what OP\u2019s hobbies are. Are they free?", "That would be\u2026wow.", "Oh god don't get me started on embroidery!", "It starts by buying fabric then the next thing you know she\u2019s snorting floss on the street!!", "As someone who cross stitches it\u2019s soo dangerous!!!

I\u2019d die", "Gosh, just being able to hem your own pants, make alterations, fix tears or holes properly is a super valuable skill!", "If she can sew, she can op-shop and adjust clothes to fit her perfectly. My sister sews and sometimes she finds the perfect item of clothing and can remake it in different fabrics. Of course, sewing isn't always cheaper - sometimes you can spend a lot of money on fabric etc, but in the long run, it's a great hobby. \n\nIt may be a stretch, but I also don't love the fact that it's a man criticizing his daughter getting into a typically feminine hobby that doesn't have to be expensive - if his son was getting into a sport OP played that would have him buying new sneakers and uniforms and equipment, would he say no?", "So much this. My SIL taught herself to sew after she got married to my brother. Eventually she started her own Etsy shop. She now makes triple what I make off that Etsy shop. Sewing is a valuable life skill. \n\nI also wonder what hobby OP thinks doesn\u2019t cost money? Sports? Dance? Art? All hobbies are expensive once you hit a certain point.", "Very profitable.  The cheapest place around me to get fabric is a goodwill outlet that sells clothes by the pound.  They occasionally have bolts of fabric but more often I am getting creative with something way too big.", "Right? Sewing is such a great life skill to have, even if you only use it for hemming/letting out/mending. His wife was 100% right and I'm so confused why he would want to discourage this. I was into sewing as a kid and we didn't have a machine at all---I learned on one at the fabric store that they let kids try out and otherwise hand-sewed, and used my grandma's when we went over there. Why prevent her from learning a skill on equipment they already own?", "Had a friend who loved sewing and cosplaying and started making and selling custom costumes. She made quite a lot of money from that.", "Sometimes I do creative stuff with my sewing, but often it's just practical. Most recently, I cut the stained hem off my shower curtain and sewed a new hem. I also got some curtain panels I needed on sale, and some were too long, so I hemmed them. I have also been taking in the lower armhole of some of my tops because they gap (why do designers think that when you go from a L to an XL, your arms double in size?). I also rehemmed a bath towel where the hem had unraveled, and at some point I'm making covers for the arms of our new love seat which the cat has been scratching. Sewing is such a great skill to have. It saves money.", "She could make hair scrunchies I made a bunch of those. Wow she can sell to buy fabric \ud83e\udd23", "You can also make gifts for people and they'd often appreciate them more than if you just bought them.", "Yes, my niece mostly wears clothes that she has re-cut and sewn from thrift store finds. She re-makes them into items that look custom designed and it is amazing!", "Yes! Beyond the obvious savings from DIY amending and such (holy cow professional tailoring can be costly), there are career paths - Disney, Broadway, fashion houses, etc. if she decides that she loves it that much. \n\nI follow a couple of 20somethings on Instagram who are amazing sewists. They have managed to make enough money from views and such that they have paused their education, are traveling the world, doing red carpets with Disney, have been featured online and on news programs.", "This. You don\u2019t even want to know how many hundreds I spent on handmade masks at the height of Covid. Hundreds. Lots of hundreds because we both needed enough to get us through a week or so at a time and because I wanted fun ones. \n\nThen, I think about how much I\u2019ve spent to have pants hemmed and it\u2019s insane.

Two of those are true toy/absolute ass machines. Only two are worth looking at or getting. The one they list as the top one is\u2026 okay, it\u2019s fine, but the one they have at #3 is better than any of them.\n\nIdk how some of these lists are made but it\u2019s not as simple as a Google search, unfortunately.\n\nBut you\u2019re right, even if they buy new then it\u2019s still less expensive than a PS5 - for the price of that game system they could get her a machine, all the add ons like nice shears, pins, etc, AND she would learn a valuable life skill (and the cost of material would easily be the same as a new game for the system!)", "For some reason, I feel like the bonding with the mother is actually his problem...", "I learned to knit, crochet, sew, and do both cross-stitch and needlepoint in school when I was about OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s age. You can k*ll someone with a knitting needle. Not so much danger with the other crafts above. \n\nAlso, lest anyone think I learned these to be a SAHM or similar, I became a physician. While I was in practice (before I retired) I made skating dresses for myself at MUCH less expense than buying one pre-made, plus, as an adult skater, my body looked better in the styles I made than in the ones being sold. I have needlepoint and cross stitch pieces hanging in my home. I didn\u2019t keep up with knitting or crocheting.", "And isn\u2019t any more or less expensive than a hobby like painting. Canvass, paints, and brushes also cost $$! \n\nMost hobbies take a certain amount of investment. Unless he forbids her from any hobbies, OP is going to have to suck up some monetary cost somewhere.", "I grew up poor. Like a nap for supper sometimes poor. But my mom taught me how to sew, and now I sell quilts and make money on sewing. Though I will admit sewing clothing is something I can do, but I hate it. I bought my machine second hand for $100, and when I started, i would ONLY buy the fabric I needed for a project. Can it be expensive? Yes, but it also has the potential to save money too.", "I assumed she was wanting to collect Maseratis or something. Sewing. A seriously useful skill and they already own the equipment.", "My coworker son is a tennis player and its so expensive with lessons, gear, new sneakers every few months.

My mom and sister saw how important doing pottery was to me and helped me buy the expensive equipment so I could work at home while the kids were little. I sell my stuff now to finance my work. I come from a family of artists, my mom is an amazing quilter and seamstress and my dad is a professional photographer so they understand the importance of creativity.", "I'm a seamstress with an Etsy Shop with a niche product and when I was on a subreddit for sewing, people did not believe me when I told them I made over $100 an hour as a seamstress.

I sew mostly vintage pieces of clothing and literally just bought 7 yards of fabric for 22 bucks. Even patterns are cheap when they go on sale (both in my local Joann fabrics and even on the manufacturer's website). Sewing is a valuable skill that has saved me a ton of money, accommodated my style, and ensures that I have clothing that actually fits my figure. I have friends regularly beg me to teach them how to sew. Oh, and I started sewing with my mom at five and won first place in a local competition at seven so its hardly dangerous", "Sewing knit fabrics to such a tight tolerance is *hard*!

A specifically designed and sewn item in fabric you've picked out is going to last so much longer and look so much nicer than some trash that costs less than that. And if you search for cheaper fabrics (you can find some in op-shops or on fb marketplace, to name a few places), in the end it's not always more expensive than the fast fashion that won't last as long and is bad for the earth.\n\nI knit, and I know that that's more expensive than buying machine-knitted options, but even with that, it's fun, it's relaxing, and I end up with what I want, not what the shop has decided I want. This guy is such a weirdo.", "On the opposite side, I have a 36\u201d inseam and even tall trousers are too damn short. Even though it sucked, I used to make suits for work when I needed them. It saved me a bunch of money, they lasted forever, and they looked good. They were long enough and I looked put together with a tailored suit.", "There were times in my life where $22 without a definite plan, was too much. It meant not eating for 3 days.

Now I have a fabric hoarding problem, but that\u2019s for another discussion.", "I always used spandex. It wasn\u2019t too hard to use and I always used a stretch stitch.

Other than the dozens of pajama pants for my daughters, that's one clothing item I've never learned to be good at. I have made a blazer jacket, but man, that's a lot of work. I bow to you!", "I feel you. For a few years I was gifted cloth cast-offs from people because buying would affect how I could afford daily necessities. That's awesome that you make money from sewing. I won't sew to sell as I hate doing things like quilting and sewing for measurements can get tricky. Whatever fabric I don't use gets scrapped for my mother who does quilt. I'm with you though, I do have a 'slight' hoarding problem with fabric but that just means I'm prepared for anything lol.", "I have come up with a lot of excuses for keeping a hoard of fabric, but they\u2019re all crap. It\u2019s my security blanket. Quilting for me is almost meditative, and stops me from multi-tasking, which is good for me. I don\u2019t make custom products, unless I feel like it. I had no idea there was a market for them, but they sell. For far more than they\u2019re worth, in my opinion."]}
