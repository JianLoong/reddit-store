For context, my husband works in private security.\n\nEarlier this past week, I hung out with my siblings to plan a Memorial Day BBQ and just catch up. My sister brought up this TikTok trend where people describe their partner's beige flag - a weird quirk that makes you pause for a bit, then just move on with the relationship.\n\nWe all were sharing our partners' little quirks, and I mentioned what I felt was my husband's: every night, the last thing he does before going to bed is a \"perimeter check.\" He literally gets out of bed with a flashlight and walks the treeline around our property, looking for anything out of the ordinary. If he doesn't do it, he won't sleep until he does. He even does it at hotels when we're on vacation. I find it super endearing - it's one of the ways he shows his love for myself and our daughter.\n\nWe hosted a barbeque for our families yesterday. My husband was sort of meandering around, checking to make sure trash was put away properly as our area can sometimes have bears. My BIL made a mean comment to him about doing a \"perimeter check\" early in the day and I think it embarrassed my husband a bit. He can be very shy and I think it just put him out a bit. I chewed my BIL out for being an ass.\n\nLast night, I apologized to my husband for BIL's behavior and passed along an apology from my sister. My husband was still pretty upset and said that it's his private thing he does, and he didn't think it was right of me to have told my siblings. He even called it mean for me to have done. I said I didn't think it was a big deal, especially when he does it in full view of our neighbors and strangers when we're on vacation. I didn't say it to embarrass him, I was moreso sharing something I love about him. He didn't really accept that and said he didn't want to talk about it.\n\nThings were tense over breakfast this morning and when he came home, he said he was still feeling upset with me and wanted some time to himself. I feel like he's overreacting, but I also don't keep many things private so I don't know how it feels to be this guarded.\n\nAITA for telling my siblings about my husband's \"beige flag\"?", "created_utc": 1685483480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w3a3a/aita_for_telling_my_siblings_about_my_husbands/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whether it\u2019s OCD, trauma based or just habit it\u2019s probably something he can\u2019t help and didn\u2019t want shared with the world.

Also, you take no responsibility for what you did, and are trying to gaslight him into believing he's the one in the wrong.", "Was your husband ever in the military?", "NTA You just used bad judgement in this case. You shoulda been able to share w your sister without worrying it would be used as a joke. Doesn\u2019t sound like you were hopping on a trend, just that the trend spurred a conversation you couldn\u2019t resist, but I\u2019m sure you will in the future. I\u2019m sorry you & your sweet man both feel so bad. I hope he sees past his embarrassment to your benign intentions.\n\nEDIT: Does anyone even thoroughly *read* these confessions before voting? There is a vast distance btw what she did & what her BIL did and btw *when* she did her deed, & the party day, when he did his.", "You were incorrect, and you hurt him by sharing it. It is completely reasonable, especially with the delivery, that he would be uncomfortable with other people knowing about it. Even if you meant no harm, slight AH behavior. Now let\u2019s look at your response\u2026\n\nWhen your husband does something, carelessly, in the heat of the moment, etc., that hurts your feelings, how do you want him to respond? Do you want him to acknowledge that he did something hurtful, apologize, and change his behavior, or do you want him to get defensive and say it\u2019s no big deal? Which one are you doing right now?\n\nTHAT\u2019S why YTA! I would recommend apologizing genuinely, accepting some discomfort, and never doing this kind of thing again.", "Oh ok I had to go through and find that bit because she did apologize for her BIL. But in that case I think it\u2019s ESH \u2014 her for not apologizing and him for making a big deal out of something he does in public being told to someone else. If it was because she wanted to make fun of him, then Y T A. But you can see in this post that she really loves him and thinks his behavior is \u201cendearing\u201d, and is fucking up this time, not as a habit.", "He", "I'm glad hear that, knew someone it happened to. He still doesn't feel completely safe unless he does it and you made fun of him for it. You may say you find it endearing but you still made fun of him.", "This is a leading question but I don't have the directions lol", "You know the whole basis for the beige flag thing **IS** to make fun of and mock people, right?  That's exactly what you did.\n\nIt would kind of sting to think that what you're doing is right by you and the people you love, only to find out that the love of your life thinks it's \"an odd and annoying quirk\".  That's what a beige flag is. You said that about something your husband does every single day without fail, something that is an essential part of his being, and now he thinks you find it odd and annoying.", "But you did.\n\nApologize, promise not to do it (spread gossip about him), and ask how you can make it up to him.\n\nYTA and so is at least some of your family.", "Tbf the salt and ice challenge was a thing wayyyyy before tik tok but yea social media in general starts some really bad trends.", "If you press only the 1 or 2 or 3 and wait a second, our microwave does that many minutes AND has a +30 seconds button. I keep microwaving things for like 2 seconds at work because I'm spoiled.", ".....pfft. NO. Of course not. Like..who does that. Certainly not me. That..was just my beige flag story about a friend....of a friend. Because I wouldn't be friends with someone that does that.", "Yep that was my first thought too.", "It's called hyper-vigilance and it's not healthy at all.", "Or it can be ADHD or OCD.\n\nI do this all the time. I double check to make sure doors are locked and everything is closed.\n\nLock a door walk away.  Did I lock that door? Go check it again.\n\nTake the dog outside in the morning. Getting ready for bed. Did I lock the downstairs patio door?\n\nI never realized it until my mom brought it up when my wife and I were visiting her for vacation.\n\n\"I always feel safe with Malakyte around because ever since he was little he would always make sure the doors and windows were locked\"\n\nIf I don't do my evening check I will toss and turn in bed until I actually get up and check.", "I swear they need to start teaching basic shit like taking responsibility for your actions and how to apologize sincerely in school.

This isn't about not keeping secrets, it's about allowing your spouse to be safe being vulnerable with you", "I silenced the microwave at work because I got tired of hearing it go off when people left their food in it.", "That beige flag is looking slightly pink, buddy. Keep an eye on that friend of a friend.", "The only time it's not healthy is when it becomes paranoia. Which this doesn't seem to be the case. Making sure you and your loved ones are safe at all times isn't unhealthy by any means.", "It's not something he does behind closed doors, he literally does it outside in public. He's fine to express his discomfort; holding on to it suggests he may not be in control of this behavior and may need to ask for help. Which is his responsibility to communicate.", "This is a daily habit that he does, and was doing in clear view of everyone. It's kinda messed up to say you can't talk about your experiences you have with your partner's behavior, just because it might possibly hurt his feelings - especially a public and conspicuous behavior. And she painted it in a positive light, he's probably great at perimeter checks, he works in security.", "We couldn't silence the one in our office until I brought in an ice pick.\n\nDid you know you can locate the speaker on one of those things pretty easily with just a little googling on your break? They make a satisfying little popping noise when you poke a single hole in the speaker.\n\nPoke about 6 holes in it and you'll NEVER hear it again.\n\nThe office assumed the thing just got old and stopped beeping.\n\nOnly I know the truth that it was meticulously silenced with the stealthy application of a smuggled ice pick!!", "You are 100% wrong.\n\nI will not talk about any experiences I have with my wife's behavior. That's a part of our relationship - it's between me and her. It is not available for public comment. I expect the same of her.\n\nIf I wanted support or advice from a friend with respect to something she had done, or how I felt about it, then I would talk to that friend only on the condition that the friend kept this private.", "Fact is that it's weird. Not bad, but weird. Who does perimeter checks in hotels?
