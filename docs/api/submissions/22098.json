If people are going to hold a traditional wedding and reception (with guests, food, music, the whole shebang) there is at least *some* level of  attention you want for that special day. You are spending time, effort and money to make that day special - it's not narcissistic or selfish to want it to actually feel special.

A wedding is about celebrating the love you and your partner have for eachother, and it is a ritual joining of your lives together. Yes, it is nice to have a party to celebrate the both of you, but if you're worried about losing the spotlight, then you have a very wrong and immature view of what a wedding is and should be.\n\nHowever big or small either your wedding or theirs os going to be, the is only one wedding that is about *you* and *your partner*, and the focus should be about making it an important and meaningful and personalised celebration of *your love*, and if you're comparing notes with a completely different couple, then you've misunderstood what a wedding is and have already failed at making it about these essentials.", "Clearly, you have an inferiority complex.

You are just marrying becouse it is expekted of you. So what is the problem if neither of you actually care?", "Welp. I thought there could be a logical reason. Instead of all these mental gymnastics OP can just say she don't like it.

They might talk about this thing or that thing for a little while but then it becomes a thing they did in the past. \n\nThe only people who are likely to cherish the memory of your wedding day are you and your partner. \n\nIf you are looking for anything else you will be disappointed and come back here asking if YATA for being upset that auntie so and so didn't notice this small detail of your wedding.

There's nothing wrong with it. Since you know what your SIL wants you can literally make your wedding stand out.", "Miss, you are jealous. Maybe not of her and her relationship specifically, but if you're worried she will take the spotlight from you, that's pretty much the definition of jealousy.\n\nThat being said, moving your own wedding isn't the worst thing in the world. You do you, I guess. You can claim you don't want to expect people to pay for participating in more than one wedding next year.\n\nBut yes, you should definitely apologise to your future SIL. For being slightly cold towards her, and - whether intentionally or not - guilting her for wanting to get married the same year as you.

Its about love,  not 'me me me'", "I hope you mean a wedding is about \u201cspotlight/attention\u201d, because a marriage should not be about that. You sound very jealous of your SIL and you should definite figure out why. Also why get married if you don\u2019t really care about marriage? I mean you already have a child outside of wedlock, so it doesn\u2019t seem like you would care about traditions a lot.

WTF does that even mean \u2018people will think you copied her\u2019.  Grown adults just do not think this way!  People get married all the time. It\u2019s just not that special. \n\nI also got married young; I\u2019m not against people marrying young in principal - but the fact that you are  talking the way you are makes it really concerning to think you are raising a child since you very much are one yourself.

For your mental heatlh,  just post phone your wedding or escalate it.  3 months gap to soon for same family and as u said,  u both have same taste ppl will say u copied her,  so better postphone your wedding and enjoy at fullest.  Its common for ppl suddenly want to get married when seeing their closest fam/fren get married.", "Yes, you can look for different decor or a vibe altogether.", "Gosh then have birds fly and pop over them...

You would have already chosen your decorations, venues, colour schemes before her wedding so no one is going to think that. Also there is a huge amount of different combinations of decor, colour schemes, table arrangements- I highly doubt it will be exactly the same as your SIL. \n\nWedding guests don\u2019t care about stuff like because weddings aren\u2019t patented or copyrighted.
