When my dad taught me how to handle my period we lived in a different country and he gave me a reusable pad, which is just some cloth and told me to wash them when they got dirty. He never got me pads or tampons and said that this was better.\n\nSome years back we moved to the UK and here my school has pads and tampons in the loo. Recently I decided to start taking some of them and taking extra to take home. I do not mind the reusable one my dad gave me but I find them less convenient as I have to wash them and they do not fit as well which has led to a few embarrassing incidents at school. Luckily though none of my classmates were ever mean about it.\n\nMy dad recently found the used tampons in the bin and he got angry with me then found the extra tampons and pads I stole from school in my room. He forbade me from taking them again and threw them out. I got upset since I am the one who does most of the chores like emptying the bins so he should not have seen it.\n\nI do not understand, my teachers specifically said we could take extra if we needed so I do not think it is stealing. In my other country I know girls use both cloth and pads and tampons but here in the UK everyone uses the disposable products. My dad also makes me eat after my brother and him when I am on my period even when I do the cooking and it bothers me as the other girls at school do not have to do this. He says this is respect for our culture and nothing about germs.\n\nEdit: I cannot do anything that will get my dad or family in trouble. We are not citizens here and I do not want issues for our visas. I want to leave home when I go to university and I am waiting for us to get indefinite leave to remain status. My dad expects to find a boy for me to marry from a nice family but I know he cannot force me to do that here, so I pretend like I will do that until I am an adult.", "created_utc": 1675710532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vf2xc/aita_for_stealing_tampons_and_pads_from_school/", "score": 557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is there a teacher or another family member you trust who you could talk to about this? This needs outside intervention ASAP", "NTA and your dad is using \"culture\" as an excuse to be archaicly misogynistic. I'd hazard a guess that he has some dumb belief about chastity and tampons. \n\nDo you have any adult females in your life that could advocate for you to be able to have the hygiene products you need? \n\nI would also look into getting a silicone cup. If you can manage to get money to buy one, they last a long time, leak less than pads, and are a breeze to keep clean.

I don't even know what to say. This has made me very upset. You definitely need more than 1 reusable pad and as long as you are not cleaning out the entire stock every time, a couple of pads and/or tampons is not a big deal.

You're not stealing them, they're there to be used by the people who need them. Your dad is being controlling and potentially abusive-he can't have an opinion on which form of menstrual product is best because he doesn't menstruate. Different people prefer different methods, and he should be supportive of you finding the type of product you prefer, not forcing you to use reusable cloths if you're not comfortable with those. What happens if you're on a sleepover or a weekend away and can't conveniently clean it? You need to have a conversation about your biological needs and rights-you have a basic human right to access the equipment you need.

Ever think of trying a menstrual cup?  It's reusable so your Dad wouldn't find it in the trash.  Sounds like he might be snooping around though since you mentioned he found used products in the trash, but you're the one who usually empties it.  If you go the menstrual cup route, make sure to hide it well when you're not using it.  \n\nAlso, maybe a female teacher or counselor at school has some good advice.", "Oh, sweetie, of course, you are NTA. Your whole situation makes me incredibly sad with a father who disrespects you. Please keep getting those feminine products from your school and friends and hide the disposal of them better. You deserve a modicum of privacy and respect for what is core to a woman's hygiene. Hugs to you from an internet stranger.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t recommend a menstrual cup as it needs to be disinfected in boiling water and that might be an issue for you. In general make sure you are safe with whatever product you use.

You\u2019re not stealing - you\u2019re taking those products to use which is the reason they are there!\n There\u2019s cultural issues here, and your dignity is incompatible with a patriarchal religion.

However, you're getting a lot of advice in this post that might be challenging to follow.\n\nSometimes people with a Western background who haven't experienced other cultures (first-hand for extended periods of time) have certain opinions.

You _shouldn't_ have to, but things are often not ideal. You already know what you're doing, but here are some additional points to keep in mind.\n\nPlay along and be prepared to make an abrupt pivot as soon as you're legally clear. You do have to make appropriate preparations to move out:\n\n- Be prepared for a hell of an argument once you reveal your true intentions\n\n- Have access to your own passport and documents, and make a copy of everything for yourself\n- Are there any other personal possessions that you would never move out of the house without? If so, secure access to them\n- Be prepared to combat a claim that you can go to uni while living at home\n- Save money where you can\n- Take up a marketable hobby, if you can, that can earn some money on the side, or attain some skills that can get you hired quickly\n\nWhen the time comes, the intent is to introduce this as amicably as possible, but you have to be ready for if things go awry.", "No honey.

A big difference between tampon and disposable pads is that the tampon is inserted in your vagina while the pad is not. \n\nBased on what you said about your culture, I am guessing his disinclination about the tampons is that is has something to do with your virginity.

Just in case you don't hear that enough.", "Oh sweetheart. You are absolutely the farthest thing from  TA. If there are resources available at your school, please take advantage. Unless you report abuse, I doubt your dad will get in any trouble. Please take care.", "I am very sorry you are experiencing this. I would recommend that you consider talking to people who may be able to help you, such as [www.karmanirvana.org.uk](https://www.karmanirvana.org.uk), as you seem to be living in an extremely male-dominated situation. [www.childline.org.uk](https://www.childline.org.uk) may also be helpful for advice.\n\nThere are women-supporting organizations in the UK that will not put your immigration status at risk, please get some help, to help you plan for leaving your father's household, in case it has to be done quickly and before you are presently planning to. Wishing you the very best of luck, OP.\n\n(I'm Canadian but used to live in the UK, and was requested to give career advice to the daughters of immigrants on a couple of occasions.)\n\nNTA, of course. :)", "Have you heard of those menstrual cups that are reusable?  Your father would have no idea you were using one.  My girls swear by them (USA).  Wondering if the issue (for Dad) is the virginity thing with the tampons.  Be stealth and good luck.", "I\u2019m so sorry. I wish that I could give you a gentle hug right now. Obviously, you are up against a lot of cultural sexist issues in your situation. No young woman should ever need to feel that she has to compromise her dignity over something as basic as menstrual products. I don\u2019t see what you did as stealing. You are NTA.", "So I agree that OP isn\u2019t an AH, but cloth pads aren\u2019t \u201cchild abuse.\u201d Frankly, I use them, because 1) they\u2019re better for the environment, 2) tampons and pads are often made of basically toxic ingredients, and 3) I find them more comfortable.", "Exactly. Vaginas bleed. This is not new knowledge, and yet, so many damned assumptions. \ud83d\ude22", "One of my friend\u2019s husbands was like that.  WTF - did he think he was going to contract hemoglobin?  He\u2019s now an ex.", "This is what I do now, hide them better, hide used ones until I dispose at school.\n\nThen I pretend like I use the cloth by washing it and putting it to dry.", "We are not muslim and not religious and this is not a widespread thing in my country since my grand parent's generation, even there people do not do this unless they are poor and destitute.\n\nMy friend's mum helps me a lot and said she can buy me anything and I could stay with her daughter for uni.", "He refuses to buy reusable pads too. The traditional one is just a cloth so there is not really a fit.", "I do not want to escalate things too much, and make him punish me by shouting and taking away my laptop which I need for school and entertainment.\n\nI play to move out for uni and my friend \u00b4s mum says I can stay with her daughter for uni.", "Thank you!\n\nI will keep this in mind, I am still on a visa but should have indefinite leave to remain soon.", "I like the idea of the cloth, but girl, you gotta do what makes you comfortable! I know he's your dad but he's being a little creepy", "Maybe pack your used items in a plastic bag and dispose of them outside the house. You *shouldnt* have to do that but I understand the difficult situation you're in.", "Is there an older respected woman from your community that your dad would listen to?  An Auntie or someone?", "If you read OPs comments you\u2019ll find that her dad is extremely misogynistic and abusive. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s buying her nice, environmentally friendly cloth pads. She literally means a cloth, like a piece of fabric.", "Hell, some dudes think we can \"hold it in\". \ud83d\ude29", "Okay that\u2019s a good plan, I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this, I also attend school in the uk so if you ever need to talk just dm me x", "Can you move to Scotland? You can sign contracts there at 16. See if you can do your A-levels somewhere else. If he takes away your laptop that you need for school, he's probably going to get in trouble. Please talk to one of your friend's mom's about all of this and see if an adult can help you. \n\nI can't deal with how many people abuse their kids.", "fingers crossed for you!", "That is what I do now.", "I was speaking ONLY about the cloth pads. The OP\u2019s father is certainly misogynistic and abusive in other ways. But you said that OP\u2019s dad not providing tampons was abuse. That\u2019s simply not true.", "My friend\u00b4s mum does know and that is why she helps me. She does not want to get too involved and thinks it is best for me to hold up until I am 18.", "I think you're right..... And that just makes me more mad!!!! \n\nThe level of misogyny it takes to put this much stigma on a natural, healthy body fonction, I just can't understand!", "Do not under any circumstances go on vacation back to your home country. If your father shows you this amount of care for your health then he might marry you off to someone.", "Could you maybe see if he would be willing to buy you period underwear? I have friends who say they're great or even a diva cup, you could see if a school counselor could get you a cup so you won't have feminine hygiene products he would recognize at home.", "That could seriously backfire if he also has concerns about the propriety of a man's involvement (e.g., why is this strange man interested in my daughter's period?)", "Yikes. I'm sorry he's such an ass! Do you know any women in your community you could talk to? Your dad probably won't listen to them either, but they may either have better ways to approach him or at least better info for you on how to use the damn things - I'll bet your dad got an auntie to show you once and then never wanted it spoken of ever again \ud83d\ude44", "I think a cup is the way to go because it's either always in you or you can wash it and keep it somewhere hidden amongst your things, there would be 0 trace of using it, and it also reduces the risk of toxic shock syndrome, especially if you ever have to keep tampons or pads longer than necessary because of the danger in hiding them", "That is nice of you thanks, luckily I have friends who said they can help me and one of their mum's said I can ask her for anything I need. \n\nShe also said I could stay with her daughter for uni if we get into the same school. I have no trouble accessing products for free in the UK as many places offer them.", "This isn't about whether they're free or not, so I'm pretty sure that wouldn't change anything. This about the dad being controlling and wanting to enforce cultural norms from their original country.", "I asked and tried to insist already, he insists that the traditional one is the best. (which is just a piece of cloth not really a fitting garment)", "OP is in a \"damned if you do/damned if you don't\" situation.", "We are not asylum seekers, he came here on a visa with us as dependents", "I worry about that too. My friend was married off at 12 to her cousin back home", "NTA Get your citizenship, go to university and never look back.  Keep your thoughts to yourself until you\u2019re free.", "1. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AGREE TO TRAVEL HOME FOR HOLIDAY.\n\n2. Get the note from a teacher with the excuse that your father is ashamed and thinks that you are stealing them. That will angry him but will also scare him off from doing some out of our century things.\n\n3. Get away. Especially in the UK there are NGOs started by women who were in your situation or worse. Get help.\n\n4. Smile and wave and play dumb until you get out. Sorry but men like your father will never see women as more than tools to make their lives more comfortable.", "I know it obviously doesn\u2019t begin to touch on the issues at hand, but is it possible to use the disposables while at school to at least prevent accidents and use the other one at home?", "Nope, but if dad is just misguided, could be small educative steps to maybe improve things.", "In that case you may have more options.  Speak to  citizens advice bureau to see what your options are.", "OP idk if this would help you because you probably already know, but just in case you dont.\n\none thing I do when I want to hide something in the trash is crumple it in a piece of paper, then throw it away, sometimes multiple papers so if it is blood, nothing leaks through", "Yes and/or that Dad will decide that the UK is too much of a hassle, or \u201ccorrupting\u201d his daughter, etc. \u2014 and go back to the home country where she is even more at risk and has fewer rights. \n\nOP stay strong and please take your friends\u2019 mums up on their offer. What a nice community it sounds like you have, thank goodness.", "> My friend was married off at **12** to her **cousin** back home\n\ni'm not sure which part of this sentence is worse.", "Citizenship will take more time but I should have indefinite leave to remain soon. It is a bit like green cards in the US.", "He also forbids pads", "THIS is so important!  He could take OP back to their native country for a \u201cvisit\u201d when it\u2019s really for an arranged marriage.", "Tell him this is bizarre for the UK and that if your teqchers knew he might get a visit from child services", "There are uneducated religious groups that say things like a hymen can be broken by tampons there for not a virgin. You could've fallen off a jungle gym as a kid and \"broke\" it if you even had one to begin with. It has nothing to do with being sexually active. \n\nIt sounds like you're in charge of a lot of house hold stuff and traditionally feminine stuff. Could you sew a fake bottom to your back pack to keep a private stash for whatever from school? It could come in handy for snacks or whatever else. \n\nIf you can, try and talk to a counselor or whatever the UK equivalent is on how to create a support system so when youre an adult, you have a plan. it's unfair, but you're gonna have to plan more then your average student.", "At least they never tried to deport people they invited and encouraged to immigrate and gave express permission to remain because they lost/purposely destroyed records\u2026 Never mind.", "At least the Home Secretary never deliberately let asylum detention centres become dangerously overcrowded so that people would be treated degradingly, catch diphtheria & die\u2026 oh wait.
