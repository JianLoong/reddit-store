When my dad taught me how to handle my period we lived in a different country and he gave me a reusable pad, which is just some cloth and told me to wash them when they got dirty. He never got me pads or tampons and said that this was better.\n\nSome years back we moved to the UK and here my school has pads and tampons in the loo. Recently I decided to start taking some of them and taking extra to take home. I do not mind the reusable one my dad gave me but I find them less convenient as I have to wash them and they do not fit as well which has led to a few embarrassing incidents at school. Luckily though none of my classmates were ever mean about it.\n\nMy dad recently found the used tampons in the bin and he got angry with me then found the extra tampons and pads I stole from school in my room. He forbade me from taking them again and threw them out. I got upset since I am the one who does most of the chores like emptying the bins so he should not have seen it.\n\nI do not understand, my teachers specifically said we could take extra if we needed so I do not think it is stealing. In my other country I know girls use both cloth and pads and tampons but here in the UK everyone uses the disposable products. My dad also makes me eat after my brother and him when I am on my period even when I do the cooking and it bothers me as the other girls at school do not have to do this. He says this is respect for our culture and nothing about germs.\n\nEdit: I cannot do anything that will get my dad or family in trouble. We are not citizens here and I do not want issues for our visas. I want to leave home when I go to university and I am waiting for us to get indefinite leave to remain status. My dad expects to find a boy for me to marry from a nice family but I know he cannot force me to do that here, so I pretend like I will do that until I am an adult.", "created_utc": 1675710532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vf2xc/aita_for_stealing_tampons_and_pads_from_school/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having basic sanitary products is a bare minimum, and your dad is abusing you by not providing them and expecting you to use a cloth. Is there a teacher or another family member you trust who you could talk to about this? This needs outside intervention ASAP", "NTA and your dad is using \"culture\" as an excuse to be archaicly misogynistic. I'd hazard a guess that he has some dumb belief about chastity and tampons. \n\nDo you have any adult females in your life that could advocate for you to be able to have the hygiene products you need? \n\nI would also look into getting a silicone cup. If you can manage to get money to buy one, they last a long time, leak less than pads, and are a breeze to keep clean.

I don't even know what to say. This has made me very upset. You definitely need more than 1 reusable pad and as long as you are not cleaning out the entire stock every time, a couple of pads and/or tampons is not a big deal.

You're not stealing them, they're there to be used by the people who need them. Your dad is being controlling and potentially abusive-he can't have an opinion on which form of menstrual product is best because he doesn't menstruate. Different people prefer different methods, and he should be supportive of you finding the type of product you prefer, not forcing you to use reusable cloths if you're not comfortable with those. What happens if you're on a sleepover or a weekend away and can't conveniently clean it? You need to have a conversation about your biological needs and rights-you have a basic human right to access the equipment you need.

Ever think of trying a menstrual cup?  It's reusable so your Dad wouldn't find it in the trash.  Sounds like he might be snooping around though since you mentioned he found used products in the trash, but you're the one who usually empties it.  If you go the menstrual cup route, make sure to hide it well when you're not using it.  \n\nAlso, maybe a female teacher or counselor at school has some good advice.", "Oh, sweetie, of course, you are NTA. Your whole situation makes me incredibly sad with a father who disrespects you. Please keep getting those feminine products from your school and friends and hide the disposal of them better. You deserve a modicum of privacy and respect for what is core to a woman's hygiene. Hugs to you from an internet stranger.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t recommend a menstrual cup as it needs to be disinfected in boiling water and that might be an issue for you. In general make sure you are safe with whatever product you use.

You\u2019re not stealing - you\u2019re taking those products to use which is the reason they are there!\n There\u2019s cultural issues here, and your dignity is incompatible with a patriarchal religion.

However, you're getting a lot of advice in this post that might be challenging to follow.\n\nSometimes people with a Western background who haven't experienced other cultures (first-hand for extended periods of time) have certain opinions.

You _shouldn't_ have to, but things are often not ideal. You already know what you're doing, but here are some additional points to keep in mind.\n\nPlay along and be prepared to make an abrupt pivot as soon as you're legally clear. You do have to make appropriate preparations to move out:\n\n- Be prepared for a hell of an argument once you reveal your true intentions\n\n- Have access to your own passport and documents, and make a copy of everything for yourself\n- Are there any other personal possessions that you would never move out of the house without? If so, secure access to them\n- Be prepared to combat a claim that you can go to uni while living at home\n- Save money where you can\n- Take up a marketable hobby, if you can, that can earn some money on the side, or attain some skills that can get you hired quickly\n\nWhen the time comes, the intent is to introduce this as amicably as possible, but you have to be ready for if things go awry.", "No honey.

A big difference between tampon and disposable pads is that the tampon is inserted in your vagina while the pad is not. \n\nBased on what you said about your culture, I am guessing his disinclination about the tampons is that is has something to do with your virginity.

Could you try getting a note from a teacher you trust? Maybe if your dad sees that another adult is allowing you (in writing) to take products that you need, he\u2019ll be more lenient about it. That way, he won\u2019t get in trouble, but will also know that teachers are aware of the situation.", "1) The pads and tampons in the school are for you, take as many as you like. \n2) I understand your concern about your visa and I'm ashamed to say your right to be worried. This govt may make trouble for your dad and the rest of the family.  However, is there anyone in your community that can speak to your dad for you?\nThe alternative is to tell your dad that using reusable pads increases the likelihood of getting infections and will affect your future fertility. If he wants grandkids he needs to let you use disposables.", "You might have more luck asking for new/better cloth pads? And/or a menstrual cup. \n\nI use cloth pads, and they fit well enough that I don't have leak issues, and I'll bet you've grown since your dad bought them (which is another argument you can use).\n\nThis *should not* be happening, it *is not your fault* and you're *not* the asshole. But when you're fifteen and stuck with an abusive parent under threat of deportation (I know how awful the UK immigration lot are being right now) you've got to find the least worst option, and this might be it.", "That such BS to me!!! You should get to choose how you deal with your period! \n\nI would free bleed all over the place out of spite in this situation! \n\nOMG I'm so mad!!", "Not really sure I could be wrong here as never used the cup but would you be able to dip the cloth in the cup when take it out to make it seem like your using them even if not ? Or use cloths at home where it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if you leak ? Definitely NTA nothing worse than leaking in public", "Can your friends help you discretely acquire some period panties for the times you have to use the cloth to prevent any more embarrassing accidents? I doubt your dad would realize what the underwear are really for.", "Well you can use the cloth while at home, and use the pads and tampons while at school and other places at least", "Consider asking one of the adult women to have a chat with your father. Or maybe (sounds like he won't listen to women) ask a male teacher or something like that.", "What country in the U.K. are you in? Not being nosey but to have a look to so where else can help you", "He\u2019s an ass, and this is considered gender based child abuse in any reasonably civilized developed country. Have you tried getting your teacher/school nurse/doctor involved? They have a duty to report crap like this. Your father is in serious need of some education.", "Oh, I agree, dad sounds like a massive AH who wants control over women.", "I agree. Some men are so weird about tampons. And given what OP has said about her families cultural practices I suspect the father is opposed to tampons on 'purity' grounds. \n\nOP, I'm sorry your father is making your life so difficult. I think you could speak to a teacher/ councillor at school without it causing problems with your families immigration application. Tell the teacher that concerns you and you don't want it to go any further.", "If your school has a child protection officer or anything like that my advice would be to speak with them! Get all the help you can from school or any clubs you're in. \n\nYou didn't steal. You're NTA.", "This makes me so upset. It's not about what's best in *his* opinion. Since you're the one dealing with this monthly, it's about what's best for *you*. Are you able to work part-time at all? Just to be able to make enough money to buy them for yourself", "Sigh. I was hoping he was not familiar with them and that you would be able to just pass them off as regular underwear.", "Oh, do they work well for his monthlies? Glad he\u2019s got such first-hand experience to pass on to you. /s Traditions differ between countries, and it\u2019s reasonable to want to follow the norms in the UK which are more comfortable and convenient.", "That's annoying because they are not as I'm sure you've doscorverd and I'm guessing period pants aren't something he will buy either.\n\nAre there any females your dad respects who can tell. Him he's being an ass over this?", "Your local food bank may be able to help you as well. I\u2019m also in the U.K. and a food bank volunteer, and we always have period supplies on hand. Maybe suggest a small bin in your own bedroom where you can quietly dispose of your products before putting in the outside bin? I\u2019m so sorry OP, being a teenager girl is hard enough without this extra and completely unfair stress - hang in there, you\u2019ll be 18 soon enough.", "This makes it sound like he specifically wants you to use a cloth pad so that he can monitor your period, so that he can make you adhere to his kitchen rules.\n\nLet me say very clearly: no one is owed information about your body, not even your father. Nobody on earth. Monitoring your actions to sleuth out when you are on your period is a weird thing to do. Trust your instincts and keep using the school-provided hygiene stuff whenever possible, since you feel more comfortable with those.", "Lie, pretend to get your period every 6-7 weeks so you need to deal with it less often and it\u2019s easier to hide the pads and tampons.", "You say that, but technically he can\u2019t force you to wear his shitty traditional pads (short of physically putting them on you), but you\u2019re letting him bully you into that too.", "Could you keep a stash at school in your locker? Then before you come home, switch to the reusable ones?", "> I have a computer for school work and taught myself to code and I quite like it so that is my hobby \n\nThat's a really good hobby. I ended up building companies around it actually. \n\nGood luck with everything and stay positive.", "Not a waste of time if you posted this to the internet. The counselor wouldn\u2019t be focusing on your emotions but the resource issue. Emotions would come secondary to getting the supplies you need.", "I will think about it, my plan has been to just wait until I go to university and somehow escape and not live with him when I become an adult.", "From a **Male** teacher that is trusted, hopefully. Sounds like her dad has a rather chauvinistic attitude, a note from a woman would be treated as worth less than the paper it was written on.", "It will not work, I have discussed it a lot with him already, he will not even buy reusable products and wants me to use the traditional cloth.\n\nI have lots of people to help me like friends and one of my friends mum. She even said if we get in the same uni I could live with my friend for uni for free.", "He has refused to buy those as well, and says the traditional one is better, I tried to argue for it.", "If I'm right about the culture in question, I don't think that would end well for OP.", "Dipping the cloth into the cup would definitely work. Brilliant idea.", "Yes my friends and one of their mum's help me with anything I need.\n\nThat is what I do not, I even use them at home, but just hide them better and dispose them outside. Then I pretend I am using the cloth by washing it and putting it for drying.", "You do realize that this type of advice will just piss off her angry abusive dad and he'll ship her back off to the home country to get married and basically be a slave for the rest of her life.", "England", "Even in my home country people do not do this especially in the cities.", "I think they might be Indians... They culturally have weird hang ups around menstruation...\n\nLike, menstruating women aren't safe to be around... It's not just about tampons....", "I do not want him to get in trouble and cause issues for our immigration here.

I was thinking of asking my friend to get me a me a menstrual cup.", "Even in my home country many people use pads and tampons so I do not understand.", "I have no issues accessing and obtaining them from school and from my friends.\n\nI will just have to hide them and dispose them well and pretend that I am still using and washing the traditional cloth. He knows when I wash and put them for drying. \n\nI already have a bin but I think he might check that. I have secret places I can hide them though and I can dispose used ones at school.", "I have many options to hide them and dispose them without him knowing luckily. I just have to pretend to use and wash the cloth ones so he does not suspect.", "Honestly I'd go with the waiting it out plan - it makes the most sense. As you pointed out, you don't want anything to interfere with the Visa process. Your dad is being ridiculous, but if you can get the supplies you need and keep them well hidden, just do that. The food thing is awful as well, but as long as you're getting enough to eat I'd just keep my head down until you can graduate and move out. If your dad gets it into his head that you're rebellious and need to be sent back home it's going to be a much bigger problem.", "Note that stuff like \"my parents are worried about tampons, could you maybe provide them an explanation\" directed to a school nurse / doctor will not get your family in trouble. Same for \"my parents don't believe school provides us with free pads, could you write them a note? \".\n\nWhile sitting quiet is probably best, maybe something's Ng like this would be worth a try.", "But be caredul, you said he wants you to marry... Not that he already made plans with someone to marry you off the next chance... Some countries still allow underage marriages and have nothing against \"arranged\" (forced) marriages... Heard too often stories like yours that ended this way! Please, be really careful, dear!", "Can you set up a public Amazon wishlist at all? I'd be happy to buy you some supplies if needed, or even just a menstrual cup to try as that might be a decent alternative. Or some more reusable pads, as it sounds like you only have one.", "Ok see how long you can put up with him but at the end of the day you also need to make sure your safe. I mean you don't even need to use it just wash it at least once a month so he can see it hanging.\n\nIf he wants to see the dirty rag, then get out and get safe. Your dad sounds like his suffering from PTSD. A lot of asylum seekers suffer with this but very few are adequately supported.\n\nI think in the UK you can move out at 16, I'm not sure what support would be available.", "Apparently Morrisons did have a scheme but unsure if still running. You could ask if you have one nearby?", "You don\u2019t live there anymore. There are advantages to this. Keep the traditions with real meaning and value, toss out the rest.", "Yes I was thinking subcontinental. The OP mentioning the not being allowed to eat with the family during her period.", "I understand, I won't claim to know or understand your living situation but if you really feel you can't speak to protection officers etc. It would be great if you could still speak to some trusted teachers/ staff members/family friends who could give you the products you need. \nIt may be a case of using the products that make you most comfortable at school, sports, clubs etc. And then using the cloths he has provided at home when you aren't socialising and won't feel as insecure and uncomfortable. \n\nPlease remember you have done nothing wrong, there are people and services available to you and keep looking towards the future of university!! \n\nStay safe", "You are a child. It's on him to behave decently to be granted leave to remain, not on you to hide his misdeeds.\n\nSaid that, noone will kick you guys out over pads.

I would seek advice on whether if he has to go back, you can stay.", "I am so excited for you to turn 18 and get out from under his thumb. Fuck the patriarchy.", "It\u2019s a control thing. The older you get, the less he can force you to do what he wants, and he knows it. Additionally, you are in a more progressive and advanced country so he\u2019s trying to force you to the standards of the country you left as a way of maintaining tradition. Which sucks. He doesn\u2019t care about your comfort or what\u2019s best for you, this is his stupid little hill to die on.\n\nKeep working on your education and an exit plan because you know he\u2019s going to try to marry you off and get you pregnant before you realize you can live a much better life without him.", "Sounds like a plan! But it would be nice to also get yourself some emotional support if you can. Tbh UK schools aren't great at this but it's worth a shot. Hope you'll do ok x", "And start thinking of an exit plan. Dad sounds like the type to not allow his daughter a job so she's gonna have to get creative to earn and save some money. Maybe you could get some work as a babysitter but make it sound like you're just hanging out with other (female!) friends.", "I'd also go with the waiting out plan.   \n\n\nDo not attract attention, find a way to set money aside as soon as you can (see comments) and RUN as soon as you are over 18, have papers and can make it on your own.   \nMake precise financial plans so that you never have to return (they might send you back to \"your\" country and force to marry).   \nI don't know which culture you come from, but it seems similar to mine and there, you better not be caught or found again...  \n\n\nSo... study as much as you can, work as soon as you can, be as low profile as needed to get the papers, get money and escape from that life and culture which is clearly against women.   \nGoot luck to you <3", "I would tell someone - she is 15 and the father sounds like the type to arrange a marriage for her before she makes it to 18\u2026\u2026\u2026", "I suspect he is well aware that I am allowed to take them but for some reason does not want me to use them. He can afford to buy them and it is not an environment thing as he also refuses to buy the commercial reusable pads.", "My country does not and there is no way he could marry me against my will. Arranged marriages happen though but with the consent of everyone.\n\nThere is however dowry and other indirect advantages like favours from the boy's family. I think he believes he can get a good dowry and boy for me if it someone from my home country if I have UK citizenship by then, but I will refuse this.", "Yes my friends told me about this and also offered to buy me anything I need. I can still also take from the school, but I just need to hide them well and make my dad still think I am using the cloth and wash / dry them.", "I have no issues getting them for free from school and other places in the UK and I have friends who said they can help me, my best friend said her mum could buy me anything I need and I am grateful for that.", "I think the real fear is that the fathers abuse will drastically ramp up if they receive a warning. \n\nI work for a child protection service in admittedly not England. \n\nBut part of the consideration in how we treat abuse allegations is whether us showing up to try and educate/warn is going to make the parent retaliate against the child worse the second we leave. \n\nIf dad is already talking about OPs future as an arranged marriage being the only plan, I would worry that her \u201ccausing him problems\u201d might mean he\u2019ll arrange that marriage sooner, if it\u2019s legal in their country of origin.
