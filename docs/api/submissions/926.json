If she is, there is nothing you can do about it.  Some things to keep in mind - whether your mom wants another child or not, she is a high risk pregnancy at her age.   Unfortunately, miscarriages and fetus development problems are much more common at her age than they were when she had her last child.  I am not saying this to make you think that even if she is pregnant she might not carry it to term so I won\u2019t have another sibling.  I am saying it because if your mom is pregnant this might be a more difficult pregnancy and your mom will need your emotional and physical support in the short run.  But, even if your mom ends up pregnant and in a few months you have another sibling, you are not the only sibling old enough to help with a baby.  Even your youngest sibling is old enough to take up some of the slack taking care of the baby with your mom.   \n\nAnd most importantly remember this is a short term problem for you.  Your parents may welcome another child but you already have one foot out the door.  Support your parents through what may be a very challenging pregnancy, but don\u2019t lose sight of your plans and goals.  Siblings can be a lot of help caring for younger children, but they are always your parents responsibility, not yours.

A lot of people love to say that you don't have to help out at all because you don't owe anyone anything, but if that's the road you choose then nobody owes you anything either.", "hmm wie w\u00e4re es mit ner wg also das k\u00f6nnte billiger sein ( geh nachdem wo du wohnst nat\u00fcrlich ) ? und wegen Geld guck mal ob du Sch\u00fclerbaf\u00f6g in Anspruch nehmen kannst", "I was going to say N T A until I read this. You\u2019re 18. You can move out and refuse to help or you can stay rent free and help as an adult member of the household. It sounds like you want your parents to subsidize you without having to contribute to the household. I\u2019m sorry but YTA", "Is it your choice if your parents have another baby?", "You genuinely believe you did 40% of the childcare for the 8 year old?", "It is but if the woman is super healthy it should be fine. People are aging better these days. Shaming women for having kids late is shitty.", "I completely agree with you. My reproductive endocrinologist actually used the words \u201cby 35, you\u2019re a reproductive dinosaur\u201d I wrote that on Reddit once and got downvoted to oblivion. 35 and 47 year old women are not old women, but in the pregnancy world, it is", "My mom had my brother at 48(surprise!) and I agree that it is incredibly old to have a baby. I have not met anyone who had a baby later. She had a hospital who almost refused to take her on as a patient and pushed abortion because of the risks at her age. She was fine, and my brother is totally fine (he\u2019s 14 now), but the idea that it \u201cwasn\u2019t atypical a few generations ago\u201d cannot be right based on the reactions my family has received. It\u2019s very very atypical.", "Every body is different. Women shouldn\u2019t be shamed for having kids later in life.", "That\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s about, \u201cI feel like we are enough but they want another one\u201d. Children don\u2019t get to tell their parents when they\u2019ve had enough. \n\nYes, 18 year olds can just move out. Get a job, save and go rent a shared apartment. If the thought of that is too daunting, maybe helping her mother with a baby won\u2019t seem that hard.", "[deleted]", "No you don't. You usually make your Abi with 18 and then can go study and life in a dorm or WG or whatever.", "How do you know your siblings won\u2019t welcome the baby, and won\u2019t want to help?", "That doesn't mean you aren't an asshole.", "Well you\u2019re an adult and that\u2019s fine to have an opinion. But expressing that and blaming it on her health is an asshole move. But still you\u2019re an adult and you can move out if you don\u2019t want anything to do with the baby", "Wrong; they're both equal in the sense that neither exist at this point (OP is an adult).", "And even if the mom said \u201ctoo bad I\u2019m having another kid\u201d that\u2019s well within her right. They both can have valid opinions even if they\u2019re opposing views.", "That\u2019s a pretty valid concern depending on the mom\u2019s illness. The edit doesn\u2019t make it clear if that is her internalized thought or if she actually said this to her mom. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s the mom\u2019s choice.", "Mod Bot made her add it", "We are a brown family and even if i gave them 1 million they wouldn\u2019t take it.  Thats how they were raised and thats how they raised me and my siblings.", "I do help in the household i just cant help with another baby.", "It is not her child. She isn\u2019t required to help take care of it.", "Yes. I did quite a lot for my age. When he was born i was 10. of course we both grew up and he can do stuff alone now but then i did a lot.", "Who the heck cares if it was 40%, 52%, 22.3%, or 89\u066a? She's not the parent so it should have been zero percent. If a sick 49 year old woman wants to have a baby then she shouldn't be surprised if her current children aren't enthused. The Mom sounds pretty selfish. Can she have a many children as she wants? Sure. Should she? Probably not. By the time the new kid is this child's age, the Mom will be 67. Plus she's not physically well. So I doubt she'll be doing all the work and will lean on her older children like she did to OP with each successive kid.", "Okay! Good to know. \nI agree with your statement!", "That\u2019s a super rude thing to say", "And my re just said 36 wasn\u2019t even near too old  and not actually really even high risk. Your point or are you just being judgmental? If you single doctor said it does that make it the gospel?", "Not shaming at all, I think it's fine that she chose to have a baby now, but let's not say its not old to have a child when it really is. I think a wanted pregnancy is always a good thing!", "I still don't think she expects to have a say. no where in the post did it say she expected her mom to listen to her, take her opinion into account and not have the baby, all she expected to influence and \"have a say in\" was her involvement in taking care of the baby.", "Ich bin auf nem Berufskolleg und mache dann abi.  Ich kriege von meinem job nur 300. damit kann ich vielleicht ausziehen aber ich habe keine m\u00f6bel,Lebensmittel oder sonst was", "If my mom is pregnant i would help but i dont want to.

You don't have to be excited about it, but it's not your decision. YTA", "Did you not go to school? Because I don't see how you would do that much of the childcare if you were in school. Unless you took care of the nighttime routine, fed the baby, bathed him, etc. \n\nI'm not doubting that you helped a lot. But 40% sounds like an unrealistic number.", "When you are part of a family, you help each other out. Epically when that family is all living in the same house. Refusing to ever lift a finger to do anything for your family is a uniquely Reddit mindset.", "Translation please?", "Not brown, but I moved out at 18 to leave a cult. I could have stayed for financial support, but the cost of living by their rules was too high for me.", "Her mother will be 48 when the baby comes. Do you really think this pregnancy won't take such a toll on her body that she won't need the help after? Or that she won't need extra help when she's heavily pregnant and OP should be focusing on her final exams? \n\nOP helps with her siblings already, so there's a precedent here. It's not that far of a stretch to think she'll have to pitch in with the new one.", "You really think my mom would let a 10 year old bath a new born?", "Op is at college and has a job where they only make 300\u20ac  they said that if they were to move out they wouldn't be able to afford food and furniture", "Her mother will be 48, not 80. \n\nDid her mother say she needs help? OP is assuming a lot. And what she described in helping with her siblings really isn't a lot. It may seem like a lot to a teenager without real understanding of what raising children involves, but it really isn't much.\n\nRegardless of how much help her mother may need, it is not the teenager's decision if another child comes along.", "Well, either that or you're wrong/lying about how much you helped. It can't really be both.", "[deleted]", "Thanks!", "They're NOT ops fucking kids, she shouldn't have to help that much, certainly not enough to snow how hard it is to completely raise children. If mom can't do the work to raise the baby she shouldn't have one", "No, it's not her decision. But she can say she's not going to help with the baby, which is exactly what she did. And if her mom didn't count on OP for babysitting then she wouldn't have gotten that upset, she would have simply told her not to worry and focus on her studies. \n\n>And what she described in helping with her siblings really isn't a lot. It may seem like a lot to a teenager without real understanding of what raising children involves, but it really isn't much. \n\nActually it's definitely\t a lot for a teen going to school and trying to have a social life. I have younger sibling and I never had to look after them the same way OP looks after hers, especially the youngest.", "Why does it even matter what percent it was? Is there a magic percent that makes it OK question MA? You sound ridiculous. No child should be taking care of another child when that child has 2 damn parents that can do it. She wasn't an adult and what they did was called parentification.", "At the age pf 3 he started to sleep with me so i konda did the night routine. I was there when he threw up. \nI did give him food, took care of him when mom and dad were busy\u2026.", "Im not Talking about the new born stage but from 3 to now", "And no where did OP say Mom asked for help! She is assuming! It still isn't her decision if Mom has a baby. She is grown and can figure out how to support herself if it's such a problem to her that another child is coming.", "I'm the eldest of 6 with a gap of 15 years between me and the youngest. My mom works full time as teacher. We all help out with house chores and mind the baby from time to time. He goes to childcare on weekdays. I don't mind it and certainly don't remember specific social event that i cant attend because i have to attend to my baby brother.  \n\n\nWe all still able to focus on our studies, and have relatively normal social life. All 5 of us moved out of the house after high school to attend college/university.", "I didn't ask what the percentage was. I doubted the honesty of the answer.\n\nI don't think people should be parenting their siblings either. I also don't think children should tell their pregnant parents that they should not have more children. Refuse to help with the baby, for sure, but tell a woman that she shouldn't have a baby she's excited about? Nah, f that.", "That still doesn't sound like 40%.", "So then you didn\u2019t do 40% of the work. The first three years are when they are the most work.", "Op said she already helped raise the others so safe to assume she'd ask again. My response was to your statement that op doesn't help that much and that she has no idea how much work it is to raise children. Why should she when she doesn't have children?", "Re-read the post. The only thing it says she told the mother is that she wouldn't help with the baby.", "It does sound like they pushed a role onto her she didn't want. I'd even go so far as to say it sounds like parentification to a degree.\n\nIt's one thing to have your kids help out, it's another to have your oldest kid putting the younger ones to bed or looking after them when sick. There seems to be lot of info/context missing from the post so it's very hard to judge.\n\nThere's a 7 year age gap between my two kids and I wouldn't expect the older one to do most of the things this kid is doing, for example.", "You\u2019re crazy trying to justify your logic. What if OP felt like it was 40% ? They were 10!"]}
