If she is, there is nothing you can do about it.  Some things to keep in mind - whether your mom wants another child or not, she is a high risk pregnancy at her age.   Unfortunately, miscarriages and fetus development problems are much more common at her age than they were when she had her last child.  I am not saying this to make you think that even if she is pregnant she might not carry it to term so I won\u2019t have another sibling.  I am saying it because if your mom is pregnant this might be a more difficult pregnancy and your mom will need your emotional and physical support in the short run.  But, even if your mom ends up pregnant and in a few months you have another sibling, you are not the only sibling old enough to help with a baby.  Even your youngest sibling is old enough to take up some of the slack taking care of the baby with your mom.   \n\nAnd most importantly remember this is a short term problem for you.  Your parents may welcome another child but you already have one foot out the door.  Support your parents through what may be a very challenging pregnancy, but don\u2019t lose sight of your plans and goals.  Siblings can be a lot of help caring for younger children, but they are always your parents responsibility, not yours.

I'd move my ass outta the house so fast she couldn't even say, \"wait!\" so OP, you are NTA in any way, tell your mom she's overstepping her boundaries with asking you to care for her child and not thinking about her health, it's also probably taking a huge toll on your siblings as well, I'm sure they'd also rather have a mom than another sibling, just another mouth to feed and another thing they have to share their stuff with, NTA again", "If one was positive she\u2019s most likely pregnant and it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or think about it.

Do they have chores or is all of this landing on you.\n\nWhere you suck:  Op, yes you love your siblings, but ultimately you do not get a say in what your parents do or do not do.  They are adults, it is on them that all of this will happen.  And the reality is that until she goes and gets a check up from the doctor to verify the test, being that there are 2 home tests that say yes and no, it is hard to say.  Also there is one other option that you are not looking at, and could your mother being going through menopause?  It would give her symptoms of such, even where it messes with her own hormones to where it could indicate that she is, or there is another medical condition.  Your words were harsh and hurtful.\n\nWhere your parents suck:  While this may be something that they want, they have not considered the impact on the other children in the home.  And further, due to the lack of getting checked up, that is where your mother sucks, as she needs to find out what all is going on and fast.  She needs to know what all it is, if she is or is not, and if she is healthy enough for having a child.", "I'm sorry OP, NTA.
