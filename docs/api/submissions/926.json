If she is, there is nothing you can do about it.  Some things to keep in mind - whether your mom wants another child or not, she is a high risk pregnancy at her age.   Unfortunately, miscarriages and fetus development problems are much more common at her age than they were when she had her last child.  I am not saying this to make you think that even if she is pregnant she might not carry it to term so I won\u2019t have another sibling.  I am saying it because if your mom is pregnant this might be a more difficult pregnancy and your mom will need your emotional and physical support in the short run.  But, even if your mom ends up pregnant and in a few months you have another sibling, you are not the only sibling old enough to help with a baby.  Even your youngest sibling is old enough to take up some of the slack taking care of the baby with your mom.   \n\nAnd most importantly remember this is a short term problem for you.  Your parents may welcome another child but you already have one foot out the door.  Support your parents through what may be a very challenging pregnancy, but don\u2019t lose sight of your plans and goals.  Siblings can be a lot of help caring for younger children, but they are always your parents responsibility, not yours.
