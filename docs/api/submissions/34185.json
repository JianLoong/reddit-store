It started out because my stepmom started to have some concerns about our family she wanted addressed. Our last session before Christmas a few things were brought up and asked and I decided to be honest. I admitted that my dad had lied to my stepmom about me asking him if she would adopt me and be my mom. This happened when I was 7. The second thing is admitting I never wanted to be adopted and I wish I hadn't been adopted back then and if the choice were given to me today I would say no.\r\n\nI was asked some questions by the therapist, stuff we had discussed a little prior in a solo session, and I was truthful. That while I have love for my stepmom I do not love her the way a kid loves their mom or dad or how I love my mom. I also admitted that it would feel weird to me to live with her if dad were gone and I have other family members (paternal grandparents and maternal grandpa) who would be my choice. I admitted that I kept quiet because my dad basically told me what was happening and he made it clear he would not tolerate me hurting or disrespecting my stepmom by telling her I didn't want her. I also said it frustrated me sometimes to know the adoption isn't reversable because that's something I would do.\r\n\nMy stepmom was furious at my dad. She admitted she had been told by my dad that I went to him privately about wanting to be adopted and how much I loved her. She was also led to believe I didn't remember my mom at all and really felt nothing for her... I was 5 when my mom died so my memories are not great but I have some. She also talked about how dad told her that I was worried about being replaced when they had kids and she went out of her way to be extra attentive and loving because she hated that I felt that way. But I confirmed I had never felt that way. I admitted I felt kinda bad before she had kids because the kid she loves as her own and claims as her own didn't think of her as his mom and would never return that love back in the way she deserved. I admitted it was a relief when she had kids of her own.\n\nMy dad is furious at me because things have been tense and there were a lot of very high emotions all through Christmas. He told me I had destroyed the woman who adopted me and gave me all her love and care and I had destroyed his second marriage. He also said I destroyed it all for some fuzzy memories of my mom and it's not what she would have wanted. I asked him if he really knew that. Then he went off about my grandpa and said he had no right to tell me that my mom had been terrified of being replaced and that she probably wouldn't have wanted me to be adopted or call another woman mom. I told him it was the first time I heard about that (truth, grandpa never said shit to me about it). My dad told me so I just decided to shit all over my stepmom and his marriage for nothing.\r\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704198583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wobz1/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_about_my_dads_lies/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In therapy, honesty is key, especially in family therapy where dynamics can be complicated. You were asked questions and you answered them truthfully. It's not your fault that your honesty brought to light lies and misconceptions your dad had created.\n\nYour dad, on the other hand, seems to have been manipulating the situation for years, telling your stepmom things that weren't true. This is unfair to both you and your stepmom. It put you in a position where you felt like you couldn't express your true feelings, and it gave your stepmom a false understanding of your relationship.\n\nIt's understandable that your dad wanted to create a harmonious family environment, but fabricating stories and pressuring you to conform to those stories isn't the way to do it. His anger towards you for revealing the truth is misplaced. He's responsible for the lies and the expectations he set based on those lies.\n\nYour feelings about your stepmom and your late mother are valid. It's okay to have complex feelings about family relationships, especially in blended families and after the loss of a parent.

He set his wife's expectations up based on lies, and then when those lies didn't pan out, he sat by and watched her be emotionally wrecked and questioning what she had done and whether it was her fault- without. Saying. A. Word. Like he literally watched this woman torture herself for years for no reason other than he couldn't be arsed to tell her the truth and let himself be thought of in a bad light.

Your dad is definitely T A for lying to his wife and coercing you for years into letting his wife believe his lies.

I love my aunt and uncles. I can't imagine a life without them in it.\n\nI call both my dad's dad. I call them both dad to each other.

The extended family is a mega bonus. \ud83e\udd70\n\nThat said, the comfort you do have is you are without a doubt, your mother's son. And no paper or judge can change that. You sound still close to your maternal family, so your dad did not take that away from you. Your mom knows your hers and in turn you know she's yours. I know the law may say she's not, but I disregard lots of stupid laws. I turned 30 and don't believe in government anymore anyway! Haha!\n\nI hope you guys all just build on this truth from here. It may hurt, but just because it wasn't this dreamy ideal, you do still have some relationship, and hopefully a positive one. So I think that is important to keep in mind. You love each other. \n\nThere needs to be some foundational truth building on everyone's part, but it is not your, the child's, job to fix anything with your dad or step mom.
