Asked if she could see it plugged in to make sure it worked. Sees that it turns on & pumps cold air, takes it home.\n\nThat's the bit that everything hinges on.\n\nAll that matters in these sales is that you're honest and give them any relevant info you have. You told them quite clearly that it hadn't been plugged in for a year. That's a warning to anyone that you can't know for sure how well it works. She obviously thought about whether it worked as she requested to plug it in and check. She was satisfied that was all she needed to make a purchase. She chose to take a punt on a freezer that hadn't been used for a year. That's an informed gamble and she must have known it came with a risk.\n\nIf you knew something like it cut out now and then, or it had some other malfunction, then I'd say you should've been honest. So unless you're also hiding that from us...NTA.\n\nNice of you to offer some money back, but you absolutely weren't obligated to and it wouldn't have changed my answer if you hadn't.", "NTA. When you buy second hand you take the risk of having no warranty. You\u2019re not Philips, so why should you be responsible for something that is hers which is now broken.", "NTA... you take that risk when you buy things second hand.  You had no knowledge about any deficiencies.", "NTA! Aaarrgghh, stand your ground, mate! She bought it via FMP, not Best Buy. She tested it and took it. After that you are not responsible for what happens or doesn't happen. Giving a 50% good faith refund is plenty! You've done more than enough, NTA!", "Haha thank you, I try to be! I feel like a total dick for saying no but also, \ud83d\ude12\n\nI laughed super hard at selling it again \ud83d\ude02", "Lesson learned \ud83d\ude14", "I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s just going to dump it in my driveway, haha.", "This is my biggest hold up because she\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t fully test it before listing it or selling it to her. I was going off the knowledge that it worked previously and that, when plugged in, the light came on and cold air started circulating. It would have been smart too because obviously I would have avoided all this.", "The way I'd think about it is, if it didn't work, it had very little value. So if you refund half, you're still coming out ahead. You're not obligated to, and it's not exactly MEAN not to, but you might as well.", "So, I promise that I\u2019m not keeping anything from y\u2019all. I understand your skepticism and if I\u2019d left anything out, I\u2019d totally be the asshole, no question.\n\nThanks for your judgement & reasoning!", "Call the cops if she does and take lots of pictures of her while she is doing it.", "You already stated that she knew it hadn't been plugged in for a while, and it tested to her satisfaction once it was plugged in. It's on her to test it to her satisfaction, which she did, whether or not you tested it doesn't matter as long as you say you didn't test it. Unless you lied in order to sell it, you have no moral or legal responsibility to her.", ">So, I promise that I\u2019m not keeping anything from y\u2019all\n\nDidn't mean to imply you are. Just trying to make it clear how I view second hand sales like this.\n\nFwiw, I run a retail business, and there are people who will always try to blame you no matter how upfront you are or what you tell them. I have literally told a customer \"I really don't think that will suit you, you should get a different one\" only to have them ignore me and walk back in two days later to ask for a refund as if it's my fault. I obviously don't feel good taking people's money just to have them upset about it, but there's only so much I can do for an adult who won't listen.", "Sorry, it wasn\u2019t meant in a defensive way! \ud83d\ude42 Just clarifying that she has all the info that I do \ud83d\ude42\n\nThat sounds super frustrating \ud83d\ude48 It\u2019s been a few years since I was customer-facing and it seems I forgot why I left, haha."]}
