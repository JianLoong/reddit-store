The Library of Congress issues the paperwork, but all you need to prove your authorship is the date of your earliest files; (2) work gets stolen much more rarely than paranoid unpublished authors claim it was; (3) ideas float in the osmosis, and the same idea may occur to an unpublished author and \"quite notable people.\" The probability of multiple family members having had the same experience of having their work stolen by notable people is next to nil. The probability of unpublished authors claiming theft of their work to justify to themselves why they can't get published is fairly high, even though the main reason good work can't get published is the extreme dysfunction of the publishing industry rather than the authors' fault.
