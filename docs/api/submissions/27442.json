(A little hard to say for certain without knowing more about him) I think at the very least, a cooling off period would be smart. Then reach out to the aunt and see if she\u2019s willing to not say things like that. Also, at 15; the kid should be able to tell you how he feels about continuing visits. His opinion counts too", "NTA but have you heard the kid\u2019s opinion? I\u2019m sure after talking you both can decide if she can visit him while you chaperone or any other thing that works.", "Sorry Carl, you got it all wrong. \n\nI think you acted with remarkable restraint. She's not going to change, but you should get ready for the flying monkeys, and maybe a few legal threats. I would not let her see him unless supervised or in a group setting where her vitriol is muted.\n\nReading a book of his choosing is not going to make him gay (and you know that's her concern). Sci-fi and Fantasy are great mediums to explore contemporary dilemmas in an isolated setting. But hey, the stories are what carry us away and give us opportunities to experience other existences.\n\nNTA  Keep up the good work.", "NTA\n\n\"If she promises to change\"?? Like, if she promises to treat LGTBQIA+ individuals like people? Or if she agrees to be quiet about thinking sexual preference should determine human rights allocations? \n\nHomophobia isn't a required part of a child's education. Unless he says he really wants to see his aunt, he'll be fine without that nonsense in his life.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason your friend chose you over his sister to raise his son.  You found out first hand why.", "NTA. let the kid like things he likes, she has no right to tell him such hurting things. I would consider talking to her later when you both cool down a little and discussing her visits if she promises to behave but you should keep an eye on her anyways.", "I think we\u2019re all seeing why your friend left his son in your care. I think since he\u2019s 15 he\u2019s mature enough to discuss the pros and cons of future visits. You and he are a family now so make this a family decision. If he decides to continue the visits, I would monitor, supervise and intervene when needed.", "People like that don't change. NTA", "NTA - lots more hate where that came from. People like that don't change. Next time they'll just be sneaky about it. I would however ask the child what they want and take their wishes into consideration", "Damn, that aunt sounds like a real piece of work. You did the right thing by standing up for your godson and not letting her visit anymore. Don't even consider letting her back in if she's gonna be spewing hate like that. Your friend Carl needs to mind his own business.", "Hell no! NTA! You hit the nail on the head- this kids aunt is full of hate, and is trying to teach her nephew how to hate. Keep her away until the knifed is old enough to defend himself, or legal adult, whichever comes first.", "If she apologises and promises to never spew that hatred again... you know what'll happen?\n\nNext chance she gets, when you're not again, she'll just start up again.  bigots can change, but not quickly, not easily, and not often.  Don't expect the aunt to change, but do expect her to continue to spew abuse... but she'll be more careful about not getting caught doing so. \n\nNTA", "NTA, what if your godson is gay? Now he knows his aunt is not a safe person and you are. Even if she's allowed to visit again. But I think you did right and she shouldn't see him for a while. And not before a discussion about her values, or lack thereof.", "AHs --which the aunt is in so many ways -- don't change. You did the right thing.", "Sounds like Auntie lives in Florida and has been watching too much Fox Propaganda\n\nNTA and keep her away", "I'm not going to call you an AH for this, but I do think you overreacted by cutting her off completely.  I think you need to ask your godson for his input.  He is old enough to make the decision to see her or not.  It would also be worth your while to have the conversation with him about your thoughts on what she had to say.  I am very far from having the Mary Poppins, optimistic, people have good in them mindset, but  use your words and raise this child to be able to think and form opinions of his own.  You would be doing him better service than to try to protect him from every vile word coming from other people's mouths.", "INFO: Hmmm. I am a bit confused. You refer to yourself as his legal guardian. Not as his adoptive father or foster father or \u201cdad\u201d. So, either you are keeping this kid at arms length in which case your opinion doesn\u2019t matter, OR you are respecting his wishes by not assuming the role of dad in which case why the heck would you not take his lead here too?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
