We had a post on here yesterday from a guy who didn't want to adopt his 2 year old nephew after his brother's unfortunate death because he wouldn't be able to retire until his 50's. So no matter what lies ahead, I wish you all the best. \n\nThat said, I think this situation needs some professional help. It's incredibly difficult and I don't think your husband is handling it well, but I can hardly blame him. If an unknown person was suddenly in my house, disrupting my children's lives, I'd be reacting much the same way. \n\nGood luck to you, and I hope  you're able to find the kind of counseling your family needs to stabilize and get back on track.", "NAH. \n\nI am saying NAH because your husband isn't obligated to have your sister in the home and is uncomfortable. He is upset that his child is being displaced and it doesn't seem like there was much of a discussion or an agreement from him to take on your sister and well as your three children and certainly he did not agree to change around the bedrooms like that. \n\nIt's not that you are the AH either. You both just fail to communicate or come to agreements. And you ended an argument with a threat to take your mutual children out of their home if he doesn't agree with you (which leans towards you becoming an AH). \n\nYou need a professional. You also need to come up with some ground rules, household rules and a living situation that benefits everyone. A two year old should not be in a loft area. If need be, temporarily put her in the master with the two of you. And then look at putting the 12 year old into the loft with a divider or a pocket door.", "NAH. I think you've done well for both your sister and your daughter, and I think this shows what an amazing person you are.\n\nI don't blame your husband though for having a hard time adjusting. I think his fixation on getting your daughter back in her room is his wanting normalcy. In the blink of an eye, he's suddenly responsible for the physical and emotional wellbeing of a traumatized tween who is older than his own kids, so he hasn't had the chance to grow in his parenting with the child's age. That's legitimately hard without the trauma. Unsurprisingly, your sister's trauma is manifesting in her behavior, and your home - your husband's safe space - doesn't feel like his sanctuary right now. Getting your daughter back in her room both feels like a small step toward getting his old life back, and is something he feels he can control in a situation that feels very much out of control.\n\nI don't know that going to AITA is the healthiest thing for your marriage right now. There's no \"this is right and that is wrong\" in your situation, just a bunch of very overwhelmed people trying to get through no doubt one of the hardest times in their life. I echo the recommendations to get to counseling as fast as you can, because even the healthiest relationships would be under strain right now.\n\nAgain, you guys are amazing for doing this for your sister, and I'm sending whatever good energy I have your way.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Maybe your husband needs to hear from a licensed professional, what is best for *both* your daughter and half-sister in regard to cohabitating.", "NTA. \nThis is purely unsolicited advice, but get your sister into therapy asap. Please be patient with her. Kids in fc have already dealt with so much. I don\u2019t know the specifics, and I don\u2019t know how many times she\u2019s been in fc but that doesn\u2019t mean her entire 12 years of life prior hasn\u2019t been traumatic. Also educated yourself on reactive attachment disorder. And maybe some family counseling for all of you during this transition. Your husband needs to understand what she\u2019s been through.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is two and you did a good job making the loft a comfy space for her. As a foster mom, I commend you for taking in your little sister. This is such a hard time for her and it will absolutely create a lot more trauma for her if she is moved to another new home. \n\nIs she in therapy? \n\nI\u2019m super tired right now, but will try to remember to comment in the morning with some tips for you.", "Info: \nWhy didn't you put your sister in the loft with a divider?", "YTA for making the unilateral decision after your husband had reservations and then threatening to take the kids and leave him if he crosses you.", "NTA, and you\u2019re a really good sister OP. Not many people would take on this challenge, but it will drastically impact her life, and for the better! Foster care is often really unsafe, especially for older kids and especially for girls.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy parenting/helping out a new kiddo, I hope your husband can come around to it", "NTA. It's been three weeks, your husband's expectation that your sister be able to immediately adjust without behavioural challenges in less than a month is unreasonable and unkind. His insistence that a two-year-old needs to be in a specific room of the home more than a 12-year-old needs to be in a safe environment is ludicrous. \n\nThat said, it would do you good to sit down as adults with an informed third party like a counselor or a social worker and work to get the two of you on the same page if it's at all possible.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing what you can to keep your half sister out of foster care.   That's a very caring thing to do.   \n\nYou need to get your husband on board or you're going to have your family torn apart.    You need to find out why he is adamant that your daughter isn't being well served by her sleeping in the loft.   \n\nThere's more going on here than he's telling you and you may need couples counselling to get an unbiased third party to talk you two through this disagreement.", "YTA. This affects your whole family and it sounds like you made the decision a little lightly and without talking to your husband about it. Her presence and behavior will effect your kids. She essentially a stranger to everyone and you have small children. That makes me super uncomfortable. She sounds like she needs way more emotional and behavioral support than typical.", "NTA if only there were more people like you in this world. Good luck and family counseling is definitely needed here", "NTA.  It is understandable your sister will take time to adjust.  Not only are you strangers, but she's gone through something traumatic.

I hope your husband gets his attitude checked.", "I feel like there are multiple layers to this:\n\nYTA - Putting a two year old in a loft? Come on.\n\nNAH - Taking in your half-sister.\n\nYTA - Threatening to leave if your husband crosses you.\n\nINFO: Why can't the 2 year old sleep in your room? Why can't the older boys share the loft room?", "I'm going with NTA.  It's a super tough situation, but at this stage, the 12 yo needs time and space to process everything that's going on.  We don't know the extent of the trauma she's suffered, or what other factors are at play.\n\nIf your husband was originally on board with taking her, but is now wanting to back out because it's too hard, he's not going to win any parent of the year awards.  This poor child already expects the adults around her to let her down.  I just hope your husband has enough sense to keep his feelings between you and him.  However, if you just moved all the rooms around without any discussion with him, that's going into arsehole territory.  It is his home too, and, while he's currently being unreasonable about things, it might be that he feels like his life is falling out of his control.  You might need to seriously consider if your marriage is worth sacrificing for the sake of your half-sister if a compromise can't be reached.\n\nYour daughter is 2.  She doesn't care about having her own room.  It sounds like the loft is perfectly acceptable as a place for her to sleep and spend time.  But you need to communicate with your husband.  If his attitude is a deal breaker, bring it up now.  This is all new for him, too, and is probably very overwhelming.  That said, he's an adult.  Your half sister is 12.  Time for some serious conversations.  Best of luck.", "YTA. This is something that affects your whole family. Not just you. You\u2019re making changes to everyone\u2019s lives but did you actually make sure that all of them were on board with this before bringing your sister in? Judging by your husband\u2019s reaction that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. You\u2019re threatening to leave your husband over someone who is essentially a stranger. You do realise this whole thing affects him as well right. Your intentions are sweet but your priorities should lie with your husband and your kids", "NTA. If she was closer in age to your sister I could see the logic of having them share rooms but I feel like this works for now also I don't know why but I just find the idea of her in the loft adorable plus it's easier for you to keep an eye on her while she's playing or napping.", "You need to contact her social worker because she needs therapy for trauma and it takes weeks to get an appointment set. You're not the first person going through this so don't feel like you have to reinvent the wheel. Contact the school counselor.\n\nIf she was in foster care she's in the system. Contact her worker..", "NAH - you are not the asshole for moving your 2 year old, she doesn\u2019t need privacy yet but she does need a space to play and keep her things.\nI have a feeling the issue your husband has is more about protecting your children. What I\u2019ve heard is that if you have bio and foster children you should have older bio children with younger foster kids to protect your bio children from being influenced by the foster kids. \nI can definitely see why you feel the need to be there for your sister but. Protecting your children should come first. \nIf you do choose to place her in other care please stipulate that you need to maintain visitation (ideally weekly or more frequent) she needs you in her life but this might not be the right time for your family for her to live with you.", "NTA- you went above and beyond to put both of the kids first! Your daughter is happy with her newly fixed-up loft space ( and is really young- perfect solution).\n\nYour half-sister is starting to settle in and likely start trusting you and her foster family more. It was very kind of you to think of her pre-teen needs and a likely want/need for space after the trauma she\u2019s been through. \n\nBoth girls have their own space\u2026 both have what they need\u2026 you didn\u2019t choose one over the other- you chose family, period. You sound like a lovely mom/sister!", "ESH\n\nOP should've talked to husband and daughter and entire family about half sister and instead of the eating husband by taking away kids, address the problem, you decided on something that changes everything without husbands opinion at all. What happens if he does decide to call the CPS or maybe he doesn't and chooses not to help raise the sis? You are willing to take all the whole financial and emotional burden. Your husband is concerned just talk with his and every party involved together.", "YTA. Not because you put your daughter in a loft, or because you wanted to help your half sibling but because you prioritized, essentially a stranger over your husband's clear reticence over bring this child into the home. That kind of decision has to be mutual w/o threats and ultimatums. When you don't start on the same page with something as major as this, things can't help but go downhill fast. Now you're threatening to leave with your kids. How do you envision that going? Either he reluctantly gives in again, but harbors resentment or you part ways and then you only have your bio kids part time.  Are either of those situations ok? You should have been more understanding to your husband's very valid concerns. You guys should have been honest with the social worker about those concerns. Maybe she could have gone to a foster home while incorporating visits, family therapy etc to build some kind of relationship with  you all with the goal of her moving with you once everyone was in the same page. I think your intentions are admirable, but how you handled things with your hubby is awful.", "Wow. Lots of things here. Sounds like your husband is looking for excuses as to why your sister shouldn't be with you. You need to have a mediated conversation about why. Is it the financial responsibility? Is it that he sees it as resources being taken from his biokids? Is it a fear of not being able to help her? The thing is, this needs to be sorted asap because the 12 year old is going to be more damaged the longer there's a disagreement about her being there. She's already traumatised. Please make sure that she has a counsellor to talk to. Your daughter won't care about being in the loft, this is wholly your husband's issue. NAH", "NAH.   You and your sister need to talk.   Get her a counselor, to help her transition.  Let her know the room by herself is temporary, for safety reasons.  If there was a fire, they don't look for kids in lofts.   Set a time limit so she can get to know you all.  \n\nNext, talk to your husband. Apologize.   Tell him you recognize the need for your daughter to be in a room, but you also want your daughter safe there.   This will take a little time.   Give him a timeline.\n\nGet some couple counseling.   This was a BIG unplanned change.   Your sister is a child who is hurt. She needs to know you won't send her away.   Your husband needs to be on board.", "Oh dear. You should have let her go to a foster family where she could have been looked after by experienced carers who know how to deal with the normal challenging behaviour that kids who\u2019ve been removed from their family will show. Her behaviour is likely to continue and probably get worse. Given the ages of your children I\u2019d say this is a safeguarding issue and she should be moved out for the protection of your children. The social workers should have warned you that this was the likely outcome. They\u2019re the AH.", "I understand you are in a difficult situation with social services but putting your 2 year old child in a loft is absurd there's no way in hell I would of put my baby in a loft to sleep", "YTA\n\nAt first, there were no ah because everyone was trying to do what they felt was best. Your husband isn\u2019t wrong for wanting to prioritize his children in their home. And it probably isn\u2019t a good idea to leave a 2 yo unattended in a living room. You are just trying to help a young girl/half sister not go into the system. You became the ah by exclusively making decisions that need to be a family conversation. You pushed it further by saying you\u2019d take the kids away if you didn\u2019t get your way. That\u2019s really messed up. It\u2019s nice you want to help, but you are willing to break up your family and you didn\u2019t even know this girl. If the situation is working or not working, you need to discuss what happens next, both short and long term. If it\u2019s important that you help her, maybe you should move out and find a place for you and her, and leave the kids and home to your husband.", "NTA, because you've been making judgment calls on the fly with admirable intentions. But you will be an AH if you keep making unilateral decisions and giving your husband ultimatums. The two of you need to reach a consensus, and he needs to believe that he and your children are still your highest priority. You moving your daughter to the loft made him doubt that. Your sister acting up and destroying things didn't help.\n\nThat said, your sister is undoubtedly traumatized and will need time and consistency in order to adapt to living with you. Your husband insisting on changes, or talking where she can hear about sending her back to foster care, will do significant damage. He needs to chill out ASAP.\n\nHe is in on the edge of being a major AH.", "Her husband needs some serious education on trauma and how it affects our brains and bodies. And I would also suggest a Nurtured Heart Training.\n\nOp - NTA. Get your husband some education and make sure your sister is seeing a therapist. I work with kids in treatment foster care. What you are doing for her is wonderful. But you may need to look into bigger houses as your daughter gets older.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I stand by my NTA though.", "So it's ok to stick your daughter somewhere that isn't a bedroom, but not your sister..   right.. good to know where your priorities will lie as your daughter gets older..", "Ok, NTA. I don't understand why he's so against having one of his kids in the loft, as long as it's safe there\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f There was enough of a discussion and you made sure the kids were happy, so I see no problem.\n\nI do want to add though that your husband's concerns are also valid. I hope he sees that your sister is starting to adjust to this new living arrangement and gives her a chance.", "You solved a problem that works for the people it affects.\n\nYou need to find out what\u2019s going on in the mind of your husband. He signed up for better or worse, but doesn\u2019t seem to be able to work with you on this.", "INFO: \u201cHe eventually agreed but said if it wasn\u2019t working we\u2019d put her in a foster home\u201d Was this a mutual decision? Sorry if I\u2019m misinterpreting but it\u2019s contradictory to your initial stance", "You have a traumatised 12 year old showing behaviours that can easily influence your young children. Do you really want her to influence your young children?", "She's fine in the loft. She doesn't need to move into our room.", "She has to be in an actual bedroom with 4 walls and a door. The loft doesn't meet those requirements.", "We're hoping the 1.5 hours per week with the psychologist will help her behavior. She's already starting to improve.", "Can they do something like put a babygate on the half wall off the loft and the \u201centrance\u201d. Like a giant crib?", "Agreed but I can\u2019t blame them, that\u2019s a very tricky circumstance on short notice. Leaning to NAH with a recommendation for family counseling. I may be wrong but it seems bigger than anyone being an AH", "The requirements for her to be in an \"actual bedroom\" are conditions of the foster system, it's got nothing to do with the OP's priorities.", "It's NOT safe there for a 2 year old. It's a loft space with a short wall she could find a way to crawl up to, and a completely open wall. I don't blame the husband for being against this at all.", "I'm willing to let her go if we actually try and it's not working for any of us. The first two weeks were rough for everyone but she got support and is improving.", "The kids haven't been exposed to her outbursts much (usually happens at night after they go to bed). Keeping her in her own room away from the other kids is the best way to keep them from being influenced by her.", "Her father disagrees. The two of you need a plan. This was a suggestion to getting a plan. At the rate this is going he will leave with the kids. You need to communicate. He is upset for a multitude of reasons ending with the ultimatum you leveled.", "That makes sense. Overall, I just want to say that what you are doing for your sister is amazing but this - Reddit - may really not be the best place to ask for advice for such serious situation. There are kids not much older than your sister commenting on things they know nothing about. You may want to take this to a more specific adult sub or maybe try a local support group.", "How is it okay for you to put a toddler in a room that a 12 year old can't be in? I don't understand CPS logic there.", "So your solution is to put your daughter in a situation that CPS wouldn't find acceptable for your sister?  No wonder your husband is upset with you.  I hope there isn't anything light enough in that loft for your daughter to push next to the half wall that she could then climb on to get over it.  ESH", "But you shouldn't be sticking your own daughter in an area that is not acceptable as per the foster system.  My parents did foster care and we shared bedrooms until they built an extension on the house. None of us got stuck somewhere that isn't a bedroom and doesn't even have walls surrounding the whole area.  No wonder the husband isn't happy!", "Gotcha. The support you\u2019re providing her is life changing and the fact there\u2019s improvement is wonderful. It\u2019s such a tricky situation but for the most part it sounds like you\u2019re handing it with a great approach and attitude. While your husband understandably has concerns, this is no doubt easy for you as well. \n\nFamily counseling could help make some of the logistics easier, giving everyone a more comfortable foundation to work from. Trust your instincts, wishing you the best of luck. NAH.", "They will at some point and obviously she\u2019s already showing behaviours that are worrying. Your husband is more worried about her being in the home than the 2 year old being moved", "Exactly! OP is making all the decisions without any discussion, and then puts ultimatums. She\u2019s not the AH for taking her sister in, but she\u2019s the AH for thinking this is only her decision.", "Great advice", "CPS didn\u2019t place the toddler just the twelve year old, therefore OP only has to prove the 12 year old has a room, not her other kids. I believe age also has something to do with that but don\u2019t remember how old you the kid has to be when you have to provide their own room whee when fostering.", "My local CPS won\u2019t place kids where they don\u2019t have built-in closets in their room- dressers are not acceptable.\n\nA closet is more important than a safe home.\n\nCPS logic doesn\u2019t always make sense.  Maybe let\u2019s not use them as the bar for a good home life.", "She's been improving. Maybe those worrying behaviors will stop. I really don't think she's a danger to anyone in the house."]}
