We had a post on here yesterday from a guy who didn't want to adopt his 2 year old nephew after his brother's unfortunate death because he wouldn't be able to retire until his 50's. So no matter what lies ahead, I wish you all the best. \n\nThat said, I think this situation needs some professional help. It's incredibly difficult and I don't think your husband is handling it well, but I can hardly blame him. If an unknown person was suddenly in my house, disrupting my children's lives, I'd be reacting much the same way. \n\nGood luck to you, and I hope  you're able to find the kind of counseling your family needs to stabilize and get back on track.", "NAH. \n\nI am saying NAH because your husband isn't obligated to have your sister in the home and is uncomfortable. He is upset that his child is being displaced and it doesn't seem like there was much of a discussion or an agreement from him to take on your sister and well as your three children and certainly he did not agree to change around the bedrooms like that. \n\nIt's not that you are the AH either. You both just fail to communicate or come to agreements. And you ended an argument with a threat to take your mutual children out of their home if he doesn't agree with you (which leans towards you becoming an AH). \n\nYou need a professional. You also need to come up with some ground rules, household rules and a living situation that benefits everyone. A two year old should not be in a loft area. If need be, temporarily put her in the master with the two of you. And then look at putting the 12 year old into the loft with a divider or a pocket door.", "NAH. I think you've done well for both your sister and your daughter, and I think this shows what an amazing person you are.\n\nI don't blame your husband though for having a hard time adjusting. I think his fixation on getting your daughter back in her room is his wanting normalcy. In the blink of an eye, he's suddenly responsible for the physical and emotional wellbeing of a traumatized tween who is older than his own kids, so he hasn't had the chance to grow in his parenting with the child's age. That's legitimately hard without the trauma. Unsurprisingly, your sister's trauma is manifesting in her behavior, and your home - your husband's safe space - doesn't feel like his sanctuary right now. Getting your daughter back in her room both feels like a small step toward getting his old life back, and is something he feels he can control in a situation that feels very much out of control.\n\nI don't know that going to AITA is the healthiest thing for your marriage right now. There's no \"this is right and that is wrong\" in your situation, just a bunch of very overwhelmed people trying to get through no doubt one of the hardest times in their life. I echo the recommendations to get to counseling as fast as you can, because even the healthiest relationships would be under strain right now.\n\nAgain, you guys are amazing for doing this for your sister, and I'm sending whatever good energy I have your way.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Please be patient with her. Kids in fc have already dealt with so much. I don\u2019t know the specifics, and I don\u2019t know how many times she\u2019s been in fc but that doesn\u2019t mean her entire 12 years of life prior hasn\u2019t been traumatic. Also educated yourself on reactive attachment disorder. And maybe some family counseling for all of you during this transition. Your husband needs to understand what she\u2019s been through.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is two and you did a good job making the loft a comfy space for her. As a foster mom, I commend you for taking in your little sister. This is such a hard time for her and it will absolutely create a lot more trauma for her if she is moved to another new home. \n\nIs she in therapy? \n\nI\u2019m super tired right now, but will try to remember to comment in the morning with some tips for you.", "Info: \nWhy didn't you put your sister in the loft with a divider?", "YTA for making the unilateral decision after your husband had reservations and then threatening to take the kids and leave him if he crosses you.", "NTA, and you\u2019re a really good sister OP. Not many people would take on this challenge, but it will drastically impact her life, and for the better! Foster care is often really unsafe, especially for older kids and especially for girls.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy parenting/helping out a new kiddo, I hope your husband can come around to it", "NTA. It's been three weeks, your husband's expectation that your sister be able to immediately adjust without behavioural challenges in less than a month is unreasonable and unkind. His insistence that a two-year-old needs to be in a specific room of the home more than a 12-year-old needs to be in a safe environment is ludicrous. \n\nThat said, it would do you good to sit down as adults with an informed third party like a counselor or a social worker and work to get the two of you on the same page if it's at all possible.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing what you can to keep your half sister out of foster care.   That's a very caring thing to do.   \n\nYou need to get your husband on board or you're going to have your family torn apart.    You need to find out why he is adamant that your daughter isn't being well served by her sleeping in the loft.   \n\nThere's more going on here than he's telling you and you may need couples counselling to get an unbiased third party to talk you two through this disagreement.", "YTA. This affects your whole family and it sounds like you made the decision a little lightly and without talking to your husband about it. Her presence and behavior will effect your kids. She essentially a stranger to everyone and you have small children. That makes me super uncomfortable. She sounds like she needs way more emotional and behavioral support than typical.", "NTA if only there were more people like you in this world. Good luck and family counseling is definitely needed here", "NTA.  It is understandable your sister will take time to adjust.  Not only are you strangers, but she's gone through something traumatic.  He needs to learn some compassion. \n\nCould your sister take the loft?", "INFO: What reason, if any, has your husband given for insisting to put your daughter back in her old room?\nAlso, did you discuss with your husband where you were going to put your half sister before she came to stay with you guys?

I doubt she cares and if she does, nothing some ice cream can\u2019t remedy :)\n\nIn all seriousness, you\u2019re doing an incredibly important thing for your half sister and providing a wonderful lesson to your children.  I hope your husband gets his attitude checked.", "I feel like there are multiple layers to this:\n\nYTA - Putting a two year old in a loft? Come on.\n\nNAH - Taking in your half-sister.\n\nYTA - Threatening to leave if your husband crosses you.\n\nINFO: Why can't the 2 year old sleep in your room? Why can't the older boys share the loft room?", "I'm going with NTA.  It's a super tough situation, but at this stage, the 12 yo needs time and space to process everything that's going on.  We don't know the extent of the trauma she's suffered, or what other factors are at play.\n\nIf your husband was originally on board with taking her, but is now wanting to back out because it's too hard, he's not going to win any parent of the year awards.  This poor child already expects the adults around her to let her down.  I just hope your husband has enough sense to keep his feelings between you and him.  However, if you just moved all the rooms around without any discussion with him, that's going into arsehole territory.  It is his home too, and, while he's currently being unreasonable about things, it might be that he feels like his life is falling out of his control.  You might need to seriously consider if your marriage is worth sacrificing for the sake of your half-sister if a compromise can't be reached.\n\nYour daughter is 2.  She doesn't care about having her own room.  It sounds like the loft is perfectly acceptable as a place for her to sleep and spend time.  But you need to communicate with your husband.  If his attitude is a deal breaker, bring it up now.  This is all new for him, too, and is probably very overwhelming.  That said, he's an adult.  Your half sister is 12.  Time for some serious conversations.  Best of luck.", "YTA. This is something that affects your whole family. Not just you. You\u2019re making changes to everyone\u2019s lives but did you actually make sure that all of them were on board with this before bringing your sister in? Judging by your husband\u2019s reaction that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. You\u2019re threatening to leave your husband over someone who is essentially a stranger. You do realise this whole thing affects him as well right. Your intentions are sweet but your priorities should lie with your husband and your kids", "NTA. If she was closer in age to your sister I could see the logic of having them share rooms but I feel like this works for now also I don't know why but I just find the idea of her in the loft adorable plus it's easier for you to keep an eye on her while she's playing or napping.", "You need to contact her social worker because she needs therapy for trauma and it takes weeks to get an appointment set. You're not the first person going through this so don't feel like you have to reinvent the wheel. Contact the school counselor.\n\nIf she was in foster care she's in the system. Contact her worker..", "NAH - you are not the asshole for moving your 2 year old, she doesn\u2019t need privacy yet but she does need a space to play and keep her things.\nI have a feeling the issue your husband has is more about protecting your children. What I\u2019ve heard is that if you have bio and foster children you should have older bio children with younger foster kids to protect your bio children from being influenced by the foster kids. \nI can definitely see why you feel the need to be there for your sister but. Protecting your children should come first. \nIf you do choose to place her in other care please stipulate that you need to maintain visitation (ideally weekly or more frequent) she needs you in her life but this might not be the right time for your family for her to live with you.", "NTA- you went above and beyond to put both of the kids first! Your daughter is happy with her newly fixed-up loft space ( and is really young- perfect solution).\n\nYour half-sister is starting to settle in and likely start trusting you and her foster family more. It was very kind of you to think of her pre-teen needs and a likely want/need for space after the trauma she\u2019s been through. \n\nBoth girls have their own space\u2026 both have what they need\u2026 you didn\u2019t choose one over the other- you chose family, period. You sound like a lovely mom/sister!", "ESH\n\nOP should've talked to husband and daughter and entire family about half sister and instead of the eating husband by taking away kids, address the problem, you decided on something that changes everything without husbands opinion at all. What happens if he does decide to call the CPS or maybe he doesn't and chooses not to help raise the sis? You are willing to take all the whole financial and emotional burden. Your husband is concerned just talk with his and every party involved together.", "YTA. Not because you put your daughter in a loft, or because you wanted to help your half sibling but because you prioritized, essentially a stranger over your husband's clear reticence over bring this child into the home. That kind of decision has to be mutual w/o threats and ultimatums. When you don't start on the same page with something as major as this, things can't help but go downhill fast. Now you're threatening to leave with your kids. How do you envision that going? Either he reluctantly gives in again, but harbors resentment or you part ways and then you only have your bio kids part time.  Are either of those situations ok? You should have been more understanding to your husband's very valid concerns. You guys should have been honest with the social worker about those concerns. Maybe she could have gone to a foster home while incorporating visits, family therapy etc to build some kind of relationship with  you all with the goal of her moving with you once everyone was in the same page. I think your intentions are admirable, but how you handled things with your hubby is awful.", "Wow. Lots of things here. Sounds like your husband is looking for excuses as to why your sister shouldn't be with you. You need to have a mediated conversation about why. Is it the financial responsibility? Is it that he sees it as resources being taken from his biokids? Is it a fear of not being able to help her? The thing is, this needs to be sorted asap because the 12 year old is going to be more damaged the longer there's a disagreement about her being there. She's already traumatised. Please make sure that she has a counsellor to talk to. Your daughter won't care about being in the loft, this is wholly your husband's issue. NAH", "NAH.   You and your sister need to talk.   Get her a counselor, to help her transition.  Let her know the room by herself is temporary, for safety reasons.  If there was a fire, they don't look for kids in lofts.   Set a time limit so she can get to know you all.  \n\nNext, talk to your husband. Apologize.   Tell him you recognize the need for your daughter to be in a room, but you also want your daughter safe there.   This will take a little time.   Give him a timeline.\n\nGet some couple counseling.   This was a BIG unplanned change.   Your sister is a child who is hurt. She needs to know you won't send her away.   Your husband needs to be on board.", "Oh dear. You should have let her go to a foster family where she could have been looked after by experienced carers who know how to deal with the normal challenging behaviour that kids who\u2019ve been removed from their family will show. Her behaviour is likely to continue and probably get worse. Given the ages of your children I\u2019d say this is a safeguarding issue and she should be moved out for the protection of your children. The social workers should have warned you that this was the likely outcome. They\u2019re the AH.", "I understand you are in a difficult situation with social services but putting your 2 year old child in a loft is absurd there's no way in hell I would of put my baby in a loft to sleep", "YTA\n\nAt first, there were no ah because everyone was trying to do what they felt was best. Your husband isn\u2019t wrong for wanting to prioritize his children in their home. And it probably isn\u2019t a good idea to leave a 2 yo unattended in a living room. You are just trying to help a young girl/half sister not go into the system. You became the ah by exclusively making decisions that need to be a family conversation. You pushed it further by saying you\u2019d take the kids away if you didn\u2019t get your way. That\u2019s really messed up. It\u2019s nice you want to help, but you are willing to break up your family and you didn\u2019t even know this girl. If the situation is working or not working, you need to discuss what happens next, both short and long term. If it\u2019s important that you help her, maybe you should move out and find a place for you and her, and leave the kids and home to your husband.", "NTA, because you've been making judgment calls on the fly with admirable intentions. But you will be an AH if you keep making unilateral decisions and giving your husband ultimatums. The two of you need to reach a consensus, and he needs to believe that he and your children are still your highest priority. You moving your daughter to the loft made him doubt that. Your sister acting up and destroying things didn't help.\n\nThat said, your sister is undoubtedly traumatized and will need time and consistency in order to adapt to living with you. Your husband insisting on changes, or talking where she can hear about sending her back to foster care, will do significant damage. He needs to chill out ASAP.\n\nHe is in on the edge of being a major AH.", "Her husband needs some serious education on trauma and how it affects our brains and bodies. And I would also suggest a Nurtured Heart Training.\n\nOp - NTA. Get your husband some education and make sure your sister is seeing a therapist. I work with kids in treatment foster care. What you are doing for her is wonderful. But you may need to look into bigger houses as your daughter gets older.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While having your toddler in the loft area may work short-term, a more permanent solution is needed.  Also, your spouse\u2019s concerns absolutely need to be heard, validated, and discussed.

You have not enough space, as simply as it is. It was an emergency, so no big discussions and now the reality starts to settle. \n\nIts a little but much to ask on reddit, as nobody really can answer it. So I can just add some ideas which plopped up in my mind: \n\na) change the loft into a room (check before if its an issue with the static). Add a wall instead a ceiling and add some light openings (naturally with glas or whatever, there is no sense that everbody hears anything) - hope there are some existing window in the other 3 walls for fresh air.  Just an idea plopping up in my head. Move your sister in that room. \n\nb) Do not kill the relationship with your husband. You have 3 kids. All of you need to be onboard. Really onboard. If your husband is against it, but is giving up \"just for you\" doesnt mean he is accepting her as family. Means he will treat her differently. And kids realize a different treamtment. Even if he is trying to be fair, she may realize that for him she always will be a guest. So communicate and also hear him out , he seems so far the protector of the core family as you are the lawyer of your daughter. That will never work out, you need to find another way.  \n\nc) Accept that your sister is a stranger. You do not know her. You have no clue how her live was before. Also it means she does not know you. To build a solid plattform of trust takes long time. If you lose about this your other family it may make more sense for a (good) foster family and stay in touch regularly so she has a communication channel outside of the system. \n\nd) Look for another condo/house. Ask which financial support you can request. You anyway need more rooms in the furture.  \n\ne) Get in touch with social workers/CPS whatever,  to ask what family courses are available. A new family member is always a change (even with the own babies) and if you take a troubled Pre-teen without preparation - I cannnot imagine that there is not a support system somewhere on the official site. \n\nf) Hear your oldest boy out. He is no longer the oldest in the family and then the new sister is not just an older stranger but comes with a bunch of problems. So far you just talked about the girls. But also 6 years old listen in and have their own thoughts. Even the younger son is probably is getting some of the problems.  I do not think he and the younger brother are blind and deaf to the discussions you have with your husband. Ignoring them will lead to resentments in the future.", "Why isn't your sister in the loft?", "1st priority is to do no harm to your 3 children.  I'm not saying which path is right, but do not sacrifice them for her.\n\nInconvenience is ok, but not sacrifice.", "Reluctant YTA.\n\nI think you meant well, and if you had an established relationship with your sister, my judgement would probably be different. But you never met her before this. You didn\u2019t even know she existed. You are fundamentally a stranger to her, no different to going into the foster system. You\u2019re clearly untrained and inexperienced, and insisting on doing it your way is damaging everyone.\n\nA loft is not safe for a 2-year-old. There\u2019s the danger of falling, and if there\u2019s a fire you may not be able to get to her in time. Toddlers should be sleeping on the same floor as adults for exactly that reason. \n\nFostering a traumatised child is incredibly hard, and I say that as a foster parent, and one who came to it in an unconventional way, without the necessary training or experience. If you have a spouse or live-in partner, it *has* to be a mutual decision, not a unilateral one. I was able to decide on my own to take my kid, and to dedicate the majority of my time and energy to his needs, because I didn\u2019t have a partner or children. It was still incredibly hard. Trying to do so against the will of my partner, with three small children, would have been impossible without neglecting someone - probably everyone.\n\nI do generally agree that kids tend to better off being placed with family members, but that is assuming that a) those family members have the means (physical, emotional, mental, financial) to support another child; b) that the decision to take the child in is not being made unilaterally; and c) that there is some kind of pre-existing relationship between the child and the family member(s). You do not meet any of those three criteria. You do not have the physical means - ie enough room without displacing your daughter - and your husband is not willing, and you do not have a pre-existing relationship with your sister. If you met two, even *one*, I might think that she would be better off with you, but as things stand, she would do better in a place where there is room for her, where everyone wants her, and where they have some experience with traumatised kids.\n\nI understand how emotions, especially in an emergency, can cloud judgement. I think that\u2019s what happened here. Your emotions caused you to make an ill-thought out choice, which you are now compounding with threats of leaving your husband. Would you actually leave with the kids, or are you just saying that to get him to do what you want? Would you then try to take your sister into your new home on your own? How would you plan to raise four kids on your own, one of them a traumatised foster child?\n\nI have sympathy for you, and a great deal for your sister, but you *cannot* make a decision like this without everyone, or at least all the adults, on board. In trying to do what\u2019s best for your sister, and steamrolling over your husband\u2019s thoughts and feelings, you\u2019ve inadvertently made things worse for six people.", ">I have a half sister (12) that needed a place to stay. She was in an emergency foster home, and either my husband and I had to take her in or she had to go to a foster home. We've never met her. I didn't even know she existed, but I didn't want her to end up in foster care, so we took her in. \n\nHere are a lot of \"I\" statements in that paragraph that should be \"we\" statements. You moved a complete stranger into your condo. Your condo was already too small for the four people living there. You have 3 small children and now a preteen with some anger issues. You comment elsewhere that your husband wasn't 100% OK with the decision to take in your half-sister, but if it wasn't working, you'd reconsider fostering.\n\n>My husband wanted to put her back in her old room, but I didn't think that would be a good situation for either of the girls. I ended up moving her bed into the loft, and her clothes/changing table are in my room.\n\nYou didn't bother to run this by your husband either. More \"I\" statements. \n\n>To say my sister isn't adjusting well is an understatement. She's tried to run away twice, and she had a breakdown and destroyed everything in her room last week. . . . The past few days have been better. I haven't had to pick her up early from school at all this week, she's leaving her room for meals, and she's starting to talk to me.\"\n\nOver the past month, you've gone from running away and destroying the place to \"she's starting to talk to me.\" You commented elsewhere that the original plan was if the placement wasn't working out, then you'd reconsider a foster placement. \n\n> I told him if he sends her to a foster home after she's just starting to feel comfortable here, the kids and I are leaving. \n\nSo your the only person who gets to decide whether this is working out? Or are you just moving the goalposts AND threatening your husband that you'll break up your family. \n\nYou realize the problem here isn't the loft, right? You made a lot of decisions *on your own* that you and your partner need to be in 100% agreement on.

He worked long shifts and viewed all kid stuff as being my mum's business. Firstly that meant we couldn't have stayed with him because he wasn't there and secondly he didn't have the least idea what, for example, I would eat. So. She took the kids.\n\nNow when I had kids? I told my husband from day 1 we were approaching this as though the worst could happen. Whilst I still had the majority of childcare we turned down what would potentially have been greater financial reward so I could work part timw hours and he could have regular responsibility for them. He was in a job where if he'd needed to he could have arranged things to take the kids for as long as needed if he had to. He knew them and didn't get that panicky look a lot of guys get when left in charge of them. The one time he did protest he wasn't used to taking both put alone I took that as a signal to work on it.\n\n(Sadly he died three years ago.

That last one may be for things like this but may just as often be things like \"I have the job opportunity of a lifetime six hours away and spouse won't move\".\n\nIt can be sad. It can be awful. But no one is obliged to stay in a relationship they no longer wish to be I , with or without a marriage certificate, with or without kids.

A two year old is definitely not suitable for a loft space- the 12 year old is probably most safe up there, and then she would also have her own safe space to dissappear to. \n\nWtf was running through OPs head to put a toddler in a loft??!", "This! I can\u2019t believe how many people are overlooking the lack of safety.", "I don't think the half wall is even the worst part, there are 2.5 walls, one side has no wall at all!", "Toddlers should be in a secure place at night, not somewhere with part of a wall and a railing. What happens when she decides she likes climbing? My not even 2 year old can already fully pull himself onto the counter without using anything to climb up. This is dangerous. She's also threatening to take the children away because the father is concerned about his children. Their children should come first.", "I didn't say it was child abuse, so nice straw man argument.", "They\u2019re still talking about if it was reversed. Not that I think there would be a difference. Just clarifying their comment.", "I am not sure about anywhere else, but where I live, you aren't allowed to just move 6 hours away from your ex if it makes access to the kids a burden. You better find that great job opportunity closer to home.", "What I said is the only reason you should THREATEN to do so is in that case. But if they were really in that kind of predicament I doubt they would threaten. Instead they would just take the kid for there safety. This is necessary. I'm sorry that I am no word master but I think k you are reading what I initially said wrong, but yes I did word it a bit off, although it was directed towards this particular situation.", "Aside from the safety aspect (personally I think that a loft bedroom is fine for a two year old IF additional safety gear is installed asap), people are allowed to make all sorts of reasonable decisions about how to house their children that cps lays down rules against for foster children, because cps deals with unreasonable people all the time. It\u2019s perfectly fine to move your bio kid into the bonus room that is only not legally a bedroom because it doesn\u2019t have a closet, or to put a 13 and a 15 year old boy into the same room, both of which cps wouldn\u2019t allow for a foster kid because they\u2019re trying to stop foster parents from sticking them two to an unheated broom closet.", "OP said the daughter\u2019s toys were already in the loft. The husband had no problem letting a 2 year old play in the loft. The daughter has expressed no concern about losing her room. The husband is just pretending to be concerned about the loft as an excuse to get rid of the 12 year old. \n\nI agree with the people saying to put the boys up there, but the husband can stop being self righteous about the reason he wants the half sister gone.", "It's because of genders and privacy....it has nothing to do with safety", "Honestly the husband should just call CPS himself and report OP has endangered the 2 year old with the space arrangement. Then it does become a CPS matter. If OP is willing to endanger one of her own kids that would also likely have implications for fostering the sister as well.", "Apparently neither the mother nor the father of the child agree with you. I'm going with their judgement over someone who hasn't actually seen the area we're discussing.", "Yes, I understand that. But if CPS has regulations against it for foster kids, and the kid's father is against it, then *maybe* that should be reason enough to pause and reconsider.", "It's also different for different age groups. A 12 year old needs more privacy than a 2 year old that hasn't learned to wipe their own ass after pooping.", "She said in another comment that CPS has rules about the room the child uses. It has to be a room with a door. Fairly common for CPS. The rules are oddly specific in places.", "Why is the loft space bad for a 2 year old? It was their playroom before.", "The wall is 3.5~4ft tall,  not 2.5. 2.5 is the number of walls on the loft.", "Yet husband had no problem with his kid playing in that room, presumably without constant supervision.  If you are concerned about a loft half wall then you don't make that a playroom.  \nI'll say that this isn't a long-term solution and within a few months, as everyone settles in, OP should work on moving her daughter back in with her sister and maybe turn the partitioned portion of the loft into space for her sister to hang out after OP's daughter goes to bed.", "well fair on that one. he didnt get say in it. but she clearly values family and doesnt want to throw her in foster care again.\n\nsolutions can be found. make sure there isnt anything climb-able near it to help deter being enticed from the wall.\n\nher toys were already in there to begin with, so its not like shes rarely in there or not watched.\n\nmaybe shes(op) a little assholey for not giving him much say,  she is obviously determined, so is he. for fair reasons.\n\nthis kid may not be difficult forever. husband is obviously allowed to be frustrated, but there wasnt much time to decide and discuss. it was here and now. if he is so hard on not having her there, and op is adamant on keeping her, something has to give. neither have changed their minds in 3 weeks and it seems like they are both strong on the stance.\n\nshe is a stranger, but she doesnt have to be. a warning and better introductions to meet over time and decide would absolutely have been better, but thats not how it went.\n\nedited.", "Just the fact that the random child got priority over her own daughter lol. Crazy to me", "I was narrowly addressing the criticism about moving children's rooms around.", "Because you phrased it sarcastically. \ud83d\ude44", "That's interesting. I live in the UK where if you need government housing - say because you're a single parent who is dirt poor following the divorce - thry can say you need to move to wherever in the country they have some or go homeless, regardless of who that moves you away from. Rarely six hours (My country is not that big) but it can be a long way from anyone you know.", "The thing is there's a very thin line between threatening and stating, yeah?\n\nSay you've got someone whose marriage is collapsing. Their spouse works long shifts. They need to get out. So they say \"Look I'm going to go stay at my mums and take the kids with me.\"\n\nIs that a threat? Or is it just a practical plan? You could leave the kids but then spouse is going to have to take emergrncy leave which isn't going to help.", "A lot of people's issue is the safety of the toddler. It is not safe, toddler could easily climb and get really hurt. My not even 2 year old can climb onto a kitchen counter without using something to climb onto. There is toys on the loft that can be used as a step up as well. No toddler should be even playing on a loft without supervision, they're leaving her there overnight when they are sleeping! What happens if she wakes up?", "Before I became a foster parent the home study included all the bedrooms in the house and the sleeping situations for all kids (even my bio kids).  They also interviewed all members of my family (even the little ones) to make sure we were all in agreement about wanting foster children.  It might be different in an emergency placement and different depending on location, but if they actually want to keep this child long term, then they will probably need to make sure all kids have a suitable sleeping situation and that both parents get on the same page.   They need to consider getting a bigger house.\n\nThere is no way I'd let my toddler sleep in a loft - it only takes one time for the toddler to start climbing things  to have a very serious injury.", "Pretty high chance the toddler will too.", "True, but in this case it's a loft.... So the lack of the 4th wall is potentially a greater hazard for the 2 year old.  That's the concern in this case.", "I am sorry she may be your half sister but she is a stranger. You really don\u2019t know if she could be a danger. You do know your husband could lawyer up with the behaviors she is already shown, and the fact your daughter is living in a small attic may be enough for him to leave and take custody of his kids. And to be honest if there is really troubling behaviors he may be right. You have 3 kids under the age of 6", "2 years olds don\u2019t have a sense of how dangerous things are yet while being perfectly capable of pushing objects to that wall in an attempt to climb over it.", "Because I'm assuming they had some sort of supervision during play time. Also if nobody can hear the noise machine/see the lights from the loft I'm also assuming that they also can't hear the child. It's way safer putting in a 12 year old who can understand safety and if there was ever an emergency to get out the house its easier for a 12 year old to leave the room.", "No. Kids that age can push toys against a wall that high and climb over it.", "I disagree. A 12 year old does not want to share a room with a 2 year old. If this turns long-term, they can look at enclosing the entire loft and making it a room. A 2, 3, 4, or 5 year old isn\u2019t going to care about the room with no door. About 6, they begin to want privacy. But at this stage, there is no reason to think that the loft is not ok for the 2 year old. \n\nAnd threatening N to send the older child back into a foster system so his daughter can have her room back is a complete AH move. And if my spouse showed such lack of empathy, or compassion, towards someone like this, I would leave too. \n\nThe amount of emotional upheaval this 12 year old has gone through must be a lot. She should be in regular counseling. Husband should be too. The entire family should be, at this point. \n\nOP is NTA.", "What gets me is Cps would have told her the requirements for taking in her sister before they let her take the sister. So she knew the girl had to have an actual bedroom with a door. Right off the bat she was going to have her 2 yr old share a room with a complete stranger that even OP hadn't met. From the sounds of it, she did have them share the room for atleast a night maybe a couple. I get being family oriented, but to put a someone you didn't even know existed over your nuclear family is absurd.", "It can be bad for the child without being abuse. Children, yes even toddlers, need consistency and security in their lives wherever possible.", "Yeah...I am in Canada so maybe that is why there is that difference. Interesting though.", "Except your literally talking about the difference between a plan and a threat trying to sound nuanced and making yourself look foolish", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/HunterIllustrious846 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rh4ks/aita_for_moving_my_daughter_out_of_her_room_and/j6vvkc9/\n\nBot Reported.", "It depends what kind of loft. My old house had a loft on the same level as the bedrooms, with a 4 foot wall where the slope of the roof started up to the hallway. The missing wall was where the door to the room would be. The other side of the wall was just unfinished  storage space because the ceiling was too low for it to be living space. If it's something like that, there's really no more danger to a climbing toddler than there would be in a room with a 4 foot entertainment centre or an armoire.", "Like by, say, ensuring all their familiar belongings are around them and they have the night light/white noise they need to sleep comfortably?", "Ok so I'm asking you. What us the difference?", "Like by not kicking them out of their room so you can give it to a stranger.", "One is a threat and the other is to ensure the safety of the children"]}
