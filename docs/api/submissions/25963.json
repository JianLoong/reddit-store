IMO He should not have gone. \n\nNTA", "I think allow him to check on her was a mistake. She is using this to keep him in her life. He should of had her blocked so she couldn\u2019t have gotten in contact with him. I feel\nLike it will be another thing after this. She is having a hard time and needs him to lean on.", "NTA for your feelings.  \n\nIt sounds like it was her daughter, not his, so why is he prioritizing his affair partner's feelings over his wife's?   So he has feelings about the loss of his god daughter--well guess what?  His feelings come last after he is the one that decided to cheat and you graciously decided not to kick him to the curb.  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have forgiven him for the cheating so for me this would have been a non-issue--I don't share like that.", "NTA.\n\n\"Im not being supportive of his feelings.\" Wow, that is manipulative. \n\nLike, he cheats and is all upset you aren't OK with him going to be in proximity with his mistress?!", "I think it might be time for you to 1. get a lawyer and 2. a therapist to help you get through all of this. Your husband cannot be this woman\u2019s emotional support person if he\u2019s committed to your marriage. There is no other way around it. In order for your marriage to survive, he has to cut ties with this woman. The fact that he is not willing to do so means that you do not have a good marriage. It\u2019s sad that this woman lost her daughter, but it\u2019s not your husband\u2019s place to support her. And if your husband is sad about losing his goddaughter, he should turn to *you* not the AP to grieve.", "ESH.  He's a cheater, and you're staying with a cheater who keeps a relationship with his mistress (and complaining about it) instead of just walking away from this unfaithful man.", "NTA, Why is she calling a married man who she had an affair with for support/navigating grief. This would make anyone uncomfortable.. \u201c not being supportive of his feelings \u201c is comical. It takes a relationship a lot longer than a year to recover from infidelity, and how is he helping you at all by keeping in contact and being a support system to this woman he owes absolutely nothing to?", "NTA. Be careful though, grieving people often turn to s.e.x to deal with their pain. I think your husband\u2019s mistress invited her after service booty call and he jumped right on board. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear he cheated again, it was an emotional time after the funeral, you don\u2019t understand the pain and loss, you\u2019re being selfish, etc etc. RUN, GIRL RUN!", "Can I go and provide emotional support to the woman I put my dick in last year?? The fact that he\u2019s asking you is the worst. I\u2019d be peacing at this point. Single is better than this garbage!", "NTA - why you are accepting contact with those two is beyond me.  Yes she lost her daughter but she has to have better support then your husband.\n\nThe only way I would go is if I went. He wouldn\u2019t want that and she likely wouldn\u2019t but that would be my condition.", "Let him go to the funeral, and change the locks while he\u2019s there. He\u2019ll be fine. NTA", "It's only a matter of time before they suddenly have another affair due to their \"grief\"", "NTA. Absolutely not. This would be a hill to die on imo - he should not be in contact whatsoever with his former affair partner, and certainly shouldn\u2019t be attending the funeral to comfort her. Why are you still with this manipulative cheater who can\u2019t let his mistress go?", "NTA. While I am sorry for her lose, supporting her is the role of a friend or partner. By putting himself in a supporting role, he is putting himself back into a similar role as when he cheated on you.", "NTA and in situations like these all the support a man can ask for is about you not throwing his belongings on the street. You did not throw his belongings, you're morally ok.", "NTA. Why is she even able to contact him? \n\nIt\u2019s a terrible situation for the woman, but your husband cannot support her in this. Either he cuts all contact with her or you need to have consequences. People repairing relationships do not maintain contact with an affair partner.", "Oh my gosh you\u2019re a frickin Saint. This would be a hell no situation for me. Absolute bs. So you\u2019re supposed to sit home while these two cheating nimrods bond over their losses?? Yeah that affairs gonna start back up again. NTA for being so kind but damn girl this just ain\u2019t right.", "Ummm\u2026 No. And I\u2019d have left her to \u201cdo something stupid\u201d because obviously she is too useless to have her own husband and needs to call someone else\u2019s\u2026 She sounds stupid and useless and sorry about her child but why is she allowed to bother your husband?\n\nI\u2019d say no and if he went I\u2019d end things with him.

You are not being supportive of ***his feelings***?\n\nHow supportive of your feeling was he when he **had an affair?**  Were your feelings at the top of his mind when he was cheating on you?  Is he being supportive of your feelings by choosing to go be supportive of the other woman?\n\nI guess at least he told you that she contacted him. But if he's not willing to shut down any and all claims she makes on him, for whatever reason and in whatever form, then he forfeits any and all claims he has on you. Don't take this crap from him any more. \n\nNTA.", "Could it be his daughter? Did your husband and his mistress knew each other 20 years ago?", "Info: *WAS* the girl who died his goddaughter?", "NTA. \n\nCan you attend with him?  To support him and his sad reminder feelings of having lost a god daughter?  Or you know, for your peace of mind and to show the AP she is not manipulating anyone here.", "NTA. Geez this would be a deal breaker for me. Why do you even want to stay w him?", "Just let him go. Like sure go ahead but when you come back I\u2019m not going to be here. He cheated on you both emotionally and physically where he produced a full on child. He is by no means in deserving of your time or attention", "NTA", "NTA\nOP, you need to put your foot down and say \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d. I guarantee you he\u2019s still sleeping with her, so either you buckle down or buckle up to be mistreated again.", "NTA at all. Firstly, you haven't acted on your feelings, and your AITA question is basically asking if your feelings are wrong- nope, you are entitled to your feelings. Feelings are valid.\n\nI think you've been really compassionate in that you wanted your husband to provide initial telephone support to ensure her personal safety. Not many people would do that, which shows you are the better person in this situation.\n\nIt sounds to me like they both have unfinished business, considering he is her go-to for support rather than anyone else... and your husband jumps when summoned.\n\nUltimately, you need to do what is right for you because you deserve a life whereby you have love and loyalty. Your husband is without a doubt not a good person for you.", "NTA. Why is he even still in contact with this person? \n\nI don\u2019t have your patience, OP.", "NTA. He might console her with his penis.", "Is he still in love with her? Sorry but his need to feel like he has to be there indicates he is in love with her and not you. He is priorizing her feelings over yours. Sorry darling time to cut him loose. He doesn't fancy himself in love with you.", "NTA. Literally dump him though. Why give your acceptance for him to contact someone he cheated with? She's not his friend who lost a child, she's the person he betrayed you with. You need to recognize your worth and leave him. He isn't over her.", "Get a lawyer. Keep it quiet until you are ready to act. Don\u2019t leave the house make him leave when the time comes. Put yourself first from now on.", "Wowww just wowwwww, after reading your post I had to take a minute to take everything in because this marriage is a MESS. Your husband has no respect for you and his excuse of her not having anyone is bullshit, how does he know who she has or doesn\u2019t have in his life if they are not even in touch? Also, how was she even able to contact him? Why would she contact him first? She clearly feels like they are still close enough for her to contact him he definitely left that door open for her or is still in touch with her. I wouldn\u2019t trust him", "They still have enough of an emotional connection to be each other's support after a year? And he knew the daughter well enough to be willing to shit on your feelings by going and talking to you about it. He's still in love with her", "NTA He cheated on you, when all was revealed you decided to stay with him and he decided to break it off with her. That should mean he breaks everything off with her forever if he really wants to give the two of you a chance. He cannot be there for her anymore. \n\nAlso assuming since this was an affair he never even really met the daughter. If he had a relationship with the daughter and he was living some sort of double life I have to stay you should have walked away a year ago...", "YTA to yourself for staying with a cheater who wants to maintain a relationship with his affair partner, perhaps he'll be able to give her some \"help\" during this difficult time. Fuck them both. If you don't do anything else, please consider therapy and leaving this emotionally manipulative asshole. You seem to be more angry at this woman but she didn't rape him\u2013 he willingly slept with her, you should be upset at them both. Don't be a woman who acts as if men hold less responsibility for cheating. His continued communication with this person shows you *he* was a willing participate.

He\u2019s going to hold and comfort her. She did this as a way to humiliate you.", "You are NTA for feeling that way.   \nYou would be TA if you acted on those feelings. This is a shitty situation overall.", "I was on the y-t-a train until I see you let him go to the funeral. I say NTA. He cheated on you and you are angry about the cheating not really the funeral or caring that someone died. It is his cheating that you are mad about and he was wrong and TA for doing that. You will need to do therapy and deal with the infidelity as you can. I get him going to the funeral. Someone he knew died. But he shouldn't have known her. Because he should have cheated. So, NTA and this whole situation sucks.", "NTA\n\nI think your response is perfectly valid but I think you have to relinquish control of the situation. \n\nIt sounds like you haven\u2019t yet acted on your emotions and I don\u2019t think you should.\n\nWith that said, it seems perfectly reasonable for him to want to attend the funeral.", "You both ATA\nShow you are the bigger woman and go to the funeral with him.\n\nHe's the AH because he cheated on you, and he fails to see or understand the damage his nasty affair did to you.", "NAH\n\nOther deaths sometimes make me revisit the death of an old friend and all the complicated feelings I have. (We weren't close anymore but it was just really sad.) \n\nSo I can see how he might have feelings stirred up and just feels pulled to be there. \n\nI get that it's complicated for you but I might just let it be what it is - a sad day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like she has a problem. But her solution is not to expect your husband to take care of her, and your husband has absolutely no obligation to her, unless he is choosing to shit all over his obligations to you and your marriage.\n\nYour feelings, your security, your peace of mind, have to be more important to him than hers or his own.  If he wants to be with you, he has to step up and do like the vow says - forsake all others.  If that's too much for him to do, you should leave him.  You deserve to be his priority.", "This is not his or your responsibility. HIs responsibility is to you esp given the history. She has family & theres counseling.", "And i guarantee he is holding hugging and kissing his AP op LEAVE NOW please have some self respect", "I wish happiness for you", "It isn\u2019t starting over. It\u2019s moving forward, respecting yourself, and laying the groundwork for a beautiful new future. Why stay in a broken marriage when you could leave, travel, find out who you are as just you, gain inner peace, and maybe meet someone amazing eventually who would never cheat on you? Take a gamble on future you. She deserves better.", "I feel you, OP. I was dumped by my cheating husband about a year after I had forgiven him for an earlier cheating episode. I was in my late 50s, physically disabled, with two teens still at home. I was terrified -- literally curled in a ball on the floor scared. I had a small amount in savings, but then he went scorched earth in the divorce. It was hell. Like you, I no longer had much of a mind of my own after being under my husband's thumb for decades during my marriage. I got counseling and learned about the ways I had enabled my ex to take advantage of me. I slowly learned how to set boundaries. (One book that helped me was Lundy Bancroft's \"Why Does He Do That?\" It's available for free download on his website.) And, after four years of struggle, with my kids all young adults, I ventured out to meet people, found some great friends, and met the real love of my life. I have been married for five years to a man who treats me wonderfully and is more of a father to my kids than their own father was. The pain and challenge I went through, even though it scarred me in some ways, made me grow as a person. Getting kicked out of my bad marriage made room in my life for a healthy single life and then a truly happy marriage. Best of luck, OP, whatever direction you take.", "And he answered? Or listened to the message?\n\nEither way- he shouldn\u2019t be answering calls from numbers he doesn\u2019t know. And if he got a voicemail, he could have listened and deleted and not responded.\n\nI understand feeling bad for someone you know that has lost a child. But that\u2019s not an excuse. If anything, this could trigger the start of an affair again. People being emotional, not thinking clearly, and wanting comfort. Id be very cautious.", "Don\u2019t beat yourself up. You have been treated pretty badly and it\u2019s hard to walk away from someone you have spent most of your life with. Have you set any boundaries about him getting home early and cutting contact again ? He is not caring about you in all this. He is caring about her and himself but not you . Stand up for yourself . He\u2019s not going to", "Him saying that seems to be some supreme manipulation shite to me.", "WTAF?! He\u2019s completely the asshole! I am so sorry for your loss. That is the ultimate in manipulation. Wow.", "He was and has been lying to you this whole time", "So how many more years are you giving up for this piece of sh!t why should he be happy while you have to suffer", "But why would he be welcomed? \n\nDoes her family and friends know of their relationship (I assume, they haven\u2019t told anyone it was an affair)? If not him showing up as her main support person is strange.", "If your not welcome then he doesn't go.", "When he gets home, have his bags packed and on the porch. Tell him he needs to go.", "Yeah but to call the man you had an affair with?. After this they will start talking again and tell you that they are just grieving together and she needs someone to talk to and from there it will spiral", "Because there's history between your partner and the deceased. You can't tell someone how to feel/it's completely outside of your control", "You're welcome.", "You need to have a clear conversation where you allowed him to go to the funeral, she should be calling him for support. He is done with her after giving his time for the funeral. It is not his job to support her and if he says she needs me, you say ok divorce. She needs to lean on people who should be a part of her daily life, not your husband. If he can\u2019t give boundaries to her and understand, he will cheat again and he will always put her first. You don\u2019t deserve to come second.", "Also I don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t like you. She was the home-wrecker!", "Dump him queen", "So he takes off his ring at the funeral? The audacity of him convincing you, that it was **remotely** acceptable, to attend a funeral with his **ex-mistress**.", "100 percent she died suddenly. I have looked up the obit.", "Yup this is my guess. Why was OPs husband one of the people the mistress called after her daughters death? Why is she not fully blocked in every way?

Its just hard. Spent so much time building him up that i broke myself down.", "We have been together for 30 years. Def not his.", "Looking back itbwas prob just bs", "This. It sounds like the other woman knew OP and husband were married, if their affair was a year ago and OP knew all about it. It's so icky she's turning to her old affair partner for support. Does she not have anyone else? Why was her default to go to OP's husband instead of a friend/family member for support?", "Yeah that", "Because i didnt stop loving him even after he hurt me", "Agreed.", "Thank you because right now im miserable..ugh", "Thank you", "Thank you for the book suggestion.", "Thank you. Im honestly thinking about just how much he does not give AF about my feelings and why am I feeling so paralyzed.", "I have been researching narcissism..and I think he checks alot of the boxes..unfortunately that makes me an enabler.", "Yeah. And i feel dumb af", "I dont think she has told her friends family he is married..so they may think hes a boyfriend/ guyfriend?", "Ugly wouldnt even describe that senario", "What history?  He had an affair with the mother of an adult daughter. He may not have even met her.", "How to feel?  Maybe not (although if he wants to stay married he really should consider whether he FEELS like his wife's feelings trump his mistress's).  How to act?  Most definitely.", "Because i caught them together once and caused a big scene in public.", "I mean, let's be fair, if OP is a normal person she loves and pair-bonds, and she projects her own loyalty and devotion on her spouse, and can't quite comprehend that he would be such a disloyal shit, because such a thing would be unthinkable to her.\n\nUnfortunately, hubby ain't like her.", "She can travel I assume?

You\u2019ve been with this person for decades, I think I saw you say you have a child. We don\u2019t know your financial situation, what kind of support network you have, and years of gaslighting and emotional abuse can severely alter a person and their decision making abilities. That being said, I think you need to start documenting everything and formulating a plan that fits your situation best. You deserve better.", "As you should and i don't mean to be harsh but look your husband is at a funeral for his AP daughter that should show you how much he cares and respects you which is none and i know you didn't want to leave a 30 YR relationship but guess what those 30 years didn't stop him from cheating and he is still cheating LEAVE OP and DIVORCE", "I would ask to come with him to support him.

I\u2019m assuming there is one, else it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to be there.", "Good for you! You should have caused a big scene in public.

That's not always the best solution after an affair. Maybe it ultimately will be, but if I were you I definitely wouldn't make any decision about it in this moment given the current crisis. Your feelings are totally understandable. What's in your best interest long-term is a larger question. If you haven't sought individual and/or marriage counseling since this affair, it could be very helpful.", "That is a difficult situation. I went through a similar one except I was the child and my mom was in your shoes. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in the US, but perhaps you can start looking for local supportive services?
