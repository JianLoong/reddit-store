He should not have gone. \n\nNTA", "I think allow him to check on her was a mistake. She is using this to keep him in her life.

She is having a hard time and needs him to lean on.", "NTA for your feelings.  \n\nIt sounds like it was her daughter, not his, so why is he prioritizing his affair partner's feelings over his wife's?   So he has feelings about the loss of his god daughter--well guess what?  His feelings come last after he is the one that decided to cheat and you graciously decided not to kick him to the curb.  \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have forgiven him for the cheating so for me this would have been a non-issue--I don't share like that.", "NTA.\n\n\"Im not being supportive of his feelings.\" Wow, that is manipulative. \n\nLike, he cheats and is all upset you aren't OK with him going to be in proximity with his mistress?!", "I think it might be time for you to 1. get a lawyer and 2. a therapist to help you get through all of this. Your husband cannot be this woman\u2019s emotional support person if he\u2019s committed to your marriage. There is no other way around it. In order for your marriage to survive, he has to cut ties with this woman. The fact that he is not willing to do so means that you do not have a good marriage. It\u2019s sad that this woman lost her daughter, but it\u2019s not your husband\u2019s place to support her. And if your husband is sad about losing his goddaughter, he should turn to *you* not the AP to grieve.", "ESH.  He's a cheater, and you're staying with a cheater who keeps a relationship with his mistress (and complaining about it) instead of just walking away from this unfaithful man.", "NTA, Why is she calling a married man who she had an affair with for support/navigating grief. This would make anyone uncomfortable.. \u201c not being supportive of his feelings \u201c is comical. It takes a relationship a lot longer than a year to recover from infidelity, and how is he helping you at all by keeping in contact and being a support system to this woman he owes absolutely nothing to?", "NTA. Be careful though, grieving people often turn to s.e.x to deal with their pain. I think your husband\u2019s mistress invited her after service booty call and he jumped right on board. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear he cheated again, it was an emotional time after the funeral, you don\u2019t understand the pain and loss, you\u2019re being selfish, etc etc. RUN, GIRL RUN!", "Can I go and provide emotional support to the woman I put my dick in last year?? The fact that he\u2019s asking you is the worst. I\u2019d be peacing at this point. Single is better than this garbage!", "NTA - why you are accepting contact with those two is beyond me.  Yes she lost her daughter but she has to have better support then your husband.\n\nThe only way I would go is if I went.

This would be a hill to die on imo - he should not be in contact whatsoever with his former affair partner, and certainly shouldn\u2019t be attending the funeral to comfort her. Why are you still with this manipulative cheater who can\u2019t let his mistress go?", "NTA. While I am sorry for her lose, supporting her is the role of a friend or partner. By putting himself in a supporting role, he is putting himself back into a similar role as when he cheated on you.", "NTA and in situations like these all the support a man can ask for is about you not throwing his belongings on the street. You did not throw his belongings, you're morally ok.", "NTA. Why is she even able to contact him? \n\nIt\u2019s a terrible situation for the woman, but your husband cannot support her in this. Either he cuts all contact with her or you need to have consequences. People repairing relationships do not maintain contact with an affair partner.", "Oh my gosh you\u2019re a frickin Saint. This would be a hell no situation for me. Absolute bs. So you\u2019re supposed to sit home while these two cheating nimrods bond over their losses?? Yeah that affairs gonna start back up again. NTA for being so kind but damn girl this just ain\u2019t right.", "Ummm\u2026 No. And I\u2019d have left her to \u201cdo something stupid\u201d because obviously she is too useless to have her own husband and needs to call someone else\u2019s\u2026 She sounds stupid and useless and sorry about her child but why is she allowed to bother your husband?\n\nI\u2019d say no and if he went I\u2019d end things with him.

You are not being supportive of ***his feelings***?\n\nHow supportive of your feeling was he when he **had an affair?**  Were your feelings at the top of his mind when he was cheating on you?  Is he being supportive of your feelings by choosing to go be supportive of the other woman?\n\nI guess at least he told you that she contacted him.

Don't take this crap from him any more. \n\nNTA.", "Could it be his daughter? Did your husband and his mistress knew each other 20 years ago?", "Info: *WAS* the girl who died his goddaughter?", "NTA. \n\nCan you attend with him?  To support him and his sad reminder feelings of having lost a god daughter?  Or you know, for your peace of mind and to show the AP she is not manipulating anyone here.", "NTA. Geez this would be a deal breaker for me. Why do you even want to stay w him?", "Just let him go. Like sure go ahead but when you come back I\u2019m not going to be here. He cheated on you both emotionally and physically where he produced a full on child. He is by no means in deserving of your time or attention", "NTA", "NTA\nOP, you need to put your foot down and say \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d. I guarantee you he\u2019s still sleeping with her, so either you buckle down or buckle up to be mistreated again.", "NTA at all. Firstly, you haven't acted on your feelings, and your AITA question is basically asking if your feelings are wrong- nope, you are entitled to your feelings. Feelings are valid.\n\nI think you've been really compassionate in that you wanted your husband to provide initial telephone support to ensure her personal safety. Not many people would do that, which shows you are the better person in this situation.\n\nIt sounds to me like they both have unfinished business, considering he is her go-to for support rather than anyone else... and your husband jumps when summoned.\n\nUltimately, you need to do what is right for you because you deserve a life whereby you have love and loyalty. Your husband is without a doubt not a good person for you.", "NTA. Why is he even still in contact with this person? \n\nI don\u2019t have your patience, OP.", "NTA. He might console her with his penis.", "Is he still in love with her? Sorry but his need to feel like he has to be there indicates he is in love with her and not you. He is priorizing her feelings over yours. Sorry darling time to cut him loose. He doesn't fancy himself in love with you.", "NTA. Literally dump him though. Why give your acceptance for him to contact someone he cheated with? She's not his friend who lost a child, she's the person he betrayed you with. You need to recognize your worth and leave him. He isn't over her.", "Get a lawyer. Keep it quiet until you are ready to act. Don\u2019t leave the house make him leave when the time comes. Put yourself first from now on.", "Wowww just wowwwww, after reading your post I had to take a minute to take everything in because this marriage is a MESS. Your husband has no respect for you and his excuse of her not having anyone is bullshit, how does he know who she has or doesn\u2019t have in his life if they are not even in touch? Also, how was she even able to contact him? Why would she contact him first? She clearly feels like they are still close enough for her to contact him he definitely left that door open for her or is still in touch with her. I wouldn\u2019t trust him", "They still have enough of an emotional connection to be each other's support after a year? And he knew the daughter well enough to be willing to shit on your feelings by going and talking to you about it. He's still in love with her", "NTA He cheated on you, when all was revealed you decided to stay with him and he decided to break it off with her. That should mean he breaks everything off with her forever if he really wants to give the two of you a chance. He cannot be there for her anymore. \n\nAlso assuming since this was an affair he never even really met the daughter. If he had a relationship with the daughter and he was living some sort of double life I have to stay you should have walked away a year ago...", "YTA to yourself for staying with a cheater who wants to maintain a relationship with his affair partner, perhaps he'll be able to give her some \"help\" during this difficult time. Fuck them both. If you don't do anything else, please consider therapy and leaving this emotionally manipulative asshole. You seem to be more angry at this woman but she didn't rape him\u2013 he willingly slept with her, you should be upset at them both. Don't be a woman who acts as if men hold less responsibility for cheating. His continued communication with this person shows you *he* was a willing participate.

This is a shitty situation overall.", "I was on the y-t-a train until I see you let him go to the funeral. I say NTA. He cheated on you and you are angry about the cheating not really the funeral or caring that someone died. It is his cheating that you are mad about and he was wrong and TA for doing that. You will need to do therapy and deal with the infidelity as you can. I get him going to the funeral. Someone he knew died. But he shouldn't have known her. Because he should have cheated. So, NTA and this whole situation sucks.", "NTA\n\nI think your response is perfectly valid but I think you have to relinquish control of the situation. \n\nIt sounds like you haven\u2019t yet acted on your emotions and I don\u2019t think you should.\n\nWith that said, it seems perfectly reasonable for him to want to attend the funeral.", "You both ATA\nShow you are the bigger woman and go to the funeral with him.\n\nHe's the AH because he cheated on you, and he fails to see or understand the damage his nasty affair did to you.", "NAH\n\nOther deaths sometimes make me revisit the death of an old friend and all the complicated feelings I have. (We weren't close anymore but it was just really sad.) \n\nSo I can see how he might have feelings stirred up and just feels pulled to be there. \n\nI get that it's complicated for you but I might just let it be what it is - a sad day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go do it for yourself.", "That's the effect of being the \"supply\" person in orbit around your seemingly narc husband. Don't blame yourself. You have been a hostage to your spouse's disordered personality for a long time. It is typical for that to lead to a lack of self agency.", "Hon, here's a good website for you to peruse while he's being his schmoopie's shoulder to cry on and God knows what else. Spend some quality time at www.ChumpLady.com. Lots of information and great advice from a smart woman who's been through the cheating husband wringer, finally found her strength, walked away, found the right faithful man, and is a guiding light for others in your position. Also, she's hilarious. Seriously, hop on over there. Learn how to be mighty, as she'd say. And then YOU make a choice about whether he's worth another day of your precious, precious life.", "You should seriously consider std/sti testing if you haven't already. Whether you stay or go, he's not going to stop doing this and if it's not her it'll be someone else. These aren't the actions of someone trull repenting and trying to save your marriage. I'm older and been married a long time so I get that there's a lot of time, history, and, at one time, love but don't get caught in the sunk cost fallacy. Plus, your kids/friends/family may not know the details but they know something isn't right. I try to do what I'd want my kid to do...would you want your kid to have to constantly wonder about getting std's and living life thoroughly emotionally unsupported?", "You should have attended with him. You know as emotional support for him. That would have put a kink in both of their plans.", "Wish I could give you a massive hug.", "Don't give him a choice. Get a lawyer, change the locks and at least force a separation until you can divorce. This is all completely unacceptable.", "Don't feel dumb. He is a master liar and con man. And we never suspect that of someone until we can't avoid that conclusion.", "Sigh. I'm truly sorry but not surprised...the cheating, the manipulation, the way he does what he wants, pretending he's the good person and you're the bad one for feeling hurt. I am so sorry. The best thing to do when your spouse has this type of personality disorder is to get away from them and have as little contact with them as possible, while getting counseling for yourself. Above I recommended the Lundy Bancroft book, Why Does He Do That? I also recommend seeking help from domestic violence assistance organizations near you. DV is not just physical harm. It includes emotional harm, berating, and financial control. These people can gently assist you in breaking free safely. They may have free counseling and other resources. Good luck, OP. I know you are in pain now, and may be for some time, but going forward you can enjoy freedom -- the chance to think your thoughts and feel your feelings without someone else policing them. You will find much more happiness in your daily life one day.", "Nobody *likes* being confronted - but there\u2019s a world of difference between \u201che\u2019d cry and feel sorry for himself\u201d and \u201che would drain my bank account, turn my friends and family against me, sabotage my job and put me in the hospital.\u201d", "He doesnt want to be the \"bad guy\" so it could be a possibility.", "Happy for your grandma and a story worth repeating for people who stay in bad long-term relationships and are afraid to move on.", "Agreed but Some good advice I have taken from here is therapy.", "Im rooting for you though mate. Please update when youre ready. xxx", "I was already thinking along those lines of what do i need to do for me to get into a healthy headspace.", "Thank you", "..", "He is already the bad guy and is just continuing on being the bad guy.  You don't get to cheat on your wife and act like you are a white knight at the same time.", "I\u2019m sorry about this - sending good energy your way!", "The fact that it is a 30 year relationship with 3 kids and debt-ridden business, he has no qualms about sacrificing his marriage and risking the breaking up of his family by being unfaithful to you. \n\nHe has no fear, so why should you?", "So your life is less valuable than a house? You can get a better partner, a better house. If he leaves you for her or for other woman you would lose the house anyway", "You stay there and are teaching your 3 kids that they can do as their father has done or be passive like mom is.", "Leaving him would mean being debt free. Mak that the stipulation for divorce. That he has to take on the debt. And tell your church before he corrupts them against you by lying. It's obvious he knows how to lie and manipulate. He doesn't care about you because he blatantly put your health in harm's way, he could have picked up an STD and passed it to you. And if you never found out, sometimes those things can turn terminal. You deserve better, someone who doesn't put you in danger. NTA Do therapy, get some legal help, and untangle yourself from him. It will be worth it.", "Absolutely. Speak to them. Let them see the whole picture. They will have your best interests in mind.", "Where does OP explain that the husband did not know the deceased? Why are people making assumptions about the extent of the relationship the husband had with the deceased?", "Thank you", "He already his side peice support lined up I guess.  I see the horrible dating trials others go through and maybe have convinced myself I cant do better..or that there are no good guys out there. Maybe its just an excuse..idk", "The affair was kept private and my children are grown . I need to do it for myself not them", "It's throughout her replies in the comments. No one is making assumptions. They are reading her comments. Give it a try.", "Of course you don\u2019t know, hopefully therapy will help you figure it out. Start with improving yourself and when you\u2019re healthy you\u2019ll know exactly what to do. I learned this in Al-Anon and it has served me very well. When I got my head together I was able to deal with my problematic partner free of codependency and other baggage. \n\nThings will become clear. Trust yourself. Do the work. \u2764\ufe0f", "This is such a messed up situation. You can be compassionate and feel empathy for what she is going through, but this is wrong on every single level. He should have no contact with this woman, no matter what she\u2019s going through- he should no longer be an option for her. This is extremely disrespectful to you and your marriage. Honestly I would consider this worse than the cheating. What happens when someone else close to her dies, or she loses her home, or gets sick, etc?", "Good idea. Whatever you decide to do - stay or go - I think you need to stop acting like a doormat or he will continue to treat you like one. Good luck", "You deserve the support and the space to focus on your feelings and what you want for yourself. Good luck.", "Definitely. You deserve better.", "Sorry, I have to admit that I assumed.  It was either before the OP commented or I missed the comment.  I didn't see any mention one way or the other.\n\nI just thought that DH here was too busy in Mom's pants to develop a father/child type of relationship with her grown child.", "That is actually a big part of repairing a marriage after infidelity, you\u2019re right\u2014the husband MUST eliminate this woman from his life, no matter what. \n\nIf he can\u2019t or won\u2019t, you can\u2019t rebuild trust. It\u2019s already hard enough to rebuild trust. It\u2019s hard enough to get through it."]}
