We did it all through my childhood, my husband\u2019s family did it, my friend\u2019s families are similar, though for some it\u2019s just a walk, or some go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run.\n\nMy son Porter has been dating  Emily for the past 6 months. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s going to join us. They\u2019re coming from the city about 3 hours away so they\u2019ll be staying overnight. I\u2019ve met Emily before and think she\u2019s a great match for Porter. I know there\u2019s all that hoopla about the MIL/DIL dynamic and I just have no time for any of that. If Porter likes her and she treats him with kindness, and he the same who am I to complain.\n\nI skyped with them on Thanksgiving, just making plans for who\u2019s bringing what for Christmas, gifts and such, and I mentioned that she should remember to bring her hiking boots but we\u2019ll have plenty of yaktrax if the trails are icy. She was visibly confused and asked what for, so I explained. She got quiet and asked if she had to. I said no, of course she doesn\u2019t have to, but we\u2019ve always done this and I was surprised Porter didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe next day, Porter called, and explained that Emily is not in great shape and would struggle with keeping up, even on one of the easier trails nearby. He said that maybe we can just do a nice short family walk in the neighborhood this year so she feels more welcome.\n\nI said that maybe the two of them can hang back and enjoy a nice quiet morning before the festivities begin while the rest of us go for the hike. I remember being young with Porter\u2019s father and how special those early Christmas mornings always were. Plus this will be her first time with the family and it\u2019s going to be a LOT. \n\nPorter got annoyed and said I\u2019m not not hearing him. He said that he really thinks we need to cut the hike down or make different plans.\n\nI told him in return that this is a family tradition that goes back for years, and changing it for one person isn\u2019t fair to the rest of the family. We\u2019re at a stalemate. I even said that if they hang back for the morning, I\u2019d be happy to go on a nice walk with Emily and Porter later in the day during a quiet moment. He said I\u2019m still not hearing him.\n\nAITA for not being willing to downgrade the hike to a little stroll around the neighborhood?", "created_utc": 1669681314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7dsgn/aita_for_not_downgrading_the_family_prefeast_hike/", "score": 3272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you just \"go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run\" but instead make it a walk, or like walk around a city and if it is too much for her, then her and Porter can rest on a bench or go to a Chinese food restaurant (because it would be open for xmas). Or if you want to go on a true hike in the woods, just tell them that they should join you all, but if they want to turn around and head back early, it is totally okay. Maybe have them pack a picnic too so they have something to do while they wait for you to get back... or take separate cars so they can drive home. \n\nI think the girlfriend is worried that she will seem controlling or like a downer/drama queen if she insists on staying home while the whole family goes out for a hike that may be too much for her. Some people have asthma, lyme disease, lupus, you name it, that may be hard for them to be too physical. I am one of those people, and although I can handle moderate physical exercise, I cannot do strenuous. But I hate being that someone that can't keep up or can't participate.", "People are stating you offered compromises, but in fact you offered alternatives for Porter and Emily that still separated them from the family.  \n\nI liked the idea offered in another comment, to do a loop hike where people can choose how far they want to walk.  Or choose a route that has natural stopping points where you can choose to continue, or go back.\n\nIf I were you I'd speak directly to Emily and see what she wants.  Of course she doesn't have to hike if she doesn't want to, but if she wants to try and join in, talk to her about options to see what will work for all of you.  I, for example, cannot do speed, or steep inclines, but I sometimes choose to do as much as I can and then wait for everyone else to finish the harder part.  And sometimes I gratefully snuggle under the blankets and read my book when everyone goes out and the house is quiet.\n\nTo make her feel welcome, find out what welcome looks like to her.

I read this tradition crap on this sub so often and it's always an excuse to exclude individuals from a family or just be obnoxious.", "YTA on so many levels. I'm guessing Porter didn't mention this \"tradition\" because it's become a habit that nobody wants to break rather than something everyone enjoys. Additionally, since you think running 3K - 10K is \"easy\", it's obvious that you don't recognize the physical limitations of others or how to accommodate them so that they can still participate in a meaningful way - not \"hanging back having a quiet morning\".

An ableist AH, at that. There is no difference between a hike and a walk, and family tradition should not be given priority over the actual family members. If your son was in a wheelchair, would you exclude him from this family tradition year after year? Or would you go on wheelchair friendly hikes? What if Emily gets pregnant with your son's child and shouldn't go on a hike? You are making the decision for your son and his girlfriend. You're telling them that they're basically not allowed to come because you're too stubborn and entitled to try something a little different one year.

We did it all through my childhood, my husband\u2019s family did it, my friend\u2019s families are similar, though for some it\u2019s just a walk, or some go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run.\n\nMy son Porter has been dating  Emily for the past 6 months. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s going to join us. They\u2019re coming from the city about 3 hours away so they\u2019ll be staying overnight. I\u2019ve met Emily before and think she\u2019s a great match for Porter. I know there\u2019s all that hoopla about the MIL/DIL dynamic and I just have no time for any of that. If Porter likes her and she treats him with kindness, and he the same who am I to complain.\n\nI skyped with them on Thanksgiving, just making plans for who\u2019s bringing what for Christmas, gifts and such, and I mentioned that she should remember to bring her hiking boots but we\u2019ll have plenty of yaktrax if the trails are icy. She was visibly confused and asked what for, so I explained. She got quiet and asked if she had to. I said no, of course she doesn\u2019t have to, but we\u2019ve always done this and I was surprised Porter didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe next day, Porter called, and explained that Emily is not in great shape and would struggle with keeping up, even on one of the easier trails nearby. He said that maybe we can just do a nice short family walk in the neighborhood this year so she feels more welcome.\n\nI said that maybe the two of them can hang back and enjoy a nice quiet morning before the festivities begin while the rest of us go for the hike. I remember being young with Porter\u2019s father and how special those early Christmas mornings always were. Plus this will be her first time with the family and it\u2019s going to be a LOT. \n\nPorter got annoyed and said I\u2019m not not hearing him. He said that he really thinks we need to cut the hike down or make different plans.\n\nI told him in return that this is a family tradition that goes back for years, and changing it for one person isn\u2019t fair to the rest of the family. We\u2019re at a stalemate. I even said that if they hang back for the morning, I\u2019d be happy to go on a nice walk with Emily and Porter later in the day during a quiet moment. He said I\u2019m still not hearing him.\n\nAITA for not being willing to downgrade the hike to a little stroll around the neighborhood?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was too tired and too sore to get off my butt and help his mom in the kitchen. And I was soooooo embarrassed about that. Again, they were nothing but lovely the whole time I knew them.

I'm not in the best shape, and one summer ended up hiking in a group that I was way too optimistic in joining. The others recognized this but didn't want to discourage me. So they chose hikes that, while still challenging, had frequent points to 'enjoy the scenery' aka let me rest for a few minutes. I figured this out pretty quickly, since once I got better at it they stopped needing to enjoy the view as much. But I was never made to feel bad when I needed a minute before going on. And they seemed to appreciate that I was still game to do the more challenging bits after a rest. \n\nOffering a 'sightseeing' hike with plenty of opportunities to rest could be a compromise. Or letting her sit this out. I don't think changing the plan completely for one person is a good idea.", "NTA, but speaking as a person with chronic illness who loves hikes but might not be able to keep up: Is it an option to join the family for a part of the hike and turn around when she's had enough?", "NTA I believe you are being more than accommodating and open minded about her and her situation. Have a great holiday guilt free.", "NAH maybe she\u2019s pregnant, or maybe she won\u2019t keep up, but you son is torn. He trying to make everyone happy, including himself.

Maybe she and Porter can stay back after that and do something like make hot chocolate for everyone coming back from the hike.

There are A THOUSAND things that could be contributing to this: May he's already been managing her stress around the trip in general and he just realllly needs a break from the anxiety, maybe the girlfriend comes from an exacting punitive and abusive home and she's projecting her deep fears onto this walk, maybe they're dancing around something traumatic... maybe she hurt herself in an incident they're not sharing with people and she actually cannot walk that far.

Look, this could be misplaced stress and miscommunication, or this might be the beginning of a troubling pattern with this girlfriend, you just don't know yet, but you'll be in a better place to help your son and observe from a compassionate standpoint if you don't feed the possible conflict/ \"power struggle\" narrative on their first year with you. (If she's pressuring him to take a stand to defend her there's no winning for him this trip... and she'll be able to fall back on this incident to show that it's two sided for the rest of the relationship, and it'll seed the feelings of \"going to parents' becomes stressful because there's a power struggle) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nIt's giving me this vibe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement\\_of\\_Solomon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour rationale is amazing, and you've already compassionately put yourselves in their shoes (And you're right, they're going to cherish the quiet moments they have just the two of them.)

None refused, but if they did I\u2019d say I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re done and you can join us then. \n\nYes someday I\u2019ll be too old, but my Dad is 78 and only the last couple of years or so is maybe too old. (We only go about three miles.) He\u2019s had some falls recently and is in good enough shape as far as his cardiovascular functions but he\u2019s having therapy to help his strength and balance as he recovers from a recent fall. Maybe he\u2019ll be on a trail again, maybe not but he can easily do three flat miles. Doctors have told him to use his judgement and while I\u2019ll try to stop him from taking crazy risks I\u2019ll help him do what seems reasonable if he wants to do it. We\u2019re going to be doing water exercise classes soon when he\u2019s healed enough from surgery to help him get strength and balance back.\n\nI still have a lot of years left to do the hikes. Don\u2019t want to miss out! Life is too short. My Mom and brother are deceased so I can\u2019t go with them any more. It\u2019s nice to now go with my husband! My Dad has gone with us maybe three years ago. I hope he will again. If not we\u2019ll do flat walks when we are with him. My husband doesn\u2019t have the 25 years or so of history doing these hikes as a family on Christmas and Thanksgiving so I can go on the trail with him on a different day, like the day after, and he won\u2019t be missing the tradition. If I can\u2019t go with my family of origin it\u2019s not the same - I don\u2019t mind adjusting the day to be with my Dad on the holiday. But I still want to do it. I would go alone if I had to. It\u2019s essential as long as I\u2019m blessed to be able to do it.\n\nI think you should keep the hike intact for as long as you are able to do it. Enjoy each time - I know how precious it is.", "I would hike 10k happily, but running it? No thank you. Good for people who still have plenty of cartilage in their knees, I guess.\n\nBut-- if I *were* a runner from a family of runners and that was my Christmas tradition? I would be super sad to miss it.", "Look up \u201cTurkey Trots\u201d and \u201cReindeer/Jingle Bell\u201d runs. Also, \u201cHair of the Dog\u201d. Back when I did as many races as I could I once ran five or six within the first/last week of the year due to all the holiday themed events.", "You do you. If you want to wake up on Christmas morning and start running...you go for it. Crush that goal, friend.", "Christmas hikes aren't much of a thing where I live but lots of families do turkey trots in November. There was even a pretty big race the morning of Thanksgiving in the next town over when I was in high school.\n\nChristmas Day hunts are a huge thing too though, so it's likely very regional.", "Totally agree. I think she is pregnant.", "Not only that but why should a whole family change for 1 person, who like you said, haven\u2019t even met her yet? Why should everyone miss out for one person? She made heaps of perfectly reasonable comprised and Porter is just having none of it. That\u2019s an A H move.", "All her \"solutions\" were about preserving her tradition, not welcoming someone new to the family.", "Technicalities. Guests should be treated well, anyway.", "I'm also surprised that this hasn't come up before-- like, literally everyone is in the position to join the hike every year?  you don't have parents with tiny babies who aren't up for the hike, or someone who has an injury, or someone who is hung over or whatever? From OP's comments, it sounds like she herself skipped the hike at times in her marriage. \n\nSounds like her son isn't thinking beyond \"I will have to miss it, so i want everyone to miss it too\"", "I adore all of this", "I'm sorry, I read only 1-2 hrs as being common family activity and I just blanked out.  To be fair, I don't come from healthy family dynamics so if there isn't food to shut everyone's mouths or alcohol to make the older adults more funny than critical and judgy, then it's less family time and more emotional massacre.", "If I had an award i\u2019d give it to you!!!", "Wrong wording. He's making a mountain out of a molehill? He has a bee in his bonnet? He's being a bull in a china shop? He's going balls to the wall? He needs to cool his jets? He's burning bridges? Pick your cliche", "The suburbs isn't a nature trail.", "OP listed compromises she offered in her post. He rejected every single one. What more do you want from her?", "Our holiday hikes are on a scenic and historic trail. Walking in the neighborhood is not even close to the same thing. Yes it\u2019s exercise, but we also want the prairie, the birds, the rivers, the historic ruins, the rapids, the waterfalls, the native forest, the bald eagles, the kingfishers, etc.", "Apparently they think \u201cHow dare people on the internet like things I don\u2019t like, if I don\u2019t like it, no one likes it and it\u2019s bad. \u201c", "Op is more than comfortable with them not participating by staying home, doing something by themselves, and is even comfortable going on a shorter hike / walk later. Op ( at least in the post ) isn't judging and being fairly accommodating.. Changing entire family plans over one person not even a month before the event is a little outrageous and its confusing anyone expects something different.", "Lol same. Especially on Christmas Day, that\u2019s taking up precious drinking time. For sure, first impressions are something you only get one shot at", "I think the \"she is embarrassed\" is what he is trying to say OP isnt hearing. Anything other than the Emily being able to participate fully means she will be embarrassed, and so he thinks the entire family should accommodate her, rather than them (her) stand out because they arent participating. What he isnt grasping is that far more attention will be called to the fact that Emily is out of shape if everyone is asking why the hike isnt happening like it always does, rather than them just playing the young couple wanting some space card.", "Took some friends horseback riding. Ummmmm. Knew it was their first time riding but didn\u2019t know they BOTH HAD KNEE ISSUES. They were such troopers but they wanted to get off and insisted on us continuing and come back for them. We were only 30min into the ride. They got to rest for a bit (we cut the ride short) then came back and walked the them both back on the horses. They felt bad. I felt like an ass! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's not the sexist part.", "You\u2019ve made me want to take my emotional support condiments on a hike. Make them feel some love", "And here I thought I was the only one on the planet with sentimental condiments! I borrowed the molasses from my grandma, and she passed away suddenly from cancer. It\u2019s all I have left of her, so just seeing it in the fridge door makes me smile. I intend on keeping it as long as possible as well! I might have to take mine on a road trip, it hasn\u2019t travelled the world like your rock sugar lol", "I\u2019m Canadian and we do this, it\u2019s not a hike in the woods, just a go around a few blocks to look at the lights on Christmas Eve.", "Admittedly we both have our moments. Lol", "Yeah, for real. I cherish those moments alone when I'm on trips with my bf's family. I love spending time with them, but I need time to recharge, too.", "Why would they wait around instead of going back home? I\u2019m confused", "Right? That would be way more embarrassing", "Care to enlighten me? Because I'm legitimately missing it.", "You\u2019re awesome:)", "They've been there through so much, we all owe our expired condiments, dressings, and spices a day of pampering. The small tin of allspice I took from my mom in 2004 that expired sometime in the 90's is an equal beneficiary in my will.", "Why would they wait around instead of going back home? I\u2019m confused.\n\nEdit. Oh, sounds like someone suggested further up that they wait around. That\u2019s silly.", "Not sure booze + hike + unfit/ out of shape GF + potentially ice and snow = a safe environment", "Right, walking across a parking lot at night when you can\u2019t see the ice well is dangerous AF without spikes.", "I assume anything that passes the smell/taste test will last forever. Also, the freezer stops time. My husband disagrees and clears my things out every now and then. I tell him I just need to go to another room so I don't know what he's throwing out.", "Another Seattle perspective:\n\nI'm disabled but hike at least once a week (helps my AS pain feel a smidge better). I don't use yaktrax for hikes because microspikes (aka \"trail crampons\") are much better for the icy kind of snow we get in the mountains, even at low elevation. I've used them at Tiger Mtn and Little Si. They grip much better on the ice (actually dig into it). I'm not really hardcore, just prepared and been hiking since 2010 regularly. I've got a new set of snowshoes that I'm itching to use... hopefully we'll get enough lowland snow for me to not have to travel far to use them. \n\nI definitely use yaktrax around town though when we get icy snow. They are super helpful!"]}
