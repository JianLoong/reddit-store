We did it all through my childhood, my husband\u2019s family did it, my friend\u2019s families are similar, though for some it\u2019s just a walk, or some go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run.\n\nMy son Porter has been dating  Emily for the past 6 months. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s going to join us. They\u2019re coming from the city about 3 hours away so they\u2019ll be staying overnight. I\u2019ve met Emily before and think she\u2019s a great match for Porter. I know there\u2019s all that hoopla about the MIL/DIL dynamic and I just have no time for any of that. If Porter likes her and she treats him with kindness, and he the same who am I to complain.\n\nI skyped with them on Thanksgiving, just making plans for who\u2019s bringing what for Christmas, gifts and such, and I mentioned that she should remember to bring her hiking boots but we\u2019ll have plenty of yaktrax if the trails are icy. She was visibly confused and asked what for, so I explained. She got quiet and asked if she had to. I said no, of course she doesn\u2019t have to, but we\u2019ve always done this and I was surprised Porter didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe next day, Porter called, and explained that Emily is not in great shape and would struggle with keeping up, even on one of the easier trails nearby. He said that maybe we can just do a nice short family walk in the neighborhood this year so she feels more welcome.\n\nI said that maybe the two of them can hang back and enjoy a nice quiet morning before the festivities begin while the rest of us go for the hike. I remember being young with Porter\u2019s father and how special those early Christmas mornings always were. Plus this will be her first time with the family and it\u2019s going to be a LOT. \n\nPorter got annoyed and said I\u2019m not not hearing him. He said that he really thinks we need to cut the hike down or make different plans.\n\nI told him in return that this is a family tradition that goes back for years, and changing it for one person isn\u2019t fair to the rest of the family. We\u2019re at a stalemate. I even said that if they hang back for the morning, I\u2019d be happy to go on a nice walk with Emily and Porter later in the day during a quiet moment. He said I\u2019m still not hearing him.\n\nAITA for not being willing to downgrade the hike to a little stroll around the neighborhood?", "created_utc": 1669681314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7dsgn/aita_for_not_downgrading_the_family_prefeast_hike/", "score": 683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you just \"go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run\" but instead make it a walk, or like walk around a city and if it is too much for her, then her and Porter can rest on a bench or go to a Chinese food restaurant (because it would be open for xmas). Or if you want to go on a true hike in the woods, just tell them that they should join you all, but if they want to turn around and head back early, it is totally okay. Maybe have them pack a picnic too so they have something to do while they wait for you to get back... or take separate cars so they can drive home. \n\nI think the girlfriend is worried that she will seem controlling or like a downer/drama queen if she insists on staying home while the whole family goes out for a hike that may be too much for her. Some people have asthma, lyme disease, lupus, you name it, that may be hard for them to be too physical. I am one of those people, and although I can handle moderate physical exercise, I cannot do strenuous. But I hate being that someone that can't keep up or can't participate.", "People are stating you offered compromises, but in fact you offered alternatives for Porter and Emily that still separated them from the family.  \n\nI liked the idea offered in another comment, to do a loop hike where people can choose how far they want to walk.  Or choose a route that has natural stopping points where you can choose to continue, or go back.\n\nIf I were you I'd speak directly to Emily and see what she wants.  Of course she doesn't have to hike if she doesn't want to, but if she wants to try and join in, talk to her about options to see what will work for all of you.  I, for example, cannot do speed, or steep inclines, but I sometimes choose to do as much as I can and then wait for everyone else to finish the harder part.  And sometimes I gratefully snuggle under the blankets and read my book when everyone goes out and the house is quiet.\n\nTo make her feel welcome, find out what welcome looks like to her.  A stroll through the neighborhood is a huge change from a 5K or a vigorous hike, and that is awkward. But a stroll to the starting point of the hike might be inclusive.

As my kids added partners and other families to share holidays with, I figured out that sometimes we needed new traditions or ways to flex the old ones. Traditions are nice rituals until they start causing hard feelings.  Accommodating their chosen partners is another way I love on my kids.", "YTA. I read this tradition crap on this sub so often and it's always an excuse to exclude individuals from a family or just be obnoxious.", "YTA on so many levels. I'm guessing Porter didn't mention this \"tradition\" because it's become a habit that nobody wants to break rather than something everyone enjoys. Additionally, since you think running 3K - 10K is \"easy\", it's obvious that you don't recognize the physical limitations of others or how to accommodate them so that they can still participate in a meaningful way - not \"hanging back having a quiet morning\". If she turns out to be your future DIL, don't complain about your grandkids not being there for the Xmas hike because you cannot accommodate their mother with a walk that she can reasonably handle.

Would you change the route for her then?\n\nYou have all sorts of options. You could pick a loop and she could do one while everyone does two or three. You could really do anything, but instead you've decided tradition is more important. Even if it means excluding your son's girlfriend and alienating a potential future daughter-in-law.", "YTA. An ableist AH, at that. There is no difference between a hike and a walk, and family tradition should not be given priority over the actual family members. If your son was in a wheelchair, would you exclude him from this family tradition year after year? Or would you go on wheelchair friendly hikes? What if Emily gets pregnant with your son's child and shouldn't go on a hike? You are making the decision for your son and his girlfriend. You're telling them that they're basically not allowed to come because you're too stubborn and entitled to try something a little different one year.

We did it all through my childhood, my husband\u2019s family did it, my friend\u2019s families are similar, though for some it\u2019s just a walk, or some go into the city and do an easy 5 or 10k run.\n\nMy son Porter has been dating  Emily for the past 6 months. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s going to join us. They\u2019re coming from the city about 3 hours away so they\u2019ll be staying overnight. I\u2019ve met Emily before and think she\u2019s a great match for Porter. I know there\u2019s all that hoopla about the MIL/DIL dynamic and I just have no time for any of that. If Porter likes her and she treats him with kindness, and he the same who am I to complain.\n\nI skyped with them on Thanksgiving, just making plans for who\u2019s bringing what for Christmas, gifts and such, and I mentioned that she should remember to bring her hiking boots but we\u2019ll have plenty of yaktrax if the trails are icy. She was visibly confused and asked what for, so I explained. She got quiet and asked if she had to. I said no, of course she doesn\u2019t have to, but we\u2019ve always done this and I was surprised Porter didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe next day, Porter called, and explained that Emily is not in great shape and would struggle with keeping up, even on one of the easier trails nearby. He said that maybe we can just do a nice short family walk in the neighborhood this year so she feels more welcome.\n\nI said that maybe the two of them can hang back and enjoy a nice quiet morning before the festivities begin while the rest of us go for the hike. I remember being young with Porter\u2019s father and how special those early Christmas mornings always were. Plus this will be her first time with the family and it\u2019s going to be a LOT. \n\nPorter got annoyed and said I\u2019m not not hearing him. He said that he really thinks we need to cut the hike down or make different plans.\n\nI told him in return that this is a family tradition that goes back for years, and changing it for one person isn\u2019t fair to the rest of the family. We\u2019re at a stalemate. I even said that if they hang back for the morning, I\u2019d be happy to go on a nice walk with Emily and Porter later in the day during a quiet moment. He said I\u2019m still not hearing him.\n\nAITA for not being willing to downgrade the hike to a little stroll around the neighborhood?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s good that he wants to stick around with her but rather selfish of him to pull that kind of whine. Has he always been a bit like this?

They were considerate and welcoming and just really great people. I was in great shape. But, I had no experience hiking. I kept up easily enough. But after we returned to their family home? I was too tired and too sore to get off my butt and help his mom in the kitchen. And I was soooooo embarrassed about that. Again, they were nothing but lovely the whole time I knew them.

I'm not in the best shape, and one summer ended up hiking in a group that I was way too optimistic in joining. The others recognized this but didn't want to discourage me. So they chose hikes that, while still challenging, had frequent points to 'enjoy the scenery' aka let me rest for a few minutes. I figured this out pretty quickly, since once I got better at it they stopped needing to enjoy the view as much. But I was never made to feel bad when I needed a minute before going on. And they seemed to appreciate that I was still game to do the more challenging bits after a rest. \n\nOffering a 'sightseeing' hike with plenty of opportunities to rest could be a compromise. Or letting her sit this out. I don't think changing the plan completely for one person is a good idea.", "NTA, but speaking as a person with chronic illness who loves hikes but might not be able to keep up: Is it an option to join the family for a part of the hike and turn around when she's had enough?", "NTA I believe you are being more than accommodating and open minded about her and her situation. Have a great holiday guilt free.", "NAH maybe she\u2019s pregnant, or maybe she won\u2019t keep up, but you son is torn. He trying to make everyone happy, including himself.

There are A THOUSAND things that could be contributing to this: May he's already been managing her stress around the trip in general and he just realllly needs a break from the anxiety, maybe the girlfriend comes from an exacting punitive and abusive home and she's projecting her deep fears onto this walk, maybe they're dancing around something traumatic... maybe she hurt herself in an incident they're not sharing with people and she actually cannot walk that far.

Look, this could be misplaced stress and miscommunication, or this might be the beginning of a troubling pattern with this girlfriend, you just don't know yet, but you'll be in a better place to help your son and observe from a compassionate standpoint if you don't feed the possible conflict/ \"power struggle\" narrative on their first year with you. (If she's pressuring him to take a stand to defend her there's no winning for him this trip... and she'll be able to fall back on this incident to show that it's two sided for the rest of the relationship, and it'll seed the feelings of \"going to parents' becomes stressful because there's a power struggle) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nIt's giving me this vibe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement\\_of\\_Solomon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour rationale is amazing, and you've already compassionately put yourselves in their shoes (And you're right, they're going to cherish the quiet moments they have just the two of them.)
