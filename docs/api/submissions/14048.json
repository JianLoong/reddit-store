They go down without a fuss and will often sleep until 7am (which is an absolute dream for the parent of a toddler). We weren't so lucky with our son and he tends to wake up early and will wake up in the middle of the night, especially if not sleeping at home. With daylight saving ending recently, he's waking up even earlier and it's been hard to manage for us and quite stressful. We're currently trying every trick in the book to get him to sleep later.\n\nToday my SIL requested that if our son wakes early this weekend, we'd leave the house immediately  to take him for a walk or a drive until later in the morning when they are all ready the get up.\n\nI refused - I am heavily pregnant and I won't be taking my child out when it's still dark outside. I will obviously keep him quiet, play with his toys calmly and watch a movie on low volume in our bedroom, but you can't realistically except me to leave the house with a toddler in our pyjamas in the wee hours in the morning to keep the place dead quiet. It's not a dog,  it's a young child.\n\nFor extra context, we invited them to share a rental house with us this weekend while the whole family is going away, and are even paying for their share to make sure that we could spend more time together . We have always supported them and happily made every accommodation for their kids (who can be rowdy too, and that's ok) and our door is always open for them to stay with us when visiting from out of town. \n\nThey made similar comments when spending time with us during the holidays and I don't find it a reasonable thing to ask, especially from one parent to another. Kids will be kids, it's just something to expect.  AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for the advice everyone! This was my first time posting on Reddit and didn't expect so many comments. I'll probably stop reading now and move on, she is not worth spending so much mental energy.

I would give them the choice to not come at all if they are so bothered by it.\n\nOr they could always sleep in a tent outside, that way they are also not bothered by your child waking up in the middle of the night.", "NTA\n\nI'm finding words hard for this. Because I don't know on what planet your SIL's request would be less than insanity. I mean do they want to spend time with you or not? If they do then your child comes with you and so does his sleep patterns. I can't even believe that someone would ask you to do this.", "NTA. You are paying for where they are staying.

Be assertive but kind.", "So wait, you are paying for the rental, they know what kind of sleep schedule your child has, they agreed to come and are now making requests of you? There is no scenario I would agree to this. She can bring white noise machines and somehow deal with the uncertainty that happens when you travel with kids and aren't in the controlled environment of your own home. NTA.

It will be easier for you to adjust to kiddo's early bird time, than it would be to get them to sleep later. My youngest woke up between 5-5:30am like clockwork for the first 9yrs of her life. We tried putting her to bed later, being really boring upon waking up, etc, nothing helped. What helped was when we adjusted how we dealt with it.

This is literally insanity even if people wake up from the baby's crying. When I stay with my family members who have children I expect to get woken up every once in awhile. I just spent the week at my sister's house and my 6-year-old niece woke me up like four of the seven nights.

We also got lucky with our son and his sleeping - he goes to bed easily and sleeps solidly when he does so - but he's an early bird.  When he was little, we did what you suggest - one of us would get up with him and keep him quiet.  It's never been a big deal, and we've shared many rental houses on family vacations. \n\nWhen you're doing those kinds of get-togethers, it's entirely unreasonable to suggest that everyone has to cater to others' sleep schedules.  Does she also insist that all adults must go to bed when her children do?", ">  Today my SIL requested that if our son wakes early this weekend, we'd leave the house immediately to take him for a walk or a drive until later in the morning when they are all ready the get up.   \n    \nNTA, the proper response to this is \"I'm sorry to hear you don't wish to host us, we will make other plans for our weekend.\"  And not go.

Respect yourself, no one else will if you don't.   \n     \nEven if your SIL backs down from their demand, at this point, there is no way I would spend a long weekend with them.   \n    \nEDIT: Sorry, I missed this part, I guess I was so caught up in the gall of your SIL, I missed this.\n\n>  For extra context, we invited them to share a rental house with us this weekend while the whole family is going away, and are even paying for their share to make sure that we could spend more time together .

Your kid is your priority and you are doing a great job at keeping him quiet.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou are paying for the accommodations in a shared house. You agreed to be quiet in the bedroom,  which is sufficient.  If you do decide to leave, which may not be  safe that early and dark, them don't go in pajamas. Get a shower. Get dressed for the day. Cook breakfast. Brush teeth. Then go for a walk.", "NTA. That is not a reasonable request at all. If they are setting that as an expectation, staying with them is probably not a good idea any time soon.", "Nta if they are making these demands then it might be time to stop accommodating them and let them pay for their lodgings instead. That way they get the quiet they want and you don't need to be ask to leave your place for them.", "NTA. What the actual fuck was she thinking asking that.", "Exactly! If the noise bothers them, maybe her family can sleep somewhere else.", "I understand early risers my now 9 year old hasn't slept past 5 am since he was born but we're lucky cause he sits there and does his own little thing. However if your child is up at that hour and waking everyone else up that's a problem.

She's a choosing beggar. Ridiculous.", "NTA. You're giving them free housing just to spend time with them and she's demanding you take your kid out of the house that you're renting. As long as the kid is quiet, there's literally no issue.", "So basically they are guests in your rental and making demands that are a bit unreasonable.  Yeah, NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. OP, just respond, \"We understand that our son getting up early doesn't work for your family, so it might be better if you got your own cabin. Please let us know where you're staying and we'll be sure to come visit!\"\n\nIf you're paying for the cabin, her request shows that she's massively entitled. I think it's time your family does less for hers.", "I mean, a lot of parents do take their giddy kids for a walk or drive ... but I don't know why she asked you vs your spouse seeing as how you're pregnant.", "NTA. You're paying for her vacation, and she has the audacity to tell you  that you have to leave the cabin for her comfort? My response would be that if she wants to sleep in, she can pay for her own cabin. Holy entitlement...", "NTA, but tell her that no pay means no say. And she is free to leave if it matters so much.", "Did you really ask you to leave the cabin and take a drive while heavily pregnant just to make certain your child did not wake hers?? Or was she trying to offer suggestions as to what parents try that works for them and this just happened to be one of those tricks?", "NTA! Waking up early and not going back to bed could ruin their sleep schedule, for sure NTA!", "NTA", "NTA. Don't invite them to stay again. Also when you ignore there request and they say something, laugh really hard in their face.", "Duuuuude HARD nta. I have 2 kids, both are guaran-damn-teed to wake up before 5a when we're on the road. We warn whoever we will be sharing space with beforehand every time. Nobody has ever requested something like this. Hold your ground if this becomes drama.", "YTA. So you think it\u2019s reasonable to wake an entire house full of people?", "Right?!", "Um OP is paying for the accommodations, not her SIL. Telling a heavily PREGNANT woman to take a 2 YEAR OLD outside at 4 am is very unreasonable as it can be very unsafe. And 2 year olds don't stay quiet for long, plus her SIL KNOWS that the 2 year old wakes up early and is just being unreasonable. As OP said, this is a child not an animal.", "So asking a HEAVILY PREGNANT woman to go outside in the DARK with a 2 YEAR OLD is reasonable? The SIL KNOWS that the kid wakes early but is basically telling OP to go outside as if her child were a dog. The SIL's kid's are also the same age. She isn't waking an entire house of people, just the kids. Of course the kids are going to wake, their cousin is awake and they want to play. Plus do you know what could happen to a lady and child who are out by themselves in the DARK? Not everyone has good intentions and not everywhere is safe for kids.", "HELLO!!!!!", "I literally said taking the child out at 4 isn't practical LMAO. I am fully aware that young kids don't stay quiet long but it's rude to allow them to wake everyone else up. Again they should have had their own accommodations. SIL couldn't afford the vacation they shouldn't have gone.", "Its not rude when the SIL's kids are the same age. And nowhere does it say that the SIL couldn't afford it, OP says she paid for both accommodations so they could all spend more time together.", "NTA but putting up a blackout blind might help tricking the wee one so you get a wee bit more sleep yourself. Your SIL is ridiculous", "Honestly in her defence that area were staying in is pretty safe so safety isn't really my main concern (maybe I'm naive?). Pregnancy is also beside the point , but definitely makes me a lot less eager to leave the house in early hours of the morning.\n\nHer kids did wake slightly earlier the last time we stayed together because they were excited it was Christmas time and that their cousin was there to play. Whenever their kids would wake earlier I actually looked after them and happily took charge until everyone else would be up to. It's not like I'd go and bang on their door asking to look after their awaken child \ud83d\ude05. \n\nWe've always accommodated any situation the best way possible for their kids because we love them and care about them, but that's just not a reasonable thing to ask IMO. As I said we're talking about a child, not a dog (and I've probably been more accommodating of their dog than they are of my child, ironically enough lol)", "This is unreasonable even without the fact that YOU\u2019RE paying for their share!!! NTA. Kids get rowdy, they wake at weird times. In shared accommodation she needs to roll with it, her needs aren\u2019t above everyone else\u2019s. In shared accom she isn\u2019t paying for?? Madness", "Once it's light out, my kid will wake up to the littlest thing. If nothing wakes him up, he's good until 8am or later. If other kids were waking him up at the crack of dawn, I would probably try to convince OP that since she's already up, she should watch all 3 and let me sleep. Or maybe I would feel bad and offer to watch her kid at 4 am at least one day so that she can sleep. Probably make a schedule and do both. Maximize parental sleep for everyone, rotating days.", "Speaking of green, some people legit have medical sleeping issues. (Definitely not suggesting you dose your child, just to be clear)\n\nHave you talked to your pediatrician? They may have some other suggestions or at least be able to refer you to a sleep specialist.\n\nAlso, for DLS, have you tried blackout shades? In the cabin, you could literally put extra sheets up or something.\n\nGood luck! And congrats on the new babe.", "Op also mentions the kids use a white noise machine. That means they are Not miracle children with sleep", "Some of us have good sleepers. We just keep quiet about it because there's nothing useful that we can share to help other parents. My kid just likes to sleep when it's dark out. He was just born that way. I had to wake him up to eat as a newborn. He's never been ignored or left to cry. Once it is light out, noises will wake him up, much like most humans.", "NTA. \n\nYou paid, you invited them, if your child keeps them up (at no fault of his, he's a toddler for gods sake) then they can go for a drive.", "Bemuffles me to no end, when you arrange and pay for something and then get told what to do....stop paying to be with these people !!!! They sound like expectational ingrates.

Maybe in 5 years when all the kids are older. K bye!\u201d\n\nIf she pesters you, just stay really casual and keep saying, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want to do that. We\u2019ll just stay in our rental at night, thanks.\u201d", "Nope.\n\nNope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope\n\nI am a person who stopped napping at 18 months old. Because I stayed quiet in my crib, my parents didn't exactly pursue treatment (until I was 8 y.o.). \n\nBut even if they had gone sooner, there was literally nothing that could have been done. It's fairly obvious when the cause of childhood sleeplessness is medically correctable. For everyone else, it's like, \"Well, we can try behavioral stuff, but it may or may not work \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\"\n\nDumb to suggest to someone who is obviously in tune to her kid's needs."]}
