We weren't so lucky with our son and he tends to wake up early and will wake up in the middle of the night, especially if not sleeping at home. With daylight saving ending recently, he's waking up even earlier and it's been hard to manage for us and quite stressful. We're currently trying every trick in the book to get him to sleep later.\n\nToday my SIL requested that if our son wakes early this weekend, we'd leave the house immediately  to take him for a walk or a drive until later in the morning when they are all ready the get up.\n\nI refused - I am heavily pregnant and I won't be taking my child out when it's still dark outside. I will obviously keep him quiet, play with his toys calmly and watch a movie on low volume in our bedroom, but you can't realistically except me to leave the house with a toddler in our pyjamas in the wee hours in the morning to keep the place dead quiet. It's not a dog,  it's a young child.\n\nFor extra context, we invited them to share a rental house with us this weekend while the whole family is going away, and are even paying for their share to make sure that we could spend more time together . We have always supported them and happily made every accommodation for their kids (who can be rowdy too, and that's ok) and our door is always open for them to stay with us when visiting from out of town. \n\nThey made similar comments when spending time with us during the holidays and I don't find it a reasonable thing to ask, especially from one parent to another.
