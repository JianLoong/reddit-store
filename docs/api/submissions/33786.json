They are recently married and their wedding has caused some tension in my family.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I work in the securities industry, and work gets very hectic for us in the first few weeks of each quarter. I love my family of course but it\u2019s been an unspoken rule with us that for those few weeks I\u2019m always working and always busy so it\u2019s best to plan around me, so to speak. Eve and my son planned their wedding for *October 20th*. Smack dab in the middle of my busiest season.\n\nI was disappointed in my son and told him to change the date if possible so that I could attend more easily. He said they had already booked the venue and in all honesty I was disappointed in him, I expected some kind of say in the decision or at least a heads up.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and it\u2019s the week before the wedding, I inform my son that I unfortunately won\u2019t be able to stay for the whole wedding. I tell him (honestly) that I\u2019d love to stay for the ceremony but that with work and all I won\u2019t be able to stay for the reception. To say he flipped his lid would be an understatement.\n\nHe asked if I was seriously planning to skip his wedding. I corrected him and told him that I would only be skipping the reception- aka the party. He said it was still his wedding and that he wanted me to be there. I told him I understood but he knows how busy I get around that time and that he should have known this was a possibility when he booked the venue. He said \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d and I took this as his acceptance.\n\nThe wedding was great and I heard the party was fun. Fast forward until now and my son has been deliberately ignoring me or being short with me whenever we talk and I obviously attribute this to his feelings about my actions. I asked him about this the other day and he asked me if I really expect him to not be upset with me after \u201cskipping the wedding\u201d. I pointed out that he told me to do whatever I want, and then I did, and that I\u2019d be within my rights to actually skip the wedding based on his comments. He\u2019s completely ignoring me now. I talked to my wife about it and she got extremely angry as well, telling me that she thinks he\u2019s right and that I royally messed up. What do you all think? AITA here or are they overreacting over something they knew would happen?", "created_utc": 1703606803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rbdej/aita_for_not_being_able_to_stay_at_my_sons_wedding/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Usually when people have excessively demanding work, the idea is NOT to plan around them lol whereas you seem to expect the opposite. I think your resentment at not having 'some kind of say in the decision' caused you to purposefully - but perhaps subconsciously - prioritize work in order to make a point.

They are recently married and their wedding has caused some tension in my family.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I work in the securities industry, and work gets very hectic for us in the first few weeks of each quarter. I love my family of course but it\u2019s been an unspoken rule with us that for those few weeks I\u2019m always working and always busy so it\u2019s best to plan around me, so to speak. Eve and my son planned their wedding for *October 20th*. Smack dab in the middle of my busiest season.\n\nI was disappointed in my son and told him to change the date if possible so that I could attend more easily. He said they had already booked the venue and in all honesty I was disappointed in him, I expected some kind of say in the decision or at least a heads up.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and it\u2019s the week before the wedding, I inform my son that I unfortunately won\u2019t be able to stay for the whole wedding. I tell him (honestly) that I\u2019d love to stay for the ceremony but that with work and all I won\u2019t be able to stay for the reception. To say he flipped his lid would be an understatement.\n\nHe asked if I was seriously planning to skip his wedding. I corrected him and told him that I would only be skipping the reception- aka the party. He said it was still his wedding and that he wanted me to be there. I told him I understood but he knows how busy I get around that time and that he should have known this was a possibility when he booked the venue. He said \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d and I took this as his acceptance.\n\nThe wedding was great and I heard the party was fun. Fast forward until now and my son has been deliberately ignoring me or being short with me whenever we talk and I obviously attribute this to his feelings about my actions. I asked him about this the other day and he asked me if I really expect him to not be upset with me after \u201cskipping the wedding\u201d. I pointed out that he told me to do whatever I want, and then I did, and that I\u2019d be within my rights to actually skip the wedding based on his comments. He\u2019s completely ignoring me now. I talked to my wife about it and she got extremely angry as well, telling me that she thinks he\u2019s right and that I royally messed up. What do you all think? AITA here or are they overreacting over something they knew would happen?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's too much for you to do for your child's wedding?", "I\u2019m sure there are hundred of tax preparer parents who would take one day off during busy tax season to attend their child\u2019s wedding.", "I have that at my job, but weddings are an exception.", "Right. But seeing as OP admits to needing a heads up I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case here.", "Sounds like you are also an asshole in this. No job is so important that you can't take a day off for a wedding.", "Let's say they did put it in your busy period though - would you honestly prioritise work over your sister's wedding like this so called father did to his son", "Yeah it really feels like this guy believes he is much more important and central to his family than the rest of his family do. I wonder if he understands that they exist outside of when they interact with him?", "Probably not the first time OP put his job over his kid.", "I just read one of his replies to a comment that voted him n-t-a where he said it was a \"concession\" for him to even be at the wedding at all.  \n\nI went back and re-read the post where he says he's busy for a few weeks every quarter.  So if we say that a few = 3 weeks and there are 4 quarters in a year, then OP is \"busy\" for 3 months out of the year.  That's a lot of MIA time to accommodate.  And he says he's been doing this since his kids were born.  \n\nWhen the son said \"do whatever you want\" it was likely because the son knew that OP would choose work and he knew that because OP has done it before.\n\nSo with all that in mind, and your excellent point about waitlists for venues, caterers, etc., I'm going YTA.  \n\nI think OP is one of those people who likes to pretend that nothing can be done without them and that belief has been their priority over their family time after time, so much so, that to attend their child's wedding is a concession to their child.", "Slightly disagree. If the couple have people that must absolutely be there, they should start searching with a calendar of when those people are available. And if they end up with a day that doesn\u2019t work for one of the important people, the couple let them know as soon as possible, so the guest can see if there is wiggle room in their schedule. \n\nLike taking a damn day off, OP!", "This, not to mention...weddings are planned MONTHS in advance. OP had plenty of warning to figure out how to attend, even if it was busy season. OP's lack of planning themselves is what got them in this situation.", "Assuming OP is correct on the dates, and it happened this year, that would have been a Friday.", "And probably not even the whole day! He could have gotten up early and worked and then taken off for the wedding and reception. \n\nI would understand more if it was a destination wedding and required multiple days, but this sounds like something where you could work extra on the surrounding days and be fine (said by someone in an industry where we also have extreme crunch time and things on the schedule where I couldn\u2019t take time off).", "It's not about how important the job is, it's about the balancing of workload. My work has 50 weeks a year when staff can select their annual leave. OP's job has ~40 weeks a year they can take off. If you are doing into an industry with this sort of restrictions, it's not a surprise. \n\nIt's also not uncommon - I know plenty of doctors, nurses, soldiers, teachers, etc who are flat out told when they can take holiday, not just when they can't. \n\nIt is rank naivete to think that every job allows you to dictate exactly when you get to be off.", "I guarantee op has used their job as an excuse to slide out of graduation ceremonies, school events and other milestones for YEARS and assumed the same could be acceptable for the wedding.", "I'll bet that OP has missed a lot of his son's life if he was willing to half-ass attend the wedding."]}
