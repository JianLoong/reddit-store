Alice is a full time college student, but works at a fast food place on the weekends. She received a scholarship to her college that cover most costs, and we pay the rest. Me and Tom own our apartment, we also own a second apartment that we let Alice live in, so she doesn't have to worry about rent and can focus on her studies.\n\nTom's sister has a daughter 'Rose' (21). Her parents live in a different state but she moved here for college, not the same as Alice, a significantly more expensive one. Rose recently ran into some troubles and struggling to pay for her housing. Rose, as well as my SIL, asked if she could room with Alice for a little while while she saves up. We've talked to Alice and she's fine having Rose stay with her.\n\nTom is insisting we let Rose stay for free, but I think she should pay rent. Rose said she'd cover utilities and food, and he's insisting that's more than enough and we should help her out. I replied that we are helping her out by giving her a place to stay, and the rent would be less than market rent. Tom said by that logic we should be charging Alice the same rent as well, but I think that's completely different, but he said I'm being selfish.", "created_utc": 1667210490, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi6xqq/aita_for_wanting_to_charge_my_niece_rent_while/", "score": 3025, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's struggling financially then a below market rent place is better than somewhere else. Y'all are all assholes not her. It isn't her job to help someone else out regardless of their struggles and she's still offering to help, rent is wild currently so a below market rent is amazing to offer. Keep in mind, is this her property, yes, then yeah, if someone moves in who isn't her literal daughter, they should pay rent. Y'all's families may work like that but not all do. Plus you're acting like she's not helping at all. Rose can save more than she could before with a below market rent. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Alice is a full time college student, but works at a fast food place on the weekends. She received a scholarship to her college that cover most costs, and we pay the rest. Me and Tom own our apartment, we also own a second apartment that we let Alice live in, so she doesn't have to worry about rent and can focus on her studies.\n\nTom's sister has a daughter 'Rose' (21). Her parents live in a different state but she moved here for college, not the same as Alice, a significantly more expensive one. Rose recently ran into some troubles and struggling to pay for her housing. Rose, as well as my SIL, asked if she could room with Alice for a little while while she saves up. We've talked to Alice and she's fine having Rose stay with her.\n\nTom is insisting we let Rose stay for free, but I think she should pay rent. Rose said she'd cover utilities and food, and he's insisting that's more than enough and we should help her out. I replied that we are helping her out by giving her a place to stay, and the rent would be less than market rent. Tom said by that logic we should be charging Alice the same rent as well, but I think that's completely different, but he said I'm being selfish.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is absolutely no justification for charging your niece rent if she is going to pay her share of costs for utilities and food.

Is that why you want rent from just her? Because she's not blood related to you specifically?\n\nThis is definitely giving your daughter special treatment (which is fair to a point because she is your daughter), but your husband is right about your logic for why you should charge Rose rent.

Not that that matters currently.\n\nLook, by your own assessment, I think you are being selfish and greedy. If you know Rose is already struggling financially, why put the squeeze on her even more?

At the end of the 3 months you have her start paying rent for the remainder of the time she stays in the apartment.
