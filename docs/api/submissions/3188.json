However recently I think Lily really overstepped and acted inappropriately.\n\nLast week, Alice's school had a fair. There was games, prizes, food and music. Alice is in her school's dance club which was doing a performance towards the end of the fair.\n\nI talked to Rachel about the event, and we agreed that I would take Alice to the fair and Rachel would meet up with us at the event then take Alice back to her home.\n\nLily insisted on accompanying me and Alice to the fair and I didn't see a reason as to why she couldn't come along. However, Rachel didn't meet us when she agreed to. I tried to call her a few times but she wasn't answering.\n\nLily seemed a lot more annoyed about it than I was, and went on about how Rachel shouldn't be late and that she needs to prioritise her time better. I told Lily she's probably just stuck in traffic or something and that it's no big deal.\n\nRachel ended up being 2 hours late, and didn't arrive until after the dance performance. She said that her boss made her stay behind past the time she was supposed to finish and was really apologetic. Rachel is not normally late.\n\nI will admit that Alice was pretty disappointed, but these things happen. Lily was fuming angry, and confronted Rachel in front of Alice. She accused Rachel of not caring about her child and being hopelessly disorganised. Lily told Rachel that her own mother was like her and that she hates her for it.\n\nI tried to calm Lily down and prevent an argument but Rachel started yelling at Lily and said that she has no right to criticise her, and that she's not Alice's parent.\n\nThey got into a screaming match and caused a huge scene. Alice started crying and Rachel eventually took Alice to her car and left.\n\nI took Lily home but I was really angry with her. I talked to Lily the next day when she was more calm and told her that she majorly overstepped her bounds, and that she owes Rachel an apology. Lily seemed surprised that I'd say that and said that Rachel was blatantly in the wrong and that she should've been more organised and prioritised her child.\n\nI told Lily that doesn't matter and that she behaved inappropriately.

Your current gf sounds emotionally unstable, her comment comparing Rachel to her own mother says it all.", "NTA. Lily took it upon herself to judge both you and Rachel for your parenting. Regardless of whether anyone did anything wrong here, if Lily felt the need to vent about Rachel the appropriate time would have been to *you* only, not directly to Rachel, and most definitely not in front of Alice. She discusses her problems with you, you handle the relationship between your ex and you.\n\nI see a lot of \"why didn't Rachel answer her phone\". As someone who works in a safety critical environment and doesn't have their phone on them, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibilities for me to be 1-2 hours late leaving work with no notice. I'm sure Rachel didn't *want* to miss her daughter's dance, then having some woman berate you for it would suck.", "NTA, but you will be if you continue to date Lily if she doesn't apologize promptly to your ex and your daughter. \n\nSounds like Lily had a parent too disorganized to make it to her events and she's projecting. She just made her issues a problem for your ex and your daughter. Lily was totally out of line here.

That all three happened is simply unacceptable.\n\nI have no business judging your GF's motivations, but if I were you, I'd start looking for trends.  Is she oversensitive to the needs of your child in general?  Does she only get riled when your ex is involved?  Does she have a tendency to spotlight herself in situations that have nothing to do with her?  Answering these questions may help determine whether your GF is coming from a place of love, a place of malice, or is just attention-seeking.\n\nIn any event, you were absolutely right for calling her out on her behavior.

I was on Rachel\u2019s side until she let Lily\u2019s confrontation get to her and it escalated. That said, while she handled herself poorly she makes very valid points. Anything Lily wanted to say to Rachel should have been (a) in private and (b) not in front of Alice. (ETA: I\u2019m still on Rachel\u2019s side overall; I don\u2019t like how I phrased this paragraph, but I\u2019m too tired to figure out a better way to word things.)\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re NTA and honestly this seems to have very little to do with you.", "NTA, but if Lily is this much of a drama llama this early into the relationship\u2026.RUN because this is the tip of the iceberg.

Lily is trying to feel more important that she actually is. She sounds immature BUT your ex could have at least sent a text. I can't imagine her not being able to find 60 seconds to let you know what was going on. So that DOES sound selfish. You need to pick  better partners and don't get Lily pregnant. They're  both wrong and this is supposed to be about Alice but Lily  stole the show smh.", "NTA. Holy crap, your girlfriend massively overstep here. I get being annoyed with the lateness and not telling you, but to blow up like she did, in front of your daughter? No. That\u2019s not the done thing. \n\nIf Rachel is not normally late and feeling the pressure from work, the last thing she needs to hear is that she isn\u2019t prioritising her child, I would have a chat with her and ask if everything is ok, does she need you to do a bit more in terms of childcare etc.\n\nLily sounds very immature and needs to be dumped.

She hashed out her childhood issues on your ex and your child, and she had a argument with your ex in a deeply inappropriate manner and place. \n\nShe needs to learn how to be an adult and to identify the difference between her trauma and the reality of your child\u2019s situation. If she can\u2019t, she\u2019s not someone who\u2019s safe to be around your kid.", "NTA. Your primary allegiance has to be with your daughter and your former partner, because she is the mother of your child. Your current gf, Whatever her trauma is? That's got nothing to do with your family. It's very clear that she overstepped and caused harm. \n\nYou need to be clear and firm w/her why she cannot do things like this. I'm sure she thought she was defending your kid and you. But you have to be a very strong person in a moment like this. Know your values. Defend them from all comers. Move forward.", "NTA. Rachel was genuinely apologetic, and unfortunately work things do happen. Plus she knew her dad was there at least so she probably wasn\u2019t panicked or anything. Lily overstepped.", "NTA. Lily needs to stay in her own lane, she barley knows you at 8 months, let alone your daughter or her mother. This is a red flag, OP, why does she feel entitled to speak to Rachel in such an appalling way and why is she trying to assert herself as some kind of step mother figure after just 8 months?\n\nAlso, a tip, this is why you don't introduce partners to your kids until you're passed the one year mark. As a kid who grew up knowing many \"aunties\" and \"uncles\" coming in and out of my life, I can tell you it will damage your relationship with your child eventually. Don't introduce until it's serious and you can trust the person not to pull any weird stunts like this.", "NTA for telling her she acted inappropriately (which she certainly did) but a couple things stood out to me. For one, the fact that your main concern was that your girlfriend apologize to your ex. Yes her behavior was unacceptable and that definitely warrants a conversation between the two of you regarding boundaries and an apology to your daughter, who innocently got stuck in the middle of adult drama. And sure, the mature thing to do would be for your girlfriend to recognize where she messed up, but your ex is hardly the victim in this situation and your girlfriend may be unable to own up to her mistake if she feels like your only concern is how this interaction negatively impacted your ex. Secondly, you say she \"insisted\" on accompanying you to the event and you saw no reason she couldn't come along. This wording makes it sound like her presence was not particularly welcome, but tolerated because there wasn't a good reason not to allow it. This vibe, accompanied with your great co-parenting relationship with your ex might make your girlfriend feel like the third wheel to you and your ex rather than your partner in her own relationship. Perhaps she is trying to find where exactly she belongs in this relationship and when it seems there's no space as your partner, she subconsciously steps in as protector of your daughter whilst projecting her own issues with her mother onto your ex. \n\nIt sounds like you might want to have a talk with your girlfriend about what her role is and what it isn't in this relationship and in regards to your daughter. Perhaps she should not attend your daughter's events if she has to insist upon being included in the first place. As far as your ex goes, I don't think telling her she needs to apologize is the way to go. For one thing, they are both adults and thus capable (or should be capable) of navigating this conflict without you mediating. If you want to maintain your good co-parenting relationship and your relationship with your girlfriend, your best bet would be to let your girlfriend know it is unacceptable to make a scene in front of your daughter. Period. The details can be worked out once that part is made very clear. Then provide a general apology to your ex for how the night went without going into the details, which ultimately are not your responsibility to address. Girlfriend and co-parent are not a naturally harmonious duo, thus having clear boundaries in place can help mitigate the worst of the misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Mostly, if they can't get along without your intervention, they shouldn't be participating in family activities together, regardless of whose fault it was.", "you are NTA, but both your ex and your current gf are huge a-holes. the moment your ex knew she had to work late, she should have texted. your current gf is also an a-hole for making a public scene. it's not just possible, but it is in fact PROBABLE that your ex's boss knew she had an event with your daughter and deliberately made her work over out of some power play. especially if she works in retail or in any place with really petty, power tripping jerks. she has a child so she can't just quit easily over petty mistreatments like that. you yourself said your ex was never late before, so it's not like this is a common thing that happens with her. remind your current gf of that. it's the first time she's been late. if it happens once or twice a year it's no big deal. \n\nyour GF shoudln't have even confronted her about it unless it was an established pattern. now she's set a precedent that can impact YOU. what happens when the situation is turned around and YOU are the one that's late? she's just given your ex a blank check to go off on you over little shit.", "Really inappropriate.

Because I surely don't.\n\nLily's reaction? Really? She already knows that you and Rachel are working at co-parenting, which, makes her the third wheel. So, while I can understand that, her reaction to Rachel missing the performance was just over the top. Let's toss on top of it that she expected you to take her side because you're dating. \n\nThe only person that got hurt? Alice.

I never said a bad word about my son's father until he was almost an adult and was being emotionally abused. I also had a stepdaughter for 5 years and the same applies. Despite losing contact with her for several years she sought me out when she was old enough and is part of our family. Both her and my son would rather spend time with me than their respective fathers. Showing your children love always works better than being a dick about the other parent", "I agree about nuclear offense, and I\u2019m guessing gf doesn\u2019t like the amicable relationship ex has with OP and feels threatened by it.  Like, what if they get back together?  I\u2019m guessing she pounced on an \u201copportunity \u201c to get you to not respect the mom, maybe to hate her.  To drive a wedge like that is relationship security for gf. \n\n\ud83d\udea9this will not be the end of this unless you make it the end.  You and ex have learned to handle it like mature adults and you deserve a partner who is on board with that.", "I agree mostly, but I wouldn't say give upon the relationship based solely on this. I'd have a talk with her about how you can see how her mother having a pattern of this behavior has rightly caused her to be sensitive to this problem with missing events for a child, but your Ex does not have a pattern of behavior in missing/being late for your child. But most importantly a stepparent has absolutely no right to be involved in a child's rearing period (let alone a future stepparent) unless both parents allow it.  \n\nNow if this is her only or rare faux pax, I would keep the relationship if she agrees to leave the parenting to each parent. If not, either keep her on a chain or drop her as this is a big marinara flag.\n\nNTA at all!!!!!", "Yes she should have. It\u2019s one thing to be 10 minutes late but she was 2 hours late. She should have went to the boss and said I need to use my phone to let my ex why I\u2019m not there.", "Exactly this! It was not the mum's fault, she had to still put food on the table. Sometimes things happen", "I only disagree in that Rachel yelled right back; idelaly she would have turned to OP and been like, \u201cHandle her,\u201d and removed Alice from the situation ASAP rather than escalating. But I do understand that amygdalas kick in and Lily lit this fuse.", "That\u2019s WHY she couldn\u2019t answer when OP called", "My dad's job was like that. But they had payphones and we had a phone number to call to reach him. No parent should be unavailable.", "Sadly, yes. And when I say \u201che can\u2019t\u201d I really mean it\u2019s completely unreasonable and ethically wrong. In many jobs, the manager indeed can require this."]}
