However recently I think Lily really overstepped and acted inappropriately.\n\nLast week, Alice's school had a fair. There was games, prizes, food and music. Alice is in her school's dance club which was doing a performance towards the end of the fair.\n\nI talked to Rachel about the event, and we agreed that I would take Alice to the fair and Rachel would meet up with us at the event then take Alice back to her home.\n\nLily insisted on accompanying me and Alice to the fair and I didn't see a reason as to why she couldn't come along. However, Rachel didn't meet us when she agreed to. I tried to call her a few times but she wasn't answering.\n\nLily seemed a lot more annoyed about it than I was, and went on about how Rachel shouldn't be late and that she needs to prioritise her time better. I told Lily she's probably just stuck in traffic or something and that it's no big deal.\n\nRachel ended up being 2 hours late, and didn't arrive until after the dance performance. She said that her boss made her stay behind past the time she was supposed to finish and was really apologetic. Rachel is not normally late.\n\nI will admit that Alice was pretty disappointed, but these things happen. Lily was fuming angry, and confronted Rachel in front of Alice. She accused Rachel of not caring about her child and being hopelessly disorganised. Lily told Rachel that her own mother was like her and that she hates her for it.\n\nI tried to calm Lily down and prevent an argument but Rachel started yelling at Lily and said that she has no right to criticise her, and that she's not Alice's parent.\n\nThey got into a screaming match and caused a huge scene. Alice started crying and Rachel eventually took Alice to her car and left.\n\nI took Lily home but I was really angry with her. I talked to Lily the next day when she was more calm and told her that she majorly overstepped her bounds, and that she owes Rachel an apology. Lily seemed surprised that I'd say that and said that Rachel was blatantly in the wrong and that she should've been more organised and prioritised her child.\n\nI told Lily that doesn't matter and that she behaved inappropriately.

Honestly, I don't know if I could show my face around your daughter's friends' parents with Lily in tow for awhile. The gossip and side-eye is going to be heavy.

Your current gf sounds emotionally unstable, her comment comparing Rachel to her own mother says it all.", "NTA. Lily took it upon herself to judge both you and Rachel for your parenting.

She discusses her problems with you, you handle the relationship between your ex and you.\n\nI see a lot of \"why didn't Rachel answer her phone\". As someone who works in a safety critical environment and doesn't have their phone on them, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibilities for me to be 1-2 hours late leaving work with no notice. I'm sure Rachel didn't *want* to miss her daughter's dance, then having some woman berate you for it would suck.", "NTA, but you will be if you continue to date Lily if she doesn't apologize promptly to your ex and your daughter. \n\nSounds like Lily had a parent too disorganized to make it to her events and she's projecting. She just made her issues a problem for your ex and your daughter. Lily was totally out of line here.

That all three happened is simply unacceptable.\n\nI have no business judging your GF's motivations, but if I were you, I'd start looking for trends.  Is she oversensitive to the needs of your child in general?  Does she only get riled when your ex is involved?  Does she have a tendency to spotlight herself in situations that have nothing to do with her?  Answering these questions may help determine whether your GF is coming from a place of love, a place of malice, or is just attention-seeking.\n\nIn any event, you were absolutely right for calling her out on her behavior.

I was on Rachel\u2019s side until she let Lily\u2019s confrontation get to her and it escalated. That said, while she handled herself poorly she makes very valid points. Anything Lily wanted to say to Rachel should have been (a) in private and (b) not in front of Alice. (ETA: I\u2019m still on Rachel\u2019s side overall; I don\u2019t like how I phrased this paragraph, but I\u2019m too tired to figure out a better way to word things.)\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re NTA and honestly this seems to have very little to do with you.", "NTA, but if Lily is this much of a drama llama this early into the relationship\u2026.RUN because this is the tip of the iceberg.

Lily is trying to feel more important that she actually is. She sounds immature BUT your ex could have at least sent a text. I can't imagine her not being able to find 60 seconds to let you know what was going on. So that DOES sound selfish. You need to pick  better partners and don't get Lily pregnant. They're  both wrong and this is supposed to be about Alice but Lily  stole the show smh.", "NTA. Holy crap, your girlfriend massively overstep here. I get being annoyed with the lateness and not telling you, but to blow up like she did, in front of your daughter? No. That\u2019s not the done thing. \n\nIf Rachel is not normally late and feeling the pressure from work, the last thing she needs to hear is that she isn\u2019t prioritising her child, I would have a chat with her and ask if everything is ok, does she need you to do a bit more in terms of childcare etc.\n\nLily sounds very immature and needs to be dumped.

She hashed out her childhood issues on your ex and your child, and she had a argument with your ex in a deeply inappropriate manner and place. \n\nShe needs to learn how to be an adult and to identify the difference between her trauma and the reality of your child\u2019s situation. If she can\u2019t, she\u2019s not someone who\u2019s safe to be around your kid.", "NTA. Your primary allegiance has to be with your daughter and your former partner, because she is the mother of your child. Your current gf, Whatever her trauma is? That's got nothing to do with your family. It's very clear that she overstepped and caused harm. \n\nYou need to be clear and firm w/her why she cannot do things like this. I'm sure she thought she was defending your kid and you. But you have to be a very strong person in a moment like this. Know your values. Defend them from all comers. Move forward.", "NTA. Rachel was genuinely apologetic, and unfortunately work things do happen. Plus she knew her dad was there at least so she probably wasn\u2019t panicked or anything. Lily overstepped.", "NTA. Lily needs to stay in her own lane, she barley knows you at 8 months, let alone your daughter or her mother. This is a red flag, OP, why does she feel entitled to speak to Rachel in such an appalling way and why is she trying to assert herself as some kind of step mother figure after just 8 months?\n\nAlso, a tip, this is why you don't introduce partners to your kids until you're passed the one year mark. As a kid who grew up knowing many \"aunties\" and \"uncles\" coming in and out of my life, I can tell you it will damage your relationship with your child eventually. Don't introduce until it's serious and you can trust the person not to pull any weird stunts like this.", "NTA for telling her she acted inappropriately (which she certainly did) but a couple things stood out to me. For one, the fact that your main concern was that your girlfriend apologize to your ex. Yes her behavior was unacceptable and that definitely warrants a conversation between the two of you regarding boundaries and an apology to your daughter, who innocently got stuck in the middle of adult drama. And sure, the mature thing to do would be for your girlfriend to recognize where she messed up, but your ex is hardly the victim in this situation and your girlfriend may be unable to own up to her mistake if she feels like your only concern is how this interaction negatively impacted your ex. Secondly, you say she \"insisted\" on accompanying you to the event and you saw no reason she couldn't come along. This wording makes it sound like her presence was not particularly welcome, but tolerated because there wasn't a good reason not to allow it. This vibe, accompanied with your great co-parenting relationship with your ex might make your girlfriend feel like the third wheel to you and your ex rather than your partner in her own relationship. Perhaps she is trying to find where exactly she belongs in this relationship and when it seems there's no space as your partner, she subconsciously steps in as protector of your daughter whilst projecting her own issues with her mother onto your ex. \n\nIt sounds like you might want to have a talk with your girlfriend about what her role is and what it isn't in this relationship and in regards to your daughter. Perhaps she should not attend your daughter's events if she has to insist upon being included in the first place. As far as your ex goes, I don't think telling her she needs to apologize is the way to go. For one thing, they are both adults and thus capable (or should be capable) of navigating this conflict without you mediating. If you want to maintain your good co-parenting relationship and your relationship with your girlfriend, your best bet would be to let your girlfriend know it is unacceptable to make a scene in front of your daughter. Period. The details can be worked out once that part is made very clear. Then provide a general apology to your ex for how the night went without going into the details, which ultimately are not your responsibility to address. Girlfriend and co-parent are not a naturally harmonious duo, thus having clear boundaries in place can help mitigate the worst of the misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Mostly, if they can't get along without your intervention, they shouldn't be participating in family activities together, regardless of whose fault it was.", "you are NTA, but both your ex and your current gf are huge a-holes. the moment your ex knew she had to work late, she should have texted. your current gf is also an a-hole for making a public scene. it's not just possible, but it is in fact PROBABLE that your ex's boss knew she had an event with your daughter and deliberately made her work over out of some power play. especially if she works in retail or in any place with really petty, power tripping jerks. she has a child so she can't just quit easily over petty mistreatments like that. you yourself said your ex was never late before, so it's not like this is a common thing that happens with her. remind your current gf of that. it's the first time she's been late. if it happens once or twice a year it's no big deal. \n\nyour GF shoudln't have even confronted her about it unless it was an established pattern. now she's set a precedent that can impact YOU. what happens when the situation is turned around and YOU are the one that's late? she's just given your ex a blank check to go off on you over little shit.", "Really inappropriate.

Because I surely don't.\n\nLily's reaction? Really? She already knows that you and Rachel are working at co-parenting, which, makes her the third wheel.

Let's toss on top of it that she expected you to take her side because you're dating. \n\nThe only person that got hurt? Alice.

If people didn't know about her parents being divorced, they certainly do now.", "NTA. It sounds like Lily has unresolved trauma from her childhood about how her mom raised her and she's projecting it onto your daughter and taking it out on your ex. If this was me I'd keep the girlfriend away from the child until the girlfriend could demonstrate self-awareness and improvement via therapy, and I would insist that the girlfriend make a full apology to the ex. My girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge her wrongdoing and get help would likely be a dealbreaker for me; I would not want someone this unaware and unstable around my kid.\n\nETA: going forward I would be a lot more careful about who I brought around my kids.

There's more but those hurt me the worst. I have never criticized their mom around them ever. They are kids and I will not put them in that position. \n\nYour girlfriend is way out of line. You and your ex have a great coparenting relationship from what it sounds like.

She had no right whatsoever to interfere and speak to Rachel like that and in front of Alice too.", "NTA. Dump this woman. You are very new into it and this will be your future. Where you messed up is letting your very short term gf come to a school event that was for your child and PARENTS. Your child\u2019s mother now hates your gf. You need to break up. Your gf is out of control and none of it was her business.", "NTA.", "Oh. My. Gosh. \n\nNTA \n\nWhat she did was simply wrong on every level. She took her own childhood experiences and applied it to your daughter. It wasn\u2019t even applicable; your ex is not normally late nor disorganized. What a train wreck. \n\nShe honestly could use therapy.", "OK, I am going to urge you to approach the situation with grace, because I am very much like Lily. My mother was always late or didn't come to school things, because my sister and I were never as important as her job. We went to a private school with the children of very wealthy people, and many of our classmates' mothers were stay at home parents who were always available for daytime events, and ours couldn't prioritize us. Plus, she was a doctor. It would have been easy to block off hours to not see patients when we had an event. She didn't. It hurt. A lot.\n\nSo while Lily was an AH for a lot of reasons (it's not her kid, she's not even a stepmom, she shouldn't have yelled in general, she shouldn't have brought this up in front of Alice) I can see her being triggered. I can see her wanting to discuss with you whether Rachel always misses Alice's events or if this is a one off. I can see her discussing her childhood and urging Rachel to prioritize Alice.\n\nIf you don't want to dump Lily over this, I think you need some rules. First of all, she needs therapy to deal with these issues in her childhood, and likely others, because I know that wasn't the only way my mother hurt me, and she likely has some other crap to deal with as well. \n\n(Since Lily doesn't have any children of her own, this could be the first time that she has ever had a parental level of love for a child. A lot of people who have suffered childhood trauma and have not dealt with it properly, but buried it and coped, have that trauma re-emerge powerfully when they first become parents. Dealing with Alice, loving Alice, wanting to protect and nurture Alice, is likely bringing up all of these old issues. This is actually a good sign if you intend to continue this relationship, because she will never be a stepparent who doesn't want you to prioritize your child.) \n\nThen she needs to apologize to you, and also to especially to Rachel and to Alice. She should Explain calmly about how her mother's behavior affected her. She should say that because she loves Alice, she saw this one off event as Rachel acting like her mother. That this is her issue, and she is going to be dealing with this in therapy. That she was wrong and cruel, and that she hopes both of them understand that she let her trauma take over because she cares so much about Alice. She has to promise though that while she loves Alice, she understands that Rachel and you are Alice's parents, and that her relationship with Alice will always take a backseat to that.\n\nBut, you need to watch for future similar behavior. I personally would give her one chance to correct herself. But I also know that trauma like this can take years to recover from, and ultimately she may not be able to get to a place where she can be have a healthy relationship with Alice quickly enough. Alice deserves to have a life unaffected by Lily's trauma.", "NTA, but this is a hill to die on.\n\nLily is not your fianc\u00e9, she is not your wife. She is your girlfriend of less than a year. She is not even remotely close to being Alice's stepmother yet.\n\nTalk to her again and ask why this upset her so much. Does she have past trauma of a parent breaking promise of no showing?  Point out to her that you understand this must have been distressing for her as a kid, but this isn't Alice's experience. That Rachel is never this late, and this was a one off demand of her boss that she had no choice but to meet. \n\nThen stress that she is not Alice's co-parent, you are. That what she did caused a scene that upset Alice deeply because she attacked her mom. That she needs to apologize to Alice and Rachel and in the future, if she has concerns, she needs to raise them privately to you. And if she can't do that, or she isn't willing to apologize, that you need to rethink the relationship.", "NTA\nNot her kid not her business", "NTA and if your girlfriend cannot understand why she was majorly wrong to do what she did, that is an indicator of serious emotional immaturity amd likely selfishness as well.", "Rachel apparently does not own a cell phone with which she could have called and explained the situation and thus avoided all this anger.  Your ex is the problem.", "NTA but I would suggest talking to Lily and find out what her problem is with your ex. Lily probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with exes being able to still work together and be friendly, so my bet is she thinks the way to show love and support to you, is to defend you against any slights. \n\nYour ex being so late probably seemed like a huge offense to Lily who felt she was in the right to defend you as such. This would also explain why she felt you should apologize.\n\nWas this right on her part? No absolutely not and you need to explain you are still a team with your ex, and you expect her to treat Rachel like she\u2019s part of the team, not an outsider. \n\nIf Lily can\u2019t get on board with apologizing, both to Rachel AND Alice, and treating Rachel like a valued person in Alice\u2019s life, and a human who unfortunately makes mistakes sometimes, then she needs to go. \n\nAlice deserves to have two parents who treat her and each other with respect. If Lily can\u2019t grow up, she needs to be out of the picture.", "NTA unless you continue to allow Lily anywhere near your daughter. What the hell decent parent even allows someone who hasn't even known the child a year into her school activities anyways??? That was a very poor decision think about how things will now be for your daughter at school, because you know EVERYONE there will be talking about it now... Her words are so red their screaming.

Please don't let her continue to mistreat your daughter.", "NTA. It's not your girlfriend's place to criticize your ex about being late for your daughter's school event. You're the one who could do that-- diplomatically and calmly--  IF the situation warranted it, and this one clearly didn't. Rachel's reason was completely valid and it was not an issue of her being disorganized or not prioritizing her child. She knew you, Alice's father, was there and that all was well with her kid. Sounds like Lily lost it because of problems with her own mother, but that doesn't give her the right to go off on another mother, especially as your girl friend. The whole situation has really nothing to do with Lily at all.", "I hope you mean ex girlfriend. She\u2019s very opinionated and lacks empathy and common sense.

Do not let her create friction in your great relationship with your ex. I had to deal with that as a teen and it was not healthy for me. Keep being the good father and man.", "NTA  for telling your girlfriend that but, YWBTA if you stay with Lily. \n\n>Rachel started yelling at Lily and said that she has no right to criticise her, and that she's not Alice's parent.\n\nShe's right.

Time for some serious introspection into your relationship with her.", "NTA - you're gf is a psycho.", "NTA. Your gf was WAY out of line.  I am a mom and I was a stepmother and I would NEVER berate another parent, especially in front of their child or any child. Good grief. GF owes Alice and Rachel both a huge apology.  She made your daughter cry by even saying anything to Rachel. So far out of line I'm furious for your daughter & your ex! Lily needs to know that Lily's issues are NOT anyone else's issues but hers. Lily is making this all about HER and it has nothing to do with her!  Just be grateful there was no emergency and that nothing had happened to Rachel. I would have felt relief, esp if you couldn't reach her by phone or text. Anyway, you are nowhere near an AH in this situation,  but I would point out that this may be a small red flag.  LOL. Maybe not a huge, smack-you-in-the-face red flag but worth hashing out calmly.  She definitely owes Alice and her mom a big apology and maybe some kind of excuse about how as a child her mom was like that ALL the time and the situation triggered her memories and she feels awful for causing a scene and upsetting everyone. Goodness, I'm still aggravated on your behalf, for Alice & Rachel!\n\nETA- I was reading other comments and realized this is a fairly new relationship. I think that red flag is bigger than I originally thought.  If Lily cannot understand what she did is wrong, and willingly apologize and DO better, I would drop her like a hot potato.

However, you will be if you don\u2019t make GF apologize and make her hit the road.", "NAH. Lily is nobody. She has no right interfering. AND Doing it all in front of the child! You need to put her in her place and get a firm boundary with her. Or she has to go.", "NTA, but I think you have to think carefully whether Lily is ready to be a partner to somebody who already has a child. To me, that's a breakup-level offence on her part.", "Lily may have been frustrated but it doesn't give her the right to start a screaming match with your child's mother in front of your child and saying the things she did. Those words will have hurt your child. The fact she was surprised and not ashamed is another red flag. You have many more years of co-parenting left. Think about that and whether a relationship of 6 months is worth what that will do to you, your ex and your daughter. NTA for calling her out.", "Agree.", "OP listen to this. Do t let your gf ruin the great coparenting relationship you have with Rachel.", "I may be the only one but it's also about the ex. Keeping a good relation with your ex can change everything for your kid. No one ask them to play to the little happy family, just to give the message that \"Hey, even if Dad and Mom don't love themselves anymore we love you and we will always protect you from whatever makes you afraid, and you're born from love, and we respect each other\". They are her main love model, they need to keep at least a civil relation towards each other.", "And the ex ! It's not because they aren't together anymore they need to not be each other priority regarding Alice. They are her love model, and some kids with divorced parents can grow perfectly if they see that their parents can be friends even while being separated.

I also would tell OP that it sounds like Lily got an ego boost because she made the event and her mother didn't.

This is definitely a red flag that should be given some time to reflect on before the relationship continues.", "*I would let this relationship go*.\n\nI don't think that you and Lily are compatible emotionally.  Lily seems to enjoy a knee jerk reaction that creates drama, and you are a more cerebral, quiet thinker  - as evidenced by your use of the word \"inappropriate.\"\n\nIt may be that Lily will mature into the kind of person that you want, but there is no guarantee.\n\nNTA", "I agree with all of this, although there is one separate point I'm interested in. This makes no difference to Lily's inappropriate behaviour, BTW.\n\nWhy couldn't Rachel contact OP to let him know she was delayed at work? Stuck in traffic I could get.

It\u2019s obvious she wanted to protect your daughter from the same hurt. \nNow on to your ex. She was supposed to be there for a performance of your daughter. It clearly was very important to your daughter that she would be there. And the agreement was that your ex would pick up your daughter afterwards and take her home. It was supposed to be the switch between you two. That\u2019s also really important. And she is 2 hours late?? Not because of traffic but because of work? I\u2019m sorry but she was capable to send a text during those hours so you wouldn\u2019t be worried and know what\u2019s going on. So here your ex was kind of in the wrong. \n\nMy judgement is NAH. You should sit down with your girlfriend and have a meaningful conversation with each other. Ask why she reacted the way she did.

She lived quite a distance from us so I only got to see her in person once until she moved to our city for university. She was living with her dad which was pretty toxic. So we offered her a place to stay (because my husband is awesome). She said she didn't want charity and I told her it wasn't charity because she was family. She wound up moving in with a friend but knew the offer was always there and my son and his partner gave the same offer. My son helped her get a job at the store he worked at and they still get on just like brother and sister (they're both in their 20s now).

When they finally got fully divorced a couple years ago my dad even put some dumb made up shit about \"infidelity\" for the reason despite my mom never ever seeing anyone since him even though he had clearly been with multiple other people because for him it can never not be my mother's fault I guess.

So the comments Lily made about her are totally unfounded and that alone is reason enough to apologise.\n\n2. Even if Rachel being late was entirely her own fault and not just an unfortunate circumstance, it\u2019s not Lily\u2019s place to talk to her about that, never mind screaming and badmouthing her in front of Alice who was very clearly upset. Which again, by itself is reason enough to apologise to Rachel and frankly she should apologise to Alice as well.\n\nAnd 3. This clearly brought up an unhappy childhood memory for Lily and she projected her resentment for her own mother onto the situation which was totally unwarranted. She needs to take responsibility and get help sorting out whatever issues she\u2019s dealing with because taking it out on other people is not okay.\n\nSo yeah, she owes Rachel an apology, big time.", "NTA ur good", "NTA", "Nta that\u2019s some fucking weirdo shit, forget the apology and cut that lady loose.", "You better break up with Lily. ALWAYS choose what is right for your child above anything else. And LILY is NOT right to be in your child\u2019s life.", "NTA, you are completely in the right", "Run, Forrest, run! NTA", "I was raised by my single dad until I was about 12 then he remarried. Never once have I heard him talk shit towards or about my actually terrible mother. I agree NTA and Lily needs to meaningfully apologize then OP needs to decide if this relationship is worth it. Because continuing to co parent plus lily\u2019s contempt and anger? Nah.", "I agree 100%. This is actually the most important  part of a continuing a relationship."]}
