I love my job and I absolutely love teaching kids. I\u2019ve never made a kid cry until today. I have a student, let\u2019s call him Sam who\u2019s 12. He\u2019s the class clown who absolutely loves attention and will do anything to get his classmates to notice him. Now, I have experience with plenty of goofy kids and I adore them. I let them joke around all the time unless they disturb other students the way Sam does. Sam is super disruptive and makes other students uncomfortable to say the least.  I tried telling my boss and coworkers about this but they basically told me I\u2019m on my own. Not even a call to his parents was made.\n\nRecently, I rearranged the seating so that Sam sat far away from the other boys as he does not do the same to the girls. This worked for a couple of weeks. He spent most of the class complaining in a mumbled voice but he didn\u2019t touch anyone. But I guess he got bored of complaining because today, he spent most of class hurling insults at me in Japanese. The class is mostly second English learning Japanese kids and since I\u2019m hired as a foreign teacher, I am strictly forbidden from speaking to the kids in Japanese. \n\nAnyways, when Sam starts calling me \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201ca stupid old lady\u201d etc., I admit I got a little upset because I know for a fact he would not speak the same way to the Japanese staff and I knew telling him to stop would only make him want to do it more because I have tried multiple times in the past. So instead, in a loud voice I said \u201cWhat did you say? \u304d\u3082\u3044(disgusting)? What does that mean? Cute???? You think I\u2019m cute??? Thank you!!!!\u201d The other kids laughed a little and Sam got angry but he kept trying to insult me throughout the class. I kept doing the same thing, pretending to think his insults were compliments. In the end, he got so frustrated he burst into tears.\n\nAt the end of class, my coworkers saw that he was crying and I explained what happened. I got chastised for making a student cry.

At 12 years old (and as a Japanese child as well!) he KNOWS better. \n\nThere are naughty, disruptive students in every school and the way to combat them is to take the wind out of their sails (as you did) and then bring them along with you (make him your classroom 'helper' or give him some other 'task' that makes him feel important or useful.

But perhaps a better response (unless you are expected not to understand Japanese as well as not speak it to the students) would have been to reply to Sam as if he had spoken in English. \"Your behavior is appallingly rude not only to me but also to your classmates.  Is this the way your parents have raised you? Would they be pleased to learn that you are calling your teacher 'disgusting', etc?  Do you think your parents or your classmates parents would be pleased to learn that your rude, disruptive behavior is interrupting our class time, and interfering with their opportunity to learn English?\"", "NTA  \n\n\nThey left you on your own, you handled it. Being negative or loud is not always the way to handle a disruptive child. Kudos on you for an inventive way to discipline.", "NTA; I think you handled things well!

NTA", "NTA\n\nKarma came for Sam.", "NTA, absolutely.\n\nI started off in South Korea and Japan for a few years, came back to the states, got a master's in ESL, and now I'm a public school ESL teacher- typing this on my break, in fact.\n\nOne of the HUGE downsides to teaching in a private afterschool gig like that is that you don't have students, you have customers.  A lot of staff will bend over backwards to accommodate shitty parents and shitty kids because they don't want to lose their business.  I got very lucky at my last gig in Japan- the owner of the school had a husband who was loaded, so she didn't need the money, she genuinely wanted to educate the kids, and so she made decisions that weren't based solely on what would bring in money.\n\nWhen I was in Korea, though, hoo boy.  There was one incident I almost got fired over- I was assigned to teach about 4 pages of material across daily classes for a month.  I told my superior \"I'm going to need to make stuff up\" and got the OK, but when the schedule went home to parents, they apparently complained.  I was suddenly in the wrong for not sticking exactly to the curriculum as written.  I lost that class, but they realized they were, in fact, scheduling it completely wrong.  I felt super-vindicated, but obviously I couldn't say anything.  At a business like that, whoever complained the most recently is always correct.  You'll get dramatic shifts in policy based on whatever a parent decided to make an issue of most recently.  It's terrible for actual education, but so long as it keeps the money flowing in, they don't care.\n\nYou handled the situation here with grace and humor.  That's way more than most new teachers can manage.  If you're not allowed to remove a disruptive student from the space, you've got to defuse their disruption, and you did a truly excellent job of doing so.  10/10, no notes.\n\nEdit: I have a story about a kid crying, too.  One day at my last Japan gig, we had a new student in my afterschool class.  It was just going to be 2 students, one veteran, one new, both \\~8 year old girls.  The veteran was happy, but the new girl was so overwhelmed (I think me having a beard might have been part of it- not much facial hair in Japan!) that she spent the first class doing nothing but crying.  I didn't get any teaching done, I spent the entire time being as nonthreatening as possible and trying to calm her down...which meant I had to jump back and dodge when the poor girl threw up all over herself.  \n\nFortunately, there is a happy ending- after she learned I wasn't an oni, she started having a great time and her family was nice enough to get me a little gift when I departed.  I still have it somewhere.", "NTA at all, I think you handled it perfectly! I sometimes deal with unwanted behaviours in my classroom in a similar way. I've got a pupil at the moment who has just learnt to give the middle finger (it's an additional needs school, so more \"\" behaviour\"\" is to be expected). If I see it I just go \"was that a thumbs up? Lovely!\" and do a thumbs up. She's started showing a thumb about 30% as often as the finger now. (note that I only went with this strategy because my usual \"planned ignoring\" wasn't working lol).\n\nDid your colleagues tell you how you *should* have responded to the behaviour when they were telling you off?", "Wow you\u2019re very young for this role. Everyone I know who did it did so after college. I\u2019m surprised they hired a 20 year old. If this is real then NTA but instead of trolling him next time maybe send him to the principal or make him stand outside the classroom when he becomes disruptive. It\u2019s really unlike the Japanese schools my classmates and I had to deal with so they might just not take a 20 year old foreign teacher seriously.", "Justified AH / light NTA. I\u2019m bilingual and one thing I hate is people insulting or gossiping to other peoples face in a language they don\u2019t understand. 12 years old is old enough to know what\u2019s rude and what\u2019s not.\n\nI think your reaction to that behavior is entirely fair, frankly.", "I'd say, not the greatest way to handle that, but NTA. I'd ask yourself how you think you could handle it better next time. It sounds like this kid may have behavioral issues that are going unaddressed. Maybe you should ask other teachers for advice on how to handle something like this.  \n\nI taught English in Japan and lived with a family that coincidentally ran an English juku in the evening. I helped out at times on a casual basis (not getting paid). One kid (13 or so) was a loudmouth and disruptive a lot of the time. I can't remember what he did on one particular day, but his behavior was over the line. I told him to stay when the rest of the class left. I told him his behavior was unacceptable and not fair to the other students who wanted to learn, etc. etc.... To my surprise, he started to cry. So I asked if he understood what I asked of him and whether he'd change his behavior. He said he would and I let him go. The next day, his MOM shows up. And I thought, \"Uh-oh...\" But it turns out she brought me a cake and thanked me for taking him down a peg.  LOL. And he was much better after that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So you wouldn't do anything...?"]}
