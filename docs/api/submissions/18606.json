Ask your parents why they care so much about how your boyfriend spends his money. He's not their kid, it's not their money. When you get the laptop, I'd strongly suggest keeping it somewhere safe, and password protect the hell out of it too. Hell, tell your boyfriend to claim he's loaning it to you if it gets them off your back. Also, tell your BF to keep the receipt because if they steal or damage it or allow your siblings to do so, your BF can sue the crap out of them for damaging \"his\" property. \n\nWork hard and get out of that house ASAP, OP.

Also it's unkind for your mom to say he's \"wasting\" his money on you", "Definitely NTA for having an awesome boyfriend and shitty parents. That line about not \"wasting money\" on you is haunting. I can't think of any interpretation that isn't a deep cutting insult. There's no good reason to try and prevent you from getting what you need like that, other than control.

Tell your mom and dad that if they were to give  you a better laptop on your birthday you would use it instead. Your bf could then sell or return the laptop he got.  Then give your parents the specs for a laptop even better than the one your bf is getting you (more RAM, bigger drive, faster processor, etc.) but obviously don\u2019t tell them that.

If you are short on money and need a new computer, consider buying a mini PC.  They can be powerful and cheap.  If you need portable, there are good portable monitors (USB C) starting around $100.   If you don't know what a mini PC is, I would tell you to check out the Beelink SER5 as a good example, about $300 delivered.  But there are hundreds of them.  You can get any combo of hardware you want.   Most start around $200 or less.", "So your parents hate you or what, \"waste money on you\" is that why they\u2019re not buying anything ? I think you should confront them and honestly ask them if they hate you because they sound like they do (no offense but their behavior is weird) and if they have beef with you, ask them why. Why such a difference of treatment", "NTA. Why don't your parents like you? Did something happen that they've never forgiven you for?  Their behavior is hard to understand. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend sees you're being sort of neglected by your parents and wants you to have what you need and also feel loved.

Ive never done anything against them or rebeled. ive always kept to their rules and did what i was told.", "I'm sorry your parents are behaving that way. They are really vilifying you, and clearly don't like that you have a way outside of them to get something important to you. Honestly, odd behaviour. I was under the impression parents are meant to want to see their children happy", "God speed! I knew a few people who were in similar positions (their parents were emotionally and verbally abusive AH's) and once they were able to move out, life just got so much better for them, even if they were working crappy minimum wage jobs. Being able to relax in your own home is... a luxury when your in those situations.\n\nAlso, sorry that you have to work for Uni because your parents are AH's who don't support you. Although, if you're just doing video editing, real experience trumps a degree in it. So with your new laptop, take some time to really dig into your passion for it and work those skills!\n\nOnce your comfortable, you can start trying to work on some side gigs for extra money.", "I wish you the best in getting away from them!", "Can I ask how old your parents are? Are you sure they are your \nbiological parents?

For whatever reason they don't want you to be successful in your goals and this concerns me.

From what you wrote, feels more like your parents don't believe in your professional endeavor (at least) and think that anything enabling your career is a \"waste\". Honestly, seems to be quite a toxic relationship to have with them.\n\nWith that being said, your bf is free of using his money as he wishes, including on gifts to you, and your parents have no say in the matter.\n\nI know you are still a college student and money is tight, but you should move out.", "NTA your boyfriend supports your ambitions.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that your parents say you are not worth anything and bf is wasting money on you.\n\nMy suggestion will probably be to slowly distance yourself from them.

It\u2019s a form of emotional abuse to play favorites amongst your children", "OP, your parents are emotionally abusive and have parentified you to raise their kids for the last 16 years. They told you you were an accident, have made you the scapegoat, have convinced you that you do not deserve nice things and yell at you. They do not support your ambitions or goals. They may have let you live with them, but these people are not parents. When you are able to move out, it is best to change your number (they will call you to berate you and try to get under your skin, don't give them the chance) and go low or no contact. Do not give them your address. Make your social media private and meet your siblings in public areas or family events.Their behavior is not normal. You have been conditioned and manipulated for years.", "You need to keep your precious items hidden somewhere before they or your siblings deliberately destroy them and blame you for it. Sounds like they can't stand seeing you happy. When can you move out? Do you have an exit plan? Gather all your important documents and hide them somewhere.
