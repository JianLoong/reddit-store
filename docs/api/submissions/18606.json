I knew a few people who were in similar positions (their parents were emotionally and verbally abusive AH's) and once they were able to move out, life just got so much better for them, even if they were working crappy minimum wage jobs.

They have money and shower your siblings with luxury, but they demand you to work for your needs. They say they support you in your hobby and career path, but they refuse to provide you with the tools of trade for your career path, and even actively try to prevent other people from helping you access those tools.
