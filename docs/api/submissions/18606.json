I hope the best for you and hope you get out of there.", "\"It'll be wasted on you\". \n\nYou see, the problem isn't that they actually care about his wallet. They care about how they're being shown up. In that phrase they are literally saying they don't think you're worth it. They don't see any value in you. Seeing someone else do what they aren't willing to for you irritates them immensely because it's directly against what they believe. It shows that someone cares about you, that someone thinks you're worth something.\n\nIt's not about the money, it's not about the gift, it's about them being \"proven wrong\". I'm sorry you have such awful human beings as parents.", "Nta", "NTA. You are the scapegoat of your family. They will never change. Accept the computer gift and ignore your family. They won\u2019t be happy unless you have nothing.", "Nta", "It's because OP is going to college for a degree they don't support. I'm curious who is funding OP's college.", "Maybe an out of wedlock or adoption?", "see i thought that at the beginning as well, but like i mentioned in another comment my bfs original plan was to surprise me, and he went to both my parents to tell them the plan as he wanted to coordinate gifts. If they wanted to get me a computer i think they would have mentioned something to him", "Listen i see where you see the inconsistences, thats my fault. Im not defending my mother but im not against her even tho shes emotionally abusive. Shes been inconsistent my whole life. She supports my editing, calls me her mini me, sees me as her best friend all in one day. The next day she will throw things at me, call me a parasite in her household, and say im her biggest regret. The favoritism has always been around, the new behaviour is regarding my editing. Shes never had a problem with it until it became my chosen career. If i had chosen to keep it as just a hobby i dont think id be having this problem. If u want any more clarifications i can provide but im trying to articulate my thoughts properly since im also having mixed feelings about the new feelings i have towards my parents", "No youve got it exactly right, thats my point. They told me they are supportive, but none of their actions have shown that. So i think they want me to change my mind on my own, so they can claim theyve always supported me no matter what", "It doesn\u2019t sound healthy for you to even be around your parents.", "Parents that hold a grudge against a child have a tendency to view the child as not \u201cbeing worthy\u201d of things like gifts and such. Is their treatment a recent thing, or have they always doted on your younger siblings? If it\u2019s only recent, something may have happened that led to them displaying resentment or like the assholes here. \n\nAlso, NTA. Parents don\u2019t determine your worth, so let your partner spoil you a bit here, and remember that friends make better family sometimes", "Add something else to that plan for the interim.  A secure hiding spot for any of the presents your boyfriend gives you.  I can see those headphones or laptop going walkabout as soon as your back is turned", "Thats a good point, could definitely be the case", "It's not your fault. It's entirely on them for being poor parents.", "Throwing things at you is physical abuse. You should talk to a therapist because that all sounds like abuse. Does your mother have bipolar or boredline? That's not a safe place for you to be if she's going back and forth like that. The whole situation sounds abusive from her part, the old carrot and the stick manipulation. She's beats you down so you don't think you're worthy of anything so that when she is nice to you, you're greatful to her for being the only one that could love someone has horrible and unworthy like you.\n\nEdit to add none of that is true. You are absolutely worthy and don't let her cruelty become your reality", "i used to see a therapist for a different reason, but i did mention her a lot. My therapist thinks shes narcissistic bipolar. But she says she has anger issues that she has under control most of the time. My dad also has anger issues but in a different way. also thank you for the kind words, its truly apprechiated.", "DaVinci Resolve Pro is pretty close to Adobe Premiere.  There may be a few areas that Premiere is a bit better, but there are probably some areas where Resolve is better.  DaVinci Resolve Pro just updated to 18.5 and it has some really neat AI features.  There's a free version of DaVinci you can use to see if you like it but it doesn't have the AI features.  There are also a lot of YouTube videos comparing the 2 software programs.", "I can share some student films that were made with davinci instead of adobe. All of my friends and I are big subscription haters, especially Adobe \"you can't use our colours anymore\" software.", "This puts light on a lot of the difference in treatment between you and your siblings. The word that pops to mind in \"resentment\".\n\nThey would have been nearing or just after the end of college. Probably plans for what the next several years would look like. Maybe career path, travel, saving for a house. Getting pregnant would require at least modification, if not abandonment, of such plans.\n\nYou're the age they were. Think of what life and lifestyle changes would be needed, if that happened to you now.\n\nSome people would not care about the change in their plans. They'd either find ways to make the plans fit 3 instead of 2, or flip their timelines to match reality and roll with it. Embracing their child as unexpected but still fully wanted.\n\nFor others, it can become a source of resentment. Of blaming the child for the life plans that had to be defered or set aside. That resentment can create a lot of negative attitudes towards their child, some overt, others covert. When later (planned) kids come along, it can also mean a lot of favoritism towards those children.\n\nThat you said you've effectively raised your siblings is also not surprising. If they had/have unresolved resentment towards you, placing a large part of the burden of raising your younger siblings could have been seen as \"compensation\" for having had to start raising a family before they wanted to.\n\nAdmittedly, resentment may not be the exact reason why your parents treat you so poorly compared to your siblings, but it is an explanation that fits in the picture you've described.\n\nRegardless, as you're already aware, there's no benefit to confronting them on what the real reasons are until you're out of their house. Even then, it is reasonable to ask yourself whether it's worth the bother to confront them or to just quietly cut their presence in your life down to whatever you care to tolerate.", "I am a former teacher who very recently left a profession and I cannot wrap my head around why your parents are acting this way. The idea that they think you're throwing away a lucrative career is hilarious.", "That is probably the reason for their behavior then. They are mad about the switch and taking it out on you.", "You\u2019re 21. Their wishes mean nothing to you. Do what you want.", "They probably don't want to be the bad guys that directly force their kid to change careers and are just trying to make it real hard for her until she thinks it will just be easier to switch, either that or they are completely bonkers and need help", "Nta and I'm sorry darling it sounds like you are treated awfully by your parents. I'm getting abusive vibes and I'm glad you have your bf. Your parents are basically saying \"why would he buy that for you you aren't worth it. We don't buy it for you as your not worth it\" they are assholes! You are worthy of his love and care and they should be doing these things too. Seems like they have scapegoated you or there is something crazy going on in their minds that have convinced them you are cinderella only deserving of scraps. Get out when you can and please seek therapy to unpack. No parent should be saying this shit to their kids and suggests there is so much they are doing to you that you have normalised. Il say it again- you are worthy of love. I'm proud of you doing so well with such crappy support.", "NTA but put a password on your computer. I bet your parents will demand that you \"share\" it with your siblings even though they have their own. They're mad because your boyfriend's generosity is highlighting the unequal way they treat you and your siblings.", "You are not a waste and you deserve to have nice things. I'm sorry that your mother is so toxic, but whenever she says something terrible about how he's 'wasting money on you,\" tell her that luckily, he loves you and supports your goals, and doesn't think of you as a **waste** of anything at all. If she wants to insult you, okay, I guess. But she'll never convince you that your boyfriend should value you as little as she does. \n\nNTA.", "You don't know what your dad does?", "NTA literally cinderella's plot, I won't be surprise if they go back in time so you don't get to know him", "I just had a thought, maybe they are trying to ruin it because they were planning on surprising OP with a laptop. It could explain the recent insanity. I've seen wars started over that very thing. Bizarre. \n\nBut honestly, it just sounds like OP's family is shitty. I'm sorry OP, you deserve better. Sounds like you found a nice partner who gives a damn about you. Happy birthday!\nNTA", ">After i met my bf i changed my plan of becoming a teacher like my mom to film/editing/animation.\n\nI think I see the problem here. It's your mother, not you.\n\nShe's probably mad because she thought, \"my highly independent daughter is going to be me soon\\~\" and then you decided to be yourself, and now she wants you to fail so she can say, \"see, you should have become a teacher.\" However...if your family is \"well off\" I can imagine it came from your dad, because ain't no way your mother got \"well off\" by teaching.\"\n\nYou're NTA, because your boyfriend has every right to spend his money on you if he wishes to, and it all is done unprompted. He's doing this out of care for you, because he knows these things benefit you significantly.\n\nMeanwhile, if you rarely talk to your dad I can only assume the reason why shit never got rolling was because it was your mother doing most of the talking and enjoying stringing you along.", "NTA I would love to hear your parents' side of this story because their behaviour seems bizarre. What parent would demand that your BF doesn't \"waste his money on you\" and then generously give to your siblings? It does make sense.\n\nYour are 21 and your BF is as well. They can't tell you what he can or can't give you.", "uhhhh I think you already know this, but your parents don\u2019t like you. someone giving their partner a gift is not wasting their money. you are not a waste. you are special and worthy just by virtue of being who you are. I\u2019m very sorry your family is like this. \n\nNTA", "You know why this is happening: they don't support you pursuing this as a career choice. Their complaints about your boyfriend \"wasting money on you\" is because his gifts enable you to pursue a path they don't want you to take. \n\nI'm a Film graduate, trying to make it as a screenwriter. My parents took a long time to stomach my choice of career.\n\nNTA, OP, good luck to you!", "NTA- Just dont engage in the argument. If they want to talk at you let them til you can move out. Since it's not their money nor is he their child they can shove their opinion where the sun dont shine. You're doing amazing and I wish you lots of success in your field!!!!", "I wonder if they're thinking since the BF has money, he should be spending it on THEM instead and not you, so anything being spent on you is taking away from potential son-in-law treating them to something nice.\n\nIt has very strong Asian filial piety vibes, like a payment to the elders for your upbringing and bringing you into his life type of thinking. On the same note, why better your career prospects, just get married and pop out grandkids, you don't need a better computer for that!\n\nIt would be interesting to see how they treat your younger sister when she comes of age if that support is still there or not if and when she gets into her own relationship.", "Abusive parents don\u2019t need a sensible reason to hate a child. It can be as simple as they were eldest, or they only girl or boy. Or no reason at all.", "I can't get over the fact that you're 21 and they're behaving as though you're a 12 year old or something. You might need to get working on shining your spine OP and teaching them to respect your boundaries.", "That seems like a good plan. When you're getting more support and positive encouragement from randoms on the internet than your parents, you know you need to remove yourself from that environment.", "I would go pretty low contact with them now. Put them on an information diet, hide your presents, use the \"grey rock\" method with them, lie to them about your major, etc. I'd also make sure they didn't have any access to any savings and freeze your credit. They want their in-home help and babysitter to not be able to leave or be independent, which is why they are actively sabotaging your future career.\n\nYou said that this is new behavior for them, not wanting any money \"wasted\" on you, and it's likely because you are close to being finished with school and getting a full-time job and possibly moving out and on with your life.", "Or affair child that dad resents, and mom resents because OP is a reminder of her cheating? Could be an oops baby. Or they just suck as parents.\n\nWhoop, farther down OP said her parents told her she was an accident. I think they\u2019d resent her for \u201cruining\u201d their young adult years.", "Considering what she has said about the parents, I think she has the burden of being the scapegoat. It doesn't matter WHAT OP does or doesn't do, she's gonna be the bad guy, poor thing.  I'm soo soo sorry, as a mother myself, that your parents are treating you like this. However, Think of it this way, you have a head start over your siblings when it comes to living independently. You've already worked, have had to save money and learn to budget. These are very necessary skills. Thank your bf profusely for the laptop and just smile and nod and gray rock your parents. NTA\n\nEdit to add: KEEP YOUR LAPTOP ON YOU AT ALL TIMES. I can see the parents breaking it or giving it to one of your siblings out of spite.", "They may have let you live with them, but these people are not parents.", "The parents are annoyed that the bf is making them look bad (which they are)", "It's because OP is going to college for a degree they don't support.", "This is still bonkers to me. Even if you didn\u2019t pursue editing and animation in the end, so what? My husband (fianc\u00e9 at the time) bought me a Wacom Cintiq for Christmas one year. I\u2019m a software engineer by profession and just draw for a hobby. I understand it\u2019s a little different as I wasn\u2019t actively pursuing art as a career, but still\u2026 Your laptop is never going to go to \u201cwaste.\u201d Good lord. NTA"]}
