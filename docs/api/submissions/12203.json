Do not engage.  It will make things worse.  She will see it as an attack, spin it that way to her minions, and make life hell for everyone involved.  This is still at a stage that Ex can manage.", "Nah. Let your ex address this. Keep her at arms length.", "No matter how nicely you word a letter, she is going to see it as confirmation that she was right. Do NOT send her anything. Be polite if you see her, but that's all you need to do.\n\nYou and your ex need to have a conversation on how to handle her, and then let your ex do just that! This is a no-win situation if you try to handle it. Possibly part of that plan needs to include consequences for ex MIL if she can't behave herself around your child, including her not getting to see child.\n\nBut your ex needs to communicate this to her, not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI would speak to your ex about if first before doing it. Sounds like you have a fantastic dynamic going on for your daughter and you wouldn't want to put that in jeopardy. If he's cool with it give it a go, but don't expect it to work (but it is worth a shot).\n\nIf it doesn't work you and your ex need to be on the same page on how to handle it going forward. You can't have a grandparent bad mouthing a parent. It's not good for your child.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. You and your Ex should have this talk with her directly. Sort it out on the spot", "NTA, but I don't think it'll accomplish anything positive. It'll only add fuel to her imaginary fire. If she's talking badly about you with your daughter around, I would hope that your ex will address that, even if it means no more unsupervised time with Grandma until she shapes up. But at the end of the day, her anger over the divorce is her issue alone to get over. She's only hurting herself, and her relationship with her granddaughter, in the long run. When your daughter gets older, she'll catch on to that toxic behavior and she'll just elect to not spend time with her.", "NTA but she sure is a massive one. I will also get your ex involved for a sit down and of course how the whole situation at the end damage only her granddaughter. If she is so much against you I don\u2019t believe any message, email, smoke signal, extraterrestrial signal coming form you only will be properly received.", "NTA...but I would think carefully before sending anything. If you've never done anything to this person to inspire this hatred of you, what good is a letter really going to do? Ex-mil may well take the letter as some attempt to \"gaslight\" her thereby proving she was right about you all along. Sounds crazy...but this woman already is not behaving rationally. You are \"the enemy\" in her mind, nothing from you can be trusted.", "NTA and some words have to be spelled out to people. Couples split for many reasons and what you have going with your husband seems to be as good as it gets. You aren't going at each others throat and is being civil while bringing up a child in the best possible way under the current circumstances. You MIL seems to be left in the past where someone has to be blamed for everything that doesn't work the way she thinks. So go ahead and write out that letter and get your daughters dad to talk to his mom as well about it or she's going to miss out on a lot of things.", "NTA but she might not believe you. Can you and your ex talk with her in person? She might not believe her son either though, if she is fixated on her idea. My mum never believed my 18yo daughter that she is OK with our divorce, mum was absolutely sure her granddaughter was suffering. I guess she just watched too many soap operas lol.", "NTA, but don't do it as it will make the situation far more messy.\n\nHave a heart to heart with the ex.  Make it clear that the rule about no bad mouthing extends to his parents as well.", "YWNBTA, but be prepared for your sincere words to go ignored. It doesn't strike me that your MIL is a very reasonable person. I am not sure if writing a letter will make a difference.", "NTA, But you don't need to address her, your ex does. She's not going to believe anything you say anyway since she already thinks you're the devil.  At the very least you should have approached her together and tell her.", "NTA, but if you were stressed before the daughter's birthday, you were just waiting to see what stunt she'd pull. It seems as if her mindset is the marriage wasn't that bad if your divorce is this easy. Despite an amicable divorce, MIL has to make the situation hostile one way or the other. \n\nStop stressing yourselves out though. If the ex-MIL isn't going to show up because you're there, don't depend on her in any capacity for the foreseeable future. Accept her choice. She'll get her \"nose out of joint\", as they say, to goad you into unpleasantries being exchanged. \n\nOpenly accept that you know she won't show up if you're there. Don't invite her to the next \"thing\" because there's limited seating and they won't show anyway. It's not petty. It's pragmatic. Your ex doesn't have to tell his mom about these events. It's not that they're secrets. It's that his mom wants ***her*** approval/disapproval to be the central focus post-divorce, rather than the emotional health of her granddaughter.", "No judgment but I think this is a problem your Ex should handle. If she's already against you I don't think she's going to take anything you have to say seriously.", "NTA. Your ex should be addressing this, though. He should have a problem with his mom trying to poison his child against her mother.", "If you do anything, make sure your ex is aware and backs you 100%. Maybe consider doing it together even, otherwise you risk that relationship which is the most important one to maintain for your daughter.", "NTA. But I agree with everyone else\u2014don\u2019t engage directly. If you and your ex are on decent terms, then you should have a conversation with him so he can take the initiative to deal with it. Neither of you can make her feel a certain way, but not badmouthing each other is one of your parenting tenants, and she needs to respect that.", "NAH, but kill her with kindness, OP.", "It seems like your ex isn\u2019t doing enough to end this and he should be working on that. NTA", "NTA. It won't change anything. You will only waste your time. Ignore her. Let her dig her own grave.", "Are you sure your ex didn't badmouth you to her and now is acting like it's out of his hands???? Because that to me would be my priority 1 to find out.", "Do not write her anything. No matter what, she will take her son's side. They always side with their own. If you write that, it will only give her ammo to alienate you even more. \n\nDon't give into her games. Don't host any parties or anything else with your ex anymore. If you must see her, just give her a huge smile and keep moving. You and the ex broke up for a reason.\n\nHe is your ex husband, she is your ex MIL. Time to treat them both as such.", "YTA\n\nCoexist.  Confronting these people won't solve problems.\n\nYou are divorced.  You have no relationship with these people outside of the 6yo.  If don't like you - so what?  Just assume they don't like you and stop interacting with them.  Don't invite them to parties, don't try to win them over.  And guess what, they'll hate you for that too - but it will spare everyone drama. \n\nGet over it - someone, somewhere is always going to talk sh!t about you.  If it's still a problem 2-3 years from now, your daughter will be old enough to understand divorce and the fact that sometimes people have hard feelings about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
