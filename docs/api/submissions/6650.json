But I've noticed he's afraid to speak up to his girlfriend.\" \n\nMy roommate Daniel's girlfriend, Sara, recently moved in with us. Although I agreed to it as long as she contributed to the apartment, she hasn't done anything to help out. She doesn't offer to cook, clean, or do the laundry. On a day when Sara had no work, I asked her to do the laundry and wash the dishes before I went to pick up dinner. When I asked her why, she said I hadn't told her to do it. Daniel was present and said the issue was between Sara and me, but I let it go. I bust my ass at work, all I want are two things to be done, that's all.\n\nShe is completely lazy and doesn't do any work for the apartment. It's always me and Daniel. I approached Daniel to tell him, and he said to me, \"It's not a big deal, let it go.\" I told him that she's living here for free, she doesn't pay for any expenses, and the least she can do is do some laundry once in a while and help around the house.\n\nThis moment really ticked me off: the day I was going to work, I woke up at 6am fully energized. By 9pm, I made myself dinner for that night and left it in the fridge. Out of nowhere, I heard Sara say, \"I'm going to the grocery store, do you need anything?\" Internally, I was happy, thinking that she had finally changed as a person and realized what she was doing was wrong. I said, \"Yeah, I really need shampoo for tonight. We have none left.\" She said, \"Yeah, can I please have some money?\" I gave her $20 and went about my day, and she said she would give me the change later that night. I was happy for the entire day.\n\nBut then when I got home, I saw her watching TV all alone; Daniel had to work late. I quickly took off my clothes and headed to the shower. I realized there was no shampoo. I called for Sara and asked her, \"Where's the shampoo?\" I noticed her nails were not painted when I left, but when I came back, they were red. I checked the receipt that I found in the trash and saw that she had bought nail polish and some other stuff. I asked her why, and she simply said, \"I forgot. I'm sorry.\" You know what, I let it go.\n\nAfter showering with watered-down shampoo, I opened the fridge to see that my meal was half-eaten. Sara said she ate half my food because \"it was a lot.\" After that, I lost my shit completely. I told her, \"You're living here for free, you eat for free, you don't do anything for this apartment, you don't clean, you don't cook, you don't do laundry, you leave dirty clothes on the floor everywhere, and you don't buy groceries. What can you do? This has been happening for 2 months straight. I'm sorry, but I just can't take it anymore. I bust my ass waking up at 6am to make dinner, just to realize it's half-eaten. What's the point?\"\n\nAfterwards, Sara and I exchanged some pretty nasty words. It didn't end well and I don't know what to do anymore.", "created_utc": 1673027662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1050nco/aita_for_shouting_at_my_roommates_girlfriend/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to let Daniel and Sarah know that if things don't change, you can't see yourself living there much longer.  This is only going to get worse before it gets better if something isn't said/done NOW.  \n\nINFO:  You gave her $20 to buy shampoo.  She didn't buy shampoo.  Did you get your $20 back?  Because if you didn't, she just STOLE your $20 for herself.", "Sounds like you need to tell her to leave, if she\u2019s not on the lease it should be easy, and since Daniel is doing anything to help the situation I would let your apartment management know your roommate has been letting someone stay with you for 2 months, since most apartments have policies that you cannot have long term tennants stay without being added to a lease.", "Absolutely NTA. \nFirst she should not have come to stay there for free, that was the first issue, but is kinda between her & her boyfriend how they split the rent. \nSecond, if you & Dan are sharing chores they needed to be rescheduled, if not, Dan picks up also her chores. \nThird & not least, eating someone\u2019s food, no matter how you\u2019re related to them is always a huge AH move. \n\nI will definitely talk with Daniel to rearrange house rules, if & her refuses than is you or them out, depends in which name is the lease.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like a monster. If she's not on the lease tell your roomie she has to find her own place. That kind of behavior with roommates in UNACCEPTABLE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: spelling", "She needs to go, is she paying anything to be there? NTA if you can find another place or get rid of them..it may be ultimatum time if you can do either of those things. Either she pulls her weight or they can have each other and you leave or thry leave..if you can. Although with an ultimatum it only works if you follow through", "100% NYA Sara needs to learn how to do stuff and Daniel needs to learn to stick up for himself. You should talk to Daniel and say that because she\u2019s living for free and doing fuck all that either she starts doing stuff for she\u2019s out of the apartment or wherever you live", "NTA, please get some legal advise on whether you can kick her out or get yourself out of there asap. You should have not agreed to her moving in unless your rent was lowered and divided between the three of you. Regardless of whether she pays or daniel pays. \nAlthough, i do find it weird that you expect her to do laundry, as i personally think that roommates should do that stuff separately, you\u2019re not a couple. But whatever works. \nYou need to speak with daniel and tell him this os a big issue and he needs to do something about oro you will and it won\u2019t be the best way", "NTA never allow. If she is not on the lease she should move out.", "NTA and you know what to do - house-meeting to lay out some ground rules: No1 shd be that unless Sara bought and cooked the food, she doesnt touch it! And No2 that Sara pays 1/3 of bills.", "NTA - She moved in on condition, she broke condition, she can haul her arse out on those bronken conditions. I'd kick her out...maybe the roommate too, for putting you through such a mooch/theif.", "I would be fuming too! She\u2019s abusing her privilege. Not paying rent, not contributing in any way and stealing your food (and maybe money since it seems she may have used your $20 for nail polish) on top of it. She needs to go and Daniel needs to grow up and stop being scared of confronting his own gf.", "NTA, make her pay rent or get out", "NTA  I'd let your landlord know... if your boyfriend didn't officially put her on the lease, she's more than likely there illegally, and they can evict her.  And you're not wrong. She's a complete moocher....", "NTA but this situation needs to end. You need to have a serious discussion with both of them and not let her live there anymore. She's a leech and she needs to pay you back.", "NTA. She needs to move her mooching ass back out immediately.", "NTA, this is not okay. At the very least she needs to be paying rent and not messing with your things (eating your food, etc.). Ideally there should be an arrangement of who takes care of what that each person agrees to (preferably in writing). But I doubt even that would be enough for her to actually keep up with her part. Oh, and she owes you $20 for shampoo.", "NTA tell her to get out. She's not on the lease and if Daniel wants to live with her he can get his own place where she can mooch.", "NTA\n\nIt's not surprising when someone reacts when finally pushed to their breaking point.\n\nTime to formally evict her.", "She's a thief. Throw her out.", "NTA, she needs to be kicked out she's using you both as a free ride", "Tell them either she leaves or they both leave. \n\nIf you want to keep it the three of you then lay down a financial chart. \n\nSplit the cost of the bedrooms but 1/3 the rest. They\u2019re responsible for 2/3. They buy their own food and essentials. \n\nAt this point, only Daniel is benefiting from her being there.

Satanic Sara is.", "NTA Major \u26f3 for your friend, hope she is not simply using him. I hope she gave your \u00a320 back. You have to be straight with your friend and tell him that you don't want to her in the apartment, that this was the last straw. If she is to stay, also has to start contributing money wise, because I guess your friend is not paying 2/3 of the bills and rent, so you are actually paying for her to be here. For chores, a rota, and if she doesn't agree then she will simply have to find somewhere else to live.", "NTA. Sara needs to go. She contributes nothing, steals from you (money and food), doesn't even clean up after herself. Sara is not going to change; don't hold your breath for that. Tell your roommate she has to go. Period. If he doesn't like it, he can go with her.", "GOODBYE CHILD", "Nah Daniel needs to say something at this point! Sara a moocher who don\u2019t contribute to anything. NTA", "NTA, but she\u2019s punking you as much as she\u2019s punking Daniel. You don\u2019t know what to do??? Dude, KICK HER OUT. If she\u2019s not contributing ANYTHING, why is she there??? As far as your $20, your exact words to her need to be \u201cb****, gimme my money\u201d. Period. She\u2019s behaving the way she is because you allow it.", "NTA\n\nWhat does Sara do? She has sex with your roommate - and that my friend is where you are going to lose.\nYour roommate has and will continue to pick Sara over you because he is getting his needs met.\nIt is time for you to find a new housing situation. Sara is never going to cook, clean or contribute financially to this home.", "NTA. She's living with you for free? And eating your food? AND pocketing your money? Don't renew the lease. Let them live in a pig sty.  \n\n\nETA: She's not responsible for your laundry, though. That's a you problem.", "NTA but your idea of what she should contribute seems to only be domestic labor, which is sexist. She is not your girlfriend or your servant. And the person that agreed to her \"contributing\" is her bf, not her. \n\nRight now it sounds like she's only taking and she should move out if she won't contribute at all, but she has to agree to it. It should include rent/utilities and a reasonable share of the chores, not all the chores. And boundaries like what you can ask her to do and what is a shared thing or not. Y'all need to sit down and set clear expectations. And if they can't be met then there needs to be a plan on who is leaving.\n\nShe also owes you a $20 and dinner.", "But also, she shouldn\u2019t be doing his laundry. She should be doing her own laundry, but roommates shouldn\u2019t be expected to do each other\u2019s laundry. That\u2019s way over the top, IMO and not reasonable.", "How tf else do you expect her to contribute when she can pay rent. Doing chores in a place you live doenst equal sexist. Bet you anything if it was a boyfriend in thsi scenario you wouldn\u2019t say anything huh?", "She lives rent free, that is part of the payment for a roof over the head.", "Well, her BF is covering his half of the rent and utilities-so she owes her Bf, Not OP for that, she owes Op the difference in common space use and utilities , but Dishes, cooking and general cleaning are fine for that. \n\nWhat\u2019s not fine is expecting someone else to wash your chonies for you."]}
