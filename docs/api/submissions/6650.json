But I've noticed he's afraid to speak up to his girlfriend.\" \n\nMy roommate Daniel's girlfriend, Sara, recently moved in with us. Although I agreed to it as long as she contributed to the apartment, she hasn't done anything to help out. She doesn't offer to cook, clean, or do the laundry. On a day when Sara had no work, I asked her to do the laundry and wash the dishes before I went to pick up dinner. When I asked her why, she said I hadn't told her to do it. Daniel was present and said the issue was between Sara and me, but I let it go. I bust my ass at work, all I want are two things to be done, that's all.\n\nShe is completely lazy and doesn't do any work for the apartment. It's always me and Daniel. I approached Daniel to tell him, and he said to me, \"It's not a big deal, let it go.\" I told him that she's living here for free, she doesn't pay for any expenses, and the least she can do is do some laundry once in a while and help around the house.\n\nThis moment really ticked me off: the day I was going to work, I woke up at 6am fully energized. By 9pm, I made myself dinner for that night and left it in the fridge. Out of nowhere, I heard Sara say, \"I'm going to the grocery store, do you need anything?\" Internally, I was happy, thinking that she had finally changed as a person and realized what she was doing was wrong. I said, \"Yeah, I really need shampoo for tonight. We have none left.\" She said, \"Yeah, can I please have some money?\" I gave her $20 and went about my day, and she said she would give me the change later that night. I was happy for the entire day.\n\nBut then when I got home, I saw her watching TV all alone; Daniel had to work late. I quickly took off my clothes and headed to the shower. I realized there was no shampoo. I called for Sara and asked her, \"Where's the shampoo?\" I noticed her nails were not painted when I left, but when I came back, they were red. I checked the receipt that I found in the trash and saw that she had bought nail polish and some other stuff. I asked her why, and she simply said, \"I forgot. I'm sorry.\" You know what, I let it go.\n\nAfter showering with watered-down shampoo, I opened the fridge to see that my meal was half-eaten. Sara said she ate half my food because \"it was a lot.\" After that, I lost my shit completely. I told her, \"You're living here for free, you eat for free, you don't do anything for this apartment, you don't clean, you don't cook, you don't do laundry, you leave dirty clothes on the floor everywhere, and you don't buy groceries. What can you do? This has been happening for 2 months straight. I'm sorry, but I just can't take it anymore. I bust my ass waking up at 6am to make dinner, just to realize it's half-eaten. What's the point?\"\n\nAfterwards, Sara and I exchanged some pretty nasty words.

You have to be straight with your friend and tell him that you don't want to her in the apartment, that this was the last straw. If she is to stay, also has to start contributing money wise, because I guess your friend is not paying 2/3 of the bills and rent, so you are actually paying for her to be here.

As far as your $20, your exact words to her need to be \u201cb****, gimme my money\u201d. Period. She\u2019s behaving the way she is because you allow it.", "NTA\n\nWhat does Sara do? She has sex with your roommate - and that my friend is where you are going to lose.\nYour roommate has and will continue to pick Sara over you because he is getting his needs met.\nIt is time for you to find a new housing situation.

Let them live in a pig sty.  \n\n\nETA: She's not responsible for your laundry, though. That's a you problem.", "NTA but your idea of what she should contribute seems to only be domestic labor, which is sexist. She is not your girlfriend or your servant. And the person that agreed to her \"contributing\" is her bf, not her. \n\nRight now it sounds like she's only taking and she should move out if she won't contribute at all, but she has to agree to it. It should include rent/utilities and a reasonable share of the chores, not all the chores. And boundaries like what you can ask her to do and what is a shared thing or not. Y'all need to sit down and set clear expectations. And if they can't be met then there needs to be a plan on who is leaving.\n\nShe also owes you a $20 and dinner.", "But also, she shouldn\u2019t be doing his laundry.

(I don't know what your state laws are regarding tenancy rights.) Your roomate/friend might be mad and it might affect your friendship, but he is an AH for enabling this. He is not being a good friend or roomate either right now. You may want to consider either moving out yourself, or, getting a new roomate in general, but as far as I'm concerned they both need to go.", "YTA - Are you kidding? You are expecting way too much from a roommate. Each of you is responsible for cooking for yourselves, washing your own dishes, and washing your own laundry. Then maybe take turns cleaning shared spaces. Also, why are you all sharing shampoo? Get your own and keep it separate from theirs. As for the $20, I think you know now not to every give her money. What you are expecting from her is more of what a couple would do for each, but you are not a couple, she is your roommate. Since she is sharing a room with Daniel, then she shouldn't need to pay rent, but you should have him pay for 2/3 of the utilities. Whether she pays him back for it is between them. Also, you need to set boundaries, such as if you cooked food, she doesn't eat it. If she can't follow those rules, kick her to the curb.", "Uhhh why aren't you doing your own laundry?", "Kick her butt out is what you gotta do.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You have a scrounger on your hands.", "NTA, I've had roommates like this and experienced an extremely similar situation where it builds up to a point where I just couldn't take it and blew up. Definitely try having a roommates meeting, but honestly they wont change, and it wont end until they move out.", "NTA, you shouldn't be living with her. That's ridiculous.", "Time to have a meeting with Daniel.  His girlfriend is clearly a problem and including her in the discussion isn't going to work because she'll turn it into drama.  He needs to decide if he will stand up to her, ask her to move out, or move out with her.  You need to help him understand that those are his options. Or I guess you can move out, but that seems unfair to you.  Regardless, stand your ground.  She is taking advantage of both of you and spending your money on herself.  NTA", "NTA. However why tf did you let her move in for free? That's just asking for trouble.", "NTA. She\u2019s a lazy freeloader!! Man even most barnyard animals contribute for their upkeep! You put up with it for 2 months longer than I would have. She should be paying 1/3 of everything if she refuses to help out in other ways. Also - do you have a lease and is her name on it? If not can you have the landlord evict her?", "NTA. Honestly, if she just stayed in Daniel's room and kept to herself I'd say mind your business, maybe make Daniel cover 2/3 of the water bill. But if she's eating your food, making messes in common areas that she doesn't clean up, and not contributing to however the household chores are managed, she's way out of line. How could she go to the store with your money but forget your item? Ridiculous. \n\nDaniel needs to step up and either cover her completely and keep her out of your way, or tell her she needs to contribute or leave.", "You have an agreement and I assume name on the lease with Danial, not his girlfriend.  Boot her or both out.  YOU are not responsible for his poor taste or her bills.  And if he chooses to leave with her so be it.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Look, the question of who owes who housework can get kinda murky, but what is crystal clear is that she stole your money and she stole your food. Even not considering the housework, the theft alone is unacceptable and chewing her out for it was the right move.", "NTA Sarah needs to fork over a few hundred to you before you let her back in your apartment. And that isn't even meaning *staying* with you anymore. It is the buy in for walking in the door. Just because your roommate is afraid he won't get his dipstick wet if he makes her behave like a decent person doesn't mean you have to put up with that. If you have to put up with that thing to keep your bestie, you have to consider it as a part of your bestie and that means your bestie is 1/2 asshole.", "NTA - time for her to pay bills or leave. No other options exist", "INFO \n\nDo you and your roommate have designated chores? Or is it dependent on what needs to be done and who's available to do it? \n\nDo you each shop separately? Or does one of you shop for the household, with input from the other? \n\nAlso, would you have been OK with your roommate eating some of your food? \n\nI would definitely say you're not TA, but I don't think yelling at the girlfriend is the most effective strategy. \n\nYou'd be better off designating chores, between you and your roommate, and letting him pressure her into doing her share. Talk it out, though - get buy-in from your roommate. It's OK to say, \"there are two of you to handle your share of the chores, so let's put a few more on your side to make it fair.\"\n\nMy guess is she's young, and maybe hasn't lived away from home? Like - she hasn't learned to adult yet? My prediction is the roommate will get tired of cleaning up after her, and he'll discover that he actually does have a spine after all.", "NTA kick her out.  Him too if needs be.  It's not a healthy situation,  nor fair.", "LMAO", "YOU WERE COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED. She needs to pull her weight or pay rent and utilities. And she stole your $20\u2026so ask for it back from her or Daniel - since he takes up for her terrible behavior.", "Exactly. You guys are housemates, not married. She should give you back your money since she didn\u2019t buy shampoo. She should also provide groceries to reimburse what she ate (and a bit more) and in the future not touch your food in the fridge. You need to have your own food and they theirs. \n\nAnd it\u2019s time for her to pay rent (or he can pay on her behalf - that\u2019s up to them). They should pay 60% of rent, you pay 40% and utilities are split three ways. Ultimately the financial responsibility falls on Daniel if she doesn\u2019t pay. If that\u2019s too expensive, she can move back out. \n\nLast, chores should be split as housemates do. Which is to say that each person does their own dishes and laundry. And deeper cleaning should be rotated. Daniel is responsible for her share of the cleaning if she doesn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not your job to nag her but if they fail to get it done, you\u2019re within your rights to ask her to leave", "No because why aren\u2019t the top comments talking about this?? We\u2019re just gonna ignore the part where he\u2019s trying to make her do his laundry? \n\nAnd what about the dishes? If OP is only making meals for himself and expects her to do his dishes to \u201ccontribute\u201d then that\u2019s wrong. If we\u2019re talking about meals that everyone is eating then that\u2019s fair", "Maybe, maybe not.  OP and his friend have been roommates since college.  I can see how they would help each other out in the dorms doing laundry and maybe carried it over to after college.  If it is an agreement that OP and his roommate has, then it doesn't matter what others do.  It's what they have decided for them in their apartment.", "Does Sara need to contribute? Yes. And she'd need to contribute even if she were a he. But did OP immediately assume that those contributions should be domestic and whatever he decided she should do, as in now she should be a servant on demand to do his laundry? Sounds like it. And it is sexist when you treat women like that because world-wide women end up doing more of the domestic labor. We only have what OP has written, so we can't know if he would treat Daniel's bf the same way as his gf.\n\nDaniel has agreed that his gf will contribute, but expectations were not set between her and OP. OP is just getting mad that she's not doing what he thinks she should do. \"Internally, I was happy, thinking that she had finally changed as a person and realized what she was doing was wrong.\" Yet for all OP knows, Sara is giving Daniel money for his half of the rent, thus contributing. There is no indication that Sara cannot afford to pay.\n\nEither way, the person who moved in does need to contribute, but their contribution should be negotiated with them. They all need to sit down together and work this out.", "Not communicated enough.", "Person doesnt have job, person cannot pay rent. Her being a woman has nothing to do with her portion of household chores needing to be done, if she cant work to pay rent then she can do chores, cook meals for the people who are working or even better, she can just do her part in the household. \n\nDomestic chores or not, she isnt a child, shes an adult and needs to act like it. She also stole 20$ from OP by getting her nails done and not even buying shampoo, she explicitly asked if he needed anything then had the audacity to ask for more money for it. \n\nFuck off with the \"thats sexist\" shit. Shes a lazy mooch and should be kicked to the curb.", "No, to make it fair, boyfriend should be coving 2/3. 1/2 rent and utilities doesn\u2019t adequately cover his freeloading girlfriend.", "I had roommates like you. Don't talk to them anymore.", "\"But dishes, cooking and general cleaning are fine for that\", so let me get this straight, she gets to live there for free and don't contribute in NOTHING because her boyfriend pays rent? What kind of stupid deal is that? With that logic if i share a house with a roommate i am entitled to bring 3 friends to live in my room because i pay my half. \nIt is clear that if someone is sharing a home with other people at least they should bring some kind of contribution to the table specially if asked to, is basic good behaviour.", "If they are sharing a room, 2/3 rent is too much. It should be more than 1/2, but less than 2/3 unless she has her own room."]}
