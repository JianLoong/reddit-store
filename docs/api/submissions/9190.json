{"id": 9190, "submission_id": "10udmz9", "title": "AITA FOR REFUSING TO WEAR A SKIRT?", "selftext": "This happened in December however it still seems to be an issue in my marriage. \n\nMy (25f) husband (28m) is from South Africa (he is black and I'm white) and we live in the US. We met in 2019 and got married at the beginning of 2021. Because of world events, I have never met his family. \n\nWe flew down to South Africa a few days for his brother's traditional ceremony. This was my first time in the country.  Before arriving in the county, my SIL asked for my size and input on dresses and skirts that I was supposed to wear to meet the family. I didn't think much of everything but I gave her my size.\n\nWhen we at her house, she brought out the clothes. She said while in her home, I don't have to follow traditional dress code but I need to remember that when I go to my IL and their family home, I would need to. My husband had mentioned this before but he also told me to speak to his sister as she knows more about dressing as a married woman than he does.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the day of the events. I  arrived at my in laws. I was alone because my husband needed to be there before me and I also didn't want to go early with him. Before I even stepped into the yard, my SIL came out and saw that I was wearing a romper. She then asked me where the clothes she gave me were but I told her that I was getting too hot and I didn't want to wear so much clothing (the clothing consisted of a skirt, a white shirt, a black scarf for my head, another scarf to tie around my waist and a blanket to put around my shoulders). \n\nShe was pissed. She said she understood that it was hot but that I still needed to wear the clothes. I pointed out that she was also married but she wasn't wearing the same outfit. She said since she was in her family home, she could wear whatever but she was still following customs as her head was covered and she was wearing a skirt. She also said that because her husband is white, she is not expected to wear the same bridal outfit. \n\nI was pretty annoyed because I don't understand why they feel the need to control what I wear. I called my husband and he was shocked that I wasn't dressed as I was supposed to. My SIL offered to get me something to wear but I refused. I said that it was my body and as such, I could wear whatever I wanted. I called her a misogynist. They told me that I couldn't enter the yard because not only was I not wearing a skirt, my head wasn't covered and my romper was short.\n\nI ended up leaving and spending two days alone at the B&B we booked. My husband has barely spoken to me because he is so angry and disappointed.\n\nI spoke to my sister and my mother and they are on my side and they said that this country is very patriarchal where woman have little rights so they are proud of me for standing up for myself. However, my husband says that I embarrassed him and his family and he can't believe that I was so prideful after he shared how things were.\n\nSo I just wanted to ask, AITA for refusing to wear the clothes?", "created_utc": 1675607037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10udmz9/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_skirt/", "score": 1181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the brief time you were there, I think you could have just gone along with everything so you could actually meet your husband's family. \n\nI have to say YTA, because you travelled such a long way and this was so important to your husband, but instead of doing this one thing for him, you ditched out on all of them and spent your time there alone in your B&B. That's a bit much.", "YTA You were a guest in another country for a traditional event. Point blank. That means you follow the customs for the country. Not only that, you said your husband had talked to you about these customs. If you were not going to be ok wearing a traditional outfit from your spouses country for a wedding, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to go. \n\nThis is disrespectful to the culture you are visiting and your new family.", "YTA. Your husband told you in advance that you would need to wear a skirt. You chose to attend the wedding. If you felt that strongly about the dress code (and I don't blame you for that), you should have stayed home. \n\nPlus, if the issue really was the heat, you could have worn the skirt and headscarf but not added the extra blanket and waist scarf. You didn't need to go all the way to wearing a romper to a wedding event.", "YTA.  If you felt this way, the appropriate time to discuss it was BEFORE you were in the situation.  It really sounds like you went out of your way to create a problem when you had access to the information needed to deal with it beforehand with your husband.", "YTA\n\nAnd that's not because of some patriarchal structures in their country.\n\nIf you attend traditional or religious events you obey they dress code, simple as that.", "I think YTA. You were meeting your ILs and you married someone from a different culture. Would it have killed you to just wear the skirt for a day or two?", "As a South African I think what you did was disrespectful and rude. \n\nWe have so many different religions and cultures when I\u2019m invited to one that\u2019s different to mine I make sure I am respectful in terms of dressing and etiquette. I do this when travelling too. \n\nYou have never met his family he explained the expectations and you thought you would just ignore it. Why did you bother coming to the event? \n\nYou must apologize to him and his family for disrespecting centuries of culture and tradition.\n\nYTA if it wasn\u2019t clear \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6", "YTA\n\nYoure on his home turf, and the customs there are different. \n\nYou were disrespectful to his family --- and considering you were meeting them for the first time, I would have imagined you would want to make a good impression, not an impression of a disrespectful, uncaring wife to their son.\n\nNo one was trying to control what you wore. Your SIL was trying to help you be accepted by your husbands family, and be presented in the best light possible. And to name call her (misogynist) was super rude.\n\nYou married him and he shared how things were, so to deliberately flout those customs in his own country was really an AHole move. \n\nAccepting the customs when in his country are part of accepting that part of your husband. Whether you agree with an entire countries customs or not, this is your marriage and your life.\n\nIt wasnt a time to 'Proudly Stand up for yourself' and fly in the face of patriachy.\n\nI would have sent you home with divorce papers.", "Honestly, if you had this problem BEFORE THE WEDDING, I would have said N T A. But not only did you not communicate on this before the wedding, but before this trip! You got all the way to their house with ample explanations of the expectations and AGREED to them, multiple times. YTA for not following through, and blindsiding everyone with this.", "YTA \n\nSil gave you the run down of how it was gonna go and you disregarded her to cause a scene\n\nDon't get involved with a culture if you just want to break the rules, you knew what you were in for \n\n\nWhile I disagree with 'very patriarchal' rules, I simply wouldn't involve myself rather than cause a ruckus", "I'm a woman from South Africa and the comment about woman having very little rights is not even close to truth. Seems you're using that logic to make yourself feel better about your behaviour and fuel your narrative. It's really weird that you think like this seeing as USA is a very misogynistic country. You don't have to like it but it's traditional and you should have respected their traditions. It does get really hot here in the summer and this 1 was one for the books but you only had to wear the outfit for a little while and be done with it but you couldn't even make that compromise for your husband", "You were told in advance that you would have to follow the customs of your husband\u2019s family and you refused. You should have stayed home if you were not going to adhere. YTA.", "YTA Inclusion and Social justice are not bending the world to your norms, it is celebrating and learning from experiences other than our own.\n\nThe continuous colonization of it all. You joined a family and a culture with traditions then spit in the face of those traditions because you assumed you would be mildly uncomfortable (you didn't even try the clothes on).\n\nYour husband and his sister were clear with you about cultural and familial expectations. Your SIL purchased clothes for you, she could not have possibly made this any easier. You called your new family all sorts of -isms then put your husband in an impossible position of having to defend your rudeness.\n\nIf you were not prepared to love your husband for all of who he is and where he came from, you should not have married him.\n\nEdit to add, because this one got me hot: There are *levels* to how problematic OP is. Apartheid ended **three years** before she was born. The disrespect and violence that Black South Africans were and are shown on their own land is not that long ago.  Since she mentioned their races it needs to be said - she, as a white woman, made a specific and knowing choice to disrespect Black elders in their own home. Then tried to call in the karen brigade for backup. OP is problematic personified.", "YTA. it\u2019s no different than being a tourist in a country, where you\u2019re required to cover your head and not show any skin when entering a church or other religious building. You should have just worn the clothing as a sign of respect.", "Yes, yes, YES YTA!\n\n\\#1, A wedding is a formal event with a formal dress code. You were notified that the dress code was sex-specific. You were notified that the dress code is one in which you do not get to chose which formal dress to wear but must wear a specific formal dress. You agreed to follow the dress code by giving your sister in law your skirt size. You were notified by **the bride** that you must be in wedding dress code upon arrival to the pre-event location (your in-laws' family home). You arrived at the pre-event location not only out of dress code, but outside of any reasonable interpretation of formal wear by showing up in a one piece outfit of a blouse and bloomer-sized pants (in no reasonable interpretation is a romper as I see it on the internet formal wear). You then refused to follow the dress code.\n\nThis was, one an extremely rude bait-and-switch to pull at a wedding, probably the most formal and strictly choreographed of formal events one can attend.\n\nAnd related to that, you threatened to make yourself the center of someone else's wedding. If you did not agree with the dress code or its implementation, the correct course of action to take was **not attend the wedding**.\n\n2. Your actions were culturally imperialist in placing American cultural traditions and social norms above those of a foreign country. This is not a gendered conflict--the bride is the one who gave you the dress code. I would also remind you that South Africa in particular is a country where the white minority has a very long past history of oppressing the black majority, despite being relatively prosperous by American standards. \\[Edit: There are all kinds of hidden messages that are likely at play in (sub-)cultural traditions of people who have a history of experiencing oppression and imperialism. A visitor not following them risks creating re-enactments of those traumas.\\] Had your visit to the in-laws' family home been on a day other than the wedding this might be a closer call.\n\n3. But I'll make that call just the same. You were notified that a guest visiting the home of older adults who are the heads of an extended family is expected to abide by a dress code of a certain formality and modesty. You were informed the dress code was sex-specific. You arrived unannounced in the male equivalent of shorts and a t-shirt, not only not intending to follow the dress code but arguing with someone you had only just recently met. If you did not want to follow this dress code, the correct course of action to take was **not visit the family home**.\n\n4. Even worse, you accused another woman of being anti-woman. In this context that's like calling a black groom an Uncle Tom just because they told you to show up to church in a suit and tie. Your actions were the ones that were misogynist.", "YTA you were told all of this, you were set expectations and then you just said \u201ceh fuck it\u201d when you got there\u2026. I hope blowing up your marriage was worth it.", "YTA. Refusing to wear customary clothes to your IL's doesn't mean you're some kind of revolutionary. This reads like a 'and then everybody clapped' moment. Just wear the clothes for a couple days.\n\nIts either wearing the traditional bridal outfit for a couple days or ruining your relationship with your ILs and making your husband upset. \n\nEdit:\n\n>This happened in December however it still seems to be an issue in my marriage.\n\nyeah you screwed up.", "YTA. You cannot go into a country and disrespect people who's cultural beliefs state a certain thing. You made ALL of her family feel uncomfortable.", "YTA. You knew about the customs before you went.  If you were not going to agree to them it should have come up before the day you were supposed to wear them. These are things you could have googled and figured out or picked your own traditional clothing.  You were a visitor in a different country. It's not the same as the US you should have respected that", "YTA.  You knew that this was going to be a requirement.  No, you don't have to like it, but you essentially disrespected their culture *while in their country.*  It would be entirely different if they came to visit you and tried to make you conform.  But you went to these people's home, whom you have never met, and were entirely disrespectful.  Way to start a great relationship with your in-laws.", "YTA. It sounds like you were informed ahead of time that there was traditional clothing you'd be expected to wear. Going along with it and then refusing last second is being intentionally performative. You had lots of time to ask questions and understand the traditions, but you didn't bother. You thought the better course of action was to remain willfully ignorant and cause stress on the person you supposedly love and strangers who would at least nominally be family. Nice move.", "Hard YTA.", "YTA. You knew the expectations and agreed to them. You knew it was disrespectful and you did it anyway.", "I love how you gave her your measurements but didn't think to ask why. Did you not bother to check what the local custom was BEFORE you left for South Africa?\n\nYTA", "You should have objected earlier rather than being a dick the day of.\nDid you not think to ask questions about the rules to see if you could meet them comfortably? Discuss this with SIL so you understood it and then make an informed choice and communicate it beforehand?", "I always love the posts that say \u201coh I was told this specific detail *but didn\u2019t think much of it*\u201d   Yea, of course YTA.", "YTA you are not standing up for bodily autonomy, you are being petty and combative. Refuse to go if you don't want to wear their traditional,  cultural clothing. You were told of the expectation to wear the outfit, THAT would have been the time to make your stand, not showing up to the event inappropriately dressed and ready to fight about it. It's okay to choose not to wear the clothes, but then you are also choosing to exclude yourself. You don't get to have it both ways, as you are finding out.", "This is much deeper than you not wearing a skirt. You entered into a marriage that would have you take part in traditions that you don\u2019t want to follow. These sort of things are deal breakers in relationships, but you\u2019re already married. I\u2019ll give you a slight YTA, because you knew what the expectations were.", "YTA. You married a man from another culture and refused to recognize it while in HIS country. It was for a limited time, and you couldn't bring yourself to honor and respect him and his family. \n\nIt could have been a wonderful experience where you got to connect with his family and understand his background. But it wasn't because you wouldn't allow it to happen. \n\nBe ready to hear about this for years if you two make it. You deserve to be reminded that you ruined the relationship with his family, your ILs.", "YTA\n\nCombative for the sake of it even after knowing and agreeing.", "Tricky situation, I understand wanting the control over what you wear and being annoyed that others didn\u2019t have to follow the same customs.\n\nYTA though if you\u2019d agreed with the sister that you would wear the outfits she provided and made it seem to your husband you would too. I understand their frustration that you showed up without warning them that you weren\u2019t following what was previously discussed.", "YTA, your in laws were very much honouring you as a new bride in their family and you just scoffed at the whole thing on the basis of your idea that it was all patriarchal and demeaning instead of being included in a beautiful tradition. Did you ask what each element of the outfit meant because it absolutely has a meaningful place that would have honoured you as your husband's wife coming into the family. \n\nI'm not a black South African but I am from here so  I know that honouring the dress code at an event where you are part of the immediate family is polite and the least you can do. You basically threw a fit about wearing the appropriate outfit when it's a standard everyone else adheres to. This country has a rich culture of weddings across all the different race groups and every single one I've been to has been so special to see in person. You robbed yourself of an opportunity to learn. \n\nAlso FYI as a South African it is astounding that you packaged this all up as \"well women don't have rights here\". South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. Our reproductive rights, labour laws and specific status as women are protected FAR better than the American justice system. Our constitution protects the LGBT community, strives for a better society and doesn't cling to principles from 1845 or whatever.\n\nWe don't have to worry that our right to healthcare, birth control and protection from discriminatory behaviour is up for a gamble every election season so maybe speak up closer to home... Because we're fine as women here when it comes to our rights. So project your issues closer to home.", "YTA. You made it seem like you were gonna accommodate your husband\u2019s culture, then decided not to at the last minute. You should\u2019ve said something before the trip, during all these conversations people tried to have with you. \n\nHopefully your mother and sister will help you find a place to stay after the divorce.", "Complete asshole! YTA", "YTA- you disrespected their culture to pacify your own wants. If you felt so strongly, you should have clarified before you went. You had no mention of having issue with the clothes until it became took hot. It seems you were just too hot and lazy to wear what you initially agreed on and decided to die on your stubborn hill. Weird that you never considered any of his culture misogynistic until that day? How long have y\u2019all been together?", "YTA \n\nThis was just mean. You threw a tantrum and embarrassed your husband *because you could.* You did nothing to improve women\u2019s rights or stand up for misogyny, you stood up for being an asshole.", "YTA! There is a saying \"When in Rome...\" You are in a different country with a different culture. While you don't need to agree, you do need to be respectful. You were attending a traditional ceremony and it is an expectation that you wear traditional clothes. If you couldn't exhibit basic curtesy in a foreign land, you should have stayed home.", "YTA, she told you beforehand what the deal was. Not their fault you failed to listen. You are in a different country with different customs. They don't bend them for YOU. You ADHERE to theirs period. Sounds like the typical American value system. Our way or no way. Your mother and sister are just flat wrong here. They don't bend to the American system in their country. You literally shamed your husband which can have dire consequences for your marriage.", "YTA. This is a cross-cultural situation. You should be making some effort to respect and adapt to their culture. Clearly your husband doesn\u2019t expect you to do this in your day-to-day life. It\u2019s also a wedding, and if you do not wish to meet the expectations of your hosts you should not attend.  \n\nIt also sounds like you knew full well this was coming \u2014 your husband told you, your SIL told you she was buying you the clothes, and you saw the clothes when you first arrived. You decided not to discuss your concerns with anyone until the day of the event, basically taking your husband and his family by surprise. Of course that\u2019s going to cause more tension and conflict.\n\n*edited to remove misunderstanding about OP\u2019s background.", "Yta. You married this person knowing their traditions and decided they were above you", "YTA - tradition for tradition's sake sucks, and so does anyone who tries to force it. You should have brought this issue up in advance", "YTA.  When in Rome.....  This is your husband's culture in HIS country.  You follow the rules and customs to the best of your ability.  This is a big test and turning point in your marriage.", "YTA. You were aware that you had to wear the bridal outfit and gave no objection beforehand.", "YTA", "YTA, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ve married into a very traditional culture and whilst I agree in general terms about wearing what you like, you still need to be respectful of that culture you have married into. And respectful to your family who have given the opportunity to do so. I\u2019m also married to a South African and there is stuff I\u2019m not too comfortable with but I embrace it non the less! I would say, however, that your husband clearly hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about life there if you are apparently this blind sided by it all.", "YTA you did the equivalent of wearing jeans and a t-shirt to a black tie wedding, classy.", "Not sure why you married a person from another culture if you weren't going to respect their traditions when visiting.  But that visit and his response gives you a very clear window into what to expect in life should you start a family with him.", "YTA \n\nWoman have alot of rights in South Africa. How those rights are effected depends on your religion and tribe or culture. If you white in S.A it's like you white in America. Unfortunately the whole world is patriarchal to say its a South African thing is ignorant.  The country however does have a lot of respect for various cultures and religion particularly black tribal culture.\n\nYou chose to marry someone from a specific background. When going to that person's family home you needed to not make a statement and follow the code. You made a decision to not compromise to something that is not a horrible compromise but perhaps a bit uncomfortable. You now have to accept the consequence that your husband's family and your husband think you are disrespectful and will treat you as such. Its not like your husband asks you to follow these practices in your own home he has adapted to your country and culture. Its a shame you could not do the same for him.", "YTA. As a South African I feel disrespected for your new family. If I had anyone and I mean anyone come to a cultural celebration that I was organizing not following the culture then I would also not let them in. I know everyone has their own cultures and that\u2019s fine, BUT when you are in a different county with lots of different cultures you are expected to follow that culture to the best of your ability. My problem with you OP, is that you didn\u2019t even try to follow your new families culture you POINT BLANK ignored it. What makes it worse is that you knew all about their culture and what to wear and you STILL ignored it! And to a wedding you arrived in a romper (who wears that for a wedding anyway!) you didn\u2019t even try to compromise I DON\u2019T THINK YOU SHOULD EVEN BE COMPROMISING WITH THEIR CULTURE but it\u2019s whatever. I am so sorry for any spelling and the caps i am just so angry! As a South African I feel so disrespected and I don\u2019t even know the full story. Again YTA!!!!", "You went to visit people you knew had different values from yourself and agreed to abide by the dress code.  It's a show of respect.  YTA.", "YTA. How rude and disrespectful! You were told and people went to the trouble of providing you with what you needed, and you basically lied to them acting as if you would wear it, right up until you could make a scene at his family home.", "YTA if you cantbve respectful of your boyfriends culture you shouldn't be with him. It's not like they were asking you to change your religion or dress like that everyday.  You are sending a big message that you don't respect their culture at all. This is such a small thing for you to do but such a huge sign of caring and respect for you to do it.", "YTA\n\nTypical entitled ignoramus who thinks they are such special snowflakes they can't put their own ego aside for a few HOURS to respect others' traditions, nevermind a family you married INTO. Just the height of disrespect, but not surprising given your actual parents somehow lauded this horrible behaviour, you've obviously never been taught basic respect.", "This is tricky. I personally would never have worn clothes I did not feel comfortable in for the sake of culture. Just like I would never attend a church service I did not agree with or want to go to. BUT knowing that about myself I would not get involved, let alone marry, someone who expected these things from me or held them in importance. \n\nThere are things that just make a couple not work and are not the fault of either: differing opinions on having kids, different religions (sometimes), differing cultures (sometimes), etc. They are called deal breakers. If you chose to ignore those deal breakers then you need to be willing to compromise and/or understand and participate in their culture if they desire. I wouldn\u2019t marry a practicing catholic and then once we had a kid get upset that they expect them to be raised catholic. \n\nESH. You and your husband because you should have discussed this earlier.", "Wow, the double standards on this sub. Noone can tell you what to wear, unless they're from a country and culture that's allowed to tell you what to wear and you're on their turf", "Yes YTA.", "YTA\n\n When you go to a place, you respect that place's culture. You showed a great deal of disrespect to your husband and his family. You weren't going to die if you were that outfit for a day. Of course your mother thinks you did good, she is the one that raised you to be this entitled", "YTA easily, you are in another country so you should respect their customs and traditions.", "South Africa is a multicultural nation with many different tribes and cultural practises, but with that being said, I know for a fact that this kind of ultra-conservative dressing is not the national norm at all, I\u2019m also from an African country and 90% of the time, these kind of older women are enforcing dress codes which are old fashioned even for their own country and almost never observed by the younger generation. I guarantee you will see rompers all over if you go the town centre. Also, to the other commenters, culture can be misogynistic. NTA", "This is what they call \u201cbeing tacky\u201d, some customs, religions, and traditions require certain garb. You even knew this so don\u2019t act shocked and dismayed. YTA OP", "YTA. You do not wear a short romper to a traditional setting. Would you wear one to a funeral in the USA? Would you wear one to a corporate job interview? No? Because it is not appropriate. \n\nSame thing applies here and you were acting entitled and a bit racist, to be honest. Sure there are issues around women but that is not what was happening here and you were not standing up for women. You were being a disrespectful guest.", "Considering you wore an American romper, and refused to talk about it at any time before the wedding when people had gone out of their to discuss things with you, you are a very malicious asshole. YTA all the way. \n\nI wonder if you treat American weddings the same way? Feeling like there's some racism going on here.", "YTA.  You were warned beforehand that you would be expected to wear what as provided to you.  You agreed at first, then the day of changed your mind, you are the AH for this.  Not only that, it's normal everywhere, including the USA.  To wear a dress or a skirt to a WEDDING if you are a girl/ woman,  especially if it's a family wedding even as just a guest.    In my opinion, unless you are a literal baby ( 1yr & under) , a romper isn't appropriate for a wedding either.  Apologize to the entire family and in the future do better and be prepared for the different values and CULTURE expected of you when there.  You married into it. Now you have to deal with it.", "YTA\nYou give Americans a bad name. You don't go to other countries and ignore their traditions and laws. You are one of those Americans who go to another country and end up in jail for breaking the law and then are so confused because you are an American not a person of whatever country you are visiting so their laws and customs shouldn't apply to you. Stay home next time.", "YTA. Why not have these conversations with the family any of the multiple times you spoke with them on the topic? You publicly shamed the family and it seems you've still not apologized to any of the many people who were there offering you support.", "Americans: get upset at people speaking other languages in *their country*.\n\nAlso Americans: visit other country, refuse to respect cultures or traditions. \n\nP.s. of course its affected your marriage, your husband got to see a side of you that frankly would have probably stopped you two ever getting married. You need to re-evaluate the situation, talk to your husband, apologize, and find a way to make things right with his family.", "YTA\n\nFirst off... EW for your entitled princess attitude. You went to another country, another culture, and didn't have the decency or respect for your husband to do what was needed of you. This whole \"middle finger to the patriarchy\" is getting out of hand, and your family is equally disgusting for encouraging your complete disrespect to your husband and his culture. If you had a problem with it, you just shouldn't have gone to the country. But no, your entitled ass couldn't stand the thought of not causing a scene and then playing victim and considering it \"not fair.\" \n\nI'm all for wear whatever makes you comfortable. I wear whatever makes me comfortable, but at least use common sense. For instance, I wouldn't wear a bikini to a job interview at a corporate office even if it was 102-degree weather.

We met in 2019 and got married at the beginning of 2021. Because of world events, I have never met his family. \n\nWe flew down to South Africa a few days for his brother's traditional ceremony. This was my first time in the country.  Before arriving in the county, my SIL asked for my size and input on dresses and skirts that I was supposed to wear to meet the family. I didn't think much of everything but I gave her my size.\n\nWhen we at her house, she brought out the clothes. She said while in her home, I don't have to follow traditional dress code but I need to remember that when I go to my IL and their family home, I would need to. My husband had mentioned this before but he also told me to speak to his sister as she knows more about dressing as a married woman than he does.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the day of the events. I  arrived at my in laws. I was alone because my husband needed to be there before me and I also didn't want to go early with him. Before I even stepped into the yard, my SIL came out and saw that I was wearing a romper. She then asked me where the clothes she gave me were but I told her that I was getting too hot and I didn't want to wear so much clothing (the clothing consisted of a skirt, a white shirt, a black scarf for my head, another scarf to tie around my waist and a blanket to put around my shoulders). \n\nShe was pissed. She said she understood that it was hot but that I still needed to wear the clothes. I pointed out that she was also married but she wasn't wearing the same outfit. She said since she was in her family home, she could wear whatever but she was still following customs as her head was covered and she was wearing a skirt. She also said that because her husband is white, she is not expected to wear the same bridal outfit. \n\nI was pretty annoyed because I don't understand why they feel the need to control what I wear. I called my husband and he was shocked that I wasn't dressed as I was supposed to. My SIL offered to get me something to wear but I refused. I said that it was my body and as such, I could wear whatever I wanted. I called her a misogynist. They told me that I couldn't enter the yard because not only was I not wearing a skirt, my head wasn't covered and my romper was short.\n\nI ended up leaving and spending two days alone at the B&B we booked. My husband has barely spoken to me because he is so angry and disappointed.\n\nI spoke to my sister and my mother and they are on my side and they said that this country is very patriarchal where woman have little rights so they are proud of me for standing up for myself. However, my husband says that I embarrassed him and his family and he can't believe that I was so prideful after he shared how things were.\n\nSo I just wanted to ask, AITA for refusing to wear the clothes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then when you try to correct the second problem, you wind up at the third: will yell in their language at you when you try to correct them, and post a very poorly written complaint that features a butchering of the spelling of your name, but proves they have at least some command of your language which leads you to wonder why they didn't just read the sign.", "Brits behaving badly is a trope so I wouldn't throw stones.", "careful there. you\u2019re just behind us being from the UK. y\u2019all drink more, look at your reputation in spain.", "Luckily for us Americans British tourists seem to know to act right when they are here- I wonder why?

I could barely get those folks to respect that I don't call anyone 'miss' (sorry, it's friend or folks for me, I have no true idea of any randos gender imo so I don't do miss).
