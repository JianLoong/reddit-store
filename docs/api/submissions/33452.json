One of my rules will def be don't abandon your SO in the dark of night. How little do you care about your SO if your willing to walk away leaving them alone in a comprised situation? Yeah no one that selfish will ever be invited over.", "NTA, but if your goal is to convince your daughter that she deserves to be with someone who treats her better than B, banning B is futile.  This is a teenage romance that is due to fizzle out now that they are adults (yes, I know there are exceptions!). So help that process along by helping your daughter to meet other people she may be interested in dating.  Similarly, give B every opportunity to further disappoint your daughter.", "NTA but like others have said, banning B from the house is not the right move. A will learn that B sucks in time, but banning her from the house only gives them a reason to want to be together, they'll just do it behind your back.\n\nIf you embrace their relationship, you'll be better able to support your daughter, and the shortcomings of B will be more clear to your daughter without you being involved. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, my first girlfriend's mom disallowed us from seeing each other early on in the relationship. We ended up having a five year relationship. Trust me, you don't want to make them forbidden lovers.", "NTA", "Nta, B sounds like an asshole.", "NTA, but girlfriend sure is.", "NTA - Actually pretty well justified. But you have to go into the WHY of this stuff with your daughter. This is a teaching moment, don't let it slip you by. Things like \"Your partner should be somebody who will protect you and watch out for you, and you do the same for them.\" is a very important lesson to learn and be aware of or you could end up in a bad relationship. \n\nOne thing that does stick out to me is basically this: They're young and kinda stupid, as most young people are because stupidity goes away with experience. You can like somebody, hell you can love them, and still recognize that they treat you like shit. This seems to be what's going on with your daughter, and it's a shame. B can get lost, talk about a sunk cost.", "Banning may not work but I do think you need to sit B down and really explain why it's wrong. Ngl most of my boyfriends in high school had zero clue the trauma I went through in the world as a woman - all the weird harassment and near kidnappings as a teen  l because they really don't live that life - and if B grew up experiencing life socialized as Male then she probably has zero idea why it's wrong either. NTA but banning is unlikely to work, instead you should explain exactly why it's dangerous and unacceptable going forward so they understand the magnitude. Pull up news stories, have your daughter or wife (? If applicable) speak on creep behavior they've experienced, etc.", "NTA. You would be justified even without the abandonment issue. B doesn't show respect to your family or your home", "NTA. That man is an asshole and obviously doesn't see your daughter as anything more than a slam piece. No one who actually cares about their partner would leave them alone like that. No matter how safe they think the city is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hope your daughter finds someone who treats her well", "I think you are NTA but I'm not sure that banning from the house won't just put your daughter in more danger if she sneaks out to see B for example. \n\nDifficult.  I quite understand your concerns.", "YWNBTA, though you are one for including your bit about B's gender identity. Totally irrelevant. B is inconsiderate regardless of her identity.", "This. Be careful\u2026my mother still regrets banning the guy who treated my sister like dirt, feeling she accidentally pushed them into eloping. She wishes she\u2019d focused more on getting sis to believe she deserved better.", "Do you know what lesbians are", "Irrelevant.", "Pretty relevant considering no one in the aforementioned relationship is a man", "Totally irrelevant that your daughter\u2019s girlfriend is trans and you see her as a male. Makes me think there\u2019s a lot more going on than a righteously outraged dad. Or a family that doesn\u2019t get alone with her. You told on yourself.", "NTA, sounds like B needs a rude awakening. Honestly, I would have been way more intense and would have done something to make sure B never abandons A again.", "NTA, but agree with others that banishment creates a forbidden romance narrative \n\nI'd probably lean heavily on what is going to happen if your daughter gets pregnant. Someone who abandons her when her car breaks down is unlikely to hang around for a surprise pregnancy.\n\nI'd also teach your daughter how to change a tyre. Not saying as a jerk, just it's a good life skill to have. There'll be moments when you can just shoot the breeze, let her know you're there for her, it's casual, we're not preaching just chatting. It would honestly help if you or your wife had a story about being badly treated by an ex and that being why you broke up. Failing that, if you have a friend or sibling who has a story about being left like that by a partner. Hell, there's a storyline like that in the West Wing with Donna's boyfriend stopping for a beer on the way to pick her up from the hospital.", "YTA but for the same reasons a lot of people are saying NTA.  Up until this point you are clearly not the asshole and handled it in the best, calmest way possible.  My mom would\u2019ve flipped out if my significant other did that, and I could see myself in my youthful age getting angry at her for that.\n\nSo if you ban the Gf, my intuition tells me a young daughter may redirect the negative energy she should be feeling towards her gf at you, making you an asshole to her.  Rather than banning the Gf, I think you should keep with your calm approach and say your piece and then continue on as you have been.  \n\nAsk her how she would feel if your significant other \u201cgot a ride from some one else\u201d and left you in the dark at night.  Then keep being polite and invite the gf to activities.  The more she rebuffs you the more historical evidence you are leaving behind for your daughter to see and come to her senses.  She will see the behavior you are modeling is patient, kind, and mature\u2014behavior that your daughters gf clearly is not capable of right now.", "OP needs to teach his daughter to be more self confident and have the skills necessary to resolve some of these issues.  She should know how to change a tire and how to call for roadside assistance on her own.  I\u2019m not saying parents should support her but they aren\u2019t always able to resolve these things for her.  My dad made me change a tire before I could take the car out alone this was before cell phones and we didn\u2019t have roadside assistance.  I\u2019ve changed my own tire several times in my lifetime.", "ESPECIALLY if SO was only in the dark carpark because you *asked* them to come get you!!!", "I am a man and wouldn\u2019t leave my girlfriend sitting in a dark parking lot by herself at night. It is common sense B is a jackass.", "I\u2019m a straight, cisgender male.  I can still have more than \u201czero idea\u201d why leaving a woman alone in a dark parking lot is wrong, and I go out of my way to make sure that women I know and interact with are not left in a vulnerable situation like that.  All you have to do is open your eyes and use empathy.", "Even the male owner at my job doesn't leave me alone in the dark parking lot while I wait for my ride. He will sit in his car and wait until my ride comes before he leaves. And he is just my boss. So yeah, men should understand. Anyone who doesn't is just selfish and doesn't care.", "this. b\u2019s transness or presentation have no relevance to how she\u2019s acting, which is poorly. \n\ni also agree w above commenters though that forbidding their relationship will likely not go well, & that allowing your daughter (while supporting her in hard moments) to see b\u2019s behavior for what it is is likely the best bet.", "I actually think her identity may have something to do with it (though still an AH and bad girlfriend). \n\nSeveral (bio male) friends of mine, including my then boyfriend/now husband and my closest girlfriend who is MTF trans and came out fairly recently (we are in our 30s), had no idea why I was afraid to walk at night on my own. With time and education, they came to understand, but it didn\u2019t come to them naturally (particularly my lady friend, as she is quite tall/big).\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s still a AH move to abandon your partner in the dark and would make me end or at least rethink a relationship if it happened to me. However, hopefully with time and possibly after living as herself, B might come to understand just why her behaviour is extra bad.", "interesting take, and, i getchu. bc early on that can def be a thing, and ymmv from person to person. \n\nbut, i know a lot of trans women including my current gf, and tbh i was thinking of editing my comment with a different thought which is, it\u2019s *extra* unsafe to be a trans woman just, out in the world, and that could also be impacting b\u2019s behavior. esp depending on where they live. NOT that it excuses it - you should always treat your partner with care and take care of their safety, regardless of the genders involved. \n\ni guess it just could be a factor? like add genuine fear in with youth and inexperience and you can get some AH choices, sometimes."]}
