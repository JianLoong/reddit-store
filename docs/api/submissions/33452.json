I was quite upset about it and let them know in no uncertain terms that no decent person abandons their partner, especially a woman, in the cold and dark.  \nLast night when I heard B left again I drove there and waited with her for the tow truck.

They are both adults but it is still our house so they are only allowed sleepovers once a week. B is very difficult for anyone in the family to get along with.

We've invited her to dozens of family activities, dinner etc, and are almost always rebuffed.  \nA few weeks ago we caught them sneaking in extra sleepovers and my ex banned B for a week.  \nThis morning I banned B from the house through Christmas and am considering making it permanent.

One of my rules will def be don't abandon your SO in the dark of night. How little do you care about your SO if your willing to walk away leaving them alone in a comprised situation? Yeah no one that selfish will ever be invited over.", "NTA, but if your goal is to convince your daughter that she deserves to be with someone who treats her better than B, banning B is futile.  This is a teenage romance that is due to fizzle out now that they are adults (yes, I know there are exceptions!). So help that process along by helping your daughter to meet other people she may be interested in dating.  Similarly, give B every opportunity to further disappoint your daughter.", "NTA but like others have said, banning B from the house is not the right move. A will learn that B sucks in time, but banning her from the house only gives them a reason to want to be together, they'll just do it behind your back.\n\nIf you embrace their relationship, you'll be better able to support your daughter, and the shortcomings of B will be more clear to your daughter without you being involved. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, my first girlfriend's mom disallowed us from seeing each other early on in the relationship. We ended up having a five year relationship. Trust me, you don't want to make them forbidden lovers.", "NTA", "Nta, B sounds like an asshole.", "NTA, but girlfriend sure is.", "NTA - Actually pretty well justified. But you have to go into the WHY of this stuff with your daughter. This is a teaching moment, don't let it slip you by. Things like \"Your partner should be somebody who will protect you and watch out for you, and you do the same for them.\" is a very important lesson to learn and be aware of or you could end up in a bad relationship. \n\nOne thing that does stick out to me is basically this: They're young and kinda stupid, as most young people are because stupidity goes away with experience. You can like somebody, hell you can love them, and still recognize that they treat you like shit. This seems to be what's going on with your daughter, and it's a shame. B can get lost, talk about a sunk cost.", "Banning may not work but I do think you need to sit B down and really explain why it's wrong. Ngl most of my boyfriends in high school had zero clue the trauma I went through in the world as a woman - all the weird harassment and near kidnappings as a teen  l because they really don't live that life - and if B grew up experiencing life socialized as Male then she probably has zero idea why it's wrong either. NTA but banning is unlikely to work, instead you should explain exactly why it's dangerous and unacceptable going forward so they understand the magnitude. Pull up news stories, have your daughter or wife (? If applicable) speak on creep behavior they've experienced, etc.", "NTA. You would be justified even without the abandonment issue. B doesn't show respect to your family or your home", "NTA. That man is an asshole and obviously doesn't see your daughter as anything more than a slam piece. No one who actually cares about their partner would leave them alone like that. No matter how safe they think the city is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
