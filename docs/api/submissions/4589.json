We get along better now, but since I don't see her as often as I'd like to, the times when we do see each other is important. She usually celebrates Christmas with my family since her mom is an agnostic Jew, and it's an important time for us. My daughter was previously my son and came out as transgender to me two years ago. I honestly blame the last Christmas she spent with my family for her telling her mother so long before me. I think she has been uncomfortable with my family and missed the past few years because my family reacted badly about her coming out as being attracted to men (she doesn't want to be called gay now, as in she sees herself as a straight girl) the last Christmas she celebrated with us. It was my mistake for telling them at all, but I didn't know how to cope with it at the time. They were saying some things to her which weren't right especially since she was really just a kid, and she reacted by crying and literally running out which just escalated everything. At first I was excited to have her agree to Christmas with my family again, but now I'm realizing what happened is going to be that but much worse. I don't want to see my daughter crying again and I want to improve our relationship.\n\nMy solution seems to be causing more issues. I was thinking I could celebrate Christmas with my family without her and then do a separate Christmas celebration with her. Edit: I even told her she could bring her boyfriend, something she would not be able to do if she went to my family's Christmas. The issue is, the only other days around that time that I'm free, I'm doing Christmas with my fiancee's family, and then me and the guys (been friends since high school) have this tradition that I can't skip. My fiance is also struggling to be accepting, so I can't bring my daughter to her family's Christmas either. My daughter was upset because I had talked about how great our Christmas was going to be since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I said that we're still going to have a great Christmas and honestly a better one without my family. She says she doesn't care about not being able to celebrate with my family, she says that she wanted to celebrate with me, and I told her she still will. She started saying that she's always the lowest priority in my life and that she doesn't want to try to have a relationship with me anymore. For any other dads out there, I'm pretty sure you can understand why I'm writing here. That shit hurt. But there's nothing else I can really do, so would I be the asshole? I thought she was just being sensitive but typically when your kid is being sensitive, it's still important.

We get along better now, but since I don't see her as often as I'd like to, the times when we do see each other is important. She usually celebrates Christmas with my family since her mom is an agnostic Jew, and it's an important time for us. My daughter was previously my son and came out as transgender to me two years ago. I honestly blame the last Christmas she spent with my family for her telling her mother so long before me. I think she has been uncomfortable with my family and missed the past few years because my family reacted badly about her coming out as being attracted to men (she doesn't want to be called gay now) the last Christmas she celebrated with us. It was my mistake for telling them at all, but I didn't know how to cope with it at the time. They were saying some things to her which weren't right especially since she was really just a kid, and she reacted by crying and literally running out which just escalated everything. At first I was excited to have her agree to Christmas with my family again, but now I'm realizing what happened is going to be that but much worse. I don't want to see my daughter crying again and I want to improve our relationship.\n\nMy solution seems to be causing more issues. I was thinking I could celebrate Christmas with my family without her and then do a separate Christmas celebration with her. The issue is, the only other days around that time that I'm free, I'm doing Christmas with my fiance's family, and then me and the guys (been friends since high school) have this tradition that I can't skip. My fiance is also struggling to be accepting, so I can't bring my daughter to her family's Christmas either. My daughter was upset because I had talked about how great our Christmas was going to be since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I said that we're still going to have a great Christmas and honestly a better one without my family. She says she doesn't care about not being able to celebrate with my family, she says that she wanted to celebrate with me, and I told her she still will. She started saying that she's always the lowest priority in my life and that she doesn't want to try to have a relationship with me anymore. For any other dads out there, I'm pretty sure you can understand why I'm writing here. That shit hurt. But there's nothing else I can really do, so would I be the asshole? I thought she was just being sensitive but typically when your kid is being sensitive, it's still important. I know that from experience.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her own father is more invested in helping other people accept that she has the right to exist than in supporting her through the incredibly depressing reality that so many people don't *just already accept that.*\n\nPlease do better for her.

It's one way or the other. \n\n- tell people honestly WHY you can't bring her to events. It's not her, it's not you, it's them. Too many bigots dont see the harm they cause. How do you know whether another member of your family might be questioning? Cultures of hate should always be challenged.\n\n- do NOT let them misgender or generally trash talk her, at all. Be the first to correct an innocent slip or shut down crap. Do not expect her to do this. Practice grades of corrections. \n\n(Grades of corrections ex: \n\nstep 1. \"Oh I can't remember if he likes coffee.\" \n\"SHE does, yes.\" \n\nStep 2. \"Oh I can't remember if he likes coffee.\" \n\"You mean Name?

She is a woman. She isn't asking to be called this, it's an accurate term. \n\n- take on feedback from her but don't expect her to educate you. Look for good resources.

It doesn't sound to me like she waited to come out to you because of Judaism v Christianity; it sounds like you had already proven yourself unsafe and unsupportive, and that you would put her in unsafe places and associate with people who you would choose over her.\n\n- Once you outed her to them, you invited her to 'celebrate Christmas' but isolate her from someone she may have drawn comfort from while putting her in the situation with folks knowing and unsafe about her identity (her boyfriend, since you weren't 'comfortable' - read: affirming or even keeping your mouth shut and loving your child as you learned about what made her feel loved- or anyone else she'd have known/felt accepted by. You said when you saw her as gay, she couldn't bring her boyfriend, but that is again putting her comfort far and below anyone else's. And then they proved her 100% right in something else you glossed right over:\n> They were saying some things to her which weren't right especially since she was really just a kid, and she reacted by crying and literally running out which just escalated everything. <\n\nShe didn't make things worse- she left under what sounds like diluge of attack. *And what did you do to defend your child?* How old is she even? You say she's just a kid but treat her like she should be running into a -phobic war zone to placate your feelings, as if you're not the parent who is supposed to keep her safe? As if, if she's an adult, she wouldn't have learned by now to do that for herself *and that you won't do it for or with her*?\n\n- you still don't seem to have done any of the work to do more than change the initial way you address your daughter. (FYI: A transgender woman doesn't need to have her past specified, as transgender means (whether nonbinary, agender, or any binary transgender) different gender than assigned at birth.) You talk about her like her identity is something she can take off, something that is driving a wedge between you, or something you're entitled to have known, when none of that is true.\n\nIf you actually care about your daughter more than your feelings of affront at her not coming to Christmas (ie. If you want to ever see her on any other days than when pictures are taken), reach out and apologize. Tell her she makes a great point (*she  does*), you have a lot of work to do to rectify this (*you do*), and she doesn't owe you the labor to get you there as you're her parent and she deserves better (*she doesn't and she 100% does*). \n\nThen *actually go do the work* : \n- learn about the LGBTQIA+ community and what the terms mean, even if you start with the acronym I just used. Learn about and practice pronouns\n- now about actual people in the LGBTQIA community who use those labels and read or listen to stories of folks who have fought to feel safe or true to their own skin. \n- maybe some therapy about how you have treated your daughter and your family life. Reflect on your interactions with her and consider how you'd feel if someone you're supposed to see as a guardian and parent and loved one brought you to that Christmas, treated you the way you've treated her. Look at how you communicate and how you take offense v cause it, and how you take accountability for your actions. (Not a counselor, just a start)\n- address the fact that your fiance and the family that you brought her to last Christmas verbally went after your kid and you didn't have any response worth describing here to you. Are you okay with that? If so, see step 3. Otherwise, they need to apologize or you need to realize that that person is likely no longer considered safe around / to your kid, and you have to take accountability for taking her there.\n- while you're doing that last one, depending on where you are, there may be local groups or virtual ones but for parents and families of LGBTQIA folks. If you're processing, it's safer for you to process with someone with someone who doesn't know your kid and is at least proven a tiny bit safer.\n\nOnce you've done this a few months, make the effort and reach out for coffee. Not a family holiday, not an event, something quiet, personal, and just you two to start. Don't push back if she wants to bring her boyfriend - he may be there for support. Then apologize. Tell her you've been working on yourself and how you're not done (can near promise you won't be), but her not feeling valued was a direct result of you not showing her she was. Don't just say she didn't feel valued, *you didn't value her above your own feelings or that of those at your Christmas*. Then offer to take it slow. The holidays are the symptom - you're treating the diseased relationship and it sounds like the issue runs deep.\n\nNone of this is a solution, and no, no one gets a manual, but you expected your child to automatically do the very vulnerable work of opening up to you about a sexuality then a gender identity, both of which opened her underbelly ... after you've proven to incidentally carry sharp sticks and happened arm your family and fianc\u00e9. Which is why I'll also say this.\n\nIf after all this, she still wants a break from you, still wants distance from you, or even still wants no contact with you? Let. Her. Go. You have done the damage here, from what you describe, and left your kid in a position to need to protect herself. Grace and forgiveness are virtues, especially this time of year for many, but so is a woman who knows what unsafe means and what to do with it. That doesn't mean the internal work for you is any less important; it means you're not entitled to someone you've treated poorly.

Look, this is the point in your relationship where you will make or break it, often _permanently_.\n\nYou've done all the easy things -- calling her by the right pronouns, calling her by the right name, telling people off.  But those are the _easy_ parts.\n\nAre you willing now to cut out the cancers in your life for her sake?   Are you willing to make _actual_ sacrifices if it means she's happier?\n\nPeople like your family and your fiance's family are why trans kids have such a high suicide rate.  Are you really okay with being around these people knowing that?", ">They were saying some things to her which weren't right \n\nSo they abused your daughter and you\u2019re still seeing them?\n\n>I'm doing Christmas with my fiancee's family, \n\nYou can skip that.\n\n>and then me and the guys (been friends since high school) have this tradition that I can't skip. \n\nYes you can.\n\n> My fiance is also struggling to be accepting, so I can't bring my daughter to her family's Christmas either\n\nSo you\u2019re marrying a transphobe when you have a trans daughter?\n\nMan, you are *such* an asshole. Excuse after excuse after excuse for why you need to kiss the arse of bigots and bullies. Contemptible. I hope she completely cuts contact with you. YTA", "YTA. Sorry the thing you do with your friends is more important than your daughter who is racing out to you.   I'm pretty sure that if you're friends are actually your friends they will understand you needing to prioritise your child!", "You have several choices. You could skip your family Christmas where you have previously outed your daughter inaccurately and without her consent, and where she does not feel safe. You could skip Christmas with your fianc\u00e9e. And you could skip the event with the guys. You are prioritising three other engagements, all of which are optional, over spending time with your daughter. \n\nIf you keep on with this self-serving combination of \u2018not seeing her as much as you\u2019d like to\u2019 and every excuse under the sun not to be able to fit her into your schedule, you will lose her. Frankly you should be counting yourself lucky she\u2019s still willing to spend time with you after you outed her.\n\nYou also get the side eye for claiming that your daughter being upset and leaving the room after you dropped her in it with homophobic relatives \u2018escalated\u2019 anything. That was all you. \n\nYTA. You\u2019re making it very clear where your priorities lie. Don\u2019t act shocked three or five years from now when your daughter wants nothing to do with you, and certainly don\u2019t go round asking why this has \u2018happened to\u2019 you.

Why are spending time with \"the guys\" doing a \"tradition\" you \"can't skip\"? Will you just drop dead on the spot if you don't do this tradition? If not, then you absolutely can skip it this year. If \"the guys\" can't understand why you need to be their for your child, then they aren't real friends in the first place.\n\nYTA And you just lost your daughter. So good news! You don't have to pick between your bigoted families and your daughter anymore!/s\n\nWhat an absolutely awful father you've shown yourself to be.", "YTA...listen if I had a child, who wasn't accepted by the rest of my family, I would ditch the whole family, no lie, no low contact, simply no contact and I would spend the holiday with them.

Know what I did when it became clear that my family wouldn\u2019t accept the fact that my daughter is gay and said awful shit to her? Left and didn\u2019t go back.

I have friends who are trying their best to remember \"they/them\" and correcting each other around me. When someone acts a fool, my husband steps up. I have support around me.

Actually support her. What you are suggesting in this post is segregating her from other people \"oh but it'll be just as good!!\"... yeah hun... no... anyone with eyes and especially your daughter can tell the reality of the situation is that you dont want to take the action necessary to show your daughter that you accept her and are willing to stand up for her.", "Just understand, this is just the first step\n\nThis won\u2019t magically fix things with your daughter\n\nTalk to her, really listen to what she has to say and work from there or kiss her goodbye cause she will be gone", "No one thinks it\u2019s funny, we think it\u2019s repulsive.

You\u2019ll be surprised", "It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s clearly how your daughter is seeing things. You are putting everyone above her. And her perception is her reality. From your post that\u2019s how it sounds to us, even if your intent isn\u2019t that, it\u2019s what is how everything is coming off as.

This is exactly how your daughter sees the situation without you sugar coating it.", "OP, I snorted when you said that a person made a joke about your situation. It wasn\u2019t a joke, it was the truth.

That isn\u2019t trying IMO", "No. His family and future wife are all transphobic and he's choosing to spend time with them instead of his daughter. \n\n\"Not a deadbeat\" is a low bar. \n\nHis daughter deserves better.", "Yah, this what got me. He isn't trying. He should have cut contact with his family when they bullied his daughter. He shouldn't even be dating fiancee for being a bigot. No, OP isn't \"trying\". He wants his daughter to accept the insults and keep her hidden. Every word your daughter said was true. She was your last priority. I hope she finds a new loving family. YTA big time.", "He is not trying lol. He is trying to cover his tracks by coming up with excuses. There's a huge difference. I see it all the time when I see patients, it's like Occam's Razor, the simplest reason is the answer.

He throws in the bring the boyfriend along as the extra insult cherry on top.\n\nYTA.", "Reading the OPs comments is so infuriating. My husband was thoroughly ignorant about what it meant to be trans, as well as non binary, when we first got together. Which nowadays is amusing because 2 of his kids from his prior marriage are enbys, and 3 of his/our stepkids are a variety of LGBTQ+. \n\nWhen I say ignorant, I mean actually ignorant. He did not at all grasp the concept of being non binary, or really even understand what it meant to be trans. Funny enough, he asked questions and listened to me and our array of kids until he could get enough of an understanding of both and what he needed to do to respect people. \n\nIt's not that fucking hard. Honestly I'm not convinced he really understands, but he took the time to talk to me, the kids, their partners, etc and while he may not ever really *get* it, he loves and respects them, and now has the tools and perspective to act out the love and respect he feels. \n\nHe was never against being trans or nonbinary, though, which seems to be the major issue here, not only for the fiance, but for OP and their family..."]}
