We get along better now, but since I don't see her as often as I'd like to, the times when we do see each other is important. She usually celebrates Christmas with my family since her mom is an agnostic Jew, and it's an important time for us. My daughter was previously my son and came out as transgender to me two years ago. I honestly blame the last Christmas she spent with my family for her telling her mother so long before me. I think she has been uncomfortable with my family and missed the past few years because my family reacted badly about her coming out as being attracted to men (she doesn't want to be called gay now, as in she sees herself as a straight girl) the last Christmas she celebrated with us. It was my mistake for telling them at all, but I didn't know how to cope with it at the time. They were saying some things to her which weren't right especially since she was really just a kid, and she reacted by crying and literally running out which just escalated everything. At first I was excited to have her agree to Christmas with my family again, but now I'm realizing what happened is going to be that but much worse. I don't want to see my daughter crying again and I want to improve our relationship.\n\nMy solution seems to be causing more issues. I was thinking I could celebrate Christmas with my family without her and then do a separate Christmas celebration with her. Edit: I even told her she could bring her boyfriend, something she would not be able to do if she went to my family's Christmas. The issue is, the only other days around that time that I'm free, I'm doing Christmas with my fiancee's family, and then me and the guys (been friends since high school) have this tradition that I can't skip. My fiance is also struggling to be accepting, so I can't bring my daughter to her family's Christmas either. My daughter was upset because I had talked about how great our Christmas was going to be since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I said that we're still going to have a great Christmas and honestly a better one without my family. She says she doesn't care about not being able to celebrate with my family, she says that she wanted to celebrate with me, and I told her she still will. She started saying that she's always the lowest priority in my life and that she doesn't want to try to have a relationship with me anymore. For any other dads out there, I'm pretty sure you can understand why I'm writing here. That shit hurt. But there's nothing else I can really do, so would I be the asshole? I thought she was just being sensitive but typically when your kid is being sensitive, it's still important.

We get along better now, but since I don't see her as often as I'd like to, the times when we do see each other is important. She usually celebrates Christmas with my family since her mom is an agnostic Jew, and it's an important time for us. My daughter was previously my son and came out as transgender to me two years ago. I honestly blame the last Christmas she spent with my family for her telling her mother so long before me. I think she has been uncomfortable with my family and missed the past few years because my family reacted badly about her coming out as being attracted to men (she doesn't want to be called gay now) the last Christmas she celebrated with us. It was my mistake for telling them at all, but I didn't know how to cope with it at the time. They were saying some things to her which weren't right especially since she was really just a kid, and she reacted by crying and literally running out which just escalated everything. At first I was excited to have her agree to Christmas with my family again, but now I'm realizing what happened is going to be that but much worse. I don't want to see my daughter crying again and I want to improve our relationship.\n\nMy solution seems to be causing more issues. I was thinking I could celebrate Christmas with my family without her and then do a separate Christmas celebration with her. The issue is, the only other days around that time that I'm free, I'm doing Christmas with my fiance's family, and then me and the guys (been friends since high school) have this tradition that I can't skip. My fiance is also struggling to be accepting, so I can't bring my daughter to her family's Christmas either. My daughter was upset because I had talked about how great our Christmas was going to be since we hadn't seen each other in a while. I said that we're still going to have a great Christmas and honestly a better one without my family. She says she doesn't care about not being able to celebrate with my family, she says that she wanted to celebrate with me, and I told her she still will. She started saying that she's always the lowest priority in my life and that she doesn't want to try to have a relationship with me anymore. For any other dads out there, I'm pretty sure you can understand why I'm writing here. That shit hurt. But there's nothing else I can really do, so would I be the asshole? I thought she was just being sensitive but typically when your kid is being sensitive, it's still important. I know that from experience.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
