That\u2019s a significantly greater impact to the trajectory of her life.", "Ah, that one's buried quite deep down. It is some missed context, then.", "I like this thread! \nDefinitely have her work on her appeal, but you and husband help. Yep. This is good. \n\nIt does seem she is pulling attention seeking behaviours - make sure you\u2019re there for her too.", "Maybe she is also not challenged enough? Some children act out and burn their creative/ mind energy by doing stupid things...", "Thank you. This is an important, but overlooked point. This girl may be smart, but she\u2019s immature. The kids in the advanced programs honestly don\u2019t deserve to deal with this behavior in class. You shouldn\u2019t get to negatively affect other kids education any further.", "Exactly! I am too and I never got in trouble at school, I think I got detention once in like 11th grade maybe. The idea that kids with neurodivergencies are all bad is a problem.", "If a child with special needs is disruptive because they're not getting taught at the appropriate level, that's on the school, not the student. How is this any different?\n\nAs someone who's worked with many gifted students, what you're talking about is multiple years of academic suffering and classes that feel like torture over bad behavior that doesn't actually sound very disruptive", "OP's not excusing anything, just stating what her daughter did and her excuses for why she did it.", "She already got punished for those behaviors, I am not excusing them, if I was then I would be writing that appeal", "No worries, I think it can be edited if you want :)", "Taking this class will not have any impact on her future. None! I\u2019m saying this as someone who went through a gifted program in high school. Nobody cares.\n\nIt WILL impact her future though if she doesn\u2019t learn consequences for her actions. Fighting for your child can take on many different looks. Mom is fighting for her child by making sure she does understand that her actions have consequences. Would it be better for her to break other people\u2019s property and steal when she\u2019s an adult and could go to jail? Would it be better to be disruptive and unprepared in college where she could get kicked out of her program or in the workforce where she\u2019ll get fired? Fighting for her in this case means fighting for her to learn right from wrong and fighting to make sure she understands consequences of her actions when the stakes are still low.", "I\u2019ve never taught but I agree. And talking to the principal once or twice a year doesn\u2019t seem bad either. Maybe OP is just not used to this from their other kids", "She got detention at school for a week and her phone was taken away for 2 weeks at home. Only computers when she needed to her homework, stuff is turned in online.\n\nNo apology, the I won't do it again.", "Ok but that wasnt the mother it was the school. If there's no oficial diagnosis that she have ADHD, then it makes sense for the school to deny her the placement, because she could be a detriment to the other students learning.", "Ah, I see where you're coming from. But I also think you'll understand why I believe that's hyperbole.", "Me too. Like I said, I\u2019m literally on the team that DIAGNOSES and TREATS the treatable needs. \n\nIt would be pretty damn foolish for you to continue to argue that ALL bad behaviors are treatable disorders.", "You're right. She can get her child evaluated AND not appeal this for her. ADHD or not, you can't expect to pick locks, get in trouble, have the principal call your mom a lot of the time and still get to do anything. Actions have consequences", "ADHD makes it difficult to control impulses, but not impossible. I have ADD so I kind of understand. The child should be tested, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nThe Father didn't bar her from anything. The child did this to herself. She was denied because of her behavior. If she wants to attend these courses, she has to improve her behavior. In the meantime, there is nothing that those courses can teach you that you can't learn on your own. She can study up and improve her behavior.", "If we are going this route then everyone should be allowed in this advanced course regardless of circumstances. I don't really disagree with that, but in this instance there are standards. The child did not meet them by no fault but her own. Education is very good, but so is responsible behavior.", "You suggested autism put of a tiny amount of info. A bunch of people stepped up to tell you why that's not okay, your responses are just getting upset at autistics for calling you out and doubling down that you didn't technically diagnosis her. We know that, you're not her dr so you can't. You could easily say \"oh im sorry, I didn't realize me saying this is harmful to people with autism and painting it in a bad light, thank you for informing me, I will do better. Also, in a few comments op said they've had all their children screened and chilf in question seems to just be displaying bad behavior and is aware of what she's doing, just doesn't seem to care. Arsehole and ashole are pretty equal on insult level. Who's swearing at teenagers?", "I don\u2019t usually look at time stamps. Yours is the highest post about the subject and others reading it won\u2019t necessarily look that far either so my comment wasn\u2019t only for you but for others reading along.\n\nI have commented on other posts.\n\nWhat are your experiences that you\u2019re referencing? Context can help.", "Picking locks and stealing isn\u2019t just being naughty \n\nThe issue is that people on this sub jump to autism every time someone does something shitty. That contributes to negative stereotypes", "Except she had the money to buy the supplies but stole them\n\nI\u2019m standing firm by not diagnosing people that y\u2019all don\u2019t have the qualifications to diagnose nor know", "Its not even an AP course just a sneak peak of the classes, She will do chemestry for like a month, then do biology, then engineering, and finally med. It shows off the different tracks of the school, and with it you can be placed in the higher biology without taking a test.\n\nMy middle child didn't do it and still was able to get into the higher class by taking the test. It was a bit of studying but that was it.", "Lol my ap teachers were so passionate about their jobs it made me love school and when you love something you want to work harder for it.", "Yeah, OP said her daughter is \u201ca class clown.\u201d So even if she\u2019s not always doing serious things that require a talk with the principal, that kind of behavior is still incredibly disruptive to the learning environment. It\u2019s not fair to the other kids in the program to have to put up with that.", "I really hate that this subreddit that if a kid is acting out people claim ADHD. People forget sometimes kids can just be jerks or want to test boundaries.", "Ok, I didn't see that that was part of the question,  thanks for correcting.  This just made me wonder how op was working at correcting the behavior.", "Sorry I misread the comments.  You are doing the right thing in teaching her that she is not immune to consequences.", "Is she seeing a counselor?", "Yeah responsibile behaviour is important but education should never be used as a punishment/reward", "'getting upset at autistics'? I *am* autistic & I've an autistic child so give over. I asked a question to help inform my decision, an answer to which was given elsewhere in the comments section *after* I asked it. I'm not sure why this is so difficult to understand. You understand the word 'after'? Had she replied to me I could have responded 'fair enough, you sound like a great mum & just need to find the discipline that your daughter responds to, good luck, NTA' \n\nBut no one in their right mind would step into this dumpster fire of a thread now. \n\nAnyhooo, I'm bored of this weird attack & associated patronising. Have a nice day", "Look, I don't know you & your experiences & neither do you know mine.\n\nPicking locks isn't just naughty but it's not 'arsehole' either.", "Just saying but a lot of symptoms of ADHD and autism, counteract one another leading to cases like myself who didn't know I was autistic and had ADHD until I was an adult, because the behaviors would make it seem like a once off or occasional issue instead of presenting a continuous predictable sign of either, as a result, I spent my entire childhood feeling isolated, because even to my closest friends I was just putting on a mask to seem normal and even then there were many many times when it felt like the rest of the world had some secret language I wasn't a part of and that I was just alone, it wasn't until someone literally arm chair diagnosed me as an adult, did I start looking into it and realizing I wasn't alone, usually the people doing this for autism and ADHD specifically, are autistic or have ADHD themselves and have studied it to such an extent that many times we know more about them than the psychiatrists we have sought out for help with it, we aren't saying something is wrong with people we armchair diagnose or that something needs to be fixed but that the person has a fundamentally different way of understanding the world around them and as such need help to do so in a healthy way, just so you know, another sign of autism and ADHD is hyper fixations, where in we will obsess and learn literally everything we can about something that we can, I have not met anyone who has autism and ADHD that has not had a hyper fixation on what autism and ADHD are because they wish to better understand themselves and how they are different and a result of that is being able to easily notice the symptoms in others even if they are symptoms we ourselves don't experience, their may be issues with armchair diagnoses of other things but for ADHD and autism there's literally no harm in checking and only good can come if it turns out to be true because fun fact those of us with autism are 4x as likely to commit suicide due to the isolation we feel, being diagnosed early and being able to understand and seek out others like yourself is such an amazing thing that can prevent it from happening", "Stealing things is asshole", "This was a situation at school & with an apparent purpose, not a random theft in a shop. Would I do it? No. Would I be pissed if my kids did? Yes. Would I want to understand their thinking behind it to make an informed decision? Yes.", "It had no purpose. OP gave her the money to buy what she wanted but she stole them instead"]}
