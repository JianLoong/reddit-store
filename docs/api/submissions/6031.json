Its a pretty good program but it is only for the top students in middle school, basically the best of the best.

Just this year she picked the lock to a art classroom to get some coloring tools. I am talking to the principal at least once or twice a year. Not the mention how many times she has come home with a pink slip (its like a warning). She's the class clown and really bright.

Y\u2019all need to grow up", "I wonder if sometimes it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I've heard a few kids outright say things like \"I can't get in trouble because I have ADHD!\". Sometimes schools will be overly lenient on any kid who has a diagnosis, and there will always be kids who abuse leniency no matter the reason behind it.", "You yourself admit that she did not feel safe enough with the therapist to do work. How can you trust them to diagnose (ESPECIALLY given the medical misogyny and misunderstanding of women and girls with ADHD) when they couldn't even do their jobs successfully to get her talking?\n\nPlease. Please see that your daughter is being villainized here when all she needs is supports. Her biggest crimes are about forgetting things and lacking timeliness. Those aren't malicious acts! She is a joyful, loving girl who tries to bring laughter to folks around her. Don't punish her for clearly having an unrecognized disability by assuming malicious intent.\n\nIf you can acknowledge that your daughter has a good heart please give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nPlease. Get her help. What's the harm in looking into good supports for ADHD children? You'll give her something helpful even if she isn't ADHD? That's the point of parenting, isn't it?\n\nPlease. Please stop being your child's bully.\n\nAnd watch this: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMFc3ytY2/", "I'm willing to bet that safety is the school's concern here. It's pretty unusual for schools to take behavior into account when considering kids for advanced classes. But for classes where students will be working with dangerous equipment? Then it can become a factor.\n\nPlus, the classes take place on another campus. If she decides to skip class and run around the high school, or decides to run off while they're being transported between buildings, that's going to be a big problem. It could also potentially put the whole program at risk: the high school may not agree to host these classes any more if the students are causing problems.\n\nIf safety is the concern, then I doubt an appeal is going to be successful anyway. Though I do like the idea of having her fill out the appeal herself.", "The best parenting advice Reddit has on offer: don't try. Make her do it by herself like a child should know how to!\n\nJesus.", "Because trying to fix an issue by continuing to use the same method that has already failed multiple times would make more sense\u2026?", "Yeh - and it\u2019s a lot easier to take the \u201cnaughty\u201d \u201cclass clown\u201d badge than it is to say \u201cI have no idea how to do all these very basic things you\u2019re asking of me and I don\u2019t know why and I\u2019m simultaneously bored out of my god damn mind\u201d", "Part of school to trying to teach good behavior.  Since this is something the daughter wants it seems like a good opportunity to teach that lesson.  I feel a probationary period would teach her this lesson.  The rejection offers no opportunity for growth and no reason not to continue behaving poorly.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m fully in NAH.  If the daughter wants it, she can petition herself which would be another good lesson.", "And to cover the embarrassment of knowing you\u2019re gifted but still, somehow, manage to fuck up everything no matter how hard you try. \n\nAnd to make the person laugh who\u2019s so disappointed in you that it breaks your heart but you don\u2019t even understand why they\u2019re mad. \n\nAnd to gloss over how you\u2019re not performing as good as peers when you know you\u2019re just as capable. \n\nAnd to hide the frustration and self loathing you have for being a \u201closer.\u201d \n\nAnd then, eventually, bc you\u2019ve stopped caring bc no one tries as hard as you do, DAMN IT, but you\u2019re just a failure so you must be defective.", "My cousin has ADHD and always got into trouble at school and in his free time. Sometimes for pretty awful things, like tormenting cats. \n\nWe'll, eventually he got caught dealing drugs and had to go to jail for a few months. He didn't like that, oh no. Still wouldn't take his meds, but the BS stopped abruptly.

It\u2019s a small point and probably too nuanced to make over text.\n\nETA - My issue is that schools tend to act in their own best interest.  Of course they don\u2019t want to deal with OP\u2019s daughter, it will be easier for them if she\u2019s not there.  They don\u2019t care about this being a lesson.  All they had to do was send a letter and wash their hands of it.\n\nThat puts it on OP.  I 100% agree that OP shouldn\u2019t fight for this either.  My whole point is that if the daughter wants this bad enough, she should be given the opportunity appeal herself.  This will force the school to have the conversation with the student which is where the lesson, whichever way it goes, can happen.\n\nSorry for spamming on this.  I\u2019m not good at expressing this in text so I tend to just add more words."]}
