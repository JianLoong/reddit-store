You cannot tell me that this was unintended on the bride/groom part and they're at the \"find out\" stage of fucking around on the invitations.\n\nBuddy probably thought his place was a bit firmer in the group than it is since his fiance entered the picture and thought it would be fine. That's his *own* miscalculation. \n\nYou're going to lose friends as you get older to people that you don't like. You can choose to fight with them about it or just let their path take them.

You could easily leave the wedding by 8 PM, 9 at the latest, and go to a bar. You can also sneak alcohol in purses and pour it in your glasses when no one is looking. Your friend sucks for doing the wedding on a holiday and hiding that it\u2019s dry, but that in itself isn\u2019t a reason to bail last minute when there are simple workarounds.", "Wow. WTF? Alcohol is more important than your friendship? Yeah, YTA. Absolutely pathetic.", "NTA because weddings are assumed to be alcoholic unless specified otherwise.  You weren't given all the information so therefore your \"yes\" was compromised before you even gave it.  People can have their weddings the way they want, but they don't get to dictate/demand others attend, especially if all the info isn't given.\n\nPeople want vegan weddings?  Great!  Don't be upset when meat eaters don't attend, or leave early.  Don't want children at weddings?  Great!  Don't be upset people with parents of small children can't/won't attend.

It's more important to you to get plastered? There is one day your friend is getting married, and dozens of New Years Eves coming your way in future years.\n\nI'm completely mystified by people who get \"pissed off\" when they find out alcohol won't be served at a wedding. I always thought the point was to be with your friends/family on an important day in their lives and celebrate with them. I stand corrected. I now know it nothing more than an excuse to get wasted and anything important the bride and groom are doing is irrelevant. We must drink!", "ESH they should know that no one likes nasty surprises, and finding out that a wedding on NYE is dry is not a nice surprise.  Also hosting a wedding on NYE in general feels pretty off, a bit like having a wedding on Christmas Eve.  However if this guy is a good friend of yours you should support him regardless, as this will likely be a once in a lifetime event for him, and you should want to share in that more than getting drunk.", "YTA. If you can\u2019t bear to go that one time without drinking then you sound like you have an alcoholism problem. Although frankly I think the main problem is you just don\u2019t like her, and this is a convenient excuse to not attend. Maybe this guy is better off without you and the others who cancelled, the other four are clearly better friends to him than the rest of you.", "YTA. You\u2019re not there for your friend at an important time in his life. You\u2019ve put drinking above your friendship. \nYou could easily go to the wedding, stay for dinner and then leave the reception for a bar. Not tough to do both.", "I mean, the friend is  kind of a AH for NYE wedding that's the 1st problem. But also your the AH for skipping it because of the no booze at such a late notice. Wedding are mad expensive these days. You could also pocket a flask and bounce once the dancing begins, ya know. ESH. Not stating on the invite its NA for an obvious drinking holiday wedding is a trash move, they knew what they were doing, trying to pull a fast one. ESH", "YTA here sorry bud. Yes he should have warned you and yeah it\u2019s shit, but you\u2019ve essentially told him one night of booze is more important than him. And he\u2019s right about it the expense. I think this will be friendship ending, as he clearly means so little to you all (who backed out). If it were me I would have sucked it up, attended until midnight and then went out to a bar afterwards, or gone boxing on Jan 1st whilst is always really awesome (so many day party events)", "Jesus Christ.

Prima Donna that shit. Much better for everyone.", "YTA. Nice friend you are that you want to back out because no alcohol. You, your wife and friends sound like alcoholics. If you can only party with alcohol, you have a problem. Since being drunk is more important to you then your friends wedding.\n\nShould they have mentioned that there wouldnt be alcohol. DOES IT EVEN MATTER?! You go to support your friend on his wedding day. That is what matters and getting drunk isnt. \n\nYou are not a friend. If i was the groom, i would cut all ties with you and these so called friends.", "You may want to examine why a dry wedding is such an affront to you and your wife. \n\nNTA, but weddings are a blending of two people, not a boozy shindig. Don't understand why y'all are mad. Their wedding is THEIR WEDDING. Either you're there to support them, or you're not.

However, you're asking if you're that asshole, and I want to make it clear that you are. YTA. Yes, info was left out. Yes, that sucks. But yes, they should have told you. Now grow up.

Right off of a cliff. \n\nIt's too late now, but you and your friends just ruined his wedding because you want to get drunk. I hope it was worth your friendship.

Some people may not agree with that but it\u2019s a fact that for a lot of people drinking at least two or 3 drinks it\u2019s important in this situation.

If you don\u2019t want to attend, the halfway decent thing to do is ask your friend how much he\u2019s spending per plate with the caterer and give him the money for you and your wife\u2019s plate since he can\u2019t get that money back. (And that\u2019s in addition to whatever you planned on giving as a wedding gift.)\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t expect him to be as close a friend to you going forward.

Who the hell commandeers New Year's Eve for a wedding -- and makes it dry without informing anyone up front?? There's a whole year of other dates to choose from as it is, without expecting people to give up their usual plans for NYE. And I suppose they will expect anniversary events to spoil every future NYE. \n\nNTA for backing out, even at the last minute.

They sound self-centred and entitled -- and awfully dull. \n\nCheers!", "YTA, and not really much of a friend.  I'll never understand how people will put alcohol over friends and family.

You and your wife could have left in enough time to get sloshed before midnight.", "NTA, they changed what you RSVP'd to, so you are not bound by it. They kept it on the down low for a reason and are mad at you because it is hard for them to blame themselves.", "Yeah.  You are the AH.\nNo invitation should have to specify if there is alcohol or not. \nYou assume there is alcohol, maybe try the opposite approach and assume there won't be next time, and then you won't be mad someone else's event isn't going to be held the way you want.\nWhy is it just assumed alcohol is the default?

Needless to say, we were drinking all day and night and were completely wrecked when it came time to go to the wedding. The wedding was at one of those old school vegas wedding chapels. Guess what: those freaking chapels are dry.  And it's not like you just get in and get out. So we had an unpleasant partial sobering up starting at like 10pm. As soon as the wedding was over, we drank heavily again because otherwise we'd have been passing out at like 12:15am in Vegas on NYE.\n\nIf somebody had just told me it was dry I would have brought flask and everything would have been fine. \n\nBut I don't think that's the solution for you.  I'd have gone to the wedding in your shoes, and maybe left early if it's not a late night wedding. I don't think you had to do that because WTF giving no meaningful notice about this, but I can still understand the couple being upset.\n\nI'm going to say NAH", "NTA, the reaction in the group is proof that the failure to communicate this was on the wedding couple.\n\nAnd to the people saying OP must be a raging alcoholic for declining, please remember this is NEW YEARS EVE. It only happens once a year, and lots of people like to use that special occasion to let loose a little bit. Honestly the couple had so fucking nerve to 1) schedule a NYE wedding which is already a bit inconvenient, 2) make it dry and 3) not communicate that clearly or at all.", "YTA honestly", "So, I was going to say you're not his guy's friend, but you never claim to be. You call him a buddy. And your buddy and his girl pulled some shady shit, and lost a bunch of guests. The wedding reception ends at 12:15AM, meaning they specifically wanted everyone to bring in the New Year with them, and then GTFO immediately. It is not weird to expect to toast the New Year or to want to drink at that time. They could have planned it to get everyone out in time to go do other things, but instead, they took the whole evening and hid the fact it was dry. If people knew, they may have gotten way fewer acceptances, but no drop outs. Or giests could have planned to leave by 10 to make other parties, or could have gotten a room to have a party in after.

I often hate people who can\u2019t stop drinking for a night but C\u2019AMON! are you really that selfish to make New Year\u2019s Eve about you?", "Same.

Nothing worse than the father of the groom vomiting at a wedding lmao", "This should be the top comment. OP needs to drink so badly that they can\u2019t spare a few hours? \ud83e\udd74I suspect this has more to do with the toxic friend group disliking the bride rather than the alcohol situation.", "I read a different story where the bride intentionally didn't tell people it was a dry wedding because they didn't want people to sneak their own booze.   (In that case, the Bride was a recovering alcoholic and embarrassed to actually tell people).\n\nNot wanting to have people bring their own supply could be a reason here.\n\nDid the wedding you go to announce that it was dry on the invitations?", "Chances are the venue does not allow outside alcohol & there\u2019s often a hefty fine for it. We explicitly told anyone if they were caught with outside alcohol, they would be repaying us for the $500 fine.", "In another comment, OP stated ceremony is at 5:30 pm and reception ends at 12:15 (so the expectation is all these sober guests have to ring in the new year with the newlyweds, but not champagne)", "Bride and groom also suck for having a wedding at all on NYE. I would be angry to get invited to a wedding on a big holiday. I have family/friend traditions going back a long time. So do lots of people. There\u2019s only so many holidays with the day off work. Rude as hell to have a wedding on NYE.", "So the guests who are bailing are doing so because they RSVP'D yes under false pretenses (that there would be alcohol). Had the invitation said it was a dry wedding, they most likely would have declined the invitation and the couple wouldn't have paid for those plates. \n\nUltimately, the couple is responsible for eating the costs because hiding the dry wedding aspect can be considered a hidden defect that would have changed the answer that was given.", "Seriously, the RSVP is almost the worst thing here. Some people seem to think of wedding invitations like Facebook party invites, like you can just treat a \"yes\" as a \"maybe\" then decide later if you want to go or not.

These folks sound like they are early 20's, not early 30's.

So now there's two overlapping events that typically have booze available, but it won't be there, and they wanted it to be a surprise?", "Agreed NTA People who get married on well established holidays are already a pain. Every year the holiday will be about them. So for that reason alone they are already TA. If they want to have a wedding on a holiday they should expect to incorporate the holiday and for NYE that generally includes the opportunity to drink. I don\u2019t even think they need to provide it, but they could have a cash bar. \n\nI will say of the wedding/reception will be over by early evening then OP could definitely have gone and then gone out for the night afterwards.", "And why would anyone book a *dry* wedding on NYE?? If you want it dry, pick another date!", "I think the main issue with the fact that it\u2019s on NYE\u2026 so was already an inconvenience for people who usually like to celebrate that event their own way. To not even be able to have a glass of champers to ring in the new year would make it even worse. I dare say any other night would have been ok\u2026", "Wish I could gold you, only thing I\u2019d add is they don\u2019t even need to provide the booze, just have a cash bar so those that want can", "This!

His friend paid money for food and for this dude to show up. Hell, OP can have liquor in the parking lot. Share shots. But to end a friendship bc you can't get fucked up on NYE?

I thought that was a given!!", "Exactly. \n\nWhen we were invited to a wedding with a dry reception, we stopped at a liquor store and drank outside the venue. \n\nWe've done flasks...there were other ways. \n\nMy husband says op is a dick that clearly has too much away over the friend group, and I have to agree.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with a dry wedding. I\u2019ve worked several of them. In my experience it\u2019s a 2-4 hour reception tops. Generally people who are older and more religious aren\u2019t big dancers and will only hang around so long. \n\nWhile it\u2019s their wedding, they definitely hid the fact that their NYE reception was going to be dry so people would show up. \n\nI get people grow and change, but how much do the couple have in common?", "The obvious answer to me is to go to the wedding and the first hour or two of the reception. Then leave to a bar and enjoy ringing in NYE.", "You don\u2019t HAVE to stay until 12:15.", "So leave the reception at 9 or 10.", "They definitely suck for planning on a midnight countdown without stating that there will be no alcohol. But I still have to go with YTA for bailing entirely last minute. It is okay to leave early and hit the bars before midnight. And a 7 hour wedding is definitely ridiculous by American standards. I advise apologizing but also informing them that you and your wife will be leaving early due to your own NYE traditions, going to the ceremony, stay for some of the reception, say goodbye with well wishes and go do what you want. \n\nThis is more than one NYE. What you choose to do will likely determine the future of your friendship. And if he means anything at all to you, I really recommend trying to patch this over.", "So you can last minute ditch the whole wedding but you can\u2019t just leave the wedding at 8-9pm?", "What should stop you for leaving at 10pm? It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons. Staying up until midnight is not for everyone, drinking or not", "Wait. What. I\u2019m changing my ruling. Brb", "I mean the wedding couple are definitely lame for having a dry NYE party and not telling anyone\u2026 that being said if your friend was actually important to you then you would still show up as bare minimum common courtesy since they already paid for your plate. \n\nYou can always just bring your own bottle or a flask, you can also leave at 10 to go out\u2026 there were better options than just bailing so close to the event. Seems like a very impulsive reaction because you don\u2019t like the bride. Everyone here is an asshole IMO.\n\nESH", "Yeah, you\u2019re still the AH. You could\u2019ve attended most of it and left early to go drinking if drinking was THAT important to you.", "Okay fine, keep it in your car and go out and drink it.\n\nEdit \n\nJeesh everyone I\u2019m not saying to drive drunk, lots of people coordinate DD\u2019s with their friends/partners. Come on.", "Who are the appropriate authorities to report people sneaking drinks to?

I'd be pissed if I'd planned out DDs, a nice lazy morning after, etc. and found out that it was all unneeded.", "It's possible to believe that weddings should be about the couple and not the booze while also recognizing that for some people, they *are* about the booze. Being clear up front helps prevent problems later.", "For the same reason they should announce any unusual dietary restrictions, restrictions on children \u2013\u00a0so people can plan around it.", "For the same reason that weddings are not about food. But if you are not offering food, you should still announce that there will not be food served.", "I've been with my partner for 16yrs. There are a few reasons why we haven't gotten married but a big one would be the alcohol. His side of the family are of two back grounds that are notoriously alcoholics. The booze bill would be at least half the budget. Nevermind all the BS that comes with it. \n\nCash bar is another way to curb the drinking lol", "Yes they did.\nEveryone knew for a year in advance that it was a dry wedding.  Probably 10 couples I know that got invited didn't attend because of it.", "Big part of why we went outside to have drinks was to minimize that risk.", "Eh, it depends.  We went to a NYE wedding last year, and it was awesome!  The bride and groom love to host events and invited basically their entire extended friend group to celebrate, so most people knew each other and were stoked for an excuse to spend the big holiday together.  It was a huge dance party with all our friends and super fun.\n\nThat said, even as someone who has been sober for almost 2 years, I do think the bride and groom in this situation were AHs for not notifying guests that it would be a dry wedding.  I don't think alcohol should be necessary to enjoy events, but many people do.  I wouldn't host a dry wedding and not notify people in advance, much less one on NYE.", "I feel like they have to assume that if they have it on a holiday people may not come. It's like the same risk as having a destination wedding. It doesn't necessarily make them rude unless they react poorly to people declining the RSVP.", "What\u2019s worse than having a wedding on NYE? Ending it at 11pm without letting guests know they needed to make alternate plans. That\u2019s what my friend did", "That\u2019s my thing, I only get like 8 paid holidays off a year, I\u2019d be upset to have a friend pick a date like this. Plus I just don\u2019t drive on NYE, the roads don\u2019t feel safe, and I haven\u2019t read OP posting anything about how far the wedding is or what the road conditions are generally like this time of year.", "Seems perfect to me. Most of my NYEs are not like the movies, there\u2019s nothing really worth formally dressing up for. Sure, you can go out on the town, but it\u2019s the same places you could go to last month except they\u2019re charging a big cover charge.\n\nThe misstep IMO is a dry wedding on NYE and no plans for shutting it down early to let people go off to an after party. Everyone\u2019s already dressed up. It\u2019d be perfect.", "I disagree. NYE is one of those holidays that I don\u2019t always have plans for. The other holidays I spend with family, but NYE I have pressure to make  exciting plans. It\u2019s hard to get reservations at restaurants. Clubs have expensive covers. Drinks are more expensive. Having a wedding to go to with friends, food, drinks, and a good DJ and dance floor would be great!", "I mean I love NYE. It's my favorite holiday. I could be stoked by a friend having a wedding and then rolling into a countdown. That said I don't have a strong NYE tradition, just whatever seems funnest this year.", "Guaranteed most people will leave early.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a dozen or so dry weddings. Not a single one had many guests after 9:30pm.", "You can leave by 9 and be good.", "A seven-hour wedding on a holiday is BANANAS.", "I think this cements it as ESH. Yes, the bride and groom should have been clear from the beginning, but there's no reason why you and your friend's can't go to the wedding and reception and then reasonably leave before 9:00 and go party the rest of the night somewhere else. Even if the reception venue is a solid 2 hours from a good bar, there would still be plenty of time to find a place and party the rest of the way to the New Year and into the morning.\n\nYall suck for picking booze over your friend. It's clear you aren't a good friend.", "Go to the reception, eat, dance to one song, leave. No reason you need to stay til the end.

Everyone out in 15 minutes!", "Ya those B&G are pure ass hole.  \n\nThey've scheduled a nearly 7 hour event on a holiday were people are expected to socialize, and planned to surprise people that they couldn't drink.", "NTA.  I think this is something that the friend probably hid from everyone knowing they wouldn't attend if they knew, especially on NYE.  That said, yes, they should go to the wedding and leave at 9ish.  I keep seeing that  they're choosing booze over their friend, but I can see where booze may make them much more likely to enjoy themselves at a wedding where only half of the couple is liked.  The dry wedding now only cements her status as unlikable.  And I can totally understand a dry wedding, but on NYE? Like a 4th of July wedding with no fireworks, a Halloween wedding with no costumes, or a Christmas wedding with no Christmas.   It's not that booze is necessary, but its completely expected.  When you have a group with 12 friends that like to socially drink, you are totally hiding it from them.", "NTA. I was gonna say ES\u2026but them scheduling it to go that long and not letting people there would be no alcohol was shitty and seems purposeful.", "I gotta say NTA.  You were deceived on purpose. If they invited you to the wedding they know that keeping this from you and the group could have been a deal breaker. Especially on a holiday.  I believe they hid it on purpose and for that reason you get a pass to pass on the wedding.  Had they been forthcoming yall would have rsvp  no thank you and wouldn't be in this situation.  Or you would at least know what you've signed up for.   NTA. \nWhen information is revealed things change.", "Who stays at a reception for that long!!\n\nYou can attend the wedding and reception and leave right after dinner and still have enough time to get drunk.", "Is there a reason you can't go and then leave after a couple hours? Is drinking a night away more important than seeing your friend get married?", "Ok...so attend the wedding and part of the reception, then go drinking with your friends. Problem solved. You dont NEED to stay for the whole thing. They probably want to spend NYE with all their friends and loved ones, without alcohol.", "If B&G are hosting an event on a traditional party night, AND they'd get upset if people Pre gamed without giving everyone a big heads up about the event being dry and the reasons for it, they're \"I'm the main character people\" and I'd avoid socializing with them anyway.", "I don\u2019t even agree with the notion the couple should have told people it was a dry wedding  - why???? Normal invitations say nothing about their being an open bar. Drinking culture so absolutely out of hand and toooo many people are entitled to things they themselves most likely can\u2019t even afford. It really grinds my gears.", "Fr.
