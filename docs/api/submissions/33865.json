You cannot tell me that this was unintended on the bride/groom part and they're at the \"find out\" stage of fucking around on the invitations.\n\nBuddy probably thought his place was a bit firmer in the group than it is since his fiance entered the picture and thought it would be fine. That's his *own* miscalculation. \n\nYou're going to lose friends as you get older to people that you don't like. You can choose to fight with them about it or just let their path take them.

You could easily leave the wedding by 8 PM, 9 at the latest, and go to a bar. You can also sneak alcohol in purses and pour it in your glasses when no one is looking. Your friend sucks for doing the wedding on a holiday and hiding that it\u2019s dry, but that in itself isn\u2019t a reason to bail last minute when there are simple workarounds.", "Wow. WTF? Alcohol is more important than your friendship? Yeah, YTA. Absolutely pathetic.", "NTA because weddings are assumed to be alcoholic unless specified otherwise.  You weren't given all the information so therefore your \"yes\" was compromised before you even gave it.  People can have their weddings the way they want, but they don't get to dictate/demand others attend, especially if all the info isn't given.\n\nPeople want vegan weddings?  Great!  Don't be upset when meat eaters don't attend, or leave early.  Don't want children at weddings?  Great!  Don't be upset people with parents of small children can't/won't attend.

It's more important to you to get plastered? There is one day your friend is getting married, and dozens of New Years Eves coming your way in future years.\n\nI'm completely mystified by people who get \"pissed off\" when they find out alcohol won't be served at a wedding. I always thought the point was to be with your friends/family on an important day in their lives and celebrate with them. I stand corrected. I now know it nothing more than an excuse to get wasted and anything important the bride and groom are doing is irrelevant. We must drink!", "ESH they should know that no one likes nasty surprises, and finding out that a wedding on NYE is dry is not a nice surprise.  Also hosting a wedding on NYE in general feels pretty off, a bit like having a wedding on Christmas Eve.  However if this guy is a good friend of yours you should support him regardless, as this will likely be a once in a lifetime event for him, and you should want to share in that more than getting drunk.", "YTA. If you can\u2019t bear to go that one time without drinking then you sound like you have an alcoholism problem. Although frankly I think the main problem is you just don\u2019t like her, and this is a convenient excuse to not attend. Maybe this guy is better off without you and the others who cancelled, the other four are clearly better friends to him than the rest of you.", "YTA. You\u2019re not there for your friend at an important time in his life. You\u2019ve put drinking above your friendship. \nYou could easily go to the wedding, stay for dinner and then leave the reception for a bar. Not tough to do both.", "I mean, the friend is  kind of a AH for NYE wedding that's the 1st problem. But also your the AH for skipping it because of the no booze at such a late notice. Wedding are mad expensive these days. You could also pocket a flask and bounce once the dancing begins, ya know. ESH. Not stating on the invite its NA for an obvious drinking holiday wedding is a trash move, they knew what they were doing, trying to pull a fast one. ESH", "YTA here sorry bud. Yes he should have warned you and yeah it\u2019s shit, but you\u2019ve essentially told him one night of booze is more important than him. And he\u2019s right about it the expense. I think this will be friendship ending, as he clearly means so little to you all (who backed out). If it were me I would have sucked it up, attended until midnight and then went out to a bar afterwards, or gone boxing on Jan 1st whilst is always really awesome (so many day party events)", "Jesus Christ.

Prima Donna that shit. Much better for everyone.", "YTA. Nice friend you are that you want to back out because no alcohol. You, your wife and friends sound like alcoholics. If you can only party with alcohol, you have a problem. Since being drunk is more important to you then your friends wedding.\n\nShould they have mentioned that there wouldnt be alcohol. DOES IT EVEN MATTER?! You go to support your friend on his wedding day. That is what matters and getting drunk isnt. \n\nYou are not a friend. If i was the groom, i would cut all ties with you and these so called friends.", "You may want to examine why a dry wedding is such an affront to you and your wife. \n\nNTA, but weddings are a blending of two people, not a boozy shindig. Don't understand why y'all are mad. Their wedding is THEIR WEDDING. Either you're there to support them, or you're not.

However, you're asking if you're that asshole, and I want to make it clear that you are. YTA. Yes, info was left out. Yes, that sucks. But yes, they should have told you. Now grow up.

Right off of a cliff. \n\nIt's too late now, but you and your friends just ruined his wedding because you want to get drunk. I hope it was worth your friendship.

Some people may not agree with that but it\u2019s a fact that for a lot of people drinking at least two or 3 drinks it\u2019s important in this situation.

If you don\u2019t want to attend, the halfway decent thing to do is ask your friend how much he\u2019s spending per plate with the caterer and give him the money for you and your wife\u2019s plate since he can\u2019t get that money back. (And that\u2019s in addition to whatever you planned on giving as a wedding gift.)\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t expect him to be as close a friend to you going forward.

Who the hell commandeers New Year's Eve for a wedding -- and makes it dry without informing anyone up front?? There's a whole year of other dates to choose from as it is, without expecting people to give up their usual plans for NYE. And I suppose they will expect anniversary events to spoil every future NYE. \n\nNTA for backing out, even at the last minute.

They sound self-centred and entitled -- and awfully dull. \n\nCheers!", "YTA, and not really much of a friend.  I'll never understand how people will put alcohol over friends and family.

You and your wife could have left in enough time to get sloshed before midnight.", "NTA, they changed what you RSVP'd to, so you are not bound by it. They kept it on the down low for a reason and are mad at you because it is hard for them to blame themselves.", "Yeah.  You are the AH.\nNo invitation should have to specify if there is alcohol or not. \nYou assume there is alcohol, maybe try the opposite approach and assume there won't be next time, and then you won't be mad someone else's event isn't going to be held the way you want.\nWhy is it just assumed alcohol is the default?

Needless to say, we were drinking all day and night and were completely wrecked when it came time to go to the wedding. The wedding was at one of those old school vegas wedding chapels. Guess what: those freaking chapels are dry.  And it's not like you just get in and get out. So we had an unpleasant partial sobering up starting at like 10pm. As soon as the wedding was over, we drank heavily again because otherwise we'd have been passing out at like 12:15am in Vegas on NYE.\n\nIf somebody had just told me it was dry I would have brought flask and everything would have been fine. \n\nBut I don't think that's the solution for you.  I'd have gone to the wedding in your shoes, and maybe left early if it's not a late night wedding. I don't think you had to do that because WTF giving no meaningful notice about this, but I can still understand the couple being upset.\n\nI'm going to say NAH", "NTA, the reaction in the group is proof that the failure to communicate this was on the wedding couple.\n\nAnd to the people saying OP must be a raging alcoholic for declining, please remember this is NEW YEARS EVE. It only happens once a year, and lots of people like to use that special occasion to let loose a little bit. Honestly the couple had so fucking nerve to 1) schedule a NYE wedding which is already a bit inconvenient, 2) make it dry and 3) not communicate that clearly or at all.", "YTA honestly", "So, I was going to say you're not his guy's friend, but you never claim to be. You call him a buddy. And your buddy and his girl pulled some shady shit, and lost a bunch of guests. The wedding reception ends at 12:15AM, meaning they specifically wanted everyone to bring in the New Year with them, and then GTFO immediately. It is not weird to expect to toast the New Year or to want to drink at that time. They could have planned it to get everyone out in time to go do other things, but instead, they took the whole evening and hid the fact it was dry. If people knew, they may have gotten way fewer acceptances, but no drop outs. Or giests could have planned to leave by 10 to make other parties, or could have gotten a room to have a party in after.

I've been called an asshole among other things for \"leading the charge\" in people not going to the wedding.\u00a0 AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No one will die if they happen to go one night without it. You can also drink a few at your hotel/home before you attend the wedding.\n\nI guess you all aren\u2019t that good of friends when you were only willing to support your friend because you thought he\u2019d be footing the bill for you and your wife to drink yourselves silly. I am not a vegetarian either, but this also reminds me of the AH who refuse to go to vegetarian or vegan weddings because heaven forbid they have to go one meal without meat.", "ESH. Since you RSVP months ago, they\u2019ve already paid for your meals, and it\u2019s last minute, you should pay for you and your wives meal. Otherwise the friendship won\u2019t survive.", "I don\u2019t understand why people think they need to be drunk to celebrate their friends. Like you guys can\u2019t have a good time without it? Seriously? \n\nMy unpopular opinion is YTA", "YTA, and truly not a friend. If your relationship and a wedding is defined by you having a beer. Well there\u2019s that.", "New years eve weddings are great. All your friends in one place with music and people you love? An organised party so you don't have to plan anything? Free food? Getting dressed up? It's actually the best idea. But hey, I love weddings and I love joy, so.", "Yup.  They pull this shit, and then they'll blame the new wife for breaking up the friendship.", "Honestly I\u2019m not much of a drinker but the lying alone, as well as the idea of being told as a grown-ass woman whether I\u2019m allowed to drink at an event, would make me not go. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the alcohol, it\u2019s about recognizing that asking your friends to come to your wedding on a night that traditionally already has significance to other people is already an imposition, and then doing your best not to create more inconvenience.", "I completely agree with your points. The only thing that gives me hesitation is for all we know the bride and groom would have been equally as upset if their guests showed up buzzed/drunk at an event where people are supposed to remain sober. OP would have to ask about that. If the bride and groom are cool with that, then you\u2019re solution of pre-gaming is spot on.", "yeah, THIS. ESH for those reasons", "Can people ever have one event without getting loaded? Seriously big freaking deal. Go to rehab man. You can\u2019t drink at a wedding oh the horror! How dare you! Not get shit faced? Wtf is wrong with people? Unless you\u2019re a drunk who can\u2019t make it one day or know how to enjoy yourself without getting loaded what\u2019s the problem here?", "Exactly. They should all just bring their own stanley cups full of booze. And keep the booze in their car. They can refill when needed for free.", "Disagree, etiquette dictates that any mention of alcohol or bar style be left off of a wedding invite.  \nYou want to know you ask.", "You\u2019re delusional lol", "Nope, read it again and guess i missed part of talking another 2/3 of his friends out of going too.\n\nYTA, unequivocally", "Depends on the rules of the venue. Some are pretty strict with that.", "I\u2019m sure they will be serving other kind of beverages in the wedding. It is about supporting his friend. I would go to the ceremony and go to the reception and stay for a little bit. I drink socially but I would definitely go to a dry wedding if it were my friend getting married. If I want to drink I can do it after", ">What kind of \u201cfriend\u201d can\u2019t stay sober for a few hours for a friend on his wedding day?\n\nAn alcoholic one.", "Thank you! I\u2019m surprised by all the N T A and E S H votes. If one night without alcohol will kill you, you have problems. And if op knew that the bride was conservative Christian it probably would\u2019ve been a safe assumption that it was a dry wedding. As for having a wedding on a holiday, I got married on Valentine\u2019s Day. Wedding was at 530-6 and people were gone by 9. It\u2019s not that big of a deal to at least eat, stay a while, then go for a drink. OP absolutely should offer to cover the cost of his wasted plate, and probably kiss his friendship goodbye.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And I think it\u2019s AH of the bride & groom to expect their guests to stay for over 6 hours at a dry wedding on NYE. I can\u2019t think of anything more boring.", "Btw not indicating it's a dry wedding is. Eth common when one or more parties is Muslim. May be the case here too", "If they did not want to go to the wedding they only had to say no. If you think a wedding is crappy and boring without alcohol then just don't go. RSVP with a \"no\". No one wants a bunch of guests in their 30s getting wasted while pretending to be there to support their \"friend\". If you only have the kind of friends that you need to drink to be around I think you need to change your friends group. Or they need to exclude you. Or both.", "Thank you!!! I feel a lot of these people haven\u2019t planned a wedding. OP is NTA but the bride and groom are 1000% are, that needs to be communicated way in advance, on top of plus ones, kid free, wedding food options, and travel arrangements, so guest can prepare.", "OP is no friend at all, clearly.", "Friend is marrying into a Mormon family probably, better they don't support it.", "He just saved the groom from having to figure out who his real friends are.", "Idk, I like a nice wine with my meal - not to sneak booze like a shifty teenager.  I wouldn't want to bring a flask."]}
