I have legal guardianship over her, but still involve my parents in big/permanent decisions. But things like allowing her to hang out or punishments are all up to me and it\u2019s never been a problem until about 2 weeks ago. \n\nAmy is a grade ahead in school so most of her friends are 1-2 years older. She\u2019s most close with a girl \u201cMeg\u201d (17f).  I don\u2019t mind Meg. She comes over for sleepovers often. Sometimes she makes bad decisions but overall she\u2019s sweet and respectful so I never felt the need to not allow them to be friends. \n\nI let Amy go to a classmates party with Meg and Meg was the driver. Apparently at the party Meg got really drunk and tried to drive back to my house where they were gonna have a sleepover but Amy thankfully stopped her and tried to drive home herself. \n\nI\u2019ve given Amy driving lessons before but Megs car is stick. On the way home she lost control and they hit a tree. Meg got a concussion and a broken leg and Amy broke her arm and fractured her collar bone. \n\nThey\u2019re alive that\u2019s all that matters but I was livid. I always give Amy my spare card when she goes out in case she needs food or wants to give her friends gas or WHATEVER. When I got to the hospital they confirmed she wasn\u2019t drinking or doing any drugs but I still let her have it. \n\nI yelled at her for not getting an Uber or at least calling me so I could Uber there and drive them home. I tell her all the time if she or a friend drinks to call me and I won\u2019t be mad. I\u2019ll get them home safe and we can deal with it later. \n\nAmy said she was scared I wouldn\u2019t let Meg over if I saw her drunk and Meg refused to leave her car so they tried to just sneak back. \n\nI grounded her for a month and I took her phone. She can have it during school hours for emergencies but she has to give it to me when she gets back home. She says it\u2019s unfair and I told her clearly she\u2019s too stupid to use it so she doesn\u2019t need it. I did apologize for that shortly after I said it I know that was way too far. But I\u2019m still holding firm. \n\nMy parents say I\u2019m doing too much and I told them if they don\u2019t like it they can send her to someone else or take her with them and homeschool. Obviously I don\u2019t want Amy gone but you can\u2019t expect me to raise someone then get mad when I enforce rules. \n\nThey said we will all talk when they get back in a few weeks. I don\u2019t get how I\u2019m wrong when Amy could have hurt herself more or god knows who else all because she didn\u2019t want to Uber or make a phone call.

She could have killed someone so your parents should be happy that nothing else happened .  how drunk was her friend that she thought driving without a license it better", "Okay so, I\u2019m your age with a girl 12. \n\nLook, I get that you\u2019re pissed and a lot of that comes from fear BUT! You\u2019re telling her that she should have called you or gotten an Uber. She\u2019s telling you she was scared of how you would react. In this situation you have reacted badly, reenforcing that fear. If put in that position again she would likely do exactly the same thing. \n\nHave you talked to her about the things she did right? She\u2019s 15. Her brain isn\u2019t developed and she has very little understanding of consequences yet. (Doesn\u2019t come for a few years, she\u2019s still developing) \n\nShe: didn\u2019t let her friend drive drunk! She refused and attempted to get them both home safe. She\u2019s had some driving lessons and due to being a child didn\u2019t think it through and didn\u2019t realise the consequences and trust me! The lesson is in the crash and injury. \n\nAs for your parents? You\u2019re ABSOLUTELY right in what you said to them. You have guardianship, they\u2019re either parents or they\u2019re not. They\u2019re chosen not to be and have handed that job over to you. \n\nSo, you DO have full authority on this one. \n\n\nLook, you and your sister are both pretty scared from all of this. Sometimes the punishment is in the immediate consequence and consequences SHOULD always reflect the crime. I don\u2019t know how taking her phone teaches her to ask you for help. I took my kids phone because she kept doing the dishes badly for weeks and weeks so she could get back to Roblox. Well, no phone no rushing. \n\nIn this case, if a punishment IS necessary (I don\u2019t think it is, trust me she\u2019s scared the sh!t out of herself) it would be\u2026. If you want to go out I\u2019m driving you there and back from now on. I\u2019ll take you at 7 and the Uber will be there at 11 to pick you up. If you can\u2019t make safe choices to get home then you lose the privilege of working that out yourself which unfortunate means you need to work around my work/ sleep schedule not your own. \n\nBut, reacting badly won\u2019t get her to call you. Quite the opposite she will just get better at hiding it.", "NTA. Have your parents always shirked from parenting? I don't mean in the \"dump a teen on her sister\" sense, but in the \"not enforcing consequences for fucking up\" sense. Amy is x lucky if there aren't any serious legal consequences out of this. Over here she could kiss her license hornby until her twenties and go broke on paying damages.", "Tough situation OP\n\nI'm not sure grounding fixes things but you're NTA for trying your best \n\nThe older friends at the age must really suck, but also they could have died", "NTA \n\nShe was great in not letting Meg drive drunk. \n\nShe was great in that she didn\u2019t drink at 15\n\nBut she was scared to call you! That\u2019s a problem as she is 15, hanging with 17 year olds and is bound to get caught in some dodgy situations. \n\nYou are correct to take her phone and have some punishment. I mean she could have been seriously injured or killed or killer someone else. What she did was terrible and she needs to understand that. \n\nBut she also needs to know she can call you to make sure she is safe. \n\nYou did the right thing but you also need to talk with her so next time she will 100% call you. She needs to know, sure you won\u2019t be impressed with Meg, but Meg is acting like a 17 year old and it\u2019s to be be expected and your 15 year old needs to know how to handle that with your help", "Ehhhh NAH. What she did was irresponsible. The fact is she managed to cause a terrible one car accident after a party. She\u2019s 15, she can\u2019t even have a full drivers license yet!\n\nAnd she might not know how to drive stick, but poor shifting doesn\u2019t wrap a car around a tree. \n\nIn general it is best when kids experience logical consequences and not arbitrary punishments. Taking away her license for some time, re-attending drivers ed classes, working to pay back any damage done are all logical consequences that might help her experience the effect of what she has done more deeply.   \n\nLosing her phone is not obviously a logical consequence. So she deserves any punishment coming her way, but you could still have an open mind as to what they should be.", "There have only been a few comments, but I can see the direction the wind is blowing. That you will be declared the asshole. I'm personally having a hard time choosing between NAH and a light YTA.\n\nAs others have said, you're focusing on the negative. Yes, she should have called you, but it also sounds like she was hesitant to do that or call an Uber herself since her friend was refusing to leave her car, and that definitely would have ended in somebody drunk driving. I've been in that situation myself so it's a big catch-22. \n\nHowever, choosing to drive a stick was obviously the wrong choice, so she should have just called you on the down low and let you handle the situation when you arrived, despite the anger that she would have gotten from her friend.\n\nDouble however, there's a huuuuuuge part of this story that should disqualify her from anything more than a mildest punishment: she didn't drink! She's 15 at a party with peer pressure undoubtedly flying all over the place and she didn't drink. Having grown up surrounded by alcoholism and drunk driving, I can tell you that that trumps everything else, including the accident itself. \n\nThe accident was an accident. Her sobriety was chosen. Good on her.", "NTA and you are absolutely right in how you handled her and your parents.", "Public service announcement for all the parents who are sure this will never be their kid so they never have to have the conversation:\n\nHave the conversation.\n\nLet you kid know that if there's ever an issue with alcohol or drugs and they have to out of a scary or uncomfortable situation or to get home, they must call you.  Let them know that even if they've made some bad (even terrible) decisions and they smell like a dispensary, they mustn't compound those decisions but making themselves even less safe by driving or getting in a car with someone who's impaired.  \n\nThis doesn't have to be a get out of jail free card, although it does have to be a \"I will control myself and will not have a fit on the spot and we'll talk about it calmly the next day and I won't ground you for the rest of your life\" card.\n\nHave the conversation.\n\nP.S.  I think that OP is NTA.  Yup, she lost it, and she certainly could have responded better, but WTF, she's a 32 Y.O. who's been deputized to raise a teenager who could have killed her friend, or herself, or be paralyzed, and could still be in serious legal trouble.  And yeah, the 15 y.o. brain isn't fully formed and Amy will be really really pissed off at the OP and hey she already has a broken collar bone, but there is no way in hell that child didn't realize that what she was doing was dangerous, and stupid, and that she had alternatives.  She just wanted to sneak her drunk friend into her house, so what the hell?   (If the parents don't like it, I would strongly suggest that they consider raising their own child.)", "YTA. She's a kid. She tried to be responsible and didn't get in a car with someone who was drunk. You should be thanking God she's smart enough to not do that not call her an idiot. A month and no phone because she can't drive stick? Way over the top. You are only showing her that when she messes up (even when she's trying to do the right thing) that you aren't reasonable or someone she can go to. This was a teaching moment and you're teaching her the wrong thing.", "Soft YTA. You are right to be scared and furious at their negligent actions, but, over punishment doesn't lead to correct behaviour. If you had approached this moment with sincerity, Amy would realise you are a trusted guardian going forward. Next time she fucks up, as a fifteen year old is liable to, she won't trust you and try to hide it better. And you won't know what's going wrong in her life. And she NEEDS a trusted guardian going forward.\n\nShe still deserves punishment of some sort, don't get me wrong, what she did was dangerous and she should have never done what she did. But your reaction isn't going to get the desired outcome you think it is. I would apologise to her. Sit her down and explain what she did was horrifically negligent and could have gotten themselves killed or someone else killed. That she did wrong and she will be punished for it. But you apologise for going too far, you were scared and angry and want to make sure she is safe. That if in the future, you want her to trust you to take her out of a dangerous situation, and not to hide it from you. That's what'll stand out. \n\nThis is a formative moment. The difference between Amy ending up in a situation and feels she can't confide in you for help, or, her first thought when she needs help.", "Soft YTA. I understand you're mad, this must've been a shock and so much more could've happened. But I bet Amy has learned their lesson. Don't risk your relationship and trust with her by overly punishing her. The only thing I might work on further is teaching her setting boundaries with older friends. She might be easily influenced due to the age gap", "YTA. If she was afraid to call you before, she sure as hell isn\u2019t going to now that she knows you can\u2019t control your temper and the punishment won\u2019t fit the crime. And \u201cstupid\u201d is going to ring in her head for a long, long time. Your apology is worthless because you meant it when you said it.", "N T A for punishing her as she was irresponsible. I think taking the phone may be excessive - she's injured and grounded as it is - but that's your decision. But:\n\n'When I got to the hospital they confirmed she wasn\u2019t drinking or doing any drugs but I still let her have it.\n\nI yelled at her'\n\nYTA for this. I understand you were worried and emotions were running high, but shouting at someone in hospital is poor behaviour at best. You want her to come to you in these kind of situations- shouting really defeats the purpose. \n\n'I told her clearly she\u2019s too stupid to use it so she doesn\u2019t need it'\n\nGreat that you apologised but again you're showing a lack of self control here.", "She broke her Arm and your first reaction was to yell at her? \nYta.", "Yta. The natural repercussions of this event was more than enough. Punishing her for something like this is just going to make her 1. Resent you and 2. Not trust you enough to come to you if anything like this was to come up again", "Soft YTA. As a parent of teenagers I absolutely understand your anger and horror at what might have happened- she should have called you and ignored her drunk friend. But peer pressure is huge at that age. \n\nBy all means tell her off- but the extreme punishment means that you're going to make her reluctant to call you in an emergency in the future.", "I think YTA.\n\nYou seem more strict than you lead yourself to believe. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t call. Because she firmly believed you would cut her friend out of her life. Which by the way you worded things seems like you have considered at some point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them home safe AND deal with it later\u201d doesn\u2019t sound very punishment free does it. \n\nYou seem to focus on punish punish punish rather than build positive reinforcement\n\n\nAlso taking a kids phone for a month over this while they are literally injured? Jesus Christ. That kid is going to resent you for the rest of their life, even if it\u2019s not noticeable on the surface. Have some heart.

MASSIVELY. She didn't call you because you obviously have anger issues. She was smart enough to know exactly how you'd respond if she told you a friend wanted to drive drunk. She just didn't understand how different a stick is from manual. You're punishing her for not trusting you but don't even have the emotional intelligence to understand what you're angry about. That poor girl is in hell because you're less emotionally mature than she is", "NTA but this is kind of a hard situation to be in.  The main issue is you're her sister and she will never view you as a parent. My sister is 12 years older than me and as a kid she always tried to act holier than thou and would immediately run to my mom to snitch on me for doing things she did when she was my age and got away with.   This led to huge resentments towards her that still exist almost 3 decades later.", "YTA\n\nShe is 15 and stopped her drunk friend from getting behind the wheel.

She made a mistake, and she's grounded and phone-revoked to show that you are serious.  That's not unreasonable at her age.  \n\nI would make sure to have a conversation with her reiterating the above:  \"CALL ME and I won't be mad.  CALL ME and be safe.  I will be mad \\*only\\* if you DON'T CALL ME and put yourself in a dangerous situation instead.\"  Stress this to her.  Point out what happened as the example.  Tell her that she wouldn't be grounded and phone-revoked if she had just called you and that you would have picked her and Meg up, and that you understand these situations because you were a teen once, too.  But that you love her and need her to be safe.\n\nAlso apologize for calling her stupid.  That's your only fuck-up in this situation.\n\nIt is way, way better for her to learn this now.  And you're awesome.", "YTA I know you are scared about what happened, but you can\u2019t put that onto her. She was trying to be responsible. Problem solving is not great at that age but she was sober and got into the accident trying to prevent her friend from driving drunk. Of possible outcomes, that one is probably \u201cokay\u201d. \n\nYour mind is clouded with the bad instead of seeing the responsible things she did.

The possible outcome that the sister ignored and would have prevented injuries was to call OP, which was an option the sister knew about but didn\u2019t take advantage of.\n\nETA: NTA", "Almost killing herself and her friend by wrapping the car around a tree at 15 is apparently the responsible thing?\n\nI understand the \"not letting your drunk friend drive\" part was pretty OK, but then she immediately followed it with a dangerous blunder.\n\nThis sub is gonna be the end of me, I swear.", "Amy has OP's credit card with her so she can call an Uber.\n\nAt 15, your impulses aren't great yet, but I worry if her first impulse, when friend can't drive, is to say \"OK I'll drive then even though I don't have a licence or any experience with stick shifts and could kill someone lol\". That thought shouldn't be crossing her mind AT ALL.\n\nThis is exactly the sort of behaviour that warrants relatively harsh punishment. I can sort of agree that taking her phone for a month is too much, but OP was very understandably upset.\n\nI'd have given the phone back after a long hard lecture, but that doesn't make her TA enough by a long shot. \n\nNTA.", "Developmentally, scientifically that part of her brain isn\u2019t developed yet.

People generally don't like having broken arms.", "Which is why the adult is in charge and tries to mold the situation. Op would be remiss if she continues to let sis hang out with older drunk friends while sis is 15.", "This isn\u2019t policing this is parenting. Yes, a broken arm is a hell of a learnt lesson for a child and a first offence where to the best of her abilities tried to do the right thing. \n\nIntention matters.", "The girl is a grade ahead in school man.
