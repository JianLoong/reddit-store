Not everyone knows yet, because I have PCOS and I\u2019ve been worried about being able to carry to term. Needless to say, we are very excited. Now onto the issue.\u00a0\n\nMy husband and I had VERY different upbringings as children. His parents could not be nicer if they tried, and treated me like their daughter before we were even engaged. But my family? Not so much. My father was authoritarian, emotionally abusive (I didn\u2019t realize at the time, but every friend or specialist I\u2019ve talked to has described him as such), and neglected to spend time with us. My mom was by all accounts a wonderful SAH mom, and a caring woman. Her only flaw is that she NEVER stood up for us when my dad was being a jerk. She would tell us in private that she agreed with us, but it \u201cwasn\u2019t her place\u201d to question him.\u00a0\n\nMy dad has gotten better since they became empty nesters, but he still doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong with the way he raised us (maybe one or two things). If we bring it up, he says that children always complain about their parents, and it won\u2019t make a difference to apologize now. And I completely disagree.\u00a0\n\nBeing loved by my wonderful husband, being around his family, and having this life growing inside me made me realize how horrible my upbringing really was. My biggest goal in life is to be nothing like my parents when it comes to my kids. That being said, my parents were overjoyed to hear about their first grandbaby. They talked about how I could always leave my kid with them if my Husband and I ever needed a babysitter, and I immediately felt cold. I had flashbacks of all the yelling, all the times I felt neglected and unloved,their strict rules and punishments. And it must have showed on my face, because my dad asked if something was wrong. I tried to brush it off, saying my husbands family was closer so we would probably use them, but he didn\u2019t buy it. He asked if we had a problem leaving our child with them. Hormones got the better of me, and I answered. I said I didn\u2019t trust them to leave my child alone with them. I didn\u2019t believe they would treat my child better than how they treated me, and I didn\u2019t want my child to ever feel like I felt.\u00a0\n\nThey were surprised. My mom got misty eyed, and my dad was shocked, asking why I would say something like that. I once again, reminded him of all the stuff he did as a dad. He said \u201cthat\u2019s all in the past, I don\u2019t understand why it matters now\u201d. At this, I slammed my hands of the table and yelled \u201cTHIS is why it matters!! You don\u2019t listen, you\u2019ve NEVER listened! Why the fuck would I trust you to listen to my feelings/boundaries when it comes to MY child when you can\u2019t even pretend to care about my feelings when I was YOUR child!?\u201d.
