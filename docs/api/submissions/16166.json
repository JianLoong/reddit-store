If someone wants to sneak it in, that is on them and will never be enough to get people truly wasted.

That is not to say if money is not a factor and you want the party atmosphere then that\u2019s ok too. \n\nHowever a wedding is about the bride and groom. It\u2019s about how they want their day to go. As guest our job is to show up and love and support them. It may not be the wedding of your dreams because it\u2019s not its theirs.

It will also save you a lot on catering, because alcohol is pricey.", "NTA! there was a person on here at one point who only intended to have water and was refusing soda etc bc they didn\u2019t drink it. your situation is not that. if your wedding guests can\u2019t have fun without getting drunk then the problem is with them, not you.", "NTA. When my husband and I married, I drank very rarely, and my husband doesn't drink at all. We did a BYOB reception. It was a vary small, backyard wedding, and we provided no alcohol at all.", "NTA\nAlcohol is a terrible drug. Weddings allow people to be drunk, then aggressive and rude .

You never say in your post that you wouldn't allow others to bring in alcohol, you're just not comfortable providing unlimited amounts of it and you are in no way obligated to do so. \n\nI've been to two weddings in my life, a family wedding where all my uncles drank way too much and it was terrible and the wedding of my dad's best friend to a woman who was a Seventh Day Adventist and as a result the wedding was dry. The second wedding was way more fun for me as a kid, no one was scarily drunk, everyone had fun without alcohol and it was fun to drink sparkling cider with everyone else and pretend to be an adult. \n\nYou're being really reasonable and it would be worth asking your friends to have fun with the amount of alcohol available and not make this a bigger thing than it has to be.  You would be within your rights to point out that you're the ones getting married and this is the kind of wedding you want would (I don't think that sound bridezilla-y at all).\n\nI hope your wedding goes well and you don't have to deal with anyone ridiculously drunk.

She wanted no drunks at her wedding as she had been hit by a drunk driver a few years before. Everyone was fine except for one family bunch and they were pointed to the nearest dive bar and bid adios.  Enjoy your wedding OP, best wishes.", "Your wedding, your rules. It\u2019s fine for you to not serve alcohol, it\u2019s also ok if people chose not to come over this (and you should see this as a blessing as you know what kind of friend they are). \n\nNTA and congratulations, I hope you have a wonderful wedding OP.", "NTA, just make sure to include it on the invitation- I\u2019ve seen a couple of reddit threads where people have said they were pissed off to get to a wedding and find it is dry, and that they would have RSVPd no if they had known", "I\u2019ll never understand why people think weddings are an excuse to get wasted on someone else\u2019s dime.", "Totally okay!\nJust make sure the fun to be had isn\u2019t alcohol centered minus the alcohol - ie instead of a club vibe with a DJ and lights off have yard games and crafts", "YTA just because you are an alcoholic does not mean everybody coming to your wedding is.", "NTA, it seems to be more common here lately to serve beer and wine only and to end alcohol service after the meal is served.", "NTA. But just so you know, you will probably have a very short reception.", "NTA. No one is obligated to serve anything at any event, much less alcohol.", "NTA I would tell them that you are planning on having an officer with a breathalyzer available for anyone who drinks too much/brings in their own liquor so they can safely be assured they are ok to drive home. Many police departments would even accommodate this request if you choose to go through with it. Plus the presence of LE will dissuade any crazy drunkenness.", "NTA But make it a morning wedding. Getting sloshed is less acceptable at 10am.", "NTA! \n\nIt's *your* wedding. \n\nI think it's very generous of you to even do the wine. I am a heavy social drinker and wouldn't dream of sneaking booze into friends wedding who decided they needed to be sober. Don't invite these horrid people.", "NTA\n\nI think anyone is threatens or jokes sneak alcohol and you can push back. Ask why they would do that to you. Tell them if they really have that little respect for you and your choices and maybe ultimately it\u2019s best that they celebrate your marriage at home with their own bottles of alcohol.\n\nI really don\u2019t see why people need alcohol at weddings. I feel like if we can go to work without drinking, and our work is probably some of the most stressful parts of our life, we can survive a five hour wedding ceremony, and reception without it too. If they\u2019re really that desperate for a drink, maybe I should just bottoms off at home after.", "NTA for having limited alcohol, but be clear to everyone before they get there", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"one friend said he would sneak alcohol into the wedding\" .. uninvite him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo these compulsive drinkers can not survive ONE evening invitation without drinking?", "I was going to have a daytime wedding (like 10am with a huge lunch spread) because having people get wasted at my wedding (and they would have) gave me so much anxiety. Instead I eloped. \n\nNTA.", "\"...are the type to get wasted at any special occasion.\"\n\nAhhh yeah. I know the type. They are called \"drunks.\"\n\nNTA.\n\n\n.", "NTA", "Exactly. She can make her own rules all she wants, but I\u2019m not sticking around for a dry reception.", "I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d be the AH for not disclosing it before hand. Bride and groom are publicly known not to drink. If anyone has major problems that reeks of a them problem.", "This is so real! Thanks for getting it", "You shouldn't need alcohol to have fun", "It blows my mind too, honestly. Seeing so many of my friends, my age and even younger, fall into alcoholism without even realizing it pushed along my decision to quit drinking, as well. It was all fun and games, for a while, and now I know far too many people that can\u2019t go even one day without drinking. They, of course, are in denial about having a problem. Always saying \u201cI could quit whenever I want,\u201d but never even attempting a break.", "Tbh I will never cease being stunned by by this. Is it this unbearable to have a nice dinner with friends and family without alcohol?", "Funny you choose to respond to a post claiming a religious background that probably hates the LGBTQ community, are you banning them from your wedding as well?", "Yes. Especially MY family.", "You are funny. I come from a religious background and I\u2019m also bisexual.", "As a matter of fact, my \u201cbest man\u201d and best friend is nonbinary. And I\u2019ve been thinking I\u2019m going to ask my lesbian minister aunt to officiate the wedding.", "Thank you <3 Have a wonderful wedding!"]}
