Simple solution, problem solved without causing family problems. Tell step sis you cannot afford to pay for her supplies and she need to store some at your house for future use.  If she doesn't it is not your problem.  Just don't leave yours easy to find.  If she asked just say no or say you are out of supplies. This seems so simple.  I don't understand why it is so hard for you to figure out.", "Which parent of yours is shared with your step sister?\n\nThey need to provide her with products, or give you some money and you buy enough for her as well.", "NTA.  Leave just one downstairs and one upstairs so she can cover an emergency and has the ability to go get her own at that point.  Hide the rest.  Or get a lockbox....", "NTA she's 19. Does she not have a job or any kind of income?", "Have you tried talking to her about it? Like hey, let me know if it's low or out.\n\nAnd for those going on about at her age she should know her cycle better, not everyone has regular periods, so theyre sometimes very hard to track", "She knows when her cycle is, it's ridiculous to think she doesn't have something on her to deal with it. She's just happy to abuse your good will - as long as you keep leaving your supplies in the bathrooms, she'll keep using them.\n\nNTA for hiding the items you pay for. She can use her own.", "NTA. \nAs someone who buys the more expensive brand, I can understand your frustration. While she may not work, she gets money (from understanding based off a comment reply you made) and she should be buying her own supplies and keep some on her for when she is in a sticky situation and won\u2019t have to use yours. \nYour mom made a good suggestion! I back her up on it, and don\u2019t think you would be the AH for moving them for your use only.", "Who is her parent? She is used to being home where her other parent buys it and stocks it so she probably doesn't have any idea how much they cost and isn't used to buying her own.\n\nIf you live with her father, you and your mother need to have a serious talk with both of them. In your family, period supplies are bought by individuals. So if she needs period supplies, she needs to ask Dad to provide them or she needs to buy them herself or bring them. It is not appropriate for her to steal yours without asking since you are buying your own.", "Someone\u2019s the asshole but I am not sure who.\n\nDo you buy your own toilet paper and make guests bring their own?\n\nSanitary supplies should come out of the household budget and be available for any woman needing them.\n\nLike toilet paper or hand soap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I kept a spare box in my car ffs.\n\nSupplies are way too expensive as it is and if she buys higher quality just for step sister to use it like they're limitless, she has every right to be pissed and hide them.

You\u2019re saying that a house full of men should have a stock of sanitary supplies in preparation that a female might might visit. Why would a house full of men stock sanitary supplies. Why should she supply sister pads when sister doesn\u2019t live there and she knows she\u2019s on her period. Sister needs to be a responsible adult and supply her own personal needs.", "At that point, she could knock on your door and ask for two to get through until morning.
