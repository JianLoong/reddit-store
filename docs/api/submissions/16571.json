My wife was as on board as me. We even arranged to pay my brother's back rent. He still had to move but there is no eviction on his record. That was agreed upon as part of paying off the back rent. My brother doesn't have a criminal record, before he got laid off he always had a job, he doesn't use illegal drugs and he's a responsible person. Me and my wife didn't think it would be a problem letting him stay until he found another job. \n\nMy brother has been here since March 1. My wife is a paramedic. She works rotating shifts so sometimes she sleeps during the day because she's working at night. My brother is loud. It's a problem and it's disturbing her sleep. I understand that my brother is used to living alone and not used to someone sleeping during the day so my wife gave him a grace period to get used to it. Even with me or my wife constantly reminding him he's not changing. He always says he's sorry and will be quiet going forward, but he never is. My job requires me to be out of the house half the time and working from home half the time. My wife is not a light sleeper but even the first time I worked from home during the day I saw what she meant. My wife is definitely not being critical of my brother.\n\nHe keeps the television loud, plays his music loud, he stomps around and jumps and has loud footsteps and talks loudly or yells. It doesn't matter how many times he's reminded, but the situation can't go on. My wife can't sleep properly unless she's sleeping the same hours that my brother is, which is not often because of her rotating shifts. Even when she's on her days off and wants to relax she can't because of my brother but the disturbed sleep is the worst part. \n\nLast Sunday I told my brother he has to leave. We aren't heartless. I gave him May 31 as a deadline. That's one entire month of notice. I don't like asking him to leave but my wife's need to sleep is important. To say my brother is furious would be an understatement. He's says we're putting him on the street because he has nowhere to go (parents live in a retirement community, grandparents are all in assisted living. There's no other family he can stay with). He is trying to guilt my wife even though she feels terrible. She loves my brother but she needs to sleep. My brother is furious with me. Aita for evicting him?\n\n(Helping him financial is not feasible. Me and my wife are saving to buy a house. I got laid off early in the pandemic so we had to dip into our savings. We can't afford to give my brother any money.
