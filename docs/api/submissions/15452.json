BUT the problem is that it affects you! It messes with your right to live in the moment. How she experiences everyday life shouldn't interfere with yours. That's what you should have said not try to make it seem like an unsolicited advice. \n Nta", "NTA I hate people that have to look at life through a filtered lens, ad-nauseum. You're absolutely correct, she's using this as a way to be disengaged while still being able to maintain a claim of participation. What is she worried is gonna happen if she puts the camera down? That she might have to actually interact? She sounds really sad...", "NTA.\n\n>She didn't say much but walked away but must've told my wife because my wife came up to me asking me what I said to her sister. I told her and my wife told me that I had no right to say that and I should apologize. \n\nDidn't she record her conversations with either you or your wife? If not, they can't have been important.", "I agree with you that her behavior was obnoxious. That must have been annoying, especially asking you guys to restart your dance. With that being said though, telling her \"it must suck to think that way\" is probably about the least tactful way you could have tried to change her perspective or build a relationship with someone who's a major part of your wife's life. It's very different to give feedback on a specific behavior (\"this thing bothered me because...\") versus making a sweeping judgment on someone's entire life (\"you don't know how to live\").\n\nGonna go with ESH because of the way you raised the issue specifically, but I also can acknowledge that your frustration was probably justified as well.", "NTA, I disagree with it being none of your business because likely all the videos include you and who knows where she\u2019s sharing them to. That would feel like a huge invasion of privacy to me.", "NTA, I understand, but also you made a comment about her when there is a perfectly valid reason while still staying on your side of the street: you don\u2019t feel comfortable with constantly being recorded whether it\u2019s background audio or video.", "ESH you should have just drawn a boundary, like when the sister asked you to re-start the dance - no would have been a fine answer. That's only going to work if wife agrees with you, though. If not, then you've got a conversation to have with her about how to work this out going forward.", "Nta\u2026they\u2019re some people who are too busy curating this perfect image for social negus that they forget how to enjoy the moments of life.  Because she was filming you, it is your business.  I\u2019d be annoyed to redo the dance too just because she didn\u2019t record it.", "Nta. I don't spend time around people like that too much as I don't want my face all over social media. You are in the videos, that makes it your business and you have every right to request that she doesn't include you in them. \n\nI also agree that she's missing out on living in the moment. While it's nice to have visual memories to look back on, I prefer the feeling of enjoying my surroundings instead of fumbling around with my phone to get a blurry recording that doesn't even come close to capturing what I felt at the time.", "NAH.  You are just Really different.  Good thing you married to each other.", "Ok how about telling her she don\u2019t have your permission to record you or anything your are doing.  Tell her that you aren\u2019t comfortable being recording 24/7.  If your wife and her family are comfortable so be it but you aren\u2019t.", "NTA  Imagine if she recorded the day of drinking and something bad happened. Is SIL in any of these recordings?", ">\tWe talked for a bit, then I told her to enjoy herself, that she doesn\u2019t have to record every little thing. She says she does and it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nYTA. Apart from the slight rudeness of her making people wait or restart, she\u2019s absolutely right. She can record every moment of her life it has NOTHING to do with you. \n\nShe would be an asshole for telling you that you don\u2019t record enough.", "YTA. You can draw boundaries about being in her photos and videos all you like, but there\u2019s no need to insult her personally. You\u2019re going to get N T A votes because people have a knee jerk reaction of \u2018oh I don\u2019t like those people either\u2019\u2026but not liking how someone lives their life doesn\u2019t actually give you a right to be rude and insulting to them.\n\nAlso, it was your wife\u2019s birthday. You messed it up by starting pointless drama with her sister. Apologize to both of them.", "NTA\n\nHow rude to make you start the dance again because she was busy.\n\nShe needs to snap out of it, turn her phone off and touch grass", "YTA. What are you, her mom? Yeah it\u2019s annoying she wanted you to restart the dance but not enough to warrant you criticizing her lifestyle. Who cares what other people do? You seem to be the only one very bothered by it. \n\nApologize. That was pretty uncalled for.", "I think YTA. However not a hard YTA as you seemed to let your frustration dictate your actions and not really think it through.\n\nI think boundaries need to be made here if you don't want to be in her videos. It's perfectly valid to not want to be recorded and she needs to respect that. It's okay not to enjoy it either. Perfectly valid. It doesn't sound like you've gone through them with the SIL but only the wife. Your SIL deserves the chance to show she can respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, recording and making little videos might be her hobby. You might not see the purpose of it but it's not for you. You don't need to understand as it's not about you. It's for her. The SIL absolutely should have taken what you said to heart because you were judging her and demeaning something she enjoys. You weren't saying what you did out of concern for her. You weren't saying it out of love or care. You went to dismiss her little bit of the world you didn't like. \n\nIf recording things gives her joy in life, who are you to stamp on it when life is already so tough? You should be encouraging her to grab that bit of happiness with both hands. \n\nThe minimum you should do is apologise. The next step would be to discuss boundaries if being in the video is not what you want. You have the right to not be recorded. You don't have the right to dictate what brings her joy.", "YTA.\n\n'She says she does and it's none of my business.'\n\nThat's where you leave it or set a boundary (i.e. 'cool but please don't record me in future, I don't like it').\n\n'I told her she was right but told her it must suck to think that way and told her she doesn't know how to live in the moment, imagine trying to choreograph everything.'\n\nThat's condescending. I don't necessarily disagree with you, but there was no need to criticise how she chooses to live her life.", "NTA, from now on just pull silly faces everytime she films you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
