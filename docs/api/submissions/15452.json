That's what you should have said not try to make it seem like an unsolicited advice. \n Nta", "NTA I hate people that have to look at life through a filtered lens, ad-nauseum. You're absolutely correct, she's using this as a way to be disengaged while still being able to maintain a claim of participation. What is she worried is gonna happen if she puts the camera down?

If not, they can't have been important.", "I agree with you that her behavior was obnoxious. That must have been annoying, especially asking you guys to restart your dance. With that being said though, telling her \"it must suck to think that way\" is probably about the least tactful way you could have tried to change her perspective or build a relationship with someone who's a major part of your wife's life. It's very different to give feedback on a specific behavior (\"this thing bothered me because...\") versus making a sweeping judgment on someone's entire life (\"you don't know how to live\").\n\nGonna go with ESH because of the way you raised the issue specifically, but I also can acknowledge that your frustration was probably justified as well.", "NTA, I disagree with it being none of your business because likely all the videos include you and who knows where she\u2019s sharing them to. That would feel like a huge invasion of privacy to me.", "NTA, I understand, but also you made a comment about her when there is a perfectly valid reason while still staying on your side of the street: you don\u2019t feel comfortable with constantly being recorded whether it\u2019s background audio or video.", "ESH you should have just drawn a boundary, like when the sister asked you to re-start the dance - no would have been a fine answer. That's only going to work if wife agrees with you, though. If not, then you've got a conversation to have with her about how to work this out going forward.", "Nta\u2026they\u2019re some people who are too busy curating this perfect image for social negus that they forget how to enjoy the moments of life.  Because she was filming you, it is your business.  I\u2019d be annoyed to redo the dance too just because she didn\u2019t record it.", "Nta. I don't spend time around people like that too much as I don't want my face all over social media. You are in the videos, that makes it your business and you have every right to request that she doesn't include you in them. \n\nI also agree that she's missing out on living in the moment. While it's nice to have visual memories to look back on, I prefer the feeling of enjoying my surroundings instead of fumbling around with my phone to get a blurry recording that doesn't even come close to capturing what I felt at the time.", "NAH.  You are just Really different.  Good thing you married to each other.", "Ok how about telling her she don\u2019t have your permission to record you or anything your are doing.  Tell her that you aren\u2019t comfortable being recording 24/7.  If your wife and her family are comfortable so be it but you aren\u2019t.", "NTA  Imagine if she recorded the day of drinking and something bad happened. Is SIL in any of these recordings?", ">\tWe talked for a bit, then I told her to enjoy herself, that she doesn\u2019t have to record every little thing. She says she does and it\u2019s none of my business.\n\nYTA. Apart from the slight rudeness of her making people wait or restart, she\u2019s absolutely right. She can record every moment of her life it has NOTHING to do with you. \n\nShe would be an asshole for telling you that you don\u2019t record enough.", "YTA. You can draw boundaries about being in her photos and videos all you like, but there\u2019s no need to insult her personally. You\u2019re going to get N T A votes because people have a knee jerk reaction of \u2018oh I don\u2019t like those people either\u2019\u2026but not liking how someone lives their life doesn\u2019t actually give you a right to be rude and insulting to them.\n\nAlso, it was your wife\u2019s birthday. You messed it up by starting pointless drama with her sister. Apologize to both of them.", "NTA\n\nHow rude to make you start the dance again because she was busy.\n\nShe needs to snap out of it, turn her phone off and touch grass", "YTA. What are you, her mom? Yeah it\u2019s annoying she wanted you to restart the dance but not enough to warrant you criticizing her lifestyle. Who cares what other people do? You seem to be the only one very bothered by it. \n\nApologize. That was pretty uncalled for.", "I think YTA. However not a hard YTA as you seemed to let your frustration dictate your actions and not really think it through.\n\nI think boundaries need to be made here if you don't want to be in her videos. It's perfectly valid to not want to be recorded and she needs to respect that. It's okay not to enjoy it either. Perfectly valid. It doesn't sound like you've gone through them with the SIL but only the wife. Your SIL deserves the chance to show she can respect your boundaries. \n\nHowever, recording and making little videos might be her hobby. You might not see the purpose of it but it's not for you. You don't need to understand as it's not about you. It's for her. The SIL absolutely should have taken what you said to heart because you were judging her and demeaning something she enjoys. You weren't saying what you did out of concern for her. You weren't saying it out of love or care. You went to dismiss her little bit of the world you didn't like. \n\nIf recording things gives her joy in life, who are you to stamp on it when life is already so tough? You should be encouraging her to grab that bit of happiness with both hands. \n\nThe minimum you should do is apologise. The next step would be to discuss boundaries if being in the video is not what you want. You have the right to not be recorded. You don't have the right to dictate what brings her joy.", "YTA.\n\n'She says she does and it's none of my business.'\n\nThat's where you leave it or set a boundary (i.e. 'cool but please don't record me in future, I don't like it').\n\n'I told her she was right but told her it must suck to think that way and told her she doesn't know how to live in the moment, imagine trying to choreograph everything.'\n\nThat's condescending.

I understand people have the right to record in public places, but I could rant forever about this.\n\nEdit: worked at the same place for 8 years, but always asked to be not included for any pics they post. My job respected that because I told them the last job I had, the guy found out I was there and started showing up, incessantly calling the manager to ask to talk to me. Of course, I got in trouble cause my manager was a shit.

YTA. Why take an opportunity to enjoy being in the moment with her to tell her how to live her life. I feel like this is like going up to someone and saying hey you should be happier. You should really try to be happier. This is how she enjoys the moment. Why is it such a big deal to you? That's what you should have articulated if it really is a big deal.\n\nWhat you could have done was say, hey I don't like being recorded or hey, I have a bone to pick with you about restarting the song. That could have led to a productive conversation and boundaries could have been established. You did not frame this about what your problem is but made her the problem. Framing something as you should enjoy the moment is telling her she's not enjoying the moment which you have no way of knowing. It's condescending from the start. \n\nAnd it's fine to have a problem with it, I would find it so annoying. But people are annoying. You are probably annoying. I'm definitely annoying.

When she says start over I need to record, tell her no, and to not interrupt the moment. Tell her everytime to stop interrupting your moments. She can start recording, but she'll get the message not to interrupt and try to \"redo\" natural moments", "NTA. It becomes your business when her obsession with recording every single thing means you have to wait for her to finish filming something before you can enjoy it or you have to start again because she wasn't filming. \n\nYou may benefit from setting some boundaries rather than accommodating her obsession. Obviously you can't force her to stop filming everything but say your meal gets delivered to the table while she's filming it, feel free to start eating it whenever you want because it's your meal and you are allowed to enjoy it in your own time, not hers.  If she missed the first few seconds of an important event, just continue on instead of restarting it.", "NTA. Tell her\u2014 that\u2019s a shame SIL is not in every record.

Maybe you could record another take of it?", "NTA. I knew someone who took pics or recorded everything, from concerts to games to you name it.

You cannot treat other people around you like they are paid actors, part of your live performance. It\u2019s an invasion of your privacy.\n\nIf it was only her food, her moves, her entrances that were part of her show.. who cares.. although it is annoying and I would avoid socializing with her. No harm to tell someone in a friendly manner that perhaps it\u2019s better to enjoy the moment than hoard footage that no one will care about. Especially if it\u2019s not even natural and rehearsed.", "I've done it as well. The surprisingly little known EXIF data fact has had the best track record. Every picture taken naturally has EXIF data on it. EXIF data includes a lot of information. Most importantly, it includes the time, camera information, and coordinates of a photo that was taken. \n\nThe whole I don't know how they found me stories can come from one photo.

Some people live in the moment differently then you and saying your SIL doesn\u2019t know how to live in the moment because she films everything is a dick move. \n\nYou should heed your own advice and live in the moment instead of worrying so much about what your SIL is doing. \n\nAlso, Im curious what the ages are here because if your SIL is Gen Z and you\u2019re say an elder millennial or older, your connection to your phone/filming things/tiktok/whatever may be vastly different.  \n\nI agree that you are welcome to tell her that you\u2019re not comfortable being recorded. You could have also spoken up about not wanting the song to be started Over to be recorded and ruining ~your~ moment with your wife. But like others are saying, people like this are everywhere and you have to get over it. \n\nIt\u2019s about how your communicate these things with people.

If she\u2019s having fun recording, why do you care?", "YTA.  There are better ways to bring stuff like that up, maybe ask her why she records everything?  My mom records nearly everything because she's getting older and her memory is beginning to lapse.  She wants for when her nest becomes empty for her to be able to look back through the years and relive all of these moments.", "NAH.", "So she is filming YOU and you have no right to tell her to quit it? Mmmm...NTA", "YTA.  Leave her alone.  She's volunteering to be the worker bee, why begrudge her?", "NTA. I get this. \n\nI remember doing a lot of things when I was younger and the internet wasn\u2019t as popular with influencer things. Like going to concerts in high school. no one really recorded on their phones (mainly quality issues) but everyone went to enjoy the show. \n\nI went to a concert a few years ago and everyone in front of me was watching the concert through the snapchat camera while they recorded it.", "op is nta but as for the sister it might be compulsive, like she might feel anxious if she doesn\u2019t record things. It\u2019s not a good way to live and she needs therapy for sure, but I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s hiding behind the lens idk", "Without knowing her there\u2019s no way to be sure. Sometimes folks with social anxiety will rely on having a clearly-defined role (eg, recording everything) in social situations as a way to avoid the uncertainty of more spontaneous participation. People with emotion regulation difficulties sometimes use distancing mechanisms like socializing online, rather than in person, or being the photographer rather than a participant, to make events feel less \u201creal\u201d and thus less overwhelming emotionally. And as you note, she may fell a compulsion to record for fear of missing something she\u2019ll want to review later, hoarding videos rather than possessions. \n\nOr, she could be a psychologically-sound person who just really enjoys taking videos and doesn\u2019t realize how disruptive and uncomfortable it is for others \u2014 especially as the rest of the family doesn\u2019t seem to find it annoying at all. Sometimes people are just really passionate about something and don\u2019t realize that the way they\u2019re engaging with their passion (doing what she does, or talking about their passion topic much, etc) is annoying others \u2014 especially if there\u2019s a community where they\u2019re getting positive feedback (likes, etc) for the same behaviors. \n\nI agree that she\u2019d probably benefit from therapy (but I mean, most people would; it\u2019s not like having a structured support system will hurt you if you\u2019re not mentally ill), and I also agree that we can\u2019t assume she\u2019s hiding behind the lens. There are just too many possible explanations.", "YTA- she is enjoying herself by recording everything. If that\u2019s how she enjoys herself let her have her fun as long as it\u2019s not hurting anyone. Also considering it was your wife\u2019s sister and not yours you should\u2019ve speaker to your wife before making what could be taken as a rude comment like that. If you didn\u2019t want to do the dance again then be an adult and say so instead of going over and making your wife\u2019s sister feel uncomfortable when you can talk to her alone.\n\nI understand it\u2019s annoying when people are on their phone all the time or recording everything but being a condescending prick doesn\u2019t make you any better. \u201cIt must really suck to live like that, you should live like me, the guy who gets mad at other people for enjoying themselves\u201d", "Was tempted to go with N T A at first, until I  reread how you actually handled this conversation.\n\nIn what universe is saying \u201cit must suck to think like you\u201d ever going to be helpful? You could have offered some useful perspective or just said but you were so antagonistic about it you guaranteed the message wouldn\u2019t get through and just started drama.

You have every right to demand not being recorded. 100% I would refuse to play into her video feeds. However, if she\u2019s happy doing it, then it\u2019s an asshole move to put her down in an effort to get her to stop recording you. You don\u2019t have to like it or her, but you don\u2019t try to convince someone that they\u2019ve got a problem when, in fact, it\u2019s your problem and you haven\u2019t asked her to stop including you in on it.

That\u2019s a you problem.\n\nIt sounds like you probably didn\u2019t tackle it that way because from how everyone else in the story seems to react, you will be causing ruffled feathers and you don\u2019t want to deal with it, so you addressed it by trying to make it seem like her \u201chobby\u201d was detrimental for her in an effort to get *her* to change, *which is not your call to make.* It can 100% be detrimental for *you*, so set boundaries with her in regards to it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t, in fact, have to deal with it. But I think you\u2019re avoiding the consequences of actually setting and requesting boundaries.", "NTA. I can kind of relate to the SIL. I took photos not recordings. It's mostly candid pics of family and friends. Some would say no but then come up later and ask for copies of pics or send them copies and it's usually the ones who didn't want pics. \n\nYou are right in that you don't live in the moment, I see things in through the lens. So, I have stopped taking photos and basically just use the phone fur pics. \n\nIt's liberating not taking pics of people. \n\nYour SIL probably feels that she is the recorder of family events or family everything and has taken on the self appointed role seriously. You said what needed to be said because it is frustrating. \n\nI guess you could apologize for unintentionally hurting her for the things you said and how you said it.", "NTA.omg is she an influencer ?", "Wait...did someone get upset because you voiced an *opinion*?\n\nOk then....\n\nNTA", "NTA. She would drive me absolutely bonkers! Thank god she doesn't follow ppl into the bluddy bathroom with her camera!", "YTA. You are in the right but this wasn't up to you to tell her.", "People have the right to not be filmed - at least morally, and in the civilized world even legally.", "NTA Massively annoying behaviour from SIL. If she wants to live her life hidden behind her phone that\u2019s up to her. I agree, it is sad to never participate and just record events, but that\u2019s her choice. Her choice stops when she starts directing people to perform for her. You\u2019re not an extra in her movie and she can really fuck off with that bullshit. Imagine the entitlement to interrupt a couple\u2019s genuine, spontaneous, intimate moment and ask them to perform it again so you can record them faking it.", "ESH. Telling her not to record you amd refusing to restart the dance - absolutely yes. Giving unsolicited advice on her life - no and who asked you\n\nIf it annoys you then don't go out with her and refuse to be in any videos. But her life (even if it's sad and disengaged which I agree it is) is none of your business. I'd say leave her alone but I'm pretty sure she'll avoid you outside of anywhere you both HAVE to be in the same place.", "ESH it's her life she can do wshe wants but it shouldn't impact upon you. You're well within your rights to say don't record me and no I'm not restarting the dance, now it's forced.  She should be able to appreciate not everyone wants to post everything about their lives.", "NTA I undertand taking pictures and recording videos so that you can remember special moments in a few years, but she's taking it to the extreme."]}
