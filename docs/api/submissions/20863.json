My ligament keeps retearing, resulting in more needed surgery, and I was told by the doctors that this was going to be my reality for the rest of my life. Before the accident, I loved to hike, but since the accident, I haven't been able to. \nI can't walk more than 20 ft without needing to sit down, I can't function without a mobility aid, and I can't stand for more than 10 minutes without a pain flareup. \nI want to see if I can find a doctor that will amputate my leg after all these years, because I know it will NEVER be the same, and I also know that if I were to get a prosthetic, I could go back to doing the physical activities I used to like to do prior to my accident, with the proper amount of PT. \nUnfortunately anytime I bring this up to my mother, it results in her being upset because I guess in her mind me having my leg amputated is too extreme and she doesn't believe that this accident should \"shape\" me in such an extreme way like resulting in a loss of limb. \nI want to try and improve my life, but I'm seeing how much me keeping my leg seems to matter to my mom, I'm second guessing if I should go about finding a doctor willing to help me. \nI'm grateful my mom did what she thought was best, I just don't think it actually was what was best. I've spoken to a few different ppl about this, some side with my mom, some side with me.

Your mother may very well be horrified but that doesn't justify her forcing you to go through all that pain when you could amputate it and maybe get a prosthetic even, and go out and do the things you'd like to do without being oppressed by physical suffering. I've seen people who've amputated their legs and still do crazy ass things like flipping a skateboard off of a ledge near some old highschool or smth. If you really really feel and know that your life would be better than how it is now, you should go with what you want. After all, it's not like you're forcing your mother to amputate her leg is it?

If she did, you want to get that sorted so that right is firmly yours, again.  And you want to get the legal and medical situation sorted so that you have someone who is not your mother as your medical proxy going forward, someone who shares your values and goals for your medical care and quality of life.  You may also want to see if there are legal steps you need to take, in order to ensure your mother doesn't act to regain control of your decisions should you become medically incapacitated again, trying to claim that right as your next-of-kin.\n\nYour mother seems to value aesthetic appearances over comfort and independence. \n\nA new second opinion, from an orthopedist who will bring fresh eyes to your case, is definitely a good idea. \n\nHow much an amputation will change your quality of life is a situation that has a lot of variables, including how high the damage goes, how well your body heals from surgery, what new damage has been done (if any) in the process of trying to repair your leg and get you to walk \"normally\" without a mobility aide.\n\nDon't forget to ask long-term questions, you may gain abilities at first, but may also lose them over time, and you can also do damage to your body with different mobility devices.  Constant sitting in a wheelchair can contribute to pressure sores, your hands, arms and wrists are not evolved to do the work of helping your legs by using crutches, and can suffer breakdown over time.  Compare pros and cons not just for your life now, but with how your body will adapt and react and change over 5, 10, 20, or 50 years.  You've got a lifetime to plan for.\n\nAn amputation won't magically make your problems go away.  You're trading one set of problems for another, different, set of problems.  Only you can decide which set of problems is more manageable. An amputation won't restore your health and mobility back to 100% of what it was when you were 18, before the accident and years of attempts to \"save\" your leg. You'll still have a lifetime of medical care for you leg, replacing prosthetics as needed, monitoring for chafing and skin breakdown, perhaps sometimes using a wheelchair if you have problems with skin and tissue damage where the cuff joins your leg and the prosthetic. \n\nYou are not AH for wanting an amputation in the hopes that it will improve your quality of life.  You are not AH to be wanting to make your medical decisions independently of your mother. You're not AH for saying \"this course of treatment isn't working well for me, let's look at other options.\"", "NTA. Your mom did what she thought was best years ago.

I had a boyfriend many years ago with a similar situation and it was clear that an immediate amputation would have saved him many surgeries and pain and his leg was still not very useable.  Unfortunately for him we're in the US and insurance would not pay for an \"unnecessary\" amputation or the prosthetic needed after.  When I was with him his knee was completely fused and because of the state of the rest of his leg an artificial knee was not an option.  So his leg did not bend.  His ankle was also messed up and had very limited range of motion and was painful.  It really limited him physically.\n\nYou are old enough to make your own decision and if you do it and it works out well your mom will see that you're more mobile and it was the right thing to do.

I think she's being selfish by holding you back.", "NTA. It's your leg and your choice. You're an adult afflicted by tragedy. You've had time to process it and live the reality of it for a decade.

Your quality of life sounds like it's in poor shape and this whole post reads as you being miserable as you are and struggling not to disappoint your mother.\n\nYou are allowed to make your own choices. I'm sure your mother loves you and thought she was advocating for your best shot at recovery. But it doesn't seem to be right for you and that's okay.  It's okay for you to make this choice for yourself. It's been almost 10 years, are you willing to make this suffering permanent for decades just to appease your mother?\n\nAt the very least you need to see other doctors for additional opinions on treatment.

It's been 9 years.

She\u2019s going to have feelings about it, but leg or no leg the accident did and does shape your life. \n\nI think you absolutely talk with doctors. Get a few opinions on what your options are. You should also see what your insurance would cover and look into the cost of prosthetics. They can be very expensive, especially if you want to do activities like hiking and running. \n\nThere\u2019s a surprising number of amputees on TikTok (and other SM, I\u2019m sure.) They talk about what it\u2019s like to live with a prosthetic and cover the pros and cons of different types. \n\nAnother consideration is the comments you will get from strangers. It sounds like you currently have an invisible disability. Are you going to be ok with it being more visible and having to deal with the social part of it? \n\nI would also ask how much an amputation will affect your pain. Hopefully it will be significantly less, but it might not be completely gone. Sometimes there\u2019s pain from the prosthetic. But for a lot of people, there is improvement and greater mobility. There\u2019s certainly no harm in getting a few opinions from doctors.", "Your mom fought for your leg 9 years ago and that\u2019s a wonderful thing she did for you. But if 9 years later you feel having your leg is actually giving you less quality of life, then you should do what makes you happy.

Yes, doesn't sound so great for you now but the grass may not be greener. Maybe amputation is the right path but be 100 % sure as there's no going back.", "YTA, BUT Oh man you need to cut the cord.

Some gifts just suck and need to be discarded.", "NTA. She was working with fear, uncertainty, and speculation. I'm sure it was a scary time to have to make big decisions. I'm sure she told herself, the doctors, and your dad that no one can predict how preserving your leg would turn out, that God would protect you, and that you'd never forgive her for taking  your leg unnecessarily. Look at it this way: she gave you the opportunity to keep the leg _if you want to_. I'm not convinced that was a good decision, but I get why someone would make it. But now you are not working with fear, uncertainty, or speculation. The doctors' predictions turned out to be correct, God hasn't given you a healthy pain-free leg, and you aren't mad at the prospect of amputation.
