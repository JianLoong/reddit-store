{"id": 2036, "submission_id": "ys9ijv", "title": "AITA for telling my child she doesn\u2019t have to hug anyone, including her dad?", "selftext": "This has been an ongoing battle for the last couple years, so just looking for some input. \n\nMy (37F) family consists of my husband, we\u2019ll call him H for simplicity, (35M), and our 3 kids J (11F), O (7M), and L (1M). H is the father of all 3. O is autistic and H, while never formally tested, also has autistic tendencies. They both LOVE hugs/cuddles/physical affection and get along great. \n\nJ and myself prefer not to be hugged/touched unless we are in the mood for it or request it. Now, as a married adult I try to give H more physical affection than I want because it is his love language and I try to show him love in his terms sometimes (according to him, it is still not often enough). But J is a tween girl. She dislikes us half the time just for existing. Sometimes she will give me hugs, but I make sure they are on her terms and don\u2019t demand them. \n\nH, on the other hand, will ask her for a hug (because I told him he had to ask after previous arguments between them from him forcing them on her), and then get super pissed at her if she says no. When I tell him that it is her right to do so, he then yells at me. \n\nFor example, before school this morning, J was moody (this is typical, she is NOT a morning person). He told her Good Morning and she sorta grunted in response. Then he asked her for a hug and she shook her head no and came downstairs for breakfast. After, she needed to run back upstairs to use the restroom before we left. She voiced concern that her dad was upstairs and seemed mad at her for saying no before. I reminded her that she does not have to hug anyone if she doesn\u2019t want, and that I\u2019d remind him if it came up. Of course, he asked her again for a hug when she came out of the bathroom. She declined, he started fussing at her about disrespect and she came back downstairs to me. \n\nHe started yelling down the stairs about how she was disrespecting him and that was no excuse for a child to not hug her own dad. I told him that he asked and she is allowed to say \u201cno\u201d. She doesn\u2019t like unwanted hugs and didn\u2019t want one. When the kids headed out to school I asked them to yell \u201cbye\u201d up to their dad who was still getting dressed. O immediately did, J quietly said she was feeling too angry at him for yelling at her. He yelled back down \u201cI love you O\u201d, but said nothing to her (so mature, I know). \nThen H came down and bitched at me for always taking J\u2019s side with the affection issue. He says I am going to turn her into a disrespectful brat who doesn\u2019t listen to her parents and says he \u201cisn\u2019t having that in his house\u201d. I responded calmly, but did not change my views. He left for work mad at me too.\n\nH has always gotten along better with O than with J. But to literally tell one child he loves them and ignore the other really upsets me\u2026 \n\nAnyway, AITA for taking my daughter\u2019s side and telling her she doesn\u2019t HAVE to hug anyone, even her dad?\n\nEdit: We all talked very honestly this afternoon and he claims he will make changes. He says he understands the reasoning and her thoughts about it. I truly hope things change. Also, I\u2019ll link my fabulous text shredding of him in case y\u2019all ever need me to yell at someone for you.\n[Texts](https://at.tumblr.com/thingsithinkbutdonotsay/700679297063665664/rtqjaj5t53sk)", "created_utc": 1668170910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys9ijv/aita_for_telling_my_child_she_doesnt_have_to_hug/", "score": 3239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you force her to give or accept any kind of affection you\u2019re setting her up to be abused by a partner because she will already have the idea that she can\u2019t say no.

I one time forced that issue until I read one of these stories about a woman not making her 2 year old to give grandma a hug. It hit me that all kids should have that right and started giving my granddaughter a kiss on the cheek or forehead or top of her head. She loves hugs and kisses but never on the lips.

When her first date tries to feel her up and she says no, should she meekly give it up when he gets pouty and pissy? Your husband is prioritizing his short term need for superficial affection over the very real long term needs of your daughter. He is an asshole. And not saying he loves her? Also incredibly emotionally manipulative. I guess he also wants her to learn that when she declines sex on some future occasion it\u2019s totally normal and acceptable for her would-be partner to ignore her and not love her anymore because her only purpose in life is to make whatever man is nearby temporarily and superficially happy. \n\nThis post made me so angry. Your husband is a giant fucking asshole.", "NTA", "NTA, I am 100% with you on the hugging thing.\n\nHowever, if this is a regular conflict, you need to find solutions to it. You say your husband said good morning, and your daughter grunted. She needs to be taught that there are expectations: she needs to answer something civil when greeted. I bet if she had said \u201cgood morning dad\u201d, he might not have felt the need to escalate this. It is important to learn that whether she is grumpy in the morning or not, being civil is a basic expectation.\n\nYour husband feels disrespected and is trying to assert control by forcing hugs. The way he is going about it is terrible and he 100% needs to stop. But you could also try to teach both of them to redirect; if she doesn\u2019t want to hug, can she offer him a hi-5 instead? Find a special nickname for him she only uses affectionately? Do a fist bump? Would a kiss on the forehead be ok with her? Could he kiss her hand? Sitting down with both of them and talking it out might be a good idea.\n\nYour husband is going about this 100% the wrong way. What he wants is to communicate affection to his child, and what he is doing is making her fearful of physical contact and teaching her there are expectations on her physical availability.

Just something to consider.\" Instead of encouraging her to tell him no.  You could also talk to your husband in a kinder way about it since you know physical affection is his love language.  He probably WANTS to hug all of his children. I can't imagine denying my dad a hug whether he wanted one or not.  I think it's concerning that your daughter is opposed to hugging her dad.

If touch is truly something for J then I have seen some families have a special love board where they draw a heart when they want to show affection.

I had heard this man felt his children couldn't say no to him when it came to hugs, but that was the first time I saw it in person. I went to my car and cried afterward. The next day, I went back to that house and told the mom that what he was doing was sick, that it was essentially teaching her she couldn't tell men no, and that they could do what they wanted with her. The mom cried because she'd asked her husband to stop several times, and he said it was her own issues, and that what he was doing was normal. I made it very clear it wasn't. After that, she basically freaked out on her husband and said that he was never to touch their daughter again unless she said it was okay.

Give her some time and she may end up growing out of the angst/hate my parents phase.\n\nOverall, if it makes her uncomfortable, then your husband should respect that. He is allowed to feel upset, but don\u2019t take it out on the daughter. Don\u2019t yell at her for saying no to someone touching her.

Your husband doesn't understand that just because he made these people, he doesn't own them. No one should ever, EVER be pressured into unwanted physical touch with another human being. Or does he think any man can demand to touch her, if they want it bad enough, and feel entitled to her? When does her body belong to her?\n\nThe fact that he gives her this kind of power over his moods aside, that he still even **asks her for hugs** is a problem. He is the disrespectful one, he is the one who is being a brat. And he is the one who will have a distant relationship with his daughter, going forward. He needs to learn the concept of bodily autonomy, and find another way of feeling connected to her, that is acceptable to her and doesn't make him act like a giant AH.

She should also not be running to one parent when the other is disagreeing with her.  I say this as an autistic person who grew up with an autistic parent, autism is not an excuse for bad behavior. Your husband is also just as entitled to his feelings as she is. If he\u2019s upset his child doesn\u2019t want a hug then that is okay. \n\nThat being said he\u2019s being a baby.

I think maybe the way to discuss this with H is explaining consent. You want her to grow up knowing that she can tell someone no, even if they are someone of authority. That yes, it is hard as a parent not to receive affection, especially if it had been given previously. But his response and actions are teaching her that she cannot consent to the ownership of her body. Certainly, any logical father (I know this is a big statement) should agree that he doesn\u2019t want to teach his daughter that she can\u2019t say no when someone is trying to push themselves on her.", "This.

Hopping on top comment to say that \u201cobligated physical affection\u201d is old-school etiquette that needs to be wiped out. I see it a lot in older generations and with some men. OP, you have the right mentality. Your husband may need therapy to recondition what he\u2019s been societally conditioned and possibly trained by his upbringing to believe. Try approaching it with him from a perspective of there are many different ways to show affection and love, and it\u2019s not love if it\u2019s forced. J can show affection with a high five, a wave, a smile, or even kind words. If your husband still struggles, try explaining it this way: if someone\u2019s love language is gifts, is it ok for them to demand gifts from someone they love and be offended if they don\u2019t get the amount or expense of gift they want? A hug for your daughter might be like the Lexus of gifts. Rare, not something she feels comfortable giving often, and in no way truly indicative of her love. You can\u2019t force a person to give an expression of love you want, and honestly, it\u2019s concerning that someone would want to. If a person doesn\u2019t want to hug me or show me love, forcing it doesn\u2019t mean they love me. It just means I strong-armed them into compliance. That sort of power-struggle is unhealthy, and it\u2019s not disrespectful for your daughter to want boundaries.

I remember her getting angry one day when I was in HS and we just got back from grocery shopping, we got this foot long sub sandwich to split like we usually did. She wanted to eat it right away and I was like ok cool I'll eat my half later since I'm not hungry, and she just insisted that I should eat right now even tho I kept telling her I'm not hungry yet give me some time and I'll eat my half soon. She just started screaming at me \"EAT IT!! What are you anorexic or something???\" I don't even remember how that argument ended, I just remember how angry she got. When she'd get real heated she'd literally get foamy drool on the corners of her mouth like a rabid animal, and this was one of the times it happened. It was so gross and unnerving I hated it when she got like that, and it just got worse as I got older until I finally snapped and said I'm done I'm not letting you into my life anymore.", "This is disgusting.

It opens them up to being more vulnerable in a situation where the stakes are higher and doesn't teach them to protect themselves. \nYou are doing the right thing\nYour husband is being extremely entitled over your tween daughters body. Even if all he wants is a hug he is setting a dangerous precedent that she should subject herself to discomfort to receive love and affection. Your husband needs to stop.

The fact that he is trying to demand physical touch from your child to satisfy his own wishes, and then seriously lashing out at both you and your young child is completely out of bounds. He needs to get a fucking grip.\n\nIt also sounds like you're going to need to sit all of your kids down and make it clear that their father's behaving completely inappropriately. He is modeling bad behavior for all of the children and they all need to know that he's being an asshole", "NTA\n\nForcing a child into physical affection when they're uncomfortable with it is one of the best ways to groom them for sexual assault. You're showing a kid that adults can make demands for their body, that affection can be forced and uncomfortable, and they don't have the right to say no to adults touching them without aggressive or even violent consequences.", "NTA she needs to be taught she has control over her own body! Also your husband needs to read UNTANGLED because otherwise he is going to destroy his relationship with the teenage girl she is about to become!", "NTA! It's actually very concerning that your husband didn't seem to be completely on board with teaching his daughter about bodily autonomy. She absolutely has the right to say no; it isn't disrespect on her part, it's disrespectful of *him* to expect physical affection when she may not be comfortable with it. And absolutely immature for him to withhold affection (in this case, saying \"I love you\" to his own child) as a punishment for her saying \"no.\"\n\nYour text shredding wouldn't load for me, but I hope it was really brutal. And if he doesn't change the way he deals with this issue in the future, I'd say you should insist on some family therapy.

All H is doing is teaching her that her wants do not matter and she should give him a hug because it makes HIM feel good.\n\nYou are an amazing mom for being an advocate for your daughter and staying consistent with it. NTA. Show him these responses. His behaviour regarding this is abusive.", "NTA. Google tea and consent. Make your husband and daughter watch it.", "NTA, you are actually doing a really GOOD thing by respecting her bodily autonomy and teaching her about boundaries like this at a young age. This old school forcing kids to hug people thing is traumatic and arguably abusive.", "NTA at alllllll. Thank the Lord for your daughter having you to support her boundaries!  Maybe they could implement a choice chart, they do this at my kids school. The teacher has a chart of high five, wave, or hug and the kids point to their choice and that\u2019s how they say good bye and good job for the day. With our autistic neighbor, we say hi and expect nothing in return , he now, after a few years, will run to my daughter and mom for a hug, ON HIS TERMS. Love can be in many different forms. A parent\u2019s job is to meet the child on those terms and love them UNCONDITIONALLY!!!", "NTA. You are teaching your daughter bodily autonomy, and that is a good thing. \n\nYour husband really needs to be told what kind of message he is sending to you both J and O (and L if he doesn't stop soon). A preteen girl certainly doesn't need to learn that her rejection of any kind of affection or physical intimacy from a male will result in being yelled at and shunned. And your sons sure don't need to learn to emulate your husband's behavior in this regard. Hubby needs to learn to respect his daughter if he wants her respect.", "Yes!! And how can he enjoy a hug from someone who doesn\u2019t want to give one? Is he so convinced that she\u2019ll change her mind mid-hug? What if she doesn\u2019t? How can he find enjoyment in a mutual activity when the other person so clearly doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s not okay!!", "This!! As a social worker who has been the therapist for the children who have been groomed by loved ones, not always purposely realizing that is what they are doing until their child comes home having been sexually harassed or assaulted. And all too many times where it was a parent who kept forcing the physical relationship to be there against the child\u2019s wishes. And more than that the children who do not have the sexual assault, but don\u2019t know how to have healthy relationships because they are taught not to stand their ground and advocate for their own wishes. OP not saying this is intentionally what your husband is doing because it sounds like he also has some skewed views, but I see in your future and highly recommend family therapy if your husband wants any kind of relationship with his daughter in the future. NTA", "Yeah, I think you should make this The last stand and if there is not immediate change of him going to get professional help to treat you and your kids right, it should be the end of the marriage.

He shouldn't be around your children or you at all anymore", "No offense\u2014but if you honestly feel this way\u2014why stay with him? Like why all this bluffing?\n\nMaybe you two are ultimately incompatible if the way the needs, wants and demands affection are adverse to your nature? Like this can\u2019t be healthy for you as much as it\u2019s unhealthy for your daughter. In your post you even say you give him more physical affection than you want too. And all I could think is\u2014why the hell kind of marriage is this?", "And the fear she's feeling is intentional. He's intentionally making it so uncomfortable to say no to manipulate her into relenting. He's grooming her to respond to coercion, and teaching her that saying no leads to punishment. This conditioning is why OP tries to appease him, and why he still complains to force total obedience instead of appreciating her effort to satisfy his \"love language\". I agree, this isn't really that. I don't think he's necessarily aware of what he's doing and why, but he's extremely entitled, lacks empathy, and seeks control/power. That's a huge red flag, for a parent and a spouse. He's conflating respect with blind obedience, but only when it comes to him because he sees his family as beneath him \"in his house\". \n\nHe's teaching her that people who \"love\" her will punish her for not capitulating, will steamroll her if she draws a line, and will be resentful & punish her if she doesn't sacrifice her needs for their wants. It's the reason why many boys see boundaries as a challenge to defeat, and why girls experience so much abuse, to the extent that *way* too many women experience sexual coercion even in their marriages. Some women have never had a sexual experience that *didn't* include coercion. It's treated as normal and \"just the way men are\". That's bullshit, but it's viewed that way for a reason. Her own father is saying \"retract your boundary or I will hurt you\". Hurting her may not involve physical abuse, but hurting her with shame, guilt, petty digs, pressure, manipulation, anger, fear, unfair treatment, and resentment isn't better. In many ways it's much, *much* worse.", "You\u2019re a good parent. Definitely keep on this. \u2764\ufe0f", "This! He\u2019s a creep!!! Does he demand hugs from the boys too or is it just you women?!", "Yo, like a truly sounds like this child is not safe", "He shouldn\u2019t be getting angry about it, but to insinuate that she\u2019s unsafe because her dad wants a hug and gets upset when she says no is a ridiculous thing to do.", "My mom used to tickle me. Turned out she loves being tickled. Found that out as an adult. I hated it. I asked her to stop & told her I didn't like it. The thing that finally made her stop? We were out to eat at a favorite restaurant when I was a tween & had just finished our meal. I'm seated on the inside/wall side of a booth. She commenced tickling me & I told her to stop as usual. She didn't as usual. But due to having just eaten... my stomach revolted & I threw up all over her b/c I couldn't escape. \n\n\nI'm glad she finally stopped, but it was embarrassing & kinda traumatic for that to have had to be the way she finally took me seriously. And to this day I have violent rage feelings if someone even accidentally tickles me. I can & do suppress them. But it's a legacy I don't want from something that I had no control over as a child. :/ Bodily autonomy isn't just for grown-ups.", "Whether she's immediately unsafe isn't the point, she's still in an insane situation because this teaches her unsafe behaviour down the line, it teaches her that she SHOULD crack and give anyone who gets angry at her for not wanting intimacy intimacy. That is an unsafe lesson that is being taught to her and he's also teaching her brothers that they DESERVE intimacy if they want it and they should get aggressive if people say no. So yes, whilst there may not be immediate danger she (along with others) is still unsafe due to the lessons her father is teaching her and her brothers.", "Holy shit that's awful, it shouldn't have gotten that far for her to get the hint. I've only been with my boyfriend for roughly 3 years and he hasn't tickled me in 2 years, and he loved tickling too. He loved the laughter it produced and was pretty sad when I told him I hate it, but he still stopped for me. Everyone deserves bodily autonomy and boundaries for themselves, it's personally enraging just thinking about parents who ignore their kids boundaries. Tickling wasn't the only thing my mom didn't care if I liked or not and I just feel for kids who are forced to kiss or hug a relative when they don't want to."]}
