{"id": 2036, "submission_id": "ys9ijv", "title": "AITA for telling my child she doesn\u2019t have to hug anyone, including her dad?", "selftext": "This has been an ongoing battle for the last couple years, so just looking for some input. \n\nMy (37F) family consists of my husband, we\u2019ll call him H for simplicity, (35M), and our 3 kids J (11F), O (7M), and L (1M). H is the father of all 3. O is autistic and H, while never formally tested, also has autistic tendencies. They both LOVE hugs/cuddles/physical affection and get along great. \n\nJ and myself prefer not to be hugged/touched unless we are in the mood for it or request it. Now, as a married adult I try to give H more physical affection than I want because it is his love language and I try to show him love in his terms sometimes (according to him, it is still not often enough). But J is a tween girl. She dislikes us half the time just for existing. Sometimes she will give me hugs, but I make sure they are on her terms and don\u2019t demand them. \n\nH, on the other hand, will ask her for a hug (because I told him he had to ask after previous arguments between them from him forcing them on her), and then get super pissed at her if she says no. When I tell him that it is her right to do so, he then yells at me. \n\nFor example, before school this morning, J was moody (this is typical, she is NOT a morning person). He told her Good Morning and she sorta grunted in response. Then he asked her for a hug and she shook her head no and came downstairs for breakfast. After, she needed to run back upstairs to use the restroom before we left. She voiced concern that her dad was upstairs and seemed mad at her for saying no before. I reminded her that she does not have to hug anyone if she doesn\u2019t want, and that I\u2019d remind him if it came up. Of course, he asked her again for a hug when she came out of the bathroom. She declined, he started fussing at her about disrespect and she came back downstairs to me. \n\nHe started yelling down the stairs about how she was disrespecting him and that was no excuse for a child to not hug her own dad. I told him that he asked and she is allowed to say \u201cno\u201d. She doesn\u2019t like unwanted hugs and didn\u2019t want one. When the kids headed out to school I asked them to yell \u201cbye\u201d up to their dad who was still getting dressed. O immediately did, J quietly said she was feeling too angry at him for yelling at her. He yelled back down \u201cI love you O\u201d, but said nothing to her (so mature, I know). \nThen H came down and bitched at me for always taking J\u2019s side with the affection issue. He says I am going to turn her into a disrespectful brat who doesn\u2019t listen to her parents and says he \u201cisn\u2019t having that in his house\u201d. I responded calmly, but did not change my views. He left for work mad at me too.\n\nH has always gotten along better with O than with J. But to literally tell one child he loves them and ignore the other really upsets me\u2026 \n\nAnyway, AITA for taking my daughter\u2019s side and telling her she doesn\u2019t HAVE to hug anyone, even her dad?", "created_utc": 1668170910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys9ijv/aita_for_telling_my_child_she_doesnt_have_to_hug/", "score": 524, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s no reason a child should be forced to accept affection or give affection she doesn\u2019t want. If you force her to give or accept any kind of affection you\u2019re setting her up to be abused by a partner because she will already have the idea that she can\u2019t say no. Absolutely allow her to choose her own time and kind of affection.  My granddaughter doesn\u2019t like kisses on the lips and hasn\u2019t since she was a little over a year old. I one time forced that issue until I read one of these stories about a woman not making her 2 year old to give grandma a hug. It hit me that all kids should have that right and started giving my granddaughter a kiss on the cheek or forehead or top of her head. She loves hugs and kisses but never on the lips.

When her first date tries to feel her up and she says no, should she meekly give it up when he gets pouty and pissy? Your husband is prioritizing his short term need for superficial affection over the very real long term needs of your daughter. He is an asshole. And not saying he loves her? Also incredibly emotionally manipulative. I guess he also wants her to learn that when she declines sex on some future occasion it\u2019s totally normal and acceptable for her would-be partner to ignore her and not love her anymore because her only purpose in life is to make whatever man is nearby temporarily and superficially happy. \n\nThis post made me so angry. Your husband is a giant fucking asshole.", "NTA", "NTA, I am 100% with you on the hugging thing.\n\nHowever, if this is a regular conflict, you need to find solutions to it. You say your husband said good morning, and your daughter grunted. She needs to be taught that there are expectations: she needs to answer something civil when greeted. I bet if she had said \u201cgood morning dad\u201d, he might not have felt the need to escalate this. It is important to learn that whether she is grumpy in the morning or not, being civil is a basic expectation.\n\nYour husband feels disrespected and is trying to assert control by forcing hugs. The way he is going about it is terrible and he 100% needs to stop. But you could also try to teach both of them to redirect; if she doesn\u2019t want to hug, can she offer him a hi-5 instead? Find a special nickname for him she only uses affectionately? Do a fist bump? Would a kiss on the forehead be ok with her? Could he kiss her hand? Sitting down with both of them and talking it out might be a good idea.\n\nYour husband is going about this 100% the wrong way. What he wants is to communicate affection to his child, and what he is doing is making her fearful of physical contact and teaching her there are expectations on her physical availability.

You can advocate for your daughter's needs without saying it the way you did.  You literally seem to be encouraging a distance between your husband and daughter.   I think you'd be better off saying something like: \"I understand your preference for less hugs but he's your dad and you might one day not regret giving him more hugs.  Just something to consider.\" Instead of encouraging her to tell him no.  You could also talk to your husband in a kinder way about it since you know physical affection is his love language.  He probably WANTS to hug all of his children. I can't imagine denying my dad a hug whether he wanted one or not.  I think it's concerning that your daughter is opposed to hugging her dad.  I think therapy might be needed to get to the bottom of this because it's IMO very normal to hug your dad.\n\nAnd your husband shouldn't withhold words of love just because daughter isn't in the mood for a hug today.

You say your son is like his father. Does he give unwanted hugs to sister too?\n\nTopping off all that with a 'I love you O!' is childish and petty. He's a grown man and father, not an 11 year old.

You want OP to tell a very impressionable young woman \"you need to swallow your feelings of discomfort with physical touch in order to make your father happy. \" That is the problem.\n\nA father is often seen as an authority figure. And often autistic people (myself as an example) group all authority figures together as a \"you have to listen and do as they say\" so this could easily lead her to struggling to say no to say a teacher because teacher=authority figure in a lot of our brains. So if she's not allowed to say no to her father she may grow as a person with the mindset of \"do not tell any authority figures no\"\n\nAnd physical touch can be physically painful to someone with sensory issues. She may not like hugs because of various reasons such as the fabric he's wearing irritates her senses, his soap, cologne anything can set off a sensory issue and hugs are very close proximity so she's being swamped by it all.\n\nShe's expressed discomfort with physical touch. And she's made it clear that showing physical attention is NOT how she likes to show love. So why is her language of love not important but her father's is? She can show love other ways. She's not denying him her love and affection. She's just not wanting to hug him. He on the other hand is implementing silent treatment and withdrew his love (by even refusing to say I love you) because he's mad she won't hug him\n\nTHAT is why he's an asshole.\n\nAnd you claim family should be above her discomfort. What about the creepy uncle or aunt that makes EVERYONE uncomfortable but is still invited to the family gatherings? Is she expected to hug and kiss him regardless of how he makes her feel? No she shouldn't be.\n\nRegardless of who the person is father mother etc a child should NEVER be guilt tripped into giving any physical attention to a person if they are uncomfortable with it.\n\nYou want OP to teach a child that she cannot say no to her father regardless of how she feels.

Stop projecting your own issues she says no and hurts her fathers feelings doing so hence she is not the victim!

Imagine arguing like this when none of your argument is actually happening this is the real problem. She does not have to hug him but can\u2019t get mad if he doesn\u2019t ignore her constant rejection of him. She is old enough to act this way she is old enough for the consequences!

I was just trying to point out the danger in excusing or minimizing someone\u2019s bad behavior by thinking there is something wrong with the victim. \n\nMaybe OP\u2019s child is a victim of SA.

As is his petty behaviour when it comes to how he treats her when he is angry.\n\nFurthermore, his behaviour is conditioning her that her boundries do not matter, or have to be compromised if the peace in the house is to be kept. The only way for her dad not to be angry at her at her and withhold his love from her is if she lets him hug her when she does not want to. This is unacceptable and will have a detrimental effect on how she forms relationships with men and people later on in her life. The OP describes this as something that has been going on for a while. It is highly concerning. \n\nHe needs to cut this shit out and get therapy for  his behavioural issues, or she needs to remove her child from his influence. Immediately."]}
