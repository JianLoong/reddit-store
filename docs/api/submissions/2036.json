{"id": 2036, "submission_id": "ys9ijv", "title": "AITA for telling my child she doesn\u2019t have to hug anyone, including her dad?", "selftext": "This has been an ongoing battle for the last couple years, so just looking for some input. \n\nMy (37F) family consists of my husband, we\u2019ll call him H for simplicity, (35M), and our 3 kids J (11F), O (7M), and L (1M). H is the father of all 3. O is autistic and H, while never formally tested, also has autistic tendencies. They both LOVE hugs/cuddles/physical affection and get along great. \n\nJ and myself prefer not to be hugged/touched unless we are in the mood for it or request it. Now, as a married adult I try to give H more physical affection than I want because it is his love language and I try to show him love in his terms sometimes (according to him, it is still not often enough). But J is a tween girl. She dislikes us half the time just for existing. Sometimes she will give me hugs, but I make sure they are on her terms and don\u2019t demand them. \n\nH, on the other hand, will ask her for a hug (because I told him he had to ask after previous arguments between them from him forcing them on her), and then get super pissed at her if she says no. When I tell him that it is her right to do so, he then yells at me. \n\nFor example, before school this morning, J was moody (this is typical, she is NOT a morning person). He told her Good Morning and she sorta grunted in response. Then he asked her for a hug and she shook her head no and came downstairs for breakfast. After, she needed to run back upstairs to use the restroom before we left. She voiced concern that her dad was upstairs and seemed mad at her for saying no before. I reminded her that she does not have to hug anyone if she doesn\u2019t want, and that I\u2019d remind him if it came up. Of course, he asked her again for a hug when she came out of the bathroom. She declined, he started fussing at her about disrespect and she came back downstairs to me. \n\nHe started yelling down the stairs about how she was disrespecting him and that was no excuse for a child to not hug her own dad. I told him that he asked and she is allowed to say \u201cno\u201d. She doesn\u2019t like unwanted hugs and didn\u2019t want one. When the kids headed out to school I asked them to yell \u201cbye\u201d up to their dad who was still getting dressed. O immediately did, J quietly said she was feeling too angry at him for yelling at her. He yelled back down \u201cI love you O\u201d, but said nothing to her (so mature, I know). \nThen H came down and bitched at me for always taking J\u2019s side with the affection issue. He says I am going to turn her into a disrespectful brat who doesn\u2019t listen to her parents and says he \u201cisn\u2019t having that in his house\u201d. I responded calmly, but did not change my views. He left for work mad at me too.\n\nH has always gotten along better with O than with J. But to literally tell one child he loves them and ignore the other really upsets me\u2026 \n\nAnyway, AITA for taking my daughter\u2019s side and telling her she doesn\u2019t HAVE to hug anyone, even her dad?", "created_utc": 1668170910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys9ijv/aita_for_telling_my_child_she_doesnt_have_to_hug/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s no reason a child should be forced to accept affection or give affection she doesn\u2019t want. If you force her to give or accept any kind of affection you\u2019re setting her up to be abused by a partner because she will already have the idea that she can\u2019t say no. Absolutely allow her to choose her own time and kind of affection.  My granddaughter doesn\u2019t like kisses on the lips and hasn\u2019t since she was a little over a year old. I one time forced that issue until I read one of these stories about a woman not making her 2 year old to give grandma a hug. It hit me that all kids should have that right and started giving my granddaughter a kiss on the cheek or forehead or top of her head. She loves hugs and kisses but never on the lips.

Have you asked your husband if the lesson he wants to teach her is that she should give in to male anger when she\u2019s offered physical affection and declines? When her first date tries to feel her up and she says no, should she meekly give it up when he gets pouty and pissy? Your husband is prioritizing his short term need for superficial affection over the very real long term needs of your daughter. He is an asshole. And not saying he loves her? Also incredibly emotionally manipulative. I guess he also wants her to learn that when she declines sex on some future occasion it\u2019s totally normal and acceptable for her would-be partner to ignore her and not love her anymore because her only purpose in life is to make whatever man is nearby temporarily and superficially happy. \n\nThis post made me so angry. Your husband is a giant fucking asshole.", "NTA", "NTA, I am 100% with you on the hugging thing.\n\nHowever, if this is a regular conflict, you need to find solutions to it. You say your husband said good morning, and your daughter grunted. She needs to be taught that there are expectations: she needs to answer something civil when greeted. I bet if she had said \u201cgood morning dad\u201d, he might not have felt the need to escalate this. It is important to learn that whether she is grumpy in the morning or not, being civil is a basic expectation.\n\nYour husband feels disrespected and is trying to assert control by forcing hugs. The way he is going about it is terrible and he 100% needs to stop. But you could also try to teach both of them to redirect; if she doesn\u2019t want to hug, can she offer him a hi-5 instead? Find a special nickname for him she only uses affectionately? Do a fist bump? Would a kiss on the forehead be ok with her? Could he kiss her hand? Sitting down with both of them and talking it out might be a good idea.\n\nYour husband is going about this 100% the wrong way. What he wants is to communicate affection to his child, and what he is doing is making her fearful of physical contact and teaching her there are expectations on her physical availability.

You can advocate for your daughter's needs without saying it the way you did.  You literally seem to be encouraging a distance between your husband and daughter.   I think you'd be better off saying something like: \"I understand your preference for less hugs but he's your dad and you might one day not regret giving him more hugs.  Just something to consider.\" Instead of encouraging her to tell him no.  You could also talk to your husband in a kinder way about it since you know physical affection is his love language.  He probably WANTS to hug all of his children. I can't imagine denying my dad a hug whether he wanted one or not.  I think it's concerning that your daughter is opposed to hugging her dad.  I think therapy might be needed to get to the bottom of this because it's IMO very normal to hug your dad.\n\nAnd your husband shouldn't withhold words of love just because daughter isn't in the mood for a hug today.

There needs to be consequences for the harm he\u2019s causing his daughter.", "Agree, these are the years where kids really start to lock in different behaviors when it comes to interpersonal relationships. You may be telling your daughter its okay not to hug someone but by not doing something to stop his reactions you're unintentionally telling her these responses are normal, to be expected and are because of her and not his own immaturity. \n\nI recommend having someone watch the kids and approach hubby with the idea of him getting therapy at the very least. Maybe daughter too, but she might be fine if he stops and apologizes.Tell him what he's teaching his daughter through his actions. And if he doesn't get it or refuses, well I'm not one to tell people to make a scene in front of their kids but do something that makes sure you're kids know his actions are not acceptable.

There are other ways to show affection. My little sister hates being hugged and will only initiate a hug once in a great while, and you know what? My family is fine with that! Want to know why? Because we actually care about not forcing her into situations that *make her uncomfortable.* Therapy is not needed here because there are *many people* out there who don't like physical affection, and nothing is wrong with them; it's just a part of who they are.
