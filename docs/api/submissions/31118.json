It will take us around 8 hours to drive there which isn\u2019t exactly a short car ride. My relationship with my parents has always been rocky. My dad is a controlling narcissist and my mom is somewhat of a alcoholic. I told my mom we would be driving up Wednesday and leaving on Saturday that way we would have Sunday to rest and not feel exhausted on Monday at work from the drive. I\u2019ve told her this multiple times. Today she called and asked me to stay Saturday to which I replied no we will be staying for part of Saturday and then driving home. She said I can\u2019t do that because she had invited people over to watch the game and had planned on me being there even though I had told her multiple times we would be leaving Saturday. She said that we could just wake up on Sunday at 6:30 am and drive back. I replied we can\u2019t do that because my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be able to help drive. For context, he works second shift and typically wakes up at 1pm, goes to work, and then comes home and is typically going to sleep around 4am. He would be too tired to drive. She then started to complain about him and his sleeping schedule, implying he\u2019s lazy. I stood my ground and she hung up on me. I feel like an ass because I know she just wants to see me but also I\u2019m really annoyed she can\u2019t respect my boundaries and has started to take it out on my partner.

Your mother is just going to get worse in person.", "NTA. Your mother needs to accept your answer and stop trying to guilt you into changing your mind. Leave as planned. I'm not too nice and I'd let her know that every time she tries to change your plans, you will remove 12 hours from the time you will be spending with her.", "NTA and if she keeps harassing you give her the option of just canceling the trip. Seriously, why would you put yourself through that?", "NTA. And if that's how she behaves, maybe you don't want to go at all...", "NTA. Consider leaving Friday.", "Get a motel when you go to Ohio. Your parents can only harass you so much before you leave and go to your private room with a door that locks and you turn off your phone for the night.\n\nAnd so your mom \u201cinvited people to watch the game\u201d on Saturday. Which is perfectly within her rights to entertain other people on Saturday. But you don\u2019t have to care. And you don\u2019t have to be there. NTA", "NTA - It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being. Your mom should respect your decision and not try to guilt-trip you into staying longer. It's unfortunate that she's taking it out on your partner, but you did the right thing by standing your ground.", "NTA. I would set a boundary of asking her not to ask again. You are staying for 3ish days and it sounds like that is already alot of time to spend with your parents. I would tell her that if she cant be satisfied with that and quit trying to manipulate and guilt trip you that you wont be coming at all. I also understand how hard it is to set those boundaries. It feels unnatural and manipulative people will frequently say things like \u201c Im only bothering you about this because I love you so much\u201d. Alrernately you could practice grey rocking her and just not respond in any way when she brings up staying past your deadline. Just dont engage in any conversation about it. It is also ok to cancel the trip. You are NTA. Do what you need to do to care for your mental health.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Otherwise she can pound sound. NTA", "NTA\n\nkeep your boundaries set and ignore the silly remarks ur mom is making. also, your situation with your parents is nearly identical to mine and im from NC + have family in OH lmao, a small world.", "NTA!  Your mom should be happy you guys are coming and respect the fact you are adults who made a decision.  I\u2019ll tell you years ago I started going on vacation for thanksgiving.  Anyone is welcome to join like this year a friend of 30 years and her husband are coming.  Thing is it\u2019s a vacation so all the holiday expectations, obligations, and BS is removed from the situation.  I still see my parents a few times a year but it not being a holiday seems to change the atmosphere", "NTA. You told her your plans. She made conflicting plans. That\u2019s her problem, not yours.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"she can\u2019t respect my boundaries\", then, do not go. The whole event will be a boxing match. She will take it out on you, and on your BF.   \n\n\nWhy are you doing this? To punish yourself, being with people who are cruel to you?", "NTA stay at your home and have a relaxing weekend", "NTA. Every time she disrespects your timetable or your SO, move up your departure time. Soon you won't have to go at all.\n\nI'm only half joking, BTW.", "She'll see you. What's the issue? NTA.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want to spend special time with you solo or anything, she wants you to join her on her couch to watch a football match? Why get mad over that, after telling her multiple times you had to leave on Saturday?", "The a-holes in my family have done the \u201cyou have to show up, I already told people you would be there\u201d thing my whole life. I have explained repeatedly it only makes me, not them, look bad if I don\u2019t come, that it\u2019s awful of them to commit to things for me before consulting, and that I absolutely oppose it. \n\nYou\u2019ll be shocked to hear their actions continue bc it\u2019s always about them looking good at my expense, never about them caring if people get to see me. NTA.", "NTA- leave the day earlier.  When dealing with narcissistic parents, you know halfway there is never enough.  They have to feel like they win.  \n\nSo yeah Ditto it's not going at all", "Be firm and tell her no. If she continues to guilt you, don\u2019t go at all. You have to stand firm.", "NTA.  Tell your mom you have let her know when you are leaving. Next time she pushes, tell her you are leaving Saturday and if she brings it up again or says anything about your partner, you are not going to come for the holiday.\n\nStay home and have a nice relaxing weekend, just the two of you.", "However much stress this trip will be in your mind, double it. You are already frustrated, your family isn\u2019t happy and you haven\u2019t even left yet! Take money you save on fuel, food, ibuprofen, and any other way you self medicate for stress and order a complete meal from restaurant or grocery store and order a relaxing stress free holiday.  Made that trip NC to OH many years so much happier staying home. Family we visited was never happy and then made visit less than fun so stayed home. Family still angry but we were happy", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you should stay home and enjoy a quiet week alone with your BF.", "NTA. She\u2019s being manipulative", "NTA. None of this is your problem. If pushing and nastiness continue, I\u2019d cancel altogether and make your own Thanksgiving with bf.", "NTA. What you are doing is what is called \"adulting\". What  your mom is doing is refusing to accept that you're an adult and capable of setting your own schedule. You don't answer to her, and if she made plans for your time without consulting you first, well, that's on her.\n\nStick to your plans. Leave for home at the time that works best ***for you***. If it means you walk out in the middle of the game, bid your family a fond farewell with a smile and a wave and then don't answer your phone until after you get back to NC. If then.", "NTA. And that you should be there to watch a game with some people she has invited is absolutely ridiculous. She really should get over herself. Maybe give the whole trip a miss this year, stay at home and have the holiday in peace and quiet?", "NTA. Just cancel. Not worth the negativity, stress, and toxicity.", "NTA, but here is my question\u2026why would you want to spend your holiday with a narcissist and an alcoholic with whom you have an admittedly rocky relationship ? Just because they\u2019re family? You\u2019ve already stated your boundary, she\u2019s pushing it. Where is the win in this situation for you?\n\nWhy not make a reservation at a really nice hotel that does a great dinner local to you and go there with your BF instead and save the headache?", "NTA. Why are you going? It's not enough for your mother, so don't put yourself out only to be moaned at for 3 days about what you're not doing. \n\n\nAnd just think of how happy the alcoholic and narcissist will be to bitch and moan about together, and to everyone else, about what a crap daughter you are. It's a gift all on its own. Happy Thanksgiving folks!", "nta and if she cant listen or ignore your boundaries then just dont go and stay home and relax.  that might teach her she cant push you around", "The boundary pushing will continue, and if she keeps making nasty comments about BF then it would just be uncomfortable for OP and BF. I would cancel too \n\nNTA OP", "I agree.  I\u2019m sorry but it sounds like a miserable trip. Stay home. Make a nice meal or go out for a meal. Watch movies. Go shopping. Go the park. Just have the holiday together.\n\nYour mom is going to unhappy no matter what you do. There is no reason for you to be unhappy also.", "Not at all."]}
