This isn't just a vacation or an informal visit. Your future in-laws should know better than to expect that they can crash your space while you're trying to get ready for this type of event.

The answer to this request would have been a \u2018no\u2019 even if they were paying for some of your wedding. You don\u2019t stay with the bride and groom in a small apartment.

These 'wedding venues' will soak the heck out of you.  A friend of my now wife recommended looking at AirBnB for possible venues.  It worked out great!  We found this mansion, really, with a beautiful panoramic view of the city and a ton of rooms in which to get married.  Of course, I spoke to the owners ahead of time and cleared the wedding with them before booking it.  It was less than thirty guests, so a very small wedding.  \n\nThere was plenty of space for all the out of town guests to have a place to crash while we enjoyed a really picturesque place to be married at very little cost relative to these 'wedding venue' places.  Just a tip.  Good luck and have a great marriage!", "No! This is not like any other time! In-laws should know better than to impose on you at a time like this. Make sure fiance is on board.

You can still have a meaningful and memorable experience eloping compared to a general wedding. All personal preference though.", "You are absolutely correct.

Your in-laws are pretty ballsy to ask to stay with you over the wedding given how busy you will be.  Your fianc\u00e9 is TA for pushing you to accommodate them.  But you are also TA for retaliating against them for not paying for your wedding.  If your reason was space/schedule over the wedding, that would be reasonable.

That kind of pettiness and grudge-holding is toxic to relationships.", "I am gonna play devil's advocate and go NAH. Apologies in advance, I tend to be verbose with my explanations. \n\nIf your in-laws normally stay with you, it's not completely unreasonable to expect to stay with you this time. They literally might not have considered how chaotic it might be that weekend and who else will need to be there that weekend. Them floating the idea might also just be seeing what you two expected as well since, usually, they stay with you when they visit. It could be a case of not wanting to offend you by making assumptions about either way (staying at a hotel or with you). \n\nNot letting them stay with you because they did not help with the wedding is petty. If you were saying no because your apartment will be chaotic and you need the space for the bridesmaids, that would be one thing but your primary reason is because you feel that you shouldn't help them when they won't help you. IMO, being petty doesn't make you an AH, especially due to everything else going on that weekend and the size of your apartment. \n\nYour fianc\u00e8e is calling you an AH because you are being petty and punishing her parents for something you have said they don't owe you. If your reasoning was more to do with logistics instead of money, I don't think she would have made that comment. She might still ask that they stay because it would be nice and help them out but she likely would not be as upset. Being upset that her fiance wants to have his cake and eat it too does not make her an AH either. \n\nPerhaps explaining needing the space for the bridesmaids to get ready and how chaotic your apartment will be that weekend might be good idea. That way they know you have thought of those reasons as well and it's not just about money.

I would separate this from them not paying- if they\u2019d written you a check for $50k and said they expected to stay with you and you to stay there after the wedding that would be equally unacceptable. Honestly, I\u2019m amazed they asked- presumably you\u2019re going back to the apartment after the wedding. I\u2019m all for healthy attitudes towards sex, but I think most parents would be somewhat uncomfortable with front row seats to the level of enthusiasm and frequency that will be following the wedding. \n\nAnd I mean, if they\u2019re not getting a hotel, and you are, at that point it\u2019s just ridiculous.

Fortunately, since your wedding is some time away there is plenty of time to dive into these issues.  I think that you and fianc\u00e9 need to have some very long conversations about boundaries.

Wedding and honey moon time is already stressful enough.

Expecting to stay with a couple getting married is both weird and presumptuous.

You need your home, your safe space as the kids call it these days, to either decompress or connect. \n\nI\u2019ve been a wedding photographer for almost as long as you been alive. Here is my take: \n\nWeddings are hard and stressful to navigate because it sets you up to the hard parts of marriage. If you two can\u2019t come together to navigate planning a wedding then it really means you probably can\u2019t survive the trenches you will find yourself in later in your marriage. You have navigate family Dynamics that are going to set the precedent. If you give in now, you will always be expected to give in. If they decide to blow things up, if your FW throws up red flags it\u2019s going to give you an idea of exactly what the rest of your life will look like except probably worse as you age, they age, buy a home, add children etc. \n\nYou are absolutely entitled to this boundary.  My advice to you is pay close attention to both red and green flags. Pay attention to how this is being navigated, how they arguing and making up are happening. The focus is on the wedding now, but it\u2019s really setting up a pattern here and if it\u2019s giving you the ick you need to sit with that feeling.", "Yeahhhhh NO. they want to stay they should insist to help pay.", "Your fiance needs a reset button.

Not having them to stay during the wedding is totally legitimate, you've got enough going on without having to host guests. \n\nBut that's not why you've said no.

Do better, OP.", "If there are no kids involved to burden the ILs, then make them get a hotel room, and tell them you want to stay in it on your wedding night. \n\nEither you\u2019ll get a wedding night in a hotel room, or they\u2019ll huff and say they\u2019ll stay there.
