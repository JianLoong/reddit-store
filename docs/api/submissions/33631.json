Of all possible times for them to stay over, during your wedding prep has to be one of the worst.\n\nAlso, who invited them to stay with you? Nobody should expect to stay with you without an invitation to do so. A self-invitation is amazingly presumptuous.\n\nPaying nothing for the wedding and trying to avoid the cost of the hotel labels your in-laws as either poor or penny pinchers.\n\nETA an observation:\n\n>They told us that since they didn\u2019t get any help with theirs, they won\u2019t be helping us.\n\nWhile it's true they don't owe you anything, this reason doesn't look good. It looks like they're irritated at not getting help paying for their wedding, so they're passing the irritation to the next generation.", "NTA\n\nIt is you *wedding*. This isn't just a vacation or an informal visit. Your future in-laws should know better than to expect that they can crash your space while you're trying to get ready for this type of event. Talk about entitlement! Also, red flag territory for your future wife. You're not an A-hole for wanting to set a reasonable boundary to protect your space during what will no doubt be a hectic, chaotic time.", "NTA, you are too busy and focused on the wedding to host house guests.  No contribution to the wedding?   They can rent a hotel room. \n\nSend them links to some well situated hotels,  and let them know ow well in advance e that you are not able to host them during the wedding.\n\nCongrats, hope that conversation goes well.", "NTA. The answer to this request would have been a \u2018no\u2019 even if they were paying for some of your wedding. You don\u2019t stay with the bride and groom in a small apartment. Not helping financially at all and then expecting to stay in your apartment? Good lord. Fuck that noise.", "NTA\n\nThere's no room for your future in-laws.\n\nThey should get a hotel.\n\nIf you intended doesn't understand that, get used to her parents calling the shots.  That will be your life.\n\nGood Luck", "Oh no, you need to shut this down hard. Wedding weeks are stressful and having extra people in your home has the potential for disaster. I get that they don\u2019t want to contribute to costs, that\u2019s their prerogative, but their clothes, travel and lodging are 100% on them.

And y'all will be busy and stressed enough during that time.\n\nThat aside, I'm only commenting to offer some great advice from which I benefitted when I got married regarding saving money on the venue.  These 'wedding venues' will soak the heck out of you.  A friend of my now wife recommended looking at AirBnB for possible venues.  It worked out great!  We found this mansion, really, with a beautiful panoramic view of the city and a ton of rooms in which to get married.  Of course, I spoke to the owners ahead of time and cleared the wedding with them before booking it.  It was less than thirty guests, so a very small wedding.  \n\nThere was plenty of space for all the out of town guests to have a place to crash while we enjoyed a really picturesque place to be married at very little cost relative to these 'wedding venue' places.  Just a tip.  Good luck and have a great marriage!", "No! This is not like any other time! In-laws should know better than to impose on you at a time like this. Make sure fiance is on board. She should tell them,\"Of course not! It's our wedding weekend!\"", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e seriously wants her parents in your home on her wedding night? Nothing says sexy like sharing a wall with mommy and daddy.", "It's your wedding and you don't need them taking up space. Kind of bold of them to expect you to save them money when they specifically told you that they don't want to help you at all. Fuck them. NTA", "They definitely need to get a hotel room. It\u2019s stressful enough with a wedding happening.", "NTA.\n\nIt's entitled of them to assume they can stay with you ever without an invitation, but especially during wedding preparations.", "NTA\n\n  \nTrying to stay with the bride and groom during the wedding night is a HARD NO.", "NTA. Ask her if she wants silent post nuptial sexy times because they\u2019re in the next room, or to bang like newlyweds. \n\nI hate when people pull this shit. It\u2019s selfish.", "Absolutely not. This is beyond rude and extremely cheap of them. This is going to be stressful and exhausting and you don't need people milling about who have made it clear they don't want to help at all. I can't get over the audacity. You wife needs to lay down the law now, or welcome to your life for the future.", "Wait..... your in laws want to be int he apartment on your wedding night?? Even if you already live together, this is your wedding night. \n\nYou know who should be in your apartment on your wedding night? You and your wife. That's it. That is whe whole list. \n\nSo regardsless of if they pay for the wedding. On the wedding night they should not be in your apartment.", "NTA-it's not reasonable to expect to stay in a 2 bedroom apartment with the bride and groom full stop. Add in the chaos of the bridesmaids getting ready and I'm pretty sure they've made films about that!\n\nHaving said that, you're not really ok with their not helping with the cost of the wedding and how you worded your post could read like you said no to their staying with you as retaliation for that. Be clear with your fianc\u00e9e that the reason is space and common sense, not finances. Otherwise this is going to fester.", "Nta. You want to be able to come home to a parent free house...\n\nAlthough if you can I recommend getting a hotel room for night of. Just makes it feel different from coming home on any other night", "NTA \n\nIt's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when there's financial strain, and your future in-laws have chosen not to contribute to the wedding expenses. Suggesting they get a hotel for the wedding day makes practical sense and ensures a smoother event\n\nPS: Have you looked into eloping if you don't have the thousands for a generic wedding? Even some people with money choose to elope because they don't see why you would spend much money on one day rather than putting that money towards a lengthy vacation or something else. You can still have a meaningful and memorable experience eloping compared to a general wedding. All personal preference though.", "You are absolutely correct. They can get a hotel room. \n\nPeople who cheap out on their kids weddings...any special event....need to take care of their own travel and accommodation. \n\nTell your fiancee no way.", "Nta", "NTA- you guys will be busy and stressed already that week.

The audacity.", "INFO: You say the apartment is where your fiance will be getting ready with her bridesmaids? Where will you be getting ready? Are you staying seperate to your fiancee before the wedding? And are you guys staying in the apartment the night of the wedding?", "ESH.  Your in-laws are pretty ballsy to ask to stay with you over the wedding given how busy you will be.  Your fianc\u00e9 is TA for pushing you to accommodate them.  But you are also TA for retaliating against them for not paying for your wedding.  If your reason was space/schedule over the wedding, that would be reasonable.  But that\u2019s not your motivation, you want to get back at them for not paying for the wedding.  That kind of pettiness and grudge-holding is toxic to relationships.", "I am gonna play devil's advocate and go NAH. Apologies in advance, I tend to be verbose with my explanations. \n\nIf your in-laws normally stay with you, it's not completely unreasonable to expect to stay with you this time. They literally might not have considered how chaotic it might be that weekend and who else will need to be there that weekend. Them floating the idea might also just be seeing what you two expected as well since, usually, they stay with you when they visit. It could be a case of not wanting to offend you by making assumptions about either way (staying at a hotel or with you). \n\nNot letting them stay with you because they did not help with the wedding is petty. If you were saying no because your apartment will be chaotic and you need the space for the bridesmaids, that would be one thing but your primary reason is because you feel that you shouldn't help them when they won't help you. IMO, being petty doesn't make you an AH, especially due to everything else going on that weekend and the size of your apartment. \n\nYour fianc\u00e8e is calling you an AH because you are being petty and punishing her parents for something you have said they don't owe you. If your reasoning was more to do with logistics instead of money, I don't think she would have made that comment. She might still ask that they stay because it would be nice and help them out but she likely would not be as upset. Being upset that her fiance wants to have his cake and eat it too does not make her an AH either. \n\nPerhaps explaining needing the space for the bridesmaids to get ready and how chaotic your apartment will be that weekend might be good idea. That way they know you have thought of those reasons as well and it's not just about money. Best of luck OP!", "YTA.\n\n\nIf you had said that you had no room and so they couldn't stay that would be fine but what you said was they didn't give you any money for the wedding so they can go and stay in a hotel.\n\nYou say it's fine that they didn't give you any money but actually it's not fine and that's your reason for doing this which makes you the a******", "How big is your house?", "YTA They are your wife\u2019s parents.  You want to start off your marriage by refusing your in-laws?\n\nyour reason is petty and vindictive.  They didn\u2019t help pay for the wedding and they are too cheap to get a hotel?

If you are organising and paying for your own wedding, away from family, pressure will be on you both in the build up thpo the wedding.

I would separate this from them not paying- if they\u2019d written you a check for $50k and said they expected to stay with you and you to stay there after the wedding that would be equally unacceptable. Honestly, I\u2019m amazed they asked- presumably you\u2019re going back to the apartment after the wedding. I\u2019m all for healthy attitudes towards sex, but I think most parents would be somewhat uncomfortable with front row seats to the level of enthusiasm and frequency that will be following the wedding. \n\nAnd I mean, if they\u2019re not getting a hotel, and you are, at that point it\u2019s just ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t frame this in terms of $ they didn\u2019t provide, I\u2019d just sit down with fianc\u00e9e and explain from a logistics standpoint this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nIf I was you I\u2019d also be somewhat concerned- has her family been unreasonable generally and how has she responded? Assuming this isn\u2019t the normal dynamic I wouldn\u2019t be super worried- people get weird around weddings, especially brides, and your fianc\u00e9e wanting her parents to be there and be happy is totally normal.", "NTA, but I am adding my voice to all the other commenters that you have a fianc\u00e9 problem.  Fortunately, since your wedding is some time away there is plenty of time to dive into these issues.  I think that you and fianc\u00e9 need to have some very long conversations about boundaries.  Is he expecting his parents to move in after you two get married?  How long are his parents allowed to visit?  Those sort of issues.  You may even want to see a couples counselor to discuss these and other potential issues.
