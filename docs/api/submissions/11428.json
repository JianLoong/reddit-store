I have two daughters 15 & 17 and he has a son 19 from previous. We added two F9 and M4 to the blended family. We had custody of stepson until he did an unthinkable act to my daughters in Oct. 21. SIL45 told husband he shouldn't be supporting my daughters and he should leave me, because his son needed him. Stepson moved back to be with mom well over 1500 miles away from us. Charges were dropped which was rather frustrating but at least everyone is safe. We stopped all contact with SIL as well as stepson.\n\nNov 22 my husband received word that a relative passed. His Aunt had to deal with the planning and SIL was to inform us when services would be, this did not happen. Husband got a text from a cousin asking if he was coming. Husband asked when services were and it was too short notice as we are 3hrs away. After services, we got a call that MIL was being airlifted to the hospital as she was having a heart attack. Husband left work to be by her side even though they don't speak. He disagrees with her lifestyle but didn't want any regrets. SIL shows up at the hospital hours later after MIL was out of surgery and starts arguing with husband. Calling him hateful and selfish, he left.\n\nNote SIL is very jealous. Husband worked his way out of the life cycle he grew up in. Very rough childhood. She has chooses to live off the State, while we are mostly debt free. SIL has never asked us for help but has implied \"must be nice to have money unlike us poor people\" we are not rich, just comfortable.\n\nA week later MIL had a stroke, husband went to be with. SIL shows up to the hospital 5hrs later. Husband got up to leave and SIL started in on him. Told him he should move MIL in with us because we have the means to do so. Husband leaves and stays no contact with SIL.\n\nA month ago SIL calls husband and told him she's very sick. She's a type one diabetic who never has watched her diet and her kidneys and heart are failing. Dr. gave her a year. Husband and SIL make amends.\n\nLast night SIL calls asking if daughter 9 has birthday plans, husband tells her. Then ask me if she can come. I told him absolutely not. He reminded me she's sick and this may be her last time. I reminded him of all the mean things she's done throughout our marriage and how she has continued even after we cut ties. I told husband he could take a weekend trip to go see his sister and take our two kids. He didn't like that idea. He just figured if she had met us at the party we could be done with it. I do not want the drama as every time we're around her she is so negative and in my opinion she is cruel. She has never apologized for her behavior and I'm happy with the distance.\n\nSo am AITA for telling my husband that his sister cannot come to our daughters birthday party this weekend even though this could be her last year?", "created_utc": 1677888139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hjhvb/aita_for_telling_my_husband_his_sister_cannot/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
