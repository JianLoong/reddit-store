There is no doubt about that.  She never wanted to be there and you had to beg her to go this year.  Why does she hate your family so much?\n\nThe 'Where's Declan?' jokes would just be a bit of a joke and likely said in a light hearted banter.  There was no need for Beth to get so stroppy about it.  He's probably attended every other party your mom has thrown .\n\nIdeally it would've been better to have nipped Beth's attitude in the bud when you saw that she wasn't very happy about the comments.\n\nI'm not really sure why she is so upset about no one knowing who she is because she's never been there and never wanted to have anything to do with your family.  So this is a consequence of that.  Your parents meeting her once, years ago... well she may have looked different then ie hairstyle, clothes etc.  She may not have been that memorable.\n\nThrowing Beth out at one comment was a bit of an arse move unless what she said was really bad.  Most people would've just pulled her up on it and let know what would happen (ie get thrown out) if it happens again.\n\nIf it was a minor insulting thing she said, then perhaps you should've followed your girlfriend out which is why you may be slightly the arse but only just.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to take a good long hard look at herself.  Her response to this is out of proportion.  She did the wrong thing, she didn't want to be there, she was rude... but it doesn't seem as though she wants to take any responsibility for her behaviour.\n\nAny other red flags?  Do you need to take a good long hard look at this relationship and whether this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?", "YTA. You put her in an uncomfortable situation, where she was being made fun of, you weren\u2019t sticking up for her, and when she got upset, you let your mom ask  her to leave and you didn\u2019t go with her. Do you even like her? I\u2019d say E S H, except the way you and your mom treated her, I think I understand why she\u2019s not comfortable around your family.", "NTA, but man, why are you with this woman? She\u2019s a terror. She\u2019s mean to your folks. What are you getting out of this?", "YTA. It was **your** idea to drag her into the lion's den. A situation that, at *base*, she found unpleasant. And what happened was that many a guest she met either made light of her or said something unintentionally belittling or exclusionary. I do not read one thing that you did to try to check in with her, stick up for her during those awkward moments, or try to make her more comfortable. It is not surprising that she could not handle the situation, and it was your blasted idea in the first place. Next time, take the fall with her.\n\nAnd while you're at it, tell your mother her guests are rude and should carry themselves better when meeting someone new and awkward for the first time. No matter how much of a stink that causes.", "I'm leaning ESH right now.\n\nINFO\n\nWhy are you and Beth together? Like it's clear she doesn't like your family, and yet you are willing to marry her?\n\nThis sounds like a recipe for disaster because she shouldn't have these issues going into a relationship.\n\nHonestly, Beth can't get too upset if other people don't know who she is because she never attends these gatherings in the first place.\n\nI do feel like you needed to leave with your fianc\u00e9 because she felt alone.", "Beth doesn\u2019t like your family, she doesn\u2019t like your chosen family, she doesn\u2019t care enough about you to attend these parties a couple times a year\u2026 so why exactly are you going to marry her? ESH", "YTA as are your parents and their friends. Your parents friends are rude and they kicked Beth out. Ugh.", "Yep, YTA. I can see why she doesn\u2019t like your family or those they keep company with. You may just find yourself included in that group.", "YTA, you should be doing more to improve Beth's relationship with your family if you really are wanting to marry her. It's going to be a pretty tough life if she doesn't get along with them.", "NTA\n\nShe put herself in that situation by constantly declining party offers. So much so that people didn\u2019t think she existed. Lol. I don\u2019t know why you had to leave with her when she was the rude one. Fortunately I think it\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll have to worry about bringing her with you. Declan is the way to go", "YTA \n\nI have questions. Why are you marrying her family is so important to you? Why does she reject the family of the person she's marrying? Could you not have done more to defend her, and prevent the whole \"Where's Declan?\" thing? How did we escalate to insulting someone's intelligence? Feels like she snapped when the rather tasteless \"joke\" was pushed too far. My instincts are saying there is more to this story, both in how Beth was treated by your family in the past  and during this party, parts that are not in your favor.\n\nNevertheless, the parts I do see, you failing to defend against that \"joke\" and when she was kicked out are enough for me to conclude you are in the wrong.", "ESH You shouldn't have begged her to go and thrown her to lions. The joke was stupid. Guests are supposed to be made to feel welcome not the butt of a joke. Your girlfriend handled it poorly, snapped and was asked to leave. It sounds like there is enough blame to go around.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what so many people aren\u2019t seeing what a big pile of red flags she is.", "YTA. You don't treat your fianc\u00e9e like this if you really care for her, which I doubt very much that you do. A real man would stand up for his partner, in all circumstances. Which I am sure you will do when you and Declan announce your engagement.", "YTA - you want to marry her but won\u2019t stand up for her when people were constantly rude and dismissive? Good luck with that bud. She\u2019s better off without someone who deprioritise\u2019s her over others\u2026wow", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But not Beth joke towards your family. \n\nThere is an old saying.  Treat others as you would be treated.  They treated beth like a joke. So she treated them like a joke.)\n\nYou were laughing at her. But refused to laugh at the joke about your family?\n\nYTA - for not defending beth sooner.  You been together for how long and you couldn't read her mood to know she wasn't enjoy her relationship with you being made out to be some kind of joke?  \n\nParents - AH, kicking beth out without so much as trying to deescalate?  They had meet her.  But yet they were ok with the majority of the guests making out like she was a escort playing the role of your imaginary girlfriend?  I don't know what kind of jokes were being made.  So I went for the very worst.\n\nEdit: mega AH now.  \n\nBeth - NTA.  If someone called her a prostitute.  Then yeah.  I would be standing right by her in her rebuttal regardless of how disrespectful it was.  AH or not.  No one deserves to be disrespected.  For argument shake.  I will just assume Beth impolitely told your uncle his deceased wife is a glory hole in the underworld.  \nHowever, OP, all Beth did was make a joke about the person who made jokes about her. \n\"it's amazing someone would trust you to work their case when you can't even deduce someone's relationship status.\" Beth comments according to the OP.\n\nThat isn't being AH.  That is joining the crowd and returning the treatment.  \n\nFamily - AH.  Facial expressions are a universal language around the world.  They did not care how put off or unnerved she was becoming.  It was a joke. Oddly enough.  I doubt she was laughing or smiling.  Meaning, your family didn't care about her feelings or your relationship.  \n\nSo ESH! \n\n\n - while you may not have agreed with beth actions.  The jokes about her being fake, and the lack of regard for her existence isn't cool.  \n\nBeth went on a two hour drive (four hours to and form?) to have her relationship with you was nothing more then a joke?  To discover that she was nothing more then your imaginary girlfriend.  \n\nEveryone is entitled to there own feelings, and some people do not like being made fun of.  You should have left with her, even if you did not argee with her actions.\n\nEdit: changed Beth from being an AH to NTA.  Read through the comments.  Per OP, Beth made a joke, \"it's amazing someone would trust you to work their case when you can't even deduce someone's relationship status.\" \nWhich if you are going to make jokes about someone and you get offended when they make a joke about you.

She should have just laughed along--or at least not snapped like an emotional teenager. \n\nYou should have just let her stay home.", "ESH - first, it's not cool for Beth to snap at someone and insult their intelligence, and I'm generally confused about your relationship given that she's your fiancee and seems quite uninterested in connecting with an important part of your life in any way.\n\nThat said, she's your fiancee, she came with you, at your request, so if things go south you have a primary responsibility to her.

I told my mother then, \"I love you, but never make me choose between my wife and you.  You won't like the choice.\"  Fortunately, my mother wound up loving my now-wife and they got along great.  When I married my wife, I took a vow to put her well-being before any one else's and I take that vow very seriously (we've been married 28 years).  I will always defend my wife to others.  Always.
