I ended up telling my husband and he started hysterically laughing and told me that he never heard her sing. I ignored him and texted my MIL and asked her to send me a video of her singing Best Part by H.E.R. 10mins later she sent me a video and IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! I told her that I would just hire a professional because she should have told me she was still learning how to sing. She GOT LIVID she told his whole family that I told her she was a horrible singer. She no longer wants to attend the wedding his sisters also doesn't want to attend because they feel like I disrespected her. My husband feels like I did nothing wrong.

Although, you could have let her down a bit more gently, but that is not on you. You did her a favour in not letting her embarrass herself in front of everyone.  Also, its your wedding, and you should be able to decide what you want at it.", "ESH. How you handled that was very rude. You could have told her \u201cthank you for the offer but Jim and I thought it\u2019d be more special to have a professional so you\u2019d be free for the mother son dance\u201d or something, anything else. You probably embarrassed her.", "Send a recording of her singing to each sister saying,  \"Found a singer that will do it for free! What do you think?\" Make sure they can't see who it is.", "You could have left off the ' you should have told me you were still learning part'. IMO. But she blew your comment out of proportion. NTA", "NTA - god, I hate people like this. Our family is insanely close, but they never tried taking over the entire wedding of my sister. Like, know your place! If you want to hire a professional singer, that\u2019s what you should do. No one should be subjected to her horrible singing. If she\u2019s willing to drop out of the wedding for this much, she probably didn\u2019t care as much in the first place", "NTA\n\nIf her attendance at her own son\u2019s wedding is conditional on being told she can hold a tune, she clearly doesn\u2019t give a sh1t about her son.", "NTA, I mean maybe you could\u2019ve been nicer but if she genuinely was that bad, you saved her the embarrassment.", "NTA. you did what was best for your big day. They'll get over it eventually", "NTA.That's your wedding.You can decide everything.", "I want to watch the video or at least hear the recording, for a good laugh\ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA. Old Woman throws a strop because your big day isn't going to be about her. I wouldn't even worry about this because when she realizes you're not an idiot she will come crawling back.

She shouldn't have pushed it and you shouldn't have essentially told her that she couldn't sing. There were so many other things you could have said.", "Yeah, tell them it\u2019s someone she found on Facebook and wants their opinion", "I didn't say it in front of anyone it was a text between me and her she went and told everyone what happened.", "I\u2019m aware. Just because it was a private conversation doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t embarrassing to her. To think you\u2019re good at something and be excited to share it with someone that you care about and have them shut you down it\u2019s not only hurtful but embarrassing. She probably told others to gain validation and affirmation on what she believes is her talent. Not saying what she did was right but you had the responsibility of keeping her feelings in mind when you asked her for the audition video and you crushed her. Intentionally or not. There were better ways to turn her down and you know that.", "YTA. Your MIL probably wanted to sing a song for sentimental reasons. As long as she was enjoying herself and was doing it out of love you should have let her sing at least one song, then suggested getting someone else for the rest of the wedding. Even if you were determined not to let her sing in case guests might laugh at her, you should never have been so blunt as to tell her she can't sing, you could have made up an excuse about not wanting her to miss out on the wedding, and offered her a different part to play, like making a speech or being the MC for the music or something. I think you should apologize and give her some other role to make her feel like she has a part to play on the day.", "You should have let your future husband to handle his mother not you.", "YTA", "NTA. Singing at a wedding is not normally an amateur occupation. That\u2019s why they cost money.", "I don't understand why letting Mil down gently is 'not on' OP. It's her mother in law, and it's in OP's interest to try and maintain a good relationship (although in fairness she sounds like a pill.)\n\nWhy not just say 'I'll hire a professional because I want you to be able to enjoy the wedding and spend time with us' instead of sliding in an insult?", "Except MIL is either completely narcissistic or delusional about her abilities. If OP tried to be circumspect about it then MIL would take the opportunity to do a special song as a present or similar nonsense. \n\nBeing straightforward has its place when you\u2019re making sure boundaries are clear. MIL not singing at the wedding is a boundary.", "Nta.  I was at a friends wedding many years ago and had to sit through one of their relatives struggle through just one song at the wedding.  It was torture.  I couldn\u2019t imagine a whole night of it.", "ESH. Your MIL doesn\u2019t have a good voice, which is fine but you were not kind in how you told her. You could have said something like, \u201cThank you for the video! We\u2019ll keep you in mind.\u201d It\u2019s also crummy of her to force herself on you, and for her daughters to do the same. They have to know she sucks. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a crappy singer in your wedding, but you don\u2019t have to be brutally honest with someone you\u2019re stuck with for a long time.", "The OP's handling of this is just weird though. Did her soon to be husband even want his mother to be their wedding singer ? He apparently laughed and said he'd never heard her sing, and she ignored him.\nAnd neither the sisters nor the fianc\u00e9's reaction to Mom's offer would really give a lot of confidence that Mom is a good singer. \n\nThe OP also could have let her down easier. Something like \"I don't think your voice is a good fit for what we had in mind, but thanks for offering.\" \n\nESH", "Being clear is one thing, being rude is another. No matter how you spin it, saying what she said was rude. She could have been clear without putting MIL down."]}
