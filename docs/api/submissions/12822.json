Shes not what I\u2019d call a \u201cclose\u201d friend but I\u2019ve known her a long time. She\u2019s the type of person who always thinks she\u2019s right and won\u2019t back down easily from anything. \n\nA few months ago she had toothache and asked me which dentist I used. My dentist is amazing so I recommended him. She has a dental phobia and asked me to go with her to her appointment.\n\nHe was lovely to her. Spent a long time talking to her, explaining everything, put her at her ease. She had a big abscess under one of her back teeth. He said it either needed root canal and a crown or extracting. The root canal/crown would be best part of \u00a31000 total and he was really clear to her that it was a big abscess and there was no guarantee root canal would work. He actually said the odds were 50/50 and it might be better to extract the tooth and put that money towards an implant or bridge instead. He said he could offer no form of guarantee/refund if problems happened. He was clear in what he said and I know she heard and understood that the odds weren\u2019t great. She decided to go ahead with the treatment. I went with her to one further appointment, but not all of them.\n\nFast forward a few months. Everything was ok initially after the root canal and crown but then she got another infection. She had antibiotics but the problem persisted and she ended up having the tooth out.\n\nShe is livid. You\u2019d think he was the worst person in the world from what she says about him. She wants to sue him and has been to a lawyer to get advice. She is claiming that she wasn\u2019t properly warned that the treatment may not work. Apparently the lawyer is confident she\u2019ll get a payout. He\u2019s told her that it\u2019ll be hard for him to prove he properly warned her and dentists are insured for this stuff. They think his insurance will pay out because it won\u2019t be worth their time to try and defend it.\n\nI am really annoyed at her for this because I know she is lying about not being warned. I really like the dentist and feel awful for him that he faces legal action for this - and that I was the one who introduced her to him. I worry that it will reflect badly on me in his eyes when I see him in the future. I have argued with her about it because I witnessed him warning her but she says it's none of my business. Her view is it doesn\u2019t hurt him because he\u2019ll have insurance. Like I said, she doesn\u2019t back down from things.\n\nI feel so strongly about this that I want to send a written statement to the dentist that he can use back against her. I would state that I witnessed the appointment when he warned her and that she clearly heard and understood what he said.\n\nI know that in doing so I would probably lose her as a friend but to be honest I don\u2019t care about that at this point. My husband thinks I should do it. He\u2019s never liked Jean. He describes her as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and thinks I\u2019m best off without her as a friend.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I did this?", "created_utc": 1679398843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xeav7/wibta_if_i_gave_my_dentist_a_written_statement_to/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
