Shes not what I\u2019d call a \u201cclose\u201d friend but I\u2019ve known her a long time. She\u2019s the type of person who always thinks she\u2019s right and won\u2019t back down easily from anything. \n\nA few months ago she had toothache and asked me which dentist I used. My dentist is amazing so I recommended him. She has a dental phobia and asked me to go with her to her appointment.\n\nHe was lovely to her. Spent a long time talking to her, explaining everything, put her at her ease. She had a big abscess under one of her back teeth. He said it either needed root canal and a crown or extracting. The root canal/crown would be best part of \u00a31000 total and he was really clear to her that it was a big abscess and there was no guarantee root canal would work. He actually said the odds were 50/50 and it might be better to extract the tooth and put that money towards an implant or bridge instead. He said he could offer no form of guarantee/refund if problems happened. He was clear in what he said and I know she heard and understood that the odds weren\u2019t great. She decided to go ahead with the treatment. I went with her to one further appointment, but not all of them.\n\nFast forward a few months. Everything was ok initially after the root canal and crown but then she got another infection. She had antibiotics but the problem persisted and she ended up having the tooth out.\n\nShe is livid. You\u2019d think he was the worst person in the world from what she says about him. She wants to sue him and has been to a lawyer to get advice. She is claiming that she wasn\u2019t properly warned that the treatment may not work. Apparently the lawyer is confident she\u2019ll get a payout. He\u2019s told her that it\u2019ll be hard for him to prove he properly warned her and dentists are insured for this stuff. They think his insurance will pay out because it won\u2019t be worth their time to try and defend it.\n\nI am really annoyed at her for this because I know she is lying about not being warned. I really like the dentist and feel awful for him that he faces legal action for this - and that I was the one who introduced her to him. I worry that it will reflect badly on me in his eyes when I see him in the future. I have argued with her about it because I witnessed him warning her but she says it's none of my business. Her view is it doesn\u2019t hurt him because he\u2019ll have insurance. Like I said, she doesn\u2019t back down from things.\n\nI feel so strongly about this that I want to send a written statement to the dentist that he can use back against her. I would state that I witnessed the appointment when he warned her and that she clearly heard and understood what he said.\n\nI know that in doing so I would probably lose her as a friend but to be honest I don\u2019t care about that at this point. My husband thinks I should do it. He\u2019s never liked Jean. He describes her as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and thinks I\u2019m best off without her as a friend.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I did this?", "created_utc": 1679398843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xeav7/wibta_if_i_gave_my_dentist_a_written_statement_to/", "score": 5248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was warned, she chose to ignore the warning, now she's upset about the consequences.  He shouldn't have to have a black mark on his record because she is mad that she didn't get the result she wanted, even when she was told it was only 50/50.  Jean is not a good person.  Even in her 50's she still has never learned to acknowledge when she her own mistakes and finds it easier to punish others.  And yes, it will hurt him, it's going to impact his insurance which means he pays more.  So, please, go give him the written statement that you were there with her in the office and that he clearly explained everything to her.

It will help in the potential defense definitely and also on a level perhaps reassure your dentist. Aside from that, most dentists have the patient sign an informed consent agreement for any treatment like root canal or extractions. So if he has that in the records there is in reality most likely no case if he did nothing negligent and practiced to the standard of care.  That being said any lawsuit against a professional even if it\u2019s a nuisance lawsuit is in extremely stressful and time-consuming. I wonder what your friend is looking for. Is it a refund of the fee or supposed damages. Please write the letter. I\u2019m a retired dentist and did have a nuisance lawsuit and it was hell having to defend myself.

Guaranteed that this lady is pulling similar scams in other areas of her life.", "My mom and I used to sort of joke about my brother in this regard. He was a pathological liar but it was like ... As soon as he spoke it became true to him.", "When I had my wisdom teeth out, my mom insisted on me being surgically sedated, and it was so worth it. The dentists I went to were so damn good, I didn't even have to take pain killers post op. They gave me some, but I had zero pain after having them taken out.", "She probably lawyer shopped until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear. And the lawyer is happy to take her fees on a losing case", "Yes, this.\n\nIt would be one thing if the OP were coming forward as a simple character witness, then the affidavit might suffice.\n\nBut it sounds like she was a direct witness to the conversation that\u2019s at the heart of the case, and the attorneys are going to want to ask her questions, not to just decide whether to believe or disbelieve the written narrative she\u2019s put forward.They will want to depose her, and if there\u2019s a trial they\u2019ll want her to testify.", "Sadly, there are a lot of people like that. My husband for one. He will get it in his mind that X is true - and it then is.", "\u201cShe\u2019s not what I\u2019d call a close friend\u2026.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019re telling me that she is attending a dentist appointment with someone who she doesn\u2019t even consider a close friend? That doesn\u2019t make sense at all and I am smelling bulllshit.", "SAME EXACTLY!!! i got to ketamine dream for 45 mins and then i woke up and was in no pain\ud83d\ude2d in fact my mother has a video of me crying tears of joy and vaping out my nose telling her \u201chow much i love her and how happy i was\u201d LMFAOOOO. i don\u2019t remember much of that week but from what small things i do remember, pain was definitely not one of them \ud83e\udd23 i do feel for the people that have bad experiences tho as our experiences seem to be more uncommon than not unfortunately", "no convincing was required on my moms part though i was ready to be put OUT i did not wanna be awake for that carnage", "As small as this case is I doubt it would ever go to court. Insurance will just settle. It's not a multimillion dollar malpractice case here, it's a few grand. I was eyeballing a bicycle worth more than this payout would be just the other day.", "They only time I'm voting go with what husband said. \ud83d\ude02 NTA.", "=-S\n\nMy mother got her phobia when she was a little girl. She went in for a procedure and the dentist came up behind her without her knowing and put the mask on her to give her gas. She goes from no one is there to struggling against a man holding a mask on her from behind.", "That blows my mind. I can't imagine how heartwrenching that had to be for you as a parent. I think I probably would've but the dentist that day if he had to me to hold her down myself.", "> Her view is it doesn\u2019t hurt him because he\u2019ll have insurance.\n\nThis is always said by losers with nothing worth insuring and who have no damn idea how insurance works.", "OP, tell her (and your dentist) you plan to do this ... she may back down. Otherwise they both might incur legal costs...", "Considering the dentist is also her friend this is her saving her friend from insurance fraud from a former friend. Interesting you're cool with insurance fraud tho.", ">he did the right thing and it STILL came back and bit him in the butt\n\nWhile this is true, I doubt it is the first time that this has happened to him. The only thing he can do better next time, if he isn't doing it right now, is to have (new) patients sign a waiver that confirms that the patient has received medical advice and is doing treatment that may be counterproductive to what they need.", "We're really getting to the root of the problem. If OP helps her dentist she should be crowned.", "A good dentist is worth way more than a bad friend.", "It could be documented already in the notes. Ie \u201cpt was informed that root canal has a guarded prognosis and is aware that it has a 50% success rate. Provided pt with other options (ie. exo and implant) but pt wanted to proceed with root canal.\u201d But it would absolutely help if op were to write a statement. NTA.", "I hope we get an update about this toxic friend going nuclear. NTA.", "Ditto. \n\nSigned, a patient.", "She sounds like a nightmare! She's a scammer, who is opinionated, rude and greedy. All great characteristics for a friend! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I think OP can do without her.", "My God. Wtaf", "NTA. This is a reflection of her morals.  She's willing to lie to scam an insurance company.  What else is she willing to lie  or cheat about?  How do you know she won't lie about falling at your house to get a pay out.", "In fact, I\u2019d be more than ok - I\u2019d actively be stepping away from her. \n\nNightmare is right.", "Seems like Jean is the type that makes a habit of abusing insurance.", "It\u2019s also very demoralizing for a well-intentioned, ethical health care provider to receive a lawsuit. Back the person who provided the care and drop the \u201cfriend.\u201d", "Nta.   And I wonder if, with your story, he can counter sue her for legal fees.", "Its not hearsay. She was there, in the room", "NTA\n\nIn addition to that, the OP is going to be one of the victims too.\n\nShe recommended the friend and she witnessed the warning. If she likes the dentist, how can she (or her family) go back to the same dentist after something like that?", "> It\u2019s also a bit weird to me that they aren\u2019t close friends, and yet Jean is the one that reached out to her?\n\nSounds like my Aunt Cindy who has systematically alienated everyone in her life. Every friend, every relation, every boyfriend and family member. As soon as she gets her claws in someone she leans on them heavily because she has no one else.", "Yes, I think OP would be in the wrong for NOT reaching out. Also, that insurance money doesn\u2019t get magicked up from the insurance fairies - it comes from the dentist\u2019s clients!!", "Not sure about the UK, but in the US she would have been given a waiver to sign that she acknowledges all the risks etc of having the procedure done. Should just be able to wave that at a judge and have everything sorted."]}
