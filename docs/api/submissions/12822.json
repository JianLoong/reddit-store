Shes not what I\u2019d call a \u201cclose\u201d friend but I\u2019ve known her a long time. She\u2019s the type of person who always thinks she\u2019s right and won\u2019t back down easily from anything. \n\nA few months ago she had toothache and asked me which dentist I used. My dentist is amazing so I recommended him. She has a dental phobia and asked me to go with her to her appointment.\n\nHe was lovely to her. Spent a long time talking to her, explaining everything, put her at her ease. She had a big abscess under one of her back teeth. He said it either needed root canal and a crown or extracting. The root canal/crown would be best part of \u00a31000 total and he was really clear to her that it was a big abscess and there was no guarantee root canal would work. He actually said the odds were 50/50 and it might be better to extract the tooth and put that money towards an implant or bridge instead. He said he could offer no form of guarantee/refund if problems happened. He was clear in what he said and I know she heard and understood that the odds weren\u2019t great. She decided to go ahead with the treatment. I went with her to one further appointment, but not all of them.\n\nFast forward a few months. Everything was ok initially after the root canal and crown but then she got another infection. She had antibiotics but the problem persisted and she ended up having the tooth out.\n\nShe is livid. You\u2019d think he was the worst person in the world from what she says about him. She wants to sue him and has been to a lawyer to get advice. She is claiming that she wasn\u2019t properly warned that the treatment may not work. Apparently the lawyer is confident she\u2019ll get a payout. He\u2019s told her that it\u2019ll be hard for him to prove he properly warned her and dentists are insured for this stuff. They think his insurance will pay out because it won\u2019t be worth their time to try and defend it.\n\nI am really annoyed at her for this because I know she is lying about not being warned. I really like the dentist and feel awful for him that he faces legal action for this - and that I was the one who introduced her to him. I worry that it will reflect badly on me in his eyes when I see him in the future. I have argued with her about it because I witnessed him warning her but she says it's none of my business. Her view is it doesn\u2019t hurt him because he\u2019ll have insurance. Like I said, she doesn\u2019t back down from things.\n\nI feel so strongly about this that I want to send a written statement to the dentist that he can use back against her. I would state that I witnessed the appointment when he warned her and that she clearly heard and understood what he said.\n\nI know that in doing so I would probably lose her as a friend but to be honest I don\u2019t care about that at this point. My husband thinks I should do it. He\u2019s never liked Jean. He describes her as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and thinks I\u2019m best off without her as a friend.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I did this?", "created_utc": 1679398843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xeav7/wibta_if_i_gave_my_dentist_a_written_statement_to/", "score": 979, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's proven herself to be dishonest in a way that is actively harmful and malicious, and she will have no qualms about treating you the same way should she perceive there's some financial benefit in it for her.", "NTA but I\u2019d stay completely out of it.  If there is a law suit, you could find yourself caught up in it.  If she isn\u2019t a real friend, severe ties with her.  Your dentist should have malpractice insurance anyway.", "NTA. Yes absolutely back up the dentist. I recommend the letter because he has it in writing plus he will have the assurance in writing that he is in the right that he can see anytime he might start to doubt himself. The friend isn\u2019t really a friend to ANYONE!", "NTA. But perhaps you should save the dentist even more trouble by sending a copy of the letter to her lawyer and her in advance warning them that you will not lie to support her spurious lawsuit.", "NTA, do it.  She was warned, she chose to ignore the warning, now she's upset about the consequences.  He shouldn't have to have a black mark on his record because she is mad that she didn't get the result she wanted, even when she was told it was only 50/50.  Jean is not a good person.  Even in her 50's she still has never learned to acknowledge when she her own mistakes and finds it easier to punish others.  And yes, it will hurt him, it's going to impact his insurance which means he pays more.  So, please, go give him the written statement that you were there with her in the office and that he clearly explained everything to her.  Her lawyer is probably going to be pissed that she hid that there was in fact a witness to all of this.", "NTA please write that letter! Also give your dentist a heads up. She\u2019s not a good person and it\u2019s only a matter of time before she turns on you\u2026", "NTA\n\nThat poor dentist. Jean is the only AH in this situation. You\u2019d be right to compensate him by giving a statement to help him with the case because you did introduce this nightmare of a woman to him.", "NTA. People like this are why costs are so high. Plus since you referred her he might not want you as a patient.", "NTA ...she is a scammer", "YWNBTA.  As others have said, Jean is absolutely in the wrong and your husband's judgement about her being a nightmare sounds correct.  This will affect his insurance and his professional reputation.", "NTA.   Ywbta if you didn't support your dentist. You know for a fact that he gave her all the warnings and your friend still chose to go with it. His hands are clean here and you are his only witness. And while it might not affect how he handles your future care, I do think he'd always view you in a lower light for not speaking up in his defense when you were a witness and you were the one who introduced them.", "NTA. You're doing what you think is morally right, standing up for someone that is being unjustly treated.\n\nYou will lose a friend, but i don't consider this a person you want to associate with anyway?\n\nAnd maybe insurance would pay, but he would still be affected - his insurance costs will go up, he's professional reputation will be damaged in the eyes of his colleagues and clients, and he will also be put under a lot of stress from the case. It's not fair.", "NTA but you will lose a friend so be prepared.", "NTA. Jean sucks and is looking to make someone else pay for her choice to not listen to the medical professional's advice. Back your dentist and tell Jean to hit the bricks.", "She's trying to take advantage of the dentist.\n\n\nNTA", "Go one further and talk to her lawyer. Tell him you are a witness and plan to be used as such should he take your dentist to court. NTA.", "NTA, but just so you know a written statement wouldn\u2019t necessarily be enough. They can\u2019t be used in court. You\u2019ll have to testify if it goes to trial.", "NTA and do the right thing please", "NTA.\n\nDid she need to sign a statement before the procedure saying that it isn't guaranteed to work? I had to do that at my dentist after he told me that a root canal isn't guaranteed to work.", "If it does go to court wouldn\u2019t you be called in as a witness anyways?", "NTA.\n\nIt WILL hurt the dentist. If she gets a big payout, the dentist could potentially lose his insurance or his premiums will go way up.", "NTA. Not only would you not be an AH, you'd be a good human being.", "NTA don't let someone take the fall for something they didn't do", "I would 100% tell the dentist that you will be a witness and that you saw her being warned.  You would be the AH if you didn't regardless of your relationship with the dentist.", "NTA.  You are doing the right thing.", "NTA. She was warned and was willing to go ahead with the whole thing. If you don't care about losing her friendship and want to go through with it, go ahead.", "Wow.\n\n*'I have argued with her about it because* ***I witnessed him warning her but she says it's none of my business.'***\n\nYou're worried you might be TA? Just re-read that absolutely breathtaking statement above. You're definitely NTA. You were actually there when he explained the risks to her,  you're a material witness in a fraudulent potential case. \n\nYou'd be a huge A.H if you let an honest, innocent person have one moment of worry over this horrible situation, and an even bigger one if you listened to Jean. She's the AH in this situation. She'd be no loss to you as a friend, you're worth 100 of her. She's shown you her true colours. Believe her.\n\nContact your dentist, send your letter. It's the right thing to do.", "NTA.  Do it.  People (and attorneys) who just want a payout and will lue to get it, should not be rewarded for bad behavior.\n\nIf you dont, his insurance will likely settle to avoid court and minimize costs.  And his insurance premium will go up or be xanceled altogether, or he may just reitre and you lose a good dentist.", "NTA and dump the friend", "NTA. I'd do it too. I love my dentist. Went through a few who were awful in different ways until I found a awesome one.", "NTA. In fact, Y W B T A if you DON\u2019T testify in favor of the dentist. Fuck a lukewarm friendship, this is about an innocent man\u2019s livelihood.", "Advice the dentist you were witness to everything. Tell him you will give a sworn statement and/or testify in court.", "NTA I believe you are being very ethical and truthful to write a letter stating what you observed in the interactions between your friend and dentist. It will help in the potential defense definitely and also on a level perhaps reassure your dentist. Aside from that, most dentists have the patient sign an informed consent agreement for any treatment like root canal or extractions. So if he has that in the records there is in reality most likely no case if he did nothing negligent and practiced to the standard of care.  That being said any lawsuit against a professional even if it\u2019s a nuisance lawsuit is in extremely stressful and time-consuming. I wonder what your friend is looking for. Is it a refund of the fee or supposed damages. Please write the letter. I\u2019m a retired dentist and did have a nuisance lawsuit and it was hell having to defend myself. Luckily my records were impeccable and It was settled out of court with no admission of wrongdoing or negligence but again it was just hell anyway.", "If lawyer is only going on what Jean said he may think it is a good case.  Once he sees the records including the ones that Jean would have had to sign there should be disclosures of risk and the lawyer will not be so confident and there may not be any legal proceeding at all.  (In the US, patients have a right to their medical files and an attorney would want to see them before making a claim)  If the Dentist is your friend, tell him this, but maybe not in writing, that way if a claim is actually made, you would be a witness contacted by your Dentist Friend's attorney and have an obligation to tell the truth as opposed to volunteering it in writing before being asked and give Jean extra ammunition to think she is being persecuted.  So NTA, but I'd do it verbally.", "NTA if you heard it loud and clear she did too. Doesn\u2019t sound like someone you want as a friend.", "NTA. Do you really need/want that kind of friend?", "YWNBTA. She's lying and tarnishing his reputation. Since you know she's lying, because you were in the room, and can therefore back him up, you should.\n\nIn fact, YWBTA if you didn't defend him.", "NTA!", "If you actually witnessed him warning her, you are NTA. You just have to keep it to a neutral description of what you saw and heard. You do not need a liar as a friend. You could be next.", "You say you've already argued about this with her - was that a face to face conversation. Could you text/email her and try to get her response in a format you could provide as evidence?  Please do stick up for your dentist, Jean is abhorrent", "Husband is right. Lose the 'friend'. NTA", "NTA. If you were a witness to her being warned, which it sounds like you were, then you should tell him so his insurers can approach you for a witness statement. Be prepared to be asked exact dates and times, and they will ask if you are prepared to go to court and be cross examined by your friend's barrister", "NTA. She is attempting to discredit a professional whose entire livelihood depends on skill and reputation. She was given all information and chose to go against the dentist's recommended extraction regardless of the 50/50 outcome of her chosen treatment. She is trying to scam this dentist for services because she chose the wrong treatment. You absolutely should tell the truth to what you witnessed, and if that reflects poorly on your friend, then so be it - it's the truth. Perhaps the better question is, since you know she is lying and being vindictive, do you really want to be associated with a liar and schemer that would rather ruin a professional's life and ability to make a living, than admit she was wrong?", "NTA \nAnd that would be a very nice thing if you would testify against her. \nAnd you should definetly warn the dentist too", "NTA, send it. Regardless of this friendship, it's the right thing to do. Worst case you lose a friend who was just gonna find a reason to sue you one day", "Absolutely NTA!!", "YWNBTA, the only way you would is if you didnt say something", "NTA. She\u2019s a liar and a scammer. So yeah back up the dentist and ditch this person as a friend, they are not someone you want to have around.", "NTA - But don't write a statement.  Just contact the Dentist and remind if you were present for the appointment, and tell him you are willing to meet with his lawyer/insurance company representative go over what you witnessed.", "NTA! Good on you for wanting to do the right thing. I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with someone who can lie so freely and without guilt. Please help this poor dentist who was just doing his job!", "NTA. Here (Canada) dentists make you sign a form saying you\u2019re understanding the prices & you\u2019ve been told about the risks and chances of it working or not. Didn\u2019t she signed something like that?", "NTA, and as others have said, do it. This is not victimless. This is why dentist's insurance rates go up, and totally unfair.", "Nope, YWNBTA.\n\n\nIf your dentists are the same as the US then there was paperwork for her to sign and it usually covers the possibility that treatment is not a guarantee and that would help your dentist.\n\nA notarized affidavit from you reiterating what the dentist said at the initial appointment would not hurt him either. \n\nYour \"friend\" sounds like a total ass though", "NTA.\n\nGo ahead and call up the dentist and let him know you'll be a witness for him, and prove that your friend is lying. \n\nShe shouldn't be so confident in suing him when you were there and know she is lying. \n\n\nDon't let her get away with this.", "Call her lawyer and tell him exactly what you've said here. He's got ethical obligations not to misstate facts to the court. If he's pushy with you and says hes going to bring the claim anyway, remind him of his professional ethical obligations and tell him you will be providing a full statement regarding both the dentist's interaction with your friend and your call to her lawyer, and you will send it to the dentist, his lawyer, and the lawyers' regulatory body if necessary. Then stop hanging around with dishonest, scheming AH's.", "NTA. Do it. This \"Friend\" doesn't sound worth keeping around anyway.", "NTA she's lying and your dentist doesn't deserve her BS", "WNBTA. Don't let your 'friend' ruin this guy's life. He didn't do anything wrong. If it was reversed, you'd want him to back you up.", "NTA. Your friend is a scammer and not someone you need to be friends with. Thanks for standing up for the dentist and trying to do the right thing. The office likely won\u2019t treat you any different\u2026it\u2019s a crappy situation but they won\u2019t blame you.", "NTA. It is the truth and dentist does not deserve to deal with this nonsense.", "How will she and the lawyer argue that she wasn't fully informed about the odds of the treatment working when there was a witness to the conversation? You aren't relying on what you think he  might have said based on your previous interactions, you were present when the actual conversation took place.\n\nGo to your dentist and offer to give a statement. You might be subpoenaed by his lawyer as a witness in case this goes to trial anyway.", "NTA at all, she is talking about committing a legitimate crime here!\n\nYou absolutely should write that letter to your dentist. If nothing else, even if he does get sued and it doesn't go his way, you can know and he can know that you made an honest effort to address the situation, especially because you introduced Jean to your dentist.", "Nta. You need to give a written statement and offer to be a witness for the dentist if it goes to court. Please keep us updated.", "NTA, do it! A lawsuit does damage in the long run. Help clear his name. It sucks you will likely lose a friend, but I think she just a money greedy friend who want to be paid for her bad decision.", "NTA. It\u2019ll be a professional hit for the dentist, and it sounds like this is also insurance fraud?", "NTA Jean sounds like a damned nightmare.\n\nI'd rather lose this vulture than lose a good dentist.", "NTA. If the dentist had her sign an agreement, informed consent with the specified risks and benefits or at least documents what was discussed, then her argument won\u2019t likely work anyways. However, your written statement would carry a lot of weight since you were a witness to the conversation.", "I would send the letter and not worry about her because honestly she doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend to begin with! She is putting you in such an awkward situation and I understand you feeling the way you do since you referred her. You tried to talk some sense into her and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve brought up the fact that if this does go to court and you\u2019re called as a witness you will state the truth and maybe that would deter but again you shouldn\u2019t have to go through all of this because she shouldn\u2019t be doing this to begin with. Her acting as if this doesn\u2019t affect him because he has insurance is such a BS excuse and says a lot about her character especially since she considers you a friend and you referred her. Do what you feel is right to get this off your chest as much as possible because remember you can\u2019t control her. Sorry you and your dentist are having to deal with this and hopefully she comes to her senses soon but from what it sounds like I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath :/ 100% NTA", "NTA, but friendship would be over", "NTA- you don\u2019t need liars and scammers as friends.", "NTA.  I really hope he would have had her sign a waiver before proceeding.", "Not only a written statement, but if it goes to court, OP should agree to appear in person.\n\nI'm an attorney, and this sux on so many levels.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I hope your dentist implements this warning in writing for future patients. It is standard practice in the US for a dentist to require written consent, acknowledging these very same warnings, before treatment. Of course, there are probably also more scammers here.", "Or his insurance could drop him\n\nI agree OP is TA, but it\u2019s mind-boggling to me that the dentist didn\u2019t make the friend sign paperwork acknowledging that she\u2019d been warned", "Plus her and her lawyer are acting like it's an easy payout. Forgetting that op was there and the dentist lawyer could supeona her as a witness that he gave her ample warning.

There's usually a proposed treatment plan that get's signed off ahead of work being carried out.

Can you elaborate on this?", "Exactly! Very well put. It's not just about the money but the feeling of being wronged when you were not wrong will have its effect on him and he doesn't deserve it.", "For that matter, not sure how this works in the UK (assuming based on currency), but in the relatively similar US legal system, the dentist could just subpoena OP and compel her to testify under oath (at a deposition or in court) about what she saw and heard\u2026 whether she wants to or not.\n\nGiving the lawyer a heads up may be helpful, though, in getting her out of testifying, if it would allow the dentist\u2019s legal team to convince the ex-friend to just drop the case.", "Putting it in writing likely still helps. As time passes people forget details, the earlier you commit events to paper the better.", "Odds are friend remembers but thinks she is the main character and what she says goes.", "And he could fire OP as a patient.", "It\u2019s also a bit weird to me that they aren\u2019t close friends, and yet Jean is the one that reached out to her?\n\nI have a dental fear. Take Ativan to help, my husband must be touching me at all times during the appointments (he sits in by my legs usually). And this is with really great dentist and hygienists. If I didn\u2019t have my husband and needed someone there, it\u2019s a close friend I would be reaching out to, not someone I wasn\u2019t that close to. \n\nEither she is a bit of a scammer and had this idea in the back of her mind the whole time, or she pulls shit a lot and doesn\u2019t have close friends. \n\nDitch the friend, keep the dentist, sounds like he\u2019s a good one.", "It's also OP's business because the dentist could make OP testify as they were present during the appointment.\n\nDid she not tell her lawyer there was a witness to the warning and explanation?", "Your reply is on the cusp-id of brilliance.", "No good lawyer just takes the word of their client and doesn't ask if they signed anything.

Either Jean is exaggerating or the lawyer is slimy.", "If I was in your position, I would be ok with losing this friend for those reasons you stated.", "Most likely not, since the lawyer only knows what their client told them. And it sounds to me like that information wasn't shared with the lawyer. \n\nWhich is why I think OP shouldn't write a letter, but rather set the time aside to go to court with the dentist as a witness.", "Or she lied to her lawyer. Which is the most likely scenario.", "Lawyer: \u201cdid you sign anything?\u201d\n\n\nClient: \u201cno.\u201d", "According to Jean, the dentist said the root and crown treatment would work.
