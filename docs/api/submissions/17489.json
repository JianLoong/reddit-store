I bet it was the same people who caused us to lose the fridge privileges too by not closing the goddamn door and breaking the fridge.", "This is such a sensible comment.\n\nThe person dropping off the papers could also throw on a mask for the 10 seconds they are in the tuna office.", "Grow up", "Sounds delicious.

There are lower fat mayos (I like miracle whip personally, or the light version) or add lots of relish and mustard to the Greek yogurt to loosen it up. \n\nIf you have an empty jar and like me, struggle to find smaller Greek yogurt containers in a plain version, mix your \u201cdressing\u201d in bulk and jar it. That way you don\u2019t have an open thing of Greek yogurt drying out. Press Saran or plastic wrap down to the surface before adding the jar lid to help keep scents from the fridge out and reduce air contact, helping it stay fresher.

You sure have been eating a lot of tuna lately...\"\n\nI'd readily eat the same thing everyday and it would be unrelated to health. It'd be: I want lunch, I like this, I have time to prepare this, it's simple.\n\nThere's no obvious about it...

Besides cold tuna literally doesn't smell unless it's right next to your nose", "I will say, it can get really awful if it's in a super confined space. I work outdoors, and my coworkers and I will all eat in the car together when we get the chance. One of my coworkers will consistently eat tuna sandwiches (which he carries around in his pack, in the sun, all day) and he will eat them in the cars. He also never cracks a window.\n\nHowever, I don't complain, because I can deal with the smell for a while, and I can always crack a window open if I really have to. If I can handle my coworker eating hot tuna in a small car, I think people can handle a coworker eating a cold tuna sandwich in the break room.", "Thank you for this.

You ever had turkey or dressing or green beans that were just yeast-flavored? Worst Thanksgiving dinner ever. Worse than the years with family drama, worse than the one when my wife didn't feel good and turned out (per the Thanksgiving Day urgent care visit) she had walking pneumonia in both lungs.

Definitely got racist vibes from that.", "To me, hard boiled eggs smell so so bad, and very strong, even cold. Unless I am eating them, in which case they are 100% delicious :)\n\nFucking love egg sandwiches, but I only eat them in public if I'm like making them for everyone for a road trip or something.\n\nOtherwise I'll eat outside.
