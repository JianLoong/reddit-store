I\u2019ve turned to fish as a main source of food, and canned tuna is one thing I enjoy a lot. I have started taking tuna salad to work with me every so often.  When I take it to work I prepare it before hand, so I\u2019m not opening the can at work or anything, just eating it out of Tupperware. \n\n\nOne of the newer employees at my work confronted me recently for bringing the tuna salad to work because she can smell it when she enters my office apparently. To be clear the smell doesn\u2019t waft into the public spaces, but when she\u2019s dropping off papers or telling me something she can smell it. I explained to her my diet changed and apologized for the smell but told her I wouldn\u2019t be changing my diet again right now as my stomach has a hard time adjusting to new food routines and this one has finally started working. She got pretty upset and told me that it was common office sense not to bring fish. I thought that that rule was always about microwaving seafood, not just bringing tuna salad which i feel like is a pretty common lunch food. I feel bad that she doesn\u2019t like the smell but I really just need to keep with my routine.

So no, I wouldn't enter that office at any point that smell is present.", "I call it Single man food lol", "Makes sense!", "Yea, tuna salad is a super strong smell. I think it's worse than microwaved fish.\n\n\nBut if it's your own personal office with the door closed, it's fine. It's your lunch break anyway, so you shouldn't be bothered with work stuff.

I do close my door during lunch I like to have a little privacy", "Put a sarcastic sign on the door when you are eating, like a Charlie Tuna meme.
