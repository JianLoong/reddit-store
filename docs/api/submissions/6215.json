He\u2019s always been incredibly sarcastic and a jerk but it always came down to that just being his personality. To be fair I\u2019ve made some sarcastic comments in return over the years but that was the tone of our relationship.\nAs I\u2019m now in my mid twenties I\u2019ve grown less and less fond of being the younger sister that\u2019s the butt of jokes. I don\u2019t mind teasing but he began moreso just making remarks about me being dumb in front of people. Not terrible I know but is very upsetting to me and a big insecurity. I will subtly stick up for myself but I don\u2019t say much. It\u2019s awkward.\nThere were also instances where I would call my sister to vent about my anxiety (sometimes crying) and he would mock me in the background. I\u2019m assuming he must just think I\u2019m annoying ?? \nAnyway onto the main event that happened at a family birthday party. We had just eaten and I was standing with a handheld mirror and reapplying lip liner. My BIL walks by me and slaps my elbow, making me hit myself in the mouth and drop it. It was annoying but also hurt a little. I told him \u201cdon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d I know he was just trying to embarrass me in front of everyone but I\u2019m a grown woman and I don\u2019t understand why he would think that\u2019s okay. If we were closer and actually had the foundations of a friendly relationship then maybe I would\u2019ve laughed it off but it\u2019s annoying regardless. Even my boyfriend doing that to me would piss me off. \nI could tell he was mad because he just walked away without a word. My sister starts laughing and asking if I\u2019m serious and when I said yes she instantly got defensive of him and asked why I was being such a bitch. I tried sticking up for myself but she was saying \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d And making me the bad guy so I just decided it was time to leave. When I was leaving she stopped me again and was again asking why I was being a bitch and I told her that he\u2019s never been nice to me and I\u2019m sick of dealing with it. She acted like she had no clue what I was talking about and it didn\u2019t end well. My boyfriend and I got in my car and I sobbed because my sister has never talked like that to me before.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA??? How should I have handled this differently?\n\nTLDR; my sisters husband has always picked on me and I finally snapped at him at a family function.", "created_utc": 1672588871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100mkjk/aita_for_finally_snapping_at_my_bil/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL's behaviour doesn't require them because they are almost universally socially unacceptable.  \n\nMocking you?  Calling you dumb?  Hitting your elbow while you are putting on makeup?  If there was no other context, I'd think I was reading a story about a high school bully.  \n\nYour BIL is a jerk.  Plain and simple.  And your sister is a jerk for defending him. \n\nMaybe it's time to be really clear about your physical boundaries and go NC with them.  They're toxic and you shouldn't have to be subjected to your BIL's bullying.\n\nWhy do families have to suck so much?", "NTA. Even if you were on better terms in sure you wouldn't have appreciated his behavior. You have every right to tell him not to touch you and voice some clear boundaries. Your sister needs to respect that.", "NTA your BIL is a jerk and so is your sister.", "NTA. BIL either really has it out for you or almost a weird middle school \u201cI have to be mean to her.\u201d type crush he needs to come to terms with, SIL was out of line too.", "NTA\n\nHe has overstepped boundaries. You need to be very clear now though. You will no longer tolerate any abusive \u2018jokes\u2019 or behaviours that make you feel uncomfortable from BIL.", "NTA. Your BIL is a dick and he knows it. I don't think you can really rely on your sister either. She clearly gives him ammo to work with and doesn't care to shut it down. I would go LC/NC with both of them.", "NTA and carry pepper spray around for the next time he touches you. I'm sorry your sister and family aren't backing you up.", "NTA. He\u2019s wrong and your sister is blind about it", "NTA, your BIL should be the one embarassed and your sister and family enable his barbaric behavior. I am sorry your having to deal with this.  Your sister is something else, classic blame the victim for the abusers behavior and calling the victim out for reacting.", "Yeah NTA - don\u2019t take his shit. Bullies hate to be called out. He perhaps has a weird obsession for you. Continue to set your boundaries. It\u2019s 2023 we are calling out inappropriate behaviors no matter how small or big.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s a bully. \n\nBIL is obviously used to treating people with disrespect. I wonder how he treats your sister in private.  That could impact her ability to defend you.", "So NTA! Your BIL sounds like a real jerk. As an aside, when I was dating my SO, I told him that when I\u2019m applying make up, do not come within 3 feet of me. We\u2019ve been together 24 years, and he has honored this request, he understands why (eye liner or mascara wand in the eye).", "I only ever see them a few times a year anyway and he won\u2019t even look at me at this point. Which is fine with me I guess lol just so uncomfortable. My sister and I are okay now sorta but I definitely feel awkward about it", "My mom also compared it to an elementary school crush and that is so beyond yuck to me \ud83e\udd74 certainly hope that\u2019s not the case.", "I agree and I do feel bad that I didn\u2019t say anything in the past. I didn\u2019t ever want to seem confrontational but I guess that bit me in the ass lmao", "If I were to guess she must get defensive on his behalf because it\u2019s embarrassing. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t want him mad at her if she sided with me. She\u2019s a really great sister in every other way but her loyalty is with him and I know that now. Regardless she \u201ctalked to him\u201d and he doesn\u2019t acknowledge me anymore.", "Bullying, mocking, and physical targeting are never okay. You don\u2019t have to set boundaries for those; they are implied just by being alive. OP is NTA.", "Understandable that you feel awkward, but just know it's not on you.  The next time you see them just do your thing and pretend that your BIL is a mature adult who won't be repeating his actions.  In other words, act completely un-phased.  If he bullies you at all just give him a puzzled look and say in completely matter-of-fact tone: \"I thought you understood that your behaviour makes me uncomfortable?\"  Then excuse yourself and simply leave (to another conversation or room).  Bullies NEED an emotional response.  So don't give him one.  He'll either leave you alone or keep trying to get a response from you.  If he keeps at it, leave the gathering with a smile but no excuse.  Bonus points if others witness the interactions.  Eventually others will get tired of him ruining family gatherings.\n\nI know all of this seems like easy advice for me to give.  But I learned a long time ago that certain members of my family are what they are.  There's not a damn thing I can do to change them.  So I took the higher ground when around them and didn't feel obligated to participate if I wasn't in the mood to have my day ruined.  Eventually I was at an event where the family member was not there.  And the atmosphere was distinctly lighter and more enjoyable for everyone.  That was a turning point because everyone present realized the common denominator who was not there.  And others began to get annoyed at events when the family member was there and behaving like an ass.   They began to tell the person to knock it off.  Now when that family member's name is spoken it's most often accompanied by a sigh or an eyeroll.", "See the thing is that no one in my family has validated my feelings apart from my mother. Everyone just kind of ignored it and it\u2019s not that I need them to stick up for me but it stings a little. I have a history of being the \u201cemotional baby sister\u201d which mostly stems from my anxiety disorder. I worry that my family will look at me as the problem for acknowledging something they all ignore. \n\nMy sister and I exchanged texts after this all happened and she accused me of just being angry at men and \u201cgoing through something\u201d. Like why am I not allowed to just have boundaries???", "NTA its super clear he\u2019s aware he\u2019s being a dick and is used to not being challenged on it, so he continues as it amuses him. Nobody should have to put up with that!", "NTA.\n\nI don't care if it's a couple times a year.  Go full NC.  Tell your sister it's because she's calling you a bitch and her husband is an asshole and she let's this bullshit happen.  Then congratulate her for finding her perfect match - a bitch and an asshole deserve each other.  Hang up, block her on everything, and any family that wants to complain about what you did ask them \"Oh, so I can hit your elbow whenever I want? I can call you a bitch and you won't say anything? Just like how they expected me to react to such treatment? Really??\" And then tell them you thought so and to mind their shit, shut up, and back off or you'll cut them out too.", "NTA. I'm actually getting major creep vibes from your BIL.", "NTA - the BIL is an abusive coward that probably has never been challenged on his behavior. Your sister's response makes me think she's blind to it (maybe she's too used to being treated like that herself, and expects it?) Every time he acts up, immediately cut him short. Tell him you're tired on his childish antics. If he lays hands on you again, report it. Bullies always say it's just a joke when they are confronted. Unwelcome physical touch, especially if forceful? That's assault.", "NTA, not even close to being at fault. He was a dick and you finally had enough and called him out on it. You're allowed boundaries.", "Or a sweet nudge with your knee to his groin. 'Sorry, that was literally a kneejerk reaction to a man touching me violently without my permission.'", "You absolutely are! It's just easier for them to fall back on a tired old dynamic where you're \"too emotional\" rather than think critically about their own behavior.", "Because it's easier for people to ignore shit than it is to acknowledge it and therefore have to clean it up. Especially when they are not the ones directly affected.  It's no excuse and it sucks but it's true.\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to have boundaries.  And you need to set them.  Which may include hard decisions like having minimal contact with your family if your brother in law will be there.  Just because you have boundaries doesn't mean that others have to respect them. In a perfect world, we all would.  \n\nYou have set your own boundaries and be prepared to do what it takes to maintain them - if you won't, why would anyone else?  \n\nNurture and cherish your relationship with your mother.  It sounds like she's your person.", "You are perfectly entitled to be angry at a guy who thinks it is ok to physically, mentally, and emotionally hurt you, and what you are going through is being unwilling to put up with his BS any longer.", "NTA - no one has the right to touch you without your permission, implied (like with your boyfriend with pre-evolved boundaries) or explicit. You were very clear.", "NTA. Tell them both that you are sorry that he has Zero redeeming qualities and can only try to score point by being a complete jerk to you with childish jokes and insults, but you are Done with being his punching bag. \n\nIt\u2019s time for him to grow the f up, and if he cannot respect your person then you will no longer suffer his presence nor anyone who thinks that being a bully is in any way excusable.", "You bil is an irritating immature ass who needed to be called out, well done you for finally doing it. Your sister is an ah for not privately telling him to stop his immature annoying behaviour  years ago. Stop beating yourself up over this, he doesn't deserve the head space and you were right.", "NTA. Your BIL is a bully and your sister not only enables him but upbraids you for not accepting his abusive behaviour. \n\nI would go no contact with them and anyone else who enables them.", "NTA at all!!! Just because your sister puts up with that jerk doesn\u2019t mean you have to. Grow your voice my dear, stand up for yourself any time you\u2019re being disrespected. We teach people how to treat us by what we say and don\u2019t say. I was a huge people pleaser back in the day and got walked on like a rug. Finally I unleashed my mouth and it changed my life.", "NTA. if you smacked him and made him drop something, i doubt he\u2019d find it funny", "Or she is abused too.", "Send her this thread", "You need to send this post to her to read so she can understand how her husband is a bully", "Definitely crossed my mind too. Either that or he is a bully. You were an easy mark when you were young and he continues it.", "It's likely not the case. He sees you as weak prey so he is trying to predate you. That's it. Whatever reason he has doesn't matter, the fact is he will continue, and will continue escalating, to achieve that. You need to hold your ground and call him out every time.\n\nNTA.", "Yup, could most possibly it\u2019s part of it.", "Or she's just an asshole enabler.", "Tell her you are fine with men who don't bully people and respect boundaries.", "it sounds like they have weaponized your youth against you and have gaslit you into thinking everything is your own doing. \n\nYour BIL hit you, and when you snapped, you are seen as the perpetrator. Your BiL is still angry at your defending yourself against a physical assault.", "You are allowed to just have boundaries! And that \"overly emotional\" crap is a BS line that people pull when they don't want someone to rock the boat, or want to dismiss perfectly reasonable reactions from women. Your BIL is an ass."]}
