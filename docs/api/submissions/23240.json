My mum is incredibly kind, generous and caring person. She had a pretty challenging (to put it incredibly mildly) upbringing and took on a carer role from a young age which I feel may have distorted her ability to call out her sibling (i can empathise that this of course has likely had influence on my aunt also). She always comments that she's just 'grateful' to have a family, and takes on everybody's stress and never complains. I know if I do this my mum will bear the brunt of their antics which is a worry. \n\n\nWhen they've done this in the past my siblings and I have been incredibly assertive and direct with them (with some added flowery language) but it always just amplifies their behaviour even more leaving my mum to deal with it.

I can defintely see how it come across that way from my post. In terms of not being honest...I like to think I am, I'm just not fully settled on what my thoughts are. We know for a fact that my partner has made the decision to not to invite any children on his side. My family, would like an exception on mine given that there are only 2 kids and it's 'not a lot' (both K's). That's when my feelings I suppose came into play , because I don't see why I would make an exception for K (given her history and that his family will not be getting the same 'exception').

That doesn't mean I'm asking for accommodations. It means don't act surprised or like an AH if I can't make it. So many people ask for child free weddings then get upset that certain friends and family won't make it due to the child free restrictions. As long as you understand that your child free request may come at the expense of friends and family attending who have children, especially children under 5 or have special needs then it's a great choice to make. I don't fault anyone for wanting a child free wedding but so many people who make that request then get upset when their friends and family with children under 5 can't make it. If you want friends or family who have young children to make a child free wedding, then provide accommodations for those kids to be in the area. \n\nI find it crazy how many people demand friends and family with young children do something child free for hours on end, and get upset when that can't be accommodated in a way that allows those friends and family to attend. I understand not wanting children in the picture for a special event, but people need to understand that I'm accommodating that by not attending that special event. \n\nI think it's a lack of understand the codependency of young children and their parents.

All anyone said was that if you choose to make a wedding child free some people with children will likely decide not to go, so you have to be aware of that consequence. And we see a good number of posts where someone gets pissed that people said they won\u2019t go to their child-free wedding, so it\u2019s clearly advice that\u2019s needed.", "Sorry, what does LC/NC mean?", "Exactly. \n\nOne of my best friends and her husband did a child free wedding in Mexico. Her niece and nephew couldn\u2019t be there, which was her only minor regret.\n\nWe enjoyed it so much, we\u2019re discussing doing ours child free.

If your intent was to have a child free wedding regardless, ill change it to nta. \n\nBut good for your reflection and acknowledging the wording isn't quite right.

Placating them enables their horrific behaviour and you never want to see another repeat of grannies funeral as long as you live because of how vile they were. You will not tolerate it on the happiest day of your life and you know it will happen.

My own sister didn\u2019t come to my CF wedding since she could not secure a sitter. In this case it really is about the bride and groom and not about the guest with children.

Im just now getting my wife over the doormat phase. Shes the eldest in a latina family so theres a lot of bullshit thrown at her. Now shes drawing a line, shes gotten so much time for herself and to grow. The woman i married has evolved into someone even more incredible because she has been saying NO to the bullshit heaped on her by others.", "yeah. based on this, K will make a scene at your wedding regardless of whether their children are there or not. Uninvite her, invest in security, they will try to get in.", "We planned a child-free wedding a few years ago. We planned a weeklong trip to Italy with 40 close friends and family members, [where we'd be renting out this entire villa, and we had excursions planned for each day like vineyard tours and wine tastings, meals, and more](https://imgur.com/a/lbVL53f). And on one of the days, [we'd have our ceremony at this 16th-century ghetto synagogue](https://imgur.com/a/S3f6UZW). And on another, we'd have a big party with dancing, live music, a DJ, etc. The idea was to make it like a big vacation with different people we hold dear, with bits of our wedding spread throughout the week so we could all really savor and enjoy it.\n\nSome of our friends have a couple of young kids, as does my brother. We knew it might be a lot asking them to find childcare for a week, so for those with kids we called and spoke with them directly. Our friends were thrilled at the chance to get away from their kids and have a vacation with us. My brother has very active boys and after explaining how all of the excursions would be adult-oriented, and would likely include some late nights out, having the kids there would just create more of a distraction and keep them away from enjoying their time with us. In seeing what the overall plan was, he totally understood.\n\nI would suggest calling and speaking with K (and anyone else with kids) directly and telling them that you're wedding will be child-free and why. Come up with a couple of reasonable explanations - kids struggle to stay put and just want to have fun, sitting through a ceremony and then a large group dinner will not be fun for them, and they'll probably need quiet distractions like coloring books or handheld games to keep them entertained and settled at which point why does it matter if they're there since they're not enjoying themselves. Plus it means the parents won't really be able to enjoy themselves as they'll be more consumed with watching their kids, and probably having to call it an early night. Also, the food may not be child-friendly and most likely children aren't going to like the same food as your adult guests. And if you're looking to have a fun time with an open bar and dancing and all that, why would you want kids there? You wouldn't bring them with you if you're going out to a bar or party. \n\nK does seem a bit unreasonable though, perhaps you can talk to her husband? Or you may have to make up a lie like the venue doesn't allow children since it's serving alcohol or something. I'm not sure how close you all are or how many aunts, uncles, and cousins you have, but if it's only two cousins and an aunt maybe don't invite any of them?", "Ha. Tell her it's a full Mass wedding!", "We had a very tiny ceremony and the reception is what the rest of the family was invited to -- that's when they brought their kids. It made me glad that we decided to keep the ceremony just immediate family and close friends.", ">> If the wedding is out of town it\u2019s a big ask to have someone with kids go without them.\n\n> a big ask? LOL - that\u2019s entitlement.\n\nYes, but... If you invite someone to your child free wedding and they can't make it because they are unable to get care for their children\n\n- If they get mad at you because they can't come, then that's entitlement by them. You have every right to make your wedding child-free.\n- If you get mad at them because they can't come, then that's entitlement by them. You made the choice to have your wedding child-free, and that comes with consequences; sometimes people you want to be there... can't.\n- If nobody gets mad at anyone, because nobody did anything wrong.. then there's no entitlement.", "> it\u2019s absolutely NOT a responsibility of the people getting married to be concerned with someone else\u2019s child care needs.\n\nSure, but if you want a certain person at your wedding, and then make it unfeasible for them to attend, you don't have the right to get mad about it when they can't come.\n\nFinding reliable childcare isn't easy for everyone. If you have an army of friends and family willing to step in and help at a moment's notice, that's awesome, but the reality is not every parent has that, and sometimes it means they will have to miss out on special events so they can attend to their responsibilities as parents.\n\nIn this case, though, OP doesn't want K to attend. She should probably just not invite her, since (1) the fam's gonna flip out either way, (2) banning the kids isn't a solid guarantee K won't come.", "Okay\u2026. But it isn\u2019t \u201centitled\u201d to say \u201cno\u201d to a wedding invite if you can\u2019t find childcare for your kids. That\u2019s just parenting. I\u2019m going to pick my kids over a wedding, every time.", "I agree, saying no is not entitled. However saying \u201c that\u2019s a big ask\u201d is - or it comes from a place of knee jerk entitlement.\n\ntrust me, I get it. Parenting is hard and it comes with a lot of sacrifices. But the onus of childcare issues is the parents & no one else.", "Anywhere you have to spend the night is a 'destination wedding.'  If it's not a day trip, it's a 'destination wedding.'\n\nYes, this means that for some guests, any given wedding may or may not be a 'destination' wedding.  For Uncle Bob, it's an hour drive, great.  But for Uncle John, he has to fly in from Cali?  It's a destination wedding.", "This.\n\nI'll add my personal two cents that while I think it's within people's rights, it's often a bad look. Some of the people who want to celebrate you have children. Making your wedding a PITA for them is ugly.", "a destination wedding is a DESTINATION for the wedding party - like the Caribbean\n\na wedding is generally always out of town for guests, but that\u2019s NOT a \u201cdestination wedding\u201d & it never will be, no matter how much you wish it", "What the actual fuck are you smoking bro? Who and how did you come to this conclusion of murdering people at a wedding? Are you that stupid?", "\u201cOther people want something different\u201d then why get married in the first place people love to take the custom then shit on it because \u201cdifferent\u201d no you want to bastardize it then we will be hearing about the divorce 5 years from now.", "That's fine but the question was if she'd be the ah for having a child free wedding because she doesn't like K. Hope this helps.", "\"A big ask\" just means it's hard. It doesn't mean the person is asking to be accommodated by the people getting married.\n\nAnd what this entails for parents is hard, giving them plenty of fair reason not to share in the day. As long as the people throwing the wedding understand this is a considerable limitation and don't have hard feelings, I think everyone is good.", "no, saying its a \u201cbig ask\u201d is putting the onus on the person who is having the event or want to have an event.\n\nPeople are allowed to have child free weddings/events. And those who get irked because \u201cresponsibilities get in the way\u201d need to check their entitlement & lack of accountability for their own choices at the door.", "Wine wankers!", "\u201cOut of town\u201d can mean an overnight stay. And some people can\u2019t do that. Kids may be young or there might be issues relating to disability/ND or whatever.", "Lol it wasn't that big a deal, Becky.", "He is saying you can do your wedding how you want and that\u2019s the right way. But that\u2019s false, because you can do bad things according to the parameters this person has set", "You seem a bit self-absorbed.", "seriously. neither K nor her kids should be there. she sounds like a nightmare. it sucks that your mom might be subjected to shit from K's mom, but this is YOUR wedding.

NTA", "Yes, very. I wanted to wait and have a 'wedding' later on, so we would have more time to plan. See, my fiance had just finished boot camp and we were going to do the courthouse thing, and have something later when, idk, my sister could be there (she lived 18hrs away). \nHis parents and sisters pressured us to put together a wedding in a hurry and with very little money, I wore a salvation army dress, it was a pot luck, and my uncle (who I did not invite) brought his birthday cake.\n\nMaybe we'll do something nice for our 15yr anniversary next year \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I didn't find it rude, just an interesting take which I feel warranted a response\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0a I know its definitely triggering when you're watching a loved one kind of take on that crap. I'm glad to hear that about your wife that she's managed to establish those boundaries\ud83d\udc4d", "Pretty likely \ud83d\ude02 a sibling recently got married and they caused a lot of tension there as well.", "My granny prior to my siblings wedding was incredibly frail.\n\nMy mother took on a lot of grannies care, running a clinic and driving an hour away to look after her and sleep over in her house each evening. She was completely exhausted & probably needed respite but from a medical perspective, could see that my granny was likely to deteriorate at any time and wanted to be there as much as possible.\n\nA decision was made by my sibling and mother that inviting my grandmother would be almost be cruel given her care needs and ability to quickly exhaust (they're both health professionals so was mostly influenced by their expertise). \n\nThey discussed this with my granny who agreed, and decided to hold a small tea party at her house the day before to still do something special for her and keep her included. \n\nThat's when my aunt & cousin became involved and began harassing my mother & sibling. Basically writing that she 'wasn't even Sick' and insinuating that my mother was horrible for not bringing her. Despite them never visiting her themselves and at times encouraging her to not go to certain appointments etc.\n\nMy sister told them that we obviously would have loved our granny to be there (particularly as we had a far closer relationship to her) but the decision was influenced by all of our joint medical expertise. She also told them that mum had 'mother of the bride' duties and wouldn't be able to properly mind granny as well however even though we didn't recommend it, \nthey were free to as my mum had done for them at their weddings.\n\nThey declined as minding her would be \"too much\" for them and \"ruin\" their night. \nRegardless they still held on to the idea that granny 'wasn't even sick'. A week after the wedding my grandmother passed, and they maybe finally understood what my mum meant but never acknowledged their behaviour.", "We bought and filed one of these for a party\u2026.It wasn\u2019t enough.", "Edit: I see what you are saying. In my head, \"a big ask\" is synonymous with \"it requires a lot.\" Traveling without kids requires a lot of parents.", "I'm sorry I failed you,", "You have two hands", "Touch\u00e9, we ran out of bottles eventually\u2026.", "Ok chief.", "Update: \n\nThank you for everybody in the comments  for showing empathy and equally to those respectfully challenged my thought process and gave me something to reflect on. I've had a good look through both takes and have come to the following conclusion about what I plan to do next: \n\n1) My partner and I will continue with our plan to have no children at the event (under 16 yrs) at the event and will not be making exceptions, REGARDLESS of what behaviour it may result it. Done some calculations since the post and have come to the inclusion that this decision will also save us roughly \u20ac2600 and means we will not have to cut out some friends to keep with the venues guest limit. The only exception we will make to this is if our own siblings happen to have a child before the wedding. \n\n2) Although a lot of partners family have already expressed that they themselves do not want to bring their kids, this will likely not suit everybody. It's on us as hosts to communicate to those that may not attend for this reason (which is fair) that although we will miss their presence there is absolutely no expectation on our part. If we are making this choice WE need to take on that some may not attend.\n\n3)and of course K. A lot of you asked why was her at all and a few think it's on me for not just being direct. And honestly, you're all probably right in different ways - I was concerned that my thoughts about K were too emotive and clouded, as the funeral incident is still quite recent and fresh for me. Those of you essentially pointed out that I need to 'balls up' are right, part of this is on me for not more direct and assertive. Reading your comments has been incredibly helpful and given me conviction to call it how it is- she shouldn't be there.\n\nIf she acts up I will try to ignore, if she continues I will point out that she excluded people in hers and didn't bat an eyelid doing so (a family member, her side not mine,  who K labelled a wh*re for escaping and separating from an extremely violent partner).", "Thats a good point. I think we should contact those that do have kids directly as suggested, just so they know our thinking and there is no assumption on our part. \n\nAs for the alcohol bit, good suggestion but I know that aunt and cousin would 100% ring up venue to interrogate staff on that \ud83d\ude02 and if the staff lied on my behalf, they'd probably be the type to go contact the ombudsman or call into a radio to publicly bash the venue (I wish I was joking \ud83d\ude02)", "She took down pictures of the deceased at her own wake to replace with pictures of her kids? Jesus what a piece of work."]}
