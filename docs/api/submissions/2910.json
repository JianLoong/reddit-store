I (29f) am getting married this December and it\u2019s going to be a family affair (we have a large family, roughly 100 guests). Ive sent invites to pretty much everyone and their partners but not my uncle\u2019s partner.\n\nThe reason for this is because my uncle\u2019s relationships don\u2019t last all that long (the longest was 5 years from memory) and more importantly his partners are always quite young. For instance, my uncle is 53 and his current boyfriend is 18.\n\nSo, clearly, I don\u2019t want that at my wedding. It\u2019s nothing against their sexuality or the relationship, it\u2019s got more to do with the fact that the relationship isn\u2019t really a genuine one and will end in a few years at most. Plus, I don\u2019t want to have pictures in my wedding album of a random teenager my uncle was having relations with for a few months. It\u2019s supposed to be a special occasion to share with family.\n\nThe only real reason I\u2019m on here is because my uncle and some others in my family are furious at my decision and are threatening to boycott my wedding if I don\u2019t allow my uncle his plus one.\n\nSo am I an asshole here or is my point of view valid?", "created_utc": 1669071528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1d5qk/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_uncles_boyfriend/", "score": 570, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He won\u2019t even be old enough to drink at your wedding- HES 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU- and your family is okay with this??? NTA\n\nedit: OP i saw your response to my post saying the kid JUST graduated and your Uncle was a plus one to his ceremony, that\u2019s not okay. If you allow this kid to your wedding, you\u2019re basically saying \u201chey uncle i\u2019m totally fine with you dating/(edit)GROOMING high schoolers\u201d", "Can you make the wedding 21 years old and up?\n\nNTA", "Eh... probably going to be downvoted, but NTA. First, your wedding, your rules. Second, yeah, you are right, explaining to the people not in the know how your 53 y.o. uncle grooms teenagers is awkward AF. Yep, totally understand how you'd be wary of his relationship.", "Gonna go against the grain.\n\nNTA, your uncle has essentially groomed a teenager. He's comfortably old enough to be that boys father. It's weird.\n\nHe's old enough to be his father. \n\nHonestly, if you dont want that uncle st your wedding, don't invite him full stop.", "NTA simply because that age gap is scary. He seems to be grooming and I wouldn't want that at my wedding either.", "INFO: How long have they been together?", "NTA. I tend to care about age gaps far less than most people, but it\u2019s my firm belief that anybody significantly over 25 dating somebody younger than 25 is a creep. Ngl, I think I wouldn\u2019t invite the uncle if I was in your place. That\u2019s a serious red flag.", "This is going to be a good one", "NTA. On every single one of these I\u2019ve seen where the man is consistently getting girlfriends who are only just legal and dumping girlfriends when they get past the point where there age gap would be creepy, judgement has been NTA. Here it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t judge your uncles lifestyle\u201d?? I mean of course you don\u2019t want one of many of your 53 year old uncles teenage lovers in your wedding pictures wtf", "Ew...ew... EW.\n\nYeah, I literally do not care about anything else: your uncle is grooming that kid.\n\nEw.", "NTA because, for me, it comes down to your wedding, you're allowed to invite who you want (same as people that have child-free weddings). And I think the age gap (and potential overlap depending on how long they have been dating and if the bf was a minor at the time) could make me uncomfortable too. \n\nBut keep in mind, married people can also get a divorce, so \"I don't want someone that might not be in the family down the road in the pictures\" isn't really a good reason. Not only that, but you need to figure out if this is worth potentially permanently damaging your relationship with certain members of your family.\n\nGood luck.", "I was going to say Y T A but 18 with a 50 something, yeah no. That's gross and going to be short lived, I don't blame you. Why have a random teenager at your wedding because your uncle is living out a daddy kink?\n\nSorry edit to add NTA\nAnd don't listen to all the Y T A people.", "I think it's ok to boycott someone for their sexuality when their \"sexual preference\" is kids.\n\nAs a gay person, I'm real tired of being lumped in with these predators. NTA.", "NTA for not wanting a stranger who most likely won\u2019t be in your life long at all to attend your wedding. And no matter the gender makeup, a 53 year-old dating an 18 year-old will be a spectacle, and when people talk about your wedding in the future they\u2019ll remember your creepy uncle and the teenager he was banging.", "Nta\n\nYour uncle is a creep for dating a barely adult, it doesnt matter the sexuality but their age...", "Nta for your pov.  But curiosity - how long does a relationship have to be to be official?  Five years wasn't, obviously.  How long have you and your fiance been together?  Hope it's more than five years to be 'official'.  Just don't have him in pictures if it bugs you that much.", "NTA- if my 53 year old uncle was dating an 18 year old girl or boy i would not invite them either. Not even sure i'd invite the uncle.", "Ok so, as a gay woman, NTA. \n\nMy friends and I always say \"half your age + 7\" and normally we're the ones counting up as we're late 20s/mid 30s and as well rounded adults,  dating a teen wouldn't even cross our minds. Heck, when I was 26 a girl lied to me about her age, said she was 23, come to find out after hooking up a couple of times that she was 19 and I broke it off immediately. \n\nYou did sound a little bit judgemental about his longest relationship having been 5 years. 5 years is a long time. \n\nBut I also don't think this is coming from a place of homophobia on your part.\n\nHow long has this kid been 18 for? This has grooming written all over it and good for you for standing your ground.", "NTA, But I would say at least consider that and not allowing your uncle a plus one you are essentially shutting him out. In 10 years you might look back at your wedding pictures and see that half the couples that you invited are no longer together. And you may not remember cousin Bob\u2019s girlfriend\u2018s name. So is it really that you don\u2019t want some random 18-year-old or are you secretly having a problem with the fact that his current boyfriend is considerably younger than him. It\u2019s one person and one person may not be worth a rift especially if it\u2019s one stranger that you probably won\u2019t even interact with. And in terms of being in the pictures that person probably won\u2019t be in your family pictures which are usually the pictures that count. They\u2019ll probably just be a group photos of people dancing and I can guarantee you\u2019re probably not gonna remember everyone\u2019s plus one.  At the end of the day it is your wedding and I can tell you what you\u2019re going to remember most is how your groom looks into your eyes when you\u2019re saying your vows, The kiss that announces to the world that you\u2019re married, and how happy you were to finally be standing with the person that you love and hopefully will cherish for the rest of your life. All of your guest as much as you love and care about them are really going to just be an afterthought to what is important. And what\u2019s important is that on the day that you choose the two of you will effectively declare to the world that you belong to each other. Good luck congratulations and I hope it\u2019s an amazing day regardless of what your decision is.", "NTA.\n\nI was ready to be mad, if it was just because he was gay.  But, no.  It's because he's a predator.  That's completely fair.", "NTA solely as you've said this is a fairly new relationship in a comment and you have a large amount of people to invite\n\nYes your wedding, your rules but if you invited all the other partners and your uncle's relationship was longer than some of the others than I'd be going the other way (ie like it it had been the 5 year one and you invited some other family member's current squeeze of 4 months).", "NTA: I also wouldn't want a random teen at my wedding.", "NTA. The age difference is disgusting/disturbing. If his plus one was a woman instead of a man, everyone on here would be saying what a creepy pervy uncle you have. I'm saying it anyways. You uncle is a creepy perv. I wouldn't want his young, misguided play thing at my wedding and in the photos either. Personally if it were me, I wouldn't be upset if the uncle didn't come, with or without his plus one.", "Info: when you say you invited other people\u2019s partners do you mean i.e. people committed enough you put their name in the invite or did other family members get generic +1s?\n\nEvery wedding has photos with someone\u2019s random +1 at the time in them. If that\u2019s really the reason, you should ask yourself if this is the hill to die on.", "NTA, your uncle is gross, I wouldn't want him parading his grooming victim around my wedding either. Of course I probably wouldn't have invited him either.", "It\u2019s your wedding, but you don\u2019t have to let the partner in your photos.", "NTA.  It's your wedding you can invite who you want.  YWBTslightAH because you're not inviting him because he dates younger men, however, that's not the case here as he is a serial monogamist, it seems.  I wouldn't want some rando 18 year old in my wedding photos either.", "NTA \n\nYour uncle is a predator and honestly maybe you should consider uninviting him to your wedding.", "NTA. Good luck!", "NTA -that\u2019s super gross. He\u2019s grooming a kid. I", "NTA. and I\u2019d uninvited the uncle from the wedding and your life too.", "Lets flip the script to check for biases. If the uncle was straight and had an 18 year old girlfriend, it would still be weird. If it was a 53 year old aunt dating an 18 year old guy, still weird. NTA. I will say a 5 year relationship is longer than most marriages so you could be less judge there.", "In literally almost any other circumstance I'd say yeah YTA but your uncle has a sugar baby, not a partner. Literally what else is a 50 something doing with an 18 year old? That's creepy as fuck tbh", "53/18?? I don\u2019t care what the sexual preference, that\u2019s predatory. I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA. You don\u2019t know this 18 y/o \u201cboyfriend\u201d your Uncle has some serious issues if he thinks this is a true relationship.", "NTA This a hill I would die on. As with most creeps I'm sure your uncle has good qualities. Regardless I wouldn't want that at my wedding. I wish people would speak up more and tell uncle it's not okay to groom young boys. No matter how gay you are and suffered for. Leave the children alone sexually. Stand your ground", "NTA as it seems your uncle is a groomer.\nJust tell the family that want to boycott, that you will update their RSVP to not attending.", "NTA but your uncle is the one you should be uninviting, he's a predator.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding,your choice. If you feel the need to compromise, Maybe he could come later to the reception, he wouldn't be in any of the formal pictures and you won't really cherish the evening ones?", "Nta. You invite who you wanna invite. I would distance myself from your uncle if i were you. Dating teenagers is creepy no matter if it is of legal age.\n\nIm really surprised of the fact that people justifying that relationship. It\u2019s creepy and we all know for a fact that if it isn\u2019t illegal the uncle would go lower. It\u2019s obvious he target young naive teenager who is easily manipulated into a relationship.", "\ud83d\ude02 I don't even have a judgment. All I have to say is - optics, my friend.

Your uncle for being with an 18yo. And that\u2019s his pattern! Gross! \n\nYou for not focusing on that. You don\u2019t really seem to mind it except for the optics. And judging shirt relationships (like come in, 5 years isn\u2019t good enough for you?!?). You still come if as latent homophobic. \n\nI\u2019ll give you ideas for a gracious out of the situation: \n- Focus on the age. Say you cannot be accepting a relationship with someone that could be their partner\u2019s child. Or\n- Make the rule of no +1. Everyone who was already together at the time of your engagement and you know them personally gets invited by name, others not. Or\n- If you are in the US: all invitees have to be of legal drinking age of 21. Exceptions for chosen blood relatives can be made.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding you get to decide who is welcome and who is not. Period! If you are uncomfortable with his relationship he should respect that and either not attend without any trouble. Or attend with respect to your decision.", "Info: why would his date be in family photos? Is uncle the only person without a +1? Is uncle the only gay person invited?", "Your wedding your rules.\n\nHowever is it worth the risk of having your wedding ruined by lots of guests boycotting it over this?\n\nYou could easily ensure that he\u2019s not in the main photos by making them family only etc.", "100 guests isn't tiny, but it's nowhere NEAR the size where anyone should be able to say \"what's the difference, let him bring a date.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA I would call it what it is: \u201cI don\u2019t want some random teen of the month in my wedding photos.

If it was a serious relationship and your uncle didn\u2019t have a history of constant relationship turnover then I\u2019d say suck it up and invite him.\n\nAt our wedding no one got a plus one unless we knew their SO and had met them.

The memory of you denying your Uncle will remain in everyone's mind in the end.", "What guarantee do you have that your marriage will last more than 5 years.

Let your uncle bring his plus one. Your uncle is not going to be in any of the formal photos. In the causal photos, it will be something you chuckle about later; oh, that is Uncle's latest.   Believe me. You will not remember who was at your wedding later unless you look at the photos or guest book.", "Oaky there's a lot to unpack here.   \nI'll start with what no one else seems to be saying, which is that a 53 year old having relations with an 18 year old is...  to put it as nicely as I can, borderline predatory in my opinion. That's not the point of this post, but I felt it needed saying.   \nSo that being said....  \n\n\nYou are being incredibly judgmental, and while you say it's not about how long they've been together, you actually made it about that when you brought it up. You also said in the comments that you and your fianc\u00e9 have been together since you were 12 which to be frank also seems pretty weird to me, but whatever. I'm not here to judge. Oh wait yes I am, because you asked us to by posting this.   \n\n\nSo because he's had bad luck or whatever it is with past relationships you're assuming \"oh this one will be gone with the wind like the others\" and singling your Uncle's relationship out of all the other family bfs and gfs  just so that you can have your \"picture perfect\" wedding.   \n\n\nYeah I think you're being an asshole and a hypocritical one at that.", "18 yo with a 50+ person sounds a lot like grooming.

Having him there instead of his boyfriend gives the implicit okay to what he\u2019s doing, just not it being on display at your wedding.  \n\nBut if you just wanted no signs of a creep at your wedding and didn\u2019t want him there, I\u2019d be behind you.", "YTA. Yes, the age gap is uncomfortable. Frankly, that's a bigger issue to me than your uncle's track record with relationships. Regardless, if you are allowing other +1s, then denying your uncle's is very unfair.\n\nAs far as the photos go, it's unlikely he'll be in more than a couple. That should not be an issue.

Any decent wedding photographer just needs a hint to avoid taking pictures with someone you'd prefer not to be in them.

Those sound like your only two \"reasons\". \n\nSingling our certain partners but not others is simply going to cause family drama - not just before the wedding but afterwards too - these things don't just die out.  If this is the hill you want to die on, go right ahead.  But their negative comments are valid.", "I don't think it should matter if his relationships don't last long or if his boyfriend is significantly too her than him, them being there literally isn't going to affect your wedding negatively.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nIt's not the age gap.\nIt's not being against homosexuailty. (Althought if he was a straight man with a girl everyone would say nta) \nIt's not that your uncle can't keep a partner. \n\nIt's that this is an intimate family gathering. A relationship less than a year old wouldn't qualify to me. He's only been dating him for 4 months. \nIt's not even about pictures, it's about someone that its a stranger being at a big family gathering, a costly wedding no less, that would make me go nope. \nWhat really bothers me is that instead of supporting you, the family member about to be married and making a life commitment to the one they love they are putting a 4 month relationship and a stranger above you. You might be better off letting them make that choice and losing contact or lowering contact with them. \n\nAnd sorry but how dare your uncle make this about him, he should show some grace and understanding, not want to steal the spotlight from you and make it about him and his selfishness. \nAt the point of a  4 month  relationship I wouldn't feel  comfortable intruding on a family wedding and wouldn't want to go if I was the partner.", "Info: Did you invite your uncle with a +1?", "Ewww he's dating a teenager NTA I wouldn't be comfortable with that either", "I was reading this and was gonna say y t a when you said his longest relationship was five years long, kinda like the bridezillas who don\u2019t want anyone who isn\u2019t married because their relationship isn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d but then i saw the age and yeah immediately changed my mind.

So either admit that, yeah, this *is* about you not approving of the relationship for reasons that have nothing to do with gender, or don\u2019t penalize his plus one when you\u2019re not worried about *his* skeeviness messing up your pictures.

You don't have to personally know those partners!! But, do you want your guests to feel good and dance? Or do you want them sitting on their phones at the tables?! \n\nWhat's even worse, is that you have no excuse.

You because you are judging your uncle for the age and length of his relationships. It's not just women that have daddy issues. Your uncle for barely keeping it legal.

Ive sent invites to pretty much everyone and their partners but not my uncle\u2019s partner.\n\nThe reason for this is because my uncle\u2019s relationships don\u2019t last all that long (the longest was 5 years from memory) and more importantly his partners are always quite young. For instance, my uncle is 53 and his current boyfriend is 18.\n\nSo, clearly, I don\u2019t want that at my wedding. It\u2019s nothing against their sexuality or the relationship, it\u2019s got more to do with the fact that the relationship isn\u2019t really a genuine one and will end in a few years at most. Plus, I don\u2019t want to have pictures in my wedding album of a random teenager my uncle was having relations with for a few months. It\u2019s supposed to be a special occasion to share with family.\n\nThe only real reason I\u2019m on here is because my uncle and some others in my family are furious at my decision and are threatening to boycott my wedding if I don\u2019t allow my uncle his plus one.\n\nSo am I an asshole here or is my point of view valid?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get that your uncle dates around a lot (which is fine), but bringing up a 5 year relationship really weakens that point.", "This is an easy NTA although you went through way too convoluted of an explanation when the core of the issue is your 53 year old uncle dating an 18 year old.

But I would refrain from using the length of his past relationships as a reason. I'm sorry, but most people do not marry their high school sweethearts.

You don't get to just completely skip the question part and move right to the pitchforks and then pat yourself on the back for it.", "The \"58 year old consistently dating teenagers\" (which is an assumption you are making, not information in the OP) isn't the hill I'm trying to die on.\n\nThe hill I'm dying on is the, in my opinion, disgusting and toxic and utterly corrosive tendency to equate things we don't like or that make us uncomfortable with things that are either legal or morally indefensible.  For example, the soft (and hard) equations of this \\*53\\* year old dating an 18 year old with him engaging in child molestation, abuse, grooming, etc.  It's particularly telling that not one of you people in this thread who so stridently accuse the Uncle of these things have actually bothered to inquire of OP whether she thinks there is actual abuse going on or taken an interest in the 18 year old other than as a means to condemn the uncle.\n\nThe hill I'm dying on is the ease with which a bullying majority becomes a lynch mob.  And while the stakes in this thread are, of course, nonexistent, this type of lazy, facile, and reductive condemnation and scapegoating has been a horrible undercurrent in American society for as long as I've been alive, and I find it abhorrent in all its forms.", "Bro my man\u2019s 50+ dating a barely legal adult \ud83d\udc80", "I\u2019m guessing your 50 and dating a teenager?", "Legal age of 18 does not make it better he is a child who is not old enough to drink and still needs parents income for any type of college financial aid.  Turning 18 does come with certain rights like voting but it does not come with a wisdom switch there is no  sudden mental change and they are still very moldable and subject to any outside influence.\n\nmany abusive controlling relationships start with a significant age gap and it is absolutely grooming because they don\u2019t have real life experience and other relationships as a baseline", "Everyone here is expending their time and energy to evaluate this relationship given the limited information available. Unfortunately the first impressions people are getting are ones you feel personally attacked by.\n\nBy the way, that isn't the sentence that indicated indifference. In fact, I quoted the part that did. \"Mind your own business until you have actual evidence\". The whole point of this sub is to pass moral judgement based on hearsay, evidence inadmissible in court. Scale back the histrionics, nobody is trying to violate anyone's autonomy the question is do we invite an old philanderer to a wedding.", "The OP literally says his partners are always young. I didn't make any assumptions. That man is a predator who is consistently targeting people young enough to be his grandchildren, people who have barely left highschool. That is not normal or healthy behaviour. You can say it's lazy or reductive but I think it's incredibly alarming you think it's anything close to healthy. At the age of 18 his brain isn't even fully developed. \n\nAh yes the classic lynch mob going after people who aren't even here to read the comments. Nevermind the fact that the target of people's ire is a predator. Also I'm not American. Romancing young boys and girls is generally frowned upon in most places...", "I'm glad we have you to be the morality police."]}
