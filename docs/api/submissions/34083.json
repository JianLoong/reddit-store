{"id": 34083, "submission_id": "18uu1wi", "title": "AITAH for telling my husband he doesn\u2019t do anything.", "selftext": "I 31 female and husband 33 male have 5 children aged 11, 10, 8 and twins 7, all in school. I work 12+hours a day 4 days a week. My husband is a stay at home dad, has not had a job since my twins were 1. Recently I have been coming home frustrated because my husband just starts playing video games and continues all night, I tell him since he is home he need to be making meals for the kids that include vegetables not just pizza nuggets ect, he still only does it once in a while. I have also been coming home to constant dirty dishes, and laundry,  the laundry is mostly washed but stuffed in Laundry baskets constantly ( there are currently 4 full baskets) and it stays that way unless I do it or tell him he needs to and he usually doesn\u2019t finish it all. The bathrooms are never cleaned properly there is green stuff that starts to stick in the toilet bowl so I will have to clean it thoroughly. Today we got in a fight because he yet again stayed up playing games all night after I got home from work, I went to bed around 10 because I get tired after being on my feet all day for 12+ hours. I woke up around 9:30 am, my husband was still sleeping. All my kids were already awake I fed them some breakfast but there wasn\u2019t much in the fridge. I waited for my husband to wake up to ask him if he can go grocery shopping, by 12:30ish I asked him if he could go, he didn\u2019t get up. He didn\u2019t wake up until nearly 4 that afternoon. I was  furious I am always coming home to no toilet paper, food, ect and have to go get it myself, while he has more than enough time all day while I\u2019m at work and the kids are in school. I yelled at him and told him he should already have food in the house and that he doesn\u2019t do anything all day. I was just so frustrated that it\u2019s a constant thing and I would understand if the kids were home all day with him, but they are not they are at school till 3:30 every day, and he still acts like he does everything and has no time in his day to get to the things I mention. So aitah for telling him he does nothing? Update My husband does clean the house just seems to struggle with the specific things I mentioned above and cook , but needs to include veggies more often in my opinion. He also takes my children to all their sports ect. He cooks for me on my days off usually as well but does have days when does the gaming all night sleeping all day. I just work a lot and am exhausted some days and want to know if I\u2019m taking it out on him.", "created_utc": 1703981552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uu1wi/aitah_for_telling_my_husband_he_doesnt_do_anything/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure your husband \"does things\" - he plays video games, sleeps, and makes chicken nuggets for dinner. I'm thinking you could get paid help for less hassle, though, and stop taking care of your husband and his jobs too. He can go (back?) to work outside the home and remember what responsibility and mornings look like. \n\nOr you follow others' advice and go the divorce route.", "You're mistaken. You don't have 5 kids, you have 6.\n\nI don't know how women put up with this, how can you bear to live with a man like that??\n\nAnd why do you?

It won\u2019t be any easier but you will have one less mouth to feed and pile of laundry to do.", "NTA. How did you get into this situation?  If a spouse is a SAH the home should be their job.", "NTA. Your husband has apparently become accustomed to not holding up his end of the bargain when it comes to being a stay at home dad. If I were you I would sit down and have a serious discussion with him to let him know that his inactivity and non support as a sahd is coming to an end either in the form of him getting a job or getting a divorce. In the meantime most of if not all of your kids are at an age where they can do a little something around the house to keep the clutter down. They can help to fold and put away their clothes, sweep the floors, vacuum, and help tidy up a bit. I know they go to school but on the weekends they can be of more help. Getting them into this habit now will help them in the long run set good habits for themselves, and may finally get you to the conclusion that you don't need your husband around.", "NTA, but you cannot put up with this any longer. You need to consult a lawyer and your husband needs to get his shit together.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for hubby to go get a job.\n\nHire a cleaner to come clean weekly N pay someone to pick up your kids from school.\n\nGood luck", "I mean, it\u2019s hard to get much done when you\u2019re Very Busy\u2122\ufe0f playing video games. /s\n\nYou\u2019re what\u2019s called a \u201cmarried single parent,\u201d ie, you\u2019re basically a single parent but you\u2019re technically married.

You\u2019d likely have *less* to do if you did separate because you would then only be responsible for yourself + 5 kids instead of yourself, 5 kids, and one useless adult. \n\nAnyway, NTA. The SAHP is supposed to be responsible for the majority of the housework once the kids are in school. Also, the only reason a 33 year old should be sleeping until the afternoon is if they work a late shift, which isn\u2019t the case here. Playing video games all night is not a valid excuse for a fully grown, fully functional adult to sleep all day.", "\u201cI\u2019m a helpless wife in a relationship with a shit husband who does nothing and I let it go on for umpteen years and kept having babies with him anyway.

But NTA for telling him the truth.", "NTA but he is.\n\nAre you better off with him or without him? I know what my opinion is in that regard.", "I agree with all the NTA but also it sounds like your husband might be depressed. If you want to try working it out, he probably needs to get some professional help and/or medication.", "NTA, I think it's time for you to realize that you're already a single mother, with the only difference being that you're also supporting your useless husband. \n\nYour husband behaves like a child, and you already have five other children to raise and take care of; you can't afford to waste time with him too.

If the kid is in diapers, should the working parent help? I have 1 in school and a toddler. But pregnant with HG and anemia. My husband still doesn't help out because he makes the money( his words). He often stays at work weeks at a time ( free comfy accommodations) and I often just parent solo. I try my best to keep the house but he still complains the house is a wreck."]}
