He was unwelcome home and has since asked for property back several times to be met with- your wife owed us money by her sisters.\n\nYou see in 2016 the seven siblings including my grandmother purchased a property together although it was speculated whether or not it was done \u201cofficially\u201d. And money from my grandfather\u2019s inheritance was used to fix the place up. But when grandma died in 2020- grandpa was encouraged to leave and told their names were never put on the deed. My father and I were also asked to leave well enough alone. We were not even given t-shirts to make a quilt from her belongings. \n \nMy grandma took the place of my dad growing up. She did every event, every birthday, every phone call, every child support payment. I flew across the world from Japan to take care of her in her final days. She was my best friend. And it bothered me dad had shown up with an interest in her property and my grandfather was treated so poorly. But it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything I could do.\n\nFast forward, 2023. Grandpa is asked to sign documents to agree to the sale of the home? He is told he is not entitled to any money. My father who is routinely homeless and a drug addict will be gifted $30,000 plus. They\u2019ve verbally agreed dad will pay grandpa for taking care of him.\n\nWhat?\n\nTurns out. Grandma\u2019s name was on the deed. And her property was left unclaimed and moved without her husband\u2019s knowledge into an estate. Is there a document saying her spouse isn\u2019t entitled to her estate? No he hasn\u2019t signed anything. Yet.\n\nWould I be the asshole for filing a lien on the home to stop the sale\u2019s proceeds from going to my father? He owes that much in arrears in child support which has no statute and has evaded taxes. I don\u2019t trust that he will gift this sudden windfall to grandpa. \n\nHonestly\u2026. If grandpa wasn\u2019t alive and dad was entitled to the money\u2026. I would do this then donate it just to spite him because he was so cruel to his parents and I all this time.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that the family lawyer will just cut dad out of the process and my small family never see the money.
