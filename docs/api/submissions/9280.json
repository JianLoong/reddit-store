My spouse comes from a family of people who are well-loved. His parents went out of their way to make sure they were supportive (working opposite schedules so someone was always home, etc) and the children always felt safe and loved. To this day, his family's favorite thing to do is sit and have dinner together, even though both children are 30+. I did not. I grew up in a home where my siblings were competition for basic needs in a house where there was never enough food and always too much anger. My siblings and I check in with each other once or so a year, and I haven't spoken to my parents in years. \n\nMy ILs have a really hard time with this. Last year I almost died and had to have emergency surgery, and I did not tell me family until after (and their response was more offensive than nothing.) We have just learned not to talk about it. When family comes up, I usually say I don't want to talk about this. If they push it, I just say \"family means something different to me than it does to you.\" \n\nIt took a while, but now they just drop it.

My maternal family was abusive AF and my father's family was AWOL. Through a lot of patience and effort, I was able to build a relationship with my father and his family in my late teens.

It's a catch-22. I want to be part of the family, but I also don't trust them enough to get closer.
