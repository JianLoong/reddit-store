I had an incredibly abusive mom and it made me hate the consept of blood families.

When I was a teen, I had the chance to go away from my mom and went living with my dad. Since they were divorced for a long time, he has his own family now. He has a wife who has two older kids. She is pretty cool but she puts her own family on a pedestal and sees it as the ultimate form of happiness. I'm pretty sure she sees is as so important that it becomes a little toxic for her. \n\nWhen I mooved in, I told her on multiple occasions that I didn't cared if anything happens to my mom, and she seemed shocked, why ? Because \"she is still your mom and because she is my family, you still have to be respectfull\". And she didn't stopped telling me that I should still give her respect, even if she abuses all of her kids (me and all 3 of my sisters). It has been almost 3 years since I mooved in and even to these days, she still insists that my mom is still my mom and I should respect her. \nThose comments increased my negative view on families, and it made me even more rude about it. It got so bad that at one point, after my parents told me that no matter what, family is family and i should respect them, I told them that they should stop telling me this because, in the end, family doesn't matter that much for me. \n\nThis, of course, infuriated my step mom and acted like I insulted her whole family. They keep on and on pressuring me to love with no condition my family despite my past. But the more i think about it, I wonder if it was kind of a shit moove to tell her that family isn't that important, especially if they abuse you. I know she can't understand it because her family is rather good. And I still said it out of stress and anger. \n\nTldr : step mom keeps telling me that i should care about my family no matter what, despite having trauma related to it, and told ther that i give little fucks about it and it made her upset.", "created_utc": 1675693472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v7uh6/aita_for_telling_my_family_that_i_dont_see_family/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are two kinds of kids, those that feel nothing for their abuser and they tend to go NC in adulthood and those that are constantly trying to get affirmation and validation from their abuser still.

I was very lucky because my husband and I laws couldn't stand to be in the same room as my mother so I had a lot of support and my siblings and kids are all NC with her too.

You're unable to stop applying one example to all situations because of this, and it may interfere with future relationships if you don't address it.\n\nYour mom needs therapy to break the cycle, too, and that will fix her relationship with you.
