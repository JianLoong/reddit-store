A couple of things: \n\n1) She\u2019s apparently fully aware she\u2019s being inappropriate, and is doing it on purpose. That\u2019s not a \u201cpersonality trait\u201d, that\u2019s being a jerk.  She is absolutely waiting until you eat in order to put you in a situation where you able to leave easily.  (Edit: just read that where she sits is *literally* trapping you in a corner\u2026yes\u2026I have had two emotional abusers do that to me before, where they would use this technique to trap me while they ranted at me\u2026while I was trying to eat.)\n\n2) She mentioned she already has other friends who like to talk about this stuff with her (as opposed to talking *at* you with no engagement on your end)\u2026so if she wants to talk about those subjects, she already has a constructive outlet.  \n\n3) At what point is your husband going to tell his friend to stop trying to pimp him?? Yuck. Why on earth has he allowed it to get to the point where you\u2019ve had to say something to him about it?  If a friend ever talked to me and my husband about pimping me out, I\u2019d be putting my foot down because it would make me uncomfortable \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t wait until it made my husband uncomfortable.  So that\u2019s really the thing here\u2026it sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t find this line of suggestive talk offensive\u2026and that might be part of the bigger issue here.  If I had to a stab at it, she\u2019s been involved with him before you two married, and is now finding herself 3rd wheel\u2026is she being this way because she\u2019s trying to offend you out of jealousy?  Is she suggesting pimping him out to gauge if you\u2019re ok with sharing him?", "NTA. This is some weird kink level nonsense. She enjoys humiliating you and degrading you and making you uncomfortable.\n\nStop making excuses for her. She needs to go\u2014or you do. I cannot even imagine my husband allowing anyone to treat me this way even once let alone for years. This is sick.", "NTA Doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s always done this. It\u2019s still rude and just plain a bad \u201cpersonality trait\u201d.

She\u2019s disgusting. \u201cI\u2019ve always grossed people out\u201d is just another way of her saying \u201cI\u2019m an AH, I\u2019ve always been an AH and I will embrace it and continue to be an AH\u201d. Next time she does it stick your finger down your throat and vomit on her. Then just look at her and say you enjoyed it and intend to do it every time she\u2019s near you while you\u2019re eating. Sometimes when the dog craps on the floor you have to rub their face in it. Just sayin\u2019\u2026.", "NTA, but: time to lose the roommate situation.", "I'd give her toe old heave ho to be honest.  If she can't bother to change, then out she goes. nta", "NTA\n\nIf you really want to be petty. Next time she does this, tell her this is why people hate her. She likes to be gross.

No need to make excuses for her, she admits it is deliberate.", "You didn't say anything that really proved she was saying this stuff to make you intentionally sick while you are eating, and I think the entire thing is honestly silly. It sounds like maybe she is uncomfortable in silence, or perhaps she is still very hyper-focused on those events and she's just talking bc she needs to and for many people, meal time is also sharing time.  She probably isn't realizing that it might be grossing you out. Your husband had the correct and civil approach.\n\nNTA but you should probably work on tolerance of others.
