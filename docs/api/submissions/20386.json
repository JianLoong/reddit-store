Her and I get along good for the most part but some things really tip me over the edge. It's like she purposely tries to make you uncomfortable whenever you're eating. I've known her for going on 3 years (hubby has known her for like 10 years- before her transition) and she's always been like this, from what I've seen and what my husband has told me. \n\nEvery single time I am eating, she will either talk about her transition surgery in vivid detail, talk about her and her girlfriends bedroom life in vivid detail or talk about ways me and my husband can make some extra money (by hooking my husband up with other women for cash). She thinks it's hilarious. She will be staring at me while I'm eating with a shit eating grin on her face just being gross and saying ignorant shit. It would be one thing if she stood far enough away from me so I had space but that's not the case. She stands at most 1.5 feet away while she's talking about this stuff and seriously way too close to me and I'm starting to get thoroughly grossed out by her presence. \n\nI talked to my husband about it and I told him that I'm getting so pissed by her even speaking to me anymore and that every time she walks in the room, I want to leave. Because she literally only starts conversations like this when I'm eating and I don't even remember when I was able to enjoy a meal. So, he spoke to her, in front of me, at the next meal. He said \"this isn't really over the dinner talk. It's actually really gross.\" She starts laughing and says something like \"I've always grossed people out so I'm used to it\" or something like that and then brings up trying to pimp my husband out again. I kind of snapped at that point and told her she needs to get the fuck away from me when I'm eating because I'm tired of her purposely trying to make my stomach turn and that no one finds her bullshit funny but her. She got offended and said she was \"just trying to lighten the mood\" and that her other friends openly talk about this stuff so she's trying to include us in conversation that she wants to have. I still told her to leave. AITA? My husband feels bad because she truly always has been like this since he met her 10 years ago and he thinks it's just some weird personality trait.", "created_utc": 1687526185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gybzc/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_to_get_away_from_me/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
