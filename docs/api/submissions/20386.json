I touched the jar my sisters gall stones were in. I will talk about the grossest things, but umm read the room. Not everyone is made for that. The one thing that bothers me is teeth that\u2019s a nope for me even mine. Nope. But every other bodily function while eating idc any kind of conversation you want to have as long as teeth aren\u2019t involved I\u2019m game but not many people are like me. Read the room. OP is in no way TA. She\u2019s been told numerous times. Clearly OP doesn\u2019t want to hear it why keep bringing it up? That\u2019s a huge AH.", "A Lot of TS people are on the autism spectrum. It could just be she generally doesn't understand that it \"isn't ok\" without being explicitly told.\n\nThis isn't being an arsehole. Just having a different set of social boundaries.", "As I said in my reply to someone else. Zero evidence of that.\n\nThey've never brought it up before to her, and most adults aren't that mental. My bets are heavily on the room mate not realising it's that big a deal, because it's normal chat in her main friend group and the husband has never had an issue with it in 10 years. And OP hasn't just talked to her like a normal adult about it. And OP blowing an imaginary enjoyment her husband's long term friend has, into trying to make her feel sick when eating.\n\nI really really doubt it's deliberate. If it is, then the room mate is mentally unstable at best. But more than likely, the room mate had no clue it was such a big deal until OP just blew up at her and started shouting that she's not funny and is disgusting.\n\nAs I said in my example, I know two adults who've been deliverable ignoring me for 2 years at parties. Because they wife thought I'd ignored her once two years ago. They were completely convinced I knew they were doing it. I had absolutely no fucking clue, which when they just apologised the other week, confused the life out of them. Because I do not go around assuming other adults, and friend's of my partner or other friends for 10+ years, are mentally unstable and conspiring against me. And if something weird has been going on that I'm aware of, I'd not wait 3 years to talk to them about it and just explode and call them unfunny and gross unexpectedly.\n\nBets heavy on room mate having no clue it mattered that much to OP... and obviously OPs husband doesn't really care or is bothered by it himself, just cares that it's upsetting his wife. Who tells him to deal with it, rather than just taking to the other member of the household herself like a normal adult.\n\nWilling to bet the room mate never brings this up again now she knows.", "Fair, mine don't, so to each their own I guess. But either way, obviously normal for her other group. If OP has never mentioned this in 3 years and she's been like this since she met her... the room mate has no reason to suddenly think it's a problem. To the room mate it's fine and normal. It should'nt have taken OP 3 years to mention it, and the first mention be her snapping after her husband said one single line about it.\n\nSometimes finding out your flatmate has hated you and your chat for 3 years unexpectedly, or to be in the same room as you, takes more than a single line to sink in. Her immediate response was to be offended and say she was just trying to include OP in her usual chat, like she does with her main group of friends. That's not saying to me,  that's someone who's been tormenting her deliberately for 3 years.\n\nOP should just've brought this up in a normal conversation with her, at any point in the last 3 years.", "No she hasn't. She's endured it for nearly 3 years. Then just told her husband she can't stand it recently. Made him go and talk to the room mate, snapped in the conversation and started shouting at the room mate she's not funny and is gross...\n\nThere is zero mention about her talking to her about this ever, at all, in the last 3 years. That's what a normal adult would do, yes.\n\nBut OP hasn't said she's done that anywhere. She held it in, made her husband go deal with it then shouted at the flat mate.\n\nI literally give an example of two other adults in my life, doing similar to me for 2 years over a perceived slight I had no idea about. She's had 3 years to tell the flat mate she can't deal with it, but all she says in the post is how she's found it gross for years and the flatmate has been like this since she met her.\n\nOp's first mention of ever bringing it up is \"I snapped at that point.\", after the husband said one line about it... and that's it. And the immediate response was for the roommate to feel offended and say she was just trying to include her...\n\nThat's not a story telling me about an adult spending 3 years deliberately trying to torment OP...", "Pronouns aren\u2019t about respect, they\u2019re about being a decent human being. If someone tells you their pronouns and you continue to misgender them it\u2019s because you\u2019re an asshole", "Well maybe I'm wrong then. Either way its really weird and rude", "Starting your story with \"my late husband\" and concluding it with \"he never did it again\" makes your advice sound a little more drastic than you intended, I think hahaha\n\nBeyond that, I can see the value in it : if OP can't finish her meal because she's too grossed out, might as well put the food to another use.", "Baby poop", "They do know they were told and continued to do it that's when op blew up", "Omg. Sitting here laughing so much. Never thought of that. Still laughing as I\u2019m typing. Too funny. My daughter and I both have that personal space thing. I\u2019ve put my hand out a hair\u2019s breath from someone\u2019s chest to signal them to back up on out of my space. We both actually loved the 6ft from others during the height of Covid. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "To be fair to you, while you didn\u2019t grasp the literal meaning of the saying, you did get the actual intended meaning. That one\u2019s also a pun though, so if you aren\u2019t familiar with the joke meaning, it\u2019s just a weird way of saying the intended actual meaning. I remember never getting \u201cWhy did the chicken cross the road?\u201d as a kid because I didn\u2019t understand the joke formula it was subverting", "No they weren't.\n\nRead OPs post. Why do people keep saying this.\n\nOP has had an issue with this for 3 years and never once mentions bringing it up ever. Until now. And the first time is \"I just snapped at that point\".\n\nAnd the roomates response is to feel offended and say she was just trying to include her in the conversation she has with her usual friend group. And presumably even OPs husband for the last 10 years.\n\nNeither of them have just approached the flat mate and said 'hey, this convo and that you also keep doing it whilst eating dinner, is really not working for me. I dont enjoy it, want to hear it, or find it funny. It just makes me feel uncomfortable and puts me off my food. Can you please stop doing it?\"\n\nNot a single mention of that. This was their first ever convo and one \"dude not cool at dinner\" isn't enough to explain what's going on and how badly its affecting OP, or why after 3-10 years it's suddenly an issue. OP should've brought this up herself with her flat mate of 3 years at any point. Her first time doing so is snapping at her instead.", "Same! Having space and avoiding those air kisses and excessive handshakes! Bliss!\nThe rest was terrible, but I'm not going back to those greetings.\n\nHappy to amuse, it also struck me as funny, esp because I could tell it was unintentional hahaha", "Why is that \u201cthe worst way possible\u201d\n\nGod people are just desperate for this to be a trans thing", "The husband literally said something to the roommate and the roommate proceeded to talk about pimping out op\u2019s husband. She was told but continued. She knew what she was doing and op had every right to be upset. You can\u2019t do something repeatedly, get told someone doesn\u2019t like it, do it again, and then get offended when someone is upset with you for it. That\u2019s acting like a child", "Makes me think of the Key & Peele skit of the gay coworker being extremely sexual & gross & when his coworker tells him off & acts disgusted, always says \"oh, is it because I'm gay??\" Hopefully the roommate isn't trying to set up OP for allegedly being transphobic by having an issue with her. I actually had a coworker like that, who would talk about his hookups in great detail at work & when people didn't want to listen or were disgusted, he acted like they were homophobic \ud83d\ude44 he turned out to actually be super racist himself."]}
