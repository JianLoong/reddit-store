The comment was a little judgmental, but not insulting and seemed to be worded very diplomatically and coming from a good place. \n\nAlice reported the comment and asked me to ban the person for \u201cmaking her feel judged\u201d.  \n\nJulia wasn\u2019t being mean, or intentionally insulting, or racist, or hateful and I read the rules and she didn\u2019t break any of them.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do, but it was my role to play judge, jury, and executioner so I just deleted the original post to avoid all the drama. \n\nAlice called me an asshole.\n\nEdit: it is within the rules to ask for/give away anything legal. The following is the wording of the group rules:\n\nWe are a gift economy\nMarket economy related posts e.g. offers/asks for items for sale/rent/ barter/trade or job/real estate posts may be deleted. Ask your local group Admin for the voucher/coupon/gift card policy.\nAsk, give, and share creatively Our focus is on freely gifted goods and services. We believe in abundance, simply ask for what you want. And share your gratitude!\n\nEdit2: In Alice\u2019s DM to me she admitted that she was not a resident of my town which violates the rule to only belong to one group in the town you live.

I left the page because its maddening to see them constantly soliciting help with food or having a \"rough patch\" every couple of months while on their main page showing off their high value purchases (in this case tattoos).\n\nMy one piece of advice is to maybe post on the front page of the buy nothing group a list of area resources for chronic hunger relief because there are a LOT of people who are desperate. There is nothing wrong for asking for a hand up or a little help now and again but when it becomes a cycle of constantly overspending on luxuries (of which tattoos are) and not being able to make ends meet as a result, that is a problem.

It's not her place to explain to this stranger what she thinks about the stranger's finances. This is a Buy Nothing group. \n\nI understand that nothing Julia did was against the rules. Maybe that is an oppurtunity to review what rules you need. It sounds like you don't have rules about kindness, conduct, how to treat fellow users. Rules like that are pretty necessary IMO. It's obviously ultimately not my choice but it seems that snooping on the personal feed of a user in need and making comments about their finaces SHOULD be against the rules.\n\nI think this is a light YTA: I think deleting Julia's comment (though not banning her) and explaining she was being unkind was the best thing to do.", "YTA simply because it seems like it was within the rules for her to ask so it doesn't seem like she actually violated the rules by asking for food.\n\nAlso, some tattoo artists have you put down hefty deposits or prepare for your artwork.", "Unpopular opinion but YTA\nYou have no clue what Alice\u2019s situation was. Perhaps she had an unexpected bill come up between getting the tattoos and buying groceries. Perhaps she was given the tattoos as a gift or given money specifically for the tattoos by a loved one. Or, maybe she just didn\u2019t do the best job budgeting that week. It doesn\u2019t really matter. Poor people deserve nice things too. Food is a human right. \n\nAlice shouldn\u2019t have to go hungry. Even if she didn\u2019t spend her money as wisely as she could have. Plus, she\u2019s posting on a buy nothing group asking for food. She\u2019s not harassing anyone or demanding anything special. If people don\u2019t want to give her food, they don\u2019t have to. \n\nJulia wanted to feel \u201cholier than thou\u201d and she 100% was being judgmental. The fact that she went on Alice\u2019s profile, probably trying to find a reason to say something snarky, is gross. \nIf you didn\u2019t feel like Julia\u2019s comment broke guidelines, you could have told Alice that you would not block her.

If someone chooses to give to Alice, then great. If someone else reads Julia's comment and decides not to give, then fine. No one was ever obligated to help.
