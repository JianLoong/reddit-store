Is she trying to reason with Lily at all? Make any kind of rules so Lily understands?\n\nNo matter what, I think you need to tell your friend it's an approved dress or nothing. That might sound a bit callous but it's not like you're trying to force her into an ugly, uncomfortable dress. She still gets a choice... just not a big, red, oversized t-shirt.\n\nIf your friend refuses to make this clear to Lily, then both of them need to know that she can't be a flower girl.", "NTA - A 6yo is old enough to understand that certain activities are privileges and require you to dress and act a certain way.

If she wants to be a flower girl, she has to wear a fancy dress that is white, silver, or navy and follow the instructions about when to walk down the aisle. \n\nTell your friend that while you would love her daughter to be the flower girl, the color and style of dress she wears for the ceremony is non-negotiable.", "NTA.

It's not her birthday, it's you wedding.\n\n\nShe can wear any formal dress that's the correct colours. If she doesn't want to, she can't be the flower girl. Choices have consequences, and don't feel you have to indulge every whim for a child that isn't even yours!", "Honestly I'd just ask your friend what she thinks. \"Hey BF, do you think Lily would prefer to wear the dress she's loves as a guest instead?  Or will she be willing to wear something that matches the bridal party?\"", "NTA.  You are being very generous by saying you would be fine with her wearing it after the ceremony. And you're right, those colors don't go at all with anything else you picked out.  Sounds like your friend has an inability to teach her daughter that with events like weddings, you should only wear whatever attire is appropriate.  She's the mom, she should put her foot down and say, \"you're wearing this dress, or you're not going.\"", "NTA \n\nThe better way to go about it is \"hmmm, that's a cute dress- but I need her to wear this to my wedding- so please get the correct size ordered.\"  Send a specific dress- there's too many options and you're working with a 6 year old, and a parent who clearly isn't thinking about what's really important (your wedding=you're the priority).  \n\nThis is more of a mom problem then an issue with the 6 year old.  You gave mom the instructions, not the 6 year old- so you're telling mom \"no\", not the 6 year old.  If you start with taking the 6 year old out of the wedding party vs. course correcting the outfit you're going to lose mom from the wedding party also.  If it goes that direction-probably for the best, but just be prepared for it.\n\nMaybe the 6 year old can wear that Jersey to her birthday party or an event that is important to her, but this is your wedding which is important to you.  Your bridal party has assigned outfits, and if folks don't want to wear their outfits or perform their assigned duties- then they aren't right for the honor and responsibility of being in the wedding party.", "It\u2019s your wedding.  You get to decide.  I wouldn\u2019t un-invite the child, but would definitely mention that you are wanting a different dress style.  If they don\u2019t want to wear it- that\u2019s fine, but you would rather not have a flower girl that doesn\u2019t match your theme, if that\u2019s the case.  NTA.", "NTA. I'd say to your friend that a criterion for being flower girl is that the child needs to dress in the range of colours/styles that you suggested (you seem to have suggested a good variety). If she wants a different dress, then she can come as a guest but not as a flower girl. \n\nThis might also be a good way to frame it to the little girl. She may not have appreciated that the invitation came with basic conditions, but her mother should.", "Why on earth is Lily's mom complicit in this \"casual flowery jersey dress\" nonsense? Six year olds don't understand about different levels of formality, dress codes, and the like. She sees a dress she likes with flowers on, knows that she's the flower girl, and thinks she's sorted.\n\nHer mom knows better.

If the kid absolutely must wear this dress, she can wear it to another occasion. But be prepared because her mom will bow out too. You need to be ok with that.That may be best anyway because if this is the attitude she may be difficult during the actual wedding.

If you don\u2019t want to it\u2019s totally ok for you to just sit with your family.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to expect someone in your wedding party to follow rules as simple as you\u2019ve made them. These aren\u2019t overbearing in any way.

Your friend should have put her foot down to her daughter long before it got to this point", "YWNBTA\n\nIt's your wedding. You should be able to have it look the way you want. Having her wear the red dress at the reception would be the perfect solution. Is her mom helping you explain why the jersey dress isn't appropriate for the ceremony? Because she should be. If the girl won't cooperate, it's totally your prerogative to pick a different flower girl.", "NTA but your friend's lack of involvement in this situation is really bizarre to me. Any remotely sane parent would have told their kid that they have to wear an appropriate dress for the occasion, would have gotten her a dress that matched the criteria, and would have given it to her to wear the day of. And if she refused and threw a fit, a normal parent would then choose to not bring her to the ceremony. Like, what is the deal with her mom? \n\nLily is six, there's a decent chance she'll be happy to wear an appropriate dress the day of. There's also a nonzero chance she'll throw a tantrum. You don't have a problem with Lily, you have a problem with her mom. I actually do caution you about having Lily as the flower girl. Generally when you have little kids in a formal event like this, their parents are supposed to be right there prepared to wrangle them if things go wrong. Can you trust her mom to do that?", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it is ridiculous that her mother is forcing you into the position of bad cop rather than explaining to her daughter that here are the choices: you either come to the wedding as a guest in the red dress, or if you want to be the flower girl, the uniform is a fancy white, silver or navy dress. \n\nIt's Not. That. Hard.\n\nAnd even if the 6-year-old doesn't get it, no way do I believe your best friend is completely clueless about how weddings and color schemes work. So I don't get what she's trying to pull here. But I would NOT back down on this and have an out of place cringey kid in a clashing non dressy outfit in your wedding party. You have offered a lovely compromise by suggesting she wear that to the reception and wear the pretty matching dress to the ceremony. If she doesn't want to participate in the ceremony wearing matching dresses like Mommy and the bride and the other big girls, she can be a guest. Up to her!", "NTA because it\u2019s your wedding, and you quite literally control the event, down to the wardrobe choices. Plus you\u2019ll have pictures that will last the rest of your life that you absolutely will want them to look tidy.", "NTA, you can simply get another child to do it, or have none at all.", "NTA\n\nBut her mom needs to handle this. Send a photo of the 2-3 dresses she can pick from. Let her mom explain she can pick one of these dresses or she cannot be the flower girl. That\u2019s not being mean. That\u2019s an adult & a child playing their appropriate roles.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't meet your requirements. You can't force her.\n\nIt's OK that it doesn't work out.", "NTA\n\nis it Lily or her mum that really want\u2019s this dress.   Doesn\u2019t make sense the mum would stand by and say nothing\n\nEither way, you would be well within your rights to determine dress code for your bridal party.", "YWNBTA. It is a formal event and there are some expectations on how to dress. Lily has the choice to follow the dress code or come as a guest in whatever dress she wants. Both are valid choices and there is no problem with making her choose.", "NTA part of being in a wedding is wearing what is appropriate. I am sorry what she wants isn\u2019t appropriate.

I was super nice and flexible about things and still had a black tie optional wedding with people that coordinated properly and no one ever accused me of being pushy or anything. Your friend is over the line. You know how easy getting my cousin\u2019s flower girl dress was? Three weeks before the wedding I woke up from a nap and realized we should probably find her something, especially since she was 10 and that\u2019s older than most traditional flower girl dresses are sized for. So my aunt and I did a quick Amazon search and found her a black tie appropriate white dress that even had some features that matched mine for $65 that was delivered the next day. You didn\u2019t give your friend a hard task, she\u2019s made it hard on herself because she needs to be the one to shut this down and it\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s put this responsibility or stress on you.\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA", "But also don't concede on something just because you don't want to stress or cause an issue though, OP, and end up unhappy. It's still *your* wedding and it should be how you want it. Not wanting a clashing dress in your wedding party is far from \"bridezilla\" behavior. And a 6 year old is old enough to understand wearing certain things for certain occasions and some things are not appropriate for certain occasions. I have a 7yo daughter who understands dressing appropriately for the place/occasion and the weather, and she definitely understood this at 6. The flower girl at my own wedding was 6 when her dress was chosen and 7 at the wedding and she understood that even though it wasn't her usual style (she wasn't a dress wearer), that in order to be the flower girl, she had to wear that dress, not some random thing she chose. \n\nI attended a friend's wedding some years back where a friend's daughter had been asked to be the flower girl. She loved wearing dresses, but for whatever reason, she had a tantrum about the flower girl dress that was chosen for her and didn't want to wear it. Her mother, rather than put her foot down and say \"you have to wear this dress or you don't get to be flower girl\", just dressed her in something else. It was a cute outfit, but it wasn't what the bride and groom wanted or paid for, and she looked out of place and didn't match anyone else in the wedding party (it was a casual outfit in a completely different color scheme) and the marrying couple was annoyed and upset. \n\nAnd, if it seems silly or drama-causing to put your foot down over a 6yo's dress, don't forget the flower girl is in the pictures. If you concede on letting her wear the red dress, you'll be reminded of it every time you see the pictures, which may not be the memory of your wedding day that you want. You might have bigger regrets of having a red clashing dress in your pictures for all time than about telling a child and a friend no. I agree that wearing the red dress to the reception, like others have suggested, is a perfectly acceptable compromise. But you're NTA for not wanting it/allowing it at the ceremony and booting her as the flower girl if she doesn't want to wear any of the options you presented. She's old enough to understand this and you're being more than generous by giving her choices. Her mom kind of sucks for even asking you to do this and offering it as an option to her instead of just telling her child no, IMO. I also think you're being taken advantage of. \n\nI know firsthand how stubborn 6yo girls are, but 6yo girls can and need to be told *no* sometimes. It's **your and your fiance's day**, not hers.", "Lol! You see why there is so many childfree wedding these days. It isn\u2019t because brides are a bridezilla it\u2019s because so many parents will not tell their kid NO and think that kids should run the show.", "edit: nevermind I misread the \u201cshe does wear dresses\u201d as \u201cshe doesn\u2019t\u201d\n\nwhat about a navy suit? if she doesn\u2019t wear dresses that might be more comfortable, but also still formal and on theme?", "But the mom probably thinks her child sis special and should get to do what they want.", "No worries. Yeah, a suit would be totally fine but she doesn't want that either. She just wants the red casual dress.", "Six year olds are fickle creatures. Maybe have mom buy her the dress and wear it to a messy activity so the dress can't be worn anymore? Or encourage her to wear it during the rehearsals.

It is up to you which of these you pick.\" If they keep pushing, I tell them I will choose if they don't. There are times they get more choices (like, I recently gave my younger daughter a price limit and told her to choose a leotard as her \"congratulations\" for moving up a level in gymnastics), but when I really need them to pick something with specific criteria, I limit it to about 3 pre-approved choices.", "When you want a child to make a certain choice, you give them two options which are both acceptable to you.\n\nSo you send Lily and her Mum a picture of two dresses and say \u201cWhich of these dresses would you like to wear at the wedding ?\u201d\n\nIf she says \u201cNeither\u201d or \u201cI want the red dress\u201d you can tell her, \u201cI need a Flower Girl who will wear one of these dresses, because its a very special occasion for me, and if you don\u2019t want either of them, I\u2019ll have to ask someone who will\u201d\n\nShe may chuck a fit, she may not.

I wish you a happy marriage and a beautiful wedding day!", "NTA\n\nThere's a dress code for those who are a part of the ceremony and it should be followed. It's your wedding. Your vision. You and your partners that is. \n\n\nSaying she can wear her preferred attire for the reception/party is very reasonable", "NTA.  The mother just sounds obstinate.", "Nta. You gave your friend the honour of inviting her daughter to take part in your wedding, she knows the red dress is would be an issue and she is going to find out what that means.  Just tell her you are disappointed with her that she will not work within your set parameters.  You made it generous enough to have options of styling but the choice of colours has already been predetermined.\n\nIf Lily won\u2019t compromise to wear it after the ceremony and at the reception and wear a dress in the preset colours of your wedding, then she will no longer be a flower girl at your wedding.  It will be disappointing to have her miss out but that would come down to her and her mothers choice.", "NTA you simply make it clear to her mother that she needs to along with this or you will need to find someone else.  Her mother should be correcting her choice not you", "NTA. \u201cThis isn\u2019t appropriate for the event I\u2019m hosting.\u201d Her mom is ridiculous and needs to take control of the situation", "Maybe she can wear the Jersey dress to the rehearsal. Nta", "NTA", "Get a different flower girl for the ceremony and let her wear her red dress and throw rose petals for your entrance to the reception.", "NTA\n\nBut Lily's mother certainly is as she is the one who can't seem to tell her daughter no and making you the bad guy. \n\nIf you're done trying to compromise I would tell your friend that you're happy her daughter found a dress she loves but it's not wedding appropriate and it will be easier for everyone if you skip on having a flower girl.", "It\u2019s actually way too early to be buying a dress for a 6 year old for an event that is 7 months away. Kids grow, unpredictably.  In November, this girl could be the same size as she is now, or she could be three sizes larger. I\u2019d park this whole discussion until September, honestly.  Tell the mom that in the fall you will give her three options for a dress and can pick one then.", "NTA. \n\nIf your wedding is in November, why not let it go for a couple of months? If Mom can get a clue, she can buy something off the rack after the 6yo has had time to forget. Won\u2019t she grow anyway?\n\nAnother option: change the job description to Jr Bridesmaid. Then call a good store in your area & ask them to pull appropriate dresses for an appt (that Mom schedules) \u2014 Nordstrom in the US is great at this. The store might even stretch to doing the try-ons in a fancy dressing room. Little one never sees anything that won\u2019t work for you.", "NTA but really this shouldn\u2019t have even come to the point where you knew about it, let alone needed to make a choice. \n\nYour best friend is the one who made this an issue by not parenting appropriately.", "NTA.\n\nBut, she probably wants that dress because it has flowers, and she's a flower girl. Maybe as a compromise you could find a floral dress in your colors?", "NTA", "Nta her mom should be redirecting her daughter to the choices you gave. Stand your ground.", "This nta. Op if I were you I\u2019d tell your friend that she should get her kid that jersey dress for play dress up if she really wants to. but then give them 3 options to pick from for the flower girl dress. Giving too many options causes complications.", "It\u2019s not a secret that 6-year-olds are a tad impulsive. And if mom is doing her job, she should be able to say something like, \u201cYes, that is a great dress but we need (X) for the wedding.\u201d", "The mother dropped the ball here. She\u2019s the one who went shopping, she needed to speak up.", ">The flowery sweater dress idea should never have come near you - mom should have shut that idea down as soon as it appeared. Mom is an AH.\n\nThis is exactly right. I'm sure the mom was like, \"oh I'll just ask OP just in case,\" or some other rationale to get her out of the impasse with her daughter. Just passing the buck.", ">The flowery sweater dress idea should never have come near you - mom should have shut that idea down as soon as it appeared. Mom is an AH.\n\nThis is exactly right. I'm sure the mom was like, \"oh I'll just ask OP just in case,\" or some other rationale to get her out of the impasse with her daughter. Just passing the buck.", "I also wasn\u2019t super into wedding planning and tried to keep everything as easy as possible. When I asked my niece(4) what she wanted to wear as a flower girl she said an orange dress- her favorite color and would\u2019ve clashed horribly. I sent a few pictures for her to look at and she didn\u2019t like any of them so I decided to just not give her the choice. I found a super cute dress on Etsy that was inexpensive and had great reviews, specifically for comfort. My niece ended up loving it and was happy to wear it all night. She was especially happy that she matched my other niece (6 months) and her aunts, my bridesmaids, and she loved spinning in the tulle skirt.", "I'm sorry you know so many jerks, I guess? But that's not the norm.", "It's your wedding, put your foot down and tell the mom NO! That dress is not acceptable, stick to the original colors or she can't be on the wedding party!", "NTA. Just rescind the invitation for Lily to participate. Sometimes kids just don't everything they want.", "If you let a six-year old dictate the fashion of the wedding party, well, I don\u2019t even know what to say. She either gets with the program or gets left out.", "NTA but why are you telling the six year old she gets to choose anyway? She's six, of course it's not going to end well.", "NTA OP.  It\u2019s YOUR wedding and it sounds like the flower girl is a bit stubborn.", "When Lily gets married, she gets to pick out a tee shirt dress.", "This exactly. My 6-year-old was recently asked to be in a friend's wedding, and I went and picked samples of appropriate outfits and let them choose only from those, AND I made it clear that the bride would need to approve of the final choices before we bought them. It is not a difficult concept for a child that age to understand that some clothes are not appropriate for certain occasions.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Talk to the mom, let her be the bad guy. She should have been doing it already. If she won't put her foot down with her own child, then find another kid. This is your wedding, you and your fiance get the final say!", "Exactly. You can\u2019t leave it wide open. When my son was little, a girl in his day care wore a bathing suit and weird looking skirt in the middle of winter. I said something offhand and the mother said \u201cshe picks out her own clothes.\u201d I\u2019m thinking why tf were those even options. Makes you wonder why it\u2019s called common sense when it\u2019s not all that common.", "I agree, plus it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a backup dress for the reception. Hell, after my mums funeral, my best friend and I (both10) stole two tops from my grandmother to wear just so we could get out of our \"pretty clothes\" that we felt so uncomfortable in. This flower girl is 6, she might get uncomfortable in the dress, or she might spill something on it. Backups are always handy, especially at formal events. 6 is also a good age to start trying to teach how to compromise.\n\nNTA  but your bridesmaid/flower girls mother is one for making you the bad guy instead of stepping up and parenting their child.", "My only rules for my kids' clothes are that it must be weather and occasion/location appropriate. I do buy all their clothes, and they're too young to be pushing for revealing stuff yet, so I'm not worried about just appropriate in general. No shorts in winter, no jacket in 100\u00b0 weather, no sandals at school, no bathing suits or leotards outside of their use zone, and no fancy clothes at the park. They must also wear snow gear in the snow. Other than that, they can knock themselves out with mismatched socks, clashing patterns, tutus over leggings, etc. They're learning their styles and experimenting in appropriate ways.", "Love the backup dress idea.", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf70", "NTA. it's your special day and you're spending A LOT of money to make it as perfect as possible. People who are apart of your bridal party should follow what you say and make the day the best day of your life, the bridesmaid shouls try harder to explain this to her daughter.", "ESH- this is several months away! If her mom got her the jersey dress she can wear it to her heart\u2019s contents for the next few weeks and then it might get dirty or go out of rotation. She\u2019s 6 years old. ESH for not understanding the fickle nature of kids and working with it, rather than forcing a hard decision several months in advance.", "NTA, And honestly, this whole dilemma is your friend's, her mom's, fault. She just goes  with what is easier. She should be the one to teach a kid about basic social etiquette and that different attire is appropriate for different situations. Your wedding is not a time and place to cater to a spoiled child's whims.", ">The bride (if she's really nice) gives you choices\n\nI was a flower girl twice, and no one gave me any choices - I wore what I was told \ud83d\ude05 \n\n(Honestly, that might be a better way to go with small kids? They see things pretty black and white, so this little girl probably heard \"I get to choose\" not \"you can choose one of these\". Her mum should absolutely be the one handling this though!)", "elope, its  a lot easier"]}
