You have to choose one of the options she sent.  If you are not willing to, you do not get to be in the wedding.  Period.***\n\nIf the little girl chooses not to dress appropriately in approved attire, she doesn't get to be a flower girl. \n\nOR\n\nTell them you've decided you don't need a flower girl.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA.  Her mother should understand the expectations of a flower girl and limit her options to acceptable choices.  Being asked to be a flower girl is an honor.", "NTA. While 6yos are notorious for being stubborn, you shouldn't feel held hostage by her at your own wedding. But this should be her mom's problem, not yours. What has your friend said about it? Is she trying to reason with Lily at all? Make any kind of rules so Lily understands?\n\nNo matter what, I think you need to tell your friend it's an approved dress or nothing. That might sound a bit callous but it's not like you're trying to force her into an ugly, uncomfortable dress. She still gets a choice... just not a big, red, oversized t-shirt.\n\nIf your friend refuses to make this clear to Lily, then both of them need to know that she can't be a flower girl.", "NTA - A 6yo is old enough to understand that certain activities are privileges and require you to dress and act a certain way. If she wants to play soccer, she needs to wear sneakers and shin guards and listen to the coach. If she wants to be a flower girl, she has to wear a fancy dress that is white, silver, or navy and follow the instructions about when to walk down the aisle. \n\nTell your friend that while you would love her daughter to be the flower girl, the color and style of dress she wears for the ceremony is non-negotiable.", "NTA. Make it clear she can't wear that to the ceremony.  You are the bride, you have a colour scheme. The End. It's not up to her to pick any style/colour. It's not her birthday, it's you wedding.\n\n\nShe can wear any formal dress that's the correct colours. If she doesn't want to, she can't be the flower girl. Choices have consequences, and don't feel you have to indulge every whim for a child that isn't even yours!", "Honestly I'd just ask your friend what she thinks. \"Hey BF, do you think Lily would prefer to wear the dress she's loves as a guest instead?  Or will she be willing to wear something that matches the bridal party?\"", "NTA.  You are being very generous by saying you would be fine with her wearing it after the ceremony. And you're right, those colors don't go at all with anything else you picked out.  Sounds like your friend has an inability to teach her daughter that with events like weddings, you should only wear whatever attire is appropriate.  She's the mom, she should put her foot down and say, \"you're wearing this dress, or you're not going.\"", "NTA \n\nThe better way to go about it is \"hmmm, that's a cute dress- but I need her to wear this to my wedding- so please get the correct size ordered.\"  Send a specific dress- there's too many options and you're working with a 6 year old, and a parent who clearly isn't thinking about what's really important (your wedding=you're the priority).  \n\nThis is more of a mom problem then an issue with the 6 year old.  You gave mom the instructions, not the 6 year old- so you're telling mom \"no\", not the 6 year old.  If you start with taking the 6 year old out of the wedding party vs. course correcting the outfit you're going to lose mom from the wedding party also.  If it goes that direction-probably for the best, but just be prepared for it.\n\nMaybe the 6 year old can wear that Jersey to her birthday party or an event that is important to her, but this is your wedding which is important to you.  Your bridal party has assigned outfits, and if folks don't want to wear their outfits or perform their assigned duties- then they aren't right for the honor and responsibility of being in the wedding party.", "It\u2019s your wedding.  You get to decide.  I wouldn\u2019t un-invite the child, but would definitely mention that you are wanting a different dress style.  If they don\u2019t want to wear it- that\u2019s fine, but you would rather not have a flower girl that doesn\u2019t match your theme, if that\u2019s the case.  NTA.", "NTA. I'd say to your friend that a criterion for being flower girl is that the child needs to dress in the range of colours/styles that you suggested (you seem to have suggested a good variety). If she wants a different dress, then she can come as a guest but not as a flower girl. \n\nThis might also be a good way to frame it to the little girl. She may not have appreciated that the invitation came with basic conditions, but her mother should.", "Why on earth is Lily's mom complicit in this \"casual flowery jersey dress\" nonsense? Six year olds don't understand about different levels of formality, dress codes, and the like. She sees a dress she likes with flowers on, knows that she's the flower girl, and thinks she's sorted.\n\nHer mom knows better. The flowery sweater dress idea should never have come near you - mom should have shut that idea down as soon as it appeared. Mom is an AH.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If the kid absolutely must wear this dress, she can wear it to another occasion. But be prepared because her mom will bow out too. You need to be ok with that.That may be best anyway because if this is the attitude she may be difficult during the actual wedding. Just say, I\u2019m really excited to have you at the wedding but the flower girl needs to wear a certain dress. If you don\u2019t want to it\u2019s totally ok for you to just sit with your family.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to expect someone in your wedding party to follow rules as simple as you\u2019ve made them. These aren\u2019t overbearing in any way. I think if her mom can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) explain to her little girl she needs to wear something else for the ceremony then the mom is the problem here - not you.", "NTA. that\u2019s your wedding. not hers. Your friend should have put her foot down to her daughter long before it got to this point", "YWNBTA\n\nIt's your wedding. You should be able to have it look the way you want. Having her wear the red dress at the reception would be the perfect solution. Is her mom helping you explain why the jersey dress isn't appropriate for the ceremony? Because she should be. If the girl won't cooperate, it's totally your prerogative to pick a different flower girl.", "NTA but your friend's lack of involvement in this situation is really bizarre to me. Any remotely sane parent would have told their kid that they have to wear an appropriate dress for the occasion, would have gotten her a dress that matched the criteria, and would have given it to her to wear the day of. And if she refused and threw a fit, a normal parent would then choose to not bring her to the ceremony. Like, what is the deal with her mom? \n\nLily is six, there's a decent chance she'll be happy to wear an appropriate dress the day of. There's also a nonzero chance she'll throw a tantrum. You don't have a problem with Lily, you have a problem with her mom. I actually do caution you about having Lily as the flower girl. Generally when you have little kids in a formal event like this, their parents are supposed to be right there prepared to wrangle them if things go wrong. Can you trust her mom to do that?", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it is ridiculous that her mother is forcing you into the position of bad cop rather than explaining to her daughter that here are the choices: you either come to the wedding as a guest in the red dress, or if you want to be the flower girl, the uniform is a fancy white, silver or navy dress. \n\nIt's Not. That. Hard.\n\nAnd even if the 6-year-old doesn't get it, no way do I believe your best friend is completely clueless about how weddings and color schemes work. So I don't get what she's trying to pull here. But I would NOT back down on this and have an out of place cringey kid in a clashing non dressy outfit in your wedding party. You have offered a lovely compromise by suggesting she wear that to the reception and wear the pretty matching dress to the ceremony. If she doesn't want to participate in the ceremony wearing matching dresses like Mommy and the bride and the other big girls, she can be a guest. Up to her!", "NTA because it\u2019s your wedding, and you quite literally control the event, down to the wardrobe choices. Plus you\u2019ll have pictures that will last the rest of your life that you absolutely will want them to look tidy.", "NTA, you can simply get another child to do it, or have none at all.", "NTA\n\nBut her mom needs to handle this. Send a photo of the 2-3 dresses she can pick from. Let her mom explain she can pick one of these dresses or she cannot be the flower girl. That\u2019s not being mean. That\u2019s an adult & a child playing their appropriate roles.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't meet your requirements. You can't force her.\n\nIt's OK that it doesn't work out.", "NTA\n\nis it Lily or her mum that really want\u2019s this dress.   Doesn\u2019t make sense the mum would stand by and say nothing\n\nEither way, you would be well within your rights to determine dress code for your bridal party.", "YWNBTA. It is a formal event and there are some expectations on how to dress. Lily has the choice to follow the dress code or come as a guest in whatever dress she wants. Both are valid choices and there is no problem with making her choose.", "NTA part of being in a wedding is wearing what is appropriate. I am sorry what she wants isn\u2019t appropriate. I would just let your friend no that since Lilly isn\u2019t into dressing up fancy then she is more than welcome to be a guest and wear what she wants.", "Yes, you would be downright evil if you did this.", "YTA. This sub has made me hate weddings.\n\nI assume you asked the little girl to be your flower girl because she's important in your life. If you want to take that away from her over a dress, I feel like you've lost the plot.", "YTA, she\u2019s 6 and November is ages is away so give it time and make it clear it\u2019s not option.

I was super nice and flexible about things and still had a black tie optional wedding with people that coordinated properly and no one ever accused me of being pushy or anything. Your friend is over the line. You know how easy getting my cousin\u2019s flower girl dress was? Three weeks before the wedding I woke up from a nap and realized we should probably find her something, especially since she was 10 and that\u2019s older than most traditional flower girl dresses are sized for. So my aunt and I did a quick Amazon search and found her a black tie appropriate white dress that even had some features that matched mine for $65 that was delivered the next day. You didn\u2019t give your friend a hard task, she\u2019s made it hard on herself because she needs to be the one to shut this down and it\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s put this responsibility or stress on you.\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA", "But also don't concede on something just because you don't want to stress or cause an issue though, OP, and end up unhappy. It's still *your* wedding and it should be how you want it. Not wanting a clashing dress in your wedding party is far from \"bridezilla\" behavior. And a 6 year old is old enough to understand wearing certain things for certain occasions and some things are not appropriate for certain occasions. I have a 7yo daughter who understands dressing appropriately for the place/occasion and the weather, and she definitely understood this at 6. The flower girl at my own wedding was 6 when her dress was chosen and 7 at the wedding and she understood that even though it wasn't her usual style (she wasn't a dress wearer), that in order to be the flower girl, she had to wear that dress, not some random thing she chose. \n\nI attended a friend's wedding some years back where a friend's daughter had been asked to be the flower girl. She loved wearing dresses, but for whatever reason, she had a tantrum about the flower girl dress that was chosen for her and didn't want to wear it. Her mother, rather than put her foot down and say \"you have to wear this dress or you don't get to be flower girl\", just dressed her in something else. It was a cute outfit, but it wasn't what the bride and groom wanted or paid for, and she looked out of place and didn't match anyone else in the wedding party, and the marrying couple was annoyed and upset. \n\nAnd, if it seems silly or drama-causing to put your foot down over a 6yo's dress, don't forget the flower girl is in the pictures. If you concede on letting her wear the red dress, you'll be reminded of it every time you see the pictures, which may not be the memory of your wedding day that you want. You might have bigger regrets of having a red clashing dress in your pictures for all time than about telling a child and a friend no. I agree that wearing the red dress to the reception, like others have suggested, is a perfectly acceptable compromise. But you're NTA for not wanting it/allowing it at the ceremony and booting her as the flower girl if she doesn't want to wear any of the options you presented. She's old enough to understand this and you're being more than generous by giving her choices. Her mom kind of sucks for even asking you to do this and offering it as an option to her instead of just telling her child no, IMO. I also think you're being taken advantage of. \n\nI know firsthand how stubborn 6yo girls are, but 6yo girls can and need to be told *no* sometimes. It's **your and your fiance's day**, not hers.", "Lol! You see why there is so many childfree wedding these days. It isn\u2019t because brides are a bridezilla it\u2019s because so many parents will not tell their kid NO and think that kids should run the show.", "edit: nevermind I misread the \u201cshe does wear dresses\u201d as \u201cshe doesn\u2019t\u201d\n\nwhat about a navy suit? if she doesn\u2019t wear dresses that might be more comfortable, but also still formal and on theme?", "But the mom probably thinks her child sis special and should get to do what they want.", "No worries. Yeah, a suit would be totally fine but she doesn't want that either. She just wants the red casual dress.", "Six year olds are fickle creatures. Maybe have mom buy her the dress and wear it to a messy activity so the dress can't be worn anymore? Or encourage her to wear it during the rehearsals. Then she still gets to have the red dress but doesn't wear it during the actual ceremony?", "NAH. \nThat said, is this really worth stressing over?

My kids are very strong willed, so they can push back a bit and try to deviate, but I tend to just repeat, \"These are your choices. It is up to you which of these you pick.\" If they keep pushing, I tell them I will choose if they don't. There are times they get more choices (like, I recently gave my younger daughter a price limit and told her to choose a leotard as her \"congratulations\" for moving up a level in gymnastics), but when I really need them to pick something with specific criteria, I limit it to about 3 pre-approved choices.", "When you want a child to make a certain choice, you give them two options which are both acceptable to you.\n\nSo you send Lily and her Mum a picture of two dresses and say \u201cWhich of these dresses would you like to wear at the wedding ?\u201d\n\nIf she says \u201cNeither\u201d or \u201cI want the red dress\u201d you can tell her, \u201cI need a Flower Girl who will wear one of these dresses, because its a very special occasion for me, and if you don\u2019t want either of them, I\u2019ll have to ask someone who will\u201d\n\nShe may chuck a fit, she may not.
