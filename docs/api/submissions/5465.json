About 8 months ago, an old friend \u201cJoe\u201d (37M) moved to my area and I offered him a place to stay until he found something of his own. I\u2019m sure you all know what the housing market is like right now so he is still with me. There is no lease because he is still looking but he is currently paying me $500/mo + $120 in utilities for a bedroom and private bathroom. A *very* good price for the area.\n\nMy girlfriend of almost 2 years, \u201cAmy\u201d (32F) has been dealing with some serious health issues for the last few months and I would like her to move in with me. She was slightly hesitant to lose her own apartment because she has an amazing deal but she has come around to the idea since certain things are difficult for her to do on her own at the moment. She and her 2 cats will be moving in by mid January. \n\nJoe is very much against this and even more so because I do not want any rent money from Amy. She has high out of pocket healthcare costs right now and I don\u2019t want her worrying about having the money. She works remotely and will continue to work but stress will not help her condition.\n\nJoe doesn\u2019t want to share space with another person (he has stated he is especially uncomfortable living with any woman he is not related to or in a relationship with) and does not want to live with Amy\u2019s cats. He\u2019s expressed that he feels it\u2019s unfair for him to \u201cshoulder\u201d the cost of another person and wants to reduce his rent but I don\u2019t believe he is shouldering any additional costs. Nothing will increase for him. I offered to reduce his utilities to $100 but he called that an \u201coffensive\u201d offer. \n\nHe has been complaining all week and this morning, I invited him to shut up or move out. He told me I am being unbelievably selfish by ignoring his desire to be comfortable at home and violating his rights as a tenant (as far as I can tell, that appears to be entirely untrue). AITA?\n\nEDIT: I answered this in a comment but I keep seeing this question so I\u2019ll add it here - Joe and Amy can\u2019t swap because she rents from a family friend which is why she gets the deal that she does. The rent will be significantly higher for the next tenant and out of Joe\u2019s price range.", "created_utc": 1671818750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztojja/aita_for_moving_my_girlfriend_in_to_my_house/", "score": 421, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2018s your girlfriend and you\u2018re doing the right thing \u2014 it\u2018s YOUR home and he has no say in anything. He can and should find something for himself if it bothers him so endlessly!", "NTA. It\u2019s your home. Joe is temporarily renting out a room you offered at a discounted rate so he wasn\u2019t homeless. It seems like he has no intention of looking for a place and intended on taking advantage of you and making it a permanent situation", "\u201cJoe\u201d is seeing himself as a long-term tenant at this point, and will certainly make your GF feel unwelcome. And will likely make sure that the cats disappear (leaving doors open, etc.). The question is, do you need his money? Because, if you don\u2019t the best course of action is to give him a month notice to move out.", "Wow, absolutely NTA. Joe is being incredibly entitled and taking your generosity for granted. It's your house, you're giving him a smoking deal on the rent. He doesn't want to share space, and maybe doesn't like cats (weirdo), which is fair, but he doesn't have equal rights to the homeowner, you.", "NTA - why is he so entitled to YOUR house? I know he is paying rent, but he has a great deal with you. \rYou are very considerate of your girlfriend, because thanks to your offer she will be able to have more money for her medical bills. So, if Joe doesn't want to live with her, then he can move out, his decision. If he decides to stay, and then starts being mean to Amy, then you should kick his ass out.", "r/chosingbeggars  much??\n\nDefinitely NTA, it's your house. He has absolutely 0 say in it.", "NTA, not at all.  I would just kick him out, honestly.  You did him a favor and he's acting in a very entitled way.", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR house, not his. You were nice enough to let him move in at a considerably less cost than if he was paying rent elsewhere. What was short term obviously turned long term for him and it sounds like he has no intentions of looking for another place. \n\nAmy is your girlfriend and you can have her move in whenever you want, he has zero say in it. He's talking out his ass about the bills and him \"shouldering\" someone else, he just doesn't want her to move in.  I think you may want to give him a time frame of when to move out.", "Joe's an AH - you gave him a place to stay, and his contribution to your costs is well under the market rate. Whether by allowing him to stay and accepting rent from him, you created any kind of tenancy is a question that depends on your local laws. In general, it's your home and you live in it, so you can almost certainly evict Joe at will.\n\nNTA", "Info: does he pay a flat rate for utilities or does he pay the actual cast of utilities? \n\nIf it is a flat rate then he isn't really shouldering any increased costs. \n\nNTA \n\nIt is understandable to not want to live with cats or another person ( I love cats) but you are right he options are to shut up or move out, it is not his house.", "NTA you're allowed to choose your girlfriend over your friend so put up or shut up", "NTA--- You OWN this house....he is merely a guest with no official lease....", "NTA, he can move out tho, this guy smell like an incel too ew", "NTA. But it sounds like Joe might retaliate against your girlfriend and her cats if you don\u2019t take action. So I\u2018d strongly consider if your home would be a safe and comfortable living space for them, while Joe still lives there. \nIt\u2019s a really shitty situation to be in, as no matter what you decide to do, your friendship with Joe is probably over.", "NTA.  Joe may qualify as a tenant though depending on local laws.  He could also try to squat/force you to evict him, which again, based on local laws, could take months.  That wouldn't prevent Amy from moving in though.", "NTA. Seems he's your tenant rather than your roommate, and he's renting that bedroom/bathroom. Your house, your rules.", "NTA - the people who expect spouses to have the same graces as spouses are weird to me - of course you're not charging her rent, she's not a tenant!\n\nSince there's no contract I'm aware of, and I don't think your raising his rent due to her arrival- he can work harder on finding a new place if it is an issue.", "NTA. Tell him it's time to get his own place.\n\nI used to have a friend that I took in when he was going through a rough patch. What I realized from the experience was that his rough patch was from using up all the goodwill from a person and then moving on to the next one, but eventually running out of people to take advantage of. He was one of my best friends when he moved in, and we haven't talked since he moved out because I finally saw the kind of person he was.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your house. \n\nHe should definitely feel okay to voice his concerns but what authority does he have in this scenario? The only reason he\u2019s able to object to a new roommate is that you\u2019re doing him the solid of letting him live in your house in the first place.\n\n( That\u2019s not a small thing, I have an extra bedroom and I have a friend who needed a place to stay but I didn\u2019t want to open my home up. It\u2019s a big difference between living alone and living with a roommate.)\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable at all. Like even all the details about your gf don\u2019t matter in my opinion. You could just say \u201cmy girlfriend is moving in because that\u2019s a normal progression of our relationship, you\u2019re welcome to stay here but also you can move out\u201d and that\u2019s really all that\u2019s relevant to Joe.", "NTA\n\nAmy needs to give notice at her apartment to move out of it.  Go ahead and give Joe notice to vacate now and he can move out of your place and into a living situation that suits him better before Amy ever moved in with you.", "NTA. I was all ready to say that you were, but you *own* the house and he's paying below market rent and trying to dictate whether or not you live with your girlfriend? No, your friend is being an asshole--and a stupid one at that. Biting the hand that feeds him is bad tactics.", "You are not the asshole", "NTA\nIt is your house and you are helping your friend out, not the other way around. If he doesn't like what you do, the door was made for a reason.", "Nta. Not his house. Does he realize you are helping him out?", "NTA.  \nIt's your house, and you were clear that you were 1. doing him a favor and 2. expect him to move out asap.  \nbeware tho- angry roommates can make things feel terrible in a home. And, despite only having a verbal agreement - in many countries, you must go through legal eviction to force him to leave if it becomes necessary.  \nRough situation. :/", "NTA. The difference is\u2026 you own the house. This isn\u2019t a 2 bedroom cramped rental situation that only you and your friend are on the lease and you\u2019re introducing another roommate. \n\nYour house, your decision. \n\nYour friend is already getting a great deal for only paying $500/month + utilities to live in a house. Your friend was supposed to be looking for a space of his own and appears to have gotten quite comfy at yours.  He\u2019s really not \u201cshouldering\u201d the costs of another person except for his own.", "NTA. Since he is this unreasonable now, he will probably make her life harder where he can and make her feel unwelcome. \n\nIt's best to give him notice and have him move out.", "Nta. It's is your house. You're helping both of them out and you get to decide who lives there. It would be different if it was an apartment where you and Joe are on the lease, but that's not the case here. Not to mention, it's 3 bedrooms, and you have 3 people now, but I assume your girlfriend is going to be in the same room with you. It's not like you're causing an over crowding situation.", "NTA. Joe, on the other hand, is. You are doing him a favor by providing him with a housing well below the market level, and he wants to dictate who you can or cannot let in your own house? Also, shoulder what, exactly? You are the one paying the mortgage. Whether or not Amy lives there, his rent isn't changing. Utilities, ok, I can see how that would probably need to be adjusted so that utilities are split three ways instead of two ways, so if he was paying $120 before, he should be paying $80 now. Otherwise, Joe is just being spoiled.", "NTA. When you kick him out, make sure to abide by your states landlord tenant laws to avoid any legal issues. Most states require 30 days notice even for squatters.", "NTA- your house your rules. You may want to make up an actual lease agreement if he is going to stay with you for an extended time", "NTA. He is not your roommate. He is your tenant. He can move if he wants. Tell him he deals with it or he moves out.", "NTA, OP. \nIt's none of Joe's business if your girlfriend moves in.\nIt's none of Joe's business if your girlfriend pays rent or not! \nIt IS Joe's business to find his own place though.", "NTA.\n\nYou own the house.  You are the landlord. You make the rules.\n\nJoe should be grateful for below market rent and utilities.  He won't be \"shouldering\" any additional costs.  And you're not violating his rights because he isn't an owner, and his costs aren't going up because Amy is moving in.\n\nIf Amy has such a great deal, would it be possible for her to sub-let her apartment to Joe? Or refer Joe to her landlord?\n\nTo me, it seems like Joe is getting very comfortable living with you and paying so little rent, and he sees Amy moving in as a threat to his continued living situation.  You need to be sure that Joe doesn't interfere with Amy, her employment, or her cats.  He may not be confrontational, but he could act out in a passive-aggressive manner. \n\nTalk to an attorney to determine if you need to give Joe any notice to move out, and to determine what your responsibilities are under applicable landlord-tenant law.", "NTA.", "Nta - joe seems like he just doesn\u2019t like your girlfriend", "NTA You are giving him more than one month's notice and he can move out. It is your home and you decide who will live there. It's probably better for all that he leaves otherwise there will be problems when she gets there.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s your house and you\u2019re doing him a favor letting him stay there on the cheap.\n\nTell him he can GTFO \n\nI can only imagine how awful he\u2019s going to be to your gf when she moves in", "NTA", "NTA. It's your house,  not an apartment where you're both on the lease. The utilities is another thing. Unless 1/3 is $100, that's not the best deal. I think all he can expect is a 3 way split. If he can't accept that, he can face the housing market.", "NTA. Your friend is selfish and he isn\u2019t going to move out. I\u2019d look into how much notice you need to provide and how to legally provide it as he will probably try to quit paying rent.", "It is YOUR home. You let him stay as a favor to him.\n\nHe does not get to dictate who gets to stay at your home and how much they pay,\n\nIf he does not like this arrangement, he is welcome to leave.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Tell him those are his two options....  shut up and live with the new arrangement, or move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd give him a timeframe to move out.", "NTA but if she has a great deal on her flat can Joe move there and her with you so win win?\n\nEither way Joe has no say in who lives there and I would feel uncomfortable leaving him alone with the cats if he hates cats so much!", "NTA. \nCould he move into the apartment your girlfriend is leaving? \n\nI would just tell him that \u201cit\u2019s fine and I completely understand how he feels so this is the date my gf is moving in so you can be sure to be gone by then\u201d . \n\nHim bringing up the \u201crights as a tenant\u201d phrase does raise some red flags that he will try to legally take advantage of you or force your hand in some way idk you should look into squatters rights/tenants rights and make sure you are safe from any legal games he tries to play.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Judges don't like when they bypass rental laws and then want the courts help when it doesn't work out.", "Tbh just because of his reaction I would get him out of here, like if he was just sharing he feels a bit uncomfy and then when you explain that no, your gf gonna live with you he leaves it at that okay, but he insist and keep pestering you, Idk I would not want an headache of what he could do maybe to annoy you or your gf or just of him being an annoying brat", "Could he not just take your girlfriends apartment and sublet it for awhile since she's getting such a good deal on it", "Trust you gut and give him 30 day notice. I truly believe you regret not doing so", "I don't think it applies in the situations where the landlord and the tenant literally live in the same house. The situation you are describing is more for landlords sneakily leasing out units under the table, not the overstaying guest situations.", "This makes zero sense. In what world would the dude take OP to court over this? And for what?", "I wouldn't recommend that.  What if Joes destroys the place while he's there - whether through intentional damage or just not cleaning it for months?  What if he does something to anger the landlord - like loud parties?  Also, this might be considered subletting and the gf may not be contractually allowed to do it.", "The guy has been paying rent and utilities for 8 months.  He's a tenant and not a guest anymore.", "In this world many people stop paying rent and refuse to move until the courts order the police to remove them.  My recent downstairs neighbor was one and since she was family with the owner didn't have a lease. The courts gave the tenants months more time to move and trash the place than they would have if they had had a lease.\n\nCommon sense has nothing to do with the law.", "In an American world.", "He could ask for a lease transfer / to just be considered for the open tenancy if it's not taken if OP and gf think her moving in is a bit more long term. Solves his trouble finding housing....", "Yeah but laws are different if the landlord leaves in the same unit.", "That's true. Lol. I forgot sometimes people just lose all of their shit. \"Your honor, I was completely justified in not paying my already heavily discounted rent for the last 5 months because my landlord let someone with cats move in!!\"", "True, but in this case the roommate is most likely considered a boarder and not a tenant, which (depending on location) likely exempts OP from a lot of those rental laws anyway and definitely makes it less likely a judge would give them more than the standard 30 days. There are never any guarantees though. That said, OP can easily just jack the rate up to market rent with a little notice and get rid of the roommate that way.", "This. OP really needs to check the local jurisdiction, but yes, if they are cohabitating, it's a separate set of laws. Plus, even if Joe is considered a tenant, OP isn't violating any laws by introducing another tenant, even with three people they are well below the maximum occupancy.", "NTA b-bye Joe. This guy is a nightmare thinking that somehow he deserves a rent reduction. And this thing about not being comfortable living with a woman he\u2019s not related to?? Does your gf know that?

While it is your home, you did offer living space to Joe, which he is paying for (even if discounted) and he deserves all the same rights as any other tenant.

Everyone wins.", "He probably is a tenant by now,  legally speaking. This could get ugly", "NTA. Tell him it's your home and his temporary shelter until he finds his own place, which he should have been looking for this while time.

Dude needs to realize he doesn't have as much say as he thinks he does.", "NTA. Tell Joe he can either realise its your house and you can move on whoever you want it he can find his own place.

So, he can suck it up or find a new place.", "NTA you are not two roommates with one roommate trying to move his gf in. You are the landlord, not his roommate.

Goodbye, Joe.", "Evict him.  He has no right to control what you do in your own home.", "Joe is a temporary roommate who is getting a deal at the moment and I hope for his sake that he's been socking money aside for his deposit on an apartment.

He's not acting like a friend, he's acting like an entitled princess. NTA", "NTA. This is a clear case of no good deed goes unpunished.
