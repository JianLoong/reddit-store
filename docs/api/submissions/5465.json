About 8 months ago, an old friend \u201cJoe\u201d (37M) moved to my area and I offered him a place to stay until he found something of his own. I\u2019m sure you all know what the housing market is like right now so he is still with me. There is no lease because he is still looking but he is currently paying me $500/mo + $120 in utilities for a bedroom and private bathroom. A *very* good price for the area.\n\nMy girlfriend of almost 2 years, \u201cAmy\u201d (32F) has been dealing with some serious health issues for the last few months and I would like her to move in with me. She was slightly hesitant to lose her own apartment because she has an amazing deal but she has come around to the idea since certain things are difficult for her to do on her own at the moment. She and her 2 cats will be moving in by mid January. \n\nJoe is very much against this and even more so because I do not want any rent money from Amy. She has high out of pocket healthcare costs right now and I don\u2019t want her worrying about having the money. She works remotely and will continue to work but stress will not help her condition.\n\nJoe doesn\u2019t want to share space with another person (he has stated he is especially uncomfortable living with any woman he is not related to or in a relationship with) and does not want to live with Amy\u2019s cats. He\u2019s expressed that he feels it\u2019s unfair for him to \u201cshoulder\u201d the cost of another person and wants to reduce his rent but I don\u2019t believe he is shouldering any additional costs. Nothing will increase for him. I offered to reduce his utilities to $100 but he called that an \u201coffensive\u201d offer. \n\nHe has been complaining all week and this morning, I invited him to shut up or move out. He told me I am being unbelievably selfish by ignoring his desire to be comfortable at home and violating his rights as a tenant (as far as I can tell, that appears to be entirely untrue *EDIT - I wasn\u2019t clear here, he absolutely does have tenant rights since he\u2019s been living here for this long and is entitled to 30 days notice. I meant nothing I can find supports another person moving in or what they pay being a violation of those rights*). AITA?\n\nEDIT: I answered this in a comment but I keep seeing this question so I\u2019ll add it here - Joe and Amy can\u2019t swap because she rents from a family friend which is why she gets the deal that she does. The rent will be significantly higher for the next tenant and out of Joe\u2019s price range.", "created_utc": 1671818750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztojja/aita_for_moving_my_girlfriend_in_to_my_house/", "score": 1711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2018s your girlfriend and you\u2018re doing the right thing \u2014 it\u2018s YOUR home and he has no say in anything. He can and should find something for himself if it bothers him so endlessly!", "NTA. It\u2019s your home. Joe is temporarily renting out a room you offered at a discounted rate so he wasn\u2019t homeless. It seems like he has no intention of looking for a place and intended on taking advantage of you and making it a permanent situation", "\u201cJoe\u201d is seeing himself as a long-term tenant at this point, and will certainly make your GF feel unwelcome. And will likely make sure that the cats disappear (leaving doors open, etc.). The question is, do you need his money? Because, if you don\u2019t the best course of action is to give him a month notice to move out.", "Wow, absolutely NTA. Joe is being incredibly entitled and taking your generosity for granted. It's your house, you're giving him a smoking deal on the rent. He doesn't want to share space, and maybe doesn't like cats (weirdo), which is fair, but he doesn't have equal rights to the homeowner, you.", "NTA - why is he so entitled to YOUR house? I know he is paying rent, but he has a great deal with you. \rYou are very considerate of your girlfriend, because thanks to your offer she will be able to have more money for her medical bills. So, if Joe doesn't want to live with her, then he can move out, his decision. If he decides to stay, and then starts being mean to Amy, then you should kick his ass out.", "r/chosingbeggars  much??\n\nDefinitely NTA, it's your house. He has absolutely 0 say in it.", "NTA, not at all.  I would just kick him out, honestly.  You did him a favor and he's acting in a very entitled way.", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR house, not his. You were nice enough to let him move in at a considerably less cost than if he was paying rent elsewhere. What was short term obviously turned long term for him and it sounds like he has no intentions of looking for another place. \n\nAmy is your girlfriend and you can have her move in whenever you want, he has zero say in it. He's talking out his ass about the bills and him \"shouldering\" someone else, he just doesn't want her to move in.  I think you may want to give him a time frame of when to move out.", "Joe's an AH - you gave him a place to stay, and his contribution to your costs is well under the market rate. Whether by allowing him to stay and accepting rent from him, you created any kind of tenancy is a question that depends on your local laws. In general, it's your home and you live in it, so you can almost certainly evict Joe at will.\n\nNTA", "Info: does he pay a flat rate for utilities or does he pay the actual cast of utilities? \n\nIf it is a flat rate then he isn't really shouldering any increased costs. \n\nNTA \n\nIt is understandable to not want to live with cats or another person ( I love cats) but you are right he options are to shut up or move out, it is not his house.", "NTA you're allowed to choose your girlfriend over your friend so put up or shut up", "NTA--- You OWN this house....he is merely a guest with no official lease....", "NTA, he can move out tho, this guy smell like an incel too ew", "NTA. But it sounds like Joe might retaliate against your girlfriend and her cats if you don\u2019t take action. So I\u2018d strongly consider if your home would be a safe and comfortable living space for them, while Joe still lives there. \nIt\u2019s a really shitty situation to be in, as no matter what you decide to do, your friendship with Joe is probably over.", "NTA.  Joe may qualify as a tenant though depending on local laws.  He could also try to squat/force you to evict him, which again, based on local laws, could take months.  That wouldn't prevent Amy from moving in though.", "NTA. Seems he's your tenant rather than your roommate, and he's renting that bedroom/bathroom. Your house, your rules.", "NTA - the people who expect spouses to have the same graces as spouses are weird to me - of course you're not charging her rent, she's not a tenant!\n\nSince there's no contract I'm aware of, and I don't think your raising his rent due to her arrival- he can work harder on finding a new place if it is an issue.", "NTA. Tell him it's time to get his own place.\n\nI used to have a friend that I took in when he was going through a rough patch. What I realized from the experience was that his rough patch was from using up all the goodwill from a person and then moving on to the next one, but eventually running out of people to take advantage of. He was one of my best friends when he moved in, and we haven't talked since he moved out because I finally saw the kind of person he was.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your house. \n\nHe should definitely feel okay to voice his concerns but what authority does he have in this scenario? The only reason he\u2019s able to object to a new roommate is that you\u2019re doing him the solid of letting him live in your house in the first place.\n\n( That\u2019s not a small thing, I have an extra bedroom and I have a friend who needed a place to stay but I didn\u2019t want to open my home up. It\u2019s a big difference between living alone and living with a roommate.)\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable at all. Like even all the details about your gf don\u2019t matter in my opinion. You could just say \u201cmy girlfriend is moving in because that\u2019s a normal progression of our relationship, you\u2019re welcome to stay here but also you can move out\u201d and that\u2019s really all that\u2019s relevant to Joe.", "NTA\n\nAmy needs to give notice at her apartment to move out of it.  Go ahead and give Joe notice to vacate now and he can move out of your place and into a living situation that suits him better before Amy ever moved in with you.", "NTA. I was all ready to say that you were, but you *own* the house and he's paying below market rent and trying to dictate whether or not you live with your girlfriend? No, your friend is being an asshole--and a stupid one at that. Biting the hand that feeds him is bad tactics.", "You are not the asshole", "NTA\nIt is your house and you are helping your friend out, not the other way around. If he doesn't like what you do, the door was made for a reason.", "Nta. Not his house. Does he realize you are helping him out?", "NTA.  \nIt's your house, and you were clear that you were 1. doing him a favor and 2. expect him to move out asap.  \nbeware tho- angry roommates can make things feel terrible in a home. And, despite only having a verbal agreement - in many countries, you must go through legal eviction to force him to leave if it becomes necessary.  \nRough situation. :/", "NTA. The difference is\u2026 you own the house. This isn\u2019t a 2 bedroom cramped rental situation that only you and your friend are on the lease and you\u2019re introducing another roommate. \n\nYour house, your decision. \n\nYour friend is already getting a great deal for only paying $500/month + utilities to live in a house. Your friend was supposed to be looking for a space of his own and appears to have gotten quite comfy at yours.  He\u2019s really not \u201cshouldering\u201d the costs of another person except for his own.", "NTA. Since he is this unreasonable now, he will probably make her life harder where he can and make her feel unwelcome. \n\nIt's best to give him notice and have him move out.", "Nta. It's is your house. You're helping both of them out and you get to decide who lives there. It would be different if it was an apartment where you and Joe are on the lease, but that's not the case here. Not to mention, it's 3 bedrooms, and you have 3 people now, but I assume your girlfriend is going to be in the same room with you. It's not like you're causing an over crowding situation.", "NTA. Joe, on the other hand, is. You are doing him a favor by providing him with a housing well below the market level, and he wants to dictate who you can or cannot let in your own house? Also, shoulder what, exactly? You are the one paying the mortgage. Whether or not Amy lives there, his rent isn't changing. Utilities, ok, I can see how that would probably need to be adjusted so that utilities are split three ways instead of two ways, so if he was paying $120 before, he should be paying $80 now. Otherwise, Joe is just being spoiled.", "NTA. When you kick him out, make sure to abide by your states landlord tenant laws to avoid any legal issues. Most states require 30 days notice even for squatters.", "NTA- your house your rules. You may want to make up an actual lease agreement if he is going to stay with you for an extended time", "NTA. He is not your roommate. He is your tenant. He can move if he wants. Tell him he deals with it or he moves out.", "NTA, OP. \nIt's none of Joe's business if your girlfriend moves in.\nIt's none of Joe's business if your girlfriend pays rent or not! \nIt IS Joe's business to find his own place though.", "NTA.\n\nYou own the house.  You are the landlord. You make the rules.\n\nJoe should be grateful for below market rent and utilities.  He won't be \"shouldering\" any additional costs.  And you're not violating his rights because he isn't an owner, and his costs aren't going up because Amy is moving in.\n\nIf Amy has such a great deal, would it be possible for her to sub-let her apartment to Joe? Or refer Joe to her landlord?\n\nTo me, it seems like Joe is getting very comfortable living with you and paying so little rent, and he sees Amy moving in as a threat to his continued living situation.  You need to be sure that Joe doesn't interfere with Amy, her employment, or her cats.  He may not be confrontational, but he could act out in a passive-aggressive manner. \n\nTalk to an attorney to determine if you need to give Joe any notice to move out, and to determine what your responsibilities are under applicable landlord-tenant law.", "NTA.", "Nta - joe seems like he just doesn\u2019t like your girlfriend", "NTA You are giving him more than one month's notice and he can move out. It is your home and you decide who will live there. It's probably better for all that he leaves otherwise there will be problems when she gets there.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s your house and you\u2019re doing him a favor letting him stay there on the cheap.\n\nTell him he can GTFO \n\nI can only imagine how awful he\u2019s going to be to your gf when she moves in", "NTA", "NTA. It's your house,  not an apartment where you're both on the lease. The utilities is another thing. Unless 1/3 is $100, that's not the best deal. I think all he can expect is a 3 way split. If he can't accept that, he can face the housing market.", "NTA. Your friend is selfish and he isn\u2019t going to move out. I\u2019d look into how much notice you need to provide and how to legally provide it as he will probably try to quit paying rent.", "It is YOUR home. You let him stay as a favor to him.\n\nHe does not get to dictate who gets to stay at your home and how much they pay,\n\nIf he does not like this arrangement, he is welcome to leave.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Tell him those are his two options....  shut up and live with the new arrangement, or move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd give him a timeframe to move out.", "NTA but if she has a great deal on her flat can Joe move there and her with you so win win?\n\nEither way Joe has no say in who lives there and I would feel uncomfortable leaving him alone with the cats if he hates cats so much!", "NTA. \nCould he move into the apartment your girlfriend is leaving? \n\nI would just tell him that \u201cit\u2019s fine and I completely understand how he feels so this is the date my gf is moving in so you can be sure to be gone by then\u201d . \n\nHim bringing up the \u201crights as a tenant\u201d phrase does raise some red flags that he will try to legally take advantage of you or force your hand in some way idk you should look into squatters rights/tenants rights and make sure you are safe from any legal games he tries to play.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I seriously didn't read past \"I own a 3 bedroom house\"\n\nIt's your fucking house, your fucking rules. Anyone who doesn't like it can leave. Friends that do anything to control your life or pull your emotional strings aren't real friends.", "So you might want to check out the local tenant\\landlord laws where you are.  Joe's situation is something that would probably be more accurately legally defined as a squatter.  Unless there's a signed lease, he's not likely entitled to lessee rights and even then, where I'm located anyways, only a year long lease would require 30 days notice.  A month to month requires a week's notice and a week to week requires 3-4 days notice IIRC.  So you may need to look into squatter rights because I'm assuming he receives mail there.\n\nBut this isn't r\\legal.\n\nOP, you're NTA for being so saintly about helping your gf and not wanting her stressing about stuff.  Your 'roomie' needs to find other accommodations, as he's with out his welcome imo.", "I guess technically by reddit rules of the world you'd be NTA but regardless of if you own the place or not I feel like it's pretty shitty move to just up and add an extra roommate regardless of what your roommate think. \n\nWhat if you didn't own the place and your land lord half way through your lease told you that he was moving in his son to your place?\n\nWhen your roommate signed a lease he was under the assumption he was going to be living with this number of people for the term of the lease. \n\nSo for those reasons. I think YTA", "Technically it's your house, but he lives there as well, and you're being very inconsiderate of his wishes. \n\nYou're also being an ass by saying he can just leave. We get it, you're so super magnanimous by giving him arguably cheap rent. Wow. But then forcing him out, especially with how things are these days, and over a girlfriend. \n\nYou're definitely the asshole. And you'll regret it if he goes. I promise. \n\nI've done that very thing. I've been where you are. And I forced my oldest friend out so I could move a woman in. The relationship didn't last and it was then I could put things into perspective. \n\nSome people don't like having their peace or area disturbed. Extra/new people add a lot of tension as they're not aware of the flow of a home. They're needlessly or accidentally loud. There's extra utilities always. Food goes missing constantly. There's no way you can help that even by having talks with this girlfriend. It's going to happen.", "Lmao did YOU read anything in this post?? He\u2019s clearly concerned for his gf\u2019s comfort and health and obviously cares about her a lot.

I'm personally very paranoid about people with my pets (and especially cats because honestly dogs are more accepted), but if he's already acting negatively towards the cats I would be super uncomfortable if I were your GF. \"Accidentally\" buying a poisonous plant, leaving strings around that could necessitate surgery, letting them outside, I grew up with overprotective cat parents so I'll stop....", "Maybe that\u2019s Joe", "Best one out of all of them!", "I used to say \"Let's hit the road, Jack!\" when I was taking my son to go out and about and eventually he started saying it, too.

Sounds like Joe doesn't like your girlfriend. \nYou are trying to do right by your girlfriend. I think you need to choose, he doesn't seem eager to leave.  He kinda reminds me of Stewart from big bang theory. But he was a nice guy and I have my doubts about your friend... \nHe most likely won't be nice to her so I'd give him proper warnings for behavior and be prepared for an eviction fight.

I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019d believe he gets a vote you your life choices in your own home but you should dissuade him of his delusion.

Other than that he doesn\u2019t really have any valid complaints.", "NTA he can move out if he doesn\u2019t like it.", "If he doesnt like the new arrangement, hes free to stay in a hotel or air bnb until he finds something to lease.

I was none of Joe's business in the 1st place. Now he is using it against OP. Stop letting friends and family know your financial business!", "Nta. Looks to me Joe isn't really looking for another place to live... He already sees your house as his, which is problematic...", "He's a renter not a roommate.\n\nHe's being unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nPeople seem to get confused at the differences between renting a place and renting a place where the property owner is also a tenant. I'm not sure whether there are legal differences, but there are definitely logistical and interpersonal differences. \n\nNow, really, Joe's got his own bedroom and bathroom, so it's not like he's sharing his private spaces with her or the cats. Public spaces (living room, kitchen, etc.) should be negotiated *before* she moves in, and she *needs* to be in that conversation. Cats are wandering little critters, so it's important to decide where they can/can't wander, where the litterbox(es) will go,what to do in case of emergency or accidental escape, and how to deal with any animal dander or litter dust allergies that may arise. It's literally like having two four-legged toddlers living with you. (I have a canine and a feline toddler in my house. If you're not prepared for parenthood, this'll help you decide whether you want children. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23) \n\nThis conversation is important for you and your girlfriend to have, now, too - regardless of whether Joe stays or moves out. \n\nI think it's great that you want to help your girlfriend, but understand that you may have to choose between your roommate and your girlfriend. Of course, her health is most important, and so is your roommate's need to not be homeless. Ultimately, you are the property owner, and the decision is yours to make. Joe's stay wasn't intended to be permanent, anyway, so maybe the thought of living with a woman he's not married to will help him with his efforts into finding his own place.", "You're getting a lot of amateur legal advice here.
