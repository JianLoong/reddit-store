I've watched my sister in law's cat for 3 years because she was deploying a lot, and she gave us about $100 a month to cover pet insurance and food. That's just for a cat.

If costs were higher over the year and payments were incremental, he'd just be able to ask for additional costs as time went on", "It should be either a downpayment or broken up as part of a larger payment schedule. Pets are like kids, you can't know for sure how much they'll need until they do\n\nI think OP should either agree or not agree without getting the kids involved in the conversation or trying to own the dog. If he agrees, he should make a reasonable agreement about payment", "OP gave a [vague answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112evlp/aita_for_insisting_that_my_brother_choose_between/j8jph09/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) too, so i\u2019m not sure either", "That\u2019s just not true. Obviously unforeseen expenses are unforeseen! But a ton of this budget is knowable. In a dog\u2019s healthiest mid life year he will need food, grooming (this is not optional as poodle mixes will get matted and can and DO get their paws stuck in mats rendering them paralyzed until a human intervenes), flea and heart worm meds, vaccines, and possibly a dental depending on when the last one was done. None of those are optional although sometimes you can delay a dental depending on the situation. A dental alone can range between $200 if you\u2019re in a cheap market and they\u2019re willing to do a non anesthetic because they know your dog is super docile (rare and hard to find) and $1400+ if they have to be knocked out. Could even be more if they insist on blood work before, and many do. Flea and heart worm I\u2019m not as sure because my poodle mix is much smaller but that\u2019s probably easily another $400 with coupons, and grooming varies wildly but probably $60-100 and you can stretch it out to maybe every 8 weeks if you brush consistently. Vaccines depend on whether he\u2019s using a three yr rabies shot or annual, but that\u2019s another few hundred. That\u2019s in a year the dog doesn\u2019t get sick or injured. And you haven\u2019t fed the dog yet."]}
