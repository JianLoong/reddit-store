STAT.", "#I am a therapist,\n\n you don't need reddit, you need family discussion, introspection, boundaries, and time. Possibly even family therapy.\n\nYou cant just punish two out of 3 people who are responsable for a fight, and reward the 3rd with special bonding time with you and ice cream while the others are stuck in the bus.\n\nYou see things in her perspective and are showing her empathy, and i applaud you for that, but have you tried to  think about how your wife and other kids might feel ? \n\nHaving a stranger invading their home? Disrupting the life they knew? Maybe, in their perspective, stealing you away from them ? Having to share their things AND dad ? Having to look at your daughter who was concieved either when your wife was pregnant with Bella or just shortly after ?\n\nYou need to consider they might feel abandoned, not good enough compared to this new sibling you are favoritising, and/or replaced. I am not diagnosing anything, i am not saying that IS how they feel, but you need to consider that it MIGHT be. You need to talk to them. You need to ASK THEM how they feel.\n\n Yall need to acknowledge each other, validate all feelings.\n\nThe question here is how are you going to become a family, not if you are the asshole or not.\n\nBut in case you were wondering, yup you are. You're trying to manage eva, but you are forgetting your 2 other kids and wife are also going through changes and you're not doing anything to ease them into it, it seems.\n\nEdit grammar and thanks for the award <3", "INFO: How much time have you and your family spent with Eva before she had to move in with you? Did the kids get along then? Did Eva visit with you? Where did she sleep?\n\nThe thing is, your kids are a mess right now! Eva has lost her mom (primary parent) and Owen and Bella lost their privacy. You put teenagers that are used to have their own space in shared bedrooms. That was bound NOT to work! The kids, ALL OF THEM, need to get their personal space. Is there anything you can do with your current living situation that would get all the kids their own room? Again, where did Eva sleep when she visited with you? Did she not have her own space in your house?

Eva's most of all. Her mom died, she was uprooted, and she's now living with a father she doesn't know particularly well and half siblings who hate her.\n\n\nYour wife and your other two kids suddenly have this teenager living with them that's a reminder of a really rough patch in which you and your wife were broken up, and their lives are being majorly altered as well. It causes logistic and financial changes. \n\n\nI don't think there is any ideal way to deal with it. Definitely get Eva into therapy, and hopefully the others as well. Hope that time, and not forcing them, they will develop a better relationship.", "..I'm not being as ass but maybe get Eva into counseling and sit down and talk to Bella and Owen. Just try to make them ignore her or something, this may seem cruel but when the situation is this volatile, it's better. Maybe get Owen a car and let him and Bella drive to school. \n\nINFO: do you still spend time with Owen and Bella as you do with Eva?", "YTA.\n\nThis is not how you do it.  I get your motivations, and I agree things are hard for Eva, but things are also hard for Own and Bella as well.  They suddenly have another sibling who is taking a parent's time away from them and constantly siding against them.  They don't understand how hard it is for Eva to have lost all she's lost, and her mean comments that upset them only add to the conflict between them.  Eva has a lot of reasons to act up, but so do Bella and Owen.  You also don't know what kind of crap they may be dealing with at school.  There are lots of hard things in life besides losing a parent.\n\nWhy doesn't Owen drive him and Bella to school?  Does he not have a vehicle to do so?  You literally have 3 teenagers on hand, and one is old enough to be driving the oldest to school by himself. You also don't know now what they'd be dealing with on the bus.\n\nYour wife doesn't like to see her kids getting the short end of the stick.  I also didn't see any mention of therapy or counseling for the family to deal with these massive changes.  This should have been done immediately.  Eva needs to process the loss of her mother, and the other kids need to process this new family dynamic of having a new grieving sibling in their home.\n\nNow your family is split apart and you're wondering if you're an AH. When you put one member of the family above all else, it's GONNA cause massive problems.  You should care about all of your kids equally, and be having one on one time with ALL of them. Maybe get Eva involved in an extracurricular where she can make some new friends, away from her angry siblings who already have established friend groups. If Eva could carpool with a friend, or if you put all 3 kids on the bus, maybe you would have had some better results.   Or you could have taken turns taking one kid to school each day so you get some quality time with each one of them, but what you've been doing obviously isn't working and it's only been 2 months.   A therapist could be invaluable to offering helpful ideas that keep the best interests of ALL 3 KIDS in mind rather than just the one.\n\nNow your 2 oldest feel like they're losing you, even though you're still alive, they probably feel rejected by you.  Was that what you wanted?", "So daughter didn\u2019t want to share a room with her half sister so you made daughter share a room with brother and gave daughters room to half sister?

You\u2019ve admitted that Eva dishes it out as well but you\u2019ve chosen to ignore her behavior and only punish the other two. You have done everything in your power to ensure these children never get along and have a sibling bond with Eva. Bella being a few months older than Eva does not mean she should be more mature and is more responsible for their fights.

Having to suddenly share your home with a \u201cstranger\u201d is NOWHERE near as traumatic as losing your mother & uprooting your life to live with people that seem to hate you. \n\nSure Owen and Bella seem to be struggling with the adjustment, but they\u2019re entitled and pretty horrible if they can\u2019t understand why they should stop instigating fights with their half-sister. Your wife seems unsupportive and seems to resent Eva as well. \n\nYou need family counseling and therapy for Eva.", "No judgement, but I highly suggest family therapy.\n\nMaybe try asking each family member individually for their input on possible solutions. Ask something like this: \n\nClearly things aren't working well in this family, no one is happy. What do you think would help resolve some of the issues we're having? \n\nThen Listen. Don't interrupt, listen to understand by asking clarifying/probing questions. A family therapist would help greatly with this. \n\nI hope your family can work towards a resolution that works for everyone. \ud83d\udc9a", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously this is new for you too, but family counselling is definitely advisable. This is hard stuff to navigate and an impartial (professional) can help. Some counsellors work on a sliding scale if cost is an issue and your kids' school might have some resources. In the meantime, start reading all you can on blended families and resources for foster parents bringing children into the home with kids; many of the same things will apply. \n\nUprooting a 15 year old from her room and making an older brother and sister share is also a big deal, even if it might not seem like it should be. Eva's obviously grieving but showing her favoritism is going to harm your relationship with Owen and Bella and won't help Eva in the long run. You and your wife are going to have to work as a team to come up with some solutions, but I think you have to acknowledge how hard this must be for them too. I'm sure that as another poster mentioned this is a reminder of a difficult time for them. Teenagers are tough, I get that, but I think this situation requires skills that most people just don't have innately.

Start finding solutions probably with therapy for ALL of you. Yes Eva lost her mum and no one disputes its a tough situation .. but jeezz if ever there was guilt giving it is you. \nWhen last did you treat your other kids with one on one time? Why does is it seem Eva was not part of your family before? \nYou need to fix the situation and yes be fair to everyone ..", "NAH\n\n\nUnless you dealt with a situation like this please stop giving OP bad advice or grief over it.\n\nHer Mom died. You don't get to have long drawn out convos and work towards a solution to make everyone happy. That isn't the reality of what happens. \n\nKeep talking to the kids. Your two oldest are hurt and threaten by Eva. They need your reassurance. Everyone should be in therapy. Individual and group family. This will help them process and discuss their issues without fighting. Eva needs time to heal from her trauma.\n\n As far as the bedroom... That's on Bella. She needs to understand that the living situation is changing and make  a choice. Eva or Owen. Moving isn't an option right now. You gave her chance and she refused to act respectfully. So next step is for her and Owen to share. If she doesn't like it then she needs to reconsider her attitude.\n\nYour wife is a huge part of the problem. You said that Eva hasn't really interacted with your other kids. You never brought them with you to visit her for 14 years. The three of them treat Eva as your cheater child. I don't care if you were separated and didn't cheat. Eva exists. And it's very obvious your wife and other children hate her and resent her. I can only imagine what she's been telling your kids over the years about the \"other child\". The fact that she left with your kids and said she's not coming back till they are all treated equally is a huge red flag. Eva isn't going anywhere. They all have issues but your older two have been acting out and lashing out twice as much as her. The fact that your wife doesn't want to acknowledge their bad behavior and issues is concerning.\n\nLet the wife and kids stay away for now then. I'm assuming they are happier and not fighting anymore?? How about at school?? Get everyone in therapy first. Workout the immediate anger issues. See if they are ready to return back home or wish to stay away.\n\nNo matter what Eva is going to need you. And if your wife and kids can't come to terms with that-- then yes you will have to make some very hard choices. At the end of the day Eva only has you for a support system. Don't throw away your child to appease your wife and other kids. You already made that option acceptable and okay when you kept Eva isolated from your family. They need to learn to accept her finally.", "YTA, it's a tough situation, yes,  but the way you're handling it is going to lead to a lot of resentment. \n\nAlso, why didn't you take extra care not to get your girlfriend pregnant when you already had a baby on the way.", "You are clearly the asshole......showing favoritism for one child is hardly going to lessen the very obvious resentment that your other daughter m/children have, frankly it'll widen it and if you don't realise that then you're a fool.

It is obvious to me that the problem is your wife. First, it is weird that people comparing and saying that losing mother and moving to another city is the same as having a new sibling at home. No doubt Eva has bigger problems and her step siblings try to make life hell for her. Good for Eva to defend herself. She is the one who needs protection. You did right after warning Owen and Bella and they didn't care. Repeating again that the problem is your wife. Leaving home with children shows that she favorites her children and maybe hates Eva. I think she encourages her children against Eva. Clearly, it is either them or Eva. Compensating your wife will ruin Eva's life. I would not do anything for them to come home. You must protect who needs protection, not the unfair ones.", "YTA \n\nYou admit that Eva is instigating fights yet she is the only one not being punished.

Owen, Bella,and your wife seem to be terribly unsympathetic toward her.\n\nYou need some serious family counseling.", "YTA big time.  The two older ones should NOT be sharing a room they both need their own space.  Maybe it\u2019s time to consider a new house?  Maybe you and your wife give up the master bedroom and the girls can have it - you can make a divider for them and you suck it up and have a smaller room. Build an extension.  Whatever you do, Bella should not end up sharing with her adult brother. \n\nIt sounds like every time there is a problem, somehow Eva gets rewarded.  She gets her own room. She gets chauffeured around. Now she gets you after you alienated the two kids you lived with for years have left.  If you don\u2019t stop this crap now, you will create a monster  - if you haven\u2019t already - I\u2019m guessing she starts way more than 30% of the problems because she knows now that she will get rewarded. You just won\u2019t see it.\n\nEva needs therapy, clearly.  But you have three kids not one.  Stop favoring Eva or suffer the consequences.", " YTA by your own actions you only seem to care about Eva and not your other two children. There are so many ways you are solely responsible for this entire mess. 1. Your visitation with Eva should have primarily with your entire family not just you.

Again, that\u2019s on you. 3. You are not holding Eva accountable for her actions only your other two. Just because she is grieving doesn\u2019t give her a pass for poor behavior. Your teaching her that you will always side with her over her half siblings. That\u2019s all on you. 4. You kicked your older daughter out of her bedroom, that\u2019s always been hers, sided with Eva once again, showing your favoritism. Teenage brother/sister CAN NOT SHARE A BEDROOM!!! What in the world were you thinking?!?! This is all in you. \n\nI agree with your wife. She is protecting her children as she should because their father is refusing to and is actively hurting them. At this point, the situation is too far gone. You and Eva should move out and find an other living arrangements so your wife and other children can move back in. With the help of family therapy, maybe in the future your can all be together, but if you actually care even an ounce for your older 2 you and Eva will leave. Hopefully, after you move out you will spend some one on one time with your older two, but I won\u2019t hold my breath. You seem to be a pretty crappy dad.", "NTA.

If all the kids are behaving badly, why are two children stuck on the bus while ones gets a ride and ice cream?\n3. If Eva needs special attention- which is understandable- why are you not talking to your other children about that so they feel comforted and supported. \n4. Eva needs therapy and a stable home, not ice cream and her own room. Do the hard work, not just the easy stuff. \n\nYou are choosing Eva at every turn, when you don't need to! YOU are creating a divide in the family by your actions and decisions. Your children will never forgive or forget for what you are doing now, so you better get it together quick.", "Yta- treat your kids equally. \n\nIs Eva in therapy!!??? \n\nHave you thought about how bella and Owen felt about having another kid in their house!!??\n\nDid they meet each other prior to this??? \n\nThat could cause their fighting. It's natural for siblings to fight. Ofc they're gonna get mad when your clearly showing more to Eva. Cause she lost her mom?? she needs therapy.", "YTA", "YTA, Look, I get what Eva had to go through, but that is no excuse of her to be mean to her siblings! You have to teach all three of them how to treat others respect and you don\u2019t encourage bad behavior from either of them", "This sounds slightly made up. If it\u2019s not I apologise and get off Reddit and make an appointment with a professional family therapist.", "They\u2019re kids, you\u2019re the adult and your family needs some intervention to sort all of this out.

You need to talk to them more and encourage them to be more compassionate. They may never really like Eva, but they can be decent humans. \n\nYour wife isn't doing much to help. Maybe that's a discussion you need to have too, because if that's how she's behaving, it's no wonder her kids are bullying Eva. \n\nGet counselling for the family, for the kids so they all feel heard and for yourself to help you navigate this new situation. YWBTA if you don't.", "YTA\n\nJust say you have a favourite. Also the 14 year old seems to be getting all the benefits of fighting with the siblings. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s instigating fights knowing you will take her side and take another privilege away from them. \n\nAlso why are you making the son and daughter share a room while she gets her own?\n\n\nEdit\n\nYou all need therapy", "YTA \n\nOP, my died when I was 11, I lived with family that I hadn\u2019t lived with before and I was suffering. \n\nI was certainly given leeway, but not just to act however I wanted, whenever I wanted, I was also in grief counselling to help me understand and process my emotions. \n\nY\u2019all need to to family therapy, have Eva in grief counselling and figure out how to get your kids their own bedrooms pronto.", "You are not an a-hole.  You are trying to navigate a very difficult situation with young people who do not seem to have compassion for what their half-sister is going through.  That is not necessarily unusual, and their life, too, has been altered, but it is disappointing that they can't muster some sympathy for a child younger than them, who has lost both her mother, friends, home and the familiarity of her old life.\n\nWhat is a bit more worrisome is your wife--an adult--who doesn't appear to have a lot of compassion.\n\nI would recommend family and individual counseling (where warranted) for this situation.  Having a third-party, impartial professional hear all sides of the issues of this new, blended family living together will take the pressure off of you to be the one to \"fix\" everything.  In fact, if a professional is the one to point out the lack of compassion . . . to brainstorm ideas to resolve issues . . . along with their consequences, and you and your wife act as a united front to implement those ideas . . . you are not the bad guy.\n\nDon't assume the costs are prohibitive, please.  A lot of health plans include mental health counseling.  There are many charities that provide it for free or reduced rate.  When you go, if the therapist is not helping, it could be that you just got a bad fit or a bad one, so try again.  Find someone else.  Getting recommendations beforehand is always beneficial.  Best of luck.", "OP is failing to see that while Eva losing her mother is devastating and tragic, Owen and Bella also have to adjust to major disruptions to their lives.

In no part of your story have you mentioned that Eva is actively engaged in any form of grief counseling or that you have taken any significant steps as helping to ease the blending process with your older kids. You simply dropped Eva into your situation with \u201csurprise! Here\u2019s a new person, deal with it\u201d and then seem to blame the older kids when they react badly to sudden change.\n\nLook, blending family\u2019s is REALLY difficult and requires both a lot of patience and a delicate touch. Making snap decisions like switching up rooms or changing routines is never going to work and only makes waves, causes stress, and absolutely breeds resentment.\n\nYou are overcompensating for Eva given her situation at the expense of your older children and you are blaming them (the older children) without considering some things:\n\n1. Until now Eva has been an only child so she has no idea about having to share personal space with others. She will likely come across as selfish, standoffish, and territorial because of this. THAT alone could be the cause of fighting even if Eva says nothing.\n\n2. Your older children have a \u201cstatus quo\u201d in your home that has been completely shattered and they have been given no time to adjust before you started making rapid changes\n\n3. You have been reacting instead of acting here. Where you could have been proactive and trying to smooth this transition for everyone, you have just simply mixed chemicals and been shocked when they explode and now you are putting out fires.\n\n4. Your feeling that Eva needs more isn\u2019t unnecessarily wrong given her mothers passing, but you have neglected everyone else by favoring her which only bolsters the negative environment. \n\nI have a strong feeling that you have created a two family dynamic here (since your wife is hardly mentioned). There is your wife and older kids, and you and Eva. That dynamic is not going to work.\n\nYou need family therapy immediately. You need to work on communication, boundaries, and inter connectivity.

It's not a punishment for Owen and Bella to share a room it's a consequence of all their actions.  Bella, Owen, and Eva are old enough to realize that constantly fighting would not work out for any of them.

Set up a barrier in whichever bedroom is largest and move your daughter back in with Eva.  Apologize to Bella as having her share with her older brother was inappropriate.  Alternatively,  if you have a dining room that you can convert to a bedroom do that. Call your wife and admit you don't have the answers and that you want to try family therapy.

She is at best ignoring the problem, at worst encouraging her children in their behaviour. And offering no kind welcome to a child who has lost her mother, home, school, friends. How would she feel if something happened to her and their stepmother treated her kids like this? She\u2019d be horrified that he didn\u2019t leave this woman who isn\u2019t treating her children with some kindness.\n\nOwen and Bella have two parents to care for them. Eva has one. And yes, OP is favouring Eva to *try balancing it out.*\n\nI agree with the others that they need therapy. But the older two need to learn some empathy, not be coddled. Eva has been exposed to how shitty the world can be, on a far greater scale than they have.", "OP flew across the country once a month to see Eva, that expence is now gone so there should be some extra money too use differently. Of course arrangements can be made in very different ways. Can the rooms be used differently? Sometimes the parents have a large master bedroom while the kids' rooms are smaller. Maybe a room swap could be done and a proper divider could be put up in the largest room. OP needs to talk to his wife and they need to decide together what will be the best move for the whole family.\n\nThese kids don't know each other and are now in direct competition with each other. Both in physical space but also when it comes to time with OP. If the kids ever are going to have a proper relationship with each other these issues need to be addressed now.", "He could move into the living room with his wife and let one of the kids have the master. \n\nKids need privacy and spend way more time in their rooms, specially as teenagers. Specially when they have been forced in a situation like this. \n\nHis son is 17 and likely goes to college soon so the situation should relax. \n\nMaybe they also find a similar sized home, but with a better layout (more rooms). Or maybe they can alter the living room in a way to allow a separate small bedroom and do the work himself for cheap ... \n\nMaybe any room in the house (bedrooms or living room) is big enough to split in two and do it yourself for little money. Or maybe there's a dining room or a nook that can be temporary the parents bedroom. \n\nSOMETHING can always be done.", "Yes you can and you should because otherwise she's going learn that she can get away with bad behavior just by bringing up her dead mom. You're not helping her by letting her purposely say horrible things to her half siblings without consequences and rewarding her instead.  Grieving isn't an excuse to behave badly.", "Sorry, you can and should expect more from her. By allowing bad behaviour you are making a rod for your own back. When can you start to expect more from her? A year from now, 5 years, 10? You need to treat all 3 of your children equally, you\u2019re telling one that a horrible thing can happen and she can be a little brat. You\u2019re then telling the other two that their world can be turned completely upside down but they have to just accept it and be punished while their sibling (who has behaved equally badly) gets daddy time and ice cream while they get the bus?!?!", "neither can you from Bella who had her father bring in a reminder of a time when her parents were split and expect her to give up her life for Eva", "I suddenly lost my mum at 15, I didn\u2019t take it out on other people. Well it\u2019s sad for your daughter, you are enabling her by using her mothers passing as an excuse. Every time she does something wrong are you going to use that as the reason?\n\nAll children need to be spoken to about their behaviour not just the oldest two children.\n\nNot sure where you live but in my country, a male and sister sibling aren\u2019t meant to share the same room as soon as one of them turns 10. \n\nMy best guy friend hasn\u2019t spoke to his dad since he was 18. When he was 16 his dad moved in his 14 year old son from an ex girlfriend and made my friend share his room with his half brother. His dad treated his half brother a lot better and also took his side in arguments. \n\nWhen my friend was 17, he started planning on how to move out. The day he turn 18, he came to my house at 1am with his clothes, he stayed for a while, my dad made up a room for him and my friend then left when he got onto his own two feet. He spends every Christmas with us now and my dad treats him like a son. My dad always thought his dad was a wanker. \n\nHis dad never found out about this. It\u2019s been 6 years now and his dad still tries to contact him but my friend refuses to talk to him\n\nDon\u2019t be my friends dad and talk to your children and treat them fairly", "Yes you can. And if you don\u2019t your child will be a full nightmare (more than she is already). Depression is not an excuse to be an AH. And if you don\u2019t check that now your daughter will only have dad around because no one would want to deal with her \n\nYTA all your kids need therapy. And everyone needs family therapy", "You\u2019re acting like your other two kids aren\u2019t also experiencing an extreme change. \n\nYour 15 yo old just lost her room and they way you\u2019re treating your kids it sounds like they (and your wife) feel they\u2019re losing their dad.\n\nYTA\n\nyou have three children, they all need you right now", "I agree. If OP can't give each kid their own space, even if it's part of a living area sectioned off or giving up their own space, then they shouldn't have taken Eva in. OP has a responsibility to his older kids that he seems to have totally forgotten. Yes, Eva's mom died, which is very sad. But bringing her into a situation that has her being resented by every other member of the household isn't healthy either.", "We're you not paying child support for Eva?", "why are you so sarcastic and defensive in all of your replies? If you didn\u2019t want to hear from people, then you shouldn\u2019t have posted here", "Do you have a living room with a couch? Or an area you can 'put a curtain' across? You don't need to get another room to make an extra space. If you didn't want a judgement or advice why bother posting here?", "You came to Reddit for advice, don\u2019t get mad at me when I give you it \ud83e\udd23", "Idk man you maybe shouldnt have 3 kids then", "Do you own your home? Have a basement and good credit? If the answer is yes suck it up and if legally possible finish the basement and give it to your son. Otherwise from the sound of it you\u2019re gonna be divorced a second time and selling that house to live in a tiny apartment", "You do realize how inappropriate this response is? You don\u2019t come somewhere ASKING everyone to judge you then argue with that judgement and get nasty. That only makes you double the asshole", "This!", "The fact she doesn\u2019t know your wife or your other two kids and barely knows you that\u2019s not unreasonable and I don\u2019t blame your wife one bit for not wanting her to stay especially with how you\u2019re acting. It sounds like you\u2019re tossing your wife and other kids away. Plus having Eva there has caused massive disruptions and made everyone miserable so instead of driving your wife and other kids away fix it. It\u2019s awful that Eva lost her mom but stop coddling her. That\u2019s what you\u2019re doing you\u2019re not cutting her slack. Treat all your children fairly. Stop giving Eva special treatment. She misbehaves punish her like you would the other kids. And for God sakes get them all into counseling. You\u2019re an awful father op\n\nEdit to add: you don\u2019t want them to argue over stupid crap then punish ever participant. You can\u2019t have a one sided argument that\u2019s just yelling into the void", "Gonna reserve judgement on this one as you are put a very difficult situation. You have a child that is grieving, made to move cities and is clearly unwelcome in their new environment. And then you have 2 kids that are losing their father (AGAIN, and to the same \"other\" family) and their safe space (the room and car ride), getting punishments while seeing the other party get ice cream and fun time with dad. It is a very difficult task to balance this out and there it would be very difficult to make everyone happy.\n\nI am afraid that the way you are handling this will make you gain 1 kid and lose the other two. So just be ready for that.", "I responded to some of your other comments but reading this one\u2026dude, why are you even on Reddit?\n\nYour wife is gone. She took her two kids to her family\u2019s house and wants you to send Eva (someone you chose to keep as a stranger to your wife and other kids) to live somewhere else and isn\u2019t coming back until you stop the favoritism. \n\nWhat do you think you\u2019ll gain from Reddit? Use the internet to find a divorce lawyer and a therapist because your wife has already left. You\u2019re apparently not willing to budge. Looks like it\u2019s you and Eva now.", "100%!", "I never said she gets away without consequence. She gets punished if she starts a fight", "To be clear they were the ones starting the car fights.\n\nShe lost her mom less than 2 months ago,  I don't know when the time is but its not now", "Yes losing you mom and having a new sibling are equal", "What the hell are you talking about? OP needs to work on a solution, but the solution is not to abandon the child he's responsible for because his other kids don't like the situation.", "Er, what the fuck? You think that a better solution than *making two siblings share a room* would be for OP to abandon one of his children? Reddit can be a little deranged sometimes, but that is, frankly, the most batshit suggestion I've ever heard.\n\nLike, yes, OP is very clearly the asshole, but for not sorting out a bit of family therapy, and fostering a relationship between his three kids, not for accepting his motherless child into the family home.", "OP knows they\u2019re wrong and an AH but is incapable of admitting fault because then they have to realize they\u2019re an enabler", "Dumbass", "But he said that he is punishing her if she is in the wrong. I don\u2019t understand some of this comments. In all other aitas people say that kids come first and spouse second. And now this 14 year old girl is villain. What would you recommend in this situation? Send his daugher away? And if where? And how would you resolve situation with rooms? Ok get bigher house. But if they don\u2019t have money for that? Than what? Eva has been here for 14 years and OP\u2019s wife knew that. It seems that OP\u2019s wife didn\u2019t want to know Eva and now she doesn\u2019t want her in their house. Can you imagine live in this enviroment? I don\u2019t blame OP that he is trying to be parent to her and be on her side when she doesn\u2019t have anyone and everybody is against her.", "Also (I just had a hot shower and was musing on this subject) can we all remember that OP\u2019s wife CHOSE TO DATE A MAN WITH CHILDREN. The fact that two out of three are hers is irrelevant. There\u2019s an unspoken understanding that if you date/marry a single parent and something happens to their ex, your partner is going to be responsible for the child(ren). And if they wouldn\u2019t step up and do that but instead ship their child off to live with relatives, then you shouldn\u2019t touch them with a barge pole.\n\nPeople in the comments acting like he cheated and moved the affair partner\u2019s child in. SMH.", "Has she started any of the fights?", "How is ice cream and a solo ride home a punishment?", "The time needs to be now. You have stated previously that she starts 30% of the arguments. Seems to be a 3 way split, all 3 need to be punished equally, you are showing favouritism (even if you don\u2019t mean to). Please stop justifying and realise that while one has absolutely gone through something no child should have to, the others are going through a huge change because of it and also need compassion. The same behaviour requires the same punishment or your other two children will 100% resent you and their half sibling and you will eventually lose them", "Start as you mean to continue. Now is the time. Or would you rather she have another shocking wake-up call once (if) you stop letting her do as she pleases?", "The time is always the present, the world doesn\u2019t stop for grief and grief never leaves you so you learn to cope and move forward.", "Listen,  her life is out of control right now.  She is feeling insecure.  Kids need boundaries and rules and structure to feel secure.  Her acting out is testing to see what those boundaries are. She will get worse not better the more you indulge her.  Set rules that apply equally to all three and enforce them equally.   You're treating her like an honored guest.  Don't.  Guests can be kicked out at any time. Treat her like your family.  It will lessen the tension between your kids AND make her feel more secure .", "Please don't listen to all these comments, I can't believe how the comments section is being so cruel to a child who has lost her mother.\n\nYour daughter's life has been turned upside down.", "If it doesn\u2019t start now then she will expect this all the time and will make it harder in the future", "This right here is why YTA OP.\n\nYou\u2019re comparing the shitty situation your whole family is in and essentially deciding that because Eva\u2019s situation is \u201cworse\u201d that her feelings on this entire thing are the only ones that matter.\n\nObviously losing her mother is a huge change and an awful thing to happen. But this is also a HUGE change for your other children and you need to acknowledge that. Your job as a parent is to support all your children through their struggles, not just pick one and leave the rest out to dry. \n\nI 100% agree with all the advice given about going to therapy. I would add that you need to step up as a parent and instead of just punishing your kids for reacting poorly to a bad situation, you need to sit down with them and talk this out. Let them air their grievances and talk about what you can do as a family to move forward and make Eva feel at home while also recognizing the huge change this is for them.\n\nYou hardly mention your wife in this post so I have to wonder, how is she reacting to Eva, a reminder of your past without her, being in your lives. She definitely needs to also step up by your side to handle this and welcome Eva if this is at all going to work.", "One has nothing to do with the other. And unless there was some connection between Eva and your older kids, they aren't gaining a sibling. They are getting an unwelcome roommate. And your actions aren't endearing her to your older kids. They aren't putting you in the best light either, since you've made it clear that you will favor Eva.", "Just pointing it out here: soon you will have lost two of your children and your wife.", "OP is not fostering a relationship between his kids. He's causing animosity between them. \n\nIf OP had to evict his daughter from her own room due to fighting, there's a problem. Shoving her in with her older brother isn't going to foster feelings of friendship with the new sibling. With either older sibling. OP set them up to fail by not trying to set up a space for the new sibling. \n\nI would have highly resented being forced to share my space with a stranger at 15. Even just being in close proximity to my siblings at that age occasionally ended in bloodshed. \n\nOP is going about integrating his youngest very poorly in my opinion. It's not *sharing a room* that's the real problem. It's 'share your room with this upset stranger for the foreseeable future'. Followed by 'well you guys fight too much, so you have to give up you space'.", "Nope I don\u2019t think Eva is the villain, I think op is. For the room situation if op has good credit and they have have a basement finish it. Heck do it in phases and offer it to the son with a promise that it will be done and will be solely his. And if they have a dining room put one of the girls in there for the time being. The wife does need to be flexible and help but op needs to stop expecting his older kids to be ok with any of this. If wife\u2019s been clear from the get go that Eva wasn\u2019t welcome then op is a massive idiot for bringing her into the house in the first place. You got me thinking did Eva even want to go with op in the first place..Op seems very selfish", "She starts about 30 percent of the fights, Owen and Bella start about 70 percent", "So have his other children\u2019s lives. At 14, regardless of the situation bad behaviour should not be tolerated, especially to the detriment of the other children within the home", "Seriously... That poor girl. And the other kids are serious ah! They are old enough to understand how terrible this is for her and just don't care... What the hell is wrong with them?", "I don't know why you're wasting any more words on OP. He thinks he's right and completely ignores valid points why he isn't right. OP, YTA.", "I totally agree with what you've said above and I too think he's an asshole for not fostering a relationship between his kids (realise the exact thrust of that sentence isn't totally clear - it is clearer said outloud by someone who knows what point they are trying to make!)\n\nBut you literally said \"If OP can't give each kid their own space ... then they shouldn't have taken Eva in\" which is, objectively, batshit, and would have been even more of an asshole moment than what he is currently doing.", "And how does she get punished?", "So they all equally start fights with each other. YTA\u2014I get that Eva is grieving but that doesn\u2019t give you a pass for showing blatant favoritism. Your wife was right to get your older two out of the house.", "How many of those fights are started because of your favoritism? It seems you've given Bella and Owen plenty of reasons to resent Eva.", "So you are letting her get away with it?", "So basically each one starts a fight 1/3 of the time.", "Upon reflection I wouldn't have said that. That's why posting before coffee is a bad idea. \n\nTaking Eva in is/was clearly the right thing. I just wish that OP gave Bella and Owen the same consideration he's giving Eva. They seem to be pushed to the side.", "With ice cream and a solo ride home.", "Oh, totally - I think the whole thing has been really badly handled. It's also not clear whether the kids knew each other before the ex's death, and if they didn't, that super hardens up my feelings that OP is an arsehole.  However, I do think that in a situation where all three kids are suddenly dealing with one or more extra siblings in their space, but one of them has just lost her mother and been forced to move schools, they are probably the one who needs the most help. \n\nI actually, on thinking further, suspect that OP's wife isn't helping matters. He only mentions her in the context of removing the older kids from the home (which I really don't think is going to help in the long term!). As she chose to go back to him after he'd had another kid, it is partly on her to be the best possible step mum - if she couldn't do that, she should have stayed away from him."]}
