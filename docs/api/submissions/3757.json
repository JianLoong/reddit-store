I also have another daughter Eva(14F)\n\n(Just to be clear(since I know everyone is gonna accuse me of cheating), my wife and I broke up when Bella wasn't born, we started dating again when she was 7 and married a year after that. I did NOT cheat)\n\nEva's mom had primary custody and they lived in another city until she passed away and Eva came to live with us about 2 months ago.\n\nThe kids don't get along at all. Owen and Bella have been pretty mean to Eva and she is not helping the situation either by saying things she knows will make them angry. At first we put a bed in Bella's bedroom for Eva but they kept fighting so much that we couldn't do this anymore so I gave the bedroom to Eva and told Bella she should share a bedroom with Owen. I put a curtain in the middle of bedroom so that they could both have some privacy but they were both mad at me.\n\nThe other problem is that I used to always bring all the kids back from school but they kept fighting in the car and I was worried about Eva because she is going through a very hard time so I had a talk with Owen and Bella and told them how hard it is for Eva to lose her mom and then go to another city to live with people who are like strangers to her and losing all her friends as a result. I told them unless they start being nicer to her they have to take the bus instead. Next day they had another fight in the car so I told them that's it, You are both going home with bus and I'm only taking Eva. The last week I've only been taking Eva and we started to get an ice cream or something else after school and spend some time together. Owen and Bella are angry and my wife thinks I'm an asshole and showing favoritism. Last night she went to her parents home and took both kids with her and said she'll be back after I start to treat them equally.\n\nEdit: I want to thank some of you for your very helpful and supportive comments\n\nI also need to add something else\n\nSome of the comments and messages that I got were just unbelievable, wtf is wrong with some of you?\n\nThere were some people who said I should have made Eva take the bus instead? Like who does that? \"Oh sweetheart I'm sorry you are getting bullied if You don't want to be bullied anymore get out and take the bus\" sounds good?\n\nSome poeple told me I should let her go and focus on my real family. Wtf is a real family? She is my CHILD. What more real than that?\n\nSome people told me they agree with my wife and I should send her to live with someone else. \"Sweetheart I'm sorry you lost your mom. Now you should lose your dad because who cares about you? I have more important matters\" sounds good?\n\nSome people gave me the very useful suggestion of buying a new home.

Disrupting the life they knew? Maybe, in their perspective, stealing you away from them ? Having to share their things AND dad ? Having to look at your daughter who was concieved either when your wife was pregnant with Bella or just shortly after ?\n\nYou need to consider they might feel abandoned, not good enough compared to this new sibling you are favoritising, and/or replaced. I am not saying that IS how they feel, but you need to consider that it MIGHT be. You need to talk to them. You need to ASK THEM how they feel.\n\n Yall need to acknowledge each other, validate all feelings.\n\nThe question here is how are you all going to become a family and what can you do to make it happen, not whether you are the asshole or not.\n\nBut in case you were wondering, yup you are.

You put teenagers that are used to have their own space in shared bedrooms. That was bound NOT to work! The kids, ALL OF THEM, need to get their personal space. Is there anything you can do with your current living situation that would get all the kids their own room? Again, where did Eva sleep when she visited with you?

Eva's most of all. Her mom died, she was uprooted, and she's now living with a father she doesn't know particularly well and half siblings who hate her.\n\n\nYour wife and your other two kids suddenly have this teenager living with them that's a reminder of a really rough patch in which you and your wife were broken up, and their lives are being majorly altered as well. It causes logistic and financial changes. \n\n\nI don't think there is any ideal way to deal with it. Definitely get Eva into therapy, and hopefully the others as well. Hope that time, and not forcing them, they will develop a better relationship.", "..I'm not being as ass but maybe get Eva into counseling and sit down and talk to Bella and Owen. Just try to make them ignore her or something, this may seem cruel but when the situation is this volatile, it's better. Maybe get Owen a car and let him and Bella drive to school. \n\nINFO: do you still spend time with Owen and Bella as you do with Eva?", "YTA.\n\nThis is not how you do it.  I get your motivations, and I agree things are hard for Eva, but things are also hard for Own and Bella as well.  They suddenly have another sibling who is taking a parent's time away from them and constantly siding against them.  They don't understand how hard it is for Eva to have lost all she's lost, and her mean comments that upset them only add to the conflict between them.  Eva has a lot of reasons to act up, but so do Bella and Owen.  You also don't know what kind of crap they may be dealing with at school.  There are lots of hard things in life besides losing a parent.\n\nWhy doesn't Owen drive him and Bella to school?  Does he not have a vehicle to do so?  You literally have 3 teenagers on hand, and one is old enough to be driving the oldest to school by himself. You also don't know now what they'd be dealing with on the bus.\n\nYour wife doesn't like to see her kids getting the short end of the stick.  I also didn't see any mention of therapy or counseling for the family to deal with these massive changes.  This should have been done immediately.  Eva needs to process the loss of her mother, and the other kids need to process this new family dynamic of having a new grieving sibling in their home.\n\nNow your family is split apart and you're wondering if you're an AH. When you put one member of the family above all else, it's GONNA cause massive problems.  You should care about all of your kids equally, and be having one on one time with ALL of them. Maybe get Eva involved in an extracurricular where she can make some new friends, away from her angry siblings who already have established friend groups. If Eva could carpool with a friend, or if you put all 3 kids on the bus, maybe you would have had some better results.   Or you could have taken turns taking one kid to school each day so you get some quality time with each one of them, but what you've been doing obviously isn't working and it's only been 2 months.   A therapist could be invaluable to offering helpful ideas that keep the best interests of ALL 3 KIDS in mind rather than just the one.\n\nNow your 2 oldest feel like they're losing you, even though you're still alive, they probably feel rejected by you.  Was that what you wanted?", "So daughter didn\u2019t want to share a room with her half sister so you made daughter share a room with brother and gave daughters room to half sister?

You\u2019ve admitted that Eva dishes it out as well but you\u2019ve chosen to ignore her behavior and only punish the other two. You have done everything in your power to ensure these children never get along and have a sibling bond with Eva.

Ask something like this: \n\nClearly things aren't working well in this family, no one is happy. What do you think would help resolve some of the issues we're having? \n\nThen Listen.

Obviously this is new for you too, but family counselling is definitely advisable. This is hard stuff to navigate and an impartial (professional) can help. Some counsellors work on a sliding scale if cost is an issue and your kids' school might have some resources. In the meantime, start reading all you can on blended families and resources for foster parents bringing children into the home with kids; many of the same things will apply. \n\nUprooting a 15 year old from her room and making an older brother and sister share is also a big deal, even if it might not seem like it should be. Eva's obviously grieving but showing her favoritism is going to harm your relationship with Owen and Bella and won't help Eva in the long run. You and your wife are going to have to work as a team to come up with some solutions, but I think you have to acknowledge how hard this must be for them too. I'm sure that as another poster mentioned this is a reminder of a difficult time for them. Teenagers are tough, I get that, but I think this situation requires skills that most people just don't have innately.

Start finding solutions probably with therapy for ALL of you. Yes Eva lost her mum and no one disputes its a tough situation .. but jeezz if ever there was guilt giving it is you. \nWhen last did you treat your other kids with one on one time? Why does is it seem Eva was not part of your family before? \nYou need to fix the situation and yes be fair to everyone ..", "NAH\n\n\nUnless you dealt with a situation like this please stop giving OP bad advice or grief over it.\n\nHer Mom died. You don't get to have long drawn out convos and work towards a solution to make everyone happy. That isn't the reality of what happens. \n\nKeep talking to the kids. Your two oldest are hurt and threaten by Eva. They need your reassurance. Everyone should be in therapy. Individual and group family. This will help them process and discuss their issues without fighting. Eva needs time to heal from her trauma.\n\n As far as the bedroom... That's on Bella. She needs to understand that the living situation is changing and make  a choice. Eva or Owen. Moving isn't an option right now. You gave her chance and she refused to act respectfully. So next step is for her and Owen to share. If she doesn't like it then she needs to reconsider her attitude.\n\nYour wife is a huge part of the problem. You said that Eva hasn't really interacted with your other kids. You never brought them with you to visit her for 14 years. The three of them treat Eva as your cheater child. I don't care if you were separated and didn't cheat. Eva exists. And it's very obvious your wife and other children hate her and resent her. I can only imagine what she's been telling your kids over the years about the \"other child\". The fact that she left with your kids and said she's not coming back till they are all treated equally is a huge red flag. Eva isn't going anywhere. They all have issues but your older two have been acting out and lashing out twice as much as her. The fact that your wife doesn't want to acknowledge their bad behavior and issues is concerning.\n\nLet the wife and kids stay away for now then. I'm assuming they are happier and not fighting anymore?? How about at school?? Get everyone in therapy first. Workout the immediate anger issues. See if they are ready to return back home or wish to stay away.\n\nNo matter what Eva is going to need you. And if your wife and kids can't come to terms with that-- then yes you will have to make some very hard choices. At the end of the day Eva only has you for a support system. Don't throw away your child to appease your wife and other kids. You already made that option acceptable and okay when you kept Eva isolated from your family. They need to learn to accept her finally.", "YTA, it's a tough situation, yes,  but the way you're handling it is going to lead to a lot of resentment. \n\nAlso, why didn't you take extra care not to get your girlfriend pregnant when you already had a baby on the way.", "You are clearly the asshole......showing favoritism for one child is hardly going to lessen the very obvious resentment that your other daughter m/children have, frankly it'll widen it and if you don't realise that then you're a fool.

It is obvious to me that the problem is your wife. First, it is weird that people comparing and saying that losing mother and moving to another city is the same as having a new sibling at home. No doubt Eva has bigger problems and her step siblings try to make life hell for her. Good for Eva to defend herself. She is the one who needs protection. You did right after warning Owen and Bella and they didn't care. Repeating again that the problem is your wife. Leaving home with children shows that she favorites her children and maybe hates Eva. I think she encourages her children against Eva. Clearly, it is either them or Eva. Compensating your wife will ruin Eva's life. I would not do anything for them to come home. You must protect who needs protection, not the unfair ones.", "YTA \n\nYou admit that Eva is instigating fights yet she is the only one not being punished.

I think this situation is hard for everybody in your household. I understand that you are trying for Eva\u2019s sake. She is the stranger in your house and it seems your family is against her.

Owen, Bella,and your wife seem to be terribly unsympathetic toward her.\n\nYou need some serious family counseling.", "YTA big time.  The two older ones should NOT be sharing a room they both need their own space.  Maybe it\u2019s time to consider a new house?  Maybe you and your wife give up the master bedroom and the girls can have it - you can make a divider for them and you suck it up and have a smaller room. Build an extension.  Whatever you do, Bella should not end up sharing with her adult brother. \n\nIt sounds like every time there is a problem, somehow Eva gets rewarded.  She gets her own room. She gets chauffeured around. Now she gets you after you alienated the two kids you lived with for years have left.  If you don\u2019t stop this crap now, you will create a monster  - if you haven\u2019t already - I\u2019m guessing she starts way more than 30% of the problems because she knows now that she will get rewarded. You just won\u2019t see it.\n\nEva needs therapy, clearly.  But you have three kids not one.  Stop favoring Eva or suffer the consequences.", " YTA by your own actions you only seem to care about Eva and not your other two children. There are so many ways you are solely responsible for this entire mess. 1. Your visitation with Eva should have primarily with your entire family not just you. Your wife and older two don\u2019t know her at all because you isolated them. That\u2019s on you 2. You haven\u2019t started anyone on therapy, grief, family, IC, nothing. Again, that\u2019s on you. 3. You are not holding Eva accountable for her actions only your other two. Just because she is grieving doesn\u2019t give her a pass for poor behavior. Your teaching her that you will always side with her over her half siblings. That\u2019s all on you. 4. You kicked your older daughter out of her bedroom, that\u2019s always been hers, sided with Eva once again, showing your favoritism. Teenage brother/sister CAN NOT SHARE A BEDROOM!!! What in the world were you thinking?!?! This is all in you. \n\nI agree with your wife. She is protecting her children as she should because their father is refusing to and is actively hurting them. At this point, the situation is too far gone. You and Eva should move out and find an other living arrangements so your wife and other children can move back in.

Your wife and 2 kids could lose you if you do what your wife wants and send Eva to her mother's family because your resentment will grow and you'll lose Eva because she'll feel unwanted.

We grew up together ( yes I know your kids didn't grow up together) but when we were 14 his mom died from cancer, and he came to live with us. We lived in a two bedroom trailer, the one bedroom had a wall down the middle to separate the room to give me and my little brother our own space, but when our cousin moved in, I was put on the floor in the living room, and he was given my side of the room.\n\nIt caused a lot of resentment, because I was pushed out, to make room for him. And like OP is doing, he was treated differently because he just lost him mom. So he got special treatment, wasn't punished for things, and so on,\n\nThis made things worse between us, and fights happened a lot. We eventually started getting along, because we were stuck in the situation, and worked things out. But it didn't help that one was being favored over the other.\n\nYes Eva lost her mom, and she is going through a tough time. But allowing her to get away with everything is not the answer. She needs to learn that she has fault in her actions as well.\n\nIf you allow her to continue to argue with her siblings, and then give her everything while punishing the other two, she is not going to learn that she needs to make effort too. \n\nYou should have put all three of them on the bus, not just the older two. She was a part of those arguments too, even if she didn't start them, she participated in them. Makes her just as guilty. So she should have been punished as well, and put on the bus. \n\nAs far as the room situation, I understand there is only so many rooms, but you don't say if there is a dining room, or a den in your home. If there is, close one off and make it a bedroom. Get a permit to build a room onto your home, and add a room. I am sure you were paying child support to Evas mom, and then the cost of flying out to visit once a month now has become free money that you can use to do some remodeling in the home to make extra room for the daughter you didn't see fit to introduce to your older kids at any point in their lives.\n\nYou definitely are going about this the wrong way. You need to set boundaries now, and treat all three kids the same. Because treating one better than the rest just because she lost her mom, is not going to do anything but make things worse on all of you in the long run. You are causing a lot of the issues between your kids. They see Eva getting rewarded for bad behavior, while they are punished.  That is making them hate her more. Everything they know has been upturned, all to accommodate one child.  At this point you will be lucky your wife does not divorce you and take your older two children away. And the older two children are old enough to make up their minds if they want to have visitation with you after mom divorces you. And from the sounds of things, they will not want anything to do with a father who favors one kid over them. \n\nIt is a shitty situation, that you are making it worse. They are all biologically your kids, and deserve to be treated the same. Their lives as they have known it has changed, and you are not considering their feelings in any of this, just because their parent didn't die, but they still have valid feelings too, and deserve to be treated the same as Eva", "ESH. The situation is hard and very shitty to be in for everyone but the kids especially! The older two are treating their half sister horribly and need actual consequences for it. Eva is also instigating a lot of it and also needs real consequences. It\u2019s terrible that she lost her mom and her life uprooted to a house where she doesn\u2019t feel welcomed, but that doesn\u2019t give her an excuse to be an ass either! This is hard as a parent to support but also punish both her and the older two. You all definitely need counseling ASAP!!! But the more you treat Eva with favoritism like you are, the more your older two resent you and her. It\u2019s damaging both relationships even further! I\u2019d also suggest a different alternative to the room situation! You move you oldest daughter into her brothers room after she\u2019s had her own room for years. How do you think that makes her feel? Her and Eva both need to try to get along better. Neither want to share a room with any other sibling which is fair. Can you create an alternative \u2026ex. Move you and your wife to the basement if it\u2019s finished/ or able to be finished. Something that will allow everyone to have their own space! Even if it means looking into moving! The whole family needs to sit down and discuss this and make a plan moving forward! I know your heart aches for Eva but you can\u2019t allow her to treat your other kids shitty, and vice versa. They all need to stop and at least be civil to each other. And if they aren\u2019t, they all need consequences.

In your case, this is complicated. \n\nAgain, I'm not sure why your wife lacks compassion for Eva and doesn't want her around, but regardless of her reasons, it's wrong to bring her into your home without your wife fully on board.

Eva's mother died, she moved away from her friends and school, to be with a family who clearly resents her (excluding OP and ONLY OP). She should not be starting fights, but she absolutely deserves some slack. Adults don't handle their parents deaths well- why TF would you expect a child to in this awful situation? And then throw her into a house where 3/4 of the population resents her existence... She does not need to be punished, she needs to feel safe and loved when her world just blew up. \n\n Wife didn't want to become a full time parent to a non-bio child, though frankly I think that when you marry someone who has another child you need to be aware that this is a possibility- how in the world does she not have ANY empathy for her step-daughter? Eva existed when they married so wife is an AH for being unwilling to accept her. She is not an AH for defending her own children and being unhappy with the situation, these are normal. \n\nOther 2 kids are AHs for lacking empathy for their half-sister, but not for being upset that their lives and home was just uprooted. It sucks to lose your safe space or share it with someone else. But what would have happened if they had a surprise pregnancy? Or a grandparent with dementia who needed to move in? If Dad lost his job and they had to downsize? Unforeseen circumstances that change living arrangements are not uncommon and while they have every right to be upset, they don't have the right to take it out on a child who just lost her mother. \n\nThey're old enough to understand that life isn't fair- and for anyone saying that Eva is too, you're right, I guarantee she knows that already what with her mother's sudden death looming over her. Her needs are more important than the rest of the family's wants, and that is what this fight stems from. Eva did not steal a safe space from her siblings, both still have the house they grew up in, the school and friends they have always known, and a mom who protects them (excluding OP bc they probably feel like that's lost atm, whether that's true or not). Their needs are still being met- safety and love are still there- it's just different from what they're used to and they feel threatened. Valid, but not an excuse for isolating Eva. \n\nOP is an AH for not ever implementing Eva into this family. Why do they not have a relationship? Did you ever have custody? Did you visit Eva? If not, why are you bringing her here now? Does she want to live with OP or is there family on Mom's side that would do better for her? Also AH for only having one on one time with Eva- your other kids need you too, OP. Take them for ice cream, let them tell you how much this sucks for them, do things solo with each of them (your wife too!). OP should also seek out government assistance, as it may help alleviate the financial strain of an additional child. Maybe if you paid less for groceries, you could help your 17yo save for a car or have some savings for renovations. Although, maybe that's moot bc 17 does not need to live there in less than a year- I am not suggesting kicking him out, I have no idea what his plans are after he reaches adulthood though and this may have been temporary regardless. \n\nY'all need therapy, every single one of you.

If not then definitely seek mediation and if that doesn\u2019t help then the only two choices left is to keep things as they are but split days where they can each have a school car ride. The last option is you might have to move out with Eva. That last option is harsh and definitely a last resort but it\u2019s looking like she\u2019s in a very toxic environment surrounded by people bar you that hate her.

You could\u2019ve just omitted it but it sounds like you\u2019re unilaterally making decisions that affect your entire family.

Does Eva deserve some empathy her 100% but there\u2019s empathy and there\u2019s enabling and guess which one you\u2019re doing. My suggestion family therapy for everyone and individual therapy for Eva. Also move Bella back into her and Eva\u2019s room and have a serious conversation on how they both need to treat each other better and sisters will fight so have patience with them both. Maybe give them each a 30m-1 hour window where they have private time in the room and the other is in the living room. Also either they get along or they ALL ride the bus; if there is someone just being an obvious bully to another then find an appropriate punishment but riffing the bus together might give them time to bond and Eva an opportunity to form friendships with fellow classmates.
