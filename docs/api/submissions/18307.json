The twist here is that Joe's wife, Sarah (25F), happens to be my ex-girlfriend from several years ago. We ended our relationship amicably and remained friends, but it has been a while since we last saw each other.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, I noticed Sarah sitting alone at one of the tables. Feeling nostalgic and wanting to catch up, I decided to approach her and strike up a conversation. We reminisced about old times, shared stories, and genuinely had a pleasant time reconnecting.\n\nHowever, as the night progressed, I started to notice some uncomfortable glances from Joe and a few other guests. It wasn't until later that I discovered some people had taken offense to me talking to Sarah, believing it was inappropriate and disrespectful to Joe on his wedding day.\n\nNow, I never had any romantic intentions or ulterior motives in approaching Sarah. I genuinely wanted to reconnect as friends and thought it would be a harmless conversation. However, it seems that some people interpreted it differently.\n\nWhen Joe found out about the situation, he was visibly upset and confronted me about it. He accused me of crossing boundaries and not respecting the significance of the day for him and his wife. I explained that I didn't mean any harm and that my intention was simply to catch up with Sarah as friends.\n\nSince then, things have become somewhat strained between Joe and me. Some of our mutual friends have taken sides, with some believing I was out of line for approaching Sarah, while others think it was blown out of proportion and that reconnecting with an ex as friends should be acceptable.\n\nAITA for talking to my friend's wife, who is also my ex, at their wedding? Should I have known better and avoided the situation altogether? Or was it a harmless interaction that has been blown out of proportion?\n\nMore context: I think he heard from others that I was \"flirting\" but I obviously wasn't. And yes I did try to explain that but not sure he believed me even though he has no reason to not trust me, like I said we're close friends so this is very random.", "created_utc": 1685204295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tbj5k/aita_for_talking_to_my_friends_wife_who_is_also/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not the asshole. Additionally, if the groom was uncomfortable with you talking to hisbwife....why invite you to the wedding?", "You are invited as a guest at a wedding... and you are supposed to not talk to the bride? Insanity and NTA.", "Ummmm so as his 'close friend' does he expect you to avoid his wife forever? Does he expect you to duck and hide at every event y'all are at? \n\nNonsense \n\nNTA", "NTA - this is weird, if he didn\u2019t want you talking to her, why did they invite you, were you just supposed to ignore her, are you supposed to ignore her every time you guys interact?", "NTA\n\nThey invited you to the wedding. Wouldn\u2019t it have been rude for you not to speak to the bride?  I\u2019m wondering how she feels about this.  If I was her I would be incredibly pissed at my new husband for implying that he didn\u2019t trust me enough to speak to an ex that I still consider a good enough friend to have at my wedding.", "NTA This is beyond immature. Like, is this high school?\n\nIf it's inappropriate for you to have a conversation with your ex, then you should not have been invited to her wedding. As long as the conversation didn't go on forever and it wasn't flirty, I don't see how there could be any problem. Plus, if it was inappropriate, why are you at fault, but not the married lady? Reads as treating women like property to me.\n\nAlso, why is this woman sitting alone at a table at her own wedding? What weird social situation is this?", "NTA. Your friend has some major insecurities.", "NTA, why even invite you if he's worried about all that?", "Huh? If you are one of J\u2019s closest friends, how is it you didn\u2019t socialize with him and his fianc\u00e9e regularly?", "NTA. They are acting like middle schoolers and you are acting like an adult. If he is jealous or insecure that\u2019s his baggage to get over.", "NTA: if he didn't want you at the wedding, you should not have been invited. If he invited you, it would be unreasonable for you to ignore the bride, to say nothing of being rude.", "NTA if J would be offended over something as simple as speaking to S, why did he invite you to the wedding? J obviously knows about your past with S and is okay with remaining friends so I don\u2019t see why this would be the time to suddenly get defensive. And J should\u2019ve been with S anyway so she wouldn\u2019t have to have a moment alone on her wedding day. Seems like J still has some issues with your past but he can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too. Maybe you should talk with him about it to smooth it over if you still value his friendship but NTA", "NTA.  Wait you were invited to a wedding and expected not to speak to the bride?!?  This is stupid.  If Joe is so nervous about your past relationship with the bride, why invite you?  Dude, drop him and move on.  Life is too short to waste it on fake drama!", "NTA and it sounds like they\u2019re all overreacting here and being unreasonable. You were speaking with the bride on her wedding day to one of your close friends. Joe sounds insecure of your past relationships with her, but that\u2019s his own issue to deal with. You did nothing wrong in my opinion and anyone telling you different are being ridiculous and unreasonable", "Why did he invite you if this was an issue?\n\nN T A.", "What the fuck? If you weren\u2019t allowed to talk to the bride, why were you invited? Also, why did the groom leave her side even for a split second?\n\nNTA", "INFO - Was it simply that you were talking with her?\n\nWhat was the conversation specifically about?", "NTA Also, if he felt that protective of her and the day is so significant...why was she all by herself?", "He's one of your closest friends but you haven't seen his fianc\u00e9, your ex, in a long time? Do you only do gender specific hangouts lol.\n\nNTA but very strange that you are so disconnected from your apparently super close friend that you're never around the fianc\u00e9. And that this super close friend would immediately jump to the conclusion that you were disrespecting him by chatting with his new wife.\n\nVery bizarre, and it doesn't seem like you're close at all.", "Weeeelll I don't know. INFO How long have you been talking to the bride?", "NTA. Since you say you were not flirting, then I can only assume this is some sort of sexist BS for anyone to be upset that you would talk to the bride.  Sarah is not Joe's property now that she is his wife. It was her wedding too so why couldn't or wouldn't you talk to her as one of her guests?  \n\nI would nip this in the bud and talk to both Joe and Sarah about what happened.  I am sure Sarah will back you up.  You want to assure Joe you consider them both friends and you don't want any weirdness because a couple of gossips at the wedding were trying to start some trouble between you, or knew of your ex-status with Sarah and couldn't appreciate that you are just friends at this point in your lives.", "NTA; Sarah decides who she talks to not Joe and not obviously not you. I notice the issue started woth Joe's friends pointing it out, not Sarah. It sounds like she either didn't mind or was happy to chat with her old friend.\n\nKinda feeling like your friend Joe has some jealousy issues and unresolved insecurities about your prior relationship to Sarah that he should have figured out before getting married.\n\nBut no, there's nothing wrong with being friends with your exes and if he didn't want you talking to Sarah he should have figured that out with her and not invited you to the wedding", "NAH   You should be able to catch up, but from your comments, it sounds like it was for an extended time.  An ex having an extended 30-minute convo with the bride is sort of in bad taste.", "INFO: How long did you talk to her for? 20min? An hour? \n\nYou said 'as the night progressed' which make me wonder if y'all were talking for a very long time? Which doesn't automatically make you TA, but should be a consideration.", "He's mad at you but not her? Also it seems she didn't think you crossed any boundaries or she would have told you.", "NTA.  Why did they even invite you to the wedding if jealousy was an issue?", "NTA. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have invited you to the *wedding* if simply *talking* to the bride was enough to piss him off.", "You spoke to the bride at her wedding? Who even does that? No one talks to the BRIDE at HER WEDDING, right? /s\n\nSorry dude, your friend is super insecure. NTA", " He\u2019s jealous and suspicious of his wife and his supposed good friend *on his wedding day?!?* That says a lot about the relationship right there \ud83d\ude11 NTA,OP. Try to be a good friend next year when they\u2019re dealing with the divorce,it\u2019ll be for the best.", "NTA.\n\nI'm astounded you managed to talk to the bride alone long enough for anyone to notice or care.  The bride and groom are generally swarmed at weddings.", "Youre invited To a Wedding and people expect from you To ignore the bride? \n\nImaging at the day swore Trust To each Others Till death and at the same time beim Jealous because you talked?", "\"As the night progressed...\" How long were you talking to her for. Sounds like you were totally monopolising the bride which is really not on. A 5 minute chat and then walking away would have been appropriate. YTA", "YTA it sounds like you were talking to her for a significant length of time.\n\nDo you really need it explaining to you that you don't monopolise the bride on her wedding day to talk about your past relationship?\n\nNot really sure why nobody interrupted.", "Guy court convened.  \n\nI was headed to the beach and this dropped on my desk.  SMH.  \n\nThe court rules this was a total dick move, but you know that.    The court doesn't care if you sat there and counted to 1000.  You need to read the entire guy code back to front ffs.  Get it out of your sock draw and memorize it.  I'm even considering community service.  \ud83e\udd14 Your selfish act could have caused a serious rift between that couple.  \n\nThe court believes that you knew this to be a dick move against a fellow member, but we sense the real reason you're before us is to request leniency due to the severity of your transgression.  \n\nYou  are sentenced to a very specific apology.  Do not screw this up.  \n\nTell the aggrieved male that you F'd up.  You are not expecting his acceptance of your apology.  You realize it was a serious breach of the guy code, and you are sorry. \n\nAint gonna lie, some members of the court were demanding that you apologize to the female as well.  \n\nMan up.
