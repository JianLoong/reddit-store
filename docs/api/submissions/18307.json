The twist here is that Joe's wife, Sarah (25F), happens to be my ex-girlfriend from several years ago. We ended our relationship amicably and remained friends, but it has been a while since we last saw each other.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, I noticed Sarah sitting alone at one of the tables. Feeling nostalgic and wanting to catch up, I decided to approach her and strike up a conversation. We reminisced about old times, shared stories, and genuinely had a pleasant time reconnecting.\n\nHowever, as the night progressed, I started to notice some uncomfortable glances from Joe and a few other guests. It wasn't until later that I discovered some people had taken offense to me talking to Sarah, believing it was inappropriate and disrespectful to Joe on his wedding day.\n\nNow, I never had any romantic intentions or ulterior motives in approaching Sarah. I genuinely wanted to reconnect as friends and thought it would be a harmless conversation. However, it seems that some people interpreted it differently.\n\nWhen Joe found out about the situation, he was visibly upset and confronted me about it. He accused me of crossing boundaries and not respecting the significance of the day for him and his wife. I explained that I didn't mean any harm and that my intention was simply to catch up with Sarah as friends.\n\nSince then, things have become somewhat strained between Joe and me. Some of our mutual friends have taken sides, with some believing I was out of line for approaching Sarah, while others think it was blown out of proportion and that reconnecting with an ex as friends should be acceptable.\n\nAITA for talking to my friend's wife, who is also my ex, at their wedding? Should I have known better and avoided the situation altogether? Or was it a harmless interaction that has been blown out of proportion?\n\nMore context: I think he heard from others that I was \"flirting\" but I obviously wasn't. And yes I did try to explain that but not sure he believed me even though he has no reason to not trust me, like I said we're close friends so this is very random.", "created_utc": 1685204295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tbj5k/aita_for_talking_to_my_friends_wife_who_is_also/", "score": 379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does he expect you to duck and hide at every event y'all are at? \n\nNonsense \n\nNTA", "NTA - this is weird, if he didn\u2019t want you talking to her, why did they invite you, were you just supposed to ignore her, are you supposed to ignore her every time you guys interact?", "NTA\n\nThey invited you to the wedding. Wouldn\u2019t it have been rude for you not to speak to the bride?  I\u2019m wondering how she feels about this.  If I was her I would be incredibly pissed at my new husband for implying that he didn\u2019t trust me enough to speak to an ex that I still consider a good enough friend to have at my wedding.", "NTA This is beyond immature. Like, is this high school?\n\nIf it's inappropriate for you to have a conversation with your ex, then you should not have been invited to her wedding. As long as the conversation didn't go on forever and it wasn't flirty, I don't see how there could be any problem. Plus, if it was inappropriate, why are you at fault, but not the married lady? Reads as treating women like property to me.\n\nAlso, why is this woman sitting alone at a table at her own wedding? What weird social situation is this?", "NTA. Your friend has some major insecurities.", "NTA, why even invite you if he's worried about all that?", "Huh? If you are one of J\u2019s closest friends, how is it you didn\u2019t socialize with him and his fianc\u00e9e regularly?", "NTA. They are acting like middle schoolers and you are acting like an adult. If he is jealous or insecure that\u2019s his baggage to get over.", "NTA: if he didn't want you at the wedding, you should not have been invited. If he invited you, it would be unreasonable for you to ignore the bride, to say nothing of being rude.", "NTA if J would be offended over something as simple as speaking to S, why did he invite you to the wedding? J obviously knows about your past with S and is okay with remaining friends so I don\u2019t see why this would be the time to suddenly get defensive. And J should\u2019ve been with S anyway so she wouldn\u2019t have to have a moment alone on her wedding day. Seems like J still has some issues with your past but he can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too. Maybe you should talk with him about it to smooth it over if you still value his friendship but NTA", "NTA.  Wait you were invited to a wedding and expected not to speak to the bride?!?  This is stupid.  If Joe is so nervous about your past relationship with the bride, why invite you?  Dude, drop him and move on.  Life is too short to waste it on fake drama!", "NTA and it sounds like they\u2019re all overreacting here and being unreasonable. You were speaking with the bride on her wedding day to one of your close friends. Joe sounds insecure of your past relationships with her, but that\u2019s his own issue to deal with.

Do you only do gender specific hangouts lol.\n\nNTA but very strange that you are so disconnected from your apparently super close friend that you're never around the fianc\u00e9.

INFO How long have you been talking to the bride?", "NTA. Since you say you were not flirting, then I can only assume this is some sort of sexist BS for anyone to be upset that you would talk to the bride.  Sarah is not Joe's property now that she is his wife. It was her wedding too so why couldn't or wouldn't you talk to her as one of her guests?  \n\nI would nip this in the bud and talk to both Joe and Sarah about what happened.  I am sure Sarah will back you up.  You want to assure Joe you consider them both friends and you don't want any weirdness because a couple of gossips at the wedding were trying to start some trouble between you, or knew of your ex-status with Sarah and couldn't appreciate that you are just friends at this point in your lives.", "NTA; Sarah decides who she talks to not Joe and not obviously not you. I notice the issue started woth Joe's friends pointing it out, not Sarah. It sounds like she either didn't mind or was happy to chat with her old friend.\n\nKinda feeling like your friend Joe has some jealousy issues and unresolved insecurities about your prior relationship to Sarah that he should have figured out before getting married.\n\nBut no, there's nothing wrong with being friends with your exes and if he didn't want you talking to Sarah he should have figured that out with her and not invited you to the wedding", "NAH   You should be able to catch up, but from your comments, it sounds like it was for an extended time.  An ex having an extended 30-minute convo with the bride is sort of in bad taste.", "INFO: How long did you talk to her for? 20min? An hour? \n\nYou said 'as the night progressed' which make me wonder if y'all were talking for a very long time? Which doesn't automatically make you TA, but should be a consideration.", "He's mad at you but not her? Also it seems she didn't think you crossed any boundaries or she would have told you.", "NTA.  Why did they even invite you to the wedding if jealousy was an issue?", "NTA. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have invited you to the *wedding* if simply *talking* to the bride was enough to piss him off.", "You spoke to the bride at her wedding? Who even does that? No one talks to the BRIDE at HER WEDDING, right? /s\n\nSorry dude, your friend is super insecure. NTA", " He\u2019s jealous and suspicious of his wife and his supposed good friend *on his wedding day?!?* That says a lot about the relationship right there \ud83d\ude11 NTA,OP. Try to be a good friend next year when they\u2019re dealing with the divorce,it\u2019ll be for the best.", "NTA.\n\nI'm astounded you managed to talk to the bride alone long enough for anyone to notice or care.  The bride and groom are generally swarmed at weddings.", "Youre invited To a Wedding and people expect from you To ignore the bride? \n\nImaging at the day swore Trust To each Others Till death and at the same time beim Jealous because you talked?", "\"As the night progressed...\" How long were you talking to her for.

I don\u2019t think anyone is TA here.", "NTA. \n\nTalk to Sarah. \n\nI am willing to bet Joe overreacted at Sarah, and she got mad and now is blaming you. Could be way off base and doesn't change my vote. \n\nAs a guest, you had every right to talk to the bride or groom. If they had a problem with it you shouldn't have been invited.", "NTA - if he was so worried about your relationship why did he marry his friends \nex gf ?", "NTA you were invited to the wedding. Your close friend\u2019s wedding. And he\u2019s mad that you talked to his wife? Out in the open. In front of everyone. Sitting at a table. \n\nYour friend started dating your ex. You two remains friends. They get married. You attend. You talk to the bride \u2014 your friend\u2019s wife \u2014 your ex. I must stop. This is very weird.", "Dude, I think we both know what he was doing there.  His bestie suspected.  Half the invitees suspected.  Bad idea.", "Info: has Joe spoken to Sarah about this? The post indicates that public perception is more important to Joe than Sarah's opinion? If she was uncomfortable, I'd get it. If not, then eff his mysogyny. Either way NTA unless Sarah voiced or expressed discomfort during the wedding.", "Yeah, the OP should, on the face of it, be not TA, but that stuck out to me. It'd be weird for either the bride or groom to have a one on one conversation with a single guest for a long time.\n\nEdit: by *single*, I mean *one guest* rather than the OP's relationship status.", "Do u know what's an even worse breach of the guy code? DATING AND MARRYING YOUR FREINDS EX the actual hypocritity", "Sadly not shocking. My BFF's wife hates me because BFF and I dated for 2 years in high school. We broke up when I left for college, reconciled, and were best (platonic) friends ever since. They met when they were 24 and now we are all 29/30. Some people are just too insecure", "OP clarified that the reason she was alone was that her bridesmaids had just left her and he went immediately over. It sounds like she was alone for a matter of seconds.", "Literally every comment this guy makes is about \"guy code\"", "No they didn't. They explained that just because she  was aline, doesn't nean she was abandoned.", ">It was just about old times and we talked about J too so yeah simply a conversation.  \n>  \n>Obviously nothing of that context since it was her wedding. We just talked about how much we changed since then and stuff like that.\n\nAs stated in OP's replies in other comments, They did not reminisce about their former relationship but had a rather normal friendly conversation. I'm curious to know what you get up to at weddings. Your downvotes should giving you the hint to reflect on your thought process.", "She didn\u2019t need to mention abandoned, nobody said anything about being abandoned.  \nShe insinuated that OP bothered the bride", "This whole conversation is insane. I couldn't imagine going to a wedding where I couldn't talk to the bride.\n\nI've even helped an ex throw her wedding, these people are just insecure and controlling to a scary degree.\n\nOp is definitely NTA", "Ok, why did he invite you to the wedding if you weren't supposed to talk to her?? I feel bad for Sarah.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nMan, I feel sorry for Sarah. Hope she notices the red flags and imaturity of her husband and ask for divorce", "Nta. First & most importantly, she isnt anyone's property, she could get up & end the conversation if it was inappropriate. That said, he started dating your ex but takes issue w you talking to her? What is wrong w talking to someone?! Seems silly. If they have an issue than why invite you in the 1st place?", "It\u2019s not like you got drunk and climbed up on one of the tables and loudly professed your undying love for all to hear.\nYou chatted.  End of story.  NTA", "NTA\n\nHe knew you used to date. They invited you to the wedding. Sitting in full view of an entire room of people chatting with the bride was not crossing a line unlesx the bride was bothered by it. If the groom was bothered it seems like he could have approached at some point during this long conversation. If another guest thought it was questionable then they could have approached and talked to the bride too instead of imagining nasty things to say to the groom.\n\nThis women gets to decide who she wants to talk to though. Getting married doesn't mean she can't talk to other men ever.", "Why would your close friend want to date/marry your ex. It\u2019s a very weird situation.", "ESH. This had disaster written all over it from the get go and everyone should have known better.", "NTA.", "NTA. Why would they invite you if you weren't allowed to celebrate both of them?", "Dating someone's ex isn't an issue.  That is juvenile.  She could be perfect for you.", "I\u2019m leaning to YTA. Ok so I\u2019ll asume you don\u2019t have some sociopathic hidden intention to ignite insecurities on your friend. Think how you would feel at your wedding day and saw an ex of your wife chatting alone with her while both having a good time.\n\nEven if that ex turns out to be your friend I bet mostly would be uncomfortable at the very least, and sure insecure and what not. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the healthiest (but tbh everyone has demons) of responses but why on earth would I do something that would make my friend uncomfortable on his wedding day.\n\nAlso from what you describe not only the groom was upset at you at the wedding. Maybe the chat with your ex was (or at least seemed from afar) more flirty than you described? I mean if I wasn\u2019t the groom I wouldn\u2019t be upset about someone chatting with the bride unless a line was crossed.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t have invited you if he was that insecure about your existence. Honestly how embarrassing for him to behave so immaturely. And grown adults \u201ctaking sides\u201d? They sound like a bunch of teenagers.", "Guy code is all about respect, responsibility and morals.  In addition to not screwing anyone over.  Male or female.  This is tongue in cheek keep in mind.  \n\nInnocent talk?   Color me sceptical.  His bestie knows him better than anyone, and he aint happy.   That speaks volumes.", "Guy code from immature boys in high school? Mature people dont act by guy code, but with respect and morals! Him talking to her respectfully is not bad.", "Isn\u2019t part of the guy code not dating your bro\u2019s ex? So OP\u2019s friend marrying his ex already broke that code? Honestly it\u2019s all ridiculous. OP should be allowed to have a pleasant and polite conversation with his friend, even if it\u2019s an ex. Joe needs to calm down and trust his new wife and his friend. Joe\u2019s new wife needs to tell him to calm down. And everyone else needs to let go of the guy code nonsense.", "'As the night progressed'  .. how long and how often were they catching up? A few minutes would be silly to complain of.. but if it went on over the course of the whole event that would be an asshole move", "It's not like you drag her somewhere private to talk to her. It was pretty public and you're invited to the wedding. Isn't it anticipated that guests will talk to the bride and groom?  NTA", "Depends on how long the conversation was. A 30+ minute chat with the bride who also happens to be your ex probably looked suspicious to some of the other guests, so it's not surprising your friend got a little green-eyed. I had a close friend (ex-best friend actually) who got together with my other close friend, and proceeded to cut off all contact with me. First thing she asked him was whether he ever had feelings for me. Jealousy makes people crazy.", "That was my initial thought based on the title - but it sounds like this was an extensive conversation.  Previous relationship aside, you probably shouldn\u2019t monopolize the bride or groom at a reception, either.", "The bride should be concerned about her husband's possessiveness and jealousy (if he's acting like this on their wedding day, it's going to get ugly later on)--and the OP should consider that the groom is probably not really his friend as he apparently thinks the OP's the kind of person who would hit on the bride at her wedding. As for the other people who seemed to think the same, well, they're not worth the OP's time, so he can safely forget about them and cut them out of his life.", "YTA. \n\nLook it really isn\u2019t complicated. You don\u2019t spend a \u201cwhile\u201d catching up with your ex one-on-one at her wedding. You say congratulations, and if you chat it\u2019s not about when the two of you were a couple. You also don\u2019t chat for a while one on one. \n\nMany people are understandably uncomfortable about an ex coming to the wedding. They definitely don\u2019t want to see their bride or groom spending the night reminiscing about their time together with an ex. It\u2019s just not the place. They don\u2019t want photos of the two of you looking intimate floating around (simply leaning in towards each other chatting can look intimate in photos).  They don\u2019t want to deal with everyone else noticing either. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to be friendly with an ex - but leave off the reminiscing about how great things were with current partners awkwardly around. If you do reminisce stick to third parties -  eg Joe said your brother\u2019s left accounting to become a teacher - how\u2019s that going for him?\n\nIf this is the first you\u2019ve seen your ex in years - they have deliberately not brought you together. Maybe Joe has been worried about it - and it seems that you two getting together at their wedding for a while to talk annoy your time together means if he was worried - he\u2019d likely feel justified by that now.", "The groom really needs to check himself if he can\u2019t cope with his sloppy seconds talking to her ex that he was ok with inviting to their shot gun wedding. Go back to high school and make it make sense \ud83d\ude44", "INFO: 'reminisced about old times'\n\nDoes that include old romantic stories/times from when you were together? Because I would also consider that inappropriate.", "If it's such an issue, why were you invited in the first place..? NTA.", "Definitely did not, you are reading between lines that don\u2019t exist. All that was proposed was a theory for the bride being alone for a minute.", "NTA if Joe didn't want you to talk to his wife, he shouldn't have invited you", "NTA.  You spoke to the bride at a wedding.   If your friend is so upset about the fact you and his now wife used to date, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have started a relationship with his friends ex in the first place", "NTA.\nSounds like Joe is insecure and too immature for marriage", "You think downvotes matter? I feel sorry for you.\n\nWhen I read what you\u2019ve quoted, it\u2019s pretty clear they reminisced about their past relationship. How are you not seeing that? \u201cOld times\u201d? And what do YOU think \u201cstuff like that\u201d refers to EXACTLY?\n\nAnd sorry not sorry; he was rude. He was being an AH. He should have kept the conversation short and light, or invited her out another time. He disrespected the wedding, the bride, the groom, and the day, and regardless of downvotes that will remain true.\n\nBy the way, you don\u2019t need to keep replying in an effort to shout me down. You\u2019ve clearly expressed your opinion. Pretend it\u2019s okay with you that someone disagrees with you."]}
