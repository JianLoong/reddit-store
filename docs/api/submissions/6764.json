I wouldn\u2019t have said anything except the mom looked at me as if asking for help. The stylist looked at me too, but when I said that it kind of got really quiet the stylist tried to move on by changing the subject. There were two chairs on either side of me and the mom sat in and empty styling chair instead of next to me on the seat. It just made me wonder if I was being an AH for telling the teen to basically shut or put up and if I should have said nothing even when the mom looked at me.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The boys explain in detail to me what they want and mom says nothing. When done she gives them a big smile and tells them they look great then they go to get dinner somewhere. Other families have been like this too, where the parents allow the kids to decide (even if it\u2019s a mohawk).

It wasn\u2019t your business to begin with, but I also find it so annoying and unnecessary when parents try to dictate their childrens\u2019 appearance. As long as the hairstyle isn\u2019t vulgar or anything (can\u2019t think of one off the top of my head that would be), they should be able to express themselves however they like. Children are not dolls for their parents to dress up. \n\nEven if they are still paying for it (which is the responsibility that comes with bringing a child into the world), the parents will foster a much better relationship with their child by allowing them to feel seen and heard in how they choose to express themselves, which \u2014 therefore \u2014 will boost self confidence and build character.", "You don\u2019t know if he was at his last straw with his mom for constant questioning his choices and that\u2019s why he got irritated, it happens, kids are human too.

They can\u2019t express themselves creatively without you making it seem like they\u2019re an embarrassment.\n\n4) The answer to your question is that yes, you\u2019re still TA because you never told the 15 year old to pay for his own haircut, you were telling your *10 year old daughter loud- who never asked nor stated the color or haircut she wanted because you\u2019re the one who decided for her- enough to make sure the 15 year old heard you.\n\nYou only said that to your daughter as you were passing him and his mother to shame a teenager for wanting to express himself.\n\nTo the second question of \u201cAITA for thinking a son should pay for his own haircut if his mom doesn\u2019t like it and doesn\u2019t want to?\u201d: still the TA. \n\n1) Not every parent does \u201callowances\u201d.

You don\u2019t need an allowance\u201d.\n\n2) Some states (US) don\u2019t allow 14/15 year olds to start working until 16 and above, and if you do work, there\u2019s a lot of restrictions, one such as how much they can get paid since middle/high school students have short hours.", "YTA - I am all for stepping in and making a situation awkward if the situation calls for it, that\u2019s not the reason for my vote. The reason for my vote is simple - this child was 15 years old, most jobs (aside from agriculture) require a minimum age of 16 by law. You have no way to know if the parent pays their child for chores or provides an allowance or even allows them to do things to earn money (mow lawns, babysit etc) so it\u2019s not unlikely that the child has no money and therefore no choice in their personal appearance. Aside from that, would you feel different about the situation if you were in a department store and saw a parent trying to force their 13 y/o daughter to get a micro mini skirt that the child was clearly uncomfortable wearing? Or trying to force their male child into a dress because that is what the parent wants and it\u2019s their money? How about at a restaurant and the parent is demanding that their child order chicken instead of beef for no other reason than the parent prefers chicken? This isn\u2019t meant to be any type of political statement it\u2019s just to point out that if you have a child, you should be prepared to financially support the child and recognize that the person you are raising is an individual who has the right to express themselves. No that doesn\u2019t mean if your kid wants a $300 shirt instead of a $15 shirt you should buy it but if the kid wants the blue $15 shirt instead of the yellow $15 shirt, buy them the one they actually like. Hair grows out, it\u2019s not hurting anyone at all to allow someone in such an important stage of development when it comes to self confidence/independence to decide what they prefer for their own selves.\n\n\nAlso, just to provide a more accurate comparison, what if it was a 15 year old girl at the salon and the mom was trying to force her to bleach her hair platinum blonde and the daughter didn\u2019t want to? Would you stand up for the mom? I sure hope not\n\n\nETA - a more specific response to your question i guess would be, YTA since the kid is 15.

Because a teen 3 years from adulthood should be able to make body autonomy choices as basic as personal grooming for themselves, without the parent fearing... what exactly? A mistake? Embarrassment? Taking part in what you might deem a cringy fad? They should be allowed to take minor hits like that to get used to real-world choices they'll have in their future.
