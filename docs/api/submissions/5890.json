She is the AH here, and obviously the doctor too. \n\nYou are NTA. Ana's going to get what's coming to her, or her family's gonna lose a lot of income when Doctor loses their medical license. \n\nIn addition, who asks about the health of a baby when the baby isn't readily with the mother?

I understand why you lied and said \"maybe she was lying\"... you were just trying to protect yourself and your pregnancy since you were wrongfully outed by what you thought was a trusted doctor.
