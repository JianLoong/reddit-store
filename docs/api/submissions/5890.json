I agree with the comment that Ana was trying to spread gossip about your pregnancy. Your doctor is partly to blame for this because in certain places, it's actually *illegal* for doctors to discuss patient information.

If he or Ana says you told him you were pregnant, say you were confused because you weren\u2019t having your period and were sick and a boy kissed you on the cheek so you assumed you got pregnant or, maybe, you were waiting for an Angel to explain what was going on.
