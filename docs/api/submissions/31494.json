Just something everyone can pick at so they aren\u2019t dying of hunger by dinner time. My son (16) loves cheese, and due to this I make sure to label when he can\u2019t eat something. I labeled all the stuff for thanksgiving don\u2019t eat.\n\nWell yesterday he went and ate all of the fancy meats and basically ate from each block that I bought. I truly was pissed since I worked extra hours to pay for it since the prices are awful now for a nice cheese. \n\nI told him he needs to go to the store to replace all of it which would cost him around 70 dollars ( one of the cheese he ate was 18 dollars) or he doesn\u2019t get to eat thanksgiving meal.\n\nHe is refusing to pay for it back so no thanksgiving meal ( he will eat a sandwich) and he thinks I am being a horrible jerk. My husband is on his side and doesn\u2019t understand why I am so pissed about it\n\nEdit: thank you I made up my mind. I already informed my MIL of the situation she offered to bring a nice cheese board if he still refuses. I am giving him one last chance, he can buy it, not get thanksgiving tomorrow or work for 11 hours to make up the money ( I liked that idea form a Redditor). I have a feeling he won\u2019t do either of the options given so probably no thanksgiving and my relatives will understand.\n", "created_utc": 1700664663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181au2s/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_will_pay_back_for_the/", "score": 3355, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm so greatful!", "My dad's the cook in our family all year long! :) he makes every meal that we don't make ourselves haha, I think the last time my mom cooked was 3+ years ago and it was mostly premade stuff, the last actual meal she made was 10+ years ago and it was meatloaf while my dad was out of town xD that's her staple dish when she does cook, meat loaf. She won't be doing anything for the Thanksgiving meal, maybe Chex mix??? I plan to help out my dad in the kitchen while she shuttles family to the house from the airport. When people talk about their hubby's/dad's not knowing their way around the kitchen I'm just like... \"That's more my mom... And even she can feed herself!\" \n\nOur dad's prove just how much other men weaponize their incompetence :p", "I\u2019m happy to hear that the women are great, and that you\u2019re not saddled with every big holiday! I think it would be amazing for you to all make the guys do it- maybe then they\u2019ll understand how much work and planning and money goes into it. Then everyone could just work on it together in the future instead of half of the party pretending that a great holiday/wonderful meal are just things that magically materialize because it\u2019s Thanksgiving!", "Or just have a women's party and leave the men at home with TV dinners.", "The person you\u2019re replying to is posting from a strange (and mildly annoying) fantasy land in which everyone refuses to knowledge any aspect of reality.", "Plus just the general cleaning of bathrooms and living areas after so many people.  I agree it shouldn't be too easy, but I think 5 - 7 hours of \"community service\" isn't all that easy.", "I doubt this kid can cook and I doubt dad will make him.", "Dad should do the cooking and other chores she usually does on thanksgiving.", "Making your own cranberry sauce is 100x better. I make that.", "Yeah the only reason I got Easter last year is due to SIL getting hurt and we didn\u2019t want her cooking a ton of food with a broken arm", "Love this idea!!!! All the women go to a spa", "Yeah, they\u2019re just really good at getting my goat today.", "Iceland did a women take the day off strike in the 1970s and again recently.  Most jobs ( a few like nurses stayed for patient care) and all child care duties. \n\nThey talked about it for a year.  Schools closed, many offices closed. Fathers had a year to plan but grocery stores ran out of premade meals. \n\n\nTalk to all the women and take one of the holidays off.  Start having the guys host.  They can do all the dishes too.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t quite have a strike but let the lone uncle host a few years ago.  He did a fine turkey.", "Yeah, well, I\u2019m pretty sure my goat got got, too. It can be hard to let insufferable horseshit roll off your back, even when you know better."]}
