Just something everyone can pick at so they aren\u2019t dying of hunger by dinner time. My son (16) loves cheese, and due to this I make sure to label when he can\u2019t eat something. I labeled all the stuff for thanksgiving don\u2019t eat.\n\nWell yesterday he went and ate all of the fancy meats and basically ate from each block that I bought. I truly was pissed since I worked extra hours to pay for it since the prices are awful now for a nice cheese. \n\nI told him he needs to go to the store to replace all of it which would cost him around 70 dollars ( one of the cheese he ate was 18 dollars) or he doesn\u2019t get to eat thanksgiving meal.\n\nHe is refusing to pay for it back so no thanksgiving meal ( he will eat a sandwich) and he thinks I am being a horrible jerk. My husband is on his side and doesn\u2019t understand why I am so pissed about it\n\nEdit: thank you I made up my mind. I already informed my MIL of the situation she offered to bring a nice cheese board if he still refuses. I am giving him one last chance, he can buy it, not get thanksgiving tomorrow or work for 11 hours to make up the money ( I liked that idea form a Redditor). I have a feeling he won\u2019t do either of the options given so probably no thanksgiving and my relatives will understand.\n", "created_utc": 1700664663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181au2s/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_will_pay_back_for_the/", "score": 9001, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glorious, sweet Jeju tangerines. We were sick from eating them too fast. Occasionally, we got treats like fruit gushers or fruit rollups from base kids, but those were kind of (really) gross. My dad could never keep hot tamales in the house because they would 'magically' vanish every time. They still do. \n\nWe also had a jar of coins by the door, and we kids could purloin it and run down to the corner store and sort through the stuff there and say buy a tray of kimbap or something and share it. A big bucket of strawberries was something like $1.50 roughly.  We once bought a thing of mandu together and ate that, because it wasn't enough to ruin dinner, and it was $3 for us 4 kids to split between us. It literally makes everything inside of me scream when I look at the prices of Shin Ramen because I remember buying that when it was 50 cents. But we usually picked something way cheaper, since the coins were left over from our bus fare for the week. We got to keep what we didn't use if we woke up early enough and walked. The jar started to go bare when they made the switch to the reloadable electronic passes. I think I was in high school? \n\nBut yeah.

The funny thing was, we ALL had keys to get in through the outside door. My parents knew this. We just automatically obeyed the kitchen door lock. \n\nOne time we came in through the kitchen door because the front door was blocked off because of a bunch of boxes (our first indication we were  having Important Guests) and we trotted up to the kitchen, unlocked the door and opened, it, and when we started to get inside, we realized that we needed to NOT be in there, backed out, and went up the fire escape and hopped balconies when we realized no one had the key to the fire escape door, but the hidden key to the emergency roof door was likely still in its spot.

The mother is trying to use discipline to teach her son a lesson.\n\nNTA and stick to your guns about this.", "OP's kid is going to make a minifridge seller happy, indeed. As a start.", ">Like who the fuck raised such an inconsiderate asshole?\n\nOP's husband.", "See poisoned roommate post for a glimpse of future son if he doesn\u2019t learn to leave food alone!", "Parents that want to be their kid's friend are doing their kid no favors.   \n\n\nAnd I say that as someone whose dad wanted me to be his friend. All it did was make shit confusing, because one minute he's my friend and then the next, he's demanding I kowtow to his authority.", "Hey now buddy, you listen here. But in all seriousness I call my son buddy all the time but I have pretty much his whole life so it seems he knows depending on my tone whether it's friendly buddy or serious buddy....", "Lol I rarely call my children by their names (even tho I chose, and love, all 3), my youngest thought her name was Princess till she was 4!!  They are all Honey, Darling, Precious, Sweetheart, etc, but they still know I\u2019m their mum.  Sorry, I just think that a particular ridiculous way of judging someone as a parent", "My family has a tradition since 1980 that the mean do all of the cleaning up at big events. They are allowed to pay teenagers to fo it for then units a pretty hefty amount. I remember getting paid $50 in 1990 to take my step dads place.", "This. If family members don't appreciate it or contribute -- and actively sabotage it -- the hell with it. Let the women make a nice dinner and let the guys fend for themselves.", "Good for you. When I was a kid, we used to  go to Grandma and Grandpa's house for TG. How fun. The guys watched football. The women stood in the kitchen all afternoon cleaning up. I do miss my grandparents but I didn't enjoy the holiday.", "My dad's side was always pizza or Chinese or something. We used to have Christmas dinner on Grey Cup weekend at the end of November because everyone was too busy over Christmas and we could do casual game-day food instead of fancy. \n\nNow my sister and I do super casual holidays all the time. Had pizza for thanksgiving this year. Had cold cuts and buns last year.\n\nIt was a game changer and I dread the full sit-down spread at my in-laws because it puts my MIL through the ringer.", "I love this!!!!!", "\"Just relax!  It will all be fine.  You're overreacting.  Everything will work out.  It always does.\"  Says the man who seems to have no freaking idea on why or how it always manages to work out for him.", "Right?!", "Exactly!", "Theft of cheese and meat is an universal recognized declaration of war. Son should have known what he was getting into beforehand. Now it's time he learns thru pain, suffering, and the lack of turkey dinner", "Dude this idea is so so good. Gonna try to get my MIL to do this one year. (In a nice way lol.)", "The part of Ireland that my Mother comes from has a tradition of Womens Christmas on Jan 6th. \n\nThat day the women used to meet up in houses, drink tea and eat cake and the men would be in charge of houses, children, food for the day and put away decorations.\n\nNowadays the women tend to go out for the day or have a meal or night out together.", "Great Geandma is ahoot or at least was! Love her for that! \n\nSometimes we women are our biggest enemy within. \n\nI applaude you for sticking to your guns! Hope you did go into the \u201eSmoking Lounge\u201c!", "Dad should also work the overtime needed to pay for the additional food before you even get to the physical and mental labour of the day.", "Exactly. The fact that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal shows that he doesn\u2019t lift a finger to help in any way and doesn\u2019t grasp the time and work hosting a family holiday entails.", "Then everybody most likely gets a shitty thanksgiving", "Maybe they should cook dad and slice him up for thanksgiving charcuterie board", "Glad his parents took him back. The very last roommates I had before getting my own apartment was a childhood friend and her older brother. I had known her since we were in 4th grade, and him by association. She was great and we're still friends, but her brother would jist eat or take whatever he wanted. Ended taking and losing my expensive fancy silverware to his job sites. Like fancy spiraled metal, when we had plastic cutlery he could have taken. Another instance I went and got subway, came home and set the full meal on the table while  used the restroom. I come back from peeing not even 2 minutes later and my chips were gone. He managed to eat my food that quick! I was passed at him. Dude was dumber than a box of bricks. Love her, but living with him was the last push to ditch roommates and get my own place.", "That's what I mean, if one parent is undermining or enabling, the kid is never gunna get it. Dad and son are TA!", "It's like looking into the future. Dumpster eggs!", "Yep! Non-cooking adults do the clean up, preteens set the table", "And then being chased away from the fridge by mom xD", "It's not collective. Son is being punished for stealing food, husband is being punished for being a spineless weenie.", "Growing up, my mom would spend hours making all this amazing food including the cranberry sauce and my dad would insist on still eating that canned crap. \n\nLest you think he\u2019s a huge asshole, he cooked all other meals during the year (my mother weirdly could cook these extravagant holiday meals but could not cook a small meal for four to save her life) and was raised on the canned crap so it\u2019s nostalgic for him. \n\nMy mother never got angry with him for eating that, but we always laughed at how idiotic it was.", "Recipe?", "The fact that her husband didn\u2019t step in and instead put a holiday you don\u2019t even like on your shoulders is ridiculous. Also, on what planet is it your job to both WORK EXTRA HOURS to afford parts of the meal and also be solely responsible for organizing and cooking it. If your husband wants a traditional housewife experience, he needs to make a traditional husband salary?", "Alas, I did not. They were smoking those cheap, fake cigars and they stunk.", "Dad should go out and hunt and slaughter a new turkey by himself next year.", "Some skilled epoxy handling and you could make a nice board out of his vertebrae.\n\nA wind chime out of his ribs for grandma.\n\nRitual bone knife from the sternum for mom.\n\nReally, upcycling a shitty dad could be a good family bonding activity for everyone.", "Smoked and sliced would be the way to go.", "This is the best idea yet!!!", "His parents loved him. He was adopted and they really, REALLY overcompensated because they had a complex that he'd think they loved him less because he wasn't biologically theirs. They only realized after the fact what they'd done.  \n\n\nBoth had grown up poor, both children of holocaust survivors, and while they spoiled him and his older sister like crazy, it came from a good place. Not \"you can do no wrong\" but \"we want you to have everything we could not\".", "Yup! My mom knew my MO well by then, I would've gotten it if I ate all that meat and cheese", "Gosh, I think it's America's Test Kitchen. Cranberry, orange zest and juice, sugar. I usually add more sugar to taste. Some recipes also use alcohol, if that's your preference. I mash the berries more too. It's fun to pop them.", "A simple recipe is one cup of water and 1 cup of sugar. Bring it to a boil and add 12 oz of fresh cranberries. Bring that to a boil and then turn it down and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Voila! Cranberry sauce :-) I do mash the berries a bit as they cook. You can throw in tangerine peel, an entire chopped tangerine, but our favorite is jalapenos :-) jalapeno cranberry sauce is the bomb and now everybody asks us to bring it every year. I just started jarring it up so we could share."]}
