I do not fault them for this, but share it to paint the portrait.  \n\nMy husband is not nearly as satisfied with his work or community here.

His mother is correct in that you should focus on your future.  Your husband is acting as if she will be gone tomorrow but according to the professionals, it could be another decade.  I don't think MIL is just saying that.  I doubt she will want your husband hovering over her until she passes cuz that could be quite a bit.", ">I\u2019m being unreasonable and **prioritizing my job** over spending time with **his mom** during her final years.\n\nHe's in a rough spot. He's being completely unreasonable AND refusing to listen those around him including therapists and the very person knocking on death's door.\n\nI've got a lot of friends in healthcare. One thing is certain: Facing one's own mortality brings a lot of clarity.\n\n> My MIL has discouraged us from moving and has urged us to stay focused on building our own futures. My husband thinks she is just saying that and would be very happy if we moved.\n\nLife is for the living. Death is an unfortunate part of that. Your husband wants to tear the whole family apart because he can't manage his grief. That's truly sad.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you took multiple steps in his direction and it\u2019s you\u2019re whole life on the line which he doesn\u2019t recognize. \nYou\u2019re open to finding a compromise while he persists on his opinion of what you should do. Would your MIL consider to move closer to you after retirement?", "**NTA** \\- It's a complex and difficult situation you're facing. It's understandable that your husband wants to be closer to his mom during this challenging time, but it's also important to consider the practical implications and your own career and personal commitments. You've proposed compromises and explored alternative options to balance both priorities, which shows your willingness to find a solution that works for everyone.\r  \n\r  \nTaking into account the progress you've made in your career, the lack of a support network in the new city, and the impact on your family's stability, it's reasonable for you to have concerns about uprooting your lives. It's also significant that your MIL has encouraged you to focus on building your own futures.\r  \n\r  \nCommunication and understanding are crucial here. Try to have an open and heartfelt conversation with your husband, expressing your concerns and listening to his perspective as well. It's essential to find a solution that considers the well-being of all family members involved. Ultimately, it's a decision that needs to be made collectively, taking into account various factors.", "NTA - You've already moved once to be closer to his family, now he wants to uproot you again. I think this could have more to do with his dissatisfaction with his work life and resentment at your fulfillment in your work, than wanting to spend time with his mom in her final (hopefully) decade.", "NTA. while it is unfortunate that she has cancer (cancer fuckin SUCKS to put it mildly), that doesn't mean you don't still need money or have living expenses. your husband isn't thinking rationally cause he's overcome with guilt, which i understand.", "I give your MIL credit for encouraging you to look to your futures rather than tear your lives up for her sake. Your husband is saying she doesn't mean it: do you believe she's sincere? She might be, and this decision you'd be making to uproot turns on the fact of her illness. If she's stable, she may live years yet, and I hope she does and gets to enjoy some of her retirement. \n\nIf you do believe your MIL is sincere in telling you not to move, it's possible that your husband, who's expressed dissatisfaction with his present life situation unrelated to his mother's illness, is using her illness as an excuse to disrupt your lives and start over in a different city, which new start might turn out well, or really not. I'm sure he's genuinely concerned about her, but I wonder why he's adamant you must move closer, now, when if I understand correctly your MIL is not immediately terminal.\n\nYou've offered compromises, and he's completely unreceptive. It's not an easy situation, but you're definitely NTA here.", "NTA...your first concern has to be your own wellbeing and that of your child. Once the shock has worn off, hopefully your husband can revisit some of the other options you listed. In the meantime,  feel no guilt.", "NTA\n\nYou've offered plenty of compromise on this situation and it sounds like he's rejecting all of it. Try not to be too hard on him, all I've ever had is my Mother and I'd be losing my mind over this as well.", "Nta. It's fine to want to move closer to family. It's fine to want to stay where your career and circle of friends is located. Neither OP not her husband are wrong for what they are feeling or what they want.\n\nWhere OP's husband becomes TA is in refusing any kind of compromise when OP is trying to find something that works for both.  OP is being asked to give up career and friends - with no guarantee that her hubby will be any happier.", "NTA.\n\nYou've offered numerous compromises and he isn't willing to entertain the idea of any of them. That speaks volumes about his current state of mind. It might be time for a bit of tough love in that you should refuse to make any decisions until he can prove he isn't spiraling. If he was already in therapy, this should be a no-brainer. At the very least, his therapist should be able to help him understand he can't just make this decision for everyone without at the very least a full conversation. That includes compromises.\n\nI'm really sorry you are all having to go through this. From all angles it's really an unfortunate situation. Not that it should be required, but perhaps show him some good faith by looking for job opportunities closer to his parents and see if any of them stand out. You never know what could be waiting. Of course, you should also be clear that this is not an agreement to move, you're simply showing that compromise is possible and you're willing to entertain the idea. Something he's clearly unwilling to do at this point.\n\nGood luck!", "Is there support groups that he can join? Like families dealing with cancer, children of cancer patients,  etc. I know he is in therapy but maybe he needs to talk to people going through the same thing. NTA", "NTA. Your husband's judgement is clouded with emotion. He's right to want to spend time with her but he needs to realize that he is sacrificing his own life for that and that he will be left picking up the pieces of his marriage/divorce afterwards.", "NAH. your husband is dealing with shock of expected death of his mother and at this stage is not very rational.  It is completely understandable.  You have proposed many reasonable alternatives and are being supportive. You may want to recruit his mother as an ally given that she has the same view as you.  One avenue of discussion is that his mom may have 10 years to live. He should not bury her yet. The best gift he can give her is to see his family thrive.", "NAH. I feel like you and your husband both have valid points of view. However, I feel like I\u2019d side with your take on the situation, and here\u2019s why.\n\nIt\u2019s the normal way of things for children to outlive their parents. For you to uproot everything you have for what is a relatively short-term goal (2-10 years) will leave you, at the end of it, unfulfilled professionally and in a city that neither of you would probably have chosen to live in, we\u2019re it not for his mother\u2019s illness.\n\nI don\u2019t AT ALL want to minimize your husband\u2019s struggle with this. After all, it\u2019s his mother. However, moving, especially when it effects your career so profoundly, would be a short-sighted mistake. \n\nI say all of this because I\u2019ve been through it. Both my and my wife\u2019s mother had concurrent cancer diagnoses. We packed up our family to move closer to care for them, and they both passed within 2 months of each other. That left us in a city that we hated without our mothers. \n\nI think your leave of absence idea is a good one. Also going to their city on weekends and possibly vacations is good, too. I just feel like moving wholesale would end up being a mistake.\n\nI feel for you both. This is tough, and I hope things work out for the best.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "I have the feeling your husband feels dissatisfied with his life in general - and is unconsciously using the family tragedy as an excuse to make yet another ultimately dissatisfying - move. He has to figure his own \\[stuff\\] and not drag his family along.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He's dealing with shock. Poorly. But I can't entirely fault him for that. What I can fault him for is trying to uproot his family. He intends to move closer to her and spend more time when you'll seemingly be the only thing holding everyone together for a while. It's entirely unfair to you and your child, and everything you've both worked towards. He needs to continue with therapy, he's not even listening to the person that's facing their own mortality", "NTA.", "NAH - His emotional distress and prioritizing his mom/parents is coloring his decisions. You view this from a different perspective and you are not emotionally attached to them and hold tightly to no lose your professional options. **Have you both asked his mom/parents how they want to be supported? This is a huge piece. If you both continue to assume this it can lead to feeling hurt, resentful, and not appreciated.**\n\nGoal: Secure MIL/FIL's input. Create a plan you both can support. Perhaps one that has various stages. Since he is going to therapy inquire if the counselor can host you both in session to explore your options. They can guide the discussion, navigate emotions and keep you on track to reach short and long term goals. You wrote as if everyone must make big changes and lose out in order to gain. This not the only path. Both of you need to feel valued and supported at this time. Best to you.", "NAH. Grief starts long before the person has actually passed in cases like this.   \nHe's staring down the face of losing her and doesn't know what to do. The anxiety he's experiencing and his logic is understandable. If this is a recent diagnosis, he's probably still reeling, and it's not the time to be making big life decisions like moving anyways.   \nTherapy can help, but it's not going to completely irradicate the grieving. His mindset is just part of the process. He may be feeling guilty for not being there and thinks that if he gives up his life and moves there, it'll alleviate some of the grief.   \nMy brother was halfway across the country with my parents when we found out he was terminal. I really struggled with how badly I wanted to just be with him every waking second until the end. I took a few trips out, and spent a few weeks of time with him whenever I could without giving up my life here. We messaged and talked and I sent him care packages often. I also thought about moving out there thinking it would be the best thing. It might have been helpful in some regards, but I think the fact that I didn't let go of my day to day life is actually what helped me when he did pass. It made it easier to go on with life, because I had a life to go back to after he passed.   \nI took a lot of comfort in the sense of normalcy that my every day life gave me.   \nI loved going to work because that was the only place that my life seemed normal, like nothing had changed. I was thankful that I had my friends that I've always known, and we went back to doing the things we normally did together. It kept me grounded and kept me sane.   \nYou may want to suggest this to him, that while moving there and being close to her now seems like a good idea, when she's gone, it'll feel like an even bigger hole. Everything will be a reminder of how she's not there anymore. He's going to outlive her, and he needs to maintain a life that is separate from her, something that still feels normal, after she is gone. It will help him heal, and that's probably something his mother wants for him too. She wants him to be happy still after she is gone.   \nI don't know what the balance is for you two when it comes to how often he can be gone, but you might want to remind him how grounding having his home base will be while he goes through this, but that he can visit her as often as he wants for as long as he wants within reason. Remind him that more changes are going to affect his mental health more adversely, and advise that you guys wait a little bit before completely uprooting your lives. For me, the balance was going back every couple of months for a few weeks at a time, and at the end of his illness, I was there for almost a month straight before he passed. I even stayed there with my parents for awhile after he passed to grieve together, do the funeral, and take some time off work to heal.   \nJust try to be gentle and supportive, and come at it as if you are looking out for his best interest in the long run. Let him visit as often as he can, and go with him when you feel inclined. Chances are, he just needs time to process this recent diagnosis for her and he will start thinking a little more logically. It sounds like he's just going through the stages of grief and that guilt and bargaining are playing a big part right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm similarly dealing with my Father being given 6-18 months to live with basically terminal lung cancer when I live a five hour flight away.

Cancer sucks, but uprooting your family, quitting your job, and moving to be near her isn't a reasonable response, and at only a short flight away, it's not exactly an unreasonable hardship to visit regularly.  2-10 years is also a pretty wide range, people beat those estimates often, and there's frequent advances in medicine that could improve things even more.  She doesn't even want him to do this. Encourage him to try out a new therapist if the current one isn't helping him to cope. He may also benefit from trying medication to help with the depression, if that's not something he's already doing. She'll also be retiring soon, and have plenty of flexibility to travel to you at that point, as often as she wants.
