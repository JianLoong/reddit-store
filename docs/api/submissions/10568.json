We have had numerous discussions about our future and we both see our relationship going the distance.\n\nWe had a similar trajectory both primarily studying in the first 5 years of our relationship and working part time. University was not an option in my hometown so I moved to study and supported myself through a part time job and living in a share house, my partner lived with her parents. \n\nNow we both work full time and live together (renting) I currently earn \\~18% more money than her. We split all financial responsibilities 50/50. I have previously offered to divide our expenses based on our earnings. However, she previously declined. In recent years we have discussed purchasing a house together as we are both tired of spending money on rent and would rather put it to our own place.\n\nMy girlfriend is unsatisfied with her career path and has now decided to specialize and go back to university which I am fully supportive of. She is cutting her work hours by 60% to free up time for study. I still would like to purchase a property to live in. My plan was to offer her significantly reduced rent compared to what's available on the market and I thought that would be my way of supporting her and the money would go to a permanent property we will likely share for the rest of our lives.\n\nTo my surprise she was not enthusiastic of this idea saying it will be hard to afford any rent while studying. She then suggested once she cuts her hours for university, we start splitting expenses based on salary. When I initially offered to divide expenses on salary, we were both working full time, she has now intentionally cut her hours. I asked what if she completely quit her job would I then be expected to 100% financially support her? My answer is I love her, and I will support her if it comes to it, but I don\u2019t think it is fair. I went through university supporting myself, I wouldn\u2019t wish it on someone else, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to just completely dump the responsibility on your partner.\n\nWhether I purchase a property or not it seems she would like a break from rent and never discussed this with me.\n\nTrying to understand her side, my country has income support for students if they meet a certain criterion. I believe the scenario where I purchase a property and charge her rent will make her less likely to be eligible for the income support. Being accepted into this income support is not guaranteed, I was denied throughout my studies. If she is accepted, she likely could afford rent.\n\nShe started this whole process without consulting me and she likely will not be eligible for the government handout even if we continue renting. She is yet to even apply for the income support and to be honest I\u2019m a little surprised she is putting this all on me without discussion.", "created_utc": 1676989772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1184q8h/aita_if_i_dont_want_to_financially_support_my/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My salary covered the mortgage comfortably and he chipped in for utilities, food shop etc. He now earns more than me (boo) so contributes more. But we are committed; so I think a lot depends on if you honestly see this relationship as forever or not.", "NTA. You are not married and she did not discuss her plans to make you the sole earner of the household with you. That's highly unfair and presumptuous on her part. You also point out that you worked while in college and feel she can do the same. That is very fair, IMO. I also worked in college to support myself. Many people do. I would sit down and discuss this with her; good communication goes a long way.", "NTA. Financial decisions that affect both of you should be discussed and agreed upon by both of you.

Don't get used as her education fund.\n\nIf you were married and had financial ties, then sure, but you aren't. There is no requirement for her to pay you back after she graduates, she could dump you and walk away.\n\nSince you aren't married, you should both be contributing as close to equal to your household expenses as possible.\n\nThat is the logical argument. The emotional one is to help support her. but you need to be clear on the requirements and she clearly has been going ahead without even communication. She needs to do better if she wants your support.", "NTA - but I think that is secondary to the main problem here. \n\nYou are both young and seem smart but this is a big communication issue, and that can cause problems. Not necessarily because of this exact issue but of future miscommunications. The best thing you can do is sit down with each other and honestly talk about your different expectations and why. Make sure you both are heard and feel understood. Set a good foundation of how to approach these kind of decisions and communication. I don\u2019t think either one of you is trying to take advantage of each other, but being able to communicate will make your lives so much better as your problems and stressors grow. \n\nWish you both luck.", "INFO - are you unhappy with the idea of her having a better quality of life than you did when you were studying? Or are you hesitant because this is investing in \"her\" future?\n\nIf you can buy a house with a mortgage in your name (she pays rent) until she has finished studying and can contribute more equitably. Then you looking at co-owning property together. That way if you break up you come away with your house and she has her education. If you don't break up, you have invested in your future together.", "NTA honestly that's a lot to take on and really rude of her to have those expectations and not at least allow for discussion.", "NAH\n\nPerhaps she feels since she has been paying in more than you by percentage of earnings that the \"pot\" of pooled resources can now give back to her a bit? Perhaps she declined your suggestion of paying 18% more than her because she felt she was investing into something and building an excess there?\n\nBut it's something that definitely should be discussed between you first, not just assumed.\n\nWill her career trajectory following return to school improve significantly? Is this an investment in YOUR future too, if she is able to earn more? Does SHE see it that way, that it's for both of you? Are you worried she will get the new qualification and then leave so you have taken a financial hit for no gain? Do you feel she otherwise is a person who has taken financial advantage of you? Could you in fact afford to support her while she does this? Would it be a struggle? \n\nYou guys aren't married and have no financial responsibilities towards each other. But it sounds like you imagine a more roommates financial arrangement just now and she imagines a more married one. It's ok, you just need to talk about it and decide how to proceed together.", "Soft YTA. Seven years is a long time. You say you see this relationship going the distance. If she gets a degree hen her earning capacity presumably goes up ultimately benefiting you. \nFinancially supporting a partner is no small thing, but couples do it all the time. What would happen if your partner took time off for a baby? Would you make her continue to pay rent?\nMaybe the problem is that you aren\u2019t as confident in the relationship as you say? A ring seems overdue. Is there a reason you haven\u2019t proposed yet?", "ESH.\n\nShe apparently did not discuss this with you before committing to doing this.  If this is what you were upset about, I\u2019d be 100% on your side and say that you weren\u2019t the asshole.\n\nHowever, you mostly seem upset about the idea of supporting your girlfriend of seven years as she goes back to school, *not* the fact she didn\u2019t discuss it with you beforehand.  Your attitude seems to be that even if she talked to you about it, you still would have said no, because you don\u2019t want to financially support her (although you could.)\n\nYou\u2019ve been together seven years, dude.  The idea of sacrificing now in order to be better off later is a pretty common one in a committed relationship.  It sounds like you\u2019re not committed to this relationship long-term, because you\u2019re seeing all the short-term sacrifices and not the long-term benefits of her getting more schooling and a better paying job.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you *should* want to support her now to make your family better off later.  What I am saying is that not wanting to do so, when you can, is a pretty clear indicator that you\u2019re not committed to a future with her.  And if you\u2019re not committed to a future together, after *seven years*?  That\u2019s a pretty clear indicator you should move on.\n\nSo, yeah, your girlfriend did a shitty thing by not discussing this with you.  However, in a larger sense, if you\u2019re not committed to joining your future together after seven years, please break up.", "YTA.

She switched majors at least 4-5 times, took much longer to graduate as a result, and once she landed the job, decided she did not want to take her turn and support him going back to school after all. She ended up cheating on him not long after, and they got divorced.

Or has she not specifically outlined what it would mean financially?\n\nI'm only asking because I will very often tell my husband stuff like \"all the kids are off on Thursday so I'll need to figure out something to do with them\" and when Thursday comes he's surprised I need the car to take them out because I didn't actually clarify that I meant I'd be taking them out in the car.\n\nIs it possible she thinks she HAS talked to you about it but that in the moment of that discussion you didn't realise the gravity it had, or maybe weren't fully following what she said?
