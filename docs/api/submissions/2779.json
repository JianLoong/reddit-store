He may be a deadbeat dad, but that doesn\u2019t justify you creating more drama in what is already a difficult situation. Do you want what\u2019s best for your godson and sister, and to support them through this, or do you want to get your petty jabs in at your nephew? Because you can\u2019t have both.", "NTA", "NTA: These are the consequences for actions.", "I suspect ESH. He's obviously failed as a parent, so yeah, asshole. But that wording is very, very inflammatory. He's fucked up, most def, but it's never going to strengthen anybody's position to hypothesize about who loves or does not love someone 'the most'. People are wonderful, shitty, complicated. And while we have to go off of people's behavior, feelings and behavior aren't always in sync. \n\nIt's possible you didn't see the post that way in the moment, weren't even thinking about it, but I suspect not. I feel like what needs to happen here is that everybody needs to evaluate who they want in their lives, online or in person, and go from there. If you guys are resentful towards your nephew then I don't see how it's helpful for you, or the nephew, or L to have that negativity floating around. I mean just think, L is growing up in a time when all their lives are documented online from start to finish, and what if they one day dig back and look at that post that heavily implies that you guys don't think his parents loved him enough. Maybe before he's really old enough to work through the complicated feelings that come with having parents who drop the ball this badly (speaking from personal experience). It helped me to not have these sort of comments and accusations thrown around, to be able to work through a lot of the grey areas when I was old enough to start viewing adults as Actual People and to question why my childhood went how it did. Might be best to go low contact, and hopefully one day nephew will get his shit together and want to make things right. Or bite the bullet and have a brutally honest convo with him now, if it hasn't already happened.", "People still have Facebook drama? I thought Facebook was passe.", "YTA Your nephew and his partner realized that they would be shitty parents so they gave up custody of their own child. That is probably the most responsible thing they have done in their life. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an easy choice. Or if it was easy then that\u2019s proof that it was the best choice.  It sounds like this decision put the kid in the best situation possible. I\u2019m not sure why you hate your nephew. Or why you think you know his living circumstances well enough to judge the practicalities of traveling to another state. The facts are that the kid is doing well and the birth parents aren\u2019t trying to interfere. You admit your post was petty. You purposely worded it to give you plausible deniability.  Well congratulations Perry Mason mission accomplished. You found a loophole and exploited it. It only cost you the respect of your family. Now they all think you should apologize for being an asshole. Good luck on getting invited to next years birthday party.", "This child was signed over to her actual parents. Why not let them grow up with the people that love them and leave those other idiots alone. They know when their sons birthday is. You don\u2019t have to remind them. \n\nY\u2019all all buttholes. Focus on the kid, leave the birth parents alone to do their thing. They won\u2019t get custody back regardless. The kids parents should talk to a lawyer to make sure that can\u2019t happen.", "YTA.  Your entire post suggests that you did, in fact, mean to provoke him in some way. Sure, he's the world's worst dad, but this was a very childish way to point that out to him and everyone.", "YTA. They signed away all rights they had of L to your sister, they have 0 obligation to make show up to the birthday party. Sometimes signing away your rights is showing more love than you think. Love is shown in more ways than being able to show up on a 1st birthday. Sometimes it's shown, by not being shown at all.  \n\nIt would also probably be quite painful for them to be at the party, when they know they aren't legally L's parents. You should have a sit down with them and discuss what their plans are. Maybe they aren't able to be L's parents but don't know how to express that. I know I would struggle with that. Maybe they need support to be able to get to a point they can be good, supportive parents. If they are in a volitile relationship, that isn't healthy for a baby. Be there to support them and to ensure L grows up in a healthy dynamic.", "YTA. Pettiness makes you look bad,  not him.  I don't understand how you feel entitled to judge their finances,  schedules, and reasonings to not go as being legitimate or not.  Causing family drama is immature. Apologize and keep your judgements to yourself.", "ESH\n\nYou knew what your wording would do and now you are trying to make yourself look innocent because it blew up exactly as should have been expected.\n\nYour nephew's biofather is only fooling himself. He gave up his child - which actually is probably a good act since they don't sound ready to parent -and short notice cancelled on seeing him - which is AH behaviour especially if it continues into an age where you nephew actually knows what is going on.\n\nYou both need to grow up and realise there's a small child here who doesn't need the drama in his life.", "I'm conflicted. \n\nYTA based on how your post is written and that you identify it as \"petty\" in the title you obviously wrote it to take a shot at him. \n\nOn the other hand... I don't think many people will condemn you for sticking it to the absentee father social media Narcisst (I live my best life and its better than yours Facebook person) for being fake... so I wanna say NTA", "YTA, that phrasing is definitely designed to suggest that those that weren't there don't love L.\n\nYou want to help, change the phrasing and apologise to your nephew. You don't want to truly alienate him. Even though it's tough right now, it's better if L can still have a good relationship at some point with his birth parents, AND those that are caring for/watching out for L now.", "NTA - But who did your post hurt most - your nephew or your sister?", "First off, Qs: is the little one being raised to think of your sister as mum? Was there a financial agreement between the parties? Are nephew and birth mother doing well enough that coming back would not have been a financial issue (flights are possibly not the only expense), or are they living on your sister's dime? \n\nIn the meantime, Devil's advocate here. Is it possible that signing over custody of the little one was the most mature/responsible/loving thing either nephew or birth mother have ever done? It sounds like in doing so they've allowed L to escape what was possibly going to be poor circumstances, regardless of their reasoning.\n\nIf per chance that is the case, is it not also possible that they moved out of state and haven't visited/video called both as a way to deal with that and to not confuse little one?\n\nSometimes when these choices are made, it actually is with the good of the baby in mind, and doesn't mean the birth parents don't love baby very much. \n\nAnd sometimes, this happens because of AHs having babies they don't care about. \n\nIt's truly impossible to know which this is from here, and very difficult to be sure even up close. \n\nAll that only for say that the FB post might have indeed been hurtful. \n\nUnfortunately for nephew, if that's the case he should be blocking family members whose posts are too difficult to see, as the people actually raising the child are allowed to be happy and excited. \n\nYour post did sound a bit like it was intentionally meant to be a dig, but if not, NTA regardless. \n\nIf it was meant to be a dig, minor Y T A because it's unfair to be cruel when people have made a responsible choice like this one, even if you aren't sure the reasons are noble, imo.\n\n(Assuming there isn't an agreement somewhere saying they'll still be in L's life or other precise circumstances).", "ESH\n\nYou knew exactly what you were doing. \"He's a serial facebooker\".... \"They made their respective posts\"..... then you write \"With those who love him most\".... Just admit it. You and your niece were calling him out without actually calling him out. \n\nHe needs to step up and be a father and the mother does too.", "This is a much healthier approach for L, too, who in this day and age will grow up able to see all these things online. Much better to highlight all the positivity and love for L in these public forums, and not highlight the shortcomings of adults around him REGARDING him. Kids tend to internalize that shit.", "Not until the CEO is seasoned, cooked, and eaten. Then facebook will be over.", "Also, 21 yo using FB?", ">he's the world's worst dad\n\nLol\nI wish my dad would of signed his rights away and just stepped out of mine and my brothers' life. Would of made life a lot easier for a lot of people.", "Btw, did it not occur to you that maybe they didn't want to go to a party where they would stand in awkwardness and fear of being judged by everyone else in the room?", "So....esh?", "I wouldn\u2019t apologize to the nephew. The sister, but not him.", "The custody arrangement has not  been made permanent, it is basically him under my sister\u2019s care until SHE agrees to sign him back over, no set date.\n\nMy mom has attempted to speak to him on multiple occasions. According to him his plans are he supposedly wants to establish himself and get the baby back, but his actions don\u2019t speak to that at all. While raising a baby was not in my sister\u2019s plans at this point, that was a big fat \u201chell no\u201d from her part, at least for now based on what has been seen from his part.\n\nLegally, no financial arrangements were made. However he did agree to send her money for his care. Instead my sister has been sending him money to help with rent, food, etc as he often claims he doesn\u2019t even have money for food but posts pics/vids smoking weed and drinking booze. \n\nIf they were to have come to the party, they would have stayed with family as there is space. The DAY OF the party he was messaging my sister non-stop asking for her to get him a plane ticket for the following day. \n\nUltimately I think he lies, manipulates and takes advantage of my sister and my mom, and they keep enabling him. My sister paid his rent and food costs for months while he lived in her same state, even after she already had custody of his kid, because he couldn\u2019t hold down a job. The worst is that they are apparently expecting another child. \n\nI can\u2019t disagree that L is in a better situation, but it sucks for her too to have to raise a whole baby at 42 after all her kids are grown.", "ESH but OP is the right kind of AH", "Yup.

Your sister sounds like she\u2019s an enabler.", "Truth hurts, but in the future maybe think about the effect its actually going to have (making petty posts) like this, on your sister, since it appears that most of the backlash was directed at her as he then blew up her phone rather than confronting you. \n\nIn reality, your probably right. But is it better to be right, or better to be kind? I guess NTA/ESH but it would be nicer if you apologised to your sister for the drama caused.", "NTA The only reason he's angry is because you made him look and feel bad.

Thanks for clarifying these things!\n\nIn this case he should make every effort, of course! \n\nI'm sorry this occurred and has put so much strain on your sister. Because of course it has, even if this was a \"better\" situation. \n\nI can't say I'd be above a slight jab here either (IF it was intentional) since he's supposed to be making an effort, is not, and can't even make his mind up whether or not to visit. \n\nGoodness, I do hope they're not expecting again, and I hope however it happens, your sister gets some peace from this saga.", "Then don't make her life worse by making passive aggressive little digs on facebook that she has to deal with the fallout of.", "Now what does JAH means\nI think reddit is becoming wah too much complex for me", "So why not put e s h in your original comment", "Justified Ass Hole, and those are the one's you DO NOT apologize too.", "The often proposed and declined Justified AssHole - yes, they are an AH but it was justified due to provocation etc.\n\nMods state this is not a needed category as the current ones cover this.", "NTA", "Just curious, how do you think what you did affected your sister, her husband and the child?not just today but in the long run, because they are the people who matter.\n\nYou are a nobody in this story, you aren't raising this child, you aren't changing daily diapers or waking up at 2am. A few gift packages is nothing. What do you think the impact of your actions are or did you just not consider how much harder you are making this situation for the people doing the hard work. How does creating more tension that your sister needs to deal with help anyone?\n\nYou do realise as this child's godmother you are supposed to have their best interests in mind.

She deserves a grovelling apology for using her event to take cheap shots that make her ability to parent this child harder.", "YTA because passive-aggressive crap like this could 1) mess with the custody situation and 2) you don\u2019t post about someone else\u2019s kid without permission. In regards to #1, unless they have relinquished parental rights & your nephew has been adopted you don\u2019t freaking rock the boat.  Enough public shame or a new relationship and the bio-parents could come & want L back. \nLeave the public shame alone.", "ESH one side deadbeat another is passive aggressive AH good luck baby L.

He made a choice and very obviously loves himself more than his son.", "It's not his kid though. This is essentially his adopted brother now. Someone that he shares DNA with sure, but he's not obligated anymore. He signed those rights and obligations away.", "I think YTA because doing passive aggressive shit on social media can backfire legally on OP with the baby as victim. Taking in a child in circumstances is also a commitment to not start drama, because this type of drama (pointing out the biological parents are deadbeats) is incredibly damaging to the child\u2019s psyche.", "Exactly.  A post about how awesome the kid is is way better than one slamming the parents.  The kid is the one who will eventually have to deal with the backlash from that shit.", "NTA\n\nBut also, you knew what you were doing.", "NTA but your sister is enabling her son's bad behavior. He literally abandoned his son and she still gives him money. He's never going to learn if she keeps refusing to hold him accountable.", "I don't even see it as passive aggressive,  just a fact", "I completely disagree with you on this!!\n\nOP is NTA!  He made a 100% innocuous comment with the posted pictures.  He in no way called out the nephew.  The nephew has major issues, but the family should not have to walk on eggshells because of him.", "OP said they signed over custody, not adoption paperwork.
