I've been NC with my father for over two decades. The thing is he was an amazing dad the first 11 or so years of my life until my stepmother came along and permanently brought out his most toxic parts. Only recently has my mom's family started to tell me that they always felt there was something cold or off about my father. I'm still dealing with the cognitive dissonance of his having been both a great and then terrible father."]}
