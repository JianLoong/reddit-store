Long story short, I feel like *my* coming out was one of the causes to my parents divorce. Granted neither of my parents were spewing homophobic shit (mom is homophobic but has never outright said anything TOO bad), but that just adds to your brothers reaction. He may be 18, but I\u2019m 22 and *still* blame myself for the divorce.\n\nIn one conversation, your brother basically heard \u201cYou came out and it caused an argument, so they divorced because you came out.\u201d \u201cThat dad you really love? Homophobic as all hell.\u201d \u201cOh no one ever told you why they got divorced?

It's time for another sit down and patiently explain that your mother isn't to blame at all - it's entirely 100% your dad's fault for not accepting his kids as they are.", "NTA.

He'll probably move from that to his dad leaving because he hates him, and that's even worse. Be ready to repeat more accurate and reasonable takes on the situation as he needs to hear them.
