She often avoids mirrors and pictures because her mood instantly drains when she sees herself. She constantly asks her father and me if we think she's pretty and we always tell her the same thing, that she's a beautiful girl inside and out. As I understand how most teenage girls are with their body image as I was one at some point myself, my daughter's vanity is not only becoming exhausting to those around her, but I fear it's causing her to slowly lose herself.\n\nYesterday, I decided to sit her down to chat with her about this, to discuss what's bothering her, and to see if she's willing to visit a therapist. She told me she didn't want to talk about it, but as her mother, of course, I'm going to be worried about her, so I insisted. She finally agreed.\n\nA few minutes into this conversation, she asked exactly this, \"Mom, I want you to be completely honest with me. That means no sugarcoating. The kids at my school think I'm ugly and say I look like a bird because I have a big nose. Do you really think I'm beautiful, or are you just lying?\" I'm an honest person, so I gave her the most honest answer I had. I told her she was average-looking like most people in the world are, and that it's not a bad thing to have an average appearance. She immediately got up and left without saying a word and just went into her room for the rest of the night.\n\nToday, she has been cold and distant, and I think I upset her, which wasn't my intention at all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699056566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n931q/aita_for_telling_my_14yearold_daughter_that_shes/", "score": 4239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This seems to be a delicate topic for her.", "What most average looking people lack is style and confidence. They don't know how to dress in colours and styles that suit their figure. They have haircuts that don't really do anything for their face shape.  It doesn't help that 14 is a particularly awkward looking age where you haven't grown into your looks yet and are self conscious about it. She is transitioning from childish styles but has no idea what to do. And unfortunately, fashion magazines are the worst possible resource with both the models and expense completely unrealistic for a normal person. You need resources that teach her how to dress. I read \"Colour Me Beautiful\" as a 90s teen who only wore jeans and t-shirts, and it changed everything. There are probably newer books which have more modern styling when discussing clothes that suit body shape but the point is help her find resources that help her find a sense of style and what looks good. Her nose is going to haunt her while she wants to look like everyone else. When she is older and secure in herself, she will realise that life is far more interesting to be fascinating rather than pretty like a princess. You can do something about lacking style. You can not do anything with being told you are average and that is just how it is.", "YTA\u2014I\u2019m 32 and still remember things my parents (and others) said about the way I look.

I'm sorry for what I said and that wasn't nice of me to say. Please know that I wasn't trying to be mean or hurt your feelings. You have to realize that the kids who are calling you ugly and are pointing out your big nose is because they are just as insecure about themselves that they need to direct their insecurities towards someone else to make themselves feel better.

At 30 you can have that discussion. \n\nAt 14, this is a very vulnerable age, where she is discovering feelings for the opposite (or same) sex. And she would like that reciprocated.

How could you, as a parent, confirm what your daughter is being bullied about to be true? Even though you didn't call her ugly or unattractive, average is essentially a sugar-coated version of that. Knowing that she's also deeply insecure, you just reaffirmed in her mind that she's not deluded, and is in fact, as ugly as she thinks she is.

OP, my mother picked at something in my appearance every day that I saw her. She screamed at me for hours whenever she had a bad day.

But perhaps diverting the conversation to helping her realize that beauty is subjective and what is important is how she view herself. There are some sexy people who aren\u2019t attractive but carry themselves well. Attitude and self confidence are key. This may not have been the best time for brutal honesty. \n\nAnother observation: good for you for taking an interest in your daughter. Your daughter is at the age where her peer group holds more weight and importance than her parents. As a parent I am learning that giving kids space and letting them talk when they are ready instead of insisting on \u201cwe need to talk\u201d may be more productive. I might have approached her with how you dealt with body image or self confidence and letting her jump in on the conversation when she was ready. \n\nWe are all learning this parenting thing and this age isn\u2019t easy. Good luck.", "It's true that most people aren't \"beautiful\" in the same kind of way that models or actors are, but there's a different kind of beauty that comes through in the unique features that people have, that perhaps only a few will appreciate. \n\nIt might sound like a deflection to tell your daughter that she's \"beautiful in her own way\" or something, but if you can personally focus on how she's unique without comparing her to anybody else's standards, you can absolutely say she's beautiful without being dishonest at all. \n\nAnd somewhere down the line if she enters a relationship, her partner would also call her beautiful - not based on the standards of what their high-schooler friends think, but because of the unique features that they appreciate.", "Maybe your wording was a bit misleading.

From the other end of the spectrum they will convince themselves \u201cmy nose is ugly I need to fix this\u201d and in a self deprecating way seek confirmation. They want to be reassured it\u2019s not true but however it would also confirm that their negative thought patterns aren\u2019t just a figment of their imagination. Its not a very logical thought pattern. Some people are saying this question was loaded and it kind of is but not because she was seeking absolute brutal unsugar coated honestly but because she\u2019s struggling with what is an actual depiction of how others see her and she sees herself. She needed at least some reassurance her nose isn\u2019t like a birds (and it\u2019s important to not attribute \u201cgood and bad\u201d \u201cugly and beautiful\u201d to body parts as perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards or that certain qualities are more ideal just contributes to body issues. But she really just wanted to be seen not given some \u201coh your beautiful\u201d or \u201cyou are normal\u201d  she wanted a genuine response but not also to be put down because that insecurity is still there. I understand this is very complex. \n\nBut the best way to put body dysmorphia is that it\u2019s a skewed perception of one\u2019s image, coupled with negative thoughts and anxiety, illogical thinking. You are presented with image A someone gives you image B when in reality it\u2019s Image C and no matter what someone\u2019s says or when presented with accurate logical info it\u2019s difficult to see Image C as reality", "They had plenty of alternatives.

Deflecting the question is as good as telling her she\u2019s not beautiful. \n\nA better response would be: \u2018I love you and, to me, you are so beautiful. But people can be very judgmental about looks. What is beautiful to one person is not beautiful to another. And how a person is on the inside will change how people view them on the outside too. So you focus on being the best person you can be for yourself, not for anyone else.\u2019", "YES! that's exactly what I was thinking reading the post. being \"beautiful\" is so subjective, but being a decent person who knows their value and celebrates themselves for their human qualities is much more important.", "Is it a lie though?

We did things *very* differently in the past-there was a WHOLE different set of circumstances-and a vastly different set of results.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have any social media, and there was not hundreds of friends and strangers online ripping the shit out of your looks every minute of the day. Yes, there was *horrendous* bullying, and there were cases of girls committing suicide, self harming or becoming anorexic.\n\nI went to a very large school that was considered one of the roughest in the South of England. The bullying was unremitting-and I was a particular target. You see, I was catnip to the bullies. I was very tall (I literally \u201cstood out in the crowd\u201d), I was fat (by today\u2019s standards I was probably average-but in the 1960s and 1970s, I was FAR bigger than average), I was a \u201cclever swat\u201d, gobby and \u201cposh\u201d. That\u2019s what the bullies screamed at me every time I walked around the school. Oh, yes: I was also \u201cugly\u201d.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t very nice to have that-I can remember the pain of it, and I\u2019m not here to discuss it. Many kids in my position left the school because of it, but honestly (luckily) I was fine. I\u2019m still not particularly detrimentally affected by it (but that\u2019s another story).\n\nBack then, in my HUGE school, where everyone knew everything about everyone else, do you know how many girls I knew-and knew of-who were anorexic? How many self-harmed? How many suicides? I knew -and heard of- *NONE*. Not a single one. You \n\nI personally knew a girl who had a psychological problem (that was caused by academic perfectionism). But other than that, I knew of no mental illnesses.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying there *were* none. All this kind of thing was \u201chushed up\u201d back then. But I did hear of other pupils\u2019 other types of struggles. But not eating disorders and self-harm. It\u2019s not something that, today, could be hidden, because it\u2019s so prevalent, so there *must* have been an order of magnitude fewer of them.\n\nCoincidentally, do you know how many times I was told as a child that I was \u201cbeautiful\u201d? Zero. I was NEVER told I was beautiful, because I wasn\u2019t. None of my friends (except the truly beautiful one) was told this either. It just simply wasn\u2019t \u201cthe done thing\u201d to tell a child they were beautiful-unless they were completely captivating. Even then, it often didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not sure that Janet (the \u201cbeautiful\u201d friend) was EVER told that by her parents. And did we \u201csuffer\u201d from this? No, not at all. It never occurred to us.\n\nMy mother (not a cruel woman) would NEVER have told *any* child that they were something they weren\u2019t because (in her words) \u201cwhen a child grows up and finds it isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s an awful realisation for them.\u201d\n\nMy poor brother, for example, had a serious medical condition that the doctors *insisted* he would \u201cgrow out of\u201d. When, at age 15, it became apparent that he wouldn\u2019t, he had a kind of a breakdown.\n\nIf your whole existence is predicated on a lie, when you discover that, there\u2019s a kind of grief. In my day, beauty really wasn\u2019t considered the be-all-and-end all. We accepted that it was something enjoyed by a vanishingly small number of people, and the rest of us would make ourselves attractive, sexy and fascinating in different ways. Or some of us decided to do something a bit more important than just think of ourselves as \u201cfailed to be beautiful\u201d.\n\nToday, the pressures on young people are MASSIVE. Our daughter was actually hospitalised for anorexia. Everywhere you look, people have anorexia, are self harming, and suicides are rife. And everywhere young people are putting their looks front and centre of everything.\n\nI don\u2019t have the answer to anything. But I can say this: the modern idea that telling a child that they are beautiful does NOT inoculate them against bullying and unhappiness about their appearance. In fact, the placing of beauty as the pinnacle of everything that is important in life is CLEARLY not working. If we need to help our children (and I think we really do), we need to help them relegate physical beauty into the side issue it deserves to be. The privilege of the fortunate few: irrelevant to sensible people who don\u2019t happen to possess it.\n\nThe OP might or might not be the AH for telling her daughter she\u2019s not beautiful, but frankly, that girl probably already knows. The problem is a much wider one, caused by society: the \u201cworship\u201d of beauty itself.", "YTA. Growing up, I was like this too as a teen. I had extremely low self-esteem, and was terrified of going out without a large sunhat that concealed my face. If I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror I would just cry. My mum also thought it was 'vanity'. Turns out I had appearance-based OCD, that was causing extreme body dysmorphia, which was not helped by the bullying I experienced. I didn't find out about my OCD until adulthood when I was visibly sick (90lbs) because I was starving myself trying to find the perfect 'healthy' beautifying diet. All my mom had to offer me as a teen when I said I was too embarrassed to show my face outside was 'You think you're that important? It's not like the paparazzi is watching you.' Maybe she considered it honesty, but it stuck with me and it hurt. There aren't a lot of things that are worse than hating yourself so much that you want to die, and realizing that the people you love the most STILL think that you think too highly of yourself. All I got from my own mum's statement was that, I wasn't worth enough for it to even matter what I looked like. It made me feel subhuman. It would have been much better for you to find beautiful historical figures or paintings that looked like your daughter. Almost everyone is beautiful in a unique way, even if it isn't modern conventional beauty. And, more importantly, to have got her therapy. She's a minor, she may be embarrassed or not fully understand how much it can benefit her. If a child NEEDS to go to the doctor, you don't ask them whether or not they want to go. You just take them.", "good grief.\n\nWhen my youngest daughter was 15 and started getting touchy about her looks i brought out my yearbook from my sophomore year in high school and showed her all of the most popular and seemingly attractive people that had made me feel mousy and \"average\".

Most of them had not aged well in one way or another and were at their best between ages 16-20.                         Then I showed her my sophomore photo and she looked at me and said: \"Geez mom you really grew into your looks, didn't you?\"  \n\nThus, my point was made, and she never stressed on her looks again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suggest you find a new approach with your daughter.
