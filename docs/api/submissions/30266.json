She often avoids mirrors and pictures because her mood instantly drains when she sees herself. She constantly asks her father and me if we think she's pretty and we always tell her the same thing, that she's a beautiful girl inside and out. As I understand how most teenage girls are with their body image as I was one at some point myself, my daughter's vanity is not only becoming exhausting to those around her, but I fear it's causing her to slowly lose herself.\n\nYesterday, I decided to sit her down to chat with her about this, to discuss what's bothering her, and to see if she's willing to visit a therapist. She told me she didn't want to talk about it, but as her mother, of course, I'm going to be worried about her, so I insisted. She finally agreed.\n\nA few minutes into this conversation, she asked exactly this, \"Mom, I want you to be completely honest with me. That means no sugarcoating. The kids at my school think I'm ugly and say I look like a bird because I have a big nose. Do you really think I'm beautiful, or are you just lying?\" I'm an honest person, so I gave her the most honest answer I had. I told her she was average-looking like most people in the world are, and that it's not a bad thing to have an average appearance. She immediately got up and left without saying a word and just went into her room for the rest of the night.\n\nToday, she has been cold and distant, and I think I upset her, which wasn't my intention at all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699056566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n931q/aita_for_telling_my_14yearold_daughter_that_shes/", "score": 1637, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This seems to be a delicate topic for her.", "What most average looking people lack is style and confidence. They don't know how to dress in colours and styles that suit their figure. They have haircuts that don't really do anything for their face shape.  It doesn't help that 14 is a particularly awkward looking age where you haven't grown into your looks yet and are self conscious about it. She is transitioning from childish styles but has no idea what to do. And unfortunately, fashion magazines are the worst possible resource with both the models and expense completely unrealistic for a normal person. You need resources that teach her how to dress. I read \"Colour Me Beautiful\" as a 90s teen who only wore jeans and t-shirts, and it changed everything. There are probably newer books which have more modern styling when discussing clothes that suit body shape but the point is help her find resources that help her find a sense of style and what looks good. Her nose is going to haunt her while she wants to look like everyone else. When she is older and secure in herself, she will realise that life is far more interesting to be fascinating rather than pretty like a princess. You can do something about lacking style. You can not do anything with being told you are average and that is just how it is.", "YTA\u2014I\u2019m 32 and still remember things my parents (and others) said about the way I look.

I'm sorry for what I said and that wasn't nice of me to say. Please know that I wasn't trying to be mean or hurt your feelings. You have to realize that the kids who are calling you ugly and are pointing out your big nose is because they are just as insecure about themselves that they need to direct their insecurities towards someone else to make themselves feel better.

At 30 you can have that discussion. \n\nAt 14, this is a very vulnerable age, where she is discovering feelings for the opposite (or same) sex. And she would like that reciprocated.

How could you, as a parent, confirm what your daughter is being bullied about to be true? Even though you didn't call her ugly or unattractive, average is essentially a sugar-coated version of that. Knowing that she's also deeply insecure, you just reaffirmed in her mind that she's not deluded, and is in fact, as ugly as she thinks she is.

OP, my mother picked at something in my appearance every day that I saw her. She screamed at me for hours whenever she had a bad day.

But perhaps diverting the conversation to helping her realize that beauty is subjective and what is important is how she view herself. There are some sexy people who aren\u2019t attractive but carry themselves well. Attitude and self confidence are key. This may not have been the best time for brutal honesty. \n\nAnother observation: good for you for taking an interest in your daughter. Your daughter is at the age where her peer group holds more weight and importance than her parents. As a parent I am learning that giving kids space and letting them talk when they are ready instead of insisting on \u201cwe need to talk\u201d may be more productive. I might have approached her with how you dealt with body image or self confidence and letting her jump in on the conversation when she was ready. \n\nWe are all learning this parenting thing and this age isn\u2019t easy. Good luck.", "It's true that most people aren't \"beautiful\" in the same kind of way that models or actors are, but there's a different kind of beauty that comes through in the unique features that people have, that perhaps only a few will appreciate. \n\nIt might sound like a deflection to tell your daughter that she's \"beautiful in her own way\" or something, but if you can personally focus on how she's unique without comparing her to anybody else's standards, you can absolutely say she's beautiful without being dishonest at all. \n\nAnd somewhere down the line if she enters a relationship, her partner would also call her beautiful - not based on the standards of what their high-schooler friends think, but because of the unique features that they appreciate.", "Maybe your wording was a bit misleading.

From the other end of the spectrum they will convince themselves \u201cmy nose is ugly I need to fix this\u201d and in a self deprecating way seek confirmation. They want to be reassured it\u2019s not true but however it would also confirm that their negative thought patterns aren\u2019t just a figment of their imagination. Its not a very logical thought pattern. Some people are saying this question was loaded and it kind of is but not because she was seeking absolute brutal unsugar coated honestly but because she\u2019s struggling with what is an actual depiction of how others see her and she sees herself. She needed at least some reassurance her nose isn\u2019t like a birds (and it\u2019s important to not attribute \u201cgood and bad\u201d \u201cugly and beautiful\u201d to body parts as perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards or that certain qualities are more ideal just contributes to body issues. But she really just wanted to be seen not given some \u201coh your beautiful\u201d or \u201cyou are normal\u201d  she wanted a genuine response but not also to be put down because that insecurity is still there. I understand this is very complex. \n\nBut the best way to put body dysmorphia is that it\u2019s a skewed perception of one\u2019s image, coupled with negative thoughts and anxiety, illogical thinking. You are presented with image A someone gives you image B when in reality it\u2019s Image C and no matter what someone\u2019s says or when presented with accurate logical info it\u2019s difficult to see Image C as reality", "They had plenty of alternatives. Didn't even have to answer.", "This is all correct, but that\u2019s the long game. Today was definitely not the day, and that moment DEFINITELY not the moment. hopefully she can get that therapy appt on the schedule soon, because yikes.", "This really going to help this child to gain self acceptance, yup, right.\n\nWhat it will gain her is for the rest of her life hearing these words overlaying her mother saying \" your beautiful\"\n\nAt her prom\n\nAt her graduation\n\nAt her wedding\n\nAnd any other occasion like that. She will never believe her mother, because her mother told their the \"honest\" truth when she was 14 years old and wanted reassurance from someone she trusted", "Yeah, but you\u2019re supposed to be beautiful to your parents. That\u2019s the one time bias is totally acceptable.", "I understand. But it does matter to her. Deflecting the question is as good as telling her she\u2019s not beautiful. \n\nA better response would be: \u2018I love you and, to me, you are so beautiful. But people can be very judgmental about looks. What is beautiful to one person is not beautiful to another. And how a person is on the inside will change how people view them on the outside too. So you focus on being the best person you can be for yourself, not for anyone else.\u2019", "YES! that's exactly what I was thinking reading the post. being \"beautiful\" is so subjective, but being a decent person who knows their value and celebrates themselves for their human qualities is much more important.", "Is it a lie though? We don\u2019t know. \n\nAlso, what is the context of their relationship? Does she resent her daughter, does she see her as competition? \n\nBeauty is so subjective. As a parent, your job is to build your children up. The reality is, there are lots of ugly kids that are told they are beautiful by their parents. But ugly kids aren\u2019t stupid. They know what they look like. It isn\u2019t about being pretty, so much as it is about how your parents see you. \n\nImagine your parent saw you as just \u2018average.\u2019 \nParents are supposed to be biased. That\u2019s why it hurts and why OP is wrong.", "She asked for honesty from her mother. \n\nHere\u2019s honest, if you don\u2019t see your child as being beautiful, you have issues. \n\nImagine your own mother not thinking you\u2019re beautiful.", "Because that\u2019s her mum. Mums are supposed to be biased and put their kids on a pedestal above everyone else. That\u2019s why. \n\nShe wasnt looking for an objective answer (even though, objectively her mother should see her as beautiful anyway), she was looking for her mother to build her up.", "you should bring this back up to him one day as an adult. Sometimes parents can see it differently a few years out", "I usually encourage people to talk to their parents, especially as adults, about this stuff. Sometimes they are able to see it differently a few years late, but that man ws just trying to bully you bc wtf", "\u201cHoney, I wish you could see what I see when I look at you. I see a beautiful young lady inside and out with a heart of gold and incredible strength, a joy to everyone who knows her. Maybe one day you will see the beauty that I see in you and I pray that you will. Until then, know that I wholeheartedly believe it for the both of us.\u201d\n\nYou could have asked me.", "Avoiding the question would have almost certainly gotten the wrong message across.", "Okay, i understand your point on how it should have gone, and i agree. However, it didn't go that way and given the context we have, it's hard to say the mum is an asshole. She did exactly what her daughter asked, she didn't lie. Who knows? Maybe lying to her daughter today would result in bullshit down the line regarding dishonesty. \n\nBy the same token the daughter could be an asshole, putting her mother in a situation where she has been asked not to lie to her daughter's face that she is already concerned about become too obsessed with her looks. This clearly wasn't the first time the topic had been discussed either, she already built her up multiple times with \"you're beautiful inside and out\". Plus, being told \"you're just like everyone else\" isn't the insult everyone here seems to think it is.", "Yeah, Heaven forbid being an adult and instead turning the questions back around on the daughter and taking control to help instead of hurt.  \n\nAnd you basically saying \"it was all going to cause trouble\" doesn't make the mum less of AH for the path she chose.", "No but her post indicates she things of her daughters body issues as a burden and annoyance framed as her being worried about her. The way she approached it and the language implies she wants to shove it under the rug rather than deal with it"]}
