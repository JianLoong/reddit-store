My sister Jane (43F) has been vocally outspoken about her disgust at our decision. She told us that Ever being adopted, she should be thinking of adoption before any form of fertility treatment.

She has focused most of her ire on Ever and I have stepped in each and every time and told her to knock it off, and to keep her opinions to herself.\n\nShe questions Ever every step of the way about rejecting adoption and how her family must feel to know she would rather have her own bio baby instead of adopting when they adopted her. Ever opened up to Jane, which is something I did not think she needed to and I told Ever as much but she wanted to. She told Jane that adoption is not always an ethical option and while it can be such an amazing thing and bring so much joy to everyone, adoption is nowhere close to perfect. She also opened up about feeling on the outside her whole life because she looked like nobody and her family would always pass comments about her siblings (bio kids of her parents) looked like family members and comments were often made about \"twins\" meaning lookalikes. How as the only kid who never got that and the kid who was different, it weighs on you. She said her parents and siblings loved her as their own and she loved them.

She told Jane she can have that, it will just cost, but she could not in good conscience adopt when it would be her last choice. Jane called her names and told her she was disgusting and should be ashamed for viewing things this way.\n\nEver was so upset after talking to Jane.

Is it possible your sister is jealous because you could have biological kids via IVF, and she couldn't?", "NTA and please protect your wife from Jane. Jane is clearly taking her own insecurities out on other people. \n\nI'm an adult adoptee and NOBODY should adopt unless they have the personal desire to do so. There is nothing wrong with trying to have biological children. My adoptive parents are fantastic, they raised me with love and I'm so grateful to them. But adoption is not easy! Adopting babies is hard, expensive, often falls through, and as you said, is often unethical. I chose to have my own biological children and was fortunate to be able to do that. \n\nPlus, obviously you know this, but adopting older children means those children often need serious care and support that not everyone is equipped to give, especially new parents. I'm parenting two biological children, and it's been a huge learning curve. There really is something a biological bond makes easier--I can sometimes understand them easier because they have some similar traits to me and my husband. I think I'm now emotionally equipped to foster or adopt a child with difficult needs, but I would not have been as a new parent at 24. For awhile, I had this dream of adopting older children who desperately needed homes. I'm so glad I didn't do that in my early 20s--it would have been terrible for them, I was not capable of parenting children with complex needs at that time in my life and with no experience with children. (Some people are! No shame to younger parents. I just personally was not there yet.) There are a lot of very valid reasons to choose fertility treatments over adoption and nobody should judge others for that. \n\nI wonder if some of Jane's attitude is misplaced jealousy or anger because you might be able to have what she couldn't, which is a biological child? I don't know her situation or what her adoption experience was, but it might have been difficult, because it often is. That doesn't mean everyone needs to go through those same difficulties, though.

They have a whole other family that plays a part in their identity. Of course things get complicated with donor IVF, but there is a big difference in I donated an egg versus I made you and grew you in my stomach, then selflessly gave you to another family. Doesn\u2019t make adoption any less, but you have to consider that it can be harder on the child. Your wife being adopted means that she recognizes those nuances. \n\nI\u2019m hoping IVF works out for you OP!

Because of that, she's hearing Ever explain that growing up as an adoptee wasn't actually all sunshine and roses, and that it had real, negative impacts on her regardless of the fact that she was in a good home, and Jane is interpreting that as a personal attack towards her own choices in adopting children and a condemnation of her specifically. She's reacting so strongly because the issue isn't that she wants y'all to adopt, but that she **needs** you to adopt to prove to herself that adoption is definitely 100% good for the adopted children and she's a good person for having done so. By choosing to not adopt, Ever (in Jane's mind) is making some kind of declaration that adoption is wrong and those who do adopt are wrong and bad people for doing so.\n\nBasically I would bet my left butt cheek that the whole reason Jane is so caught up in forcing this on Ever(and OP) is because if she can get The Girl Who Was Adopted to adopt kids of her own, then it must mean that there are no downsides to adoption and she can continue believing that her choice to adopt was 100% morally correct with absolutely no possibility of causing any kind of harm. \n\nObviously, even if this sort of mindset is where it's stemming from, it still doesn't give Jane any right to berate and come after y'all for this.

That includes agency fees, attorneys fees, etc. and if the bio-mom backs out at any time (which she would have all rights to do so), the potential parents are out all that money.

If it's about having a child and adding to your family, why does it HAVE to be yours, no matter what. No the kiddo won't have the same facial features, but kids adapt to their families. Adopted children often take on the same facial expressions, the way they walk, and other qualities from their parents.\n\nIvf is never a one and done situation, often it's 3 rounds before it actually works.

I had fertility issues and we planned on adopting if the pregnancy that became my son was a miscarriage. My good friend had many problems and ended up adopting.

On top of all of that, clinics have been caught out *grossly* exceeding guidelines about how many children it is reasonable to create from a single donor, with some \"pods\" containing *over one thousand people* all sharing the same biological parent and many more in the hundreds of siblings range. It's also not technically illegal through most of the US for clinics to use different samples than the recipient parents believe are being used to create their embryos, resulting in a few quite prominent cases where fertility doctors have been found to be replacing patients and/or donor semen with their own - again creating huge pods of related people who don't have accurate information about their origins. There are multiple groups working to bring attention to these issues and get legislation in place to regulate the industry. Much of what I have learned is via Laura High on TikTok, she's a DCP and passionate advocate for making donor conception safe and ethical. \n\nThat being said there are certainly other areas of the fertility industry that can and do operate with questionable ethics but I believe that's mostly on individual doctors rather than being such a widespread issue. e.g. Nadya Suleman's doctor.", "I believe some on the particularly extreme end of the religious scale also consider it unethical because some of the embryos end up discarded.", "Thank you.

I was an egg donor so much less of an issue for me. Lol", "IVF doesn\u2019t have to use donor eggs or sperm. It\u2019s simply the process of *manually* making sure eggs are fertilized (and healthy) before implantation. This can be for any number of reasons, inc fertility.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly common to use eggs & sperm from both parents, in fact probably the majority of cases.", "This is an issue, but more for the older generation. Historically the clinics had much fewer ethics and would go nuts.\n\nMy home country (Australia, 10) and state(5) now have limits . Either unofficial, or by law.", "I\u2019m an adoptee. \nYou\u2019re doing right by your wife, you\u2019re not an AH. Jane was way out of line.", "I think this too! Jane is jealous and hasn't reconciled with her decision with regard to adoption. This kind of reaction usually has nothing to do with other people choice but their own \ud83d\ude1e.", "It\u2019s not even a guarantee that IVF will work for OP and his wife. Jane seems to have the mindset of \u201cif I can\u2019t have it, you can\u2019t either\u201d", "Exactly this. I bet she\u2019s worried her adopted kids will feel the EXACT same thing Ever talked about growing up, and she\u2019s spitting mad that her brother will have the \u201clook alike\u201d family member when she won\u2019t. It\u2019s vile.", "It's both. And more. I get the impression that Jane is projecting her self-worth onto her adopted kid (and therefore the process by which it was attained). It's called a Redemption Fantasy: if the kid grows up to be  \"successful\", she'll have \"proven' to herself that she was right, and therefore, not flawed.\n\nEver having a biological kid would, in Jane's mind, invalidate her 'control group', so to speak. It seems to me Jane could be the type of person who only sees other people for the qualities they can reflect back about themselves.", "Which was Jane's experience lol. The irony", "NTA.\n\nYour family size and method of obtaining it is nobody else's business but yours and Ever's (pretty name btw).\n\nI totally understand Ever's perspective.\n\nIt truly is altruistic to think that as an adopted child she would be most likely to want to adopt.\n\nI don't agree. I was adopted into a family that had one older adopted child and three more biological children. It wasn't until 2 1/2 years ago, in my 60s, that I received a photograph of my birth mother. It was the first time in my entire life that I had seen a picture of someone that I looked like.\n\nUnless Jane can say that when her mother gave birth to her she gave her away, she needs to keep her damn mouth shut.\n\nAdoption has its perks. As your wife does, I adore my family. They are my people. The others? They're relatives, not my family. My family are the ones who raised me.\n\nBut nobody knows but an adopted child what's like to know that your birth mother gave birth to you and said, \"No\".\n\nIf you are as awesome a husband as you seem to be, you will shut this conversation down anytime.Jane brings it up and limit contact between the cousins because I have no doubt that Jane will not keep her mouth shut to them either.", "Tbh, Ever went that extra mile to really try and help Jane understand her position, but Jane just used that soul-baring moment to lacerate Ever.\n\nWhatever any member of that family thinks about adoption or IVF personally is irrelevant \u2014 Jane needs to be stopped.\n\nShe\u2019s not acting in good faith. You don\u2019t treat people you claim to love this way.", "I was thinking about that too. Also when Ever opened up about how hard it was for her as an adopted kid, I have to believe that Jane was terrified her own adopted children might have similar challenges and difficulties. No mother wants to hear she may have caused her children to suffer.\n\nOP and Ever are saying IVF is better. Jane is saying adoption is better. Really everyone needs to stop arguing and start celebrating the children in their family.", "Great logic there. Let\u2019s outlaw people having children until every child is adopted, then.\n\nThis is sarcasm, by the way.", "How many children have you adopted, sad-mode-52?", "It's actually pretty funny.. The anti abortion crowd doesn't ever care about IVF but if life is started at conception, then IVF is like having dozen abortions everytime you try. Basically try to get as many eggs and fertilise them as they can and then inject them to see if they take. \n\nWhere's the uproar from the pro life crowd?", "With respect OP, for your sister this is not about Ever\u2019s experience. This is about Jane\u2019s emotions. The other commenter pointing at resentment and envy, rather than jealousy, are hitting close to the mark. But there\u2019s more going on than the corrosive \u201cIf I can\u2019t have it, Ever can\u2019t either\u201d sentiment that comes with those emotions. Many emotionally damaged and/or immature people, cannot tell the difference between conflict and abuse. This usually applies equally to both interpersonal conflict and internal conflict. When in a conflict situation they feel attacked (often as though their identity is under threat of some sort of annihilation) so in their mind they are being attacked. Jane clearly has a lot of internal conflict about her fertility and adoption that she cannot reconcile herself.\nThat\u2019s why her behaviour is so out of proportion. It\u2019s driven by extreme emotions and since it\u2019s not rational there is no hope for yours or Ever\u2019s arguments to prevail. Anything you say is perceived as invalidating and an attack on her. Expect Jane to double down if you continue to try to resolve this.", "This isn\u2019t about logic. Jane is jealous that Ever can have bio kids and she can\u2019t. Sure, it\u2019ll take IVF. But Jane didn\u2019t have that option. It sounds like she\u2019s mad at Ever for having healthy eggs, when Jane\u2019s were totally not viable (I\u2019m guessing, given even a surrogate was not an option).\n\nI\u2019ve been in Ever\u2019s position, with a childless SIL who hated me - but not my husband - for having children when she didn\u2019t. Just go NC with Jane; there\u2019s no reasoning with jealousy, so don\u2019t bother trying to explain further. Jane doesn\u2019t really care about adoption vs. IVF; she just doesn\u2019t want someone else to have what she can\u2019t get.", "My mom was adopted and she still talks to this day about how surreal and marvelous it felt when she had me (her first child and only girl) and everyone kept exclaiming over how much I looked like her. It's definitely a big deal for a lot of adoptees.", "Where do the rest of your family stand? Are they supporting you and also telling Jane to stay in her lane?", "It's nobody's business what OP and wife do but the reasoning doesn't make sense to me.\nAdoption was no picnic because adoptive parents left them feeling like an outsider .. okay so...  just leave those kids In a group home then?\nIsn't the issue the shitty parents in this story, Not adoption itself?\n\nI don't think anyone should be pushed to adopt but you're not doing kids any favours by leaving them in the alternative  to adoption.", "I would take this suggestion with caution if only because I hate to think of her children not having access to supportive, understanding, adoption-competent adults. Without you and Enver, they are on their own.", "The anti IVF stance is gaining traction with the anti abortion crowd, unfortunately.", "That's my point, there shouldn't be a 'each and every time'. Your sister seems to feel very confident ignoring your \"knock it off\" protestations...\n\nI'm being down voted, so maybe I'm wrong, I just can't remotely imagine any of my family getting to disrespect my wife *repeatedly*. Feels weak to me.", "I very much did, try and read my response!\n\nMy point is that this should have been dealt with the first time and not allowed to repeat.\n\nTells them to \"knock it off\" and sister just keeps doing it? Weak. Clearly not defending his wife well enough.", "Regardless of the success stories, the studies show that adoption is traumatic and not the fairy tale perfect ending everyone wants you to believe it is. Your sister is just pushing for you to do what she did because that makes what she did right.", "Thank you for saying this.", "Also, the primary goal for foster kids is to be able to place them back with their bio parents. If that doesn't work out, the next option looked into is the extended bio family. If kids are available to be adopted by strangers, oftentimes they have experienced severe trauma and have higher needs (physical, mental, and behavioral) than children on average. If they have [FASDs](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/features/neurobehavioral-disorder-alcohol.html) or other similar disabilities, adoptive parents should be prepared for the chance that they will be [unable to live independently as adults](https://fasdsocalnetwork.org/independent-living/).\n\nMany adoptive parents [fall in love with these kids](https://www.calhealthreport.org/2022/04/21/how-families-are-advocating-for-children-with-disabilities-in-foster-care/) and are not deterred by the special needs, but that may not be the same kind of person who only looked into adopting because they had fertility issues. It's just not the same path for many reasons. \n\nLuckily, the [rate of children entering foster care for the first time decreased](https://www.calhealthreport.org/2022/04/21/how-families-are-advocating-for-children-with-disabilities-in-foster-care/) from 1998 to 2018. Hopefully, we won't see that progress reversed in states that reduced reproductive rights.", "There are lots of adoptees who can address your valid concerns better than me. \n\nI will try to give you my very surface level understanding, with the caveat that adoptee voices should always overrule anything I relay. \n\nI should have been clearer that my original comment was about infant adoption in the US. There are problems with foster adoption as well, but that's a very different set of moral quandaries. I implied infant adoption because that was the subject of the OP's post. \n\nWith infant adoption particularly, a couple of the salient issues are:\n\n- Adults try to soothe their own infertility trauma by adopting an infant.\n\nThe adult thinks a baby will \"fix\" what is wrong, but the underlying issues are never addressed. Instead, they're projected onto the child. This leads to uniquely adoption-centered trauma.  Not that kids in their biological families never have trauma, of course! This particular set of trauma is valid though and only happens because of adoption. \n\n- People pay tens of thousands of dollars to obtain a human\n\nThere's another word that describes that exact transaction (trafficking).  I know that's a very dramatic comparison, but that doesn't make it wrong. U.S. Infant adoption has been very normalized, but it really is a complete outlier versus the rest of the world.\n\nI hear you when you say group homes are not a great alternative to adoption. I agree with you, full stop. \n\nWe need a better option, a third option. Something that is not as dramatic as orphanages nor cutting all legal ties to birth families. We need a solution that is centered on what the children need, what is best for the children. Adoption is centered on adults-who-want-babies.\n\nI wish I had the right answers. I do not.  I do think that bringing up the problems with adoption is something that I wish I had thought of earlier in my life. \n\nThere's a whole slew of TikTok adoptee creators, which I'm happy to recommend if you're interested.", "Thank you for this very thorough comment. \n\nI follow Laura as well, one of her videos was how I started learning about DC. \n\nIt\u2019s very interesting seeing the overlaps of the fertility industry and the adoption industry and unfortunately, the common unethical practices in both.", "This!!!", "Exactly. A lot of people don\u2019t seem to understand that all adoption starts in trauma. Every single one. There are no exceptions.\n\nSurrogacy & egg / sperm donation too. These can come with a really complex range of issues. Selective reductions when folks are pregnant with multiples as well.\n\nI\u2019m not judging anyone\u2019s choices. Just sayin that shit\u2019s complicated.", "Haha kind of. (But like a good way and not a creepy way)", "Yes, that, too. We did both preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A) and the normal 12 week genetic testing (NIPT).", "Never said that. I asked about how he was telling his sister to stop harassing his wife. For Jane to keep on saying what she has been saying, she isn't taking what he is saying seriously. Jane would not be around nor talk to my wife and I until she changes herself. I don't understand how you got what you said from what I said.", "Agreed, litt3lli0n. Wonder how many of these folks have adopted - or if they're just natural AH with PhDs in projection. So sad.", "She needs counseling before her child catches onto how bitter she is that she had to adopt... it is quite sad.", "As a mother of twins, I always find the idea of separating twins at birth absolutely vile. The bond between multiples who've experienced their earliest moments of sentience together is absolutely unparalleled. It's not just an identicals thing, either. My girls are 4 now and there truly aren't words that could ever adequately portray the relationship they have with each other. Nobody will ever, in their entire lives, know those girls as well as they know each other. Not even me.", "Possibly also that Jane desperately needs validation that adoption was the right choice", "This is exactly what I was thinking while.reading this too...she sounds VERY jealous.", "Exactly! This has absolutely nothing to do with adoption. Jane is just jealous as fuck that IVF is an option for Ever when it wasn\u2019t an option for her.\n\nJane needs some serious therapy before she totally screws up her kid.", "I agree Jane is Jealous\u2026 this rips a woman down to her core when she can\u2019t do this.  At some point she saw or was told that she isn\u2019t enough if she can\u2019t do this \u2026 now this is how she is\u2026 a nasty person.", "Ding ding ding!!", "That's exactly what she has. (adoptee here.)     Her poor children, for really real.", "Funny thing is it wasn't at birth. They were around 2. The way I heard it was Grandma's husband died, too many mouths to feed, hard choices had to be made.  \nEdit for clarity: these are Greats I'm talking about, so this would have been early 1950s.", "Thank you. As a twin mom myself I thought the same. Mine are 2 years old. They are connected in a way I can't describe. When one of them is sick and can't attend daycare, the other one will ask constantly about their sibling and talk a lot about why they can't be with them. When they finally meet, they won't stop touching and hugging each other. They hate being separated.\n\nThinking about separating them for life breaks my heart.
