We are unable to have children together naturally. Our fertility doctor has said our best chance at having biological children is IVF and we are now working our butts off to make that happen for us.\n\nMy family is aware of our struggles to conceive and they know we have decided to pursue IVF. My sister Jane (43F) has been vocally outspoken about her disgust at our decision. She told us that Ever being adopted, she should be thinking of adoption before any form of fertility treatment. She has ranted about how IVF is unethical and how we are going to fuck our kids up for life. She has focused most of her ire on Ever and I have stepped in each and every time and told her to knock it off, and to keep her opinions to herself.\n\nShe questions Ever every step of the way about rejecting adoption and how her family must feel to know she would rather have her own bio baby instead of adopting when they adopted her. Ever opened up to Jane, which is something I did not think she needed to and I told Ever as much but she wanted to. She told Jane that adoption is not always an ethical option and while it can be such an amazing thing and bring so much joy to everyone, adoption is nowhere close to perfect. She also opened up about feeling on the outside her whole life because she looked like nobody and her family would always pass comments about her siblings (bio kids of her parents) looked like family members and comments were often made about \"twins\" meaning lookalikes. How as the only kid who never got that and the kid who was different, it weighs on you. She said her parents and siblings loved her as their own and she loved them. But she also knew the extended family saw her as the adopted child, as the child that wasn't really theirs. She mentioned how both her birth parents rejected her when she reached out for contact. And how it all made her long for a genetic connection to the family she creates. She told Jane she can have that, it will just cost, but she could not in good conscience adopt when it would be her last choice. Jane called her names and told her she was disgusting and should be ashamed for viewing things this way.\n\nEver was so upset after talking to Jane. Then Jane called me a few days later and told me I should talk to Ever about how she needs to fix her thinking. I hated hearing my sister say that about my wife and I told Jane that she was the biggest hypocrite going because she only adopted her kids as a last resort after being told again and again that IUI and IVF would not work for her and that surrogacy wouldn't either. I told her we never judged her for how she started her family but I did judge her for having gone through all that and being so hard on Ever. I told her it was disgusting and she should be doing better.\n\nJane told me I had no business throwing her infertility in her face and she told me to go fuck myself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701711366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ape0k/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_a_hypocrite_to/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It can also be a very traumatic experience for multiple parties, including the child. Your wife is proof of that.", "NTA but i think the reason your sister is coming down on your wife so much is because if you and your wife have a bio kid she will be more angry and jealous that she couldn't do it. Your sister sounds like the type of person if she can't have it no one should be able to do it any other way but the way she did it. Basically your sister is mad you may have a chance at a bio kid while she never had a chance.", "NTA\n\nI'd stop talking to Jane for a long time.  She's incredibly disrespectful.

I can't believe even after Ever explained her reasoning to her, which she didn't need to do and was a very brave thing to do, your sister still didn't budge. You need to nip this in the bud so the aunt/niece relationship doesn't continue like this and make it clear this isn't up for discussion.", "NTA - For starters, look into the ethics of adoption - it's a horrific industry. That doesn't mean all adoptive parents are horrific, but the industry itself is. If, for any reason, you need to use donor eggs/sperm on your journey, I highly encourage you to look into the ethics of that, too. I regret using an anonymous donor for our donor conceived child now that I know more. She needs to stay in her lane. I wish you the best on your journey!", "NTA. Your sister sounds jealous.", "NTA, and to protect her own mental health, Ever really needs to block Jane. You said that Jane adopted as a last resort, it is possible that if you and Ever are successful with IVF (which can be a long tedious journey) and have biological children, Jane is probably afraid that her adopted children will be treated as less than by the family, although she probably will never be able to hide the extreme jealously of Ever and yourself having biological children when she couldn't.

Should the IVF be successful, sounds like she\u2019ll be even worse to your wife once you\u2019re expecting.", "NTA\u2026Jane has some nerve judging Ever when she dealt with infertility herself.

Is it possible your sister is jealous because you could have biological kids via IVF, and she couldn't?", "NTA and please protect your wife from Jane. Jane is clearly taking her own insecurities out on other people. \n\nI'm an adult adoptee and NOBODY should adopt unless they have the personal desire to do so. There is nothing wrong with trying to have biological children. My adoptive parents are fantastic, they raised me with love and I'm so grateful to them. But adoption is not easy! Adopting babies is hard, expensive, often falls through, and as you said, is often unethical. I chose to have my own biological children and was fortunate to be able to do that. \n\nPlus, obviously you know this, but adopting older children means those children often need serious care and support that not everyone is equipped to give, especially new parents. I'm parenting two biological children, and it's been a huge learning curve. There really is something a biological bond makes easier--I can sometimes understand them easier because they have some similar traits to me and my husband. I think I'm now emotionally equipped to foster or adopt a child with difficult needs, but I would not have been as a new parent at 24. For awhile, I had this dream of adopting older children who desperately needed homes. I'm so glad I didn't do that in my early 20s--it would have been terrible for them, I was not capable of parenting children with complex needs at that time in my life and with no experience with children. (Some people are! No shame to younger parents. I just personally was not there yet.) There are a lot of very valid reasons to choose fertility treatments over adoption and nobody should judge others for that. \n\nI wonder if some of Jane's attitude is misplaced jealousy or anger because you might be able to have what she couldn't, which is a biological child? I don't know her situation or what her adoption experience was, but it might have been difficult, because it often is. That doesn't mean everyone needs to go through those same difficulties, though. People need to do what's best for their families.", "NTA, Jane is. I'd go LC or NC with her", "NTA ~ \u201cfix her thinking\u201d your sister is awful and frankly, cruel, maybe she should be fixing her own thinking.  Good luck to you and your wife.", "NTA. As an adoptee, your wife is the most well-versed on the impact of adoption. It is trauma. \n\nAnd your sister needs to stay in her lane. Thank you for telling her that. \nYour presence in her life is a gift. You and your wife are not obligated.", "Nta. Jane is projecting. You guys having ivf is a stark reminder that she couldnt and she had to adopt ( seriously, if she thinks this about adopting, she should not). As for the adopting part, Ever is oh so right. My baby brother is adopted ( lol hes not a baby he's 14). I had to go no contact with my entire extended family for him. Treated me like they would treat any other person and treated him like shit.

I mean, no Christmas or other holiday gatherings, no caving to your parents who just want a big family get together, no cousin playdates, zero contact. Jane will poison your children\u2019s psyches if she ever has a chance. Jane no longer exists for your family. NTA, if you protect your wife from your hypocritical sister.", "NTA. Jane is only afraid you'all will get what she didn't manage to get.", "I have suggested this to her. She said she would do it but it needs a follow up.\n\nThat's something that frustrates me even more. Ever has more first hand experience than my sister. My sister can speak from the POV of someone who adopted her kids. Ever can speak from the POV of an adoptee and an adoptee who had a happier story than some but still had a complicated adoption at the same time.", "Yes, that's something Ever is very open about and conscious of.", "That's a thought I had too.", "Honestly this is something we have discussed more and more in the last week.", "I didn't think of that when I wrote it. I decided to use my wife's actual nickname but now I see it!", "I was super confused as I was reading through and the word ever kept being capitalized.

But I feel like we're at the point where going no contact is the only way forward.", "Thank you! My wife is so educated on donation too. Two of her friends donated and the stuff that came after is horrific. Hearing about it from them left me speechless. We actually decided for that reason that egg/sperm donation would not be for us.\n\nOnly after meeting my wife did I really even learn about the ethical issues with adoption. She knows a lot about it and she'll tell you she had one of the more ethical ones. But that doesn't mean everything as a whole about adoption is that ethical. It's sad.", "Bingo! Sister Jane has some very real issues with Ever potentially getting the one thing she couldn\u2019t get\u2026biological children. So now she is spitting her vile in anger and jealousy. Sounds like a perfect NC situation. Immediately!", "IVF is incredibly interesting and more and more kids are conceived from it. I nannied twin boys that were IVF, they\u2019re 9 now and love to tell people they were science babies lol. \n\nIt\u2019s much harder for kids that are adopted. They have a whole other family that plays a part in their identity. Of course things get complicated with donor IVF, but there is a big difference in I donated an egg versus I made you and grew you in my stomach, then selflessly gave you to another family. Doesn\u2019t make adoption any less, but you have to consider that it can be harder on the child. Your wife being adopted means that she recognizes those nuances. \n\nI\u2019m hoping IVF works out for you OP! Cut that sister out of your life, she\u2019s being unsupportive and you both don\u2019t need that.", "If they use donor eggs or sperm, the kids could have complicated feelings around that, especially if the donors are unknown or become problematic.  \n\nI think it's less likely than adoption though.", "Right?! Someone please explain what is unethical about it?! Jane is clearly bitter & hateful & seems like the misery loves company type that she doesn\u2019t wish for others to have success at fertility treatment as she didnt have any luck.

She didn't judge Jane for adopting and didn't even give her personal info on adoption until pushed by Jane, so Jane has no right to lash out at her. \n\nJane needs therapy but you and Ever should not stick around to continually be interrogated, judged and insulted by her.", "I get this as well. Anything she said has far more to do with herself than you and your wife. It's an incredibly heartless and dismissive position.  You and your wife have put a lot of thought into this from lived experience. NTA.", "Sorry but what the hell is wrong with Jane?! Is she always this insufferable & hateful about everyone?!\nSending you & Ever good luck for IVF!", "I'm really sorry to hear that. Maybe in time she'll realize what she's throwing away and reassess her attitude, but I agree you've got to protect Ever from this negativity - best of luck with the IVF.", "She's not. But with this (her fertility issues and how she became a mom) she can be insufferable at times.", "Thank you.
