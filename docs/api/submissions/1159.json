We've been planning this trip for over 6 months and it's the first vacation we've taken since our son was born 3 years ago.  I'm really looking forward to relaxing on a beach and sitting at a pool bar for a week.  \n\nMy MIL is going to be watching our son and our plan for months has been to have her come to our house for Thanksgiving and stay with us until our vacation.  This way she can get a good grasp of our son's routine and it will give them both a chance for us to talk to them about any questions because they might not be able to reach us 24/7 while we are away.  \n\nHowever, my wife's family has suddenly decided that they want to have a big family Thanksgiving.  My wife's uncle and his family decided to fly in from overseas for Thanksgiving this year.  They decided this within the last week.  This uncle has a lot of money and has made spur of the moment decisions like this in the past regarding holidays.  Because he lives overseas and doesn't get to see family often, the rest of the family always caters to his whims and makes last minute plans to get everyone together.\n\nThe host for Thanksgiving this year lives an 8-hour drive from us.  My wife and MIL want to go.  I absolutely do not.  I think that will be way too much driving and time away from our house so close to our vacation.  It's going to rush everything else we have to do before we leave.  Not to mention the added costs of driving that far and getting a hotel when we are already spending thousands on our vacation.  It won't break the bank for us, but it's a large unplanned expense that I don't want.    \n\nI told my wife that if she and MIL want to go, I will stay home with our son.  My wife said that she wants to bring our son so that he can play with his cousins.  I told her I will stay home by myself then to start preparing for our trip.  She told me I can't do that because she'll need my help with driving and with our son.  \n\nI told her this is her family and her uncle and it's not my fault they planned this all so late.  I told her we had plans we all agreed on, MIL included, and I don't want to pack in another huge trip so close to our vacation.  She said that she hasn't seen this uncle and his family since pre-pandemic and it's really important to her.  I reiterated that she and MIL can go and she can choose whether or not to bring our son, but I am going to be staying home.  \n\nShe thinks I am being unreasonable and inflexible and that if this was my family, I would be jumping through hoops to see them.  She says we can make everything work if we all work together.  She agrees that yes, it will make things harder, but it's not impossible especially if I pitch in and help.  \n\nI just think it's trying to pack too much in so close to our vacation and I would prefer to stick to our original plan.  If for nothing else than to keep our son comfortable before we leave him for a week.", "created_utc": 1667573148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym0x2o/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_wifes_family/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's an 8-hour drive away and I don't want to spend the money and time doing that so close to our vacation.

The other compromises sound more than reasonable.", "Your MIL and your wife both want to go. Isn\u2019t your MIL watching your child while you go on vacation? Thanksgiving is a week before your trip. You still have almost 3 weeks till Thanksgiving. I\u2019m pretty sure you can get loads done before then.", "NAH, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re frustrated with having some one try to change your plans suddenly and not wanting to chance ruining your vacation. \n\nIt\u2019s also understandable that your wife wants to see her family if they aren\u2019t around often. \n\nYou\u2019ve presented a reasonable alternative that would avoid disrupting your vacation plans. She would be TA if she insists you go to Thanksgiving.", "YTA.  Two- three days for Thanksgiving a week/week and a half before your vacation is not going throw off your trip. Plans change, of course you adjust for out of country family when possible.  You're digging your heels in on something that's totally doable. \n\nIf you do stay home (which I'll guarantee puts a mood on your vacation) while your wife goes, she should take your child.  It's a great chance for family to see him, visit etc.", "YTA do you really think it\u2019s a good time to piss off MIL right before she\u2019s supposed to watch your kid? You\u2019ve got free babycare, don\u2019t mess it up", "NTA\n\n> if this was my family, I would be jumping through hoops to see them\n\nBut would you be demanding *she* jump through those hoops for you?  Doesn\u2019t sound like it.  You\u2019ve given her plenty of options for making this work, which is more generous than a lot of people would have been over having their vacation plans disrupted for a guy who apparently does this kind of thing semi-regularly.  (And yes, the big vacation may still be a couple of weeks away, but this is still time off you hadn\u2019t planned to spend traveling.)  She needs to take the compromise and figure it out herself.", "So instead of helping your wife and your mil (who us going to babysit while you go on vacation) you want to make things harder for them because you don't want to? Like you admit it is possible and even more easy if you all work together but you don't want the disruption so you'd rather out more on your PARTNER? Yta for not even considering your spouse and mil and how your decision will effect them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
