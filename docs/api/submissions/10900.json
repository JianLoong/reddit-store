My SO recently developed a condition that results in them being unable to handle shock or adrenaline. I don't know the specifics. I'm in the hospital with them right now so I'm sorry if anything is missing. My in-laws are to put it mildly utterly evil. They don't present as such but they don't care about their children's wants and needs. My SO's brother moved to another country because MIL kept harassing him with foods that had peanuts in them (he's deathly allergic) and she finally put him in the hospital. They've sunk a lot of money into trying to find him since then, and she whines about how he should have just eaten the brittle instead of acting dramatic. That's how they are. My SO and I have moved clear across the country to get away from them after FIL ruined my car \"trying to change the oil.\" He put Windex in the oil tank and oil in the windshield fluid tank. This was done without my knowledge. A while ago, the in-laws showed up for my SO's birthday and broke into our house, setting up a surprise birthday party. My SO had a heart attack when we opened the door and I'm currently at their bedside. I've contacted a lawyer and my in-laws are in jail right now for the B&E. I'm going to be suing them and getting a restraining order. Is suing them going too far, morally speaking, or should we just move out of the country? AITA for suing them? I'm sorry if this is incoherent or doesn't make sense I've spent the past hour crying.\n\nEdit: a few people have wondered why I'm bothering with the idea of suing them. We have a decent amount of money, and they are running low. To be honest, if we win the suit, they won't have the money to continue chasing us or my SO's brother. As for the person who used a dead man to accuse me of faking this - screw you.", "created_utc": 1677359051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bvpa0/aita_for_suing_my_inlaws/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sue them (and drain the FUCK out of them for almost killing your partner), file for a protective order, do the whole 9. And THEN leave the country. I hope your partner will have a swift and comfortable recovery.", "Why don\u2019t you try a restraining order?", "NTA - They're evil.

Family or not, you don't have to maintain a relationship with abusive people. Treat them as you would a stranger who broke in and put your SO at significant mortal risk.", "NTA - and have investigation to see if they have any life insurance policies on your SO or BIL. If they are getting low on $$$ - it would be motive to see this kind of harm come to someone.", "Imo\u2026 Suing isn\u2019t a matter of morality here. It\u2019s a financial question. Is there enough money in your In-laws possession, to make a lawsuit worth it? If you can\u2019t reasonably win 50k or more, it\u2019s not worth it.

Something's missing. Anyway, It wouldn't be unreasonable to move away and go no contact with them for the sake and safety of you and your family.

If the trauma and mental health strain is too much, it may not be worth the loss of your SO's personal health.", "NTA. They sound awful and have no boundaries. They will likely be much easier to deal with if they are represented by a lawyer. Definitely get the restraining order at least.", "I'm surprised at the number of people who don't recommend suing. Assuming everything in the post is accurate, it sounds like the poster simply wants to keep them away. A lawsuit by itself will not accomplish that, but it can be excellent leverage. The vast majority of lawsuits are settled out of court, and in this case it sounds like the OP would settle for being left alone. The threat of monetary consequences might be enough to get their in laws to agree to the terms.", "NTA\nI think the restraining order is sufficient, though.\nWhat will suing them accomplish?\n\nHonestly, just from your side of the story, it seems like they are in need of some help from some sort of therapy.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo for it.", "No, you are NTA.  You aren't even close to being the AH.", "YTA!\n\nYou want to be done with these people but you want to sue them at the same time. You do realize this lawsuit is not going to cost just a butt load of money but it's going to cost time and energy. Suing them is just feeding into the insanity and it could last for several years before things are resolved.  Just move! Don't give these people your phone number or address. Have your mail go to a private mailbox and use that address for everything including your driver's license, contact info to other relatives, etc. \n\nI can imagine you're upset and you have the right to be upset.  Get your husband better. Let the crazy in-laws sit in jail and let that process play out. Do not continue going down the litigation route as there will be no real winners coming out of that situation.", "NTA they repeatedly disregarded and disrespect boundaries. It is time they understand their actions aren\u2019t appropriate", "What does your wife want?", "NTA - but I would speak to an attorney as I am not sure what you would sue them for. I think criminal charges would be better. I\u2019m no attorney so they would have a better idea. Also remember suing costs you money also especially if there is a chance you lose.
