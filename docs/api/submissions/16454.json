{"id": 16454, "submission_id": "138syh9", "title": "AITA For Lying About Having Cancer?", "selftext": "I know that seems like an intense title, let me explain. I (22F) recently shaved my head. I did it while on a trip to visit my partner (26M). He and his parents are a lot more accepting and free spirited than mine, and I\u2019ve been wanting my hair pixie cut length or shorter since I was 14, so I asked him to get the clippers before dinner and we buzzed it. He and his family said I looked cute and stylish and so much happier with my new cut, and I felt amazing. The problem is, a few days later my trip was over and I had to head back to my home state, which is in a conservative area of the US. I thought I was prepared to deal with negative comments, but apparently I wasn\u2019t as prepared as I thought.\n\nTwo days ago in the grocery store a woman (50s? F) approached me a few minutes after I walked in and asked me why I would cut my hair so short and if I was worried about looking like a boy. I told her that with how I\u2019m built (I\u2019m curvy and have a rather large chest), I\u2019m not too worried about being confused for a man, and if I am, I don\u2019t care. She started on this rant about how my parents should be \u201cashamed to let their daughter walk around like this\u201d and that it was sad to see someone who was \u201cprobably so beautiful and so feminine\u201d look like a \u201cfat little boy.\u201d I felt so angry and embarrassed and I wanted this an it feel how she was making me feel, so I said the first thing I could think of.\n\nI told her she should be ashamed for talking about someone recovering from chemo like that. I then told her I was diagnosed and treated for ovarian cancer and that I shaved my head after I started losing my hair and it\u2019s only recently started to grow back now that I\u2019m in recovery. She started backpedaling and trying to apologize, but I left her and my empty cart there and shrugged her off as she tried to follow me out the store. I ended up telling one of my roommates about the incident, but she thinks I\u2019m not an asshole because the lady started it. I still feel really bad though. Am I the AH here?\n\nEdit: I just want to make it clear that this was a pressured, spur of the moment response. I didn\u2019t and have never planned to lie to justify my haircut to people and regardless of the outcome here I don\u2019t ever want to do this again. I don\u2019t like lying. It makes me feel awful to lie, regardless of any proposed justification.", "created_utc": 1683302251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138syh9/aita_for_lying_about_having_cancer/", "score": 288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fuck her.", "I'm gonna choose to look at it this way: You lied to teach this woman a lesson for being a massive AH.

Never lie about having cancer. And also, you missed an opportunity to put that woman in her place using the truth, whichbis that it is absolutely none of her concern what you do with your hair and body and that if someone's look offends her because they don't conform with her puritanical gender norms she can fuck right off back to her barefoot and pregnant lifestyle.\n\nShe sucks for all the reasons I just listed above.", "YTA\n\nLying about something like this will make people less sympathetic and trusting of actual cancer victims.

You should have just stared at her like she had two heads and said \"what business is it of yours?\"  Or \"Ma'am, I have no idea why you're talking to me, but I hope your day goes better.\"", "ESH\n\nShe is obviously an asshole for going up and yelling at you.\n\n\nAnd I get its hard to stand up for yourself, but I just personally feel icky hearing someone lied about cancer, regardless of the reason.

Do anything else but lie about cancer and also dont do physical violence.", "ESH. The lady at the store is evidently a mean old redneck AH who should mind her own business, and you are an AH for using a disease like that as petty payback. Tons of people suffer through chemo and endure this day to day, or they know someone they love who does; it\u2019s just morally wrong to use that just to keep a bully quiet. \n\nMust be said though, she was the far bigger AH in this; you\u2019ll find a lot of people will mock you for making different choices, but you do need to find a more assertive way of facing that.", "ESH The lady deserved to be put in her place, but you could have done that without lying. It's kind of weird tbh", "YTA- I think you could have said something along the lines of this without lying about battling cancer. As someone who fought ovarian cancer and lost my hair, it was not a choice I made to lose my hair. Not only was chemo a physical battle but the mental battle of looking sick from unwanted baldness and medications was one of the lowest points of my life. \n\n\n1. You can\u2019t make everyone happy. And choosing to put weight to words from random people is  not worth it.\n2. People will say unwanted things, but fighting fire with fire is a choice. And bringing in someone else\u2019s  struggles to make them feel bad for commenting on you is poor imo. You could have defended yourself without pretending you have cancer to put them down. And you may have brought her association between shaved heads with being sick which is not what I think you were going for. \n\n\nThat being said, rocking a shaved head is really cool. Own your look!", "YTA.... it was your choice to shave your head .. most  cancer patients don't get that choice.     You've used their suffering and being out of control of their own body to defend your choices you made being in complete control of what happens to yours.", "ESH. Obviously this other woman sucks because why is anyone else\u2019s hair her business? She was incredibly nasty towards you and you didn\u2019t deserve that. \n\nHOWEVER, it was still wrong of you to lie about having a very serious condition to shame someone into silence. I can understand disliking confrontation and correcting people when they\u2019re being horrid, but if you can\u2019t think of a good and honest response, it\u2019s perfectly fine to just walk away from the situation. There\u2019s no need to lie, or even dignify them with a response. \n\nBut, if you\u2019re worried this might be a regular occurrence, don\u2019t be afraid to stand your ground. Be proud of your cut! It\u2019s beautiful! Don\u2019t rely on the stereotype of bald = chemo. It not only perpetuates the idea that women being bald isn\u2019t a choice and is due to ill health, but can also make it difficult for those who don\u2019t experience hair loss during treatment to be believed when they say \u201cI\u2019m going through chemo\u201d.", "Mild YTA, and stop caring what random women (or anyone really) think about what makes you happy.", "YTA.\n\nYou gave into your worst instincts to grab social power by lying about your situation.

If you had it to do over again, I would like to think that you wouldn\u2019t actually tell this old biddy you had cancer.\n\nWhen my husband was alive, he would get judgements based on his appearance too.
