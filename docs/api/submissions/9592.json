Isn't good for kids.  Even though sometimes it is true, it makes it even worse on the kid being bullied because then they feel like they would be in the wrong to say anything back, or might feel guilty for reporting them.", "NTA. Probably not the best thing to tell your child but I fully understand why you did it. Sounds like this has been going on for some time and took a while for the school to actually do something about it. The fact they have to keep them apart speaks volumes. You're frustrated by the situation and the literal \u013aove of your life is being bullied, relentlessly by the sounds of it.", "ESH\n\nYou for having the emotional regulation skills of a toddler while being old enough to have supposedly learned them, \n\nMegan for bullying your daughter, \n\nAlexa for assuming the worst of her sister, \n\nand Tina\u2014actually, Tina is the one person who doesn't suck in this situation but is having the suckiest time. \n\nMaybe think about what's best for her, most effective, and what will teach her how to set appropriate boundaries while helping her to self-validate so that Megan's words have little effect? \n\nThat would benefit everybody and demonstrate the adult behavior you'd want from a parent.", "Edit: Instead of downvoting, can I get a reason why my comment is also arseholish? \n\nSomeone mentioned about confronting the bully and I certainly don't mean to victimise them. \n\nI would rather learn other points of view than just be down voted. Thank you. \n\n\n\nYTA - You are taking the piss out of a 13 year old girl that you admit probably bullies because of insecurities about herself. \n\nFrom what you said, not that I am excusing bullying at all, it sounds like Megan might be dealing with a lot of shit at home. \n\n2 options in my opinion: \n\n1 - leave it and apologise for speaking like that about a child to your daughter. Tell her you lashed out at Megan in anger, but explain that you think she does it due to insecurities. \n\n2 - See if you can get Megan and your daughter to go out and talk about it. Like you say, it's probably due to insecurities, so perhaps Megan is jealous of your daughters looks? What if your daughter invited Megan to go to the park and chat for an hour or something; where you could be near and keep an eye on them. \n\nYou are the arsehole 100% for taking the piss out of a child's looks and using that to make your daughter feel better, while also knowing that who you're talking about is 13 and most likely insecure! \n\nI know you want to protect your daughter but your 20 year old is right. What example does that set? \n\nEncourage empathy. Even if Megan is still trying to bully her; at least your daughter will know its because she is feeling shit about herself, and that it's someone lashing out rather than her comments being true. \n\nBasically, you're an adult.

Not because the bulky deserves it as others have suggested, because I don't think any child deserves to have their appearance criticized like that (and Megan *is* a child) but because giving some rationale/logical framework to your daughter is the kind and helpful thing to do. \n\nI doubt your daughter is ever going to seek Megan out to say something hurtful like \"my mom says you're not pretty and that's why you're a bully\" because A: the bullied don't usually seek out the bullies and B: that's a lame insult lol. But being able to have a thought like that in her head like \"she's being terrible to me because she feels bad about herself, I shouldn't take it to heart\" is a relatively healthy way to cope with Megan's treatment. \n\nI was horribly bullied by a few boys in my class when I was in elementary school, and I distinctly remember my grandma telling me something like \"the meaner they are, the more they like you, because boys don't know how to show it\" - and while that wasn't really a healthy mindset for future relationships, it did help me rationalize that it's not my fault they are being mean, it's because they don't know how to handle their own feelings.\n\nEdit: typo", "So, no one said this to Tina?

As a mom trying to comfort and defend her cub, I get it. You wanted to help her through it and your instinct was to pounce! Your older daughter does have a point. Rather than coming up with a legitimate solution or providing other ways to cope with that kind of negativity you resorted to name calling and making fun of someone's appearance.

If it was just a bully who didn't give a shit, I wouldn't have suggested it. Context clues here say to me that kid is lashing out and looking for anyone to give a shit about her. \n\nRemember; 13 years old with insecurities (so says OP so if she can see it, who am I to argue?) \n\nThink about what makes a bully. As I said initially, I don't condone bullying at all, although I do condone being honest and learning how to not knee-jerk react and think logically about it. \n\nBefore you chastise me; I was bullied for years as a kid. Ended up being friends with most of them. Just takes perspective, although I am not saying you're wrong. Just giving more context for my opinion.", "OK, I just don't understand why that was relevant. You're 55+ laughing at a 13 year old? Kinda weird.", ">It teaches her daughter that when people are in shitty situations headspaces/ that they take it out on others to make themselves feel less miserable\n\nAnd it also teaches her that she has to put up with them, because they have a bad life. \n\n It teaches her that is okay to put up with abuse because the abuser is probably sad, so she has to let them abuse her to make them feel better. \n\n It teaches her that she can't stand up to their abusers, because then she would be at fault, since poor bullies do it because their mommy didn't read them a night story. \n\n The only way to stop bullying is to stand up to them. And if that means telling her she is ugly and to shut the f up, then she should do that. Megan can hate herself all she wants, as long as she does it somewhere else. Having a bad life doesn't mean others have to put up with your abuse, or that if a person defends herself she is the bad one. \n\nSo gtfoh with that self righteous bs. People like you are the reason others put up with being abused. Because apparently if they defend themselves, they are the bad ones, cause god forbids they talk back to their bully. What a load of crap", "That isn't what I meant nor is it how my daughter took it. We have spoken about the fact that no one has the right to tear anyone down based on looks."]}
