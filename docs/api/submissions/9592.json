Tell her you lashed out at Megan in anger, but explain that you think she does it due to insecurities. \n\n2 - See if you can get Megan and your daughter to go out and talk about it.

Just ask all the creeps on the internet that use that as an excuse to creep on literal children.\n\nBut even if the daughter is a bit overweight that is no reason to bully her and there is a good chance that she will outgrow that", "Yeah, that\u2019s why I said \u201cmost 13 year olds\u201d , not all.\n\nAnd I agreed in my first comment, that regardless of if she is fat or not, bullying is not OK", "I think your older daughter has a point.\n\nI was bullied growing up. I get it. It\u2019s rough.\n\nI think it\u2019s totally fair to say that Megan may have some of her own insecurities and this could explain her behavior. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to make comments about other people\u2019s looks, especially children.\n\nI distinctly remember my mother calling a girl who was mean to me ugly. I remember it kind of made me feel better but it also felt weird. What if this girl was someone I was friends with? What if she was nice? Funny enough, I\u2019m friends with this girl now despite the fact she bullied me almost 15 years ago. And I still remember what my mother said.\n\nMean girls suck. I\u2019m a teacher and I see and deal with them all of the time. But calling each other ugly doesn\u2019t do anything. It just causes more hurt. It\u2019s also unfair because our looks are not representative of who we are as people. We teach our kids to be kind to one another. We teach them that name-calling and judging other\u2019s appearance is wrong- but suddenly it\u2019s okay because the other person is being unkind? \n\nMy mother making fun of the girls who were mean to me by calling them fat and ugly actually hurt my self-esteem more because I became obsessed with not looking \u201cugly\u201d like those girls. When I gained weight as a teenager, I thought of the girls my mom called fat. I didn\u2019t worry about not being mean like they were\u2014I feared being seen as ugly in the eyes of my own mother. \n\nYoung girls are so impressionable and the shit that\u2019s said to us stays with us forever. I know I am not the only one\u2014my friends also had moms who made comments like the ones my mom did. They had good intentions, but it really only ended up hurting us in the long term. \n\nWhat if Tina and Megan end up becoming friends one day? She\u2019ll remember what you said about Megan.\n\nPlease teach young girls to judge each other\u2019s character and not looks. While she may never say these things, they will be in her head and will affect her view of how girls should look.", "ESH\n\nI think what matters is the lesson learned here. \u201cShe\u2019s not very pretty either\u201d teaches your daughter that her self esteem needs to come from comparing herself to others (and winning in the comparison).\n\nWhat happens when some AH in the future makes fun of a mistake she makes at work/school and she realizes she actually does need to improve? Or when someone makes fun of her appearance and that person is actually attractive?\n\nWhen your confidence comes from believing you are better than others, the first time you realize their comments might have some accuracy, you have no idea how to handle it. No one should be making your daughter feel like shit, they are AHs. But she needs to learn that her confidence comes from herself. \n\nIf someone calls her dumb, she needs to know that she has endless potential to learn and improve and if someone calls her ugly, she needs to know that it\u2019s just one person\u2019s opinion, 95% of the population is \u201caverage\u201d and that as long as she feels healthy and beautiful that\u2019s all that matters.", "YTA you are an adult bullying a child. You are no better than her and you have provided your child a glowing example of stooping down to her bullys level. You have reinforced the bullying your daughter got because you demonstrated that its ok to talk unkindly about how a child looks if you don't like them or they have done something that you don't like.", "People like drew afualo helped me realized it\u2019s ok to fight fire with fire. You wanna throw stones in glass houses? Fine. But you\u2019re gonna have to deal with the consequences. As for your older daughter just explain you\u2019re not expecting Tina to use malicious tactics to make herself feel better. (Ex:Bring other women down to lift yourself up) Rather you\u2019re trying to make sure both your kids have got nice shiny spines. Regardless if Megan was a Micheale I bet you\u2019d still say the same thing. That one there is a difference between speaking up for yourself and  picking a fight. And two that it\u2019s not important what others think, but what TINA thinks. And it\u2019s that she\u2019s kind, smart and loves herself. You\u2019re doing a good job Op NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell Tina that Megan has probably already peaked in high school while she's gonna grow into a healthy individual who I'm sure will be way more compassionate and understanding of individuals.\n\nShe has every right to defend herself in this case given her history and you should tell your other daughter to back Tina up.", "NTA OP \n\nI wish my parents had given a damn about me being picked on when I was younger . Both my siblings and a few people at school would poke fun at me , but I was supposed to just get \"over \" it . (Spoiler , I did not and it's made me very self conscious about my weight ) \n\nI've also had some people of color make fun of how white I am , I am very , very fair skin , and it's very obvious when someone is loudly talking about me because they're standing in a group and pointing at me . \n\nI'm in my thirties and that shit stings still \n\nThe sister can go kick rocks , because she's either never been bullied or she is one.", "NTA - bullies deserve whatever they have come at them. \u201cWords will never hurt me\u201d right?", "NTA\n\nWhat is it with people who should defend family but instead have compassion for a bully?\n\nWhy isnt Alexa more supportive of Tina?\n\nSo many young girls take this criticism so deep, and it has lasting effects, even suicide.\n\nAll the measures you went through just so your daughter can be left alone, but Megan first opportunity again around Tina and she goes in.\n\nYou're way better than me because I absolutely would verbally check a kid who was making my childs life miserable.  Or arm her with exactly what to say to shut it all the way down.\n\n  I don't give allowances for \"reasons\" why you are a bully. Bullies who go uncheck turn into adults who usually need severe reality checks.\n\nYou said something observantly true. Megan is probably no head turner and is most likely jealous of your daughter.\n\nTell Alexa to take several seats!", "NTA. Your remark was pretty mild, overall. It sounds like basically you're all decent people who don't resort to verbal abuse for fun. Caution Tina to refrain from repeating what you said to Megan, for the simple reason that bullied kids tend to get in trouble for retaliating and that would make her feel even worse. What you told Tina is true.", "Agree that it can create a harmful framework for Tina - it\u2019s messaging like this that can create feelings of being valued only for your looks or not feeling pretty enough, especially for young girls.  Megan sucks because she\u2019s mean, not because she\u2019s not conventionally attractive.", ">Sure, there are people who are just \"bigger\", but not considered overweight or unhealthy. The danger is with people who are seriously obese that refuse to acknowledge current or potential health problems due to their weight. It is absolutely not fat shaming to point out those risks.\n\nliterally not your business unwanted medical advice is obnoxious. you do not pay for their medical so stfu and stay in your place"]}
