I come from a loud family. We yelled for arguments big and small, we yelled for excitement and discussions, we yelled to ask what you wanted for dinner because someone didn\u2019t want to climb the stairs. We all generally speak loudly and even more so when excited. A previous partner came from a quiet family and any raised voice at all meant someone was going to get beat. Obviously I had to learn to tone it down and I think that was totally appropriate. I learning not yell during arguments! But it was frustrating to be accused of yelling when I was definitely only speaking a bit on the loud side, or wasn\u2019t even being loud I was just unhappy. Any negativity at all was \u201cyelling\u201d to the point where I felt like I wasn\u2019t allowed to feel my feelings. And my partner refused to get therapy to deal with their warped perception of things even though I had worked hard to communicate in a better way for them. \n\nPoint is, she needs to understand and respect the fact that she is venting her feelings in a harmful way. And if she won\u2019t work on it or find another way to get those feelings out that\u2019s not harmful to you (or if she amps it up when you complain) that\u2019s abusive.  But also you need to do some work to make sure you\u2019re not requiring others to walk on eggshells around you due to your trauma. Talk to a therapist and make sure your perception matches what\u2019s happening and that you\u2019re not projecting past experiences on current partners.", "You are NTA. Although I don\u2019t think your solution will work. She is bonding/venting with you. \n\nI can get very wound up when I am upset (venting) about something. I gesticulate, I get loud.

Lol \n\nMy ex would get frustrated with me because he\u2019d been in a past relationship with a yeller. \n\nHe would tell me to calm down. He\u2019d leave the conversation. It made me feel like I had to walk on eggshells around him. As if I couldn\u2019t be myself. It drove me crazy. I mean, I wasn\u2019t angry with him.

I can see why you thought this was a compromise.", "NTA", "NTA, assuming you've talked with her about it when she's calmed down (\"I've asked her to please stop or do it quietly\" isn't super clear on what exactly you said and what the extent of the conversation was). If that's the case, though, you should probably leave - she's not respecting your mental health.\n\nIf you *haven't* talked to her, I'd suggest telling her *why* her yelling is a problem. You can keep it vague if you want (\"it really upsets me, it feels like you're yelling at me instead of around me\") or you can tell her that you come from an abusive household.\n\nI will say it was kinda passive-aggressive buying her the bear, especially if you haven't had an actual conversation with her about it, but not enough for me to call you an AH given what's going on.\n\nAgain, if you have had a genuine conversation with her about it, you need to leave for your own sake. Whether that means moving out until you can go to couples therapy or breaking up with her is up to you.", "NTA. Yelling is triggering for me and the rest of my siblings, and TBH it's not really an appropriate way to vent frustration regardless. Partners who care about you will understand your triggers and try to accommodate you. Your girlfriend doesn't even seem to be trying. Does she actually care about you? Think about how you want to be treated in a relationship, and act accordingly.", "ESH \n\nI hate to say it but I don\u2019t think you two should live together. Her yelling is not at all appropriate and I can understand that it is triggering to you.", "Yeah, I think YTA even if you have a legitimate complaint. You need to use your words and have an adult conversation about how she makes you feel. Not try to manage her feelings with a stuffed animal like she is five years old.", "Esh. Kinda comes across like a dick move to give her teddy bear like she's a child. \n\nHowever.... she's 36. She should have some more control over her emotions. I'd think if she's coming home from work every day this upset, she needs to find a new job. Or go to therapy to figure out what the issue is. \n\nIt's awesome she trusts you enough to want to come and vent to you about her issues, but when she's doing in a way that is making you feel like a punching bag or if your to the point your not looking forward to seeing her because of this, something obviously needs to be fixed.", "YTA. You do not get to tell other adults how to deal with their emotions. You can enforce boundaries that you will not engage with her when she's yelling.

You\u2019re incompatible because she feels she needs to yell when she vents and you get triggered by the yelling.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like you are at your wits end here.

I would have walked away, started scrolling on your phone, whatever until she calmed down then give her the stuffed animal.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you having the stuffed animal as a security blanket until you guys decide how you want to proceed with the relationship.  No one deserves to receive this or any other type of abuse.", "NTA. You are trying to find a way for her to vent her initial frustration without triggering your trauma.

Don't blame others assumptions on OP just because their statement of \"I've asked her to please stop or do it quietly, but she says it's just venting and perfectly normal.\" wasn't uber detailed and descriptive enough to fit the assumers standards. (idk if assumers is a word but I like it so it stays.)\n\nMy questions haven't been answered yet, but they don't need to be for my vote. How nice of you to assume that I made my decision based on an assumption... The irony... I based my vote on OP's replies to others stating that they have talked about the situation multiple times and asked in different ways, not on assumptions of what the answers would be. Regardless of whether or not the root cause of the trauma was discussed, if your SO asks you to stop yelling around/at them multiple times, then you need to talk to them and figure out what's going on.", "Yes, you actually can do both of these things. If she then turns her yelling to be directed specifically towards and about you after you have either asked her to stop or walked away, then she is clearly telling you she does NOT respect you and care about your comfort and feelings.

All these people acting like she should just be allowed to yell and scream whenever she's upset and trigger him. I absolutely cannot handle yelling particularly from romantic partners because of trauma from an abusive relationship where I was constantly yelled at over nothing. My current partner understands and is great about it, but when she's occasionally been frustrated about something and yelled (even when it's not directed at me) I have an awful panic response. Years of therapy have helped me build coping skills and figure out how to push through that response and self-soothe, but it still sucks, and some days you're just more worn down and stretched thin than others and you can't calm yourself down so easily. My abusive relationship was a small period of time compared to OPs ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, and those scars run deep. He deserves to be with someone who isn't constantly triggering him.\n\nThere's definitely a gender bias here too, even though few will admit it. I'm a transgender woman, and my abuser was a cis women who I dated before I transitioned. When people thought I was a guy being yelled at by his girlfriend, they didn't see me as abused, they saw me as whipped. No one took the idea of a guy being emotionally or verbally abused by his girlfriend seriously. Now it's been years since I transitioned, but people are far more understanding and willing to see me as a survivor of domestic abuse now that I'm out as a woman.", "Not the same scenario at all.  \n\nI didn't make a judgement and explained why.

No way to judge.", "No.  It's not okay for anyone to fail to consider someone's issues but we have no diagnosis for OP, we don't know why she says she's not yelling and he says she is - there simply put are zero specifics in this post.", "Then you aren't compatible. You asked for what you needed, she can't or won't do it. I can see why you tried the teddy bear thing, but the reality is she's a grown up and she doesn't agree with you - you can't \"fix\" that by assigning her a rage bear, and I'm not surprised she's pissed about it. It's condescending.\n\nIt's hard to say from the post if either of you are \"wrong\" - venting is reasonable, not wanting to listen to loud voices is reasonable. Maybe one of you is out of line, but it's more likely that you guys just aren't a good fit for each other.\n\nI think you gotta kindly but firmly end this. It's sad when a relationship ends, but if you two can't resolve this I don't see how either of you could live with it.", "In his comments he describes that if he tries to walk away from her she follows him and turns to shouting at him.\n\nThat is ridiculous behaviour.  It is abusive and it is wrong, and the guy needs to finally find himself a safe and quiet place in the world where he can rest and develop himself peacefully.", "I must admit I am sensitive because I had a female stalker for two years and then a jealous, abusive wife.  But, what I really feel here is that sense of having no rational way of dealing with it.\n\nWhat sent me over the edge is OP saying in a comment that if he walks away, she follows him and then turns on him.  He is in an awful situation, and to see people here going all softball on an abuser just because of her gender disgusts me.  \n\nI hope you are well, by the way.

Walking away just delays the fight until whenever you come back, because once you return it's a brand new fight about why you walked away. Until you're able to leave for good, the yelling lasts until they get tired of yelling, and all you can do is endure it. Makes you feel helpless and trapped and awful.\n\nI'm glad you are out and recovering. Its been about seven years since I got out, but it took me years after it was over to admit to myself that I was abused and start therapy to work through it.

Also working on this problem doesn't mean you unilaterally decide she has to yell at a teddy bear now, you need to get her in the boat first", "Taking a complicated stance here that you\u2019re NTA and maybe she isn\u2019t either. \n\nFirst - you\u2019re doing great recognizing and vocalizing how your past abusive home environment has impacted you and still impacts you. This self awareness, and willingness to approach the issue directly with yourself, and your girlfriend, is telling that you\u2019re coming at the issue from a foundation of problem solving for the sake of seeking wellbeing. This is the basis for health and recovery. \n\nSecond - you\u2019re now sharing a home with your girlfriend, which means you and she both have to a) feel safe there to cope with your own lives and stressors, and b) compromise around allowing your significant other to feel safe there to cope with their own lives and stressors. \n\nIt sounds like your background is a lot of scenarios in which other people\u2019s direct expressions of their own negative emotions created a dynamic that was unsafe, harmful, abusive, and hurtful, so your nervous system now naturally responds other people\u2019s direct expressions of negative emotions with a triggered response. \n\nSince I don\u2019t know every detail in this situation, I can\u2019t say whether your girlfriend is an emotional an rollercoaster or whether she is merely a direct person experiencing real stressors and blowing off steam at home where she feels safe to do so. If it\u2019s the latter, it MIGHT be the case that your girlfriend, while triggering your nervous system into a very real stress response, is someone who can help you develop greater tolerance and impartiality to other people\u2019s direct expression of negative emotions. \n\nAgain, if it\u2019s the latter, that she is experiencing real stressors and venting at home where she feels safe to do so, there has to be a degree to which she is free to cope in this way on occasion. You aren\u2019t wrong to want to offer other coping mechanisms as an option while you reframe how you view direct expression of negative emotions and recondition your nervous system to build tolerance , but offering a grown woman who might be having normal reactions to stress a teddy bear could definitely be infantilizing and an indication that you are passing the buck of your own recovery process back to her when you could be approaching the situation with the intent to reframe your beliefs about others\u2019 expressions of negative emotions, while reconditioning your body to have less of a nervous system response over time, which would bring you more general comfort and allow you to live in recovery from your trauma triggers. \n\nIt all hinges on this: to what degree might your girlfriend be having reasonable reactions, and to what degree are you willing to learn how to hold space for her to blow off steam, and then to what degree is she willing to validate the impact this has on your body\u2019s stress response, and to what degree will you each participate as equals in selecting a protocol for creating a home environment in which you can both, over time and work, feel safe sharing a home where expression of negative emotions is tolerable without another person having to soak it up like a sponge? \n\nI suggest hearing her that the teddy bear made her feel infantilized. I would explain you made an insensitive attempt to address what is an issue for you without first directly seeking her participation in problem solving. Couple problem solving has to be a calm, clearly articulated and defined talk sessions where there are no distractions and nobody is presently triggered. \n\nTl;dr: If she is a generally healthy person, and her direct expressions of negative emotions are triggering you, your triggers are valid, and you cannot expect your partner to totally negotiate her healthy ability to blow of steam because it happens to trigger you into a stress response. If she is having healthy expressions of negative emotions at home, where she feels safe to do so, and your response is to buy a grown woman a teddy bear, you are potentially leaning into your own fragility in being triggered to invalidate your girlfriend\u2019s real adult stressors and creating a home where it is not safe for her to vent in a way that might not be abusive, that you might grow to tolerate more if you and she approach the issue as a team looking to problem solve into having a home where you are both safe to be yourselves.", "NTA.

By the time one is in their 20s or 30s, it's time to stop yelling, throwing tantrums, and \"venting.\"", "> You do not get to tell other adults how to deal with their emotions.\n\nYeah who cares if your boyfriend breaks things and hits the walls when he's mad as long as it's not directed toward you? Oh wait, wrong post.", "So he's an asshole for desperately trying to refocus her abusive behavior onto something else?", "She's what people politely term: \"emotionally immature\", so the teddy was perfect. \n\nOP, you see that it's not acceptable that she uses you as an emotional punching bag. The solution is to ditch her.", ">Why did you read straight past the part in the post where OP detailed trying to talk it out? \n\nWe already know the answer. The alternative is calling a woman an asshole.", "Abusive? She calls it venting and he states he has a problem with yelling, also never says she yells at him. I'd say she likes to express her frustration in a way he is uncomfortable with, that not abuse. So they should work on it together or he works on himself but not just tell her what to do", "Yeah, it happens like clockwork every time a man is the victim of abuse. It's really eye-opening when you see how often abuse by women is excused and justified. That said, this thread seems better than most.", "Abuse? How is venting/yelling that isn\u2019t directed at your partner abuse. The state of this sub jfc lol.", "I have to do the same with mine haha he just doesn\u2019t realise how loud he is, and when he\u2019s talking passionately it can come across as ranty so I have to let him know to chill, and he does as soon as I do. This is the way.", "If this was a guy who was punching the walls because he had a bad day at work and his girlfriend was saying it scared her and upset her, there would be zero grey area. People would be flooding out to tell her to leave his ass before he hit her.", "\u201cMy SO asked me to stop yelling so I started yelling at him\u201d\n\nBrilliant. Totally not a red flag. Great job, really.\n\n/s", ">In this case, because OP made it sound like she agreed to try and do better but hasn't been able to.\n\n\"Babe I'm trying not to punch the wall when I'm mad why are you leaving? Why wouldn't we try therapy first?\"\n\n>If she'd been unrepentant\n\nSo her lovebombing and making empty promises is okay?", "At most ( I repeat  AT MOST) you are a confused soul, but AH, nah I don't think so.", "NTA but I think you need to rethink this relationship, my friend. You've talked to her about it and she's not changing her behaviour. At the very kindest reading of this situaiton, you're incompatible because your communication styles and needs are incompatible. However, the fact she follows you and continues to shout at you as if it's your fault she was angry in the first place or making it worse, means the worst reading feels more accurate. This is emotional abuse and you shoudln't have to live this way. \n\nYou tried something, and it didn't work, but it's unfortunately not on you for her changing how she acts when she's frustrated, that has to come from her and she doesn't seem to care that her \"venting\" is harmful to you. You deserve better. Think of what the rest of your life will be like if you stay with her, then really consider if that's the future you want. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your gf is abusive, lots of red flags here. The fact that she's more worried about your solution treating her as childish, than the fact that you resorted to it due to her terrible behaviour towards you is concerning. Does she care at all about the impact she's having on you? You aren't a punchbag, physically or verbally. Don't let her treat you like one.", "Honestly OP I see no reason to continue this relationship. NTA", "NTA. The bear is a tool. She could use it. She could work on her anger issues.  I\u2019d suggest anger management since she so rudely rejected your gift meant to help her manage her anger. \n\nI used teddy bears deep into my 20s. When I would get upset or overwhelmed my then bf would grab my bear, we even travelled with it, and would give it to me and then hold me until I was better. He was damn near 40 and never once did he judge me or think it childish for me to use. It\u2019s a literal coping tool. \n\nShe can desire different coping tools but she was wrong to shame your solution.", "NTA\n\n> she says it's just venting and perfectly normal.\n\nThere are very few circumstances where yelling is warranted or appropriate - and particularly with venting, yelling will sound angry.\n\nBut even venting isn\u2019t healthy - it actually makes people angrier.\n\n> She got pissed with me and told me I'm treating her like a \"fucking child\" even though I just don't want to be yelled at for no reason.\n\nI think her reaction here wasn\u2019t unpredictable, but I understand what you were trying to do.\n\nSo you have a decision to make.\n\nDo you want to stay with someone who yells at you, who takes their anger out on you, and refuses to change?\n\nYour partner has currently decided it\u2019s acceptable to scare and upset you to suit their own emotional wants and habits. (Venting is not a need. We are not hydraulic presses.)", "NTA, she's abusive, dump her.", "NTA.  Next time she yells, get up and leave the room.  Separating yourself from her yelling will start to drive home the fact that it isn't acceptable behavior.  If this happens when you are out, get up and leave.

You would absolutely not say the same if a guy was just punching the wall because it's just 'how he vents', after all it's not like the violence is directed at her or anything.\n\n>but not just tell her what to do\n\nThis is absolutely the strangest way to word 'set boundaries' I've ever seen. He's saying he is uncomfortable and scared when she yells, but him not wanting that around him is somehow him 'telling her what to do'? The bias is insanely strong with this one.", "It's absolutely directed at him. According to OPs own comments, if he tries to leave in order to get away from the yelling, she follows him and yells at him more."]}
