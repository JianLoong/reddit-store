I come from a loud family. We yelled for arguments big and small, we yelled for excitement and discussions, we yelled to ask what you wanted for dinner because someone didn\u2019t want to climb the stairs. We all generally speak loudly and even more so when excited. A previous partner came from a quiet family and any raised voice at all meant someone was going to get beat. Obviously I had to learn to tone it down and I think that was totally appropriate. I learning not yell during arguments! But it was frustrating to be accused of yelling when I was definitely only speaking a bit on the loud side, or wasn\u2019t even being loud I was just unhappy. Any negativity at all was \u201cyelling\u201d to the point where I felt like I wasn\u2019t allowed to feel my feelings. And my partner refused to get therapy to deal with their warped perception of things even though I had worked hard to communicate in a better way for them. \n\nPoint is, she needs to understand and respect the fact that she is venting her feelings in a harmful way. And if she won\u2019t work on it or find another way to get those feelings out that\u2019s not harmful to you (or if she amps it up when you complain) that\u2019s abusive.  But also you need to do some work to make sure you\u2019re not requiring others to walk on eggshells around you due to your trauma. Talk to a therapist and make sure your perception matches what\u2019s happening and that you\u2019re not projecting past experiences on current partners.", "You are NTA. Although I don\u2019t think your solution will work. She is bonding/venting with you. \n\nI can get very wound up when I am upset (venting) about something. I gesticulate, I get loud.

Lol \n\nMy ex would get frustrated with me because he\u2019d been in a past relationship with a yeller. \n\nHe would tell me to calm down. He\u2019d leave the conversation. It made me feel like I had to walk on eggshells around him. As if I couldn\u2019t be myself. It drove me crazy. I mean, I wasn\u2019t angry with him.

I can see why you thought this was a compromise.", "NTA", "NTA, assuming you've talked with her about it when she's calmed down (\"I've asked her to please stop or do it quietly\" isn't super clear on what exactly you said and what the extent of the conversation was). If that's the case, though, you should probably leave - she's not respecting your mental health.\n\nIf you *haven't* talked to her, I'd suggest telling her *why* her yelling is a problem. You can keep it vague if you want (\"it really upsets me, it feels like you're yelling at me instead of around me\") or you can tell her that you come from an abusive household.\n\nI will say it was kinda passive-aggressive buying her the bear, especially if you haven't had an actual conversation with her about it, but not enough for me to call you an AH given what's going on.\n\nAgain, if you have had a genuine conversation with her about it, you need to leave for your own sake. Whether that means moving out until you can go to couples therapy or breaking up with her is up to you.", "NTA. Yelling is triggering for me and the rest of my siblings, and TBH it's not really an appropriate way to vent frustration regardless. Partners who care about you will understand your triggers and try to accommodate you. Your girlfriend doesn't even seem to be trying. Does she actually care about you? Think about how you want to be treated in a relationship, and act accordingly.", "ESH \n\nI hate to say it but I don\u2019t think you two should live together. Her yelling is not at all appropriate and I can understand that it is triggering to you.", "Yeah, I think YTA even if you have a legitimate complaint. You need to use your words and have an adult conversation about how she makes you feel. Not try to manage her feelings with a stuffed animal like she is five years old.", "Esh. Kinda comes across like a dick move to give her teddy bear like she's a child. \n\nHowever.... she's 36. She should have some more control over her emotions. I'd think if she's coming home from work every day this upset, she needs to find a new job. Or go to therapy to figure out what the issue is. \n\nIt's awesome she trusts you enough to want to come and vent to you about her issues, but when she's doing in a way that is making you feel like a punching bag or if your to the point your not looking forward to seeing her because of this, something obviously needs to be fixed.", "YTA. You do not get to tell other adults how to deal with their emotions. You can enforce boundaries that you will not engage with her when she's yelling.

You\u2019re incompatible because she feels she needs to yell when she vents and you get triggered by the yelling.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like you are at your wits end here.  The stuffed animal was a good idea for giving her a surrogate recipient for her episodes.  About the only thing I see wrong was your timing for giving her the stuffed animal.  I would have walked away, started scrolling on your phone, whatever until she calmed down then give her the stuffed animal.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you having the stuffed animal as a security blanket until you guys decide how you want to proceed with the relationship.  No one deserves to receive this or any other type of abuse.", "NTA. You are trying to find a way for her to vent her initial frustration without triggering your trauma.

Don't blame others assumptions on OP just because their statement of \"I've asked her to please stop or do it quietly, but she says it's just venting and perfectly normal.\" wasn't uber detailed and descriptive enough to fit the assumers standards. (idk if assumers is a word but I like it so it stays.)\n\nMy questions haven't been answered yet, but they don't need to be for my vote. How nice of you to assume that I made my decision based on an assumption... The irony... I based my vote on OP's replies to others stating that they have talked about the situation multiple times and asked in different ways, not on assumptions of what the answers would be. Regardless of whether or not the root cause of the trauma was discussed, if your SO asks you to stop yelling around/at them multiple times, then you need to talk to them and figure out what's going on.", "Yes, you actually can do both of these things. If she then turns her yelling to be directed specifically towards and about you after you have either asked her to stop or walked away, then she is clearly telling you she does NOT respect you and care about your comfort and feelings.

All these people acting like she should just be allowed to yell and scream whenever she's upset and trigger him. I absolutely cannot handle yelling particularly from romantic partners because of trauma from an abusive relationship where I was constantly yelled at over nothing. My current partner understands and is great about it, but when she's occasionally been frustrated about something and yelled (even when it's not directed at me) I have an awful panic response. Years of therapy have helped me build coping skills and figure out how to push through that response and self-soothe, but it still sucks, and some days you're just more worn down and stretched thin than others and you can't calm yourself down so easily. My abusive relationship was a small period of time compared to OPs ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, and those scars run deep. He deserves to be with someone who isn't constantly triggering him.\n\nThere's definitely a gender bias here too, even though few will admit it. I'm a transgender woman, and my abuser was a cis women who I dated before I transitioned. When people thought I was a guy being yelled at by his girlfriend, they didn't see me as abused, they saw me as whipped. No one took the idea of a guy being emotionally or verbally abused by his girlfriend seriously. Now it's been years since I transitioned, but people are far more understanding and willing to see me as a survivor of domestic abuse now that I'm out as a woman.", "Not the same scenario at all.  \n\nI didn't make a judgement and explained why.

No way to judge.", "No.  It's not okay for anyone to fail to consider someone's issues but we have no diagnosis for OP, we don't know why she says she's not yelling and he says she is - there simply put are zero specifics in this post.", "Then you aren't compatible. You asked for what you needed, she can't or won't do it. I can see why you tried the teddy bear thing, but the reality is she's a grown up and she doesn't agree with you - you can't \"fix\" that by assigning her a rage bear, and I'm not surprised she's pissed about it. It's condescending.\n\nIt's hard to say from the post if either of you are \"wrong\" - venting is reasonable, not wanting to listen to loud voices is reasonable. Maybe one of you is out of line, but it's more likely that you guys just aren't a good fit for each other.\n\nI think you gotta kindly but firmly end this. It's sad when a relationship ends, but if you two can't resolve this I don't see how either of you could live with it.", "In his comments he describes that if he tries to walk away from her she follows him and turns to shouting at him.\n\nThat is ridiculous behaviour.  It is abusive and it is wrong, and the guy needs to finally find himself a safe and quiet place in the world where he can rest and develop himself peacefully.", "I must admit I am sensitive because I had a female stalker for two years and then a jealous, abusive wife.  But, what I really feel here is that sense of having no rational way of dealing with it.\n\nWhat sent me over the edge is OP saying in a comment that if he walks away, she follows him and then turns on him.  He is in an awful situation, and to see people here going all softball on an abuser just because of her gender disgusts me.  \n\nI hope you are well, by the way.

Walking away just delays the fight until whenever you come back, because once you return it's a brand new fight about why you walked away. Until you're able to leave for good, the yelling lasts until they get tired of yelling, and all you can do is endure it. Makes you feel helpless and trapped and awful.\n\nI'm glad you are out and recovering. Its been about seven years since I got out, but it took me years after it was over to admit to myself that I was abused and start therapy to work through it.
