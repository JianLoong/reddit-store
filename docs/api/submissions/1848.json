They also tend to be passive aggressive towards me in the family gatherings and always would give a snide comment. Well one day... (After my wedding where they ignored me, not knowing what the reason why) I started blocking them from social media and their phone numbers. Then I went and told my husband and I do not like how his family treats me. My husband said \"that is just how they are\" and he is upset with me with the blocking since his family claim that they are hurt by my action. I did not care. To cap it up I also announced since I do not want to spend my holidays interpreting their backhand comments, I officially uninvited myself to any family gathering during the holiday. My husband can go though so I don't know why he is throwing a fit.\n\nUPDATE: my husband calmed down. He said he doesn't understand it but he respects it. I just want to let people know that my in-laws are not bad people. My husband is a great husband. Other than recognizing his family's treatment/comments toward me were inappropriate, and sometimes flat out hurtful. He views it as normal, I view it toxic. I never once told my husband to choose me over his family. I even told him that he can go on the day of the holiday and we will just celebrate before or after. My husband is a great guy, no backbone when it comes to his family, yes, but I believe one day he grows one. He got time. Besides it is not like I am gonna see his family sometime soon \ud83d\ude06.I am not perfect too, maybe I am sensitive.
