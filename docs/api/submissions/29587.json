Thanks in advance for reading my post. \n\nMy (37f) sister (30f) is in the process of divorcing her husband of three years. The divorce has taken a messy turn and they are battling for custody of their toddler. \n\nMy sister and I haven\u2019t spoken in nearly 6 years because she accused me of using her identity to get an apartment when I was in active alcoholism. I am now in long term sobriety, but at the time  I told her I didn\u2019t do it and she refused to believe me. She tried to have me arrested but the apartment complex\u2019s video surveillance showed it was actually someone she didn\u2019t know who had stolen her identity from a place she used to work. She never apologized to me for accusing me of this and she had told everyone and anyone who would listen that I had done it. However, when she realized it wasn\u2019t me she still didn\u2019t backtrack or tell anyone otherwise. \n\nFast forward to now. I am sober for a few years and my partner\u2019s sister is one of the top rated family law lawyers in our area. The lawyer my sister currently has is terrible and she lost custody of her daughter today. My mother called and said my sister called my SIL but she won\u2019t take her case because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable knowing how it would make me feel (or not knowing.) My mom wanted me to call SIL and tell her that my sister needs help and to please take her case. \n\nI told her no and that it\u2019s not my responsibility to help her. I\u2019ve never met my niece because my sister refuses to be around me even still. She got pissed and said I\u2019m the ah because I should be willing to help despite our past. For me, it feels like it\u2019s not the past at all and still very much the present. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit- thank you all very much. I still question myself and my intentions a lot since I got sober and started making changes to be a better person. It helped to hear everyone say the things I was thinking. I appreciate all the feedback very much. Much love.

You ain't the fire department here.", "NTA at all. Your sister is though....a major AH. She owes you a very big and sincere apology for falsely accusing your of identity theft.  Also, for telling others that you stole her identity and not retracting her accusations once you were vindicated via video evidence.\n\nShe cut you out of her life completely, including not allowing your to meet her child, but now is demanding a *massive favor* of your partner because she lost her custody case.

Your sister broke your trust years ago and has yet to try to mend it.

Wow, the entitlement is overwhelming here.  NTA.", "NTA. And it'd be a potential conflict of interest anyway, and your testimony about how your sister was great a decade ago is useless. And I dont even think you could promise that this great lawyer would help her, the lawyer would have to decide that.", "NTA. If your sister wants to hire your SIL she can, it has nothing to do with you.

For example it could affect your relationship with your SIL if she does help your sister and your sister is difficult to deal with or doesn\u2019t get the outcome she wants then takes it out on your SIL.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety and what your sister did to you is awful. She doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you and don\u2019t feel guilty for not wanting to help but you could also choose to take the high road and allow your SIL to help her if she wants to (without any family discount/special treatment of course).", "NTA.\n\nBurning bridges often comes at a steep cost.

Your sister could have apologized and told everyone she was wrong for the id theft accusation, but she didn't and now she has a consequence.

I will say that it\u2019s pretty AH move on her part to play middleman, ask a favour and then call you names when you don\u2019t want to give it. Favours are discretionary. Anyone who responds to you declining one by getting verbally abusive is the AH. \n\nLast but not least, you don\u2019t know if a strong lawyer will make a difference.

I'd want to know exactly what the agreement is: is she an \"every other weekend\" parent or a \"supervised visitation\" parent or just straight up totally lost custody, bc those are *very* important distinctions.", "And given how the sister has behaved previously, I wouldn't want to be in any way involved in what's likely to be a hostile custody case.", "Being honest, I have no idea if I got it correct or not. All I know is what my mom has told me about the situation. My niece wasn\u2019t in the car, thank god, but I can\u2019t speak 100% on any of the other questions because I haven\u2019t been privy to a relationship with her, her husband, or their daughter. Thank you so much for the clarity.", "This is very true. SIL knows much better than me about lawyer work so I very much do trust her judgment. Also, I needed to hear that she\u2019s a stranger. It\u2019s hard because we grew up very close but now I don\u2019t know her at all. I wouldn\u2019t even recognize my niece if I saw the baby in public because I\u2019ve never been a part of their lives. Thank you kindly.", "She was caught with a DWI last month, ex husband called for emergency temporary custody and got it. Today they went to court and full custody was granted to the father.", "Busted for a DWI", "This is what I thought. I was very much a drunk when she accused me. I know this, but she kicked me in my proverbial ass when I was already down and out by destroying what was left of my reputation. It was easy for people to believe I did that because I was struggling. I was a drunk, but I\u2019ve never been a thief even on my worst of days.\nEdit-spelling", "This is the exact thing my sponsor said. Thank you kindly for the reassurance.", "You're right, thanks for agreeing with what I literally said.", "Again, I don't think OP should do anything, all she has to do is not be a blocker. \n\n\"Don't let me influence your business decisions\"", "Also it doesn\u2019t matter if she has a shitty lawyer. Courts will often side with the mother by default unless there is a good reason not to. Even a shitty lawyer can win a case with that much bias towards their client if their client hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. So I\u2019m guessing there is a reason she lost custody that has nothing to do with representation. All good representation would have gotten her was a better visitation schedule.", "You're welcome.  I'm sorry your family are jerks. Don't back down!", "That removes the last shred of doubt. You are absolutely NTA. \n\nFirst, how do you know her last attorney was that bad? Maybe she is a lousy parent. \n\nSecond, your BIL needed help to get sober, and he decided the best way to start is to get away from her. There is a reason for that. \n\nThird, your sister has a history of making false accusations based on assumptions. What do you want to bet BIL was wrongly accused of things? \n\nFourth, everybody makes mistakes. And I can almost understand the mistake she made with you. But when confronted with proof, she was too immature to accept responsibility. Is this someone who should be responsible for raising children and teaching them right from wrong?", "Is Your sister an alcohoolic too? She got caught with DWI?", "She\u2019s the youngest so my parents have coddled her very much.", "I am so happy for you that your SIL is a gem. \n\nHow funny she used your relationship as sisters when she stopped being your sister to you years ago. \n\nI am glad you can confide in your SIL and I am sure your husband too. It shows so much growth and responsibility when you  take accountability for your actions.  \n\nI know someone who has been sober for over 20 years.  Their brother still treats them as an alcoholic.  Little digs.  Yet they wonder why they don\u2019t have a closer relationship.  Implies it is because my friend wouldn\u2019t be able to hide his drinking. It is infuriating.  \n\nSo infuriating that I said something.  First time I met the brother. I kept having him explain his digs. It made him look stupid and petty.", "This is what my sponsor said, too. \u201cNot your circus, not your monkey.\u201d I have been removed from the dramatics for so long while I got and remain sober, that it\u2019s important that I keep my nose out of it. This includes any \u201cfavors.\u201d Thanks for the sound advice.", "I just want to take a moment and praise you for all your hard effort in becoming sober and remaining so. You are amazing for this accomplishment. Congrats. \u2665\n\nAs for your sister issues: Don't let anyone push blame or guilt onto you after treating you like you were not part of their world for six years. Keep your focus where it needs to be for your own mental wellbeing.", "NTA.  Take away the fact she's your sister.  If someone treated you the way she did, would you help them.  I wouldn't.  Its not on you to get involved, especially if she never apologized.", "OP didn't block anything. SIL did. OP is only not taking action to unblock it. \n\nOP's sister could apologize and then maybe OP might be willing. But to her maintaining her pride/her ego is more important than access to her daughter. \n\nShe accused OP of a crime because they were an alcohol and now she's lost her daughter because she drove drunk. Kind of poetic in a way. \n\nAlso it's not like the niece, which OP has never met in 6 years, isn't going into the foster system but to live with her father and grandparents.", "When men fight for custody they get it an equal amount as women, they just don't fight for custody as often, stop this BS about it defaulting to women", "You\u2019re very right. I have no idea if he\u2019s been wrongfully accused or if she is a bad mother. I only know what I see in photos or what my mom says - which is obviously biased. I understood why she accused me too. In working through the 12 steps, I have taken full responsibility for my actions. I was in a bad way back then, truly. However, you\u2019re also right that she hasn\u2019t done the same. I truly thank you for your thoughtful responses.", "Yes, this was her second. There\u2019s always excuses from the family though so I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s an alcoholic. I know our dad is, and I am a recovering alcoholic. I haven\u2019t been around her enough in the past years to speak definitely about her situation though. I just know what I hear from family.", "Thanks so much, buddy! We come from a family of alcoholics, so I don\u2019t wish her any harm and hope she can find sobriety as I do anyone who has a problem. However, I can\u2019t be the one who helps with those problems.", "There still has to be some reason why it isn\u2019t shared custody. Sole custody isn\u2019t awarded for funsies. Judges aren\u2019t oafs who blindly believe what attorneys tell them. They are able to objectively weigh up facts of a matter. Unless of course it is shared custody and is being represented by the sister as losing custody. \n\nI will do more research on the matter of instances of custody awards mother vs father rates to better educate myself on the matter. My previous research when taking your stance showed that there did indeed appear to be a bias, but that was many many years ago so I\u2019m sure there has been some change since then.", "Hope you can sort things out! But whatever you decide to do, remember you are not responsible for your sister's actions and relationships.   \nStay strong with your recovery!", "I just read this yesterday and I know it\u2019s inappropriate but I\u2019m going to share it with you. \u2018The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed\u2019 NTA and KUDOS to you for getting sober and continuing to work your program.", "You do realize that if she still loses using your SIL as a lawyer, she's going to blame you? And she can make claims against SIL for purposely losing (or not trying hard enough) because she called you a thief.\n\nYou and SIL need to stay faraway from your sister.", "Wait, so your sister is an alcoholic?", "I didn\u2019t think of that. Thank you. You\u2019re very right.", "I\u2019m not sure. She got a DWI last month which is what triggered the whole battle. I\u2019m not familiar enough with her though to say for sure if she is or not.", "Congratulations on your sobriety. You just needed to get rid of that dead weight around your neck (your sister).", "Family is who we choose it to be and who we want it to be!\n\nI have a hand full of people in my life I consider family that I am not related to by blood!\n\nHuge hugs flying your way!", "One DWI wouldn't cause her to lose custody like that, there's more to it then you would know. Also, if her ex left so he could get back to being sober and stay there tells me she was doing some very stupid things.", "DWI with the kids in the car at the time might have triggered it.", "You may be right. This would be her second DWI. As bad off as I was as a drunk, I didn\u2019t drink and drive even once so for that I\u2019m thankful. I don\u2019t want to trash talk her, I just want to stay at a safe distance.", "Getting a DUI with the child in the car would cause her to lose custody.", "Possibly the kid was in the car.", "I didn't think about kids being in the car.", "Op keep taking care of yourself and keep strong on your journey. Live your life and leave the drama in the dust.", "This makes me think her child is actually better off in Dad\u2019s full custody and you not helping your sister will ensure that. Also? It\u2019s not trash talk to state the facts.", "Yeah she\u2019s an alcoholic.", "I didn't think about the kid being in the car."]}
