Thanks in advance for reading my post. \n\nMy (37f) sister (30f) is in the process of divorcing her husband of three years. The divorce has taken a messy turn and they are battling for custody of their toddler. \n\nMy sister and I haven\u2019t spoken in nearly 6 years because she accused me of using her identity to get an apartment when I was in active alcoholism. I am now in long term sobriety, but at the time  I told her I didn\u2019t do it and she refused to believe me. She tried to have me arrested but the apartment complex\u2019s video surveillance showed it was actually someone she didn\u2019t know who had stolen her identity from a place she used to work. She never apologized to me for accusing me of this and she had told everyone and anyone who would listen that I had done it. However, when she realized it wasn\u2019t me she still didn\u2019t backtrack or tell anyone otherwise. \n\nFast forward to now. I am sober for a few years and my partner\u2019s sister is one of the top rated family law lawyers in our area. The lawyer my sister currently has is terrible and she lost custody of her daughter today. My mother called and said my sister called my SIL but she won\u2019t take her case because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable knowing how it would make me feel (or not knowing.) My mom wanted me to call SIL and tell her that my sister needs help and to please take her case. \n\nI told her no and that it\u2019s not my responsibility to help her. I\u2019ve never met my niece because my sister refuses to be around me even still. She got pissed and said I\u2019m the ah because I should be willing to help despite our past. For me, it feels like it\u2019s not the past at all and still very much the present. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit- thank you all very much. I still question myself and my intentions a lot since I got sober and started making changes to be a better person. It helped to hear everyone say the things I was thinking. I appreciate all the feedback very much. Much love.

You ain't the fire department here.", "NTA at all. Your sister is though....a major AH. She owes you a very big and sincere apology for falsely accusing your of identity theft.  Also, for telling others that you stole her identity and not retracting her accusations once you were vindicated via video evidence.\n\nShe cut you out of her life completely, including not allowing your to meet her child, but now is demanding a *massive favor* of your partner because she lost her custody case.

Your sister broke your trust years ago and has yet to try to mend it.

Wow, the entitlement is overwhelming here.  NTA.", "NTA. And it'd be a potential conflict of interest anyway, and your testimony about how your sister was great a decade ago is useless. And I dont even think you could promise that this great lawyer would help her, the lawyer would have to decide that.", "NTA. If your sister wants to hire your SIL she can, it has nothing to do with you.

For example it could affect your relationship with your SIL if she does help your sister and your sister is difficult to deal with or doesn\u2019t get the outcome she wants then takes it out on your SIL.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety and what your sister did to you is awful. She doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you and don\u2019t feel guilty for not wanting to help but you could also choose to take the high road and allow your SIL to help her if she wants to (without any family discount/special treatment of course).", "NTA.\n\nBurning bridges often comes at a steep cost.

Your sister could have apologized and told everyone she was wrong for the id theft accusation, but she didn't and now she has a consequence.

I will say that it\u2019s pretty AH move on her part to play middleman, ask a favour and then call you names when you don\u2019t want to give it. Favours are discretionary. Anyone who responds to you declining one by getting verbally abusive is the AH. \n\nLast but not least, you don\u2019t know if a strong lawyer will make a difference.

And he STILL has partial custody.", "NAL but I work in law, you would be surprised how drawn out litigation can be and how quickly it adds up. It's not always about the quality of the attorney, but also how many billable hours someone can afford. You're not only paying the attorneys hours, you're also paying the paralegal's, legal assistants and sometimes the law clerks. so 3 people at 3 different pay tiers for what seems to be an hours work can easily be $1000. \n\nGoing back and forth through email is billed, phone calls are billed, case research, drafting, proofing all of it is billed to the client.", "The SIL refused the sister as a client without running it by OP first. Your accusations of her being a \"blocker\" are way off base.", "That's kind of my point. You don't know. OP hardly knows. All OP said was sister lost custody, and later in comments said it had something to do with a DWI, but even they don't know the actual details beyond some complaints from mom.\n\nSo you're condemning OP as an asshole for not acting when OP doesn't have the facts of the case to begin with. Maybe sister is mother of the year and really fucked up. Maybe sister is abusive. OP didn't have a hand in any of these movements, OP just declined to call SIL and press her into service for an unknown.", "it was in the post?????", "\"thanks but don't run this by me. This has nothing to do with me\"", "Oh, I don't read posts", "THIS! EXACTLY THIS! \n\nYour sister refuses to allow you to have  a relationship with her or her child. You need to stay faaaaar away from this situation, do not make any calls or use your influence.", "Even back then it was the same thing. Men rarely fight for custody, and in most cases custody is agreed on by both parties. My Mom got sole custody of me in the divorce because he didn't want it. It was sole custody, but he had open visitation whenever I wished it. Technically my state doesn't have sole custody, but it's what it effectively was. This buggers the numbers. Or in states that have it, it can mean different things. In many places \"sole custody\" doesn't relate to lack of visitation, but refers to the lack of rights to make decisions regarding the child. This makes sense when you have alcoholic parents, or parents that are otherwise too busy to really coordinate with. Some states might have it where Dad has weekends only, so Mom is declared the decision making parent because she had the kids more. It's less about an active bias against Dads and more a general issue with Dads not being an equal parent. Once we solve that, the problem goes away.", "For someone who won't even apologize for smearing her name? No.", "I am very happy to be wrong on this. As I said I previously took a very similar stance that it was because men didn\u2019t apply that more women got custody. I got yelled at by mean people that there was indeed a very clear bias and attempted to do some research. \n\nI came to a conclusion that there did appear to be a bias. Obviously a lot of details of cases are not available publicly since minors are involved. Mostly just outcomes are available not the reasonings/details of how it got there. And I didn\u2019t check every country/state/country either. \n\nI did also take personal accounts of fathers who did fight into account. \n\nAnyway all that aside I am as I said very happy to be wrong on there being a bias. And I do hope that is the case."]}
