I don't want to deal with this stupid situation on my main.\n\nEvery year around Easter, me and my husband visit his family for a week or so. We all go to his mother's house with his brother and his two young girls (5 & 7 years old). We've been together 6 years and it's always been what we've done. \n\nRelatively recently, my husband was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has always had some trouble mentally, but he's absolutely never acted violently or been excessively erratic. He has some auditory hallucinations, but if you didn't know, he'd just seem uncomfortable.\n\nWhen we told his mother, she was a little off put, but seemed generally supportive.\nThat is until a few days ago, when he was talking to her about our plans for the holidays. Apparently, she just straight admitted she didn't think we should come. She said that our nieces were afraid to have him there, and that they were too young to understand his situation. She thought it would be too much for him and it'd just make everyone uncomfortable, so she thought we should \"visit some other time\".\nHe didn't argue with her.\n\nHe told me about it that evening. He was clearly upset, but didn't say anything. Just said that she was probably right.\nI was fucking pissed. This is where I think I could be an asshole, as he asked he to leave it alone.\n\nToday I called her while he was at work. To be honest, I was very mean. I said that it was my brother in law's job to teach his children to be tolerant and they absolutely were old enough to understand. I said if she was willing to ditch her own son like that, she was a rat of a mother and we didn't want to be there anyway.\n\nShe called my husband in tears, and now his brother called me to say what an awful person I am and how hard this all is for her.\nThis whole thing just has my husband depressed, and he's angry at me for saying anything at all.\n\nI still think what she did was fucking awful, but she's not my mom. I think I might have just caused my man more grief than if I had just shut up. But it's not fair, and he shouldnt think he deserves that or that it's reasonable to not want him around. I just feel terrible about everything.\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1679638163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120b47u/aita_for_calling_my_mil_a_terrible_mother_for/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially considering the fact that he hasn\u2019t done anything and seems to generally have a good handle on his health. \n\nLike what was MIL expecting? She\u2019s treating her son like a monster when he hasn\u2019t done anything to deserve it. (Normally the opposite is the problem).\n\nThe only person to apologize to is your husband for overstepping and for his sorry excuse of a family. Chances are he\u2019s always had schizophrenia, the only difference now is the actual diagnosis.", "NTA I\u2019ve worked in psychiatry for over thirty years. People with schizophrenia go through hell with their symptoms but they rarely if ever hurt anyone else.  If he was floridly psychotic (noticeably) it would be different.  It doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal.  If the kids have to be told,\ntell them  that their uncle has an illness that sometimes makes him act differently.", " No you\u2019re not the AH. What she\u2019s doing is awful and it sounds like the whole family is on board with her shitty behavior. I would distance myself from them and do everything in my power to make sure my husband knew that I supported him. Is he getting any treatment at this time?", "NTA your husband's mother is though. Unless there's been some issue from your husband's condition that wasn't mentioned, nothing's really changed at this point, has it?", "NTA but your MIL sure is. As someone with mental health issues myself with a mother and half of my in laws who have mental health disorders as well, definitely not the AH. We can function around family get togethers just fine and there is no reason why anyone with a mental health disorders should be excluded like that. Maybe you both should just go no contact with those family members.", "NTA.", "INFO - have his nieces always been uncomfortable in his presence, even before the diagnosis?", "NTA. I had a friend with fairly severe paranoid schizophrenia (which when it was bad it was to the point of police involvement a number of times because he was simply completely unable to regulate his behaviour in public or private or make sense of reality) and you wouldn't want him knowing your address never mind coming to events. That is a totally different kettle of fish from a few auditory hallucinations presenting to everyone else as discomfort, shutting someone out of the family based on what is effectively someone going through a hard time is gross and good for you for laying down the law.", "ESH.  You have the moral position, but you're correct that handling it the way you have has likely caused more grief for your husband.  It would have been better to have presented a united front, rather than speaking on his behalf.  That being said, I'm sorry y'all are in this situation--uninviting someone based on a controlled mental illness seems very heartless.", "I'm so sorry you and your husband are going through this.\n\nProbably not going to be popular but there is no way, in good conscience, that I could say OP is TA. Yes, MIL and BIL are upset but sometimes people need to be shook up and hear how awful they have behaved to actually take a step back and understand what they've done. How could they (especially MIL) be so hurtful in husband's time of need? I applaud OP for the fierce defense of her husband.\n\nOP, I do agree with other commenters that apologizing to your husband may be good. I'm sure that as he is able to think about why you did it, he will accept your apology and he will see that it came from a place of passionate love for him. We all make sometimes mistakes in the heat of the moment to protect someone we love. I also hope that the true AH's in this situation (MIL & BIL) will think about OP's words for what they really are - amazing love and protection of their own family who is guilty of nothing except receiving very upsetting and scary news.\n\nAnd one more thought - why in heavens name that that AH involve the nieces??? Ridiculous and ignorant, IMHO. Ugh!\n\nNTA  - I truly wish you the best and hope that his family realizes how unbelievably cruel they've been and work to repair the damage. Then they will appreciate the amazing, fierce, protector their loved one married! :)", "Esh  you should have respected what ur husband asked and not called them .and we'll ur mil she is horrible horrible", "NTA either way, but I'd be interested to know his age. Schizophrenia usually debuts between 20 and 30 years of age (iirc). Is this something that he's had for a long time, but never told about or never realised was pathological? Or is this something that started recently? If it's been a long time, it's probably a good prognostic sign that it's a relatively mild condition. If the hallucinations are recent, it could explain why the family is uncomfortable.\n\nMental illness is still so very stigmatised, and schizophrenia very much so. I think it's very good of you to stand up for your husband (though it sounds like you possibly could have been a bit gentler). The risk is that he loses contact with his family, gets isolated and further stigmatised. If it was my brother and my children, I'd present it as the doctors having found a reason why uncle X sometimes feel sad, or worried (or whatever his symptoms) but he's still the same person, and has gotten medication to help him feel better.", "ESH. It\u2019s really close though. You\u2019re barely an asshole. Your MIL probably didn\u2019t really think through what she was saying and the implications and somebody needs to communicate that to her. Going to against your husband\u2019s wishes doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to me, but doing it in a dramatic, mean-spirited way does. You amped up the drama of an uncomfortable situation and now it\u2019s going to be more difficult to resolve. That said - if it were me, I\u2019d probably be the asshole too.", "NTA some family he has if they are not even helping him with this diagnosis but instead trying to distance them selves from him. i don't blame you for calling her a rat but i think rat was too good for her but she is something that i wont put on here due to kids being on reddit", "YTA \n\nHow was this going to make anything any better?   I get you were mad.  And I agree, they handled his diagnosis poorly.   But you had to know there would be collateral damage when you insulted his entire side of the family.   I wish you would have just told her the truth.  That he was devastated to hear that he wasn\u2019t invited, and that they\u2019re misunderstanding the diagnosis\u2026. (For a condition he might have had his whole life).  \n\nHe needed an advocate in this situation.", "YTA.  You had every right to be upset and angry on behalf of your husband.  I would be too, but I would refrain from calling his family to chew them out.  That almost always just makes the situation worse.  Calmly discussing the situation with them is fine but your husband had specifically asked you to leave it alone.  You really should have.  You may have honestly unintentionally made his issues worse as stress can worsen schizophrenic episodes.  The fact that his brother is so not understanding of how this mental disorder works sucks.  Most people think schizophrenia means dangerous.  They are wrong but God help anyone who tries to educate them.  You need to apologize to his mother for your outburst.  You were out of line.  You also need to apologize to your husband for making things worse for him.  You should do whatever you can to start a new Easter tradition for y'all to enjoy together or with friends if this will be your new norm.", "NAH - your response is as natural as the the mother's.  \n\nThe mother is very ignorant and doesn't understand that he has had mental challenges for a while.  \n\nYou do not want you SO to endure any more hardships as he struggles and tries to find an effective treatment plan.  \n\nMurdering each emotionally will not help the person.  Kindness, caring, and support are essential.  \n\nThat is were the MIL is journeying into the territories of her asshole.", "YTA you disrespected your spouses wishes to make yourself feel better. You didn't help you made it worse.", "ESH, except the husband. I inviting you guys from Easter was absolutely terrible, and her reasoning is garbage. I understand hearing schizophrenia might sound scary because of stereotypes in movies, but if there\u2019s never been an incident there is absolutely no foundation. She raised the man, she should know everything is all good. The BIL should not have told his kids. It\u2019s absolutely none of their business and depending on their age they may be too young to fully understand. If they don\u2019t notice anything, don\u2019t mention it. YTA for blowing up on your MIL. All you did was hurt your husband ever more, and make the situation worse. It must suck seeing him be in that situation, but that response in no way is going to help! Did you even try to talk to her and get her thoughts and explain his diagnosis? Or did you immediately explode, and thing hurting her was the best way to make this better? Just a very immature, reactive response. Your husband needs stability and a shoulder to cry on. You didn\u2019t give him either of those things.", "Oh, man. I really want to give you a pass. Cause that\u2019s some mofo\u2019in righteous anger.\n\nBut alas\u2026 ESH.\n\nYou made a hard situation worse. His mom of course is an AH for obvious reasons. I think depending on her age, how she was raised, and how comfortable they are discussing mental illness, this could take some time for her. Not excusing, just explaining.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s a possibility that the reason for the behavior change could be irrational guilt? One of the primary risk factors for schizophrenia is inherited genetics. Maybe she did some internet research and\u2026.I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s pure speculation. Just me trying to make something sad make sense.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry y\u2019all are going through that. I wish all of you well, sincerely.", "Oh honey, ESH. \n\n    You're NTA but your delivery was.\n\n     I know how you feel. My husband and I both have \"issues\"; we're non neurotypical, we're a lil bit broken, whatever term you want to use. I use our eggs are cracked. I have auditory hallucinations and he is schizophrenic, so we get it. We've both been excluded from family functions hosted by certain family members because of their ignorance. It hurts. Sometimes, it can hurt bad. It's wonderful that you recognize and accept your husband's \"eccentricities\", I adore you for that. Unfortunately, due to the historic portrayal of mental illness in the media most people have a very warped idea of the symptoms, actions and feelings of those who are different. It sucks, but there it is. And everyone has the right to restrict access to their home/safe space as they see fit...even if it is for an idiotic reason. I'm sorry for that.\n\n     Here's where the lil bit of YTA pops up. This is your HUSBAND'S family. You can feel enraged at their lack of compassion, understanding, and familial affection but it is ultimately up to your husband to exchange word with them. It is HIS family, HIS feelings, and it can only delt with effectively on HIS timeline. You really should apologize to your husband for stepping on his toes, going above his head in his family decision and your disregard for his feelings in the matter. You did it out of love. Now love him some more. You MIGHT want to think about apologizing to his mother for blowing up at her. Do not apologize for your reason for doing so. It is valid. But it was not your place to put her in hers. \n\n   If your husband's family is having a hard time understanding the cracks in your husband's bedrock there are books out there, for ALL AGES, that can help them understand & maybe teach them some empathy. They sound like they need it. If that doesn't work, your more than welcome to join mine. My weird little found family loves everyone and we celebrate everyone's weird and wonderful strangeness.", "YTA. You made everything worse and now it\u2019s dumped twice as much on your husband. Good job.", "A gentle ESH.\n\nI would\u2019ve done the same thing you did, to be honest. When my protective mode activates sometimes the rest of me just shuts down. But I would be wrong to do it, and you were wrong to do it as well.\n\nDealing with a serious mental illness means being under very real threat of losing your agency\u2014either because your illness takes it from you, or because someone else does it \u201cfor your own good.\u201d By intervening in his family relationships, you\u2019ve undermined your husband\u2019s agency at what sounds like a very vulnerable time for him. He gets to decide how he wants to handle those relationships, not you.\n\nBe a supporter, not a crusader, because that\u2019s what is called for here. You might say, \u201cI\u2019m so, so angry at how they\u2019re treating you. I want to say a lot of very unkind things to them right now, but: how do YOU want to handle this?\u201d You might ask, \u201cHow can I support you? If you don\u2019t want to visit, is there something you\u2019d like to do instead?\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t do something you know he doesn\u2019t want you to do in the name of protecting him\u2014because that\u2019s not really for him at all. It\u2019s for you. It\u2019s for you, because you love him, you\u2019re afraid for him, and you\u2019re watching people hurt him. It is horrifically painful to watch someone you love be treated so callously, by his family, at the time when he needs them the most. And who could blame you for wanting to relieve that pain by giving them a piece of your mind? Not me.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: those are YOUR emotions\u2014and yours to manage. He has his own, and they need to take precedence, because he\u2019s the one on the front lines of this, not you. This is happening to HIM, first and foremost. So let him take the lead. Don\u2019t try to fight the world for him, tempting as it may be. Instead, stand beside him, hold his hand, and face it together.\n\nThat\u2019s my advice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
