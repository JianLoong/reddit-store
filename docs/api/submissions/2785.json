She's given a few task to take care of as her form of payment. Those things include cooking, cleaning and watching over her little sister occasionally when my wife & I go out somewhere.  A few days ago I invited my friends over for dinner. My wife was gonna cook up something for us as she usually does but unfortunately the day before they were to arrive she was feeling a bit nauseous, but told me it would probably go away the next day(it didn't). \n\nMy wife told me the next day she felt even worse. I didn't want to make my sick wife cook dinner, so I asked my daughter who was free at the time if she could do the cooking instead. She got an attitude with me and said I should just order take out. Where I'm from it's rude to invite a guest over for dinner and feed them fast food. I told her we made an agreement that she had to abide to & if she didn't fulfill it she would suffer consequences. We went back & forth for a little bit to which she eventually said fine and made dinner for us. But ever since then she's been avoiding me and gives me short answers when I try to spark a conversation with her.\n\nI understand asking her to cook dinner for my friends out of the blue is what made her upset and her anger is somewhat justified. But at the same time we made an agreement that she has to fulfill, so I'm conflicted on if I was entirely wrong for asking her to cook for us.\n\nI do not view my wife & daughter as servants who are beneath me. We just follow a tradition that advocates for certain roles within the family.", "created_utc": 1668944502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z021yl/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cook_dinner_for_my/", "score": 680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't owe you anything just for being your child.", "YTA for a few reasons:\n\n1. You shouldn't invite people over to a home where someone is sick and should cancel the event.\n2.

When she said why cant you get takeout, that was your time to choose how you acted. You could have said im sorry its not really the done thing, i would really appreciate if you could help me. Cooking isnt my strong point so i need your help on this one.\n\nAt that point is another time to choose how you act. Instead of going i cant do it, its your problem now. How about doing it together. Tell her youre not the best but you can do some chopping for her, fetch what she needs etc. Its actually a good moment to spend time together, learn about your daughter. You could also use that time to learn to cook something different. Im sure your wife would be greatful of the surprise if you learnt something new and surprised her with it.\n\nLastly, instead of threatening (which is a pretty dick move), why not use it for something positive. Yes she has chores to do, but dropping something sudden is outside of what she usualy does, dont expect to strong arm it and think thats the best option. You could have spent time with her, made the food together, learnt something new. All that instead of a fight. Was she going to be eating with you? Or was she cooking for you guys and getting out of the way? If she was eating with you, you could have said if you will make the meal, ill pop to the shop and get what you fancy for pudding. If she wasnt eating with you, you could have said oh you mentioned takeout, how about we call out for pizza for you, make it two and we'll have pizza for brekkie.\n\nThis one i think falls down to being appreciated. Everyone wants to be appreciated for their contribution. Now not only does she feel unappreciated she likely feels small as you threatened her. \n\nI dont know your household situation so im going to make an example. Say you are the sole earner in the house. You come home from work, kids are going out the door to meet friends. They hold their hands out for cash, dont bother saying thanks and shout bye while half way out the door. You sit down to talk to your wife a out your day. She gives you 2 mins, rolls her eyes then changed the subject. Shes just booked a fancy holiday. The cost is above what you can really afford and youre not sure you can actually have those days off. When you say something she says urgh its just work, youre the money man, just make some more money and take the days off anyway. You now feel under-appreciated and a little taken advantage of. \nIts a bit of an extreme comparison but its the same concept. No matter what a person's role in the house/family they always want to feel appreciated.  Things being sprung on you, expected to just be dealt with because you are 'x' person often cause problems. Also short notice things are generally seen as favours not demands.\n\nTalk to your daughter, apologise for threatening her, thank her for helping you.\nNext time talk to her like a person, not an employee. Appreciate her.", "YTA", "INFO - how many guests?", "ESH.  Cooking seems to be part of the way she pays rent and she is an adult.  However, it is possible to order food that isn't fast food.

She's given a few task to take care of as her form of payment. Those things include cooking, cleaning and watching over her little sister occasionally when my wife & I go out somewhere.  A few days ago I invited my friends over for dinner. My wife was gonna cook up something for us as she usually does but unfortunately the day before they were to arrive she was feeling a bit nauseous, but told me it would probably go away the next day(it didn't). \n\nMy wife told me the next day she felt even worse. I didn't want to make my sick wife cook dinner, so I asked my daughter who was free at the time if she could do the cooking instead. She got an attitude with me and said I should just order take out. Where I'm from it's rude to invite a guest over for dinner and feed them fast food. I told her we made an agreement that she had to abide to & if she didn't fulfill it she would suffer consequences. We went back & forth for a little bit to which she eventually said fine and made dinner for us. But ever since then she's been avoiding me and gives me short answers when I try to spark a conversation with her.\n\nI understand asking her to cook dinner for my friends out of the blue is what made her upset and her anger is somewhat justified. But at the same time we made an agreement that she has to fulfill, so I'm conflicted on if I was entirely wrong for asking her to cook for us.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hypothetically, you\u2019ve invited several people and would like to entertain and chat rather than have to tend to food while the friends are there.

I don\u2019t want to cancel it, but, as you know, I\u2019m a terrible cook and you\u2019re better at this than me. Plus, I\u2019d really like to be able to enjoy the night with my friends. Do you think you could please pitch in here and help me out by making the meal Mom was going to make or maybe something you\u2019d enjoy making? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d If after that approach she scoffs and says \u201chell no, get McDonalds, you stupid old man.\u201d Then yes, she is kind of an asshole.

I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole to want her to cook and to be disappointed that she didn\u2019t want to. However, this situation is only a sign that you and your daughter need to set the boundaries and expectations of her living with you.

It would just be the cherry on top of daughter chose to never get married and live alone for the rest of her life because of some archaic bullshit her dad imposed.", "I'd really like to down vote this because of what he said but I won't do that to you.

And are usually the most critical about how those things are done. The food for instance has to meet a particular standard. Clothes have to be ironed just so. And so on. But they won't lift a finger to do any of those tasks.\n\nI saw it happen a lot in uni. Had friends who'd go to their boyfriends' rooms or houses. They'd cook, clean (do it themselves or organise for and pay someone to do it for them), do the shopping etc. Some even wrote their term papers for them coz the boyfriends couldn't be bothered or were too busy watching football and school deadlines still had to be met. Had this one roommate who was always with her boyfriend. This one time he hadn't come over and I asked where he was. I mean, they were ALWAYS together. Said he was studying for an exam. Asked her if she was doing the same exam (they were in the same program). Said yes, but that the boyfriend would be hungry afterwards so she had to stay back and cook for him. I fought hard not to be drawn into those kind of relationship dynamics coz that's the cultural expectation. Had partners offer to be paying for all the ingredients and have me cook the food all the time. I was like, I'm more than happy to pay for my own groceries and do my own cooking. And I expect you to do the same. Or we go halfies on everything. That wasn't usually received that well. Still isn't. And you get words like \"too independent\" thrown at you like insults. And whenever a relationship ends as they do, people who weren't part of the relationship and have no idea what did or didn't happen, will quickly jump in and say that's the cause. \n\nAnd even now I still see it happen all the damn time. It's maddening. It takes a lot to keep that rage inside and not say anything. But the women do sign on for that kind of treatment by continuously giving in. I'm glad OP's daughter is slowly fighting back.\n\nEdit: 2 words.", "Where I work we use volunteers at the welcome desk (usually older ladies in their 70s) and the hardest shift to find is 11-1 because all the ladies need to be home to make their husbands lunch or I guess they\u2019d starve. I asked one once (i think it was Ruth) if her husband couldn\u2019t just make himself a sandwich and she looked at me horrified. Her husband needed a hot lunch and would never just accept a sandwich. And I can\u2019t even say it was political, I had liberal and conservative volunteers but none of their husbands would walk into a kitchen.", "My grandfather was like this after my gran died, completely incapable of doing anything by himself, cooking cleaning and even picking out his clothes.\n\nOnce a cousin in her 20s was at his house, it was \"her turn to be the woman in the house\". She left out some of her clothes on the bed to put on after a shower and my grandfather put them on assuming they were for him since they were laid out.\n\nSo my cousin confused when to prepare breakfast for him in the kitchen to find him in tiny low rise jeans and a hot pink belly top with a glittery red heart on it (early 2000s)\nAlso this was about 10 years after my gran had passed", "Awe, I'm glad he realized what an idiot he was being lol a lot of people just dig their heels in. I think cooking in particular can be kind of scary for someone who has never done it. I was always in the kitchen with my mother so I learned to cook there. If I hadn't, I imagine I would be kind of scared about using heat and making a fire or giving myself food poisoning.", "Yep, it's funny now.....\n\nMy dad was like that, so when my mother went to hospital to give birth, I'm not kidding, for over a week all we had were EGGS. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. That's the only thing he knew how to make. Scrambled, soft boiled, hard boiled. I was 5yo then and will never forget that time. The worst thing was that my grandma (dad's mum) was a chef but she wouldn't help out cause she didn't like mum.......", "It reminds me of the time I went out for the day to go to a bridal shower a couple of hours' drive away. Husband, autistic older son (then 8) and younger son (then 6) stayed home. I was out of the house from nine in the morning until maybe 7 that evening. As soon as I walked in the door my husband and younger son started clamoring about how they were hungry.
