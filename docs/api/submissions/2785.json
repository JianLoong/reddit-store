She's given a few task to take care of as her form of payment. Those things include cooking, cleaning and watching over her little sister occasionally when my wife & I go out somewhere.  A few days ago I invited my friends over for dinner. My wife was gonna cook up something for us as she usually does but unfortunately the day before they were to arrive she was feeling a bit nauseous, but told me it would probably go away the next day(it didn't). \n\nMy wife told me the next day she felt even worse. I didn't want to make my sick wife cook dinner, so I asked my daughter who was free at the time if she could do the cooking instead. She got an attitude with me and said I should just order take out. Where I'm from it's rude to invite a guest over for dinner and feed them fast food. I told her we made an agreement that she had to abide to & if she didn't fulfill it she would suffer consequences. We went back & forth for a little bit to which she eventually said fine and made dinner for us. But ever since then she's been avoiding me and gives me short answers when I try to spark a conversation with her.\n\nI understand asking her to cook dinner for my friends out of the blue is what made her upset and her anger is somewhat justified. But at the same time we made an agreement that she has to fulfill, so I'm conflicted on if I was entirely wrong for asking her to cook for us.\n\nI do not view my wife & daughter as servants who are beneath me. We just follow a tradition that advocates for certain roles within the family.", "created_utc": 1668944502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z021yl/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cook_dinner_for_my/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why didn't you make dinner? I feel like that's a totally unreasonable request if you are able bodied yourself.

She doesn't owe you anything just for being your child.", "YTA for a few reasons:\n\n1. You shouldn't invite people over to a home where someone is sick and should cancel the event.\n2.

When she said why cant you get takeout, that was your time to choose how you acted. You could have said im sorry its not really the done thing, i would really appreciate if you could help me. Cooking isnt my strong point so i need your help on this one.\n\nAt that point is another time to choose how you act. Instead of going i cant do it, its your problem now. How about doing it together. Tell her youre not the best but you can do some chopping for her, fetch what she needs etc. Its actually a good moment to spend time together, learn about your daughter. You could also use that time to learn to cook something different. Im sure your wife would be greatful of the surprise if you learnt something new and surprised her with it.\n\nLastly, instead of threatening (which is a pretty dick move), why not use it for something positive. Yes she has chores to do, but dropping something sudden is outside of what she usualy does, dont expect to strong arm it and think thats the best option. You could have spent time with her, made the food together, learnt something new. All that instead of a fight. Was she going to be eating with you? Or was she cooking for you guys and getting out of the way? If she was eating with you, you could have said if you will make the meal, ill pop to the shop and get what you fancy for pudding. If she wasnt eating with you, you could have said oh you mentioned takeout, how about we call out for pizza for you, make it two and we'll have pizza for brekkie.\n\nThis one i think falls down to being appreciated. Everyone wants to be appreciated for their contribution. Now not only does she feel unappreciated she likely feels small as you threatened her. \n\nI dont know your household situation so im going to make an example. Say you are the sole earner in the house. You come home from work, kids are going out the door to meet friends. They hold their hands out for cash, dont bother saying thanks and shout bye while half way out the door. You sit down to talk to your wife a out your day. She gives you 2 mins, rolls her eyes then changed the subject. Shes just booked a fancy holiday. The cost is above what you can really afford and youre not sure you can actually have those days off. When you say something she says urgh its just work, youre the money man, just make some more money and take the days off anyway. You now feel under-appreciated and a little taken advantage of. \nIts a bit of an extreme comparison but its the same concept. No matter what a person's role in the house/family they always want to feel appreciated.  Things being sprung on you, expected to just be dealt with because you are 'x' person often cause problems. Also short notice things are generally seen as favours not demands.\n\nTalk to your daughter, apologise for threatening her, thank her for helping you.\nNext time talk to her like a person, not an employee. Appreciate her.", "YTA", "INFO - how many guests?", "ESH.  Cooking seems to be part of the way she pays rent and she is an adult.  However, it is possible to order food that isn't fast food.

She's given a few task to take care of as her form of payment. Those things include cooking, cleaning and watching over her little sister occasionally when my wife & I go out somewhere.  A few days ago I invited my friends over for dinner. My wife was gonna cook up something for us as she usually does but unfortunately the day before they were to arrive she was feeling a bit nauseous, but told me it would probably go away the next day(it didn't). \n\nMy wife told me the next day she felt even worse. I didn't want to make my sick wife cook dinner, so I asked my daughter who was free at the time if she could do the cooking instead. She got an attitude with me and said I should just order take out. Where I'm from it's rude to invite a guest over for dinner and feed them fast food. I told her we made an agreement that she had to abide to & if she didn't fulfill it she would suffer consequences. We went back & forth for a little bit to which she eventually said fine and made dinner for us. But ever since then she's been avoiding me and gives me short answers when I try to spark a conversation with her.\n\nI understand asking her to cook dinner for my friends out of the blue is what made her upset and her anger is somewhat justified. But at the same time we made an agreement that she has to fulfill, so I'm conflicted on if I was entirely wrong for asking her to cook for us.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sorry.", "lmfaooooooo you could ask OP the same question??? since HE invited his friends over and HE insisted there was to be a home cooked meal, HE could have put his big boy pants on and made them a god damn home cooked meal! he\u2019s a full grown man with two hands, he can figure it out instead of demanding labor from his daughter.", "really? she lives there with her parents and it is not as if he asked her to juggle a car. it's cooking and that's it.
