I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re right, just that this is how they are.  It\u2019s your call whether you want to go au natural, shave, or wear something that doesn\u2019t show your underarms.  I support whatever choice you want to make.\u201d\n\nMy husband and I had a similar discussion about his family and dressing more conservatively before I first met them.  It was my choice how much skin I showed, but I knew in advance that they were rather judgey on that front, so I was aware of how my choices were likely to be received by them.", "YTA. She likes it, as she told you... and what's important is what SHE THINKS about her body (and body hair). \n\nDid she ask your opinion on if she should shave? No? Then she doesn't want it, so keep it to yourself. \n\nHumans have body hair naturally. That's the baseline for \"NORMAL\". It's NORMAL for her to have hairy armpits, and she can make a choice to remove it. If your family find normal body hair offensive or weird, that's their problem, and you should feel free to tell them that. \n\nYou may soon be single because of these sexist views.", "Do you have hairy armpits? Why does she have to shave hers? Because she\u2019s a woman and you\u2019re a man? If you\u2019re allowed to have hairy armpits, so is she.\n\nBtw, it was completely normal for women to have hairy armpits until shaving sales went down during WW1 AND WW2. so companies advertised women shaving their armpits to make sales.\n\nthat\u2019s literally the only reason why. having a hairy armpit is not toxic or dangerous to your health.

I truly don't see this as any different than asking my boyfriend to trim his beard or have a fresh shave for an event.  \n\nI am also a woman who mostly doesn't shave her pits but sometimes does.  I don't think my boyfriend would ever ask me to do it since he likes my armpit hair, but I wouldn't be offended if he did.  I'd probably joke that he was reinforcing gender norms and then just do whatever I wanted to do and it would be fine.\n\nAnd to everyone saying dudes don't shave their armpit hair before events, they also don't have it showing.

It could be the way you asked her. If she didn't shave her armpits ever, and you asked her I would say you are, since she sometimes shaves I don't see the harm in asking for the first time she meets people that are important to you for you to ask.\n\nIf she wasn't going to wear a strappy dress again you would be, However sounds like the perfect storm for her to be pissed off for no reason to me. You shouldn't judge her for not wanting to shave, you should respect her choices with her body hair. However, if the sexes were reversed and you mostly shaved your face but let it grow scruffy often and she was taking you to meet the family and asked you to be clean shaven you wouldn't get upset about it would you? It appears to be the same to me. You aren't asking her to shave all the time, you aren't telling her you disapprove of her letting it grow a bit.\n\nSo I think you must of worded it wrong, or been insensitive when or how you asked.\n\nTalk to her, be honest and tell her the truth. Tell her you don't care about it normally but this is a special occasion and you support her wearing a strappy dress if she shaves her armpits, or she can wear something that covers up her pits and not shave. You just don't want your parents, Mostly your dad I am sure. to think she is weird or unclean. He will judge her for sure if he sees her unshaved arm pits. Old people are assholes like that, I know I am one.\n\nETA: I can't believe how many people in the comments are making this about Feminism and Sexism. This is about making a good impression on people that are important to the person you love! I can't believe it is even really an issue. \"Hey sweetheart, I know you don't usually but could you shave for the family gathering?\" should be a normal conversation in a relationship. If she is offended by it, and he didn't word it badly, she is too sensative over it. If it bothers him, which he stated it doesn't, that is a different conversation. He just wants her to shave to meet his family, would he be an asshole if he asked her to get her nails done? Would she be an asshole for asking him to shave his face? It isn't about the hair its about respect for your partner.\n\nStay Strong and communicate!!", "YTA.\n\nBody hair isn\u2019t weird. It\u2019s just natural.

His partner doesn\u2019t mind it generally, but he\u2019s going to be meeting her family and she knows they\u2019ll think he looks scruffy. So she asks him to brush his hair. Is she the asshole in this situation? \n\nWhat he\u2019s doing is \u201cnatural\u201d in this case. He didn\u2019t ask her opinion.
