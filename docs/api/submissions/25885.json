I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re right, just that this is how they are.  It\u2019s your call whether you want to go au natural, shave, or wear something that doesn\u2019t show your underarms.  I support whatever choice you want to make.\u201d\n\nMy husband and I had a similar discussion about his family and dressing more conservatively before I first met them.  It was my choice how much skin I showed, but I knew in advance that they were rather judgey on that front, so I was aware of how my choices were likely to be received by them.", "YTA. She likes it, as she told you... and what's important is what SHE THINKS about her body (and body hair). \n\nDid she ask your opinion on if she should shave? No? Then she doesn't want it, so keep it to yourself. \n\nHumans have body hair naturally. That's the baseline for \"NORMAL\". It's NORMAL for her to have hairy armpits, and she can make a choice to remove it. If your family find normal body hair offensive or weird, that's their problem, and you should feel free to tell them that. \n\nYou may soon be single because of these sexist views.", "Do you have hairy armpits? Why does she have to shave hers? Because she\u2019s a woman and you\u2019re a man? If you\u2019re allowed to have hairy armpits, so is she.\n\nBtw, it was completely normal for women to have hairy armpits until shaving sales went down during WW1 AND WW2. so companies advertised women shaving their armpits to make sales.\n\nthat\u2019s literally the only reason why. having a hairy armpit is not toxic or dangerous to your health.

I don't think my boyfriend would ever ask me to do it since he likes my armpit hair, but I wouldn't be offended if he did.  I'd probably joke that he was reinforcing gender norms and then just do whatever I wanted to do and it would be fine.\n\nAnd to everyone saying dudes don't shave their armpit hair before events, they also don't have it showing.

It could be the way you asked her. If she didn't shave her armpits ever, and you asked her I would say you are, since she sometimes shaves I don't see the harm in asking for the first time she meets people that are important to you for you to ask.\n\nIf she wasn't going to wear a strappy dress again you would be, However sounds like the perfect storm for her to be pissed off for no reason to me. You shouldn't judge her for not wanting to shave, you should respect her choices with her body hair. However, if the sexes were reversed and you mostly shaved your face but let it grow scruffy often and she was taking you to meet the family and asked you to be clean shaven you wouldn't get upset about it would you? It appears to be the same to me. You aren't asking her to shave all the time, you aren't telling her you disapprove of her letting it grow a bit.\n\nSo I think you must of worded it wrong, or been insensitive when or how you asked.\n\nTalk to her, be honest and tell her the truth. Tell her you don't care about it normally but this is a special occasion and you support her wearing a strappy dress if she shaves her armpits, or she can wear something that covers up her pits and not shave. You just don't want your parents, Mostly your dad I am sure. to think she is weird or unclean. He will judge her for sure if he sees her unshaved arm pits. Old people are assholes like that, I know I am one.\n\nETA: I can't believe how many people in the comments are making this about Feminism and Sexism. This is about making a good impression on people that are important to the person you love! I can't believe it is even really an issue. \"Hey sweetheart, I know you don't usually but could you shave for the family gathering?\" should be a normal conversation in a relationship. If she is offended by it, and he didn't word it badly, she is too sensative over it. If it bothers him, which he stated it doesn't, that is a different conversation. He just wants her to shave to meet his family, would he be an asshole if he asked her to get her nails done? Would she be an asshole for asking him to shave his face?

His partner doesn\u2019t mind it generally, but he\u2019s going to be meeting her family and she knows they\u2019ll think he looks scruffy. So she asks him to brush his hair.

I actually grew a beard once, she hated it, asked me to shave it, I did, I was not offended at all.\n\nShe does actually shave her armpits, so do I, because I find I sweat more with armpit hair.\n\nIf she didn't shave, I would probably be the same, I would tell her because we are always open with each other and I prefer it that way.  But this particular situation has never come up.  Been together for 27 years. \n\nHowever, OPs situation is totally different.  He's embarrassed by it, that's a whole different kettle of fish, they need to sit down together and be brutally honest with each other and discuss their relationship moving forward.  \n\nOP is asking her to shave for all the wrong reasons.", "A lot of things are considered unhygienic or at least out of place without affecting anyone else physically.

Since the beginning of humanity, women had hair. Less isn't none, so that isn't a counter. \n\nWhat actually happened was that capitalists felt that they weren't making enough money off of men shaving so they marketed shaving to women as being feminine and that problem has festered ever since. It's recent history and a recent problem. That is the truth, women shaving but men not shaving is nor normal and is very new age in the grand scheme of things and globally speaking. \n\nSo no matter what, the expectation is still sexist and unreasonable. \n\nAnd in ancient times where shaving did exist, men shaved equally. It has never been natural for shaving to be sex-specific, it's very new. \n\nAnd you are entitled to preferences when you're looking for a partner.

There is no liking someone but not liking 1 thing. \n\nHe either likes her or he doesn't. Unless he's breaking up with her, it's not a preference, it's disrespect. \n\nA woman isn't going to date a short guy and demand he wears platformers or get leg lengthening surgery. She would just not date him. The male equivalent is to not date her, but you can't become her boyfriend then be an ass after. You either like her as she is or you move on, you don't get to say \"she's perfect but I don't like this one thing\" and date her, the vslidity of that opinion went out the window when he agreed to date her because he agreed to their hair, you can't agree to having only parts of a person, you either accept them or you don't. \n\nAnd if your preference is that you sexistly think that women should perform labors that men aren't expected to just to make sexist men's insufficient penises happy when he probably can't find the clit or make her cum while expecting her to look like an unnatural anime waifu, then fine, you do you, but your preference is only as valid as your acceptance of the fact that it's sexist and disrespectful of women's existences and that you get to be judged for it, your preference is only as valid as other's opposal to your preference, and as ling as you aren't actively dating someone because onde you date, you're either all in or all out, you don't get to prefer parts of s person, to not prefer parts of someone is to effectively date someone you don't like so you gotta break up or learn to be a good partner.", "Go look at OP's 2 comments. It is about sex, and expecting women to shave is an inherently sexist topic. \n\nHe had his choice before he started dating her, if he wants a bare woman he should have found one instead of disrespecting his girlfriend and doubling down when she said no. \n\nAnd yes, hypocrisy about expected labor matters. It's not valid to repeatedly ask someone to do something that you think you shouldn't have to do. It's disrespectful and entitled.", "If they don\u2019t like her because she has armpit hair then why would she want to even meet them to begin with.

It's such a great read, and hasn't become any less relevant today.

Not because I'm ashamed of either of those things, but because I don't want to hear about it. \n\nI dont think it's crazy at all.

I am also confident that my partner has my best interest at heart and wouldn\u2019t say something to purposely offend me because they have no reason to do that because why would they want to purposely offend me? To what end? Beard and armpits may also not be the same thing. Meeting the family i think in general people tend to dress nice and neat to make a good impression. When i met my partner\u2019s family, i had to wear long sleeves because i have a few tattoos, did i get offended when he asked to cover them because the family is religious? No. Because it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to get offended at something so trivial. Make a good impression then go do whatever you want with your partner because yea, at the end of the day your partner knows their family better than you, and when you guys are alone or not under the watchful eyes you can dress how you want and keep all the body hair that you want. \nIm sure she knows not everyone is accepting of armpit hair which she tends to shave now and again, and she shaves everywhere else as per the post so it was natural for OP to ask because he knows she\u2019s not strictly keeping her hair on her body. \nWhy must there be such a huge leap to him not being accepting or offensive or not supportive when he has been the whole time? If he was pestering her to shave all the time, then yes, in my eyes he would have been the A because he knew what he was getting into. But she does shave. Lets not take that out of the whole context. \n\nThe question was not that serious or that deep. People are quick to get offended over silly things.", ">I can guarantee my family would judge a girl fairly harshly for having armpit hair. They wouldn't not like her, but there would be judgement. \n\nMy family would totally judge and talk about her too. It'd also probably lead to some sort of nickname. This is reality plus my family is full of jokesters so they don't need anything extra to poke at. She may not have issues with the criticism from strangers, but significant others families can be hard to navigate sometimes, especially in the getting to know each other phase, and they may say things that really sting. \n\n> If this were say, a traditional Indian family and they asked their partner to dress a certain way before meeting them, this comment section would be entirely different.\n\nYes. Commenters would be saying she didn't love him and he should run. Reddit's finest advice givers.", "I mean agree to disagree. I\u2019m not going to change who I am to impress someone and it seems as his girlfriend is the same way. My mind instantly went to she probably would of shaved if he had not said anything. Lol off topic but just wanted to throw that in. Idk I\u2019ve chatted this discussion into the ground. Appreciate your response and have a good evening."]}
