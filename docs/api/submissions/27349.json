We moved for his job so I'm in between jobs. It was agreed that he would take care of the finances until I find and start my job. This is the first time he's had to support the family on his solo income.\u00a0(I do add in 1k per month from my savings)\n\nHe's previously been pretty bad with finances and never worried. He said himself, this is the first time he has been anxiously waiting for each paycheck. I have the means (savings) to help him out but I want him to experience hardship and learn money management so I haven't offered to help out financially (and he hasn't asked, though he does ask me daily when I'll start my job). Our income is currently less than our expenses.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, I told him he must have an emergency fund, but he never bothered to save\u00a0up for it. He'll have like 2k in emergency fund (our family expense is easily 6-8k now). He's also learning to look at prices before buying and weighing wants vs needs. I feel like it's a time of personal growth for him.\u00a0\n\nWould I be an AH to continue this for 2 more months just so he can grow?\u00a0\n\n(he's always irked me because he'll always say \"don't worry about it\" but then if we come up short, I have had to foot the bill. Ie. when we had our baby, I told him we owed like 3k and he was like \"oh, I have no money\" which was super annoying).\n\nFYI- I have not been delaying work. It takes a few months to change jobs in my field (between solving for new license/paper work and 2-4 weeks after working to actually get my paycheck. He\u2019s completely aware of the timeline. I tried to tell him he can\u2019t afford it in his income but he disagreed and said he\u2019ll make enough. \n\nHe forgot to account for rent increase (from 1.5k to 4.5k), daycare cost, and his own tax\u2026 therapist suggested me \u201cso maybe don\u2019t save him next him?\u201d Because he has learned that I will always be the financial safety net", "created_utc": 1695325442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16op9fp/aitah_for_letting_my_husband_face_financial/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have read through the comments and your replies. I think that with you contributing and waiting for your job to start this is an excellent growth opportunity for him and hopefully he will not revert back to old habits when you are back to work. I\u2019d suggest also sitting down and mapping out a family budget together that includes covering combined bills and expenses, preparatory savings for big items like replacing a car, vacations, etc - a personal discretionary spending fund, retirement savings,  and also a household emergency fund as you recommended. \n\nHowever you want to break all this down is up to you both but learning how to manage spending in this time of reduced income is an important learning experience - in these very uncertain times anyone can end up out of work at any time without advance notice. Saving for that is important.", "NTA\n\nThis is a very tough situation. Like everyone else, my first inclination was to say \"go talk to him, show him you're in it with him\". \n\nBut, it sounds like:\n\n1. You've had a lot of discussions with him about it and he has not changed his irresponsible behavior.\n2. You have bailed him out repeatedly before, which, for a responsible adult should have been so mortifying that he learned and changed his ways. That he didn't is very worrying.\n3. While everyone is reaming you for being \"condescending\", I can think of few more condescending statements in this context (where you have been the responsible one who has repeatedly bailed him out) than \"don't worry about it\". (The \"little lady\" and the pat on the head are implicit.)\n\nI hope that you stick to your guns and that the experience is eye opening for him.", "I don't see you as that much of an AH here. Sounds like your husband has done the financial f*ck around part and now he has to find out for himself. \n\nAlso sounds like you moved for a good opportunity for him, so I think you have already been generous enough to use some of your savings.", "Is it the best way to handle the situation? No. But you discussed it prior to everything happening, and he assured you that it would be ok. You aren't the asshole for being able to look at the situation and realize it's not going to be ok while simultaneously choosing to trust your husband has you and your family's best interest in mind. If you don't give him a chance to prove you wrong, you'll always be stuck feeling like you're his safety net when he isn't yours.\n\nFrom what I'm understanding, you aren't putting off getting a job for 2 more months; you are actively working on getting that started but it's not an instant circumstance. What you are asking is more in regards to continuing to let him prove that he's got it under control while you in fact know he doesn't. My interpretation (OP, please correct me if I'm wrong) is that you are wondering if you'd be the asshole to not jump in and help, vs letting him have that moment to realize and come and ask for help. \n\nProvided my interpretation is correct, then I'm going with NTA.", "NTA. The bar is really in hell for men.", "NTA\n\nYou've done enough in the past, it's time he learns how adults behave and survive on their own. It's like you were his mum, always there when he needed because he can't budget properly. He's learning, that's good. \nWhen you have a job again, you'll contribute again, but for now you're being coherent and let him handle the situation. \n\nThe only suggestion: when things are balanced again, try couple therapy so he doesn't lose the things he has learnt in this tough time.", "NTA. How many times can you communicate to your spouse that you need them to be your PARTNER on a specific topic, before it becomes warranted to treat them like they behave - which is, like a child?", "Actually, I am going to say NTA.  Your family is not in danger and your husband needs to get his shot together financially.\n\nI can say this because I have a spouse prone to financial fuckery.  The man makes 6 figures and was always broke.  Always in huge amounts of debt.  I stopped being his safety net and he had a few hard financial hits before he started being somewhat responsible", "NTA, lol\u2026 jeez people she\u2019s not shoving her naked kid into the deep end of a pool after giving him a nougie and walking away with a nonchalant \u2018you\u2019ve got this\u2019 over the shoulder and not looking back.\n\nThe kid said hey mom watch me! She grabbed his arm and put on floaties and gave him a smile and a pat on the back as he ran to do a cannonball in the deep end.  Sure he still doesn\u2019t know how to swim but he\u2019s got floaties and she\u2019s watching like a hawk, and SHE can swim.\n\nLet\u2019s see if hubby can learn to swim!", "NTA and I absolutely agree with your approach here. You\u2019re not \u201cpunishing\u201d him as others mentioned - you both agreed that he would cover finances, and you\u2019re just not rushing into \u201csave\u201d him this time around. People are acting like you\u2019re leaving him homeless under the bridge - you\u2019re not, you\u2019re actually doing something really wonderful for your family moving forward by allowing him to fully carry the mental load of finances so that he can support you both in that area moving forward. Kudos to you!", "NTA your husband clearly has no sense of money if he thinks he\u2019s being a good boy by simply not buying a new iPhone. Shows entitlement and it\u2019s fair to want him to learn the value of money when he\u2019s clearly not responsible with it.", "NTA, he\u2019s learning. He told you not to worry about it when you tried to share this burden with him before when you were in the planning phase. He said he had it under control, and you said your therapist told you to let him struggle if he made a mistake. He needs to learn to be an adult with his money and budget.", "NTA\n\nWe did this twice  - the first time was my husbands choice, but we had little cause to worry. The second time was a joint choice, but my husbands transfer took 2 years to arrange. \n\nIn the scenario presented - he instigated the change, didn\u2019t fully appreciate the financial consequences, and you are now sitting back and letting him burn. \nNTA", "NTA.  He needs to carry a load and worry and sweat it out. 2 more months.  Just see what happens.  Because this is your entire life he is playing with.", "NTA. You are contributing, even though you could more. It is time he learn some financial responsibility. I agree with your therapist", "NTA\n\nHis emergency fund is a joke for a family, and his undisciplined approach to finances is childish and unsustainable. I've dropped girlfriends in the past for similar behavior.\n\nHe forced you to worry about the money before this AND skipped out on bills. And now his mouth bounced a check. \n\nDon't let the situation damage his or your credit, especially if you're planning on buying a house. But other than that... make sure he's learned his lesson.", "No you are not. Even without working you are contributing drink your savings and he can't manage without you. You moved for HIM. He should've made sure the money was worth the move. You cannot continuously save your partner after you sacrifice for your partner. He did not think things through. And it's not your responsibility to think for him to save the day EVERY DAY!!", "YTA. He obviously has some maturing to do, but this is not the way to teach him. Marriage is a vow to combine two lives and work in tandem on life\u2019s obstacles. Maybe, through his financial immaturity, he\u2019s been putting in less than his full effort. But now you\u2019re doing the same. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right; You\u2019re cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "I'm confused about all the comments berating OP for not contributing and for allowing her child of a husband finally have his consequences.\n\nFirst, she DOES contribute $1,000 a month. (I sometimes wonder if everyone reads before commenting.) Second, he knew the facts before HE took a job elsewhere. And finally, it is STILL a thought process for him to debate buying a new $1,000+ phone when he can't even make ends meet. \n\nThis is financial abuse. He expects OP to make up his shortfall again and again. OP, stop calling this teaching him a lesson and see it as logical consequences. You have protected him from the consequences of his choices until now. Just step off and let him have the consequences of his choices. Stop bailing him out. Stop thinking of it as teaching him a lesson. It isn't your job to teach a grown man lessons. It is your job to take care of your side of the fence and leave him to take care of his without saving his ass every time.\n\nNTA", "NTA as long as bills are being paid I don\u2019t see why you should deplete your savings any further. They have a child. The whole family  benefits from your savings too when it\u2019s necessary. He clearly needs to learn to budget better. If you\u2019re not around how will he get on with just him and your child? \n\nIf you keep pulling from savings because he can\u2019t  budget you\u2019ll eventually be broke too.", "Don\u2019t listen to these people you are not the AH. He said he\u2019d cover expenses. End story.  You are simply staying out of the way and. It jumping in to rescue him.. and remove real world obstacles does not make you an asshole. You aren\u2019t suppose to be jumping on to rescue him\u2026 and FYI you\u2019re also not supposed to interfere with children. Who are you to hobble him and be a savior anyway?", "NTA. I seriously don't understand the yta votes here.", "NTA sometimes you have to play a parent who's watching their kid scaling the biggest tree. \n\nI'd never have that trust in anybody except me. That freedom you gave him would make me so anxious.", "NTA. Either you combine finances and you handle finances or you let him struggle. He needs to learn.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to learn sometime, better it happen now when there is still funds you Could use if things really go tits up vs later when there is nothing left to cushion the fall.", "Unpopular opinion probably: ESH, it\u2019s a Union, take care of each other or don\u2019t.

You\u2019re not his flipping mom.", "Crazy how women marry men just to end up being their mommy. I could never.", "Lol why is op responsible for her husband's incompetence? She said and tried to explain several times how to budget and save for an emergency fund. The husband was the one changing jobs and op reminded again of the further difficulties of relocating and his response was \"relax I got it\"\n\nHe clearly is careless with money and I'm sure OP won't let her family get evicted, but money management is no joke. This will probably help him understand the consequences of his poor management.\n\nNTA, and for people saying marriage is a team, yeah it sure is! Go tell that to op's husband when she told her to manage his finances for the best interest of the household!!!", "ESH- marriage is supposed to be a team effort. I get having separate finances for personal treats but you should\u2019ve planned out shared bills and expenses before you got married. Why did you have a baby with a man who has no sense of managing money?", "OP I understand what you are doing but honestly what you wrote and your replies makes you sound like a mother talking about her child - his consequences, putting him on an allowance. When you said you\u2019re seeing him grow I imagine you patting him on the head like a toddler saying Good boy. While you\u2019re breaking him, to remake him into what you want please praise him for things and Watch his mental well being. Stress and anxiety can cause physical ailments and depression. (I would hope if something ever happened like an illness or accident where he couldn\u2019t work you would step up and not just say that he should have had an emergency fund and not help him).", "NTA if this is what he agreed too.\n\nBut holy hell I've spent more money on girlfriends or vice versa and had my girlfriend help me loads of times for a few months. We always pay it back in some way or another, but when you live together as a couple.... you help each other. Not saying the man doesn't need to learn though, because no way no how does he need a new phone, much less the IPhone 15 now??", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA but my concern would be so you think he\u2019s actually learning in the long term enough to change his habits, or when the transition is over will he go back to being clueless? Because his behavior and outlook up until now is pretty clueless. Have you tried the sit down and do spreadsheets etc. conversation now that he is \u201cgetting it\u201d more?\n\nI can see how this would be enormously frustrating but you are still partners in the end.", "NTA.

Stay like this 2 more months.", "NTA. \nYour husband has been so quick to write you off every single time you have a concern, over and over. \nHe's fucked your finances over and over. \nHe NEEDS this lesson. \nI just hope it works.", "NTA. I agree with your therapist. Don't save him and let him learn. If he doesn't learn now, he will always expect you to ride in on a white horse and save the day. \n\nIf he cannot meet his financial commitments, why should you save him for the rest of your lives?\n\nThere is a risk here. Just be aware and make the best decision for you, your husband and your child. \n\nDo you want to take over the finances and manage everything? That's a huge job... but it is easier than dealing with a fiscally irresponsible spouse.", "Yeah, I may be the oddball here but nta. He's gotta learn and sometimes that hurts.

Why is there daycare expenses since, as you point out, you aren't working?  \nYep, very interesting,  very distant couple.", "YTA Unless you return the favor when you start working and cover the expenses for the same amount of time that he has after you start your job. Maybe he can use the extra funds to save a bit.", "NTA. I\u2019m not crazy about the paternalistic attitude toward his learning, but he made a commitment and it\u2019s not unreasonable to hold him to it if you\u2019re otherwise acting in good faith with your job search and no one\u2019s health or shelter is at risk.", "The whole separate finances but married is a concept I will never understand.", "I guess I could be misreading (or an idiot), but I don\u2019t really understand this\u2026 I mean, maybe he knows you\u2019ll be his financial safety net because he\u2019s your husband?

He\u2019s doing partial days right now bc I still want time w him but he\u2019s also using this time to adjust to daycare. He\u2019s loving daycare btw. It\u2019s a specialized daycare. They have \u201cclasses\u201d and activities. From music class to language classes. Interaction w other children, etc.\n\nSo what would happen when I can start my job? Delay my job and wait for a daycare opening?", "1) I don\u2019t understand how you are ok saying i have no impulse control. I can\u2019t  budget. Sorry but if your husband passes it sounds like you are in big trouble by just brushing it off.\n2) I say number one to point out the flaw - you can let him manage it all but you need ot be able to budget. My wife lets me handle everything because I\u2019m very good at investing and budgeting our lives. BUT she knows how to not overspend if she has a budget. She knows how to manage a budget. If I pass, she\u2019ll have to learn a bit more about the investments (they are rather complex and outside her scope of skills whereas budgeting is mandatory skill) BUT she\u2019ll be ok and not blows through all the money she is given.\n\nA few months of this pain, where they are obviously both splitting the earnings - might finally teach him to not blow through his money. More importantly perhaps he\u2019ll start saving for retirement also - which from the budget OP described - they will need both doing it.", "We do this and we also budget a \u201cguilt-free allowance\u201d per month for each of us. If we don\u2019t spend, it gets rolled over. So we can save up for \u201cfrivolous\u201d wants for ourselves. I am crap with money, my husband is a control-freak about it. It\u2019s not that he minds me spending, he just doesn\u2019t want to be blindsided with a massive c/c bill at the end of the month :) But he makes sure I know the state of our finances every month and we keep a comforting balance in individual savings accounts in case one of us needs urgent access - like in case one of us dies and the bank screws up access to joint accounts (it\u2019s been known to happen).", "Is this OP\u2019s alt account? You\u2019re relying on information that was not in the original post, which it should have been if it were so important to the issue at hand. And you\u2019re getting *awfully* upset about the financial / marital struggles of strangers.\n\nIf you think this is a healthy way to behave towards someone you love, then go nuts. I\u2019m not going to argue that this isn\u2019t an incredibly callus and petty way to treat your life partner. What\u2019s the point of being married if you\u2019re not going to help each other through the struggles of life?", "Yes. He isn\u2019t respected.  How could he be?  He is tanking the entire team and hasn\u2019t tried to come to grips with planning and supporting.  Poor OP. Sometimes, like a parent teaches a teenager, you have to let them head off into the ditch. If they cannot correct course, or will not, then you help.  He is not even in the ditch.  He is an ineffective planner, partner, and adult.  It\u2019s time to see how far into the ditch, weeds, swamp he is willing to drag his family.  OP will fix any and all off course excursions. But then she will finally see how far he was willing to risk his family.  And she will realize- does he or does he not have capacity to be a proper partner.", "Apparently we are wasting our breath. People are content to crap on the OP not even realizing that the op\u2019s husband is probably screwing family over for retirement let alone this little blip. Others are content to be completely screwed if their spouse passes because they can\u2019t manage a basic budget. The lack of responsibility in this thread is actually mind blowing.", "That\u2019s not in the OP, is it? She just mentioned \u201clooking at prices\u201d and \u201cweighing wants vs needs.\u201d (Which I might add, is entirely subjective. It\u2019s very easy to dismiss someone else\u2019s needs as wants)\n\nI also think it\u2019s condescending to consider a new phone a childish, frivolous expense. It\u2019s not like a bought a new Xbox. \n\nPeople need reliable access to communication. For anyone under the age of 50, that means a smartphone. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s husband\u2019s fault that capitalism relies of planned obsolescence.", "Why does he have to pay for the 3k hospital bill? Shouldn\u2019t they both pay for that?\n\nAll I\u2019m seeing is clear examples of how ridiculous it is for a married couple to have separate finances. They need to budget together!", "If I budgeted like him, I wouldn\u2019t have a savings. \n\nHe told me savings isn\u2019t needed and he can cover the entire family\u2019s cost. I told him he couldn\u2019t. He said he could. So\u2026", "WHAT THE FUCK IS HER PART?!? Holding his hand and guiding him like he's a widdle baby?"]}
