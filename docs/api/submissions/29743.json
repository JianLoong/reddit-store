Usually I would have said yes, and I felt a bit bad because he was very polite, but it's an airport and I had heard about 20 announcements during my layover saying not to leave baggage unattended and to notify police of unattended baggage.\n\nAnyway, he gave me a very dirty look, and some other passengers seated nearby said \"Of course we can watch it for you\" and also gave me a dirty look.

Mine goes to the bathroom with me.", "NTA.  Like you said, they announce constantly about unattended luggage. This is an instance where it isn't worth the risk of trying to appear polite. Don't mess around at airports. I'd have done the same (and then ruminated over it as you are because it was uncomfortable)!", "NTA-never watch some random person\u2019s luggage. If you see abandoned luggage in an airport, report it right away.", "NTA. You did what you're supposed to do. You don't know this person, you don't know what's in the bag. Too risky.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your responsibility so it\u2019s not your problem, besides, it\u2019s way too risky to leave a bag with someone you don\u2019t know or watch a bag from someone you don\u2019t know, what if there were drugs in there? That\u2019s just way too risky.", "NTA.\n\nWorse case scenario: there's a bomb that goes   off.\n\nNot quite so bad: there's drugs in there and you get arrested for trafficking.\n\nBest case scenario: it's just luggage.\n\nYou do what works for you.", "Yeah, you are totally not supposed to watch someone else's luggage. It is a security risk.", "NTA.\n\nThose rules are in place for a reason.", "NTA. There's explicit rules against that, for very good reasons. Good on you for standing your ground.\n\nAlso, he can just take his luggage with him in the bathroom. It's not that big of a deal and I do it basically every time I fly.", "NTA. This is basic airport security and has been for decades. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA. If you can't bathroom with your luggage you have too much crap.", "NTA \n\nThey make announcements about it for a reason. Also, idk about anyone else but I\u2019m not leaving my luggage with a stranger.

They explicitly state that for good reason. Not your problem.", "Am I the asshole for doing what any sane person would do?????", "NTA I would never leave my stuff to be watched by a stranger so I dont get him even asking.", "NTA (I would have said NAH if she hadn't given you dirty looks). It's ok to ask and it's ok to refuse.\n\nSide note: in my opinion the repeated unattended luggage announcements AFTER you've passed security check are a bit over the top. Anything dangerous in those bags would have been found already.

Sad, unfortunate reality nowadays. Life used to be so very different. Nowadays you cannot \u201cwatch.\u201d Passengers need to take luggage wherever they go. Such, sad reality. You did right thing.", "NTA. You should only be doing that for someone you know personally. And honestly, people shouldn't be taking so much luggage that they can't bring it to the bathroom with them anyways. It's carry-on.", "NTA. That\u2019s how some people get set up as a decoy mule. Major safety risk and it could be a set up", "NTA. That is highly suspicious behavior.", "NTA - you did the right thing; it could have been a bomb, drugs, anything.", "NTA No one is worth that kind of risk.  Give me all the dirty looks you want.

You did the right thing.", "NTA. \nI was in a airline lounge today and some lady asked me to watch her (very expensive) luggage while she went to the ladies room. \nI kinda feel like it\u2019s more risky to ask a stranger than to just take it with.

What idiot asks a complete stranger to watch their valuables?", "NTA for following basic safety rules.\n\nIt is curious though that someone would want a stranger to protect their bag from other strangers. How would they know which strangers are the bad ones? \n\nAlso, this was carryon luggage, aka portable. For all you know there were illegal items he wanted to disassociate from himself in front of law enforcement, or he was the sort of person that you were being warned about in the announcements.", "YTA that's not what 'unattended baggage' means though.", "NTA.  You have no idea who he is and by watching his luggage you're now responsible for who knows what is in it.", "NTA. Anyone up to no good would ask you politely. It\u2019s not worth the risk these days.", "You don't leave your luggage unattended.\n\nYou do not leave your luggage with anyone you do not both know and trust implicitly.\n\nYou do not watch the luggage of someone you do not both know and trust implicitly.\n\n\nThose are all rules for a very very good reason. And even if they were not, for your own good, you should always stick to them like your life and freedom depend on it, because they might.\n\nAdditionally, we all manage to bring our luggage into the washroom at the airports with us just fine. He can manage, and it's suspicious that he refused to. It's probably nothing, but it is suspicious.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I would have done the same thing.  \nYou had no idea what was in that luggage.", "NTA. If it exploded you'd be blamed. If he called in a bomb he'd describe you", "There's a reason airports don't want anyone leaving their luggage unattended.  It's a potentially serious security and safety issue.  For the person leaving the luggage, illegal substances might get slipped into the luggage.
