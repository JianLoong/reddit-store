Stupid for him to ask.", "NTA, lots of airports have stalls big enough to get the whole luggage trolley in, you take that shit with you.\n\nGot moaned at through a toilet stall door in the ladies\u2019 by airport staff for leaving my backpack at the toilet sinks while in the middle of making obvious puking noises in the stall (sleep deprivation) here the UK. If you don\u2019t have a travel companion you need to take it with.\n\nThat said, the gate is after security, no?", "Yta if the bathroom is close and you can see them going there.", "NTA. Vast majority of carry-ons I see people with these days have wheels, OP does not mention this, but I bet dollars to donuts this thing was a roller. Not a terrible hardship to move. I will help fellow travelers put bags in/pull them from overhead bins or pull checked bags from the carousel if help is needed, but will not be responsible for luggage if the owner is not in sight.", "NTA, I understand why you were doing it", "NTA. It's an airport in 2023, you can't do that. \n\nYou were appropriately polite by simply not reporting him.", "A sketchy person would be polite, after all!  (Sincerely)  NTA", "Yes, you captured my feelings exactly hahaha! It made me so uncomfortable to say no just because I usually follow social conventions, but this was too far.", "NTA. Same. I travel alone often and bring it with me to the restroom. Yes, it's inconvenient but I don't want anything missing or added.", "Good thing the bag has already gone through security then eh?", "Even better scenario, you hide it somewhere.", "I'm Indian and I wouldn't do this. There are warnings all over airports to avoid exactly this situation. It's nothing to do with Americans and everything to do with drugs.", "I'm Icelandic, so about as \"tiny country and everyone knows everyone\" as you can get. In an international airport, ifwe were going on the same flight and were waiting by the gate I might watch a stranger's luggage, especially if they were Icelandic (it's a thing), but I wouldn't wait for them if my plane was boarding and I had to get going. In a domestic airport in Iceland I absolutely would watch someone's luggage, no questions asked", "That is your privilege talking.. people get detained so easily at airports. You have literally no idea what risk are you talking about. Your statement of Americans vs others easily shows who you are.", "As an American, I would (and did last week) be happy to watch someone's bag while they ran to the bathroom. Dude last week brought back Auntie Anne's pretzels and gave me one. You feed me and I'll watch anything.", "Have you people ever been to an airport? This is a mundane interaction that happens many thousands of times a day. If you call security about someone having another waiting passenger keep an eye on a bag while they go pee, security will think you\u2019re a massive freak.", "Lol...so dramatic", "Like what are you supposed to do if someone else tries to move the person\u2019s bags? \u201cHey, that belongs to someone who stepped away for a few minutes and I\u2019m guarding it for them!\u201d \u201cYeah? And I\u2019m moving it so I can sit down.\u201d", "If they\u2019re at the gate it\u2019s probably a carry on. So the dude can carry it to the shitter.", "I don't want to piss with my bag or have my bag on a piss stained floor. I also want my seat by the gate saved. You watch a bag for 5 minutes and then call security if you gotta leave. \n\nCan't believe people think a bomb bag past TSA is such a high risk you can't help a person out during already hard enough air travel.", "I would never watch someone else's luggage. It's not worth it! \n\nJust remember, you will probably never see these individuals again. Who cares what they think of you for the \\~5 minutes of your life.", "Most people on reddit probably don't travel regularly. I bet everyone was through security already, how paranoid to not say \"sure\" and just keep your ass seated. If it was a bomb in there the guy wouldn't have asked strangers to keep an eye on it.", "First time I've seen Americans accused of being sensible lol", "Privilege? Because I\u2019d watch someone\u2019s bag 2 minutes while they had a piss? What airports are you going to?! It usually is the Americans who\u2019re self centred and lack empathy though.. literally look through the American comments on this thread..", "I mean, why not be responsible for your own stuff? Is that so hard? Oh yeah, probably trying to \"save\" their spot. Amazing how arrogant people are who literally assume they own public space", "If your luggage is in front of a seat, especially one near a power outlet, and you\u2019re not there, I\u2019m moving it and sitting down. You are TA.", "Oh well. That's the chance you take.", "Unfortunately that is what traveling alone entails. I travel alone frequently and have never thought to ask a stranger to be responsible for my belongings. The stalls in airport bathrooms are specifically made larger to account for people bringing their luggage with them.", "Just incredibly self centred people who see it as a chore somehow", "I\u2019ve had them let me through with pepper spray (I didn\u2019t realize it was there) but pull me aside and question me over a tuning fork.", "Really? In England we grew up with announcements all the time about unattended bags. Just take it with you. (Also, if they don't come back quickly for whatever reason, I'm not going to babysit their stuff while my plane starts boarding.)", "Yeah OP says sitting at the gate. There\u2019s barely any way possible some random guy going for a piss and asking you to look after his bag has a bomb in it", "Dude you aren't aware of how rest of the world gets treated at airports if they aren't white if they are found anything suspecting. It's not empathy when it comes at a cost to you. Its good that you are unaware, because that means you don't have to travel being extra cautious, ensuring there is no mistake you make. I am honestly happy for you.\nOne request, before responding please do check out news different scenarios where people have gotten stuck at airports because they have been taking care of someone else's luggage.", "It\u2019s not unattended if someone is watching it.. the second part of your comment is common sense too, obviously no one would", "Canada has CATSA, does the EU/other countries not have similar airport security? Genuine question, as I've only ever flown within Canada and our airport security is just as strict as the US so I just assumed all countries were, especially post 2001.", "I know certain airlines have a size max for the size of your carryon. And you can only have your carry on plus like a backpack.", "I'm not sure of the maximum weight, but I flew Air Canada Express a couple weeks ago (super tiny plane) and we were permitted a personal item (like a purse) and one carryon, as long as they fit in the overhead or under the seat. Anything more than that or over the size/weight had to be checked. I ended up having no one seated beside me, so I was able to use both under seat spaces for my purse and backpack, which was awesome cause I'm so short I can barely reach the overhead.", "not at the gates, once you're by the gate you would just get your boarding pass scanned and you can pass through to the plane.", "Ah right, it's the same thing here, I just kind of glossed over the part where OP was already at the gates \ud83e\udd23"]}
