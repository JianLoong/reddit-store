Earlier today the boys all had their annual physicals, I took them to the doctor, my wife was at work. After the doctor, we had free time because the boys were off from school due to the appointment. Our appointments were for when they first opened.\r  \n\r  \nFord asked if we could go shopping for Christmas decor, given Halloween is finally over. Ford is one of those people who loves to go all-out for Christmas, it\u2019s his favorite holiday and he always decorates his room full of Christmas stuff. I agreed to it and took the boys to some stores to look for decor. \r  \n\r  \nFord bought quite a bit of stuff, Kian and Orson were also able to buy stuff, I told the boys I\u2019d buy them whatever they wanted. Ford was especially excited about a few baseball related Christmas decor he got (as well as a few non-christmas baseball things), Kian got a few items for his room, like decorative pillows.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue came with Orson. Orson is not into decorating or anything like that, he also has more niche interests (for lack of better word) like animes, science, ect so we normally go to more antique/thrift type stores for him. I had offered to take Orson after this but he said he didn\u2019t want to go.\r  \n\r  \nOnce we got in the car after we were done in the home decor stores, I was going to drive the kids to lunch, but Orson started complaining and saying some really disgusting stuff. He started telling Ford that decorating and design is for \u201cf slurs\u201d (he used the actual slur), he started complaining that this made Ford \u201clook gay\u201d. I told Orson to stop and that this was inappropriate, but he continued to rant on, and started complaining about Ford in general, saying that everything he liked was \u201cre\\*\\*\\*\\*ed\u201d. At this point, I tell the boys we are going home and that we\u2019d go out for lunch later. \r  \n\r  \nWe just got home a bit under an hour ago. I tried talking to Orson, but he refused, saying he did nothing wrong. I asked where he learned that language and he said it didn\u2019t matter. I then told him to give me his phone, and he refused until I told him he could have some of our extra Halloween candy if he gave me it.\r  \n\r  \nI looked through his phone and found absolutely disgusting texts in a group chat that him and about 10 other boys he\u2019s friends with are in: incredibly racist memes, making fun of autism and ADHD, anti-LGBT stuff and more.\r  \n\r  \nI just called my wife trying to tell her that we needed to sit down when she got home to discuss this, but she started blasting me for taking his phone without her permission and saying that I was too invasive and that she\u2019d never agree to that if she was there and \u201cif Orson wants to say mean stuff in private, that\u2019s not our place to judge\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m still very emotional about this, as my wife has never got mad at me like this.

Now is the time to parent him! You had the right instincts. He is being a shit fuck. Now is the time to have a serious real conversation about why this shit isn\u2019t okay at all. Get orson a flip phone or \u2018dumb\u2019 smart phone so he can contact you in emergencies. \n\nYour wife being realllllly touchy about the phone privacy thing is weird too. What\u2019s on her phone?", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is okay with raising an ableist, homophobic, bigot?? She\u2019s wrong, that is ABSOLUTELY your place as a parent to judge. Saying things like that is not okay in ANY context. \n\nYour son is a child. He needs to be parented, and you were simply parenting. He needs to learn a serious lesson now, before this gets even more out of hand. \n\nSide note: You\u2019re the authority figure. The phone belongs to you (the person who pays for it) and was given to your son. If you ask for it, you take it. You don\u2019t give him a gift (extra Halloween candy) in exchange. Babying him like this is likely what got you into this situation in the first place.", "Lol you bribed your kid with candy to be able to check his phone after he spewed hate speech at his brother? A+ parenting all around. \n\nSo, your kid is a little baby proto-bigot. It happens, but it's good to approach it from that angle. He isn't a perfect innocent little boy who \"learned\" it from older kids, he gravitated towards friends who feel the way he feels about stuff. This is probably not the first time he's thought your christmas-loving eldest son was being a bit \"gay\", its just the first time he felt emboldened enough to say it. \n\nHe's still young and you can probably get him to see how immature his attitude is, but I would strongly recommend therapy and active engagement as a parent over giving him candy to get him to pretty please do what you tell him to do. \n\nAlso, take a hard look at your wife here. Why is she coming at you for trying to figure out your kid's behavioral problems and not absolutely mortified her kid is like this? Is it just that he's her baby boy or is she just kinda cool with bigots?\n\nEta: nta, but seriously why are you rewarding his behavior?", "NTA\n\nYour son is eleven. If he continues with these opinions into actions against other people or property, you and your wife are also legally and civilly responsible for his actions. \n\nThe fact that your wife thinks it's perfectly fine for an 11yo to be expressing these types of opinions privately is disturbing, and says something about her. What types of opinions does she express privately that she does not want judged?", "Bro, I was with you until here:\n\n>I then told him to give me his phone, and he refused until I told him he could have some of our extra Halloween candy if he gave me it.\n\n\nThat's not how a punishment works.  \n\n\nOverall though, NTA.  Your son is learning that vitriol from somewhere.  It's your job as a parent to find out where and stop it.\n\n\nYour wife is also disgusting here.  Yes, people need privacy.  But guess what, his \"mean stuff in private\" became public.  Makes me wonder why she's okay with him spewing that hatred.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour son is 11. It's part of your job as a parent to help him develop positive values and to protect him from malign influences. While ocverall I AM a fan of kids having as much privacy as they reasonably can, but that needs to be balanced against protecting them from influences like the ones in Orson's group chat. You're trying your best in a difficult situation.   \n\n\n\"it's just jokes\" is the gateway to a life as a hateful, misogynistic, homophobic bigot. It is absolutely your job to steer your children away from that path.", "NTA in today age the internet can really influence kids in a bad way so checking to see what he is doing is not bad what worries me is that fact that your wife focus on you doing that instead of her son acting that way like even if she was mad about you doing that the most important thing is that her son is acting this way online and now is starting to show up irl.", "NTA\n\nYour youngest is at a very impressionable age right now and if he plays any online games, that\u2019s more than likely where he\u2019s hearing those terms. It\u2019s great you\u2019re taking action with this instead of brushing it off. He needs to know that language is not okay and that it\u2019s harmful to others. \n\nDefinitely monitor his online use more closely and don\u2019t be afraid to implement child safety mechanisms if needed.", "NTA, you did the right thing here. Now is the time to correct your son\u2019s behavior and find out where the problematic behavior is coming from. Your wife is absolutely in the wrong about \u201cletting him say mean things in private\u201d\u2014he\u2019s young and needs guidance, not a carte blanche to say whatever terrible thing he wants. \n\nGood on you for looking out for your kid!", "NTA. It\u2019s your JOB as a parent to monitor what he\u2019s doing and saying. It\u2019s also your JOB to put a stop to racism/homophobia. And I\u2019m sorry, you bribed him with candy to give you the phone? That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. The phone is a privilege and you as the parent should absolutely TAKE it away with or without their \u201cpermission\u201d. Good lord.", "NTA. It is absolutely not private and it is absolutely your place to judge, as parents. I assume you pay for the phone. He's 11, not 16, his level of privacy and the level of parental screening is very very different from an older child's.\n\nHis comments to his brothers were NOT private. What did she think about that behavior?\n\nThere's some really disgusting AH behavior out there in online pre-teen boy land right now, Andrew Tate-esque stuff that is very, very dangerous. Your wife is being naive about this. My daughters (14 and 16) tell me how bad some of this has gotten amongst the less enlightened boys in their schools. Online bullying is also at an all-time high. Let her read these comments.", "WTF is wrong with your wife??  NTA but yikes.  I'm not sure how you're going to manage to coparent with her.", "NTA but at least you figured out where he learned the bigotry. Sorry about your wife, that is a big oof.", "NTA unless you gave the phone back to the kid. You didn't give it back now that you know what it's used for, right?", "> I asked where he learned that language and he said it didn\u2019t matter. \n\nI have a guess:\n\n>\u201cif Orson wants to say mean stuff in private, that\u2019s not our place to judge\u201d.  She was yelling before she hung up. She almost never raises her voice. \n\n**NTA**, your wife is and I'd be just as concerned if not more so about *her*.", "NTA! Points for trying to be a good dad and raise a respectful son!", "NTA! I had to re-read because I thought it was about the 16 year-old! He's only 11, so correct this behavior while you can. By the time he is 16, you'll have a racist, sexist, ableist mess on your hands if you don't intervene. Control his internet time and install parental controls at least until high school.", "Your wife\u2019s being so upset about looking through his phone instead of the vile hate speech her youngest son is spewing strikes me as really bizarre. \nYou two need to get on the same page", "NTA, but your wife is working up to be one for sure.", "NTA", "NTA. you as a parent are entitled to know what your kids are looking at in their phones until 18. Your wife is in the wrong. you dont need mutual consent to see why your kid is behaving badly. IDK what is going on in the mindset of your wife tbh.", "YTA for taking your son's phone and looking through it. By looking through his phone you have violated your son's human right to privacy and you should be ashamed of yourself. \n\nI understand where you're coming from, and you're absolutely right to correct his use of foul language and discriminatory viewpoints. In the car example you gave, you were absolutely right to call him out on his language. If this is done continually, in addition to having a sit down conversation with your son about his opinions and language, then you could make some good headway into improving his personal development. \n\nHowever, you took his phone and snooped through it. All that did was likely give your son trust issues. He's not going to trust you with the small nor major things in his life when he knows that even one small step out of line will result in you invading his privacy. He may very well be more defensive towards you if/when you ask questions that aren't superficial. At the very least, if you wish to make things somewhat \"right\" with him, you owe him an apology. And you must also pledge to never violate his privacy again. \nI know from experience what it is like having a parent snoop through my phone. It's happened to me more than once. And you know what that resulted in? Nothing good came of it, I assure you.\nI have trust issues, I get defensive when anyone comes close to viewing range of my phone, and I've learned how to hide stuff better. Chances are your son may very well develop some of these if you do not atone for your wrongdoing.\n\nTLDR: You mean well, OP, but you went about it in the wrong way.

She may have felt differently if she heard it.  In my opinion confiscating his phone as a punishment for the way he was talking about his brothers is absolutely within your rights as the parent in charge of the kids at that time.\n\nThe length of the punishment should be decided on by both parents, so it's best not to make long-term pronouncements until you've had a chance to consult. \n\nAs for going through his phone, he basically gave you permission in exchange for candy.  (Which, by the way, shows his level of thinking is not mature.)  Going forward, you should make it clear to ALL of your kids that as long as you are providing the phone and the service, they do NOT have the assurance of privacy. (Or agree with your wife as to the level allowed). At minimum, you can use your service provider to check a list of what numbers he is calling/texting.  You can also limit his connectivity with parental controls.\n\nBut the bottom line is, 30 years ago the same kind of talk in that chat would be going on in the playground.  You can't stop it by taking his phone.  So he needs a talking to about acceptable behavior, respect for others, etc.", "NTA. As a parent it is your job to monitor his activity, in person, online, and even sometimes socially. As you see he exhibits mature and responsible traits, you can monitor less because you are trusting more. In this case, your son clearly needs much more monitoring. But never, should you ever, BRIBE the kid to follow your direct instructions.

We don't need another bigot who thinks that lgbtq people or Nuero divergent people or disabled people are bad and evil. If he's saying it to his friends, these friends need to not be his friends any more and you need to talk to their parents. You need to start monitoring his online life a bit more. And you need to sit your wife down and talk about the road ahead. Does she want him to go up to a girl in high school and go \"don't be a b!tch, just come and fxck me. God you d#ke, I should (insert threat). You gay slur\" and get suspended or expelled? What happens when he pulls this shit in college and you can't protect him?

Uphill battle that must be won or son is going into middle school and will go downhill fast. So yes, unacceptable and deal with these issues fast,  firmly and consistently. \n\nAs for mom, smh.

Calmly ask her why so protective of his phone? Stick to phone issue only (not Orson or what he did), just why so protective. It feels like she\u2019s really being offended by going into A phone. Like she feels violated. Is it her need to protect her own privacy as if she feels threatened her privacy will be violated?? Something isn\u2019t right here.

In addition to dealing with this situation, it'd be a good time to re-establish rules and procedures for both your under 16 kids. You can find developmentally appropriate ideas online, but not having them alone at night and regular checks are popular.\n\nFinally, I would say if you can afford it, work with a therapist on your sons current issues.\n\nGood luck, and good on you for dealing with this.

One is possession of the phone, the other is access to the material inside of it. \n\nI\u2019d be more hesitant about the latter due to privacy. But the right to physical possession of the phone itself belongs to the parents. \n\nI agree that if you\u2019re assuming the latter, you\u2019d have to warn the kid at the outset. But if you\u2019re just taking away physical possession, without reading anything inside of it, I don\u2019t think there needs to be any warning.
