Our appointments were for when they first opened.\r  \n\r  \nFord asked if we could go shopping for Christmas decor, given Halloween is finally over. Ford is one of those people who loves to go all-out for Christmas, it\u2019s his favorite holiday and he always decorates his room full of Christmas stuff. I agreed to it and took the boys to some stores to look for decor. \r  \n\r  \nFord bought quite a bit of stuff, Kian and Orson were also able to buy stuff, I told the boys I\u2019d buy them whatever they wanted. Ford was especially excited about a few baseball related Christmas decor he got (as well as a few non-christmas baseball things), Kian got a few items for his room, like decorative pillows.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue came with Orson. Orson is not into decorating or anything like that, he also has more niche interests (for lack of better word) like animes, science, ect so we normally go to more antique/thrift type stores for him. I had offered to take Orson after this but he said he didn\u2019t want to go.\r  \n\r  \nOnce we got in the car after we were done in the home decor stores, I was going to drive the kids to lunch, but Orson started complaining and saying some really disgusting stuff. He started telling Ford that decorating and design is for \u201cf slurs\u201d (he used the actual slur), he started complaining that this made Ford \u201clook gay\u201d. I told Orson to stop and that this was inappropriate, but he continued to rant on, and started complaining about Ford in general, saying that everything he liked was \u201cre\\*\\*\\*\\*ed\u201d. At this point, I tell the boys we are going home and that we\u2019d go out for lunch later. \r  \n\r  \nWe just got home a bit under an hour ago. I tried talking to Orson, but he refused, saying he did nothing wrong. I asked where he learned that language and he said it didn\u2019t matter. I then told him to give me his phone, and he refused until I told him he could have some of our extra Halloween candy if he gave me it.\r  \n\r  \nI looked through his phone and found absolutely disgusting texts in a group chat that him and about 10 other boys he\u2019s friends with are in: incredibly racist memes, making fun of autism and ADHD, anti-LGBT stuff and more.\r  \n\r  \nI just called my wife trying to tell her that we needed to sit down when she got home to discuss this, but she started blasting me for taking his phone without her permission and saying that I was too invasive and that she\u2019d never agree to that if she was there and \u201cif Orson wants to say mean stuff in private, that\u2019s not our place to judge\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m still very emotional about this, as my wife has never got mad at me like this.

Now is the time to parent him! You had the right instincts. He is being a shit fuck. Now is the time to have a serious real conversation about why this shit isn\u2019t okay at all. Get orson a flip phone or \u2018dumb\u2019 smart phone so he can contact you in emergencies. \n\nYour wife being realllllly touchy about the phone privacy thing is weird too. What\u2019s on her phone?", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is okay with raising an ableist, homophobic, bigot?? She\u2019s wrong, that is ABSOLUTELY your place as a parent to judge. Saying things like that is not okay in ANY context. \n\nYour son is a child. He needs to be parented, and you were simply parenting. He needs to learn a serious lesson now, before this gets even more out of hand. \n\nSide note: You\u2019re the authority figure. The phone belongs to you (the person who pays for it) and was given to your son. If you ask for it, you take it. You don\u2019t give him a gift (extra Halloween candy) in exchange. Babying him like this is likely what got you into this situation in the first place.", "Lol you bribed your kid with candy to be able to check his phone after he spewed hate speech at his brother? A+ parenting all around. \n\nSo, your kid is a little baby proto-bigot. It happens, but it's good to approach it from that angle. He isn't a perfect innocent little boy who \"learned\" it from older kids, he gravitated towards friends who feel the way he feels about stuff. This is probably not the first time he's thought your christmas-loving eldest son was being a bit \"gay\", its just the first time he felt emboldened enough to say it. \n\nHe's still young and you can probably get him to see how immature his attitude is, but I would strongly recommend therapy and active engagement as a parent over giving him candy to get him to pretty please do what you tell him to do. \n\nAlso, take a hard look at your wife here. Why is she coming at you for trying to figure out your kid's behavioral problems and not absolutely mortified her kid is like this? Is it just that he's her baby boy or is she just kinda cool with bigots?\n\nEta: nta, but seriously why are you rewarding his behavior?", "NTA\n\nYour son is eleven. If he continues with these opinions into actions against other people or property, you and your wife are also legally and civilly responsible for his actions. \n\nThe fact that your wife thinks it's perfectly fine for an 11yo to be expressing these types of opinions privately is disturbing, and says something about her. What types of opinions does she express privately that she does not want judged?", "Bro, I was with you until here:\n\n>I then told him to give me his phone, and he refused until I told him he could have some of our extra Halloween candy if he gave me it.\n\n\nThat's not how a punishment works.  \n\n\nOverall though, NTA.  Your son is learning that vitriol from somewhere.  It's your job as a parent to find out where and stop it.\n\n\nYour wife is also disgusting here.  Yes, people need privacy.  But guess what, his \"mean stuff in private\" became public.  Makes me wonder why she's okay with him spewing that hatred.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour son is 11. It's part of your job as a parent to help him develop positive values and to protect him from malign influences. While ocverall I AM a fan of kids having as much privacy as they reasonably can, but that needs to be balanced against protecting them from influences like the ones in Orson's group chat. You're trying your best in a difficult situation.   \n\n\n\"it's just jokes\" is the gateway to a life as a hateful, misogynistic, homophobic bigot. It is absolutely your job to steer your children away from that path.", "NTA in today age the internet can really influence kids in a bad way so checking to see what he is doing is not bad what worries me is that fact that your wife focus on you doing that instead of her son acting that way like even if she was mad about you doing that the most important thing is that her son is acting this way online and now is starting to show up irl.", "NTA\n\nYour youngest is at a very impressionable age right now and if he plays any online games, that\u2019s more than likely where he\u2019s hearing those terms. It\u2019s great you\u2019re taking action with this instead of brushing it off. He needs to know that language is not okay and that it\u2019s harmful to others. \n\nDefinitely monitor his online use more closely and don\u2019t be afraid to implement child safety mechanisms if needed.", "NTA, you did the right thing here. Now is the time to correct your son\u2019s behavior and find out where the problematic behavior is coming from. Your wife is absolutely in the wrong about \u201cletting him say mean things in private\u201d\u2014he\u2019s young and needs guidance, not a carte blanche to say whatever terrible thing he wants. \n\nGood on you for looking out for your kid!", "NTA. It\u2019s your JOB as a parent to monitor what he\u2019s doing and saying. It\u2019s also your JOB to put a stop to racism/homophobia. And I\u2019m sorry, you bribed him with candy to give you the phone? That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. The phone is a privilege and you as the parent should absolutely TAKE it away with or without their \u201cpermission\u201d. Good lord.", "NTA. It is absolutely not private and it is absolutely your place to judge, as parents. I assume you pay for the phone. He's 11, not 16, his level of privacy and the level of parental screening is very very different from an older child's.\n\nHis comments to his brothers were NOT private. What did she think about that behavior?\n\nThere's some really disgusting AH behavior out there in online pre-teen boy land right now, Andrew Tate-esque stuff that is very, very dangerous. Your wife is being naive about this. My daughters (14 and 16) tell me how bad some of this has gotten amongst the less enlightened boys in their schools. Online bullying is also at an all-time high. Let her read these comments.", "WTF is wrong with your wife??  NTA but yikes.  I'm not sure how you're going to manage to coparent with her.", "NTA but at least you figured out where he learned the bigotry. Sorry about your wife, that is a big oof.", "NTA unless you gave the phone back to the kid. You didn't give it back now that you know what it's used for, right?", "> I asked where he learned that language and he said it didn\u2019t matter. \n\nI have a guess:\n\n>\u201cif Orson wants to say mean stuff in private, that\u2019s not our place to judge\u201d.  She was yelling before she hung up. She almost never raises her voice. \n\n**NTA**, your wife is and I'd be just as concerned if not more so about *her*.", "NTA! Points for trying to be a good dad and raise a respectful son!", "NTA! I had to re-read because I thought it was about the 16 year-old! He's only 11, so correct this behavior while you can. By the time he is 16, you'll have a racist, sexist, ableist mess on your hands if you don't intervene. Control his internet time and install parental controls at least until high school.", "Your wife\u2019s being so upset about looking through his phone instead of the vile hate speech her youngest son is spewing strikes me as really bizarre. \nYou two need to get on the same page", "NTA, but your wife is working up to be one for sure.", "NTA", "NTA. you as a parent are entitled to know what your kids are looking at in their phones until 18. Your wife is in the wrong. you dont need mutual consent to see why your kid is behaving badly. IDK what is going on in the mindset of your wife tbh.", "YTA for taking your son's phone and looking through it. By looking through his phone you have violated your son's human right to privacy and you should be ashamed of yourself. \n\nI understand where you're coming from, and you're absolutely right to correct his use of foul language and discriminatory viewpoints. In the car example you gave, you were absolutely right to call him out on his language. If this is done continually, in addition to having a sit down conversation with your son about his opinions and language, then you could make some good headway into improving his personal development. \n\nHowever, you took his phone and snooped through it. All that did was likely give your son trust issues. He's not going to trust you with the small nor major things in his life when he knows that even one small step out of line will result in you invading his privacy. He may very well be more defensive towards you if/when you ask questions that aren't superficial. At the very least, if you wish to make things somewhat \"right\" with him, you owe him an apology. And you must also pledge to never violate his privacy again. \nI know from experience what it is like having a parent snoop through my phone. It's happened to me more than once. And you know what that resulted in? Nothing good came of it, I assure you.\nI have trust issues, I get defensive when anyone comes close to viewing range of my phone, and I've learned how to hide stuff better. Chances are your son may very well develop some of these if you do not atone for your wrongdoing.\n\nTLDR: You mean well, OP, but you went about it in the wrong way.

She may have felt differently if she heard it.  In my opinion confiscating his phone as a punishment for the way he was talking about his brothers is absolutely within your rights as the parent in charge of the kids at that time.\n\nThe length of the punishment should be decided on by both parents, so it's best not to make long-term pronouncements until you've had a chance to consult. \n\nAs for going through his phone, he basically gave you permission in exchange for candy.  (Which, by the way, shows his level of thinking is not mature.)  Going forward, you should make it clear to ALL of your kids that as long as you are providing the phone and the service, they do NOT have the assurance of privacy. (Or agree with your wife as to the level allowed). At minimum, you can use your service provider to check a list of what numbers he is calling/texting.  You can also limit his connectivity with parental controls.\n\nBut the bottom line is, 30 years ago the same kind of talk in that chat would be going on in the playground.  You can't stop it by taking his phone.  So he needs a talking to about acceptable behavior, respect for others, etc.", "NTA. As a parent it is your job to monitor his activity, in person, online, and even sometimes socially.

Are you a car manufacturer?", "One thing I haven't seen in the comments is: why is he HER kid, and why do you need her permission to parent your own kid? Why is she not furious at his attitude & bigotry? Why did you bribe an 11 YEAR OLD with candy to take away his phone? Last I checked, HE didn't buy the phone, nor does he pay the bill. YTA for being so wishy washy about your son's hatred & allowing him to lash out at his own brother, using a slur? Oh, he'd hate it at my home. My oldest once told me \"F#$k you\", and I promptly grabbed her ear, walked her to the bathroom, and washed her mouth out with soap. You wanna cuss at me when you're 18? Ok, you're grown, I can deal. But to cuss me out at 13, cuz you didn't get your way? Not happening. Because I SAID SO. My youngest grandson used the \"That's so gay\" bit when we were in the car. My mom arm reached out before I knew it, and smacked him upside the head. He knew better, & he knew why I did it. I will NOT tolerate any type of slurs used in my presence.

What he  is doing on his phone is not going to help him become a decent respectful caring person. If.. If he was my son. I\u2019d be monitoring that phone and going through it like crazy daily. And taking his phone after 9 pm to charge in my bedroom. \n\nHe is 11, he isn\u2019t mature enough for a free-all of a cell phone. I don\u2019t most 11 year old are. I\u2019m note sure most 16 years are mature enough. Did you know sexting start as early as 10?? And kids are been blackmailed to send out nudes?? No way would I let my kids loose on a cell phone nowadays. \n\nYour wife, she is seeing her babies with rose colored glasses. They are great kids I\u2019m sure. However, keeping them that way takes work.. and keeping a close eye on them. You did good Dad!", "NTA for looking through his phone, it\u2019s a privilege , not a right. Same with internet access, it can and should be monitored for kids. But WTF. Why did it take bribing him for his phone? Should be presented on request.", " \u201cif Orson wants to say mean stuff in private, that\u2019s not our place to judge\u201d.\n\nNTA but your wife thinks you can't judge some Aryan youth groupschat?", ">I told him he could have some of our extra Halloween can\u2019t if he gave it to me.\n\nWow. He\u2019s 11. You\u2019re doing it wrong. You don\u2019t bribe the kid in order to enforce his punishment.\n\nThat said, he\u2019s falling in with a group that\u2019s extremely toxic. And he\u2019s showing clear signs of bullying by the way he treated his brother even after being asked to stop. You should take this quite seriously.\n\nIt kinda feels like 1-2 boys in the group are the instigators - maybe the lead bullies - and the others are just piling on so they look cool to the leader. Kids don\u2019t pick up that attitude in a vacuum, so a couple of the kids likely come from homes that actually think like that.\n\nAlso, you can\u2019t let Orson undermine Ford\u2019s creative spirit - and a few deep insults will may have Ford rethinking if he wants to decorate so much. Maybe go out of your way to make sure you LOVE his creative spirit.\n\nOrson\u2019s behavior has to be stopped in its infancy before it becomes too ingrained in his psych. But your wife needs be on board and part of the solution too. You might want to screen capture some of the messages before returning the phone.\n\nThere\u2019s many ways to handle this. In order of increasing involvement:\n\n1) Sit down with Orson and try to find out where he\u2019s coming from without lecturing him out the wazoo. Ask him if he really believes these things. And why. And then explain how hurtful his words are towards people who are already struggling to be accepted.\n\n2) If that fails, you could try therapy - maybe even family therapy with Orson, OP, and his wife.\n\n3) Contact other parents in the group chat to see if they have any clue. Especially ones you may know. If one does and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s such a big deal, well - that\u2019s the ringleader.\n\n4) Get the school involved and tell them the names of the others in the group chat. They can look out for potential bullying behavior or just see who he hangs out with. The teachers will likely know exactly who the instigator is.\n\nI say this as a father of an adult son who had similar viewpoints as a late teen - likely long before, but he knew we wouldn\u2019t tolerate that kind of speech or thinking. It took jail and later an outstanding therapist to turn himself around. In the process, we learned he\u2019s on the spectrum and a bit dyslexic. He had lots of social issues earlier. In retrospect, I wish we had sought out therapy MUCH earlier. That might be the case here where underlying conditions make him more susceptible to follow these AH kids.", "OP, how much info did u give your wife? Like, did you tell her exactly what he said, or just that you saw some things very vague?", "Wow. Just wow. Your wife\u2026.also, why are you bribing your kid with candy to listen to you? I suggest some parenting classes for both of you. NTA", "NTA.

Please bring your son to heel before he shoots up a school. \n\nAnd not to be a reddit cliche that foretells divorce every other post but seriously, if I were in your shoes, I would be having real questions about the future of my marriage.

Up until I was 18 if my mom told me to give her my phone then I was expected to give it up. No fights. No questions. It rarely happened because she never had a reason but the fact of the matter is, the expectation of having a phone was that it\u2019s a privilege that can be taken away at any time if she thought I was abusing it.

Does she normally minimize and defend extreme bigoted behavior?\n\nYou and she do need to talk: first, about her parenting notions.

It\u2019s entirely inappropriate to let an 11 year old have unrestricted access to the internet and a phone without some supervision. You or your wife should be checking it weekly at least. You\u2019re grown, you know what kind of material is on the internet. I do not understand the logic of parents just giving little kids a smart phone and leaving them to it. \n\nOn top of that you had to bribe him with candy to look at his phone? You are the parent. He is a child. There should be no bribery involved at all when he\u2019s that age. What you say goes. You are literally letting him call the shots here. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that you needed to debate and bribe your 11 year old with sweets so that you could see his phone which you pay for and he\u2019s too young to have unsupervised (or at all) anyway. \n\nStart putting boundaries in asap. Stop letting your 11 year old dictate. Start regularly checking his phone whether he likes it or not. And if he continues this behaviour take it away completely. \n\nYour wife is a whole other issue.
