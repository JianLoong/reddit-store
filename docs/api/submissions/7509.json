{"id": 7509, "submission_id": "10dr5wb", "title": "AITA For making a scene and kicking my cousin out of a baby shower", "selftext": "My wife (28F) is pregnant with our first child.  She is about 5-months along and I (29M) am very excited to be a father.  This past weekend we had a baby shower at our house.  We invited both sides of our family rather than try to do 2 separate showers.  I have a cousin, Sue (22F), who I wasn't going to invite because she's very open about being childfree to the point, in my opinion, of being anti-natalist.  She's said some very out-there things in the past about these topics and I figured she wouldn't want to come even if we invited her.  But after getting pressure from both my mom and Sue's mom about not leaving her out, I reluctantly sent Sue an invite and to my surprise, she accepted. \n\nFor the most part things went well at the shower.  But when my wife started opening presents, Sue kept making comments.  First it was about how much waste diapers create and how wasteful baby clothes are because they outgrow them so fast.  Then it was about how so many baby and kids toys are made overseas where workers are taken advantage of.  Then, when my mom told us that they had already set up a college fund for our child, Sue made a comment about how parents shouldn't force their kids out of the house at 18 and how if people had to support their kids all through life, maybe less people would have kids.\n\nIt was at this point that I pulled Sue aside and talked to her in another room.  I told her that if she hates the idea of kids so much, then she might as well just leave.  She said she was just stating facts and that the truth can never be controversial.  I told her that in that case, I have a hard truth for her.  I told her that I the only reason I invited her is because her mom practically begged me too and I don't want her in our house and that she is no longer welcome, so she should leave.  \n\nI must have raised my voice louder than I thought, because my mom and Sue's mom came into the room and asked what was going on.  Sue said that I am kicking her out because she's childfree.  I told her I'm kicking her out because she's being an asshole on a day that is supposed to be about celebrating my wife's pregnancy and all Sue is doing is making it about her BS beliefs.    \n\nMy mom and Sue's mom tried to calm things down, but I insisted that Sue leave right then and there or I would be forced to call the police because she's currently trespassing.  Sue grabbed her things and stormed out and my mom and Sue's mom got mad at me.\n\nThey told me that Sue was just stating her opinion and that some of the things she said are true.  I told them that there's a time and a place for that kind of conversation and a baby shower sure as hell isn't it.  I told them this is exactly why I didn't want to invite Sue in the first place and as far as I'm concerned, they are just as much to blame as Sue is.\n\nLiterally no one is happy and the whole baby shower became about something else instead of focusing on my wife and our coming baby.", "created_utc": 1673901913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dr5wb/aita_for_making_a_scene_and_kicking_my_cousin_out/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course, she made a scene and I had to kick her out.  I also placed some of the blame on my mom and aunt who convinced me to invite her.  Now everyone is pissed about how things went down.

No? *Then she understands there is a time and a place.*", "NTA, she has to know what she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s trying to undermine your wife and make her feel bad for having the baby she wants which is not on.

Everything she said wasn\u2019t even the whole truth.", "While you weren't exactly nice to Sue, she *absolutely* deserved it in this instance.  She was 100% making this about her and how she thought babies were a waste.  \n\nSeriously, the moms are also AHs here...

Your mom and Sue\u2019s mom are assholes for defending her. Since they insisted on inviting her they should\u2019ve dealt with her and been the one to pull her aside.

BTW, congrats on your new addition!", "NTA. I have no desire to have children and think people who do are absolutely insane, however, that's their choice and when people are truly happy to have a child, my opinion is invalid. To make such comments during a special moment in yours and your wife's life is so rude, if I was there, I'd have kicked her out myself and I agree with most of what she said. \n\nShe ruined your day by being an asshole.", "NTA and I'm sorry the shower ended the way it did. Sue sounds like an obnoxious, socially incompetent nightmare.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your wife.

If more people had kicked Sue out, she might have better public manners.", "NTA.   \n\n\nI... Jesus your whole family, OP!

Stick to your guns and don't let her back into the fold once the kid is born unless she's matured.", "NTA While she's not wrong with the things she said, there absolutely is a time and place and also how something is said. If I were to just hang out with friends and discuss how a plant based diet is better because of certain health reasons, how animals are treated, etc. that would be fine. If I was invited to a BBQ and started lecturing everyone on how these animals they are currently eating were pumped full of antibiotics, how they often have cancer, absesses or parasites that are just cut away, how halal animals have their throat slit and are left to bleed out upside down, etc. I would be a massive asshole. I would be ruining everyones mood and appetite and for what? And your cousin was doing exactly this except the baby shower equivalent and that makes her an AH.", "NTA. She was going out of her way to be obnoxious.", "NTA \n\nYou put up with a lot before you pulled her aside. Sue may as well have creates protest signs on sticks and marched around the house. She was way out of line and also out of control.\n\nShame on both your mother and her mother for pressuring you before and their behavior during. The all ruined what should have been a joyful day.", "NTA. Time and a place. I hate it when the peanut gallery shows up and makes offhand rude remarks and state them as \\*truths\\*. Just because they are \\*true\\* doesn't make it appropriate to be spoken in certain circumstances. It wasn't her place to be giving her opinion out like that. Also, your mom and her mom are assholes for forcing you to invite her when you knew she would be an issue.\n\nIt's like when someone tries to force their religion on you in your own home. Heck no, get out of here.", "NTA but you probably should have kicked her out when she first started making the comments or have just stood your ground and not invited her.", "NTA\n\nSome people are unbearable as a hobby.", "NTA - They asked you to do something that you didn't think was a good idea, and you did it.

You shouldn\u2019t have been guilted into invited someone that you didn\u2019t want there. She didn\u2019t need to make the shower about her - she doesn\u2019t have to want children to celebrate an event that her family member is happy about. It sounds like you attempted to address it quietly but weren\u2019t able to because someone simply wanted to create drama\n\nLesson to learn from this event: don\u2019t let your mother and mother in law dictate who you invite to your celebrations anymore.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like a pain and your mom and aunt are idiots for thinking her presence would be a good idea. The statement \"the truth is never controversial\" is the most asinine thing I've heard in a long time.  \n\nDon't just kick your cousin out of the baby shower, kick her out of your life. Be sure to keep her far from your kid so she doesn't express how much of a mistake having a child is to the kid themselves.\n\nPeople like this are pathetic. It's fine to be child free but to purposely and vindictively try to ruin someone else's BABY SHOWER bc of your personal beliefs is immature at best and cruel at worst.", "NTA.

Your mom and aunt owe you an apology. I\u2019m so sorry that you had to put your foot down, but please keep the positive things in the forefront of your mind. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin the party. You gave Sue yet another chance at your mother and aunt\u2019s requests. At least you now know you were definitely correct in predicting her behavior and you\u2019ll be able to say no if they ever insist again.", "NTA\n\n> I told them this is exactly why I didn't want to invite Sue in the first place and as far as I'm concerned, they are just as much to blame as Sue is.\n\nYep, you should indeed have refused to invite her in the first place.  \n\nI have no idea why family members insist that x person or y person should be invited just because they are a relative.\n\nAs I often say on this subreddit, toxic people are not entitled to be a part of your life just because of their relationship to you.", "NTA\nOh gosh that is such a hard one. I think you clearly saw that Sue is very immature and while she may believe that there is nothing wrong with speaking \u201cthe truth\u201d (aka her truth), the fact of the matter is that a baby shower is not the place for her critical and cynical opinions.  Her mother is doing her daughter a disservice by not educating her on how to behave when you are an invited guest and are celebrating a joyous event.  I also think that you contributed to the blowup by giving in to your anger. You could have set some firm boundaries with her and expectations before the baby shower so it wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when you ask her to leave due to her inappropriate behavior.  Hopefully sue will one day mature, but until then setting firm boundaries with her is the way to go.", "NTA. Congratulations to Sue and the moms on their not-baby shower! They effectively made the event entirely about Sue. Your poor wife. Sue sounds like a child. \n\nYou have my sympathy. Good on you for going so far to protect your wife and her special day. I'm so sorry it was ruined. Congratulations to you on your baby!", "NTA Your home, your celebration. They should not have talked you into inviting her in the first place.", "Show Sue one of the Debbie Downer sketches from SNL.

Why did she even show up but to cause a scene. She got what she wanted.", "I've found that a really great strategy for determining whether or not to say a hard truth is to ask yourself the following questions: \n\n1. Is it true?\n2. Is it kind?\n3. Is it necessary?\n\nIf the \"hard truth\" doesn't meet at least two of the above criteria, then it shouldn't be stated.  NTA because Sue knew exactly what she was doing. She had a goal to disrupt the party in order to promote her childfree agenda, and didn't care that her statements weren't kind or necessary.", "NTA but threatening to call the cops is a bit much.", "NTA. Shouldn\u2019t have called her beliefs BS, but anyone who\u2019s been invited to a party to celebrate someone else and then goes out of their way to antagonise shouldn\u2019t be at the party. \n\nSue is young and immature and it\u2019s not your job to tolerate her antagonism.", "NTA\nThere's telling the truth, and then there's being a jerk. Sue is old enough to know not to spend a baby shower complaining about babies.", "What really annoys me about militant \"childfree\" individuals is that they think no one should have children and try to make everyone around them miserable if they don't agree with them.   \n\nIf they live in the US,  who do they think will be paying for their social security when they get older?  Who will be their nurses and caregivers if they become infirmed?   \n\nIt's OK to not want children but it's not OK to expect everyone to agree with that stance. We need to respect other's opinions,  even if we disagree.", "NTA.  You lost when you called her beliefs BS.  They are facts.  That doesn\u2019t make her any less of an A for saying it.  What you should have said was that you don\u2019t appreciate her negative attitude about everything as this is a celebration.

Great that you pulled her to the side. You didn't have to go hostile despite your history with your cousin. Like you said, it's about your wife and your baby. Your reaction became the center focus when you could have easily talked to your cousin at least in this manner: \"Hey Sue, I'm glad you're here and I know you have your beliefs about having a child which your entitled to, but could you refrain from making your \"facts\" on my wife's day? This isn't the time or place to be making these comments and I would greatly appreciate if you can hold them in just for this day.\" \n\nBut you straight up told her to leave and you'll call the cops. yikes.", "NTA. Your cousin is right. But nobody asked her opinion so she should have shut up.
