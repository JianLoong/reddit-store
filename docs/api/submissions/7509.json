{"id": 7509, "submission_id": "10dr5wb", "title": "AITA For making a scene and kicking my cousin out of a baby shower", "selftext": "My wife (28F) is pregnant with our first child.  She is about 5-months along and I (29M) am very excited to be a father.  This past weekend we had a baby shower at our house.  We invited both sides of our family rather than try to do 2 separate showers.  I have a cousin, Sue (22F), who I wasn't going to invite because she's very open about being childfree to the point, in my opinion, of being anti-natalist.  She's said some very out-there things in the past about these topics and I figured she wouldn't want to come even if we invited her.  But after getting pressure from both my mom and Sue's mom about not leaving her out, I reluctantly sent Sue an invite and to my surprise, she accepted. \n\nFor the most part things went well at the shower.  But when my wife started opening presents, Sue kept making comments.  First it was about how much waste diapers create and how wasteful baby clothes are because they outgrow them so fast.  Then it was about how so many baby and kids toys are made overseas where workers are taken advantage of.  Then, when my mom told us that they had already set up a college fund for our child, Sue made a comment about how parents shouldn't force their kids out of the house at 18 and how if people had to support their kids all through life, maybe less people would have kids.\n\nIt was at this point that I pulled Sue aside and talked to her in another room.  I told her that if she hates the idea of kids so much, then she might as well just leave.  She said she was just stating facts and that the truth can never be controversial.  I told her that in that case, I have a hard truth for her.  I told her that I the only reason I invited her is because her mom practically begged me too and I don't want her in our house and that she is no longer welcome, so she should leave.  \n\nI must have raised my voice louder than I thought, because my mom and Sue's mom came into the room and asked what was going on.  Sue said that I am kicking her out because she's childfree.  I told her I'm kicking her out because she's being an asshole on a day that is supposed to be about celebrating my wife's pregnancy and all Sue is doing is making it about her BS beliefs.    \n\nMy mom and Sue's mom tried to calm things down, but I insisted that Sue leave right then and there or I would be forced to call the police because she's currently trespassing.  Sue grabbed her things and stormed out and my mom and Sue's mom got mad at me.\n\nThey told me that Sue was just stating her opinion and that some of the things she said are true.  I told them that there's a time and a place for that kind of conversation and a baby shower sure as hell isn't it.  I told them this is exactly why I didn't want to invite Sue in the first place and as far as I'm concerned, they are just as much to blame as Sue is.\n\nLiterally no one is happy and the whole baby shower became about something else instead of focusing on my wife and our coming baby.", "created_utc": 1673901913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dr5wb/aita_for_making_a_scene_and_kicking_my_cousin_out/", "score": 591, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No? *Then she understands there is a time and a place.*", "NTA, she has to know what she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s trying to undermine your wife and make her feel bad for having the baby she wants which is not on.

If I was invited to a BBQ and started lecturing everyone on how these animals they are currently eating were pumped full of antibiotics, how they often have cancer, absesses or parasites that are just cut away, how halal animals have their throat slit and are left to bleed out upside down, etc. I would be a massive asshole.

Just because they are \\*true\\* doesn't make it appropriate to be spoken in certain circumstances. It wasn't her place to be giving her opinion out like that. Also, your mom and her mom are assholes for forcing you to invite her when you knew she would be an issue.\n\nIt's like when someone tries to force their religion on you in your own home.

I think you clearly saw that Sue is very immature and while she may believe that there is nothing wrong with speaking \u201cthe truth\u201d (aka her truth), the fact of the matter is that a baby shower is not the place for her critical and cynical opinions.  Her mother is doing her daughter a disservice by not educating her on how to behave when you are an invited guest and are celebrating a joyous event.  I also think that you contributed to the blowup by giving in to your anger. You could have set some firm boundaries with her and expectations before the baby shower so it wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when you ask her to leave due to her inappropriate behavior.  Hopefully sue will one day mature, but until then setting firm boundaries with her is the way to go.", "NTA. Congratulations to Sue and the moms on their not-baby shower!

Is it kind?\n3. Is it necessary?\n\nIf the \"hard truth\" doesn't meet at least two of the above criteria, then it shouldn't be stated.  NTA because Sue knew exactly what she was doing.

Shouldn\u2019t have called her beliefs BS, but anyone who\u2019s been invited to a party to celebrate someone else and then goes out of their way to antagonise shouldn\u2019t be at the party. \n\nSue is young and immature and it\u2019s not your job to tolerate her antagonism.", "NTA\nThere's telling the truth, and then there's being a jerk. Sue is old enough to know not to spend a baby shower complaining about babies.", "What really annoys me about militant \"childfree\" individuals is that they think no one should have children and try to make everyone around them miserable if they don't agree with them.   \n\nIf they live in the US,  who do they think will be paying for their social security when they get older?  Who will be their nurses and caregivers if they become infirmed?   \n\nIt's OK to not want children but it's not OK to expect everyone to agree with that stance.

This isn't the time or place to be making these comments and I would greatly appreciate if you can hold them in just for this day.\" \n\nBut you straight up told her to leave and you'll call the cops. yikes.", "NTA.

Does she refuse to use plastic, or anything non biodegradable? If not, then she's being a hypocrite.\n\nYes, baby stuff such as toys and clothes are often made overseas by exploited people. It's an unfortunate fact. But it's also true that a majority of the stuff that we use in modern society is. It's something that needs to change, but it's not a flaw with baby stuff in particular. Does she track every single product she buys to make sure it is sourced ethically? If not, she's being even more of a hypocrite.\n\nAlso, have you ever indicated that you would just shove your kids out of the house at 18? Seems like a really random comment to make.\n\nFinally, I would like to leave off on just one observation.

You\u2019re right, she clearly didn\u2019t want to be there so she needed to leave. Not wanting children doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t support those who do. My SIL feels strongly that she doesn\u2019t want any, but she\u2019s a fantastic aunt and cried in excitement when I told her I was pregnant. Just like I have no interest in being a doctor but couldn\u2019t have been happier when my friend finally finished med school.", "Nta. And I am also CF. Sue should have just said no to the invite. I strongly dislike baby showers to begin with, and while I would have been able to shut my pie hole about all her \"truths\" (some are just stupid, but she is right about a few) it just is rarely an enjoyable event for people like me, who don't want, or particularly like kids.

There is a difference between choosing to be child-free and just choosing to hate children.  Your cousin is the latter... but she doesn't have a free reign to inflict that hatred on other people who don't see things her way.

It\u2019s an *invitation,* not a fucking summons.**\n\n> Literally no one is happy and the whole baby shower became about something else instead of focusing on my wife and our coming baby.\n\nAaaaand that\u2019s why you don\u2019t cave to family pressure to invite the arsehole who thinks being child free is a whole fucking personality in the first place.

This is precisely why cousin accepted the invite.  I bet she was giddy in anticipation of having a hostage audience she could preach her personal views to.  OP was right to boot her but he and his wife need to learn not to be guilted into things they know will backfire. Boundaries are essential, especially with a LO on the way.

Baby clothes they'll wear for a couple months aren't any more of a waste than clothes you only wear on a specific day, a specific time of year, or a couple times before it goes out of style. Come on! She doesn't wear ANYTHING that didn't come from a second hand store? Doubtful. She's just looking for ways to hate on people cuter than she is. My goodness. It is possible to not want kids without having to vehemently despise everything around them AND spew that hate at a BABY SHOWER. Seriously, everybody already agrees that child free is the best answer for you, you can quit now. Sorry, NTA. I respect the decision to remain child free and everybody has the right to their opinion, but nobody has the right to push those opinions or take over somebody else's event to discuss them. It's not \"sharing\" if the other person declines it, at that point it's forcing and that's almost never okay. She wasn't saving anybody so her forcing her opinion on others, not okay.", "NTA.
