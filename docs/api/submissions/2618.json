This fianc\u00e9 cheated on me with my best friend, lied about it and the entire school knew about it before I did. This was one of the darkest moments of my life and, while I'm now cordial with her, I still don't like\u00a0my\u00a0ex. I noticed that the reason it appeared on my feed is my mom reacted to it and, upon looking at my ex's posts I saw my Mom comments really flattering things to her constantly - for example:  \n\n\n* *You look dazzling!! You could be a model !!!*\n* *I wish I could hold you in my arms and tell you how much I wish I could take away your pain. I am thinking if you and I send you all my love.* \n* *You are incredible, so smart, gorgeous and resilient*  \n\n\nI have asked my mom not to keep in contact with my exes before, especially this one, because she initially \"both sides\" our breakup\u00a0 (and every breakup I've had) and, frankly, it continues to make me feel like she never has my back. She said she would stop but clearly didn't.\n\nSo when I saw this I called her, pretty emotional, angry and upset. Long story short she:\n\n* Explained the reason she kept contacting my ex is because she did see \"both sides\" to our breakup.\n* Lied about the frequency/recency of engaging with my ex.\n* Downplayed her comments on my exs public page and framed the conversation as me over-reacting.\n* Declined to say that she would stop (\"I need to think about it) and instead pressured me to tell her whether or not to cancel her tickets for the holidays so she could still save some of her money and end the conversation.\n* Every time I tried to ask her to respect the boundary of leaving my exes alone and not disparaging\u00a0me to my girlfriends behind my back tried to make a transaction where I curbed vague behaviors as well. Saying our \"relationship was a two way street\".\n\nThe conversation ended with her just crying so her husband came to pick up the phone. He then texted and called me again to decide whether they should cancel their tickets to visit. I told him in the moment that my conversation with my mom wasn't about whether they'd visit - she's trying to turn it into that. So he said he'd try to work things out with her.\n\nMy GF (33/F) and I had a long talk after. She told me that roughly a year ago my mother disparaged\u00a0me for being too much like my father to her again in private. This is another thing I've repeatedly asked my mom not to do, so hearing that she did it again recently also has made me very upset.----\n\nI know it's silly to uninvite her for commenting on my exes social media - but the constant sense I get from that action (that she resents me no matter what, doesn't empathize with what I went through emotionally and doesn't respect me) make me feel like I'm disrespecting myself by treating her as a guest in my space.

Not to mention that is very insulting to both you and your current girlfriend. \n\nIt's completely insane of her to \"see both sides\" of her situation. Cheating while you are in jail (for her mistake) is one thing, but doing it with your best friend and everyone knowing / keeping it a secret from you is even worse. The fact your mom is even trying to justify it is honestly batshit. \n\nWhen they cancel their ticket, urge them to try for the full refund and not some flight credit, because they won't be needing to worry about visiting you and your gf anymore.", "NTA. Your mother chooses other people's comfort over that of her own child time and time again and now she's upset about being called out on her bullshit. \n\nYou don't have to be in the company of people who don't like you, no matter who they are. Putting your mom in time out will be good for you.", "NTA. Wow. It sounds like you're being punished for whatever your dad did. Maybe you look a lot like him or have some of his mannerisms.

So much of what she is saying and doing is just the exact opposite of what a loving parent would do.\n\nThere is also a trap here. Why did she jump to should she cancle tickets? That's an extreme reaction. Don't get me wrong, it's the preferred scenario, but still. She is going to use this as a way to say how horrible you and your current GF are. She will be the victim. \n\nPersonally I think your better off with less of her in your life.

This rule applies to one\u2019s that fucked me over, not amicable splits.", "NTA\n\nHow does a mother see \u201cboth sides\u201d when your ex cheated on you with your bf\u2026.", "NTA. The way your mom and her husband reacted by making the issue about the upcoming visit makes me think they never wanted to visit at all and that they\u2019d rather have their money back than visit, even aside from this issue existing. Also, is there something you\u2019re not telling about your relationship with your ex? If not, there\u2019s no \u201cboth sides\u201d crap. Your ex cheating on you and embarrassing you is literally not a \u201ctwo way street.\u201d I\u2019m sorry to say that it sounds like your mom doesn\u2019t even like you, let alone love you, and while I think this advice is way overused on Reddit, I would go low or no contact with this woman.", "nta", "NTA. Protect yourself however you need to. Your mom is playing games.", "NTA. No, it\u2019s not silly.", "NTA OP", "Moving on from being hurt doesn't mean loving the person who hurt you. My sister has moved on from an abusive ex; the fact that she never wants to see him again doesn't mean she's not over him, and none of her family would dream of saying nice things to the guy because if she's over it, she shouldn't care! If you love someone, you don't want to be friendly with people who proactively hurt them with no excuse.", "From your Mom's perspective, what exactly is your ex's \"side\" to the breakup? What reason could she have that your Mom is satisfied with, for cheating on you, lying to you, and with your erstwhile best friend, no less?\n\nI'm just curious what bizarre justification she tells herself to make this behavior 'normal.'", "Oh, *what*? She didn\u2019t even raise you?\n\nYeah, uninvite her. Unfollow her. Unfriend her, even.\n\nIt might take a long long time for you to articulate the way she hurts you, but the important thing is just you admit she does and start shielding yourself.\n\nShe has made it very clear that she doesn\u2019t care about your feelings. Take a few years off.\ufffc After that, maybe you go low contact, or maybe you just write her a letter telling her why you don\u2019t want to resume a relationship with her.\ufffc\n\nNTA", "Moving on from being hurt doesn't mean loving the person who hurt you.

If you love someone, you don't want to be friendly with people who proactively hurt them with no excuse. Your mom has made it clear whom she values - don't feel obligated to suck it up and act like she hasn't done that. If you're of little value you to her, she has no reason to make you invite her somewhere unless it's a power play.\n\nNTA She can have Thanksgiving with your ex.", "OP, NTA and I'd cancel the visit for now. Give yourself more time in therapy and self-care? Also, you'll likely find great support and resources over at r/raisedbynarcissists or r/raisedbyborderlines? I'm not trying to diagnose your parent, BUT some of the behavior sounds very familiar to my own toxic family of origin. Good luck!", "Probably aging myself, but description sounds a bit like Guided by Voices.     \n\nThey\u2019re lofi legends in the US\u2026.", "NTA. This actually isn\u2019t silly at all. You and you ex didn\u2019t just break up, she *cheated on you!*\n\nYou\u2019re very mature, and not trying to make her curb her conversations with your exes earlier. And allowing her to maintain contact and you simply not engaging, however, her actions seem to be crossing the line. And projecting a whollllle lot.\n\nINFO: did your father cheat on your mom? did she ever assert that he did? Or did she ever insinuate that that was the reason for their split?", "NTA\n\nOh dear , I feel so sorry for you. I also read your comments and it makes matters worse.\n\nHave you ever considered going LC or NC? I'm usually not one to suggest it without knowing more details, but your story is full of crossed boundaries, backstabbing and emotional abuse.", "It's not silly and you're not overreacting. You don't owe your abuser a welcome into your home. Or to stay in contact. She can see the consequences of her actions, even if i don't think she'd understand. NTA. I'm sorry, she sounds terrible.", "NTA\n\nMy guess?  your mom really wanted a daughter and has low key been prioritizing the women in your life over you for a long long time.  She got close to your ex fianc\u00e9e and finally had the daughter of her dreams and can\u2019t let go.  So she ignores your feelings and minimizes how your ex hurt you so she can keep her fantasy alive of having the daughter she always wanted.  \n\nI\u2019m really sorry OP. Your mom is being pretty awful and you deserve better.", "NTA. Take her up on the suggestion. Don\u2019t have her for the holidays.  Give yourself a break.", "NTA\n\nFrom the outside looking in, your mother maintaining that sort of relationship with a women who cheated on you seems extremely weird. Like not everything needs to have \"two sides\".", "NTA if you don\u2019t want to see her just tell her that. Straight up no chaser. It\u2019s ok to have wants and desires.", "NTA. What the hell did I just read??? I would be doing my best not to throttle someone who cheated on my kid.\n\nIt honestly sounds like she's trying to win the approval of these younger women, which is weird and pathetic. You absolutely don't need this shit in your life.", "NTA. Your mom thinks you're your dad and is trying to \"save\" these women from you.", "NTA.  This isn't about social media comments, it's about asking her to stop doing something that deliberately upsets you. Tell them to cancel, you need some space.  She needs to re-assess if she can be respectful.   If she can't, that might mean NC.", "NTA You are not uninviting her, but maybe you should. This is not about her commenting on your ex's post, but about her continuous disrespect for you, your boundaries and for invalidating your feelings. That is a big deal. Consider limiting contact with someone who has no respect for you.", "NTA\n\nMy dad did the same sort of thing, before social media.  He'd go over to my exes (when he came into town), after we had broken up (even the abusive one), to make sure they were OK...really it was so he could be seen as the 'good guy' and have them like him or something. UGH\n\nI have been no contact and low contact with my Dad for about 15 years.  I do SO MUCH BETTER with no contact, where I am currently.\n\nNarcissistic people behave weird.", "My ex and I would fight frequently, we had one of those toxic passionate relationships with high highs and low lows. I was not the ideal partner by any means, and we abused each other (lying, break ups/getting back together, invasion of privacy, lack of boundaries, etc) - which is a large reason why I forgave her last time we spoke and am cordial with her.\n\nTwo or so years ago my exes second fianc\u00e9 passed away. This was the last time we spoke and I offered my forgiveness. She flirted with the idea of coming out to my state but I gently declined because any mixture between us isn't a good idea and she has a more robust support network than I do, so I was sure she'd be fine.\n\nSo I can understand my mother not *hating* my ex. However, my ex is an attractive woman with a healthy family dynamic and that comes with a lot of built in praise and support from many directions. I don't see the need for my mom to get involved. It's on me and should be my journey to \"both sides\" my past relationships is my initial thinking here.\n\nI wasn't trying to hide this context there's just a character limit on posts in this sub.", "My father is gay and they both have told me that my mother cheated on my father with multiple men.\n\nMy mother asserts my father cheated on her with other men, he says he did not.\n\nI don't really care. In my mind they divorced because he's gay and it is what it is.", "Oh no 100%! I just now think it\u2019s pretty clear why she wants your ex to have a redemption ark. She\u2019s mini her. She deserves forgiveness, because if not, why would you mom? She\u2019s a strong, resilient, angel honey sweetheart because if not, your mom isn\u2019t. She needs therapy. \n\nHowever you don\u2019t have to deal with her projection and cruelty just by virtue of her being mom. You\u2019re not your dad and her unfair punishment for being similar to someone you\u2019re literally biologically related to is deranged.", "My ex and I didn't have a healthy relationship (frequent fights, lying, lack of boundaries, etc). Surprise surprise, my childhood didn't exactly lend me to facilitating a healthy long-term relationship but, since we're both conventionally attractive, we didn't spend much time alone as young adults and were used to getting our way in relationships. \n\nSo when my mother accuses me of incorporating some of the less savory aspects of my father when I was younger, she's not objectively wrong. \n\nI've done alot of work since then to change but it never seems to matter since right up until last year my mother was saying I'm too much like my father. I can't help it at some point, I like some of the aspects of my father sans the controlling aspect.", "Keep up the good work, op \ud83d\udc9c hoping for brighter days for you", "Op I highly recommend you go low contact with your mom at least for now.  She is toxic and is cruel towards you", "Jesus christ you hit the nail on the head.\n\nThank you so much.", "Hm. Well, fair enough. It's completely crazy, though - so I hope you see that aspect of it. Your shortcomings don't excuse your girlfriend's in any meaningful way and she always had the option to leave - she chose not to and to lie and cheat. If you're both in the wrong to some degree, then choosing to diminish your ex's responsibility and putting her on equal footing to her own son is *very* strange and you are right to draw a line over this.", "Thanks.\n\nYea, I mean even my ex doesn't put her responsibility for what happened as equal to mine but, of course, this really isn't about us. At this point our relationship died over a decade ago when we were very young.  \n\n\nIt's about my mother, who wants to come visit for 6 days when the original invitation was for 3-4 and acts like this."]}
