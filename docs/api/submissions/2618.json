This fianc\u00e9 cheated on me with my best friend, lied about it and the entire school knew about it before I did. This was one of the darkest moments of my life and, while I'm now cordial with her, I still don't like\u00a0my\u00a0ex. I noticed that the reason it appeared on my feed is my mom reacted to it and, upon looking at my ex's posts I saw my Mom comments really flattering things to her constantly - for example:  \n\n\n* *You look dazzling!! You could be a model !!!*\n* *I wish I could hold you in my arms and tell you how much I wish I could take away your pain. I am thinking if you and I send you all my love.* \n* *You are incredible, so smart, gorgeous and resilient*  \n\n\nI have asked my mom not to keep in contact with my exes before, especially this one, because she initially \"both sides\" our breakup\u00a0 (and every breakup I've had) and, frankly, it continues to make me feel like she never has my back. She said she would stop but clearly didn't.\n\nSo when I saw this I called her, pretty emotional, angry and upset. Long story short she:\n\n* Explained the reason she kept contacting my ex is because she did see \"both sides\" to our breakup.\n* Lied about the frequency/recency of engaging with my ex.\n* Downplayed her comments on my exs public page and framed the conversation as me over-reacting.\n* Declined to say that she would stop (\"I need to think about it) and instead pressured me to tell her whether or not to cancel her tickets for the holidays so she could still save some of her money and end the conversation.\n* Every time I tried to ask her to respect the boundary of leaving my exes alone and not disparaging\u00a0me to my girlfriends behind my back tried to make a transaction where I curbed vague behaviors as well. Saying our \"relationship was a two way street\".\n\nThe conversation ended with her just crying so her husband came to pick up the phone. He then texted and called me again to decide whether they should cancel their tickets to visit. I told him in the moment that my conversation with my mom wasn't about whether they'd visit - she's trying to turn it into that. So he said he'd try to work things out with her.\n\nMy GF (33/F) and I had a long talk after. She told me that roughly a year ago my mother disparaged\u00a0me for being too much like my father to her again in private. This is another thing I've repeatedly asked my mom not to do, so hearing that she did it again recently also has made me very upset.----\n\nI know it's silly to uninvite her for commenting on my exes social media - but the constant sense I get from that action (that she resents me no matter what, doesn't empathize with what I went through emotionally and doesn't respect me) make me feel like I'm disrespecting myself by treating her as a guest in my space. I just can't tell if I'm over-reacting.\n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1668748788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yybya6/wibta_for_uninviting_my_mother_for_staying_in/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is putting people who have hurt you before you.   Set boundaries, enforce those boundaries.   If that means your mother exits your life because she cannot respect your boundaries, that's her choice.  In the short term, tell her to cancel her tickets.", "NTA- I would flat out tell my mother that her constant over the top kind words to someone who hurt me so deeply is pouring salt in wounds that are unnecessary. Is she trying to remind you of the heartache you experienced? And what about the disrespect to your current gf.

She was showering her with excessive praise. The whole thinks just rubs me the wrong way. It\u2019s just\u2026. weird. \n\nI think I would feel the same as you. It\u2019s just all too much. Your Mom is too much. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nThis story sounds very similar to other experiences over at r/raisedbynarcissists. You may be able to find some comfort and resources about going no/low contact with her...\n\nI don't think I have any lasting thoughts about any of my exes, but if I saw comments from my parents on their social media in general, let alone to the level you have described, I would also be incredibly uncomfortable and weirded out. Not to mention that is very insulting to both you and your current girlfriend. \n\nIt's completely insane of her to \"see both sides\" of her situation. Cheating while you are in jail (for her mistake) is one thing, but doing it with your best friend and everyone knowing / keeping it a secret from you is even worse. The fact your mom is even trying to justify it is honestly batshit. \n\nWhen they cancel their ticket, urge them to try for the full refund and not some flight credit, because they won't be needing to worry about visiting you and your gf anymore.", "NTA. Your mother chooses other people's comfort over that of her own child time and time again and now she's upset about being called out on her bullshit. \n\nYou don't have to be in the company of people who don't like you, no matter who they are. Putting your mom in time out will be good for you.", "NTA. Wow. It sounds like you're being punished for whatever your dad did. Maybe you look a lot like him or have some of his mannerisms. She's got the idea that you're just like him, so your exes must all be like her. I doubt agree has put that much thought into why she does it, and if she did, she might see how ridiculous she's being. Sorry!", "NTA", "Nta..it's weird what she is doing.", "nta", "NTA\n\nShe chose your cheating ex over you and yoir gf.", "NTA. Cut her off altogether, you will be happier.", "Nta - it\u2019s not one thing but the straw that broke the camels back. She has repeatedly said and behaved like you were not her priority. She deserves the same.", "As a parent I can't imagine a situation where I would try to see both sides of someone cheeting in my child,much less find something nice to say to them. \n\nI have a feeling there is something off with your mother when it comes to you. So much of what she is saying and doing is just the exact opposite of what a loving parent would do.\n\nThere is also a trap here. Why did she jump to should she cancle tickets? That's an extreme reaction. Don't get me wrong, it's the preferred scenario, but still. She is going to use this as a way to say how horrible you and your current GF are. She will be the victim. \n\nPersonally I think your better off with less of her in your life. But I'm also petty and would ask why she can see both sides to someone cheeting, is that because she is OK with that type of behavior, or maybe she sees herself in your ex. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is not healthy at all for you as you will never be good enough for her and her way of keeping you under control is through passive aggressive digs to your girl friend and constant praise of an ex that did a lot of damage to you. It seems like she thinks you deserved it, again because in my opinion she could not do this to your dad for some reason. Really weird to be honest. I, personally think you should go NC with her and move on with your life.

And \"both sides\"-ing a break-up where one cheated, in public, isn't just weird, it *is* taking sides. Specifically, taking the cheater's side.

We have been trying to explore why anxiety and depression are my *default* and I have to fight so hard to get out of it. \n\nI've been frustrated that, despite a healthy lifestyle (daily exercise, a large social circle, a supportive girlfriend, a lucrative career in media, etc) I am not content regularly and can catch myself in behavior patterns that are destructive in my relationships. \n\nHe's stated that this stems from my relationship with myself, which was formed by my relationship with my parents which was toxic *and still is toxic*.

I don't blame her for leaving/cheating/etc!\"\n\nThat, or she's still in love with your father but was the reason that they broke up (she cheated, started a fight or something), and she's trying to reassure herself that she's fine/better without him and living vicariously through thesr girls.", "I also feel like uninviting her and getting upset about it continues to let the terrible ex fiance win and take from you.", "Idk. My husband has an ex fiance who I only met maybe twice when we were already dating. They were young and it just didn't work out.

I am glad you are open to therapy - too many aren't. I don't know whether your therapist has suggested it, but going no contat with your parents should be high on the list of things to consider. You will never learn to love yourself when your mother tells you in her every (toxic, narcisstic) action that she doesn't consider you worthy of love.", "It must be especially hard as it doesn\u2019t sound as though OP\u2019s mother shines such effusive praise and loving support on him.", "That's fair. Though I really don't care too much about my ex anymore...it's mostly the lack of consideration from my mom.  \n\n\nI dunno, maybe I shouldn't take it so personal. That's certainly an opinion.", "I think a key difference here is that in my case my ex fiancee cheated on me while I was in a holding cell after getting caught with her pot. Then our entire friend group knew about it but she kept lying to me directly about it anyway. Then, when a guy from my college kept teasing me about her cheating on me I got into a fist fight (that I lost, badly) because I thought he was badmouthing us. \n\nThen my friend she cheated on me with finally told me, she never came clean.\n\nSo there was a very clear reason why we didn't work out and I lost most of my friends from college because of it.", "Turn the tables and ask your mom how she would feel if you made friends with someone she is not comfortable with.

Sneak her phone and unfriend/block her, it may take a while to notice, if she does at all, but may buy you some time to let her realize how this is hurtful to you)", "I hope you can find strength to move on. Good luck!", "I feel like I have. I'm not sure if I agree that not liking my mom keeping in contact with my ex = not moving on. I just feel like the difference between the way she talks to my ex and the way she talks to me/my GF publicly says something about her opinions on us."]}
