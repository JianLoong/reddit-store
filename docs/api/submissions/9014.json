Since I was a child he has always said he would pay for my wedding. \n\nAbout 5 years ago he started a relationship with lady with quite extreme views. She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live. She doesn\u2019t agree with cancer scans (like smear tests, mammograms etc) because vegans \u201cdon\u2019t get cancer\u201d, when I had my daughter she said I should be feeding her almond milk. She once came to my house for dinner and I cooked a chicken for me and my family and a nut roast for my father and her. She later dug a hole in my garden to give the chicken bones a proper funeral because she was so \u201cheartbroken to see us eating it\u2019s blood and flesh\u201d.I wish I was joking.  \n\nShe has also accused me of trying to steal her fathers house. I have never met her father, I have never set foot in her fathers house. All I know is he died recently. I had communicated some cost of living worries to my dad (not asking for money) and she ran with it and said I was trying to manipulate her into giving me her inheritance. I do not want her inheritance. \n\nLong story short, my father will only pay for my wedding if it\u2019s vegan. This not only includes food, but shoes, alcohol, what other people wear (E.g. leather) and anything else you can think of. I might have been ok with vegan food, but I\u2019m not ok with policing what others wear or food they may bring for their babies (even formula) etc. \n\nThis has upset me. It\u2019s not really about the money, we are having a very small and cheap do anyway. In the run up to the wedding this woman has also been extremely rude to my mother. On reflection I have now decided it\u2019s best all round that they do not attend. \n\nShe\u2019s now telling my dad\u2019s side of the family that it\u2019s just about the money and that I am bitter because I didn\u2019t get her dad\u2019s house (Why on Earth would I be given her dads house?!) and that my dad isn\u2019t paying for my wedding, but to be honest it\u2019s not really about the money. I don\u2019t want to be controlled over what I can and can\u2019t do on my wedding day, I\u2019m sick of her judgement (and his, now she\u2019s gotten her claws into him) and I just think it will be better for me, my siblings and my mother if they do not come. I also don\u2019t want to be lectured over milk, dairy, honey, palm oil you name it, on my wedding day and I don\u2019t want to put my guests through it either. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675432787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10skz7u/aita_for_uninviting_my_dad_to_my_wedding_because/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They dug their own grave and basically uninvited themselves.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re right that it will be better if they don\u2019t come since they can\u2019t keep themselves from trying to control everything and everyone around them. It\u2019s insufferable and you don\u2019t need that headache on your wedding day.", "NTA. The title sounds bad but it's more about setting appropriate boundaries around what can and cannot be expected of one another in relationships than money. I'm sorry this is wearing on you at a time that should be joyful.", "NTA. This controlling woman is taking over your family and your dad enables it. Of your dad wants to choose a radical vegan dogma in his life is his choice but putting conditions on yours is not right by any means. \nNo one needs that drama at a wedding.", "NTA - when it comes to weddings, money is power (trust me, I've been married over 30 years, and paying for 90% of it ourselves was best thing wife and I could have done!).  Have the wedding you can afford, make 100% of choices yourself, and do what is right for yourself and those you love. If your father has chosen this person over you, it is time to break contact - you don't need that in your life.\n\nDon't EVER believe those who try to guilt you with 'he's your father'. You didn't ask for that, and very often 'blood bonds' are used to excuse toxic nonsense. They are just people, and very often the family we choose is MUCH healthier than those we are 'related to'.", ">She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live.\n\nOh boi, I knew where this was going after I kept reading.\n\nOP how strong is your relationship with your father? Because his gf seems to have him quite tight in her grip. If he tells her everything you speak about in private, then I don't really see any reconciliation at the moment.\n\nAnything you ask of him, tell him, share with him - jesus even the happiness of having your daughter was tainted by her.\n\nPersonally, I'd be upset how he let her ruin the relationship between you. Because yes, she sounds like a person who does not like you and you have suffered under her comments, but he continues to let it happen.\n\nI think the only strong signal that can be set, is to not ask him about any money, but ask of him that he doesn't come to your wedding. She neither, but I would have not invited her in the first place.\n\nWe can't chose our family, sometimes it's a loving relationship, sometimes... not so much. But having a family is a privilege - one that your father doesn't seem to care about much if he lets her trample all over you like this.\n\nYou don't have to put up with that. You don't have to force him to choose, you can simply not participate in this mess.\n\nHave a nice wedding!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA I originally read your title and thought, what's the big deal with making sure there is a vegan option?

It's about them being controlling and judgemental.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculous", "NTA. Honestly, she sounds tiring and it's pretty apparent she's going to cause some drama so better they stay home and enjoy their tofu.", "NTA. Wow, ms ultra extreme vegan sounds intolerable. If he doesn't want to pay it's because he's trying to stay on her good side. I've a feeling that this will eventually blow up in his face. And by then he'll have no friends or relatives who want to talk to him. Attaching conditions to paying was just one step too far.", "NTA go invite your dad out to lunch alone and talk to him, explain how she\u2019s baselessly accused you of multiple things and is over the top judgmental. She doesn\u2019t need to be and shouldn\u2019t be involved in the talk. Explain to your dad that due to her behavior and him allowing it you can\u2019t invite her for fear of her ruining the day by picking a fight over and number of things with any number of people.

A similar thing happened with my grandfather when he remarried and I know it pains my dad quite a bit (as well as the rest of my family) that we barely get to see him and when we do we have to contend with his awful new wife. I\u2019d also consider if you want your dad to be part of your day and he asks about it maybe inviting him without his wife?

You assessed his proposal and decided against accepting his money.  You have then, based on experience with his wife, determined that inviting him would bring needless and wholly unnecessary drama to a day that you are supposed to enjoy.  His wife sounds like an absolute chore to be around.  I suppose you could invite your dad without a +1 but I don\u2019t see how that would change the \u201cdramatic effect\u201d this would have anyway.  Likely worth a conversation with him to firmly explain that it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about being lectured by his arrogant, holier than thou wife on your wedding day.  He can make his own decision on whether to attend without her.", "NTA\nIf your father refuses to stand by you when his lady is accusing you of trying to steal a house, he isn't worthy to stand with you in your wedding.

You shouldn't have to deal with that at all. So NTA.", "NTA for not wanting them there (or in your life at all) but you need to be clear it's not about the money.

Being that we are not vegan and will not lay requirements on our guests like the ones you and ____ are requiring, we understand that you no longer want to contribute to our wedding which is surely your prerogative.  We are going in our own direction and will pay for our own wedding.  Just as it is important to you to live by your values, we choose to live by our own which includes celebrating our marriage with our loved ones free from judgement or pressure to embrace someone else\u2019s values.  I hope you choose to join us to celebrate our wedding but I understand if you choose not to since it will not be appropriate or accepted for our guests to be harassed for any reason, including your family\u2019s choice to be vegan. \nBest,\nDaughter\u201d\n\nEff him.

You offered them vegan options, you are not forcing them to wear non vegan clothing or shoes, and your wedding is not the place to spread her vegan agenda. \n\n\nSpeaking from experience here, my child has a severe dairy allergy, and once she turned 1, her pediatrician recommended we try out vegan and vegetarian substitutes for dairy, so that\u2019s what we do. It hasn\u2019t necessarily negatively affected her health, but she is much smaller and gains weight much slower than average, and I do believe it is because she isn\u2019t having dairy like other kids her age. I would be severely worried that your step mother would potentially feed your child vegan only options without consulting you first (a lot of vegan options have little to no nutritional value for children under 5) or potentially attempt to brainwash your child into thinking that they also need to be vegan, which could cause some issues with their diet and relationship with food longterm.", "NTA. At most you should have to only have 1 plate of vegan food for her. Everything else should be your way. Your dad making the stance he did is him drawing a line to which you are able to react.

It sounds like it's time to go NC with your dad and his wife because of his wife.  That's some toxic shit that no one needs in their life.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I'd invite my dad but not his gf, explain to him the issues you have with her.\n\nShe sounds delusional. Probably because she's deficient in so many vitamins and minerals. Has she not seen what happened to the baby that was fed only almond milk and other milk alternatives? It is NOT healthy to do so.", "Your title makes it sound like it is about the money. If you really don't want people to think you feel that way, you may need to change the way you phrase things. Not inviting him because he's being super controlling and weird is fine. Although, would he be being controlling if he wasn't supposed to be paying? Choosing not to let him have any sway over your wedding, and not letting him financially contribute makes total sense.
