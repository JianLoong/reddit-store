She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live. She doesn\u2019t agree with cancer scans (like smear tests, mammograms etc) because vegans \u201cdon\u2019t get cancer\u201d, when I had my daughter she said I should be feeding her almond milk. She once came to my house for dinner and I cooked a chicken for me and my family and a nut roast for my father and her. She later dug a hole in my garden to give the chicken bones a proper funeral because she was so \u201cheartbroken to see us eating it\u2019s blood and flesh\u201d.I wish I was joking.  \n\nShe has also accused me of trying to steal her fathers house. I have never met her father, I have never set foot in her fathers house. All I know is he died recently. I had communicated some cost of living worries to my dad (not asking for money) and she ran with it and said I was trying to manipulate her into giving me her inheritance. I do not want her inheritance. \n\nLong story short, my father will only pay for my wedding if it\u2019s vegan. This not only includes food, but shoes, alcohol, what other people wear (E.g. leather) and anything else you can think of. I might have been ok with vegan food, but I\u2019m not ok with policing what others wear or food they may bring for their babies (even formula) etc. \n\nThis has upset me. It\u2019s not really about the money, we are having a very small and cheap do anyway. In the run up to the wedding this woman has also been extremely rude to my mother. On reflection I have now decided it\u2019s best all round that they do not attend. \n\nShe\u2019s now telling my dad\u2019s side of the family that it\u2019s just about the money and that I am bitter because I didn\u2019t get her dad\u2019s house (Why on Earth would I be given her dads house?!) and that my dad isn\u2019t paying for my wedding, but to be honest it\u2019s not really about the money. I don\u2019t want to be controlled over what I can and can\u2019t do on my wedding day, I\u2019m sick of her judgement (and his, now she\u2019s gotten her claws into him) and I just think it will be better for me, my siblings and my mother if they do not come.

Of your dad wants to choose a radical vegan dogma in his life is his choice but putting conditions on yours is not right by any means. \nNo one needs that drama at a wedding.", "NTA - when it comes to weddings, money is power (trust me, I've been married over 30 years, and paying for 90% of it ourselves was best thing wife and I could have done!).  Have the wedding you can afford, make 100% of choices yourself, and do what is right for yourself and those you love. If your father has chosen this person over you, it is time to break contact - you don't need that in your life.\n\nDon't EVER believe those who try to guilt you with 'he's your father'. You didn't ask for that, and very often 'blood bonds' are used to excuse toxic nonsense. They are just people, and very often the family we choose is MUCH healthier than those we are 'related to'.", ">She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live.\n\nOh boi, I knew where this was going after I kept reading.\n\nOP how strong is your relationship with your father? Because his gf seems to have him quite tight in her grip. If he tells her everything you speak about in private, then I don't really see any reconciliation at the moment.\n\nAnything you ask of him, tell him, share with him - jesus even the happiness of having your daughter was tainted by her.\n\nPersonally, I'd be upset how he let her ruin the relationship between you. Because yes, she sounds like a person who does not like you and you have suffered under her comments, but he continues to let it happen.\n\nI think the only strong signal that can be set, is to not ask him about any money, but ask of him that he doesn't come to your wedding. She neither, but I would have not invited her in the first place.\n\nWe can't chose our family, sometimes it's a loving relationship, sometimes... not so much. But having a family is a privilege - one that your father doesn't seem to care about much if he lets her trample all over you like this.\n\nYou don't have to put up with that.

You offered them vegan options, you are not forcing them to wear non vegan clothing or shoes, and your wedding is not the place to spread her vegan agenda. \n\n\nSpeaking from experience here, my child has a severe dairy allergy, and once she turned 1, her pediatrician recommended we try out vegan and vegetarian substitutes for dairy, so that\u2019s what we do. It hasn\u2019t necessarily negatively affected her health, but she is much smaller and gains weight much slower than average, and I do believe it is because she isn\u2019t having dairy like other kids her age. I would be severely worried that your step mother would potentially feed your child vegan only options without consulting you first (a lot of vegan options have little to no nutritional value for children under 5) or potentially attempt to brainwash your child into thinking that they also need to be vegan, which could cause some issues with their diet and relationship with food longterm.", "NTA.

It is NOT healthy to do so.", "Your title makes it sound like it is about the money. If you really don't want people to think you feel that way, you may need to change the way you phrase things. Not inviting him because he's being super controlling and weird is fine. Although, would he be being controlling if he wasn't supposed to be paying?
