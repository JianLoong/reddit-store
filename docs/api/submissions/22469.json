Does he seem over tired or moody (more then normal for a teen)? Is he anxious or depressed? Have his patterns of hanging out with friends changed? When he eats, is he eating a small amount or enough to make up for meals he's missing?", "Until you know what's going on, forcing him to eat is a really bad idea. You might be on solider ground if you can get him to go for a checkup with his pediatrician. If the doctor says he's an unhealthy weight, then it's time to start thinking of other steps. Until then, keep your powder dry.", "NTA..forcing him to eat would not serve any positive purpose. You are right to be concerned. Your husband should be doing more than judging you.", "NTA\n\nForcing someone to eat is never a good approach. Even for little kids. It's a sure-fire way to create food issues that will follow them for years.\n\nThat said, it is worth at least you having a conversation with his doctor to see what the doc thinks. They may have some insight as a 3rd party and someone that's likely seen this before with other kids. Then if the doc feels it's important, just take your kid in. This is one of the last times you're going to be able to just take them to a doctor even if they're not keen on the idea. And I'd let him talk to the doctor alone, and not press the doctor for details of what's discussed, just the outcome decided. There may be a topic he's not comfortable talking to you about, that he might talk to the doctor about if he feels like he's going to have some degree of privacy.\n\nStomach growling doesn't always mean hungry. Sometimes I get gassy from a food, and my stomach will burble and snarl for a while.\n\nFatigue also doesn't mean hungry in all cases. At 17 there were weeks where if I didn't get 12 hours of sleep, I was a zombie. Other weeks where 6 was just fine. It's a wild time for a boy's body & brain.\n\nFinally, it may help to look at any meds your son may be on. If they're on ADHD meds for example, a common side effect of amphetamine medications like Adderall is appetite suppression. I know from personal experience it can make you just not feel like eating more than maybe once a day.", "Info:\n\nIs your son overweight? Is he trying to lose weight?", "NAH for not forcing him, but an investigation seems warranted. Is it depression, an eating disorder, you just misreading things?", "NTA - just be sure to keep an eye on him as other users have started, boys are not immune from eating disorders and if you\u2019ve been seeing noticeable weight loss and mood changes it\u2019s definitely something worth looking out for. Or it could even be a result of depression. \nWhatever it is, you are right that forcing him to eat is not the answer. Try to talk to him and see if you can find the cause, and definitely talk to a medical doctor and therapist if things continue or get worse", "No this is good ! My father force fed me when I wasn\u2019t hungry resulting in a 19 year eating disorder you are teaching him to listen to his body and eat when hungry", "NTA - He is 17 you don\u2019t really know what is going on force feeding him isn\u2019t a good solution. I would consider talking to his doctor. Personally, I really struggle to eat when it\u2019s hot out as a kid we didn\u2019t really have AC and my mom was always forcing to eat outside because of the mess and it was a real issue for me. So, I would maybe talk to him and see if there is some issue like that going on you can help with.", "NTA, force feeding is for ducks and pate\u2026 ugh.   \nBUT\u2026 do get to the bottom of this. Eating disorders amongst teen boys are on the rise, and there are a number of health conditions (like coeliac, reflux - some serious, some not) which can really alter a person\u2019s experience of eating and change their perceptions and desire to eat.   \n\n\nYou need to understand WHY he\u2019s not eating. He might not be able to tell you. It sounds like you are trying to find a pattern, what about if it\u2019s the pasta he ate yesterday making him bloated and uncomfortable today? Or if it\u2019s a body image issue and on PE days or the days he has to pass a particular girl in school etc\u2026 harder to track stuff.   \n\n\nFind a time to sit and just chat with him. Ask him if he can tell you why he doesn\u2019t want to eat then, and whether he would like to change what he eats - he could well just want to eat differently.", "NAH - it\u2019s so hard not saying the wrong thing! I think talk to him casually (it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re walking or driving so you aren\u2019t looking at one another) and just be honest. Say that missing meals entirely isn\u2019t that good for him and is there anything that you could do to help? Snacks or smaller portions or different food? My daughter is sometimes just not hungry at all and we\u2019ve talked about it and now she will eat a bit of yoghurt or fruit or a slice of toast - just so her stomach isn\u2019t empty. The important thing is that there\u2019s no judgement", "NTA\n\n> My husband is in disagreement with me; thinks that I'm a bad mom for not doing more.\n\nWhat an asshole.", "NTA. \n\nAt 16 (or 17, your post says both) your son is quite capable of determining whether he is hungry or not, presuming no neurodivergent behaviors. \n\nI would suggest taking your minor child for a checkup, however, because you -are- concerned for him. You probably don\u2019t need to be in the exam room with him, and he may open up to the physician without you there.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is 17 not 7. If he\u2019s not hungry he\u2019s not hungry.", "NTA. Forcing kids to eat almost always doesn\u2019t turn out well. At least you talked to him about it. Your husband is an ass though. He\u2019s mad at you for not doing more? Lol he\u2019s a parent too why hasn\u2019t he tried talking to your son?", "Info- aside from belittling you, what has your husband done about it?\n\nThere are so many eating fads, it could be anything. If he has a regular doctor a visit is in order", "NTA. \"My husband is in disagreement with me; thinks that I'm a bad mom for not doing more.\"\n\nSo, that surely also means your husband is a bad dad for not doing more??\n\nIf your son insists he's fine, there's not a lot you can do other than keep an eye on the situation. It's probably a good idea to take him for a regular check-up, get some bloods done to check his vitamin levels etc. But overall, if you feel the he's generally eating a sufficient amount and there's not an obvious problem, there's not much to be done other than monitor the situation.\n\nAnd BTW, your husband could have taken your son to the doctor if he felt so strongly about it. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.", "It's actually a good thing because forcing someone to eat can cause an eating disorder. On the other side of it though, if you feel he's not eating because of an already existing eating disorder, you should consider professional help. But if he's not losing a lot of weight and says he's not hungry, it's fine. My parents had the \"clean your plate\" mentality and got me in the habit of eating until I was over-full. Took a long time to break", "He's lost a bit of weight since this all started (3 or 4 weeks), and yes he does seem a bit more tired than usual. Other than that though, he's been normal. When he does eat it's a normal amount, no more or less than he used to eat.", "He's not overweight, no. I can't think of any reason he'd be trying to lose weight, but I can't rule it out for sure of course.", "Yeah, at the end of the day I think he knows better than me, unless I see something super concerning I think I'm going to just trust his judgment.", "He just turned 17, my last sentence was a typo. I think I will take him to the doctor's, he gets an annual physical anyway, I can just move up the date.", "He hasn't really done anything. Since he's rarely in charge of anything food-related he's not sure of a good way to bring it up naturally.", "Then I'm going to go with NTA. Keep an eye on him and watch out for those signs, which I'm sure you're already doing. Also, very strange for your husband to put the onus on you and insinuate you're a bad mother, he's also a parent.", "I think that\u2019s wise. It may be nothing more than asserting his independence, or it may be something more problematic.", "He found a way to bring it up with you. \n\nIt doesn't have to come up naturally, but if it's easier that way, the next time your son's stomach growls, Dad can do whatever it is he expects you to do. NTA (I'd still make a Dr appointment though)", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he is only skipping SOME meals, that's not cause for concern - as long as he is overall healty, and eats at other meals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut still: Watch closely, it might turn into an issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My husband is in disagreement with me; thinks that I'm a bad mom for not doing more.\" ... **What is YOUR HUSBAND doing to adress the issue? Your son has TWO parents, not one! Instead of acting, he is blaming you? --- >  Your husband is an AH.**", "For me it's between NAH or YTA depending on if you've tried to get to the bottom of why he's not eating. There could be a medical or psychological cause.", "Could he be anorexic? Men can be too.", "Can confirm, I come from a family with many and varied.... bowel problems... Sometimes you can be ravenous and sometimes you can not eat for a day. With many of these conditions leaving them untreated over time can make them worse/cause damage so best to get checked just in case.", "Unless you are seriously concerned about him being anorexic I would leave it alone. Some people just aren't big eaters.", "NTA\n\nBut - might be depression or anxiety.  some people avoid food when depressed,etc; not everybody eats for comfort.\n\nI'm one of those people, been like that since I was a teen.  I eat twice a day, no snacks, even now.  Always been healthy, too.\n\nWell, except for depression and BPD.", "NTA, I think, though, taking him to a physician and maybe an eating disorder specialist for evaluation are both choices I woukd make. Eating disorders have been on the rise in adolescent males. They can be lethal.", "NTA but I'd definitely take him to a doctor and have him checked out. Also, I'm concerned because of his age. It's a vulnerable time for some kids to develop eating disorders.", "This is a good idea. I wonder if there is a way to let the doctor know some of your concerns ahead of time so they can ask questions in that area without having to potentially embarrass the son.", "Yeah that\u2019s what got me. You can\u2019t shove food down his throat but as a parent it\u2019s your responsibility to take him to the doctor", "I can't agree more. Mother's are not the only parent in charge of feeding kids.\n\nI also feel skipping a meal a day isn't time to panic. But rather an indicator that is more of a psychological spell. \n\nIf he's not joining the family dinner, when husband insists, it's about being around family. NOT the fact it's the food. My family used to get into cussing/shouting rants if you didn't join dinner. And then do nothing but belittle you for not eating. If he can join dinner without your husband making him to eat you might find the solution. Eating is very primal, we can't bring ourselves to eat when we're upset", "Could still be an eating disorder, people with Ed are very good at hiding it.. hope everything will be ok, nta", "Nta, your husband's an ah. If he's not hungry he's not hungry", "N T A for not force feeding him, but take him to a doctor, FFS. YTA for not being more concerned.", "NTA.  What is your husband expecting you to do, ground him for not eating when he should?  Not sure how that would accomplish anything.", "NTA. Boys can develop eating disorders, too, and forcing someone to eat is noooot how you want to respond if that's what your husband suspects. Often, one of the major contributors to disordered eating is control. Forcing him to eat will only make him feel even less in-control of his own body and what goes in it. If you really have concerns about your son, I suggest visiting a sub for people who are in recovery from eating disorders to get more specific advice. Good luck.", "Also if the husband thinks it\u2019s such a problem he could try right? I don\u2019t think they should be force feeding the kid but the husband shouldn\u2019t be telling his wife how she should raise the kid\u2026 seems like he could help/do it too :/", "I mean if he\u2019s showing clear signs of hunger your experience isn\u2019t really that similar", "Make sure you fill the doctor's office in about your concerns with specific examples before her sees the doctor. Otherwise they might not even go into this with him (if he's otherwise at a healthy weight).", "The husband seems to just point fingers and do nothing himself, as if he's not part of the equation.", "Yeah could be something like Ibs, an eating disorder, or something as simple as an undiagnosed food intolerance. That\u2019s what happened with my sister before she realized she was lactose intolerant.", "Hi hun, NTA \nBut I went through the SAME thing. I had anemia and anorexia sometime I'd feel hungry but then the second I saw or smelled food I know longer felt hungry and the thought of eating it or trying to eat it would make me sick. Very sick. So I wouldn't eat or I'd eat very small portions. My family tried to make me eat more and when I'd force myself to eat more I'd just throw it up or be in horrible pain.\n\nNot saying he has what I had but he could and it's good to get checked out. Even being diagnosed and trying to get help my bad eating habits caused more eating problems it gave me lasting ibs. I ended up getting gastritis too but idk if that's related yet. They claim the ibs is because for so long my body would barely eat anything, then after having a baby it like reset my system and I actually got hungry but it hurt my stomach, I developed ibs because my body was used to eating little now eating normally almost every food I eat will cause me discomfort. \n\nAnyways he could also be experiencing depression as that can affect eating habits too. Don't force him to eat but really try to talk to him and get him some help run some tests. It took me a while before I admitted something was wrong and asked my mom for help. (I was also around 16/17 when i had anemia and anorexia, I also suffered from other things so idk if they all correlated just trying to give some pointers and help from some of my experiences. I hope your son is able to find his appetite again soon)\n\n(I know I need to go back to my gastrologist for my IBS but currently can't and will soon)", "YTA - you need to do more!  you can\u2019t force him to eat - but you also can\u2019t let him starve himself to death.  ED are deadly  - he needs a doctor asap", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can *force* him to eat, he\u2019s not a toddler. But I think it\u2019s worthwhile to say, \u201cI can hear your stomach. Either eat this granola bar or explain why you\u2019re stomach\u2019s growling but you don\u2019t need food.\u201d\n\nI had this as a kid, turns out it was severe heartburn. My stomach would growl but acid reflux and bloating meant I felt like I was crammed full already. The thought of eating would make me queasy.\n\nStomach issues like IBS or lactose intolerance can cause this too\u2014loud \u201cgrowling\u201d in the stomach but it\u2019s just intestinal churning. He might be too embarrassed to tell you he\u2019s having constipation, gas, diarrhea, or even pooping blood. If he\u2019s constipated, he might not even realize that\u2019s what the issue *is*, only that his stomach feels terrible. \n\nHe also might just feel busy\u2014he\u2019s too into video game/plans with friends/etc to stop and eat something. Especially if he had to prepare food. Even a quick sandwhich can feel like it takes forever to an impatient mind. Might be a good idea to grab some cliff bars for these \u201ceat something\u201d moments.", "NTA. Pushing/forcing him to eat could develop into purging.  My kid is 17, she eats randomly but not in front of people and at odd times. My nephew is 16, he will always say he\u2019s not hungry even when it\u2019s obvious he his, but if I give him a plate of food he\u2019ll eat. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on and having a conversation with your son, but I think you\u2019re right that forcing him has the potential to push him further into ED if he has one now.", "NTA but please take him to see a doctor ASAP.", "NTA.  He is basically an adult and can decide when he wants to and doesn\u2019t want to eat. If you aren\u2019t seeing him lose a bunch of weight or appear sick (as in faint, lightheaded, sleeping all day instead of normal activity, sudden change in demeanor), it\u2019s something to not nag him about.  Plenty of people go through cycles as to when and how much they want to eat.  Forcing a child to eat is not okay unless the hospital is doing it for anorexia and that is usually monitored and bargained for more than forced.", "I have to ask:  why isn\u2019t your HUSBAND doing more?  Why isn\u2019t he a bad FATHER?\n\nOr is this not his child and you\u2019ve agreed he wouldn\u2019t parent him?"]}
