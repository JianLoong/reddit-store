There are vast differences between us, socially and politically. She lets me know that she's visiting town, and we talk about hanging out. I asked her if she could visit me solo. She said it wasn't going to happen; which I accepted.\n\nI spent days cleaning my apartment. Cat litter cleared out and changed a day before. Thorough vacuuming. They arrive, and within 30 minutes he whispers into her ear. She tells me \"Dave has some really bad sensitivities to cat-smells, and he's telling me that the smell in your place makes him nauseous.\"\n\nBeing insulted in my home put me on edge, especially since I'd taken pains to make my place pristine. I opened every window, to let the place air out. My friend is uncomfortable as her husband is becoming more and more hostile; they have cats and they go to huge lengths to deal with smells.\n\nI set chairs on my balcony, so we can sit and talk in the fresh air. He's getting mean, and this isn't good enough. I suggest we head to a local park, 4 blocks away. My friend says that she has a blister on her foot from the walking she's been doing, and can't walk 4 blocks. There's another park just 1 block away; there's well-tended green grass, under the shade of some trees. We can sit and talk there. He's dismissive.\n\nHe insists we find a restaurant. I'm immune-compromised, and in my area, boosters haven't been available for a year, and covid numbers are going up. I expect this to only make him hostile towards me. I tell them that I haven't dined in a restaurant in years and I don't want to, hoping for understanding. She asks if there's anywhere with outdoor dining, but there isn't any within a radius of less than 4 blocks.\n\nI'm feeling trapped. I don't want to force her to walk on an injured foot, and not to find an outdoor restaurant I know doesn't exist. But everything has to be about her husband's comfort. \n\nAs we're leaving, I decide to change the topic to something funny. I have a neighbour who refuses to obey the fire code, propping open the fire-door in our hall.

My friend and I were making our visit worse for his sake, and he was still whining. \"Okay, if that's how it's going to be, you two have a good evening. I will talk to you later,\" and went back inside.\n\nBehind me, I hear him give me a chirpy \"Okay!\" and nothing else.\n\nI send my friend a message, apologizing for needing to nope out of the situation. A week later I still haven't heard back from her. \n\nI'm afraid that I've blown a 15 year friendship, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could have done differently.

I asked if she and I could just hang out solo because she gave me every reason to believe this would be a bad idea.

A lot of what followed was just him becoming more brittle; his tone and expression and body language more and more hostile. When we were on the balcony, he was looking for my wifi, and gave me a scathing look as he said \"I hope to God yours isn't this 'PusDrippingDick.'\" I laughed out loud, because it always entertains me when people see that, but he gave me this look of undisguosed, joyless contempt and shook his head. I expect people who I'm likely to be able to get along with to roll their eyes or get a little chuckle out of that. To appreciate the joke on my neighbours it represents.

I think that in the years that she's been living in that culture, in that situation, she's changed a lot, in ways which were invisible to me through the peephole of Discord conversations. \n\nI'm not saying she's pretending to agree with her husband. I'm saying she's adopted his values because it's necessary for her to do so for the sake of self-preservation. I'm sure it's sincere; it's just that the reasons she arrived at these values are pretty unpleasant.", "This doesn\u2019t really sound like a friendship you wanted to keep anyway.

Over the course of the last couple of years it's become impossible to discuss any topic with her which isn't just totally trivial and lighthearted. Anything of substance upsets her so deeply that she lashes out in anger, or freezes me out for weeks at a time, or both. It had become a very superficial friendship, and while I've been willing to look past this, I'm looking at that unwillingness on her part in a new way. \n\nAnd I think a part of it is that her years with her husband have had the effect of forcing her to lock away the part of herself that cares about anything or expresses any values of any kind, because it's not good for her to do so with him in her life.", "Her situation was a difficult one. Poor mental and physical health, and a spotty education and employment history. She was having a very hard time surviving until she married rich.

Here's my own post I made on the day of the incident: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vjevf/aita\\_for\\_telling\\_my\\_friend\\_his\\_home\\_stinks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vjevf/aita_for_telling_my_friend_his_home_stinks/)\n\nYTA YTA YTA YTA Y ARE SO TA.\n\nFirst off, I'd appreciate if you'd remove real names from your post, how absolutely dare you.\n\nSecond off, sorry not sorry it took me so long to respond to your message. I was on VACATION and didn't want to spoil what little of it I had left on drama. I had since been stewing on your message since I returned figuring out a way to reply nicely, only to get the most asinine message this morning  blaming it entirely on my husband.\n\nThird off, it was more than just a smell that my husband was sensitive to. Please note that the issue was very much with me as well. It smelled overwhelmingly of old cat piss, we could smell it coming up the hallway to your apartment. When we entered your apartment the miasma of it hit us like a brick wall, you could see dust and cat hair floating in the air, you could see sticky fur-covered surfaces, you could see spills that hadn't been cleaned up, the back of my clothes were absolutely covered in a thick layer of cat hair just from sitting on your chair. This was more than just a faint smell that only my husband was sensitive to.\n\nNow I see this and its full of lies and exaggerations:\n\n1. There was no solo invitation, but I did make it clear that my husband and I are a package deal now that we're married.\n2. He did whisper into my ear that he didn't feel safe eating in your apartment, a statement I AGREED WITH. I initially offered to eat out at a restaurant, our treat, but you're so incredibly paranoid of covid you refused. At that point, I said, verbatim, \"I am saying this in the kindest  way possible, as your friend, we are having trouble handling the smell of your apartment.\" I never said: \"Dave has some really bad sensitivities to cat-smells, and he's telling me that the smell in your place makes him nauseous.\" When we were on the balcony I mentioned that Dave is ea little more sensitive to these types of smells, that was it.\n3. My husband never became hostile. He had friendly chats with you about video games and was extremely polite. My discomfort was with YOUR HOME and the situation YOU PUT US IN.\n4. No chairs were set on the balcony. The balcony was very small and I had to stand in the doorway while the two of you stood on the balcony.\n5. The park you suggested going to was about 15 mins walk away, I had a huge blister on the sole of my foot from trekking through several gates at several airports to make the nearly 5000 km trip, on top of the several days leading up to our meeting I spent out with my friends and parents doing activities that were largely on my feet. The other \"park that's a block away\" you suggested was a grassy area outside of a shopping center, you said we would have to sit on the grass as there are no benches. I AM ALLERGIC TO GRASS. My husband wasn't dismissive, I WAS. I'm in my mid-30s, my husband is in his mid-40s, we did not want to sit outside a grocery store on a small patch of grass like middle schoolers.\n6. I was the one who initially suggested a restaurant. I was the one who initially suggested a restaurant with outdoor seating. I was the one who offered to pay for an uber and the meal to the restaurant. I was the only one WHO MADE ANY EFFORT TO LOOK UP RESTAURANTS ON GOOGLE.\n7. \"But everything has to be about her husband's comfort.\" WHAT ABOUT MY COMFORT\n8. \"I tell them about when I got fire-men to talk to him about keeping them closed and how he started throwing a screaming fit.\" You did a racist Serbian impression of the \"screaming fit\" at FULL VOLUME directly in my husband's ear. There was no interruption, at the closing of a sentence my husband said EXACTLY what I was thinking, the cat smell permeated greatly into the hallway which seems why your neighbor even mentioned the cats at all. It was clear to both of us this is why the fire door is propped open, to air out the hallway that your home stinks up! He just worked up the guts to say it after you shouted so rudely in his ear!\n9. \"Behind me, I hear him give me a chirpy \"Okay!\" and nothing else.\" It wasn't chirpy, it was at best confused. I also said \"okay\" in the same tone. It was an absolutely confusing experience.\n\n\"I'm afraid that I've blown a 15 year friendship\"Yeah, ya blew it, if you didn't with your message then you certainly did with this post. Its been a long time coming anyway. You're consistently rude and condescending, you talk down to anyone you're in a conversation with. Not just with my husband but with my friends at the movie theatre, with me for a long time. I've asked you several times to not bring up politics or hot button topics around me, something I also ask of my husband and which he respects. Yet even sitting next to you at the movie theatre all you could do was show me twitter posts and talk about Elon Musk and twitter Nazis etc etc. I tried to steer the conversation away but it kept steering back to you showing something on twitter I was absolutely not interested in. You were rude to my friend for making a conversational comment during something you said, you were rude to us outside the theater by standing coldly off to the side and making it known you were only interested in topics of conversation that suited your interests specifically, you were rude when you kept trying to interrupt my husband to show us more twitter posts.You were the only friend my husband had a problem with. He was able to have fun and amicable conversations with all of my other friends even about stuff they disagreed with, even with political stuff they had fun and amicable conversations. You're simply not capable of that,  you aren't capable of having conversations about anything that doesn't suit your specific interests. So go figure it took me so long to get back to you to try to talk to you in a way that wouldn't get your sarcastic rude quips thrown at me. When I got your message this morning throwing the entire thing on my husband I just lost it, I gave up trying to be civil, trying to be amicable, trying to make this friendship work. Nothing of what I said came from my husband, it came from ME.\n\nI'll respond to this comment with some issues I've taken with your comments in this thread, as well as the response I sent you this morning for transparency.", "So to review:\n\n\n1.  House reeks\n\n\n2.  Covid nutjob\n\n\n3.  Tattled on a neighbor to the fire department and apparently this is a point of real pride so much so that you need to brag about it.\n\n\n\n\nYeah, YTA.", "NTA. They accepted your hospitality and proceeded to insult you. You did everything you could to make them comfortable, but the husband was rigid and very unpleasant, and she did nothing to stop him. Let her sit with your apology. Check in again in a week or a month. It's in her court.", "Take another shot. You'll feel better.", "Sorry to break it to you but this person isn\u2019t acting like a friend anymore.  Also, if she is not allowed to see friends without the husband accompanying her, then she is likely in an abusive relationship as well.  NTA.  Life is too short to have people around you that insult you and make you feel like shit.", "Friendships end for all sorts of reasons. You are not the reason this one failed.", "I would not have entertained the myriad of options (parks, balcony, restaurants, etc.). Instead, I would have said 'I'm sorry to hear that husband is sensitive to cat and that we will have to cut the visit short.' And then ushered them out. \n\nNTA", "It sounds like you might have toxoplasmosis.", "Nah you missed what she once was. Ppl change and some have gotten a lot worst in their negative antics. Ppl are more outspoken on their hate now a days and your friend is morally fine with it. So you're not really losing much other than the memories", "NTA, extremely rude guest, your friend should apologize for her husband's behavior.", "I had to walk away from my oldest friend for basically the same issue you had with your friends husband (and I guess now your friend). I could sense he was drifting further and further into a cult like mentality and I tried to ignore it for years but when he stated confidently that 1/6 was a false flag operation perpetrated by BLM activists I knew I couldn't be around him anymore. Sounds like you've had your similar moment.", "NTA. If anything you gave far too much grace. \n\nHe was being outright disrespectful to you in *your* home, and offered zero alternatives.\n\nShe married a spoiled baby. You\u2019re better off.", "YTA- You sound absolutely insufferable.

Yes I chose a happy relationship with my husband over the sarcastic put-downs of my friend and his squalid apartment.", "Subject of the op! We knew of the cats, my husband is not sensitive to cats, my husband is sensitive to squalid apartments that smell of old cat-pee, as am I. We have 2 cats of our own! We were never extended a solo invitation, but I did make it clear we are a package deal now that we're married.", "This whole thing is fake. OP is controlling both accounts. \n\nBoth accounts have a response comment that says \u201cI just heard back from my friend after posting and they left me a scathing message\u201d", "Going to have to agree, they both mention the fire escape door and the comment.", "Yeah.  It appears that there is more to the story.  I have to be honest, I wouldn\u2019t have stayed in OPs place either and probably would have found a reason to leave or would have said something directly. It clearly appears he is not aware of the level of smell there truly is.  Likely the place needs a real deep cleaning.", "That poster posted here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164gbiw/aita\\_for\\_bailing\\_on\\_a\\_friend\\_visiting\\_me\\_on\\_her/jya6kr7/", "OP Sounds insufferable. I knew there had to be another side to this story. This needs to be pinned.", "Wow this adds a lot more context, thank you for sharing your side.", "This is the tea.  I freaking love Reddit.", "...OMG OP is an IRL twitter waco.\nOddly enough your retelling is exactly how I imagine someone like that would be with friends.\ud83e\udd14", "Why doesn't any of this surprise me.", "Please talk to a therapist instead of pretending to be both people in a reddit conflict", "It\u2019s very curious to me that the OP says you two were friends for around 15 years and you\u2019re in your mid-30s and OP is close to 50. So this man in his 30s was becoming friends with a woman who was 18-22 at the time? I\u2019m not trying to infantilize you or imply you weren\u2019t at his \u201clevel\u201d but I think it\u2019s curious context that there\u2019s a significant age gap in a friendship that started when you were barely a legal adult and the OP seems exceptionally critical of your husband and your marriage.", "Subject of the op here! It was more than just a normal cat smell. The place reeked of cat pee, we could smell it down the apartment. Surfaces were covered in a thick sticky layer of dust and cat hair and old spills. You could see dust and cat hair floatin gin the air. It was not an environment I was comfortable with, as was my husband. I was the one who voiced concerns about this, I was the one who offered several suggestions shot down by the op. We had previously spent the week visiting my other friends, as well as days following this experience. This friend is the only one my husband had an issue with.", "Subject of the op! My husband never voiced his opinion of the smell to op inside his home, only the last comment about the fire door being propped open to vent the overwhelming old cat pee smell that permeated from his apartment into the shared hallway. The state of his apartment was unhealthy, it was more than just a faint smell. I could not stay there any longer, which was why I suggested going out to eat. When op refused to go to a restaurant over covid fears I was left in a tough position because I had to get out of that apartment. I said, verbatim, \"I am saying this as kindly as I can, as a friend, we are having trouble handling the smell of your apartment.\" There was no point where either of us were rude. I am not embarrassed by my husband, I am proud of him, he's the light of my life, we visited many of my friends this trip and this was the only one my husband had issues with.", "Subject of the op here! We were aware of his 2 cats, we have 2 cats ourselves. My husband isn't sensitive to normal cat smells. My husband was cordial with op, made effort to have engaging conversations with him. My husband was going to buy him dinner. The apartment reeked of old cat piss, you could smell it down the shared hallway. There were thick sticky layers of dust and cat hair and old spills. You could see the dust and cat hair in the air. It was unhealthy and we did not feel comfortable staying there. Most of the statements about the smell of his place came from me. If he truly vacuumed and changed the cat litter I fear for what his apartment looked like beforehand.", "Hmm?", "Subject of the OP here! My husband is not old-money. His father had to piss in a shared bucket when he was a kid. My husband didn't inherit anything. We are a bit more well-off than others, we own a small house that we had to budget to afford. I understand we are in a privileged position. This has nothing to do with that and everything to do with your attitude and behavior. You're nearing 50 and you haven't changed in the 15 years I've known you. You're stuck in your 20s, the way you dress, the way you carry yourself, the way you talk, the way you live.", "People with scent sensitivity usually HATE air freshener. So you probably didn't miss a chance to fix it that way.", "The whole thing is fake. Same person running both accounts for sure. They went to way too much effort to include the same story beats in both posts and the response comments from each account uses the same vocabulary.", "Why did you post about this from the opposite perspective a few days ago and say your apartment reaked of cat piss?", "Now your place just smells like Febreeze and cat piss.", "You're a nasty person my goodness, learn some decency.", "Who knows. The point is, if I'd been told cat smells were a particular issue for him, I'd have made an effort.", "This is like the 3rd post today where someone has linked \u201cthe other side\u201d of a story. So fake.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they were based on your friend\u2019s recollection of the day that predates yours and presents a far grimier description of your living situation than yours does. \n\nAlso, were you a 30-something year old man trying to become friends with a woman who was 18-22 at the time?", "Tbf, the WiFi \u201cjoke\u201d is offensive and truly isn\u2019t for everyone. Him thinking it was inappropriate isn\u2019t really a sign of a bad personality.  i think you know it is offensive and really are trying to get a rise out of people.", "It's not offensive. It's just silly. Only the pressiest of prisses would choose to be offended by something like this.", "Oof, you gotta get them spayed *before* they hit puberty.  :(", "Lol and there you go proving my point.", "And you can add to your list that her husband decided you were not good enough so he worked hard at destroying what was left of your friendship.", "The friend in this situation has actually commented that OPs assessment of the whole ordeal is completely accurate and that his home is actually squalid and covered in old, I cleaned cat piss and hair. So I don\u2019t think he husband is doing the destroying of the relationship here."]}
