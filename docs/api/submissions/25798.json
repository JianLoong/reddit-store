There are vast differences between us, socially and politically. She lets me know that she's visiting town, and we talk about hanging out. I asked her if she could visit me solo. She said it wasn't going to happen; which I accepted.\n\nI spent days cleaning my apartment. Cat litter cleared out and changed a day before. Thorough vacuuming. They arrive, and within 30 minutes he whispers into her ear. She tells me \"Dave has some really bad sensitivities to cat-smells, and he's telling me that the smell in your place makes him nauseous.\"\n\nBeing insulted in my home put me on edge, especially since I'd taken pains to make my place pristine. I opened every window, to let the place air out. My friend is uncomfortable as her husband is becoming more and more hostile; they have cats and they go to huge lengths to deal with smells.\n\nI set chairs on my balcony, so we can sit and talk in the fresh air. He's getting mean, and this isn't good enough. I suggest we head to a local park, 4 blocks away. My friend says that she has a blister on her foot from the walking she's been doing, and can't walk 4 blocks. There's another park just 1 block away; there's well-tended green grass, under the shade of some trees. We can sit and talk there. He's dismissive.\n\nHe insists we find a restaurant. I'm immune-compromised, and in my area, boosters haven't been available for a year, and covid numbers are going up. I expect this to only make him hostile towards me. I tell them that I haven't dined in a restaurant in years and I don't want to, hoping for understanding. She asks if there's anywhere with outdoor dining, but there isn't any within a radius of less than 4 blocks.\n\nI'm feeling trapped. I don't want to force her to walk on an injured foot, and not to find an outdoor restaurant I know doesn't exist. But everything has to be about her husband's comfort. \n\nAs we're leaving, I decide to change the topic to something funny. I have a neighbour who refuses to obey the fire code, propping open the fire-door in our hall. I tell them about when I got fire-men to talk to him about keeping them closed and how he started throwing a screaming fit.\n\nHe interrupts to acidly say \"He probably kept it open because of the stink of your cat.\"\n\nI reached my limit. My friend and I were making our visit worse for his sake, and he was still whining. \"Okay, if that's how it's going to be, you two have a good evening. I will talk to you later,\" and went back inside.\n\nBehind me, I hear him give me a chirpy \"Okay!\" and nothing else.\n\nI send my friend a message, apologizing for needing to nope out of the situation. A week later I still haven't heard back from her. \n\nI'm afraid that I've blown a 15 year friendship, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could have done differently. So that's what brings me here: Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693309845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164gbiw/aita_for_bailing_on_a_friend_visiting_me_on_her/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is. Even if there was a smell, which there probably is, he didn\u2019t have to be such a dick about it.", "Nta you didn't ruin this friendship. Your friends husband did. He was rude and your friend let him be rude to you.", "NTA.  If not the cat smell, I\u2019m guessing he would have found something else to complain about.  The way he shot down every possible suggestion makes me think that he just didn\u2019t want to visit his wife\u2019s friend (and didn\u2019t want to let her visit on her own), so he did everything he could to ruin the evening.  And unfortunately your friend just went right along with it.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad that your friend has lost herself to her husband. He gives me abusive vibes, not like overt abuse, but the subtle controlling kind. He was TA. When you\u2019re guest in someones home you don\u2019t voice your negative opinions. Its rude. It\u2019s fine to suggest going elsewhere, but if you can\u2019t say anything nice, say nothing at all. Its not hard. Your friend probably isn\u2019t mad at you, she\u2019s probably incredibly embarrassed by her husband & I would bet that this is how all of their visits have gone on this trip. Poor girl is probably just trapped :(", "Were they aware that you had a cat?  Did they inform you husband's sensitive before hand?\n\nDo you think he was stating these sensitivities just so they didn't have to stay with you?

You had vacuumed and changed the litter.", "Info: can we get a little more detail on Husband\u2019s mean comments? You mention the fire door thing, which could be interpreted as a joke with the exception of the mean tone, which is difficult to get across in text. The \u201cok\u201d is a pretty normal response to being asked to leave, again with the exception of the troublesome tone. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to doubt but I think this judgement would be much easier if we all had a couple specimens of Husband\u2019s comments.", "NTA but that friendship is over until they divorce.", "NTA\n\nSounds like it's for the best, since you can't hang out with her without him.

She had a scathing reply, much of it centered around things which I would never have expected to hear from her before she married some rich, old-money American plutocrat. It's clear that her whole cultural outlook has changed in ways that make her view my working-class existence with a contempt she never would have before. Perhaps this was inevitable.", "Yeah, we speak of my cats and share photos frequently. \n\nI have found myself wishing she'd mentioned his smells sensitivity. I would have bought some cans of air freshener beforehand and emptied them out in advance of their arrival. \n\nMy sense is that she and her husband are never more than 5 meters apart. He has no job. He lives on rich family investments, and so I don't think they're ever out of eyeshot.", "During the last time she and he were both in town together, I remember asking if I was going to meet him. At that time, she told me she didn't think he and I would get along. I was willing to take her word for it then, and nothing I had learned about him since then changed my mind. I asked if she and I could just hang out solo because she gave me every reason to believe this would be a bad idea. But I also think that in the years they've been together they've become so codependent that the possibility of her just having her own thing going on in her life, even for a few hours, has become impossible.", "Yeah, I accept that cats can be smelly creatures. That isn't a mystery. There's a reason I took care to change the litter and thoroughly vacuum in the days before their visit. \n\nI'm even willing to grant that he's exactly as sensitive as he says he is. I don't think I BELIEVE him, but I will allow the premise. \n\nBut at the point where he is being given everything he wants and everything is being made all about him and he is STILL giving me a hard time, he just becomes someone I cannot bring myself to endure when I'm trying to have a pleasant time with someone else.", "Yeah, after five years as basically a kept woman, utterly reliant upon him for her every need, I don't think she's in a position to disagree with him or stick up for me. It's just not in the cards. \n\nSo I mean, if the situation is such that I can't deal with him, I can't be friends with her.", "Oh yeah, we speak and trade photos of our cats frequently. \n\nI think he was being essentially honest, but hamming up his reaction. Like I'm sure he wasn't making it up that he didn't like the cat smell but I think he exaggerated the intensity of his reaction because it was worth ruining the whole night over a trivial annoyance.", "My first draft of this post was about 7000 characters and had a lot more detail before I learned of the community's 3000 character limit and I had to trim most of the details down! \n\nGetting his wife to tell me that my home made him nauseous was in and of itself intensely offputting. A lot of what followed was just him becoming more brittle; his tone and expression and body language more and more hostile. When we were on the balcony, he was looking for my wifi, and gave me a scathing look as he said \"I hope to God yours isn't this 'PusDrippingDick.'\" I laughed out loud, because it always entertains me when people see that, but he gave me this look of undisguosed, joyless contempt and shook his head. I expect people who I'm likely to be able to get along with to roll their eyes or get a little chuckle out of that. To appreciate the joke on my neighbours it represents. But his actual anger at it communicated to me that this was the sort of stick in the mud I would never spend time with of my own accord.", "Honestly, I'm taking the note that there is a smell present that I'm just not aware of but others might be. \n\nThis morning I bought a couple of cans of Febreeze. Brought the cats into my bedroom and closed the door, trapping them inside. Then I went and opened all of the other windows, ran a fan and just emptied one can out all over my suite, and left the windows open and fan blowing for a few hours. \n\nNow I've shooed the cats out of my bedroom and closed the door. Opened my bedroom window wide, got the fan blowing in here and emptied a second can of Febreeze. \n\nIf there WAS any smell, it's surely going to be destroyed by the end of the day!", "Money doesn't make you an asshole. It just helps you show it clearly to everybody,", "If it hadn't been the cats, it would've been something else. And their relationship sounds creepy.", "And your absolutely right. If she is choosing money over your friendship with how he treats you. Then this friendship won't last.\n\nBut unfortunately it does seem like she is ok with her husband behavior.  \n\nI mean at the very least she could have told you about his sensitivity to smells.", "I mean, I\u2019ll allow that she\u2019s probably in a tight spot *now*, but the decisions that led her into it were hers. \n\nShe chose to begin a romantic relationship with this man. She chose to *marry* this man. She chose to prioritize wealth over shared values. She chose to *change* her values to align with his. She chose to forgo her own income stream and rely solely on his to keep her fed and sheltered. All of these were decisions that she made in what she thinks were her best interests.\n\nShe has gotten the life she asked for. And it doesn\u2019t have room for you.", "The husband sounds like he is the a$$.\n\nYou didn't ruin the friendship.  Husband intentionally went out of his way to ruin in, in a way that make you look like the bad person.  \n\nI am aossry that you have lost a friendship.  it may come back, if and when she realizes how manipulative he is.\n\nNTA", "Okay NTA, that goes beyond being grumpy due to a nausea spell, which I can empathize with directly, into nasty unacceptable behaviour. Especially trying to take issue over the wifi name how can you be mad about that lol.", "There's an expression I've been familiar with for years now, but never really understood until I met this guy:\n\n\"Politics is downstream from culture.\"\n\nThis is a guy whose whole cultural outlook - his behaviour, his values, his sense of his place in the world - comes from a place of idle wealth and separation from working-folk. So of course he would be this huge righ-wing Trumper. What else would he be?\n\nMy friend has been living in that world for half a decade, now, and moreover, it's been vitally important to her survival that she not rock the boat. She needs to endorse these cultural values or else she endangers that marriage and thus her ability to live. \n\nI think it's not just the money; it's what it represents and what sort of attitude towards the world it's inculcated in him and his family, and by extension now, her too.", "Everyone I've spoken to about this has volunteered some version of the same thought: it sounds as though he just wanted to control her and limit her access to other friends, which doesn't sound inaccurate to me.", "It's kind of funny. I always thought of the wifi name as a very small joke on people who are super-serious sticks in the mud, but I never thought I would be in a position of actually meeting someone like that and seeing the look of affronted outrage on his face. I've had that wifi name for like 15 years, and finally I saw the guy who it was a joke on, all along.", "I am sorry but I don\u2019t think you are right. Why is it vitally important for her to be with someone if she doesn\u2019t agree with his views?\n\nPeople vote with their feet, and you have seen where her feet brought her, and where they are staying.\n\nI think that your friendship died a long time ago, just that no one noticed because of the distance. You both had holograms of how the other was, and time did its thing.\n\nBut don\u2019t for a second think that she does not agree with her husband", "If not this then something else. It's just sad and you are NTA\n\nI'm sorry you lost her and I'm sorry she lost herself.", "I think you're mostly right. I think that in the years that she's been living in that culture, in that situation, she's changed a lot, in ways which were invisible to me through the peephole of Discord conversations. \n\nI'm not saying she's pretending to agree with her husband. I'm saying she's adopted his values because it's necessary for her to do so for the sake of self-preservation. I'm sure it's sincere; it's just that the reasons she arrived at these values are pretty unpleasant.", "This doesn\u2019t really sound like a friendship you wanted to keep anyway. It\u2019s pretty clear that her company is not very enjoyable for you, even apart from her husband\u2019s fussiness.", "Self preservation is not the same as keeping your mouth shut so your rich husband will buy you shiny things.", "I guess this event has had the effect of shining a light on certain issues that had been there for a while. Over the course of the last couple of years it's become impossible to discuss any topic with her which isn't just totally trivial and lighthearted. Anything of substance upsets her so deeply that she lashes out in anger, or freezes me out for weeks at a time, or both. It had become a very superficial friendship, and while I've been willing to look past this, I'm looking at that unwillingness on her part in a new way. \n\nAnd I think a part of it is that her years with her husband have had the effect of forcing her to lock away the part of herself that cares about anything or expresses any values of any kind, because it's not good for her to do so with him in her life.", "Her situation was a difficult one. Poor mental and physical health, and a spotty education and employment history. She was having a very hard time surviving until she married rich. I can understand why she made the decisions she has, even as I detest the effects."]}
