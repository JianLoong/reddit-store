If the driver doesn't want to have a polite conversation with you then you call the police and let the driver have the conversation with them.

There also is no guarantee that they will actually pay for anything they say they will, especially if there is hidden damage that isn't immediately visible.\n\nI assume the police got the driver's name and insurance, but I wouldn't trust that they were the actual driver, so I would be prepared for their insurance company to refuse to pay.

Any rationally thinking adult should recognize that hitting a couple cars and either informing the owners on the spot or grabbing a paper and leaving notes would be better than getting charged with a hit and run.

I will be honest, my car was not the best but it was my transportation. The door was banged up so it didn't open and the side mirror was missing. We went to the door and my dad offered to fix the damages with pick n pull parts, it was $25 the guy flat out refused, said he didn't hit my car and slammed the door in our face. We got the cops out, they saw damage to his vehicle that matched my car and in the end he was ticketed for a hit and run and his insurance paid for the blue book value of my car because it was older and they don't pay off pick n pull fixes. I fixed my car for $20 (we found a deal) and I got about $3500 from his insurance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing honest and doing the right thing is always the way to go.

I sincerely doubt that the wife was driving as he could've told OP at the start.
