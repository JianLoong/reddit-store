If the driver doesn't want to have a polite conversation with you then you call the police and let the driver have the conversation with them.

There also is no guarantee that they will actually pay for anything they say they will, especially if there is hidden damage that isn't immediately visible.\n\nI assume the police got the driver's name and insurance, but I wouldn't trust that they were the actual driver, so I would be prepared for their insurance company to refuse to pay.

The offender should've rang the doorbell and apologized for the accident before exchanging info.\n\nThe fact that he said \"Don't worry about it, I'll handle it\" and NEVER went in to identify the perpetrator, tells me that he more than likely gave permission to drive a car to someone without a driver's liscence.\n\nThis time it was just material damage.
