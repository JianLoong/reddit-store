I walk down there and there\u2019s a party on the front lawn, I see the car and the damage to the front and I ask them who the car belongs to and if they saw the accident, they all said no.

He said the guy wasn\u2019t there and proceeded to say he\u2019ll come see me in the morning and take care of it.  I said fine and walked back but my neighbors were still congregating and said I need to file a police report if I can\u2019t get any information from the guy.  \n\n\nI went back and talked to the guy and explained I really need the info or atleast meet the guy that was driving or I need to file a report and I really didn\u2019t want to do that but I needed something.

Screw that. Calling the police was the right thing to do.", "NTA\n\nThe first thing your insurance company is going to ask is if you called the police and whether there was a police report filed.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA and listen to your father. He's absolutely right. I bet they were covering for someone who was drunk, and possibly drunk underage and they were hoping it will all go away. \n\nBut getting a police report filed is definitely the right thing.", "NTA- they didn't give you much of a choice. You tried to be nice several times, and they showed themselves to be cowards and liers. You had to do what you had to do. They were lucky you went back to ask for more information and told them you were calling the police.", "NTA\n\n\"I should trust him\" You barely know the guy! I would be livid.", "NTA\nThey should have called the police to report it.\nYou need to protect your interest", "NTA - their behavior sounds really suspicious and I would be inclined to NOT trust them. The only thing I would consider against filing the report is if it's going to lead to conflict with your neighbor now. Usually never a good idea to get into a fued with someone you live near and see every day. \n\nIf i were you, I'd consider putting up a security camera or two around your house.", "NTA. He\u2019s not your friend. You can\u2019t trust him just because he says you can. It\u2019s clear he was jerking you around and would\u2019ve kept doing so for as long as you let him. The police report will help with your insurance immensely.", "NTA - You don\u2019t know them well enough to accept their vague response. That must\u2019ve been scary and I think you handled it as well as could be expected.", "NTA - I am not a lawyer, but this likely fits the definition of a hit-and-run accident, which is a crime in many states.  You did them a **favor** by going to find them and ask for the driver's name and insurance rather than starting with the police.  If the driver doesn't want to have a polite conversation with you then you call the police and let the driver have the conversation with them.  (I've had to do this to get insurance from another driver at least once, and I've had a case where another driver insisted on waiting for the police before taking my insurance, which I was fine with.)\n\nI agree with others who have said there is something VERY fishy going on here, likely covering for a drunk driver.  There also is no guarantee that they will actually pay for anything they say they will, especially if there is hidden damage that isn't immediately visible.\n\nI assume the police got the driver's name and insurance, but I wouldn't trust that they were the actual driver, so I would be prepared for their insurance company to refuse to pay.  Hopefully you have collision and comprehensive, so that you're protected in that scenario.", "NTA at all", "NTA\n\nIt was good that you filed a police report. The guy was trying to get away with it. He was probably thinking to offer you some money so you can do some shady repairs on your car, without going to the police.", "NTA", "NTA, nope.", "NTA in my opinion. You had no malicious intent and were willing to listen to what happened if they had come forward. Filing a report is standard and you were within your right to do that!", "NTA. By refusing to communicate they did this to themselves.", "NTA, you have to cover your own property and back and I guarantee you your neighbors would have done the same thing. Sorry this happened", "NTA\n\nYour neighbours were not honest with you from the start. Filing a police report was completely justified.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
