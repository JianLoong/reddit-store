I have always had pets, and told him since day 1 that I would always have pets. He didn\u2019t grow up with pets. I love all animals, and when it comes to animals I am very sensitive. \n\nWe currently have 6 dogs ages 10 months-12.5 years. This past Monday I took our 12.5 y/o GSD/lab mix (Thor) to the vet for what I thought was arthritis in his front paw. The vet said she thought she felt a mass and wanted to do X-rays. The X-rays came back and the bone in his front leg was destroyed from osteosarcoma (bone cancer). It had not spread yet, but he was obviously in a lot of pain. At his age, amputating the leg was not an option that seemed feasible. As a large breed dog, his life expectancy is not long to begin with, and I read amputation buys you about 6 more months, a small percentage lives an additional 2 years with amputation and chemo. \n\nPlease keep in mind, it\u2019s not a financial thing. Last year our 14 y/o Cocker Spaniel had developed a non-cancerous tumor in her ear canal. We opted for surgery and she only lived for 7 more months (she was never the same after the surgery). \n\nThe vet told me that it would be best to euthanize Thor before it spread, or the bones started to break. Osteosarcoma is very painful and I didn\u2019t want my boy to suffer. I decided to take him home, with lots of pain meds, for a week and just spoil him rotten. \n\nDuring the visit, I was sending my husband texts updating him. When I told him I\u2019d have to choose when to euthanize Thor his response was \u201ctoday\u201d. I was all alone at the vet, and Thor was our family dog, so I wanted the family to be there with him the day of. \n\nMy husband and I have separate bank accounts, but share a joint credit card that I use to get rewards back. That day I paid the vet bill with that CC. It was only $350. It was not even 5 minutes after I left the vet, when my husband sent me a text saying I needed to send him the $350 from my own money. I was livid! Here I am balling my eyes out having just been told I have to put my boy to sleep, and he\u2019s giving me a hard time about $350. \n\nI told him he was a heartless person, and he said, \u201cyou all wanted Thor, not me\u201d. It was at that point that I told him I hated him and to stop texting me or I\u2019d block him. \n\nIt\u2019s almost Sunday, and we haven\u2019t spoken. I honestly have nothing to say to him. Monday my kids and I will take Thor, and I haven\u2019t told my husband; I don\u2019t plan on including him. I want Thor to feel nothing but love. So AITA for saying I hate him, and honestly meaning it, over my dog?\n\nNote: I moved the $350, not because he demanded it, I had every intention of doing so (it just wasn\u2019t my main priority w/i 5 minutes of leaving the vet). Also, I had also moved money to his account earlier in the week to cover some bills along with an additional $400  to cover any purchases I made with the joint CC.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t ask me if I was going to move the money, he demanded it\n\nAlso, he insists that I use the CC so that we get the rewards (as opposed to me just using my debit card)", "created_utc": 1702192320, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18exzsl/aita_i_told_my_husband_i_hated_him_over_my_dog/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But he's a heartless bastard isn't he? About half of our cats in the last 40 years have been put painlessly to sleep rather than have them suffer pain and distress. It's quick, gentle and clearly the right thing. But my wife and I, and our kids are in floods of tears, as is the vet. Our vets have a pay before you leave the surgery policy.

It sounds like resentment. \nNTA but (if you feel like, and after a time grieving) you should talk to him  and see where you all are. 6 dogs is not nothing, especially for someone who doesn\u2019t care about them, he sounds like he\u2019s fed up.", "NTA - your husband has been callous. I can not understand how a person can be so unfeeling as to say \u201cyou wanted Thor\u201d after finding out he is dying, as though he is worth nothing and his life doesn\u2019t matter.

YTA obviously, your poor husband must really love you and I can't imagine the (dog)shitshow he had to endure living with a pet addict for 20 years.

Oh.... and you're gonna help pay for them too\".", "YTA.

It's unfair of you to expect him to foot the bill from his personal funds for dog care", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing not to care about the dog(s) which still seems a little heartless, but I guess pets aren't for everyone. It's another thing entirely for him not to care about YOUR feelings about them. He knows Thor is important to you, but has decided that the money and the effort of caring for them is more of an issue instead.

It's possible for 2 people to like different things and still be together. He doesn't like dogs, yet he puts up with you having 6 of them. I'm not a dog person myself and my partner always takes care of his dog. If my partner asks me, I will feed the dog or even walk it. The dog is cute but I'm in no way attached to it. If it was gone one day, I wouldn't really care or care as much as to comfort my partner about it. Now back to your story. I do think that your emotional attachment to the dogs should be known to your partner and he probably should've given you some time to grieve. He has no obligation to love the dog but he should've been more understanding to your situation. Also you mentioned that money isn't an issue in your household.He definitely could've waited to sort out the finances later. If you had money problems and did that, I'd say YTA.  I think a good talk between you two should make things better.", "Esh I understand having to put your family pet down it's absolutely horrible and he is being horrible, But damn does he have any say in his house 6 dogs because you love animals but he's not a big fan so fuck him.", "NTA\nI\u2019m so sorry about your furry \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a I feel like it takes a different type of asshole to completely disregard an animal\u2019s life. I always vowed to myself to be with a partner who values furry lives, whether it\u2019s a family pet or a stray.

ESH", "ESH.  This man clearly isn't too thrilled with pets and you don't care about his wishes at all.  6 dogs is an INSANE amount of dogs.  1 maybe even 2 is reasonable but 6 is absolutely not.  Was he a jerk for what he said? Yes.  Was he a jerk for demanding recompense right away? Yes.  \n\nBut you're also a jerk for clearly not being willing to compromise on animals in the slightest.  I guarantee this issue is due to the fact that you can't stop yourself from constantly bringing animals home and he's incredibly resentful because of it.  \n\nIn one of your comments you stated that you were out with your child and just decided to get a puppy without even consulting him.

He\u2019s always been very petty about money, but given the situation I expected more from him, supportively. \n\nYou all wanted him: we were at a beach 12.5 years ago and these people had the cutest puppy. My kids and I asked if we could pet him and the people said they were wanting to give him away. My daughter begged me, and of course I relented. He was just 6 weeks old. By default (because I\u2019m the caretaker for all of the animals) he just attached himself to me, but I guess I\u2019m making the mistake (to some people) in assuming every animal you get when you\u2019re married with children is considered a family pet. \n\nI forewarned him that I\u2019d always have pets, not expertly him to take financial responsibility, but because having a pet is an important part of my existence).", "\"monitoring the shared account all the time\".....

No amount of therapy, fighting or ultimatums will move him into wanting to change.\n\nIt's not certain that your husband is a sociopath, but even if he isn't. If he's getting worse in how he treats you instead of better (since you said at one comment he's shown tact before), it's more than likely that this behaviour will continue if not worsen. Something you should consider while thinking about your family and especially your animals.", "It's not honey. He's an ass.  Now you know who he really is.", "Thank you, I will!", "As someone with dogs who are bathed regularly, you\u2019re correct they do have a stank, that person is just totally nose blind and has no idea and insisting they don\u2019t smell. It\u2019s funny. Go away for a week and get in your car you take your dogs in and it will smell of dog doesn\u2019t matter how often you wash them which really for most breeds shouldn\u2019t be more than monthly cause it dries their poor skin out completely", "Not with him, but at this point I make my own happiness.

Always be smart about it and don\u2019t be hasty.   I seriously wish you the best, you sound like a caring person.  Wait until your emotions are in check before making decisions.", "Are your kids happy? It doesn't sound like it, not at all, and you might make your own happiness but they are still dependent on you, and growing up in an abusive household (because that's what this is) is INCREDIBLY damaging. It sets them up for a future where, without serious intervention, they're in danger of repeating the same patterns they're witnessing right now. Kids model so much on what they see from their parents; that's also how they figure out what is and isn't acceptable. \n\nHow will you feel when it's your kid in a relationship like this? How will you feel when you realize they learned to tolerate abuse because of the way you let them grow up?"]}
