I had a rough journey since i transferred from another university and I lost few years because of that and now i'm graduating at 29 instead of 25/26 years old. For this reason, I always felt awkward planning any kind of party and always wanted to do something small with my closest friends and family.\r\n\n  \nMe and my gf have been together for 1 year and a half, she never wanted to be in a relationship, so we took things slowly and eventually we ended up together, but still she didn't like being called my girlfriend because of some her unresolved things. Since the very beginning of our relationship I\u2019ve always said her (joking at first, but being more serious once things took off) it would made me very happy having her during that day and she always said \"we'll see\" or sometimes even said yes.\r\n\n  \nSince two weeks ago I was very happy on how my life was going, I was happy about graduating knowing that she will be there, I felt loved and couldn't wait to see what's expecting me once I\u2019ll become a doctor and have finally the adult life I was dreaming since I was a child.\r\n\n  \nNow that the big day is arriving I invited a bunch of people from my university, my 2 best friends from my hometown (that's located 5 hours car drive away) and my GF that also lives in my hometown. As expected not so many people could be there for my day because it's a Monday afternoon and my two best friends are doctor too and very busy, also other friends from my university won't be attending that day and as a result during the proclamation there would be maybe 3 or 4 friends/colleagues who are there just because they\u2019re studying for their exams and this made me feel so lonely and sad.\r\n\n  \nMy gf on the other hand told me last week that for her was too much too handle, we argued and we decided to break up because she needed some alone time since, as she says, when she's in a relationship she's too comfortable to really focus on herself and solve her problems that makes her feel stuck and not going forward with her life.\r\n\n  \nDuring these days we've met more times and it always ended with us both crying, kissing and hugging a lot because we still love eachother. Yesterday have been our last time meeting and I asked her one more time to come to my graduation and I promised her that she won't be involved too much with my family since that's her main concern because that would make it too real and too scary.\r\n\n  \nI feel bad for her, but I feel even worse for me. I'm scared I won't be happy the day that should be my happiest because I already feel extremely lonely, I'll have to force smile taking photos with people that are there just for causality and meanwhile I'm coping with a very sad breakup knowing that we still care about each other.\r\n\n  \nAm I the asshole for asking so many times her to come at my graduation knowing that this would be the only thing that would make it a good day?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688822020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3z5q/aita_for_wanting_my_29m_gf_26f_now_exgf_to_be/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To yourself man. This is a girl that does not care about you. She's feeding you every excuse straight out of the book and you're trying to get her to be a person that she's not. You'd be better off in the long run to stop contact with her completely. That being said, congrats on getting your PHD! Remember, there's people that actually do care about you.", "Buddy, you need to just move on. She never wanted to be in a relationship in the first place, and all that you two are doing by seeing each other is causing more heartbreak. If she truly respected you and wanted to be with you, you wouldn't need to be asking her to join you on what just well be the biggest day of your life so far, she'd just be there to support you. With her saying she \"Needs to focus on herself\", it's clear as day she's saying she doesn't want anything to do with you. With you still running into each other you're just playing on both of your emotions. \n\nYou've graduated. Feel proud being what you've always dreamed of and move on. You'll find someone who wants to share these amazing moments instead of someone who keeps toying with your emotions. Congratulations on your achievements. Now is the time to be moving towards a bright future.", "It sucks you have to spend such an exciting time in your life focusing on your ex. She doesn\u2019t want to be with you. I\u2019m sorry, I know you don\u2019t want to hear it, but she doesn\u2019t. \n\nRefocus on what\u2019s important - YOU ARE A DCOTOR!! That is an amazing achievement, CONGRATULATIONS!!", "You are a doctor, age is just a number, not everyone has to do the things in the \"normal time\", and I am talking from experience, I only decided what I wanted to do latter in my life, and that's totally ok!\nNow regarding what you said, from what I understood you want something that she is probably not ready (as in not the right person for her or the moment itself) to give...and that sucks...wanting something from someone that they don't don't want or need from us is difficult to admit...but it is the reality...my advice is search for your happiness first, with your life and all, and then search for happiness with someone...I hope this can help you get through this moment with a new perspective!!", "YTA, because your delusional AF she\u2019s not your GF in fact it looks like at every possible moment and opportunity she told you she\u2019s not your girl friend. You said she never wanted a relationship and she didn\u2019t want you to be called YOUR Girl Friend. At every opportunity you didn\u2019t listen to her or respect her consent this is the time to respect her decision not to come. It sounds like you are just lonely because you focus on someone who openly told you they aren\u2019t your GF. My question is where y\u2019all exclusive? Because from what I\u2019m reading she told you y\u2019all aren\u2019t in a relationship so why would it be exclusive FWBs and before you deny that\u2019s what your relationship was friends that slept together except she wasn\u2019t your friend as they would show up to graduation. Block her and take the most important step of your life and find someone who ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND instead of coercing; persuade (an unwilling person) to do something by using force or threats, her to be your Girlfriend and going to your graduation", "Congratulations on graduating from med school!! You should be very proud of yourself. Your gf giving mixed signals on whether she will be there are huge red flags OP. She doesn\u2019t appear to be the one for you. I\u2019m sorry your heart is breaking but it will heal eventually. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis relationship sounds complicated, but it\u2019s understandable that you would feel hurt. You want people you care about to be there, so it\u2019s understandable. I hope you can enjoy your graduation anyway. Doesn\u2019t sound like this is your girl in the long term.", "Daiii!! Medicina in italia \u00e8 talmente tosta che io alla mia laurea intendo fare la festa grande quanto un matrimonio! Col covid e trasferimento ho perso anni, devo recuperare una marea di esami ed \u00e8 da dire! Medicina in italiano \u00e8 tosta! \n\u00c8 normale voler tutte le persone care vicine, dopo tanti sacrifici e neuroni sprecati! \nSei arrivato alla fine!

I completely understand that you want to have people that care about you at your graduation, but sometimes this isn't possible, which sucks of course. This doesn't mean you have to have a sad day. True happiness comes from within yourself. Don't try to rely on others, or external things, to make you feel happy, because this is always temporarily. If she had been there, you might have been happy for a minute, but the whole state of your relationship would make you sad again afterwards. You should focus on yourself, you did this yourself, nobody could have done all the tests etc for you. Your achievement is yours alone and the people you invited who are there or aren't there won't change this outcome. I graduated in a foreign country during covid and I had nobody there. Ofcourse I was a bit sad before the ceremony, but during and after I didn't really mind anymore. I knew the effort it took, I was proud of myself, and that made me happy! Thats all you need :). Nobody could change that feeling for me that day.", "NTA\nshe clearly has some really serious commitment issues she should solve on her own, you don't deserve to hurt because of it. \nGoditi la tua laurea, augurissimi dottore\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can be sad she won't be there, but you can't put that much pressure (saying the only way your graduation day will be a good day to be there) on her. Your happiness is NOT her responsibility.

Respect her boundaries and requests and leave her alone.", "Thanks mate, unfortunately the 3k letters limit didn\u2019t give me enough space to really explain in its depts out relationship, she is not giving me excuses, I\u2019m sure about it she is just being selfish for the first time since until now I had the relationship I\u2019ve always asked her and she always told me she didn\u2019t felt like to have. \nAppreciate the congratulations, I\u2019m not getting a phd im becoming a medical doctor (pointing just to clarify, sorry but my English sucks, maybe that\u2019s the reason I depicted her in such a bad way)", "I\u2019m moving on, I\u2019m not mad at her because she doesn\u2019t want to be with me, I\u2019m just overwhelmed by this situation and scared about what my feelings will be that day", "Harsh but needed.

This is worrying to me. I think that now the stress of studying is over you should take some time away from all romantic relationships and look at why you have such a need for someone else to make you happy.

She is only hurting you and seems to be okay with it. She only is upset that  has to be around your family, or do anything that shows she's in a relationship. It's really messed up that she couldn't put her irrational and cruel feelings aside to at the very least be a good friend to her bf and go to his graduation."]}
