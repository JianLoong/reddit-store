I though he was being nice but then he told me about the food we were eating, he frame it like he was warning me because he wanted to help me. He said that the jambalaya we were going to eat was from an old family recipe and it was really spicy but that if I didn't eat it or specially if I complain, their mom will be very offended and everyone would think I was a racist. I am white, my boyfriend and his family are black. Logically, I became really afraid.\n\nSo, when we were all sit on the table, I started eating but it was way worse than what I expected. I really tried, I keep eating but at some point I just couldn't tolerate it anymore. I started crying and everyone looked at me weird. My boyfriend ask me what was wrong and I tried to explain, while crying that it was too spicy and that I was so sorry while begging for everyone to not hate me. I realised his little brother was laughing. My boyfriend eat a bite from what I was eating and said that it was way more spicy that everyone else's portions.\n\nIt turns out it was all a prank by the little brother that talk to me early. He told me all those things to scare me and then put a lot of hot sauce in my plate. I went to the bathroom to fix my makeup from all the crying. I remain calm for a few more hours until we left. My boyfriend and I have been arguing about all this. Althought we both agree that what his brother did was bad (their mom promised me he would be punish severely), my boyfriend thinks that the way I acted wasn't great either. \n\nHe says that I should have said that my plate that too spicy and that the fact I didn't do it because of fear that they would think I was racist is cringe.

I'm glad that the rest of the family is not treating this as if it was actually funny, rather than cruel. \n\nI suggest that you call the mother directly. Apologize for reacting badly to the food, and thank her for dealing with the little brother.  Also, tell her that you're looking forward to trying the dish again, properly seasoned, as you're sure it will be good without the excessive hot sauce.", "NTA. If your boyfriend is genuinely aware of the fact that his little brother looked you in the face and told you his family would think you're racist if you didn't eat their food, and STILL says you didn't handle it well, then you should deeply rethink this relationship.

Only slightly though, except the little brother who is definitely an asshole for playing this prank.  BF is an asshole for saying the crying was too much and embarrassing, but he is right about the rest.  You seriously thought an entire family would be offended and think you were racist because a certain food is too spicy for you?  Why, because they are black and you are not?  Does that not seem insulting to you?  An 11y/o you have never met before gives you a warning and you trust him more than your bf, to whom you do not mention the conversation, nor do you mention your discomfort with the spice.  How quickly an 11y/o's warning made you jump to thinking he and his entire family are irrational is not good.", "NTA. You were already nervous and the little brother made that worse.

It is easy for him to think the way he does because he knows his family but you wanted to make a good impression, were put in a difficult position, and thought you had messed up. In any case, lest face it really spicy food does bring tear to your eyes.

That\u2019s your responsibility. You let yourself be gripped by irrational fear bc you didn\u2019t take it upon yourself to educate and familiarize yourself about another race.

The brother was awful to play that prank on you and i'm glad he will be punished. You could also have handled the situation better. If i was your bf's family i would feel insulted not because you can't eat spicy food but because you think i was shallow enough to judge someone by their spice tolerance.", "you believed an 11 year old boy spoke for the whole family?", "NTA That's a pretty messed up prank your bf's brother pulled. Also the fact your bf is downplaying the way you were treated and saying you over reacted os also very messed up.\n\nNext time he's dealing with something serious i wonder how he'd like it if someone said he's over reacting.", ">the fact I didn't do it because of fear that they would think I was racist is cringe.\n\nYeah, it is, because *you were told that is how they would react*. That is the cringe part. You were worried your boyfriend's family was going to negatively judge you because *you were told that is how they would react*.

Brother is a little punk, but he's a kid pranking his brother's girlfriend, not sure that puts him in AH territory. You're boyfriend overacted slightly but he was confused as to why you were crying, pissed at his brother, nervous cause his family was meeting his girlfriend, and upset that the lunch didn't go well. With all that boiling inside I can understand why he reacted like that. As for you, it is a little cringe that you would just blindly take the word of an 11 year old and not at least check with your boyfriend.

The little brother was a tool for doing that to you and if I can give you any advice it would be to just be yourself.  Ppl are ppl no matter their melatonin level so his fam was just looking to see the kind of person you are, not your tolerance for spicy foods.  Also, if you're an emotional person by nature, maybe invest in waterproof mascara.  I can see how meeting new ppl, especially family members, can be stressful or make you anxious because you do want them to like you and hope you all get along, but the most important person in that room was your bf. Personally, I would make my own plate or have my SO make it for me.  I'm peculiar like that....hope the brother got punished appropriately for doing that to you.", "NTA what a cruel prank", "NTA. If your boyfriend is putting any sort of blame on you in this situation maybe it\u2019s time to move on.", "NAH\n\nSorry, it's funny. The brother was playing off the stereotype that white people can't handle \"spice\" and like their stuff bland AF.

Yeah, she tried to show his family her good side and ended up crying because of the heat. \n\nNow, let\u2019s add the layer that is the race component. The kid dumbass told her the family would believe she was inconsiderate and racist if she didn\u2019t eat the food. \n\nBeing 18 made her naive and this didn\u2019t play out in the best light.
