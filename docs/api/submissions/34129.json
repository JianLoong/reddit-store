In the end it is your decision where and with whom you want to live. That being said, you will probably nevertheless feel bad because you can't support your friend the way you thought you can. Maybe you can try to help a bit in finding anew place for her or another roommate? Moving in with her in the first place has already been super supportive, beyond what many would be willing to do.", "NTA, the living arrangement doesn\u2019t work out anymore and you didn\u2019t have to but still gave her valid reasons why it won\u2019t. You feel badly for her because you are likely a good person with empathy for others, especially someone you live with whose woes you hear on a daily basis. \n\nBut I want to add: your room mate/ friend chose to rent an apartment with someone who she ended up breaking up with. She chose to take that chance of living with someone she hadn\u2019t lived with before. You stayed with her post-breakup to help, but it is now not working for you. She couldn\u2019t find anyone else, and needs to go where she needs to go until she can find a new place.  That is it. It\u2019s normal to feel for her, but you can feel for her and support her without sinking yourself. Do what\u2019s best for you first, always. Keep yourself healthy. \n\nAlso, putting yourself into what seems to be a triggering environment is not good either, her having to go to one shouldn\u2019t outweigh all of your reasons for leaving. Just make sure you\u2019re all good on any paperwork and don\u2019t give her a reason or chance to destroy your stuff, like saying how she acts makes you want to move (depending on how it\u2019s discussed)You never know how desperate people will act. You\u2019d hope you could work it out but your safety should come first, so make sure to be careful about what you say and how you say it.", "Nta. Her decisions are hers. She could have still moved but chose not too knowing she can\u2019t afford it on her own. Choosing to take care of you is not selfish nor is it something to place blame on.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for her or her triggers, and she shouldn\u2019t expect you to hold back your life. I\u2019m not sure what kind of triggering environment you\u2019re talking about, but unless she\u2019s in physical danger, you have no responsibility here. If she is in physical danger, it\u2019d be kind of you to help her find resources so she can be safe. Why can\u2019t she stay in her current apartment?", "NTA, however you could\u2019ve probably handled it better. You are allowed to put yourself first especially if it\u2019s your living space. However I think if this friend means a lot to you which it seems she does, help her find a new living space. You don\u2019t have to give up your freedom for other people, and to be honest it seems she should\u2019ve been more grateful. I think although this isn\u2019t an asshole move, you should at least attempt to get her into a somewhat better situation whether it be with another friend or another family member or condo.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
