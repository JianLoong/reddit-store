My father had it valued at the time and I have the valuation of $3,800. \n\nMy parents have since divorced (very nasty and lengthy custody battle- they do not talk and cannot be in the same room) and my mother never got along with my father\u2019s mother to the point where my grandparents didn\u2019t attend my parent\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s seems strange to me that she would want the ring. My mother said she \u201calways admired the ring\u201d. \n\nMy mother assured me the ring will come back to me in her Will so I don\u2019t need to charge her market value. She wants to pay the $3,800 valuation price. I said to her that we should get it valued again. I said I would pay for the valuation and she keeps pressuring me saying it will take time and money and just let her have it at $3,800 as she probably can\u2019t afford more than that. I said \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d and it blew up into a big fight and she said I\u2019m not wearing it and not enjoying it, it\u2019s just collecting dust in the safe. I didn\u2019t say this to my mum but I think my grandmother would not be happy with my mother wearing the ring. \n\nThe whole thing seems super weird and suss to me and I need other opinions as I am too close to this to get a read on it.\n\nUPDATE - thank you all for your advice and I have taken into consideration everyone\u2019s points. This situation was of such grave concern to me that while I had made my mind up not to sell it, to her or anyone, I teased out some further information from her on her intentions. \n\nI asked for her offer and she said $3,000 was all she could afford. Tried to tell me that diamonds have gone down in value since then which I told her absolutely not true due to their scarcity. I sent her links to show her that I knew she was trying to give me bogus information and I\u2019m not stupid. \n\nI told her I will get it valued for insurance purposes and I might repurpose it into earrings or another setting that suits me more so I can wear it and enjoy it. \n\nShe then tried turning it into trying to help me financially and I said that $3k doesn\u2019t really move the dial that much and some things are priceless and not for sale. She couldn\u2019t counter that signed off there. I\u2019m so sad she thinks I\u2019m so dumb and money hungry. \n\nThanks everyone for your support \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "created_utc": 1691317821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jmcht/aita_for_wanting_more_than_a_1998_valuation_for/", "score": 1005, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re NTA, for wanting a fair price for selling something, but this ring is deeper than that, and you shouldn\u2019t be selling it to Mom AT ALL. Plus, did you think of these? \n\nA) You Mom plans to sell the ring. First, she will buy it from you cheap ($3,800) and then sell it at current market value (probably close to double by my estimate) which allows her to pocket the difference and you won\u2019t ever know until she passes. \n\nB) She\u2019s doing this to get back at your father. \n\nThere is NO chance that she just likes a ring that belonged to someone who hated her. While that could be true for someone else, it\u2019s not possible for your mother because she\u2019s an emotional decision maker. No-she is hurting for money and and playing you. Plus, she does seem like the AH because you said you two got into a fight when you said , \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Is she always this narcissistic? She has no right to be anything but respectful to you about this. Why would throwing a tantrum work? \n\nYou need to probably tell your Dad about this right away.

She can't really guarantee that the ring will come back to you in her will. If she is planning on wearing it there is a possibility it will get lost.

I won't trust a word out of that woman's mouth.  If you sell it to her at $3800, you will never see that ring again. She will sell it and pocket the profits.", "NTA\n\nDon't sell to her.

To the point I would move the ring to a safety deposit box in a bank or take other steps to ensure the rings safety. \n\nI also strongly recommend getting a new detailed valuation and getting insurance on the ring.

You'll never see it again if she gets her hands on it.

Not even a little bit. Their entry into the market is very strictly controlled by De Beers specifically to manipulate their value. A very large part of their cost ties back to the number of \"brokers\" that are involved in moving them around the world. Cut out the people in the middle and watch the prices drop pretty quickly.\n\n\\- While diamond values have gone up over the years, they have just barely outpaced the rate of inflation. In other words, they are \"worth\" about the same in today's dollars as they were in 1998 in 1998's dollars. Diamonds as an investment don't really pay you back very much at all.\n\n\\- The value of \"the ring\" is not the same as the value of the stones set into it. And, by your description, there are multiple stones. A single larger stone will be worth more than two smaller stones whose combined carat weight equals that of the first one. Again, appreciation comes into play here.\n\n\\- Insurance valuations on jewelry are a joke. That $3,800 value was likely obtained specifically for insurance purposes and the ring would have had a retail value of maybe around $2,000. Every commercial or ad I remember seeing claimed their diamond was \"guaranteed to appraise for double\" because they were the ones writing the bogus appraisals as well. There isn't a chance that ring would have been purchased in 1998, even retail, for $3,800.\n\n\\- If you want to know how much the ring is actually worth, try and buy stones that are of equivalent size, shape, and quality. There are a couple of online companies that are pretty good (NOT BlueNile) to get an idea of what the stones might actually cost you. A setting for them can vary quite a bit, but gold would likely be around $500 or so.", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry this is your mother but it really looks like she knows something (or thinks she does) about the value of the ring and is trying to swindle you.", "What are the odds she could make a profit on it though?
