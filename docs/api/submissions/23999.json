My father had it valued at the time and I have the valuation of $3,800. \n\nMy parents have since divorced (very nasty and lengthy custody battle- they do not talk and cannot be in the same room) and my mother never got along with my father\u2019s mother to the point where my grandparents didn\u2019t attend my parent\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s seems strange to me that she would want the ring. My mother said she \u201calways admired the ring\u201d. \n\nMy mother assured me the ring will come back to me in her Will so I don\u2019t need to charge her market value. She wants to pay the $3,800 valuation price. I said to her that we should get it valued again. I said I would pay for the valuation and she keeps pressuring me saying it will take time and money and just let her have it at $3,800 as she probably can\u2019t afford more than that. I said \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d and it blew up into a big fight and she said I\u2019m not wearing it and not enjoying it, it\u2019s just collecting dust in the safe. I didn\u2019t say this to my mum but I think my grandmother would not be happy with my mother wearing the ring. \n\nThe whole thing seems super weird and suss to me and I need other opinions as I am too close to this to get a read on it.\n\nUPDATE - thank you all for your advice and I have taken into consideration everyone\u2019s points. This situation was of such grave concern to me that while I had made my mind up not to sell it, to her or anyone, I teased out some further information from her on her intentions. \n\nI asked for her offer and she said $3,000 was all she could afford. Tried to tell me that diamonds have gone down in value since then which I told her absolutely not true due to their scarcity. I sent her links to show her that I knew she was trying to give me bogus information and I\u2019m not stupid. \n\nI told her I will get it valued for insurance purposes and I might repurpose it into earrings or another setting that suits me more so I can wear it and enjoy it. \n\nShe then tried turning it into trying to help me financially and I said that $3k doesn\u2019t really move the dial that much and some things are priceless and not for sale. She couldn\u2019t counter that signed off there. I\u2019m so sad she thinks I\u2019m so dumb and money hungry. \n\nThanks everyone for your support \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "created_utc": 1691317821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jmcht/aita_for_wanting_more_than_a_1998_valuation_for/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re NTA, for wanting a fair price for selling something, but this ring is deeper than that, and you shouldn\u2019t be selling it to Mom AT ALL. Plus, did you think of these? \n\nA) You Mom plans to sell the ring. First, she will buy it from you cheap ($3,800) and then sell it at current market value (probably close to double by my estimate) which allows her to pocket the difference and you won\u2019t ever know until she passes. \n\nB) She\u2019s doing this to get back at your father. \n\nThere is NO chance that she just likes a ring that belonged to someone who hated her. While that could be true for someone else, it\u2019s not possible for your mother because she\u2019s an emotional decision maker. No-she is hurting for money and and playing you. Plus, she does seem like the AH because you said you two got into a fight when you said , \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Is she always this narcissistic? She has no right to be anything but respectful to you about this. Why would throwing a tantrum work? \n\nYou need to probably tell your Dad about this right away.

She can't really guarantee that the ring will come back to you in her will. If she is planning on wearing it there is a possibility it will get lost.

I won't trust a word out of that woman's mouth.  If you sell it to her at $3800, you will never see that ring again. She will sell it and pocket the profits.", "NTA\n\nDon't sell to her.

To the point I would move the ring to a safety deposit box in a bank or take other steps to ensure the rings safety. \n\nI also strongly recommend getting a new detailed valuation and getting insurance on the ring.

You'll never see it again if she gets her hands on it.

That value was likely the insured value.  Today it could be worth more, it could bring a lot less because older diamonds and settings tend to be worth less than modern ones on the secondary market, and the low price of popularity/availability of lab-created diamonds has many buyers avoiding \"blood diamonds\".\n\nOP should absolutely have the re-ring appraised for insurance since it's been 25 years, but her mother is thick as two planks if she's willing to pay $3,000 for it without a recent appraisal.", "She is trying to \"flex her muscle\" within your relationship. She wants something you have.  You are her daughter.  Therefore, you need to do as she asks.  \n\nJust tell her \"no\" and be prepared to see her true colors. She will tantrum, yell, and try to guilt trip you into doing what she wants.\n\nHold your ground, or your mother will continue to use and disrespect you.", "Would she go far enough to get it just to piss off your dad or go \"see MIL, it's mine in the end\"? But who knows if she's that spiteful.", "I miss my grandmother everyday. No amount of money can make me part with a piece of her.", "Nta. Your mother is full of it. She probably needs money.\n\nThat ring is worth at least half again what it was when it was valued.\n\nPut it in a deposit box at the bank & make sure she can't get hold of it.", "NTA, there is only one person that is dumb and money hungry.", "NTA - She is just going to sell it. Here in the USA, inflation alone has taken that $3.8k to over $7k. So either she's going to turn around and sell the ring or wear it to spite your father.", "\ud83d\udcaf and I\u2019ll add that if there was that much resentment towards her in-laws and now your father, she doesn\u2019t want you to have it.", "Appraised value and resale value are two different things. Even if it doubled in value from 25 years ago, you\u2019d take a big hit when you sell it. It\u2019s just a weird request on its face. Why not simply ask to borrow it occasionally. Why transfer ownership? Very suspicious", "Very good idea thank you this is fantastic", "Thank you for this", "This is a major turning point for me to be honest. It\u2019s up there with her worst behaviour of all time!", "Absolutely not!", "Yea, maybe she found out it\u2019s now worth a tens of thousands of dollars and figures you wouldn\u2019t mind giving her $20-30k if she gives you $4k now. You will never see the ring again.", "Has nothing about you changed since 1998?", "Yeah, but it the value is way higher now she can give you 3k and pocket the rest. Not so strange.", "Yes but then it was legally yours so she couldn't do anything. She wants to \"buy\" it now so she can legally sell it.", "you know your mother better than I do,", "If she gas bad behaviour in a regular basis why would you want to engage at all with her. I\u2019m a mom and I\u2019d never consider asking for this from me son.", "Yes it seems very weird to me. I\u2019m sad she thinks I\u2019m so dumb and money hungry!", "One could also argue that if there is any obligation it would be a sale/gift to the father of your family.", "I kinda want to know what it is worth!", "I did it. Answer = about $7,112.97", "Not the whole time. She had it in her safe before I moved out. As I was living with her after they divorced", "She knew about the valuation back then as they were still married.", "Yea I\u2019m so sad she thinks I\u2019m so dumb and money hungry that I would just turn over something like this!", "Op wasn\u2019t gonna \u2018think about it\u2019 that was her way of getting out of the conversation as otherwise mom wasn\u2019t gonna drop it. \n\nThis set off alarms for op, she knew it was fishy but she also knows her mom and likely knows that she wouldn\u2019t just take no for an answer.\n\nNTA- the ring is yours. It was left for you. If your grandma wanted your mom to have it she\u2019d of given it to her.\n\nGiving or selling it to her would be disrespectful to your grandmas wishes- also I\u2019m 100% certain mom just wants it to sell or to piss off your dad (or both).", "You might be onto something here!", "Yes, it's just a baseline, but it gives a good indication to OP how unreasonable it is that they go with the 1998 valuation.", "You sure it\u2019s not already sold and she\u2019s trying to stop you from learning that it\u2019s gone?", "You can take it in to a local jeweler. Look for one with one on staff, not a chain store. Tell them your story. They are usually the coolest people and will give you a ballpark idea of what you\u2019ve got.
