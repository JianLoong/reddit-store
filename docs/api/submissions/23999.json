My father had it valued at the time and I have the valuation of $3,800. \n\nMy parents have since divorced (very nasty and lengthy custody battle- they do not talk and cannot be in the same room) and my mother never got along with my father\u2019s mother to the point where my grandparents didn\u2019t attend my parent\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s seems strange to me that she would want the ring. My mother said she \u201calways admired the ring\u201d. \n\nMy mother assured me the ring will come back to me in her Will so I don\u2019t need to charge her market value. She wants to pay the $3,800 valuation price. I said to her that we should get it valued again. I said I would pay for the valuation and she keeps pressuring me saying it will take time and money and just let her have it at $3,800 as she probably can\u2019t afford more than that. I said \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d and it blew up into a big fight and she said I\u2019m not wearing it and not enjoying it, it\u2019s just collecting dust in the safe.

And then she'll tell you something like \"you didn't even use it, I thought it was OK\".\n\nIf you do sell it, have it evaluated first and sell it full price.\n\nHowever, if you want to sell it I'd do it to someone else entirely. She wants to spite your father's family. You know your grandma wouldn't want her to have the ring. She gave it to you directly. And you know your mother didn't like her so there's no emotional reason for her to want the ring. Well, at least not a good emotion.\n\nWhatever you decide to you, make sure it's what you want to do. Don't do it to please your mother. Don't do it thinking you'll get the ring back.\n\nEdit: I saw in another comment that you find it weird she may want to sell it because she had previous access to the ring.

You\u2019re NTA, for wanting a fair price for selling something, but this ring is deeper than that, and you shouldn\u2019t be selling it to Mom AT ALL. Plus, did you think of these? \n\nA) You Mom plans to sell the ring. First, she will buy it from you cheap ($3,800) and then sell it at current market value (probably close to double by my estimate) which allows her to pocket the difference and you won\u2019t ever know until she passes. \n\nB) She\u2019s doing this to get back at your father. \n\nThere is NO chance that she just likes a ring that belonged to someone who hated her. While that could be true for someone else, it\u2019s not possible for your mother because she\u2019s an emotional decision maker. No-she is hurting for money and and playing you. Plus, she does seem like the AH because you said you two got into a fight when you said , \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Is she always this narcissistic? She has no right to be anything but respectful to you about this. Why would throwing a tantrum work? \n\nYou need to probably tell your Dad about this right away. Make sure she doesn\u2019t have access to any of your stuff, & and tell her flat out and clearly that you don\u2019t plan to sell your grandmother\u2019s ring to her and that you don\u2019t want to discuss it with her again so she is not to mention it any further.", "NTA. She can't really guarantee that the ring will come back to you in her will. If she is planning on wearing it there is a possibility it will get lost. If she pays a fair price you shouldn't care if it is returned to you anyway. It seems like she wants to buy it off you for cheap and sell it for a profit.", "NTA.  I won't trust a word out of that woman's mouth.  If you sell it to her at $3800, you will never see that ring again. She will sell it and pocket the profits.", "NTA\n\nDon't sell to her.  It almost sounds like she's trying to get you to sell to her at a low price so she can resell it for a profit.", "NTA. If you give it to her you will never see it back. It is yours and yours alone, you do whatever you want with it. Just one thing. If your mum has a key to your house, put it in a secure deposit box, she will come and steal it from you otherwise.", "NTA\n\n*So very, very suspicious*. To the point I would move the ring to a safety deposit box in a bank or take other steps to ensure the rings safety. \n\nI also strongly recommend getting a new detailed valuation and getting insurance on the ring. Also recording the type and quality of gemstones and if there are serial numbers recording those too. There\u2019s a very high chance that your mom intends to remove the gemstones from the ring and replace them with fakes", "NTA. I would get it valued so i can see what Mom thinks she\u2019s getting from it\u2019s sale.", "NTA. Do you want to sell the ring? I agree that the whole scenario sounds off, but if you don't want to sell the ring then you don't have to sell the ring. Period.", "NTA\n\nIt is your ring now and there is no reason to give/sell it to your mother.  If you do, you will never see the ring again.", "NTA to want the current valuation of your ring if you were to sell it. If you were to sell it there would be no guarantee you\u2019d ever get it back even with your mother\u2019s honest intention to bequeath it to you in her will.  (Could be stolen, lost, sold, etc.)  It\u2019s not a bad idea to get the valued again for insurance purposes whether you sell it or not. If you don\u2019t want the ring nor do you want to preserve it for your daughter if you ever have one, then sell it", "NTA but don't let your mother anywhere near that ring.  You'll never see it again if she gets her hands on it.  It doesn't take a lot of time or money to have a piece of jewelry appraised.  \n\nIf your grandmother wanted your mom to have the ring, she either would have given it to her when she was alive or she would have left it to your mom in her will.", "NTA for wanting the current market on an heirloom you inherited from your paternal grandmother Red Alert here,  it's weird for your mother to try to profit at your expense.  This is your ring now, and what you do with it is none of her business. \n\nEdit: grandfather to grandmother, spelling", "NTA.  This isn't about the selling price of the ring, really.  There is no guarantee you will get it back once you sell it.  I would bet money that your mother wants to buy the ring cheap and then resell it just to spite your father.", "NTA!\n\nShe is definitely planning to do something to really piss your dad off. It\u2019s probably one of the last ways she can hurt him. He may also think you\u2019re complicit and that would hurt him too I\u2019m sure.
