The past three have started at 10:30PM and ended sometime after 3AM. \nI\u2019m actually writing this on New Year\u2019s Day at nearly 2:30AM. The party is still going and if anything the music (and the weed) have gotten louder. I get wanting to have fun, and I don\u2019t want to come off as a jerk or anything, but there\u2019s a limit. After his first party, he was nice enough to leave a note on everyone\u2019s door in the building with his number so we can text him any complaints. We found the note and texted him (anonymously of course) and asked him to chill out. I\u2019m very pregnant and and my fianc\u00e9 works early morning shifts. Needless to say, we both need our sleep. He turned down the music for maybe 30 minutes and when he turned it back up it was louder than before.\nI can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m already sleep deprived just from being pregnant and the parties are certainly not helping. Before anyone says anything, no, this isn\u2019t about expecting people to accommodate my choices. It\u2019s about common courtesy. Slamming doors, heavy feet, moving furniture, vacuuming, etc. are average things you can expect in an apartment.

I started calling the police (after asking them on a handful of occasions to turn it down and they gave me the middle finger) and getting a copy of the noise report so I can hand it into the leasing office. Needless to say that the leasing office didn't care because they paid their rent on time. So I ended up moving out instead.\n\nI would first check your lease for a \"noise clause\". I would then, during the time when they aren't blasting music, go to your neighbor, knock on the door and explain the situation. That your pregnant, that your fiance works early mornings and you're being sleep deprived by the loud, constant music. If that doesn't solve it, then bring it up to management. If you have a \"noise clause\" in your lease, ask them to enforce it. If they don't, start getting the police involved and get receipts so you can prove (if you need to move out and want to break the lease) that you are no longer comfortable living at the property.", "NTA. It's one thing if he's playing music at 6 PM, but 3 AM? That's just obnoxious. There's no way he doesn't realize he's annoying his neighbors, he just doesn't care.

You can do it alone or with other neighbours who are also being affected by this person\u2019s partying. Written complaints for every time the noise is unreasonable, establishes a pattern and provides evidence for your landlord should they need to bring legal action against the DJ tenant. Audio/video evidence can help support that your right to reasonable enjoyment of your home is being infringed on.\n\nIf your landlord doesn\u2019t do anything, call the cops about the noise. Another option is calling the fire department if there are a lot of guests - capacity limits on 1b apartments are definitely lower than the club and there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll shut down the at home rave if there\u2019s an excessive number of people inside. Just don\u2019t call 911, use the non-emergency numbers.", "NTA. I had this once with a neighbour and it was a total head wreck. Report, report, and keep reporting.", "While he is definitely the asshole, you would be a bit of an asshole if you reported him at this point.\n\nOne text is not really anything. You can just walk down like an adult, and talk to him, letting him know that it is a problem. There's no reason to jump straight to \"I'm going to try and get him evicted.\"", "NTA. If they are out of order the police should be called as soon as possible.", "In a case like this, you may be entitled to withhold rent. \n\nIn most places, there is an implied covenant of \"quiet enjoyment\" in leases. \"Quiet enjoyment\" does not literally refer to silence, but rather to undisturbed use of the premises. Still, unabated noise probably precludes undisturbed use of the premises. Have a quick consultation with a lawyer.", "One text absolutely puts him on notice that the neighbors object to the noise.", "If he doesnt want to get evicted, maybe he can try not being an ass to others?\n\nHe knows the loud music disturbs people, he doesnt need a message to tell him that", "Nope. He knows he's offside with one text. \n\nFrankly, he knew he'd be offside from the moment he moved in. There's no need for politeness in the face of such intransigence.", "Okay sorry\u2026. I see you\u2019re trying to play devils advocate here, but what I\u2019m getting from your thread is that having a loud party with a full DJ setup in an apartment building until 3AM is essentially okay and neighbors should have to go out of their way to explain why it isn\u2019t? Also, if you would like the details of the text, it stated that we could hear everything going on, the reasons why we needed rest, and we requested that he at least turn the music down to a reasonable volume. And yes, it was only 30 minutes before it was turned back up. Let me ask you, if he isn\u2019t willing to work with us and accept the complaint via text as he requested, why would he accept a face to face conversation? I also want to point this out since you\u2019re talking about being adults, isn\u2019t part of being an adult being responsible, respectful, and having common sense when living in close quarters with other people?", "In my case, my lease didn't have anything relating to noise at all. It was 1 building with 4 apartments in it. Two upstairs and two downstairs. The leasing office was hired by the owner to run it and they told me they legally can't do anything unless the owner says they can. After speaking with the owner, the owner said he didn't care because they paid rent on time. So I told the leasing office that I was moving out then and breaking my lease. If they filed a bad report on my leasing history or try to keep me in contract, that I'll hire an attorney. Luckily it didn't resort to that and I moved out within weeks. \n\nBut OP, this is good info that you should definitely consider!", "In my area, it's not an implied covenant. It's explicit in the standard rental terms of every agreement (and our legislation.)", "Quiet enjoyment is more around not having the landlord on your doorstep all the time, trying to talk with you/spy through your curtains.", "So what is wrong with going down and having an adult discussion with him exactly? It's entirely possible that he doesn't realize how loud he's being, one text could have just meant that particular night. They could go down and actually explain the situation and find him totally receptive and apologetic.", "How can you determine that from a single post that someone else made? You don't know who the person is or anything about him other than that he's played loud music, and been told a single time that it's kind of annoying. \n\nIt's entirely possible that they could come downstairs and say \"hey look, I'm pregnant and your music is really screwing up my sleep, could you please keep it down\" and have him say \"Oh hey I didn't realize it was that bad I'll do better from now on.\"\n\nJust seems really judgmental to make a decision based on a single text with someone you've never even met", "Why do you assume that? You don't know that", "That isnt what I said at all.\n\nAll I'm saying to do is just walk down and have a normal conversation. Why is everyone treating this like I'm asking you to invite him over for dinner and make him a full Christmas meal? It's just a conversation. If he refuses, then report him.", "Because the text puts in in writing. If you ever have to litigate this matter against him, or (more likely) against the landlord, conversations (\"adult\" or otherwise) can be excluded as hearsay.\n\nAdditionally, whether the text means \"only that particular night\" depends on what the text says.", "When you play really loud music all the time, what happens?", "If he has a DJ system it's not an assumption. By design it's loud enough to shake walls and floors. I used to live in a concrete building that had two floors shaking every weekend from some jackass with a fantastic DJ system. \n\nHe's an asshole, and he knew he would be.", "I guess we can agree to disagree, but there are certain things that shouldn\u2019t require a conversation. I could accept a child being loud at an unacceptable hour because they don\u2019t know any better. A full grown adult shouldn\u2019t need someone to tell them to their face that having a party until 3AM in an apartment is unacceptable. That\u2019s just something they should know.", "Wtf are you talking about litigating? I'm talking about being a normal, adult human being, literally no one has said anything about ligitation. \n\nNormally, if an adult has a problem with another adult, they will go speak to that person and see what can be done to resolve it with a polite conversation. That's what, you know, being an adult entails. You still have not provided any reason why they can't just walk downstairs and have a friendly chat.", "I have 40% hearing loss, so I have no idea what would be loud to other people.", "Again, you're making assumptions. You have no proof of that. That's why you go down, act like an adult, and talk to them. If they tell you to fuck off then you can go report them.", "Whether you think that or not, that's still not a reason not to do it. \n\nIf you can resolve the situation yourself, you should always try to do it before doing something that has the potential to harm someone else, unless they're an actively malicious or evil person. I don't consider making noise to be a reason to get someone evicted, and I would consider you an asshole for trying to make someone homeless over an issue like this. Sorry.", "Because -- while it is not impossible that he has failed to realize how loud he has been -- the more likely scenario, particularly having already been asked once, is that he continues the noise, which in turn may allow OP to withhold rent if the landlord fails to take action.\n\nIt's about creating a paper trail.", "You haven't provided any reason why they should, when all of the tenants in the building sign the same agreement, and the neighbour knows damn well he's offside from the get-go. A DJ system and \"he doesn't know how loud he is?\" Bullshit.", "You can guess whats loud to other people.\n\nAnd if you get a message AFTER you placed your number for complains, thats your queue to stop.", "Sure you do. If you can feel the walls vibrate it's too damn loud.", "We will continue to disagree. I have lived this more than once; nowadays, I don't bother to speak to the other resident more than once. After that, it's the police every damn time, because every damn time the resident knew how loud they were being. They just didn't care who they screwed over with their noise.", "Yikes. You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions. I\u2019m not trying to get him evicted, and chances are the apartment manager wouldn\u2019t jump straight to eviction anyway. The issue is that he clearly didn\u2019t care when his neighbors asked him to chill, but hopefully he would listen if the apartment manager was aware of the situation.", "That still isn't a reason NOT to talk to him.", "Please stick to one reply to me, there's no need for multiple. Or for you to get so angry and start cursing at me.", "And they clearly said he did stop that night. They claim that he turned it up louder later, but we have no proof of that.\n\nAnd once again, why can they not just walk downstairs and have a friendly chat with him?", "I'm not the one making assumptions. I'm literally asking you to just go talk to him and not make the assumption that he won't listen. For some reason you are refusing to do something that takes 30 seconds, could easily fix the issue, and won't hurt anyone. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Has society really gotten so antisocial that talking to another human being that happens to be your neighbor is a huge burden?", "Meh, if you're allowed multiple comments, so am I.", "We dont have proof for anything in this sub, so you know,we go by the details here. We can also say there is no proof of the neighbour existing.\n\nThey can go have a chat, but the message should have been enough- it was his request afterall", "I'm talking to different people. Not spreading replies to one person across multiple comments to try and make them do extra work to respond.", "You're just making assumptions though.\n\nIf the text just said \"hey could you turn it down a little?\" It's perfectly reasonable to expect it to be a one time thing.\n\nThey have not said anywhere that at any point they've messaged or made him aware that this is a recurring issue, so it's entirely possible that he thinks, since no one is saying anything to him, that they don't have a problem with it.", "Yeah for only 30 minutes. And we go by the post.\n\nI dont know, where i am from its common logic to not have very loud parties especially late in the night cause they disturb people."]}
