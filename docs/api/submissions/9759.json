Just for next couple month while I\u2019m on crutches. \n\nHe got so angry and told me it wasn\u2019t a big deal and I just need to get better handling my crutches or go upstairs. \n\nThis is just bizarre to me and totally outta character for him.

This is all a new thing since I\u2019m in crutches - not likes it\u2019s been happening before. \n\nSo - It\u2019s water from OTT hand washing. I have some wounds and stitches from surgery and injury, and he\u2019s terrified and disgusted by risk of infections.  \n\nIt\u2019s all triggered some very old OCD stuff that he was too grossed out and embarrassed to say.

What if he is actually leaving the floor dry but there's a slow leak around the base of the toilet? It might be a N A H situation then.", "NTA, this is a reasonable request.

I know people that wash their hands in such away that it looks like they washed an uncooperative dog in the the washbasin, for whatever reason, they just can't not soak the place.\n\nEither way, he's in his forties and still can't clean up after himself? Is he just skipping that part of his life, i.e. we can't clean up as babies and we can't clean up as very old people, but he's just not going to bother for any other time period of his life either?", "NTA. I have no clue why men can't wipe up the floor after! My BF is amazing, except for this one thing. He'll even get piss all over the floor two minutes after I mopped! He insists that he always looks and never sees anything. \n\nI'll never understand why they can't just clean it up.", "NTA, he needs to grow up and stop losing on the floor.", "NTA. That's really bizarre. I can't think of how he could be doing that. Did you ever notice him do that before you broke your leg?", "hpow theufck do you soak a floor", "NTA. He sounds like a catch", "NTA.  Your husband needs to either get his act together and start wiping up his messes, or just use the upstairs bathroom.", "NTA! I broke my leg as a teenager and was on crutches for 3+ months during the winter. I fell pretty hard one time in the kitchen because someone had tracked in some snow. I had increased pain in my leg and had to go to the doctor the next day to have X-rays to make sure the bones were still aligned properly. The bones had shifted, but, luckily, not enough that the doctor had to remove the cast and reset the bones. I had been in my cast about 3 weeks at that point and it would have sucked if I had had to start over the long healing process. I could have also majorly hurt myself; head injury, another broken bone, joint injury, etc. After my fall, everyone was very careful about not tracking in snow and wiping up any water that happened to get on the floor. \n\nYour husband is risking your health by his selfish behavior. You need to protect yourself and having your husband use a different bathroom is an easy solution. It might help if you point out to him how a fall could set back your current healing and could cause additional injuries. I hope you heal quickly and you are NTA.", "Nobody is that forgetful. He's 100% doing it out of spite, especially if he doesn't usually do that with the upstairs bathroom.\n\nNAH.", "NTA at all. So some guys need help and refuse because pride. there's these aim stickers on Amazon that you can put inside the toilet. \n\nI know a friend of mine that uses them for training her kids but her husband has recently stopped pissing on the floor too \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af hope it works for you.", "If I were OP, I would already have put signs on the wall above the toilet and sink and on the inside of the door saying, in LARGE, BOLD, UNDERLINED, ITALICIZED letters (all caps, of course): ***DRY THE FLOOR BEFORE YOU LEAVE.***\n\nI would (at first) be kind and not add ***YOU THOUGHTLESS JACKASS*** at the end. Unless he *still* didn't do it, and then I'd revise the signs.\n\nBut that's assuming he genuinely \"forgets\"; if he's actually just being incredibly cruel, that's a whole different problem.", "Gross. He should clean up after himself. Also bad aim when urinating can be a sign of an underlying medical issue (e.g. diabetes).", "NTA. This is so strange and gross, OP. I have young kids and I make them dry the floor (from water, they'll fling their hands instead of drying them on the towel) if they get it wet, and it's like a few drops. A grown man should be capable of doing better. (My husband never gets the floor wet.)\n\nBut rather than hurt yourself further because of your husband's whole \"I could care less about you\" attitude, I would also suggest leaving a towel on the floor. Just leave it there. He can soak that with his gross pee/water, and you can be safe.\n\nAlso, he has to know where the liquid is coming from...", ">Your husband should be trying to make your life easier not harder\n\nIt's heartbreaking how many husbands show their true colors when their wives get sick or injured.", "My dad was a terrible shot. My brothers learned that was acceptable behaviour.

He sounds like a massive prick.", "I feel like, even if he's not at fault for the wetness and it's actually an undiscovered plumbing issue, he's still TA for refusing to use the upstairs bathroom to accommodate OP. True that him going upstairs wouldn't solve the wetness issue in that scenario, but at least they'd know he wasn't actually doind it! Plus it's just so little effort on his part to help his laid up spouse. It feels super inconsiderate of him to fight about this rather than just agreeing to help her out.", "Key difference here being that they are actually children, unlike OP\u2019s husband who is just pretending to be one.", "Ah, the kind of level-headed response I expect from this sub.", "Then he should find out so she isn't injured.  It could be an issue.", "I was coming here to say this! Is the toilet leaking? For there to be enough liquid to actually slip on...

OPs update actually show the husband had some underlying issues, so it's a good thing she didn't leave him over this lol.", "It doesn't take much to make crutches slippery. But yes, I had a toilet leak around the bottom seal. And would be quite a bit actually.", "Eh, I'm *very* absent-minded, and routine small things easily escape me. But that's why I use reminders.", "Ok, but if peeing all over the bathroom floor is a routine small thing, he should see a neurologist", "There could be a leak somewhere, it seems bizarre that the floor is getting wet every time like this."]}
