Telling anyone to \"back off\" your romantic partner is fundamentally an insecure and controlling thing to do unless you have concrete evidence that they're having sex.

Certainly not getting high with you or expecting you to be her wingwoman at bars and clubs anymore.\n\nInstead of taking what you're willing to give, which was always going to tone down once you were partnered and your life partnership became your priority, she acted like a child.

This doesn't even scratch the surface of the things she used to do but she was honestly very horrible and started a new drama every two days just for the fun of it.
