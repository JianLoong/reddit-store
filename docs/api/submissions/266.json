Does the apology benefit them or benefit you?\n\nTo that ends, I would ask what the point of confronting your father other his affair would be, and why you would spill the beans to your siblings.  Are you trying to be vindictive, so you think it will help you mentally to have it off your chest, do you think it\u2019s important enough for you siblings to know or are you trying to hurt your father?\n\nThe reasons behind *why* you want to out this secret determines if you\u2019re the AH or not.", "YTA. If you need to talk to your dad about the impact his actions had on you, that's between you guys. But insisting he tell your siblings just seems like sour grapes. Their relationship is theirs. Focus on your relationship with your father instead of trying to control how others perceive him.", "NTA mostly, but I think you need to reconsider your approach.  I understand the need to confront him, but you discovered the cheating at least eight years ago so it sounds like confrontation would look like it came out of left field.  Worst-case scenario if you make it a big thing is that he overreacts because it looks like you're starting a fight before a vacation.\n\nI recommend trying to keep it as non-confrontational as possible.  Something like \"I wanted to let you know that I know about your affair and I don't want to have any interaction with her side of the family on this trip if at all possible.  I can't guarantee there won't be an angry outburst, which neither of us wants.  If we are forced to be together, I suggest you tell my siblings about the affair before they learn about it during my angry outburst.\"\n\nSelfish AHs need to think you're putting them first.", "Nta but unless you have proof or dad admits to cheating on your mom with her your step siblings are not going to believe you. You waited far to long and nos to a lot of people is just going to look like if you were being a brat throwing a tantrum that dislikes his step mom for no reason. \n\nI say the best to approach this is have a sit down 1 on 1 with your dad were you come clean tell them you know about the cheating (dad will most likely deny). Then you come clean about your feelings that you will never see her or her family as your family and that you dont want to go on the trip. Your 23 he cant force you to go. \n\nThe real issue are your siblings. If they have no clue your dads wife is/was his mistress and they like her then they will not believe you unless you have proof and would probably give you crap about not going on the trip then youll have to either a) come up with a good excuse as to why you didnt go. b) tell them the truth and see were the domino fall depending on their reaction. c) tell them you dont want to go because you dont and will never see her as family and thus are not interested on spending time with her or meeting her family and ask your siblings to respect your boundary. Ultimately youll have no control how they react to any of those options though.", "YTA\n\nHear me out: it's been a decade. The only person allowed to hold a grudge is your mother. Cheating is wrong, and it's understandable to be upset that your parents divorced. But if he wasn't a shit father otherwise - you should take this up with a therapist. Your parents would've divorced anyway.", "I think u WBTA, it\u2019s been 8 years since they\u2019ve been married what waiting a few more days/weeks/months going to do? U will ruin or possibly get the whole trip cancelled and cause a lot of tension for a nearly decade old secret\n\nAnd what are u planning to get out of confronting him? It\u2019s already done and they\u2019re divorced now\n\nAlso do u have proof to back up ur claim, if not I wudnt recommend going thru with this at all or ur just going to end up being the bad guy trying to ruin their relationship and everyone will think ur lying", "YTA-- you say that your siblings don't know about the affair.  What have they done to you, that you would hurt them with your \"confession\"?  \n\nYour timing also needs work.  Don't go on the family trip, or confront your dad (alone) and then don't go on the family trip.  Doing this right before your family trip will drag unnecessary drama into everything.\n\nYou should probably run this idea of yours past a trained therapist.  You're holding a lot of resentment, and you need help to get through it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
