Don\u2019t get your hopes up that she will see it the way you do. Have you met him? Has her family? Someone should at least meet the guy....", "NTA for your concern but I do feel like alot of people forget that sometimes just bc people are overly clingy, doesn't mean it's any sort of toxic. Stupid? Probably but this is the time frame my partner of 2 years and I worked on at first too so I can't judge too much really. But if they're both perfectly fine with this dynamic maybe just sit back and let her have her first experience. If it blows up in her face then she's learned an incredibly valuable lesson but if it doesn't and they work out and you express this, they will 100 percent later down the line bring it up again", "You're NTA but you risk alienating her at this point in the relationship by offering unsolicited advice, no matter how well meaning and correct. It's also a bad idea to leap from her parents' home to his without living on her own for awhile.", "NTA for voicing your concerns to her. She may want you to mind your own business, though, so if you really want to help, step carefully.", "NTA but your approach will have the opposite effect to what you want , and could further push her away. Just be there for her , so that if your fears become true she is not isolated from everyone", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Young love is what it is, and she has the right to learn her own lessons.", "Info: Why would she be isolated if the relationship fails?", "And ill further add that if you see any truly toxic controlling or abusive behavior then yes step in. But as of right now it sounds like the honeymoon phase.", "This. NTA, but I know from experience that if you confront someone about their SO they usually become defensive and shut you down. Maybe show your support for her instead (ie telling her you're there for her, etc)?", "I totally agree, there's no toxicity at present, I just feel like she doesn't know what 'normal' is and from the outside, it appears far too intense to be normal for a 24 year old...if that makes sense? She already is quite a needy person and my main fear is that this type of honeymoon phase is not going to be beneficial at all for her anxiety and for her separation anxiety.", "I met my bf in May of 2020, got pregnant (accident, my BC failed) in July, and moved in with him by the first of September. We had a very rushed timeline due to the baby and many of our friends and family had the same concerns as you did. And while they weren't needed I do understand. I just want you to view it from her perspective that this could just be how she is and what she wants in a man yknow? I'm a very fast paced person myself, and I only slow down if it's been made clear I need to (I don't push boundaries though ofc and I make it clear that I'm a steamroller so boundaries should be set beforehand). Some people are just like that and it works for them usually when they find seone who exudes the same energy. Honestly as it stands right now, it sounds like your sister found someone who matches her emotionally! Hold your reservation til if and when it blows up", "I am also someone who at 24, has emotional attachment and diagnosed attachment disorder so im very clingy and intense too, and if they're ok being that type of support then that's fine! Just maintain a role in her life so if it does get crazy, she isn't completely isolated"]}
