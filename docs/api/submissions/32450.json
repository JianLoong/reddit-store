He\u2019s using the reservation he had for you to take someone else.", "Nta. He knew you wanted to go there. He knew he wouldn\u2019t want to eat there twice yet he chose to go there. Making plans with you just to cancel them and go to dinner with different people at the same place he was going to take you. That\u2019s not thoughtful at all.", "I was prepared to say you were in the wrong right up til where I read that he won't go back to the same restaurant again. This makes you NTA while he seems rather selfish and inconsiderate. Also, if he's going to the same restaurant at the same date why not go together? Sure, you and your boyfriend might have to sit at different tables and not with the family friends if it's that kinda place, but you could still hang out before and after. Your bf could have solved this in so many ways, but he dropped the ball.", "NTA, it\u2019s annoying that he invited you to a place you really wanted to go, then apparently decided he was taking family friends instead (why not give you the reservation and take them elsewhere?).", "NTA sounds like he made plans with you, then \u201ccancelled\u201d them due to a conflict.

That\u2019s not what a good boyfriend does.", "He is going with someone else and don't want to look bad for restaurant crew.  \nE: NTA", "That's a bit crap on his part.. \nTake yourself and a friend and have a good night and sack the boyfriend off.. \nHe could have at least invited you to the meal too seen as though you really wanted to go!! \n\nHe's the AH not you!!", "INFO: Is he using the reservation he made for you and him to take the family friends instead?

If they do, go by yourself and eat at the bar\u2026 also see if you can get reservations for yourself.", "Yikes. You def have a right to be upset. Going to the place you really wanted to go with someone else is a low move", "NTA. You are not the asshole in this situation. You expressed your excitement and desire to go to the restaurant with your boyfriend, and he initially agreed to it, making you happy. It's completely understandable that you were disappointed and upset when he canceled the reservation to have dinner with his family friends, especially when you found out he planned to go to the same restaurant without you. It's reasonable to expect that he would have considered your feelings and included you in his plans, especially since it was something you both had looked forward to. Your frustration and disappointment are valid.", "It is like you saying you really want to travel to a specific country, and then he goes without you before you have a chance to go together.   I would be careful though.  Did you communicate your excitement about going to this restaurant with him clearly enough, or do you think that you suggesting it repeatedly should have implied your excitement without you having to say it?\n\nMen see the world differently than women do, and chances are if you went to a restaurant he was excited to go to before going with him, he wouldn't really care and either go again or find a different restaurant.  Is there clear communication about how you expect him to act when you intend to try a restaurant together?\n\nYou do have the right to be upset and disappointed though.  If he indeed knew that going without you would hurt you, he is either inconsiderate to the way you feel, or he doesn't pay enough attention to the things you say.\n\nNTA, but perhaps jumping to the conclusion that it makes him an inconsiderate bastard is a step too far without further inquiry.", "NTA... going anywhere with a significant other is more about spending time together than it is the location at which that time is spent. If he cared about you he would think about the significance of what this means to you and the fact it is the same place twice wouldn't even be a factor.", "NTA-Boyfriend sounds like an inconsiderate doofus.", "NTA\u2026hmmmm, same restaurant?   I think not.   What I would do is tell boyfriend, \u201cno problem!  I\u2019ll take our reservation and go with a friend and you can still hang with your friends!\u201d.   See what he says to that.  I bet it is not what you want to hear.", "NTA, I think it's kinda AH of him to cancel on you just because he doesn't want to \"go to the same place twice\" (it's not like they only have one item on their entire menu??) but I suspect he's lying to you as well\n\nMaybe the stars just aligned or something but I find it hard to believe that he got two apparently hard-to-get reservations at the same restaurant on the same day, both around dinner time, and he just happened to forget about that other one until a few days after booking yours. Then for whatever reason \"cancels\" without even asking you if you still want to come?\n\nIs he using the same reservation for someone else? There might be some info missing here", "Yes, what\u2019s good for him can work for you too.", "That was also my first thought.", "He had plans with them first", "Yeah, how hard is it to call your friend/restaurant and ask if they could add another cover ?\n\nIt sounds like bf just wants to try this restaurant not alone, gf or not", "I hate to be the cynical person.\nBut something sounds weird. \n\n\"The restaurant just opened up,\" meaning what... a month ago? Two months ago? It can't have been much more than a few months since it's \"just opened\" Unless OP expresses themselves with the wrong choice of words. \n\nThe reservations are incredibly hard to get. Okay. So far, I'm following\n \nOP wants to go there and mentions a few times. \nBF manages to make reservations. But still haven't remembered he had plans already on that exact date? \nIn a fairly new, very hard to get a booking, restaurant. The name isn't ringing any bells.\n\nAnd out of the blue, he cancels. \nThe family friends have reminded him (????) Or he remember They have dinner there. At the exact same day. \nAnd won't go before in several months. \n\nEither the boyfriend has a very.....very bad memory and doesn't use his calendar system. Or something is off here.", "It\u2019s 5 months away\u2026", "Because boyfriend dropped the ball and didn't realize this was an easy solution", "How is this ESH? Is she not allowed to feel disappointed?", "Yeah no, that's not how relationships work. Also, while she's upset by the fact that he's going to the exact same restaurant she's particularly upset because her boyfriend also states that he has no interest in revisiting the restaurant at a later day because he doesn't want to visit a place twice. If _that_ doesn't come across as entitlement I don't know what does.", "Actually, anyone gets to hold anyone to a promise they made. \n\nBoyfriend promised her one plan. He forgot that he\u2019d already made other plans. That was *his* screw-up, and if he couldn\u2019t find a way to merge the two plans, then he owed it to OP to make it up to her by rescheduling their original plan. By refusing to do *either* of those things, he has communicated that he does not take his plans with her seriously. And a person who does not take their plans with you seriously is unreliable and disrespectful. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re married, dating, casual friends, or colleagues. This is obnoxious behavior on boyfriend\u2019s part that would annoy *anyone* in OP\u2019s shoes.", "There is a difference between being entitled and just having feelings. To some people it is actually important to do 1st things together with the most important person to you.", "You know what I would do? I would get myself a nice reservation there and than go with my best friend and leave his sorry ass at home. Treat yourself!", "I disagree with you stating he was refusing to reschedule. He explicitly stated he was going to make it up to her by taking her for their 2 year anniversary. Additionally, she said this place was extremely hard to get a reservation at, as evidenced by her attempting to get a reservation and being unable to. It's not out of the realm of possibility that the plans already made by someone else could not be edited and even if they could she isn't entitled to force her way into his families plans anyways just because she's a foodie and really wants to go. Whether he tried or not is another matter completely but to just crucify him and glorify her is just another example of reddit bias against men and for women lol"]}
