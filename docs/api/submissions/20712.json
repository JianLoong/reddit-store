They even had my half sister Katie in that time. But right after Katie was born, their marriage changed. Neither wanted a traditional marriage and weren't in love with each other, as both were still devoted to their late spouses. So they stayed married but chose to go by companions instead.\n\nThey slept in separate rooms. Did family things individually from each other except for with their shared child. Janet was not part of my brother's or my life really and dad was the same with her three kids. They would act like friends more than a couple because in reality that was what they were. They said they also saw it as lessening the potential burden on their kids one day.\n\nFrom an early point both had made it clear that if they were to pass, they would want to be buried with their first spouses.\n\nKatie struggled a lot with the dynamic. Now that her mom is gone, she is fighting for her to not be buried with her first husband so she can be buried with dad when he goes (dad has become unable to care for himself due to early onset dementia). Janet's other kids said no way and she goes in with their dad, who she loved, who was her real spouse. Katie asked me to help her talk them around and I told her I would not do that. That when dad goes he'll be buried with mine and my brother's mom, like he wanted and like we'd want too.\n\nKatie told me it's not fair. It's like she doesn't matter in any of this. She told me I'm supposed to help her and support her in this and I'm refusing. That when she dies she'll end up being buried alone (she has often talked about never wanting to marry or have kids) and she won't be able to be buried with her parents and it isn't fair. I tried to offer her comfort but she told me I wasn't helping her change the plans and I could fuck off.\n\nShe's 19 and has suffered a huge loss so I am being compassionate as I can be.

Or she could get cremated and her ashes could go in the grave of her father and her mothers. Because she is part of both familys. I think most important is at the moment to be there for her and let her have the feeling that she isn't alone. Neighter now in live nor in death one day. Would it be possible to bury something of your father with your step mother? Like their wedding ring, some necklace they shared, a amulet with a photo of your sister, her mother and father together?

I don't think you're wrong at all to insist on it.  It's what they told you they wanted and presumably everyone but Katie is okay with it.\n\nKatie probably won't spend eternal death being sad and lonely because her corpse isn't rotting where other family members rotted, frankly.  But she is feeling abandoned and diminished while she's still alive. \n\nCould you offer to let her be buried near either parent or by you and your family?  Maybe she'd like her ashes spread somewhere nice instead of burial with anyone?\n\nIf none of that makes her feel better than just listening and being kind and understanding  but firmly saying you're going to honor the stated wishes is all you can do.

However, my heart does go out to her, she is a product of what is in effect a loveless marriage, having parents who were/are devoted to the memories of their first spouses. That must be very hard for her to deal with. Her mother being buried along side the love of her life, makes her feel alone, and isolated, especially as it highlights there is a significant chunk of her mother's life of which she was not a part. As you've said she has struggled with the dynamics of her family and her parent's marriage.\n\nTherefore, try and be gentle with her, especially as she is only 19 years old and due to lose her other parent, your father. Maybe suggest burying a keepsake from their marriage in your father's coffin when it is sadly his time, or a photo of the three of them, if there is one, be placed in Janet's coffin, providing her older children agree. There is also the probability that her name may not be mentioned on her mother's headstone, thus making her feel more excluded - I admit, I'm overthinking here. Speak to her maternal half siblings, and see if there is a solution to make her feel more included and acknowledged as having been a part of her mother's life. \n\nKatie may have have half-siblings but if she is not close to you all, I'd say she must feel very, very lonely, especially as she approaches her 20s with hardly a parent to guide her in the early part. I appreciate you may not have that bond with her, but again, try and be gentle.", "Imagine having emotionally distant parents for 19 years if that happened to me I\u2019d be in a very dark place mentally this is an extremely crappy situation but you should be there for her even if you disagree with her ideas of how the burial should go", "Poor Katie, she really has been failed by all her family, especially her crappy parents.", "Janet's kids would never agree to Katie going in alongside their dad and my brother would never want her alongside our mom. I feel weird about it too but if I thought he'd agree it would be fine by me. I can't speak as to whether Janet's kids would allow something from the second marriage or something to symbolize Katie's family (Janet, dad and her). That would be for her to ask because I have not seen or spoken to them in more than fifteen years.\n\nPart of the issue is we were never a family. Even when they had a more conventional marriage, we were not truly a family in that time. No relationships with the other side were really forged in that time.", "They never really did see the potential fallout. The whole arrangement between them was hard on Katie. They were also mostly thinking of their individual children in a lot of it and not her.", "They are buried in different cities as well as different cemetery's. So no, I don't see moving them together as an option but I'm pretty sure that would never have been agreed to anyway.\n\nI pretty much know Janet's kids won't have anything more to do with her. They already don't. My brother doesn't really have anything to do with her either. Katie and I aren't that close either but I kept in touch.", "Janet's kids would never agree to that kind of thing. They have no relationship with Katie and I think this is the last contact any of them will ever have with her.\n\nI am doing my best to be gentle given the complicated circumstances we're dealing with.", "My heart breaks for Katie. She won\u2019t be able to be buried with either of her parents?\n\nNo partner or children by her own decision, fair enough.\n\nBut no parents or siblings, god that\u2019s rough.", "This is so awful.  You all are being downright cruel to Katie.", "This is where I find the siblings to be the ass.  You are saying she can't be buried next to her mother or her father?  I understand wanting to have your parents together as that is their wish, but you all need to accept that she is just as much your dad and step mother's child as you all are. And she has just as much right to be buried near her parents as you all would", "This is why I was reading the comments before saying anything. Poor Katie is this \"oops\" child who was never really part of either family. That's 1000% on you dad and step mom. If they had married and then decided on the \"companion\" relationship and not truly blending the families without having a kid, that would be fine. But once they had her, there was a responsibility to do some blending.\n\nSo I have to say NAH because your step mom is dead and your dad is not really present mentally.\n\nI hope that you might be able step up a bit and develop a real relationship with Katie. I can understand why she has decided never to marry or have kids considering her odd upbringing, but she is only 19 and feels utterly alone in the world. Let her be angry and get that through her system, and then support her in getting some counseling as well (if she isn't already).\n\nAs for when she goes, suggest cremation and then scattering or burying half the ashes on each grave with a marker at each one - but she will need to make sure to have someone in her life who can honor those wishes as it's likely she'll be the last surviving child of either of her parents.", "Still the same. No one\u2019s in the wrong. And this is a crappy situation. \n\nEncourage Katie to get counseling though.", "I know it doesn\u2019t have much to do with the post, but is there a reason none of you have much to do with Katie? She\u2019s pretty young to have such a terrible history with everyone that no one talks to her much.", "Yikes. That is somewhat unkind of them, especially as they are in effect pretending their half sister doesn't exist, all to create some fantasy. Their mother remarried, they need to acknowledge that, not rewrite history at the emotional cost to Katie. \n\nWould you agree to having a keepsake buried with your father etc? I appreciate you want to respect his wishes re being buried next to your mother, but she has already been rejected by one side. If not would it be worth, as a compromise, having a small memorial organised for Janet in a few months time, and one that will be centered around Katie, so that she can have some sense of belonging, and be able to say a proper goodbye? It doesn't need to include the maternal half siblings, seeing as they don't seem to acknowledge her existence.\n\nI appreciate you are trying your best to manage the emotions of a 19 year old, whilst having to face your own pains,, especially if you don't have a strong bond, and you may not be in much contact in the future, however, Katie will never forget your kindness, as she certainly won't forget her other half sibling's cruelty. If ever anyone of you need her in years to come, she certainly will not be there for those who rejected her.", "Janet's kids never liked that she was born. Can't speak for them as adults. It's been a long time. My brother always struggled to see her as a sibling or as our family. Me and dad were his family, mom had been his family. Katie never fit for him. I think the age gap played a role for me. As well as just often times dad would not bring Katie when we'd meet up and I never made the effort to figure out when she'd be free to spend time with me/us.\n\nShe and I talk the most for sure. I stayed in touch. When she got old enough I would call and text her and we'd DM when that became more of a thing.

With such a big age gap and little time spent together, I guess I can't really blame your brother for not being closer to her and it sounds like you've made some effort to build at least a basic relationship with her, which is nice. But damn. Sounds like you and she are about as close as casual friends, a step above acquaintances maybe? Her mum's dead, her dad has dementia and her other siblings somehow resent her very existence?! No wonder she's grasping at this weird grave thing. Sigh. Her focus on the grave thing is weird and pretty pointless, but I feel for her. I hope she's able to build more ties, maybe get some chosen family to be close to alongside her relationship with you. She hopefully has a long life ahead of her; I hope she's able to focus more on getting the most out of it that she can and less about mooring herself in an afterlife that she's probably fantasizing about fulfilling her childhood wishes for family.", "It sounds as if your brother and all her other sibling are trying to pretend she does not exist, do inform her that she will have some legal rights about being included on the gravestone and if she wants her ashes buried with her mother and father they and your brother would not have legal right to stop that as along as it is framed legally that that way but it sounds as like for all her life you and all her sibling have been asshole to her and you at least seem to reliase this fact and are trying to be better so be better and help her deal with her grief and do support her on the matter of allowing her ashes to be spilt amongst her parents graves that is something you should help with even if your brother does not want that as it will be the right thing to do and she has as much rights on this matter as your brother does.", "NAH. I can't say a 19-year-old who lost her entire family because her parents made a strange dynamic.

I feel sympathy for Katie but it's a moot point if your parents put this into a legal document.", "NAH. I will say the level of dysfunction and toxicity your dad and his second wife created in your family dynamics is terrible. I understand why at 19 Katie wouldn't want to ever have a partner and kids! Especially if it means her gmail dynamics will be anything like what she grew up in. Talk to your brother bc at this point why does full filling the wishes of the dead supersede the wishes of the living?
