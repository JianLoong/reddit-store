{"id": 15788, "submission_id": "1303rne", "title": "AITA for telling members of my cooking class not to eat bad food?", "selftext": "Throwaway account. I (46M) am taking a cooking class. It's an adult education class for beginner cooks, and focuses on knife skills and basic cooking principles. I've been cooking my whole life, and came from a family that cooked a lot, but I never learned the proper gourmet techniques. Most of the people in my class only cook occasionally. There is one young woman (20s?) who says she barely cooks at all. During the first class, we were asked to state our skill level and what we hoped to get out of the class, and she said \"my family never cooked\" and \"I always thought cooking was a stressful activity, and I want to make it a fun activity.\" Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nThe first day, I noticed that this girl had the burner on way too low for her soup. I turned it up for her, and explained that food won't cook unless it's hot (she didn't seem to know). I also brought over all of her ingredients so she wouldn't have to run around panicking when it came time to blend in her herbs. She thanked me, but moved her ingredients further down the table away from me. I thought it was rude, but didn't dwell on it.\n\nAt the next class, she was supposed to be melting chocolate, which is one of the easiest things to do. I noticed that her chocolate was starting to melt in the pot, but that she was getting a drink from her water bottle. I immediately turned her burner down and called her over, just to explain how food sometimes needs to be watched and things can happen very quickly. Again, she was moody and rude. \n\nFinally, at our third class, she was actually one of the students put in charge of the entree. Up until now, she had been making appetizers and desserts, which people in the class can choose either to eat or ignore. But it's expected that everyone will at least try the entree. \n\nI was, of course, really concerned for my classmates. I didn't want anyone to get sick or to eat something disgusting. While we were cooking/serving ourselves the different courses, I hovered around the entree and tried to make casual comments like \"that doesn't look completely fresh to me\" and asked her what help she needed. The main course was fish, and I didn't think that an inexperienced cook like her could safely serve the dish to everyone else.\n\nSo before eating, at the end of each class the instructor asks us what we learned from each day. I was already frustrated from dealing with this girl that could barely cook at all, so I answered honestly \"don't trust someone who can't even boil soup to bake a salmon!\" \n\nMost people chuckled, but after the girl got upset, some folks came up to me afterwards and said that I should have given her food a chance. I disagree, because I think people can actually get sick from eating bad cooking, and this girl shouldn't have agreed to cook for everyone if she was this poorly skilled.", "created_utc": 1682553190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1303rne/aita_for_telling_members_of_my_cooking_class_not/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s already admitted to feeling stressed in the kitchen, and you are going out of your way to make things as *stressful as possible* for her.

Then I reread the first line and realized that you aren't the teacher. \n\nSo why are you acting like you outrank another student?\n\nYou act like you've been helping her out, but you've just been arrogantly interfering in her learning process. You think her stove is at the wrong temperature? You should have kept your hands to yourself and either told her that you believed it should be higher or you should have minded your own business and let the teacher give her guidance.\n\nYou assume she will get flustered by gathering her own ingredients? Even if you were right, that's all the more reason for her to try to do it herself, so she gets the experience. Instead, you prevented her from having that learning experience in a really arrogant and condescending way. Of course she moved her ingredients away from you! She wasn't being rude, she was responding to your inappropriate interference and trying to politely distance herself.\n\nAnd then, after all of that, you made fun of her in front of the class. If you genuinely believed there was a safety issue, you should have said something *privately* to the teacher.\n\nYTA.", "Believe it or not young women don't always want a middle aged man to take over everything they do.

Next time take a class that matches your self-assumed skill level. She is a true beginner that knows nothing. You are not the instructor.

Maybe if you get off your high horse you\u2019ll actually learn something. Back off that girl so she can learn something too (and not from you). Part of learning is trial and error.  She\u2019s allowed to learn her own way without you butting in. And I\u2019m sure the instructor wouldn\u2019t allow the students to eat something that would make them sick. Ugh you\u2019re\u2026something, aren\u2019t you?", "YTA - it\u2019s a class for beginners. She\u2019s a beginner. If your cooking skills are more advanced than a beginner then take a more advanced course.", "YTA. You were a student in a beginner's class; you shouldn't be critiquing anything.

But instead you would butt in without her asking or wanting the help. Was her soup not gunna boil and undercook the ingredients in it? Oh fucking well, but now she knows for next time.

This is a grown woman not \u201ca girl\u201d.  That itself is insulting, patronizing, and degrading..

Get over yourself.", "You are mad at someone who has never cooked? Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. No one enjoys being around the self appointed classroom monitor.

You're interfering with the class.", ">Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nActually, it is.  If you want to be insufferable, go cook by yourself instead of shaming beginners for being beginners.  YTA", "Let her have fun. Jesus.

You managed to not do a single one of those things.", "YTA. And melting chocolate IS hard you wanker.", "YTA. You overstepped - the teacher is in charge.

I don't think she notices that the other people are not being appreciative, but are tolerating her, but it always turns out by the end of term that most of them have distanced themselves. OP, YTA for your superior attitude. For example, with the soup, why would you adjust the burner for her rather than just advising her that she may want to give it more heat? I'm pretty sure she at least knows how to turn up a burner. And I'm also pretty sure she doesn't appreciate you watching her every move. You are not the instructor. Does this \"girl\" ask for your advice? And if the instructor isn't ensuring that the food is safe to eat, perhaps you should look for a different class.

Gross.\n\nTurning something down if it's burning and alerting the person is fine in isolation, but I'm not surprised she reacted badly given how you've acted. She probably feels like you're constantly watching her. Like have you noticed anyone else's mistakes or are you just focused on her?\n\nAnd the fish thing.

Also, speaking as someone who's taught beginner cooks, your advice was incredibly contradictory and confusing (you have to use a high heat for food to cook at all, but then another day your heat is too high you'll burn the chocolate?? You can't blanket statement like that in the first place and expect her to know you only meant to use high heat in that moment as the dish warranted it, but in reality balancing heat is a delicate artform that takes practice to know how to weild properly so sometimes it should be lower). \n\nYou're not the instructor, and thank fucking god for that since your method seems to be condescending people who \"know less than you,\" and then mocking them when their final product didn't meet your high standards.

I (46M) am taking a cooking class. It's an adult education class for beginner cooks, and focuses on knife skills and basic cooking principles. I've been cooking my whole life, and came from a family that cooked a lot, but I never learned the proper gourmet techniques. Most of the people in my class only cook occasionally. There is one young woman (20s?) who says she barely cooks at all. During the first class, we were asked to state our skill level and what we hoped to get out of the class, and she said \"my family never cooked\" and \"I always thought cooking was a stressful activity, and I want to make it a fun activity.\" Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nThe first day, I noticed that this girl had the burner on way too low for her soup. I turned it up for her, and explained that food won't cook unless it's hot (she didn't seem to know). I also brought over all of her ingredients so she wouldn't have to run around panicking when it came time to blend in her herbs. She thanked me, but moved her ingredients further down the table away from me. I thought it was rude, but didn't dwell on it.\n\nAt the next class, she was supposed to be melting chocolate, which is one of the easiest things to do. I noticed that her chocolate was starting to melt in the pot, but that she was getting a drink from her water bottle. I immediately turned her burner down and called her over, just to explain how food sometimes needs to be watched and things can happen very quickly. Again, she was moody and rude. \n\nFinally, at our third class, she was actually one of the students put in charge of the entree. Up until now, she had been making appetizers and desserts, which people in the class can choose either to eat or ignore. But it's expected that everyone will at least try the entree. \n\nI was, of course, really concerned for my classmates. I didn't want anyone to get sick or to eat something disgusting. While we were cooking/serving ourselves the different courses, I hovered around the entree and tried to make casual comments like \"that doesn't look completely fresh to me\" and asked her what help she needed. The main course was fish, and I didn't think that an inexperienced cook like her could safely serve the dish to everyone else.\n\nSo before eating, at the end of each class the instructor asks us what we learned from each day. I was already frustrated from dealing with this girl that could barely cook at all, so I answered honestly \"don't trust someone who can't even boil soup to bake a salmon!\" \n\nMost people chuckled, but after the girl got upset, some folks came up to me afterwards and said that I should have given her food a chance. I disagree, because I think people can actually get sick from eating bad cooking, and this girl shouldn't have agreed to cook for everyone if she was this poorly skilled.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s there to learn. It\u2019s a beginners course.

But what I don\u2019t get (maybe someone could help me out here) - why was OP worried, people might get sick? Normally, the ingredients are provided if you take a cooking class, right? So if the stuff they used was old then it wouldn\u2019t be the woman\u2019s fault. Sure, worst case she doesn\u2019t cook the fish right and it ends up raw (or it simply tastes bad) but with salmon it\u2019s pretty easy to tell the difference between raw and cooked, right?
