It's an adult education class for beginner cooks, and focuses on knife skills and basic cooking principles. I've been cooking my whole life, and came from a family that cooked a lot, but I never learned the proper gourmet techniques. Most of the people in my class only cook occasionally. There is one young woman (20s?) who says she barely cooks at all. During the first class, we were asked to state our skill level and what we hoped to get out of the class, and she said \"my family never cooked\" and \"I always thought cooking was a stressful activity, and I want to make it a fun activity.\" Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nThe first day, I noticed that this girl had the burner on way too low for her soup. I turned it up for her, and explained that food won't cook unless it's hot (she didn't seem to know). I also brought over all of her ingredients so she wouldn't have to run around panicking when it came time to blend in her herbs. She thanked me, but moved her ingredients further down the table away from me. I thought it was rude, but didn't dwell on it.\n\nAt the next class, she was supposed to be melting chocolate, which is one of the easiest things to do. I noticed that her chocolate was starting to melt in the pot, but that she was getting a drink from her water bottle. I immediately turned her burner down and called her over, just to explain how food sometimes needs to be watched and things can happen very quickly. Again, she was moody and rude. \n\nFinally, at our third class, she was actually one of the students put in charge of the entree. Up until now, she had been making appetizers and desserts, which people in the class can choose either to eat or ignore. But it's expected that everyone will at least try the entree. \n\nI was, of course, really concerned for my classmates. I didn't want anyone to get sick or to eat something disgusting. While we were cooking/serving ourselves the different courses, I hovered around the entree and tried to make casual comments like \"that doesn't look completely fresh to me\" and asked her what help she needed. The main course was fish, and I didn't think that an inexperienced cook like her could safely serve the dish to everyone else.\n\nSo before eating, at the end of each class the instructor asks us what we learned from each day. I was already frustrated from dealing with this girl that could barely cook at all, so I answered honestly \"don't trust someone who can't even boil soup to bake a salmon!\" \n\nMost people chuckled, but after the girl got upset, some folks came up to me afterwards and said that I should have given her food a chance. I disagree, because I think people can actually get sick from eating bad cooking, and this girl shouldn't have agreed to cook for everyone if she was this poorly skilled.", "created_utc": 1682553190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1303rne/aita_for_telling_members_of_my_cooking_class_not/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s already admitted to feeling stressed in the kitchen, and you are going out of your way to make things as *stressful as possible* for her.

Then I reread the first line and realized that you aren't the teacher. \n\nSo why are you acting like you outrank another student?\n\nYou act like you've been helping her out, but you've just been arrogantly interfering in her learning process. You think her stove is at the wrong temperature? You should have kept your hands to yourself and either told her that you believed it should be higher or you should have minded your own business and let the teacher give her guidance.\n\nYou assume she will get flustered by gathering her own ingredients? Even if you were right, that's all the more reason for her to try to do it herself, so she gets the experience. Instead, you prevented her from having that learning experience in a really arrogant and condescending way. Of course she moved her ingredients away from you! She wasn't being rude, she was responding to your inappropriate interference and trying to politely distance herself.\n\nAnd then, after all of that, you made fun of her in front of the class. If you genuinely believed there was a safety issue, you should have said something *privately* to the teacher.\n\nYTA.", "Believe it or not young women don't always want a middle aged man to take over everything they do.

Next time take a class that matches your self-assumed skill level. She is a true beginner that knows nothing. You are not the instructor.

Maybe if you get off your high horse you\u2019ll actually learn something. Back off that girl so she can learn something too (and not from you). Part of learning is trial and error.  She\u2019s allowed to learn her own way without you butting in. And I\u2019m sure the instructor wouldn\u2019t allow the students to eat something that would make them sick.

But instead you would butt in without her asking or wanting the help. Was her soup not gunna boil and undercook the ingredients in it? Oh fucking well, but now she knows for next time.

This is a grown woman not \u201ca girl\u201d.  That itself is insulting, patronizing, and degrading..

Get over yourself.", "You are mad at someone who has never cooked? Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. No one enjoys being around the self appointed classroom monitor.

You're interfering with the class.", ">Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nActually, it is.  If you want to be insufferable, go cook by yourself instead of shaming beginners for being beginners.  YTA", "Let her have fun. Jesus.

You managed to not do a single one of those things.", "YTA. And melting chocolate IS hard you wanker.", "YTA. You overstepped - the teacher is in charge.

I don't think she notices that the other people are not being appreciative, but are tolerating her, but it always turns out by the end of term that most of them have distanced themselves. OP, YTA for your superior attitude. For example, with the soup, why would you adjust the burner for her rather than just advising her that she may want to give it more heat? I'm pretty sure she at least knows how to turn up a burner. And I'm also pretty sure she doesn't appreciate you watching her every move. You are not the instructor. Does this \"girl\" ask for your advice? And if the instructor isn't ensuring that the food is safe to eat, perhaps you should look for a different class.

Gross.\n\nTurning something down if it's burning and alerting the person is fine in isolation, but I'm not surprised she reacted badly given how you've acted. She probably feels like you're constantly watching her. Like have you noticed anyone else's mistakes or are you just focused on her?\n\nAnd the fish thing.

Also, speaking as someone who's taught beginner cooks, your advice was incredibly contradictory and confusing (you have to use a high heat for food to cook at all, but then another day your heat is too high you'll burn the chocolate?? You can't blanket statement like that in the first place and expect her to know you only meant to use high heat in that moment as the dish warranted it, but in reality balancing heat is a delicate artform that takes practice to know how to weild properly so sometimes it should be lower). \n\nYou're not the instructor, and thank fucking god for that since your method seems to be condescending people who \"know less than you,\" and then mocking them when their final product didn't meet your high standards.

I (46M) am taking a cooking class. It's an adult education class for beginner cooks, and focuses on knife skills and basic cooking principles. I've been cooking my whole life, and came from a family that cooked a lot, but I never learned the proper gourmet techniques. Most of the people in my class only cook occasionally. There is one young woman (20s?) who says she barely cooks at all. During the first class, we were asked to state our skill level and what we hoped to get out of the class, and she said \"my family never cooked\" and \"I always thought cooking was a stressful activity, and I want to make it a fun activity.\" Great! But that's not what everyone else is here for.\n\nThe first day, I noticed that this girl had the burner on way too low for her soup. I turned it up for her, and explained that food won't cook unless it's hot (she didn't seem to know). I also brought over all of her ingredients so she wouldn't have to run around panicking when it came time to blend in her herbs. She thanked me, but moved her ingredients further down the table away from me. I thought it was rude, but didn't dwell on it.\n\nAt the next class, she was supposed to be melting chocolate, which is one of the easiest things to do. I noticed that her chocolate was starting to melt in the pot, but that she was getting a drink from her water bottle. I immediately turned her burner down and called her over, just to explain how food sometimes needs to be watched and things can happen very quickly. Again, she was moody and rude. \n\nFinally, at our third class, she was actually one of the students put in charge of the entree. Up until now, she had been making appetizers and desserts, which people in the class can choose either to eat or ignore. But it's expected that everyone will at least try the entree. \n\nI was, of course, really concerned for my classmates. I didn't want anyone to get sick or to eat something disgusting. While we were cooking/serving ourselves the different courses, I hovered around the entree and tried to make casual comments like \"that doesn't look completely fresh to me\" and asked her what help she needed. The main course was fish, and I didn't think that an inexperienced cook like her could safely serve the dish to everyone else.\n\nSo before eating, at the end of each class the instructor asks us what we learned from each day. I was already frustrated from dealing with this girl that could barely cook at all, so I answered honestly \"don't trust someone who can't even boil soup to bake a salmon!\" \n\nMost people chuckled, but after the girl got upset, some folks came up to me afterwards and said that I should have given her food a chance. I disagree, because I think people can actually get sick from eating bad cooking, and this girl shouldn't have agreed to cook for everyone if she was this poorly skilled.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s there to learn. It\u2019s a beginners course.

Don\u2019t eat it if you think it could make you ill OP and if you truly think it is dangerous for others then tell the instructor discreetly.", "This is like a textbook definition of mansplaining lmfao", "I'm missing the part where you said you were the instructor.\nBecause unless you were, NONE of what you said or did was warranted. YTA, a huge arrogant one.", "Like you?  That's what has your panties in a wad, OP.  You weren't given the responsibility of being the star of the class and you're angry about it.  Grow up!\n\nYTA.", "That wasn\u2019t your decision to make. You overstepped.", "If you're such a great cook why are you in a beginner class?\n\nOh wait.....I think I know. \n\nIt's a beginner class. She is where she needs to be. If you are so confident in your cooking then drop the class.", "I refuse to believe that you lack so much self-awareness that you typed this post out, reread it, and thought yes, this is it, I am clearly not the AH in this situation.", "But yet, a cooking class for beginners is for people to learn how to cook. You are wanting to take that ability away from her and create a hostile environment is an asshole move. \n\nGo take college classes instead of acting like an asshole towards people in a beginners class because they aren\u2019t up to your strange standards.", "/u/BuildingDull397\n\ndo you realise that you not only harassed and mocked one of your fellow students, but also the teacher? you basically said that the instructor of the class couldn't make competent decisions \n\nand told all of us that you didn't trust the instructor of your cooking class in terms of food safety. because if you think a dish that the instructor helped her prepare was going to be dangerous to eat, you're saying that the instructor is so incompetent that you can't eat their food\n\nif you were in my class, I'd kick you out", "So\u2026the instructor assigned the responsibility to someone who wants to learn and helped and supervised along the way. It\u2019s a class. If everyone knew how to do it, there wouldn\u2019t be a class! \n\nAnd the instructor probably realized that OP was a master chef and did not require such basic experience. /s. And it\u2019s hard to ruin a salmon.", "Oh there is an instructor? And it isn\u2019t you? Weird.", "Dude, it's a cooking class. The literal reason she (and you, supposedly) is there is to learn. She's not going to become more competent if a creepy middle-aged guy keeps butting in and trying to \"fix\" her mistakes.   \n\n\nPlease leave the class. Nobody wants you there. YTA so very much.", "Dude. Literally no one wants to be around you.", "The instructor is responsible for determining what may be served, and teaching how to check for doneness. You are a nosey-parkering, self-important, interfering person who has made the class less pleasant for everyone else there.", ">She helper her during the process, but the responsibility should have gone to someone more competent.\n\nShould I explain the concept of a course/class for you? You don't seem to understand it...", "For someone that thinks so little of her- you spend a looooot of time around her.  Watching her, noticing her etc.  lil creepy- you have a thing for her?", "I would really like to see Gordon tear OP a new one.", "I love that you charged him an AH tax with the discount. He earned that privilege!", "Yeah cause that happens all the time /s", "Duh?", "I'm so confused as to why he thinks that this adult education class for \"beginner cooks\" focusing on \"knife skills\" and \"basic cooking techniques\" is the place to learn gourmet techniques. He claims to cook a lot but everyone else in the class rarely/occasionally cooks? Makes zero sense", "Act like a creepy old man, get called an old man. Seems fair to me.", "It is when he wants to call this woman a girl just because she is 20something and berate her every five seconds like he is her daddy. He wants to act like an old man, he will get called an old man.", "He's old enough to be her father, and he's creeping on a 20yr old and berating her for not being a skilled cook, in a beginners cooking class. Seems like \"old man\" territory to me", "That\u2019s a clear as day signal that she\u2019s not comfortable around him, I\u2019m not female and even I\u2019m a little creeped out by him. \n\n She\u2019s there to learn so he needs to let her learn and sometimes that means she needs to be able to fail and not have a random classmate do everything for her. \n\nOP YTA. At 46 you can\u2019t be unfamiliar with people\u2019s body language and when someone is trying to tell you to back off.", "Well, he\u2019s a 46 year old taking a beginner cooking class. It sounds like he has all kinds of weird food safety ideas.", "Sorry missed that.", "That was the vibe I was getting. I wouldn't be surprised if everything was actually fine in reality, but because it wasn't done OP's way, it was all wrong and clearly inferior as a result.", "Yup, he was sure everyone would be swooning over his gourmet skills and is pissy no one was impressed...\n\nAnd then acting like he was jUsT cOnCeRnEd this student was going to kill off the whole class with a less than delicious salmon (something he didn't bring up until AFTER everyone had eaten?). Bruh. We all see you.", "You can literally eat it raw. Has this dude never eaten sushi?", "He also gets the old man..short for \u201cdirty old man\u201d because we all know if she had shown \u201cproper gratitude\u201d for his \u201chelp\u201d the first time getting her ingredients and didn\u2019t avoid him he\u2019d be singing her praises as he hung all over her.", "It's all good, comments are an unruly ocean"]}
