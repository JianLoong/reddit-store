You mention in a comment that you\u2019re paying to be at the school, so I assume they have more pastoral care than is mandatory for non fee-paying schools. \n\nIf so, I think it\u2019s worth going to see them and explaining the negative effects the teacher\u2019s treatment is having on you, that she\u2019s suggesting you drop your favourite subject to avoid her, making false accusations, robbing you of earned credit etc. Explaining the build up of frustration with the teacher to someone with an empathetic ear and training in how long term psychological stress/bullying can lead to uncharacteristic outbursts should help your case with the school about that one incident. \n\nAside from that they may also be able to back you up on how the things you describe can have a long term negative effect on confidence/mental health after you leave school. Hopefully this will also lead to the school taking a closer look at this teacher that appears to be base level horrible to all the students, and especially terrible to one specific victim. \n\nIf the school continue to do nothing about your reports of her bullying behaviour, then I would strongly consider reporting the school itself to whatever board/trustees/governance there is in place above the people who are currently ignoring your pleas for help.\n\nIt will help if you write out details of incidents with dates going forward (and backdated to previous incidents if possible).

This teacher created an activity in which the stipulation for achieving extra credit is that you finish first. If we take into consideration that the extra condition that everything needed to also be correct the OP still managed to complete this appropriately. This was even by admission of the teacher in OP's post.\n\nThe denying of the extra credit on no particular basis is what we call victimization. Here is a definition of Victimization for you: Victimization refers to the outcome of an intentional action taken by a person to cause harm or destroy the property of another person.\n\nLet's break this down shall we. OP completed the assigned work within a timeframe prior to the completion of any subsequent student. This is the completion of the first requirement. The second requirement(which wasn't stated be could be inferred) was that the work needed to be correct. By the teacher's admission,, the work was perfect. This completes the second requirement. Now another student came up afterwards thus not meeting the requirements and was still rewarded the extra credit. This is an intentional ac tion to harm the OP. How? Well that is simple. The OP's grade is not as high as when the extra credit is added. Regardless of whether or not they \"needed\" it as you stated. They worked for it. So if you believe this isn't Victimization, you have some pretty warped thinking. Also this is only one of the instances that was told to us by OP. \n\nYou need to understand that sometimess people are just assholes and they need to be informed of that fact.
