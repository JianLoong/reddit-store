Once, I drank water from my bottle and she thought I was drinking juice. She stopped her whole lesson and started to scold me, (even after I showed her the inside of my Bottle) she even reached to the point on telling me that the bottle is probably filled with VODKA.

Not everyone can be a teacher. \n\nTo the people defending the.teacher,this makes kids hate school and learning. We need educated people.

We can\u2019t step back and think of what the teacher is really saying in a bigger context. \n\nIt is absolutely not okay to yell at a teacher. You did not stand up to her, you eviscerated her in public. You should have gone to your counselor, dean or principal and start literally a paper trail of when she has \u201cwronged\u201d (in your eyes) you.

No matter how valid the concerns OP\u2019s parents may raise, the teacher will point to her outburst (non-pluralized if OP doesn\u2019t react similarly in future, which I find highly unlikely due to OP\u2019s insistence on turning every slight into a full-scale screaming match) as reason to invalidate any critiques and explain away her poor teaching strategies.", "> The teacher shouldnt be singling her out. \n\nGranted. But being right isn\u2019t a bulletproof vest. And screaming in the middle of a lesson plan is not the way to be taken seriously, especially in HS. It\u2019s now going to be easy to paint OP as a child with behavioral issues concerning this teacher.

Plans that do not harm her chances of getting good grades and passing the AP bio exam. If your advice is to fight to the death on every hill, even one so insignificant as this, that is terrible advice."]}
