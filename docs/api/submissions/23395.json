Would you rather find out by having something happen or by having someone tell you what could happen?", "Well, just existing and expecting to be safe isn't the same as sending nude pics and expecting them to be secure. One thing is freely shared first and sexual, the other is just existing in the outer world", "This advice is genderless and applies to all. If you send nudes you have lost control of that image and who knows where you will see it next.", "Yes lol, they\u2019re the people who need to hear it the most", "False equivalency there. Yes I\u2019d say the same advice to a woman (I am one). Young people need to be aware that there is always a risk associated with, key word, voluntarily sending their nudes to anyone, especially if you\u2019ve only been dating for a couple months and don\u2019t know what their bad side might look like. \n\nIt\u2019s an extremely different scenario from a woman who gets groped at a club involuntarily because she had the audacity to exist in public", "Distribution of pornography without consent, it\u2019s not a felony or anything but it falls under revenge porn criminal law which Carries fines up to $5000, and jail time of any of those pics she sent to her friends winds up on the internet.", "I\u2019m an old\u2026 but I was raised to never put something in pictures you don\u2019t want everyone else to see.  In writing, too.", "I understood it as \u201eask her how she\u2018d feel [\u2026], which you should definitely do\u201c.\n\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019re suggesting actually sharing her nude, but just asking her how she\u2019d feel if the roles were reversed.", "He said to \"ask her how she would feel if he did that\" not to actually do it.", "Yeah first you got the false rape/sexual assault allegations, the panic mode and lack of accountability when their guy finds them cheating, and then this. If this butch is gonna make his dikpiks public, then he may as well do the same for her vaginas pics, or, better yet, report her arse and dump her.", "No I completely agree with you; whatever works between 2 consenting adults is fine. And also agree she definitely violated his consent - as I said it\u2019s actually illegal here & for good reason. \n\nNo my thing is I just don\u2019t get the appeal of them or understand why their such a turn on or whatever but like I said it\u2019s probably just me. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve nothing against male genitalia (love my hubby\u2019s thank you lol) I\u2019m more interested in what it can do rather than how it looks \ud83d\ude02", "My experience", "Right if someone done that to me I\u2019d be shouting.", "OP is literally asking about his response.", "NTA. I'd ask her if she would've felt the same way if he did it to her. In fact, I'd guarantee that the cops would've been involved if he had done the same thing to her.", "It's 100% a violation without permission, but her sharing his dick pick in a \"Oh my god look at this thing I have the best dick this is so great I love him so much\" is a violation, but means the relationship could be salvaged with some couples therapy.\n\nAnything other than that, though, is not just a huge violation but **obvious** emotional abuse and OP needs to run the fuck away.", "THANK YOU. Sending your partner's nudes to anyone is a criminal act and OP can file a police report and press charges.", "I said \u201ccould\u201d also I\u2019m not a teenager. All of my close friends have seen me naked anyways. The sending the photo part is very intrusive. I wouldn\u2019t care if someone Saw a photo, I wouldn\u2019t feel great about someone Having a photo.\n\nAgain I\u2019m old.\n\nEdit: also as a victim of heinous sex crime, for a long time as a child I don\u2019t really equate that with a picture.", "Victim blaming.", "I think they were agreeing with you; like, even without the additional context you provided, it was still a clear NTA :)", "To support your comment, NTA. People are going to react how they will. I personally wouldn't give a shit.", "And if that pic was taken even one day before he turned 18, it's an entirely different kind of porn alltogether.", "The better solution to someone having their privacy violated by a partner sharing an intimate picture with other people is to put the onus on the sharer.", "Thank God I did all of my stupid crazy shit before cell phones and social media!", "You literally called OP an asshole for sending it, tf?", "I would be doing much more than just shouting.", "Sound advice.", "Ohhh right yeah, now I've read it with your lens it does sound that way :')", "I meant because situations like this can happen; the internet is a dodgy place & once something like these images are out there they can be used for all sorts of messed up crap. Deleting it does not remove it. It can be dangerous to send things like this."]}
