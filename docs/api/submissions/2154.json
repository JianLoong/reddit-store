"INFO: Why doesn't she consider your kids to be part of your nuclear family?", "ESH. Too bad you don't want to spend the holidays together because you all deserve each other. I am exhausted just reading about it.", "NTA. Your mom is a spoiled brat.", "I don\u2019t think this is real, but on the off chance, ESH. Host your own holidays and invite whoever you want. Grandma comes or doesn\u2019t. Frankly, it doesn\u2019t sound like much of a loss if she opts out.", "Your mom is insufferable. Why do you gift her any holidays? If you want to spend time with her. Give her a random Tuesday and let your wife and kids stay home.", "What is this BS about all the cooking? I just do not get it. Why does only one person have to cook? \n\nFor years, our family have taken turns Hosting TG and Hannukah. We ALL potluck everything. \n\nHeck, my brother was vegetarian for 25 years and Kosher for 5 years and it STILL WORKED. Whenever the Host said no cooking to the main meat, someone always stepped up. It is FAMILY TIME.\n\nAs far the no presents, I have no words. I guess I would have to explain to the kids somehow. Or provide gifts anyway and blatantly put Grd Parents name regardless.\n\nI DO know my own Mom stopped sending her Grandkids (my nephews) birthday checks because they forgot to send a TU card one year. Very vocal about it. She was very very big on TU cards when we were growing up. Sister explained to her boys the Why and they all just shrugged and accepted it.", "ESH", "NTA. Friend, your mother is a narcissist. Take a stroll over to r/raisedbynarcissists or r/narcissisticparents. You aren\u2019t alone.", "NTA. Why does she want to spend Christmas with you anyway if she\u2019s only buying gifts for her husband. She sounds like a big grump.", "Grandma does give presents so she loses Christmas forever?  ESH", "She doesn't like the holidays. She and your wife don't like each other. You're dripping with resentment toward her. It just all sounds awful!\n\nESH!!!!!\n\nAnd seriously, why must she cook? Why does it HAVE to be the traditional Thanksgiving \"feast\" if she doesn't like that kind of food? If she lives alone, for crying out loud, why don't you invite her over for a relaxed meal of spaghetti or pizza or whatever the heck you all like to eat. When your wife has had enough of making polite conversation with the MIL she can make her excuses and go read to the kids while you and your mom visit - or you can all just kick back and watch a family movie on Netflix. Or whatEVER. Stop trying to squeeze yourselves into some kind of conventional Thanksgiving Holiday Template and just figure out what works for YOUR family!", "ESH. Thank God my family was more flexible than yours. \n\nWhen my first batch of children were young, we celebrated Christmas morning at my mom\u2019s house. As our family grew, we started celebrating at our own home. (One grandmother lived with me , the other lived with my mother, and my parents were divorced so my dad stayed at his in-laws home. We did not allow kids to open gifts until my grandmother, mother and father arrived. Usually, my husband\u2019s parents spent Christmas morning with his sister and then came to our house for Christmas dinner. \n\nLife changes and loving families understand. We were told one Christmas Eve that my brother could pass at an time. That Christmas was celebrated at my mother\u2019s ( where  my brother was staying). There was no Christmas dinner. We microwaved food neighbors had sent us for the children. The adults were not hungry. \n\nAs our kids became adults, they try to form their own traditions. We don\u2019t try to guilt them but try to accommodate them.  We have dinners on different days. \n\nMy sister-in-law and her son used to spend Christmas with us. Then her sister\u2019s husband died. She now spends the holiday with her sister. I am not offended. \n\nA couple years ago, my mil\u2019s health was on a serious decline. Instead of a big Christmas dinner, we went to her home and tried to fix some dishes that she would like. (Actually, think she was past liking anything, although even on her state of ill health, she did not complain.) \n\nLife changes. It is not stagnant. While I usually try to follow family traditions, I don\u2019t want to burden my family with my traditions. (For example, I cook cabbage with a silver dollar on New Years. -My children are welcome to join me, are welcome to do this on their own, or are welcome to ignore this.) \n\nEveryone\u2019s life is difficult. Allow each to choose their own path.", "ESH\n\nY'all sound exhausting to be around", "YTA - you don\u2019t respect your moms beliefs. If she doesn\u2019t want to buy gifts or fake the idea that grandma buys gifts, that\u2019s up to her. If she doesn\u2019t like thanksgiving and cooking, that\u2019s up to her. You expect her to change to fit your beliefs and customs and that\u2019s wrong. \n\nShe said \u201cif you want a holiday come on Christmas\u201d. But you won\u2019t because she won\u2019t do it exactly like you want. It\u2019s an AH move to expect someone to host you AS you want. It\u2019s pure entitlement. You\u2019re welcome in her home, on her terms. She respected you not coming and has even done thanksgiving for you despite not wanting too and you and your wife are not overly grateful.", "ESH- for thanksgiving, cook food you like ffs. There is a reason ppl eat turkey once a year, because it\u2019s gross! Your mother could make gifts? Nothing needs to be extensive, just thoughtful.", "NTA \nI find it very odd that your mom doesn\u2019t spoil her only grandchildren. All my son\u2019s grandparents get him Christmas and Birthday gifts. Heck, my mom and stepdad buy his a gift every time they visit which is every 3 weeks. I honestly don\u2019t know a single grandparent that does buy gifts for their grandkids. \n\nYour mom complains a lot about everything too.\n\nNTA", "is your mother depressed or something?\n\nShe sounds like she finds no joy in anything - not cooking, not the grandkids, not in spending family time.\n\n sounds like she wants to be the center of attention without actually being required to do anything.\n\nYou can give her Boxing day. Carry boxes of leftover Christmas food to hers for you and your \"nuclear\" family  to eat, and she c an eat her own food lol.", "ESH. I had to quit reading your comments. Every single one of you is selfish and unwilling to compromise. The only one winning is your wife and her family. \n\nMy personal opinion is your wife needs to suck it up, and spend a Christmas with your mom.", "You and your wife suck! It seems you\u2019re making Christmas all about the gifts. Not every family does gifts, and that\u2019s okay. And not everyone enjoys cooking for a large party of people during festivals. If your mom doesn\u2019t want to cook during Thanksgiving, she shouldn\u2019t have to. How often have you or your wife helped mom out in the kitchen during these events? \n\nYour mom called you selfish, because you are. The holidays are about spending time with family, not gifts or who\u2019s cooking what. YTA, you and your wife.", "Why would anyone prepare a holiday meal that they don't like? There are traditions, but no rules. Cook what you like. We are having Brisket this year. Tell Mom that she can set the menu and you will bring part of the food. And then clean the damn kitchen when you are done so she can take a break!", "YTA. Christmas isn\u2019t about presents. Your wife sounds like an entitled child. Christmas, and pretty much every other holiday you are excluding her from are about spending time with your family.", "Op your mom\u2026 makes me very thankful for mine", "NTA\n\nit honestly sounds like your mom doesnt like holidays, as she doesnt want to follow any of the traditions that society has decided upon.\n\nThe real problem is that she is acting like you guys are jerks for not wanting to follow her way of doing things, when its really she who does not want to do things the way most people do them. \n\nYou cant force her to follow traditions she doesnt care for, the same way she cant force you guys to do things her way. \n\nWhen its your moms turn for holidays, maybe you will have to alternate between \"your way\" and \"her way\" as some sort of compromise? If she cant do a compromise, it mainly sounds like her problem cuz she is gunna have to find other people to spend the holidays with in the way she likes...gl to her if thats the case.", "NTA, does she buy them birthday gifts? She seems selfish, lazy, and cheap. She might even be boarding on narcissistic. I'd be curious to know why OP's parents are divorced, I'm guessing she might be the reason. I don't know any grandparent who doesn't buy gifts for their grandchildren.", "YTA. And so is your wife. Are presents more important than the person and the relationship?", "ESH. How'd you explain that to the grandkids,. \"No, we aren't spending Christmas with Grandma anymore, because she doesn't buy you presents.\" Real meaning of the season right there. Now, if she had bought for some grandkids, but not the others, that would be something, but she only wants to buy for her husband. Why are you crabby about that?", "NTA I buy my second cousins more presents than a lot of adults I\u2019m closer in relation to. Presents for everyone but kids are the ones that actually have things they want", "Don't forget that she and her partner are obsessed with each other, she has some form of social anxiety, and she's not really interested in the grandkids (that's in comments).", "Yes she doesn\u2019t get how being a grandma is supposed to be fun as they aren\u2019t her kids and she\u2019s been weird about it. Her main focus is definitely her husband and she feels everyone else is extended family and just wants to get him gifts", "They are extended family. Nuclear family is usually just spouses and minor kids", "Yea OP sounds entitled throughout the entire post. \n\nThis sounds like OP and wife have high expectations and MIL is over it. This doesn\u2019t sound like a family that\u2019s not grateful to have each other and has a if you don\u2019t do as I please, then enjoy your punishment (lack of my presence).", "This exactly! \u2b06\ufe0f", "Thanksgiving has traditional foods which she doesn\u2019t like", "Yes in an ideal world I like her holidays way more than my in laws and she doesn\u2019t typically sulk. She just doesn\u2019t like thanksgiving but I\u2019m a dad and I\u2019m going to put my kids first", "We\u2019ve offered to help cook but she declines. She isn\u2019t very comfortable around my wife and wouldn\u2019t want to be in the kitchen with her. Her husband claims he is helping but I think he\u2019s just hiding. He\u2019s banned anyway because he has some severe ADHD tendencies and impulse control stuff and stuck his hand up her skirt while she was reaching in the oven and honestly didn\u2019t seem to put together how badly that could have gone", "Lmao she\u2019s a narcissist because she isn\u2019t a doting grandma like a woman is expected to be it because she only wants to buy her husband gifts?", "No not at all. She finds joy in a lot of things. She doesn\u2019t like thanksgiving food which is why she wants another holiday and isn\u2019t that into being a grandma", "Because everyone else wants it", "My mom doesn\u2019t like that I moved on but then resented her for doing the same. It isn\u2019t the same thing", "But I wonder does OP just show up with their family and expect all the work for Thanksgiving to be done? My husband and I contribute 2 dishes and cleanup for my parents\u2019 thanksgiving. \n\nThanksgiving is an exhausting holiday for the host.", "I'm just trying to figure out why it's such a big deal if she doesn't bring gifts. If she has a bad attitude on Christmas, that's one thing, but the attitude some people in here have that you should only be allowed to show up at Christmas if you're willing to buy things for everyone is just.....weird. I enjoy spending time with my family on Christmas. Gifts are nice, but I can't imagine telling my parents they weren't welcome to spend the holiday with us just because they won't buy shit for my kids.", "You offering to host and her hating that, too, is important info that belongs in the post. A grandparent who refuses to gift the grandkids and a kid who makes their mom host thanksgiving both suck; this info is essential to make it clear you're NTA. You offered other compromises and she didn't like them, either!", "Has she ever been into a psychologist for diagnosis? Because she might be on the spectrum. But her generation would never have been checked for that sort of thing. Unless their problem was so severe that they absolutely could not function at all.", "OP said in a comment mom hates coming to their house. She has options where she doesn't have to spend time or money on either holiday, but those solutions weren't good enough for her.", "Is she the one cooking for Christmas?", "Ooo you should make a post with all the copies like an AITA MIL troll museum", "Another tell is that the mother is always still friends with/would rather spend time with her ex-husband and his new wife.", "OP needs to look over their own stories and maybe come up with some new ideas.\n\nI've compiled a (long) list if they need a refresher course.", "You didn\u2019t answer the question. Do you and wife actually contribute to the work in Thanksgiving?", "Dude that\u2019s so weird.  I\u2019m going NTA now lol", "He stuck his hand up\u2026 whose skirt exactly?", "You're the one here complaining about her, so if others read Your Own Words and try to provide help/advice for you, why complain? YTA for that.", "That could be true. But according to OP, when they've hosted thanksgiving, sadly mom and husband aren't comfortable at OP's house and behave strangely and OP's husband barely touches the food.", "Agreed.

Cornell law defines immediate family to include grandparents.  I feel like your first sentence comes from the wiki on immediate family; nearly the same phrasing.
