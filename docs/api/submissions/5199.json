My mom died when I was 5 and Jess wanted to step in and be regarded as a mom to me. She never pushed. I do want to say that right off the bat. But while I like her okay, I have never ever thought of her as my mother and I do not love her in the same way I love my actual parents. If I had to say I love her more like some of my aunt's than my parents. It's a very different way I look at her. But I know she has always seen me as her son. My dad and stepmom had a baby in September after years of not being able to and having a few miscarriages. This is her first official Christmas as a mom. Her family told my dad she should go all out and make it special for her since it's her first Christmas as a mom. He was offended and asked them about me, but I agreed and told him he should make this special for her. I told him she has her own kid after years of not getting that kind of love or relationship with me and it should be celebrated. He was mad and asked me how I could say this is her first Christmas as a mom when she has been raising me since I was 7. I told him it's because I will never call her mom, never love her like my mom and she will not be treated as my mom in the future. And that it will be different with her son (hopefully but I didn't say that) so she deserves to have some extra celebrating around the fact her dream came true and she can finally have that. He was SO mad at me for agreeing with her family.\n\nApparently my stepmom heard us all talking and she was so upset that I agreed with her family, and that I had told him to celebrate her first Christmas as a mom, that I considered this her first Christmas as a mom. She also heard what I said to him about why I felt he should. She cried to him for hours apparently about how she had two kids in her heart but only one would ever love her like that in return and how painful it is for me to regard her as less than a parent and less than a mom. So that made my dad even more angry and he said I should never have agreed with them and never have told him what to do for Christmas.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and my dad is still angry with me over it and there has been a lot of tension. He told me I was wrong and I was cruel to claim that for her after all those years and I feel bad because ever since she has been so much more quiet and almost depressed and I know my words were harder for her than her parents.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671541312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqnwfc/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_should_celebrate_his/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're both kinda right. \n\nJess may see you as her kid and that is not only okay - it's great! Not every step parent feels like that towards their step child and not to be pushy, but that is definitely you're very lucky to have. So I can understand your dad as well. To him she filled a huge void that your mother left, so he probably feels that rejection the same way she does. It is indeed a cruel situation for Jess - but that doesn't make you an AH.\n\nYou've lost your biological mom and if you don't feel like anyone else can take that place - that is valid. You can't change what you feel. \n\nI think this whole situation is just sad. I would however say, that you may be able to find better words for Jess than the ones you used. That woman has raised you for years. Just because she can't take your mother's place doesn't mean that she isn't an important person in your life. \n\nThink about what hurts her... to her you are her first child. But is she really just anyone to you? Just your dad's *replacable* partner? Because I think that feeling must be incredibly hurtful to her. If that's NOT the case, then tell her what she means to you. \n\nYou don't have to apologize for how you feel, but you can find better words.", "NTA but maybe we should refocus on it being \u201cthe baby\u2019s first Christmas\u201d", "There are NAH\n\nIt hurt for her and your dad to hear, of course it did, but nobody will ever replace your mother and you can't force yourself to love her that way. This is just a really tough situation for all of you, that's all.", "NAH\n\nThere's a lot of differences in opinion here but in the end, you wanting to have your stepmom celebrate becoming a biological mother is a big deal. This discussion should stay between you, your dad, and your stepmom, leave the extended family out of it. \n\nPersonally, I see your point. Your love for Jess is different from how you love your bio mom and dad; it always will be that way. That may change over time, too. Jess being hurt by that is her WANTING to take your mom's place but knowing she can't. Being a stepmom doesn't get to come with any big expectations on your relationship with your stepchildren. You cannot expect to take the biological parents' place. Your dad is just caught in the middle and knows that getting mad at you is something he understands better than trying to change his wifes mind.", "NAH, she loves you as her own and you dont feel she is your mother. no one can ever replace her, and your feelings are valid. if anyones TA, its your dad for getting mad at you.", "NTA. You are not accountable for her feelings. We may love someone but there is no guarantee we will be loved back no matter how much we try and do.", "NTA-you can\u2019t help how you feel and your parental figures should be grown up enough to understand that. Your father\u2019s reaction is troubling (you\u2019re 16 and being honest with him-he should be open to hearing you), but your stepmom\u2019s is understandable. This is not anyone\u2019s fault; it\u2019s just how you feel. I would simply leave if all alone and move on. Behave daily as if nothing is wrong, get them both and your new sibling nice Christmas gifts, and enjoy the holidays with your entire family. All that said, be open to the idea that your stepmom may one day become your mom in your mind. Never say never. That\u2019s probably the only sentence you shouldn\u2019t have said. If it comes up in conversation again, make it clear that you do have love and appreciation for your stepmom.", "NTA. You don't see her as a mom and she should be fine with that.", "NAH.\n\nYour stepmother felt that she had done everything possible to show that she was a mother to you, and you felt distant and therefore unable to fulfill the desired role.  You felt that she was going to get something from having a biological child, that she didn\u2019t get from parenting you. She desperately wanted to believe that was not the case.\n\nYou had the best of intentions. You were giving advice, you feel obligated to share with your father.  She listened in and reacted immaturely, particularly given that she is the adult in the situation and you are 16 years old. \n\nUnfortunately, this kind of rejection can be very painful for a woman who has perhaps put a little too much of her identity into trying to be the best mother. Please have compassion on us women, we care a lot, and we can get attached to feeling that we have earned a certain role.  It\u2019s emotionally pressuring that she took this so personally in front of you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inauthentic. She really wanted to be your mom that much, and you just can\u2019t let her, and that\u2019s really sad, but it\u2019s also OK and your boundaries are OK and they should be respected.\n\nThe fact that she was eavesdropping needs to be addressed on its own. That\u2019s not right, and well, that\u2019s what you get when you eavesdrop. You hear shit that wasn\u2019t meant for you and that might hurt your feelings. That\u2019s on her. Again, she\u2019s the adult. You were sharing your honest opinion with your dad, your only living parent. You have the right to do that. You had the right to do that without her intrusion. She needs to handle her feelings and not take them out on you, especially if she thinks she\u2019s such a wonderful mother.\n\nRegardless of the real reasons that you don\u2019t feel close to your stepmother, you have the right to feel however you feel and you have the right to your opinions. You have the right to express your opinions confidentially to your dad. Your dad has the responsibility to provide you with the privacy to do so, if he wants to be a safe parental figure for you. Your dad and your stepmom also need to work out their emotional issues privately, rather than burdening you with this knowledge.\n\nIf you can get access to a therapist, I highly recommend one. If you don\u2019t feel safe with the current one, by the way, you can absolutely get another one instead. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly trying to be the adult in a situation where people aren\u2019t acting all that appropriately, and congratulations on that. It can be hard to maintain your boundaries when people around you have poor ones. I recommend that you be kind, but don\u2019t be too open with her. And really, have a private conversation with your dad about what he\u2019s going to do to make sure that she\u2019s not eavesdropping in the future.  I recommend that you mention to him that you were simply sharing your feelings at the time, and that what he does is his business. Nobody can control how you feel towards your stepmom. You are simply trying to make sure that she has all of her needs met. And then drop it.", "NTA", "NAH other than your overbearing dad, who believes it's acceptable to tell others how to feel.  Your feelings are entirely valid and don't let anyone pressure you into changing them; hers are too, but she's not entitled to anything you're not willing to volunteer.  \n\nWe define others' relationships to us, not ours to them (that's for them to decide).", "You've learned an important life lesson. People who insist that you \"be honest\" don't actually want your real thoughts and feelings. They want to be told how right they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You know who your Mom is. Jess can love you with all her heart and soul but that doesn\u2019t mean you owe her anything. Your parents are both overreacting and creating an issue when they should be planning and celebrating. Tons of kids resent their stepparents. Your Dad should be happy you and Jess have a friendship at all. You weren\u2019t even the one who called it her first Christmas as a Mom - her family did and you simply echoed it.", "NTA - it was a lose/lose situation and you were honest.  Someone could've/would've been offended either way you responded.", "NAH - No one can force themselves to feel anything, despite what some people seem to think. \n\nPeople have said it mostly already but I will add one thing, Jess had your little brother in September, so, chances are her body is still dealing with the hormone changes that being pregnant, having a baby and then not being pregnant anymore causes, one of the side effects is that some women can have an increased emotional reaction for several months after having a baby and I suspect that is at least partly responsible for how she reacted.", "YTA - what you failed to pick up on is that when her family made the comment about it being her first Christmas as a mom, she jumped to defend YOU. Her family was essentially drawing a line between the two of you, and she wouldn't let them toss you aside like that. She was honouring her role in your life, and yours in her life, by saying it wasn't her first Christmas as a mom. I even doubt that it was really about the mom TITLE so much as the mom ROLE (based on your own comments). \n\nYou don't need to assign her the mom title. She will never replace your bio-mom, who will always have that title in your life. However, by your own admission, she has been filling the mom ROLE for most of your life. THAT'S why this was such a slap in the face. You don't need to be any more affectionate or outwardly loving than you're comfortable with, but you can't explain away her years of dedication and love for you as anything less than what it was - her taking on the mother role in your life. So no, this is not her first Christmas as a mom. It's baby's first Christmas, which is how this whole thing should have been framed, but it is not her first Christmas as a mom and what you said was incredibly, incredibly hurtful. You owe her an apology.", "NTA. You have a good heart for trying to encourage the parental relationship your stepmom will (should) have with her own child. You are being brave and honest about your own feelings and you shouldn't be faulted for that.\n\n However, you may someday change your mind about how you describe your relationship with this woman. She may not be your mother, but those are often big shoes to fill. When you are older, maybe raising your children, you may look back and rethink your relationship as more parental than Aunt. It may be worth the effort now to try smoothing things over.", "I think you are NTA because Jess was eavesdropping and what you said wasn\u2019t meant for her. Also, she knows how you feel from therapy, so even if she is disappointed she shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is this \u201cgoing all out for her first Christmas as a mom\u201d. Did you get crappy presents from her? Did she cook regular day-to-day food? I\u2019m not criticizing you, but I want to know what more could she or your dad do that they hadn\u2019t done before with just you. Do you mean your dad should give her an extra special present?", "NTA. You\u2019re still a kid and (it sounds like) you\u2019re still dealing with a lot of complicated feelings. I\u2019m sorry you lost your mom. I can\u2019t imagine losing a parent so young and them being \u201creplaced\u201d so quickly. Not saying your dad remarried too fast, just speculating that maybe somewhere inside your 9yo mind you felt like he did. \n\nIt sounds like your stepmom has been good to you and loves you. Her overhearing this may impact your relationship, which is unfortunate, but in the years to come you\u2019ll realize what she means (or has meant) to you.", "This is why people don't want to be a step parent. It's sometimes one of the most unrewarding things. We always see posts of evil step-parents alienating their partners bio kids. I'm not saying you're evil or anything...\n\nBut I can't imagine being in her shoes and hearing that. Dedicating all their time and effort to someone that doesn't love them back. Looking at your post she seems to not just have loved you  but literally took care of you half your life with the only thing missing was the blood to be called a mom.... \n\nYou're entitled not to love people back, you're entitled not to call her mom but words do hurt and you knew that would hurt her. Sucks for her in this situation...\n\nI hope her kid they have fills the void you can't fulfill nd I hope you don't experience this as well if you ever decide to have kids or be a step parent one day.", "This is weird. Why is \"mom's first christmas\" a thing in your family? I've never heard anyone make some distinction about it being mom's first Christmas. \n\nHeck, we don't pamper mom's much at Christmas. We go gaga for babies, and mom runs around trying to make a nice holiday for people. And maybe gets a robe. \n\nAll off this could have, and should have, been avoided by folks saying stepmother deserves a good Christmas. Not making any distinction about if she is a first time mom or not. \n\nEither this is steppmom trolling or something more is going on than what is in this post.", "I think I'll go with NTA for now because you're pretty young... even though you don't mean it in a bad way, you didn't NEED to add that you agreed with opinions that clearly upset them. I don't think you are wrong for feeling this way at all, but I understand for them how these comments feel like back handed compliments.\n\nhave you considered that your family might be trying to make her feel like she didn't belong? that only now she has a family? Just because she's not your mom didn't mean she's not family. that's not a nice way to treat an aunt, either. Just some food for thought", "This is a tough one my dude. \n\nYour thoughts and feelings are completely valid - no one is ever going to replace your Mom. She will always have a special place in your heart. It sounds like Jess has given you a lot of space and has been caring and nurturing as well and I can see how she was hurt by your words. I think your delivery of the message it's what's at issue here. I think you could have conveyed your feelings without being as harsh on Jess as you were but I don't blame you for being blunt either. \n\nI think a way you be able to reconcile or at least try to mend the relationship with both your Dad and Jess is to explain why you feel this way. Losing your Mom at such a young age must have been very impactful. You could speak to that. Most importantly though, you do need to let Jess know how much you appreciate her, and that you care for her (if you do feel that way). She's probably feeling utterly abandoned by you right now and doesn't understand why you feel this way. \n\nHave you talked to a counselor or therapist about this? They might be better equipped to help you find a way to tell Jess you appreciate her for everything she's done while simultaneously explaining she'll never be able to replace your Mom. \n\nI'm sorry buddy, for everything you're going through.

On top of the fact that she just has a baby and could be battling with hormone issues and postpartum depression too. I don\u2019t think you were wrong for agreeing that her family should go all out for her, just for the fact that she does now have her first biological child after having miscarriages, I just think it came off the wrong way.

You might not love her as a mom, but you sound like you have no love for her at all. \n\nYour comments weren't about celebrating her, they were about reminding her, your dad, and her family that you will never see her as your mom or care for her.

The way you worded it, \"she has always wanted to be regarded as my mother\" doesn't mean she can effectively erase your actual mom that you lost. I get that she wanted to fill what she saw as an empty space, but it wasn't empty. It was never empty, or vacant.

Trying to celebrate a hard won victory isn't a bad thing, nor is being honest about your feelings. Good luck!

I think crying for hours is rather excessive on her part, but as a stepmom she\u2019s in a complicated position and probably feels like she failed you. Your dad might be contributing to that - he may have been pushing the new mom narrative hard as well.", "NTA you can't control her reactions to how you actually feel & no one should be guilt tripping you to claim you feel any different. Once her child grows up, she will feel what it is to be loved like a parent & see the difference; she shouldn't hold that against you either. No one can truly ever replace your mom without your consent.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH because this is such a non issue that everyone is making into an issue.\n\nHow\u2019s does one celebrate Christmas a \u2018new\u2019 mum? Cause I\u2019ve got s kid and apart from having to buy and wrap more presents for my kid I can\u2019t fathom how anyone would make that all about me. Mother\u2019s Day sure? Christmas no.", "I kinda think You are the Asshole so F\u00f9cking what She's not Your Birth Mother She loves You as if You were Her Own She was there for You since You were 7 She Loves You and Care about You may not think of Her as a Mom but She thinks of You as a Son", "Sorry for the loss of your mom but  - It\u2019s really sad that you can\u2019t allow yourself to love and be loved by someone who seems so caring and giving. You\u2019re so lucky to have this woman in your life who\u2019s raised someone else\u2019s child as her own. I think your biological mother would be disappointed in your behavior. The walls you\u2019ve put up and the chip you carry around around on your shoulder must be exhausting to maintain and you are hurting yourself, your dad, your stepmom and the memory of your mother by acting like an ungrateful child. Millions of step kids would trade places with you in a heartbeat. And you\u2019re also driving an early wedge between you and your new half-brother, instead of realizing that he represents even more love that has come into your life. You should wake up and see how good you\u2019ve got it. Apologize and join their Christmas celebration instead is wallowing in passive-aggressive self pity. YTA", "ESH, you made you feelings clear. You sound like a nice kid, and I\u2019m sorry for you loss. Now your stepmother will probably focus her time and energy to her new born than trying to have that close bond with you. You made your feeling clear to her that she\u2019s not your mom, and she will just start treating you that way.", "Soft, soft YTA. You can\u2019t help feeling like you feel. There\u2019s nothing in the universe that can force somebody to love another person. It has to come naturally. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault.\n\nBut the reason YT (minor) A is because you really should have considered how those words would sound. I know you didn\u2019t know she could hear, but the things you said were profoundly dynamic-shifting things. You can\u2019t just say them casually and expect no fallout or hurt feelings. \n\nIt could be possible that you\u2019re also misreading your own feelings without realizing it. I think you do love this woman as a mother, because this all came about when you were advocating for something special for her. Biological bonds and familial love are often presented as being one feeling, because for 99% of people they\u2019re simultaneous. But as an adopted person who now has a biological child, I personally feel \u201clove\u201d (liking to be around them, admiring them, being proud of them, wanting them to be happy, etc.) as something different from \u201cbiological connection\u201d (wanting the best opportunities for them so that the genes we share can succeed). There\u2019s a lot of overlap. But I think what you feel for your stepmother is parental love, it\u2019s just missing the other feeling that you have for your dad and bio mom so you think it\u2019s not as strong.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is making as much sense as I want it to.\n\nBut you do owe her an explanation and a hug.", "Soft YTA. You were kinda harsh the way you said it. Agreed it is her first Christmas as a \u201cmom\u201d but damn do you have to say you\u2019ll never love her like that or treat her like that? Poor lady.", "NTA.  Your father and step-mother are completely in the wrong here.  Emotions cannot and should not ever be forced.  You had a mother and you loved her.  It\u2019s insane and stupid and wrong to expect that another woman could ever take her place in your heart.  They are upset because the woman your father decided to marry failed to replace your mother in your heart - and they were wrong to expect that she would.\n\nYour step-mother\u2019s emotions are hers to manage - not yours.  The fact that she loves you like a son is lovely, but she has no right to expect you to feel the same way about her.  You have nothing to feel guilty about because you have done nothing wrong.  You are certainly no asshole.  Your father is the only asshole here for being angry with you.", "I am just looking for answer before I give an opinion. She has treated you like her son, yet you don\u2019t see her as a mom. Are you fine with her \u201cacting\u201d like your mom when it benefits you? Do you or have you enjoyed having her do mom things for you? My guess is the answer is probably yes, but I am curious.", "[deleted]", "Nta You plainly say you don't see her as a mom, you don't have a relationship with her as a mom.  You get along okay and that's fine.  \n\nBut you've made it very clear that she is your *stepmom* NOT your mom.  So this is her first Christmas as a mom.\n\nI would however,  expect that relationship to change now that you've made it exceedingly clear that you see her as a replaceable 'dads wife' figure.", "Exactly how I feel. Could\u2019ve been kinder with the word choice, but it\u2019s ok to feel how he feels.", "It hurt for her and your dad to hear.", "Yuup.\n\nFocusing it on \u201cLittle Sib\u2019s\u201d first Christmas in the family can still allow the Dad to do something special for Jess. It sounds much less emotionally fraught for both OP and Jess to take the focus off the Mother conversation.", "YES!", "Some don't, it's true; others, like myself, do.  We want truth, not an ego boost.", "She didn't say anything to them. That was my dad. She wasn't supposed to be there. She was meant to be out. The conversation was not had knowingly where she could hear.", "That dad should take the time to focus more on her and on the joy of having their much longed for baby. She especially focuses on everyone but herself and I thought after finally having her dream come true, making sure it was extra special and celebrated would be nice for her.", "It's not a common thing. But I know some people do it if they have tried for  a long time to have kids and struggled. That was my stepmom.", "It was her family who told him to plan something. Her parents and her sister. Not mine or my dad's family. They know I don't see her as a mom and they wanted her to focus on her own son and not think as much about me because they know I don't return her love. I didn't see it as a bad idea at all. But also, this was said just to my dad. I thought my stepmom was gone out with the baby when the talk was happening. She was supposed to be gone.", "I've been in therapy since I was 6 years old. We also did family therapy for a while.", "It's not about being more than I think I do. But it's not the kind of love she and my dad want me to feel for her. The love I have for her is not even close to the level I have for my mom and dad, and it's not as close as the love I have for my grandparents, who would be my choice of guardian's if I lost my dad tomorrow. But I do have love for her. I think she's a great person. I have said all this before too. I just know they keep thinking that will change but I do not see that happening.", "My comments were not said to her. They were said to my dad. They were said that way because my dad asked and my dad does not hear when you say things gently. I have spoken to her before, in therapy, about my feelings and why I feel the way I do in a more gentle way. But to my dad, I was as blunt and honest as I could be because it is how I feel.\n\nAnd I think she does deserve to be celebrated extra this Christmas and to enjoy all the firsts that are coming her way and the things she will get from having a son of her own that she would never get from me. I think she deserves that after so many years. Her family wanted that for her too.", "Right, you could say it\u2019s BABY\u2019S first Christmas, but it sounds like everyone just wants to make poor Jess feel like shit.", "We've talked about it a lot. Including in family therapy in the past (before she had the baby).", "I didn't say it to her. I said it to my dad. I had no idea she was there. She was supposed to be out with the baby, or so I thought.", "I don't blame them for that. They know I don't feel like she's my mom. They are very aware my relationship with them is different to the one with my biological families as well.", "I have seen it on social media. The spouse normally takes over, makes a big deal about them doing nothing, gives them an extra special gift and celebrates the long wanted child. I've seen a few and they were done because someone tried to have a baby for years.", "what? your proving OP\u2019s point even more.", "Is there a keyboard add-on that does that capitalisation of the first letters or...", "We define others' relationship to us (\"*I feel like you're my own son\")*, not ours to them (*\"I'm your new mom whether you like it or not!\").*  \n\nJust caring about someone does not entitle us to a relationship with them; it has to be reciprocated.", "You can't force a relationship. OP sounds like a nice kid who has a good relationship with the stepmom but doesn't see her as a mom. It might suck, but she can't force her way into that role. \n\nDoesn't seem like OP is wallowing, just dad and stepmom. Do you have a chip on your shoulder?", "It's not exhausting. I'm still happy with my life and I am happy for my stepmom that she was finally able to have a baby of her own. It's not about not allowing myself. I don't want to have another mom. I am happy to have her be just my stepmom.", "I do not love her as a mother. If my dad died, I would feel more comforted and better living with either set of grandparents, who I am closer to, over her. When I need comforting my dad is who I go to over her. I still like her. I don't hate having her around and she's been good to me and when things are good, it's really good. But it's nowhere near the same. It's not even close.", "I'm not yelling at her and telling her to stop but I would be fine if she didn't do the mom things for me. The baby has been such a focus anyway that the shift already started and I don't mind. Her focusing on her son is a very good thing and I can do pretty much everything for myself.", "I'm totally fine with that. I won't be jealous of that stuff. I want that for them. Just like I will have family who will get me stuff that won't get him stuff, since they are not related.", "Ahh got it. The sentiment is right, I think. I mean, as you said, she just gave birth to her long-awaited son. But maybe her family and you could phrase it as \u201cgoing all out to pamper her after giving birth\u201d or \u201ccelebration a successful pregnancy\u201d and not focusing on the mom thing? Good luck!!", "ah, I see. Like I said I don't think y.ta for feeling this way or even agreeing necessarily. This only matters if you don't want to hurt her feelings in the future,  but if you don't,  it might be best to avoid \"rubbing it in\" by voicing opinions like this even if you think she's away- since this time, you thought she was, but wasn't.\n\nagain I don't think you're wrong for feeling this way, and I don't think it's your job to make her feel good, but just if you care and want to be compassionate, that's what I think. otherwise, if you don't care, you don't really have to worry about it- just be ready to accept it might cause tension with your Father and stepmom", "Dude you\u2019re so harsh! You dont return her love? Maybe she should start treating you like shit. I initially said soft YTA, but now it\u2019s a firm YTA.", "If you don't return her love you don't see her as your auntie either. You aren't an asshole but you need counseling to get over your mom's death. It is ok to not see her as a mom but to not have any positive emotions for her like love means you have some attachment issues. \n\nSmall children who are consistently parented by a kind and attentive person develop feelings of love for that person. You need help to understand why you never bonded with your step mom so that you don't have attachment issues in the future.\n\nI've been a mom a long time and I can tell you that when I die I want my daughters to be able to have another mom. This would be especially true if I had died while they were a small child. It is ok to love your stepmother and it isn't abandoning or betraying your mom. \n\nYou need help to sort out your emotions for your mom and for your stepmom. \n\nTry this first exercise. Close your eyes. Pretend with me for a minute. \n\nYour dad comes in to your room, crying hysterically. \"Your step mom was just hit by a drunk driver and killed.\"\n\nThis situation is the last thing you ever did with her. \n\nAre you happy she is dead? Indifferent? Would you cry? Throw a party? Do you feel guilty at all that the last thing you did was break her heart?\n\nThe fact you came here to ask if you are the asshole means you do care. You aren't betraying your mom if you love the woman who loved and raised you. What did you call your mom? Mom? \n\nThen she'll never be your mom, but maybe she can be your ma, or your momma? \n\nWhat about when you have children? Will you forbid her from being grandma? Taking away the only grandma on your dad's side they could have? When you know she is a kind and loving person who would only love your kids?\n\nYou need counseling. I am so sorry you lost one mom to death and are throwing another mom away. You were cruel to someone who has only been kind to you. Is that the kind of person your mom would have wanted you to be? Is that who you want to be?\n\nMay you get help to deal with your loss and confusion.", "And I totally get what you\u2019re saying and I thinks it\u2019s ridiculous for them to think that your would love her the same way and as deeply as you did you mom! Btw I am so sorry for your loss! They should not be mad that you don\u2019t have the type of love for her as you did your mom. I think your dad was also trying to stand up for you with his wife\u2019s family and the thought they had of her not being a mom before she has her own son, although I get what they way trying to do for her after she suffered through those miscarriages.", "You are NTA for not having feelings you don\u2019t feel.\n\nLoosing a parent at an age is a life changing thing to go through. You can\u2019t magically bond with your Stepmom to that level just because they want you too. It sounds like you are kind to each other and you support her relationship with your Dad, you are happy for them that they have your sibling, and are thankful for what she has done for you. You actually wanted her to experience a good Christmas. That should be enough. \n\n16 is often a complicated time for parent/kid relationships anyway. It is when you are getting ready to be more independent and go through periods of pushing them away. To navigate that plus your complicated Mother feelings is a lot to grapple with. StepMom is an adult, and ultimately it is on her to manage her own feelings. \n\nYou can tell her what she does mean to you, that you do care about her, and that you are happy she is in your family. But that you lost your Mother and no one, no matter how kind, can replace her.", "What does that even mean? What do you think mothers get at Christmas?\n\nWe get the work. That\u2019s what we get. And I guarantee your stepmom has already done plenty of it for you over the years.\n\nThis whole \u201cextraspecialcrazyChristmas\u201d thingy, I don\u2019t even get what that means. \n\nKind of seems like everyone might have just let your parents choose how to celebrate with tying an enjoyable holiday to your stepmom\u2019s fertility.\n\nESH", "If she knows and you\u2019ve spoke multiple times about how you feel and you\u2019re supportive with the fact that this is her first Christmas as a mom there really shouldn\u2019t be any problem, it seems your dad was upset about the families comments reassure him it\u2019s okay. It may make her feel upset but there\u2019s not too much you can do about it but let her know you appreciate and love her! Don\u2019t beat your self up about it have a good holiday season with the new baby!", "No, I don\u2019t. But thanks for asking. The stepmom is going out of her way to make him feel included and loved and not demanding anything in return. It\u2019s not what he feels that distressing; it\u2019s how he presents his feelings that seem insensitive to someone whose raised him and loved him while always walking in the shadow of his own mother.", "The things you said were hurtful. I\u2019m sure she already knows she can\u2019t replace your mom but reminding her of that when she\u2019s going out of her way to make you feel included and loved is pretty insensitive on your part.", "Even for people with two biological parents who they \u201clove\u201d there\u2019s often one parent they\u2019d trust more and share more of a bond with. Heck, I have some friends who I\u2019d rely on before I\u2019d go to my Dad. I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re equating those feelings with familial love when they\u2019re a whole separate issue. And regardless of those complicated feelings, you crushed a woman who didn\u2019t deserve it.", "NAH\nBut you have in the past enjoyed the benefits of her doing those things? Honestly I don\u2019t think you are a AH, but I have seen enough of these step parent post, to think that while not on purpose it seems like you have sent a lot of mix messages. Which happens, but you also can\u2019t fault her for being upset when it happens. I imagine it has given her a lot of false hope in regards to you. \n   Setting up healthy boundaries for everyone is important, but also please don\u2019t post again in a year complaining about your evil step mom who never pay attention to you, etc\u2026. Then you would be the AH", "I don't return her love in the same way. I do love her. But it's not as strong as the love she has for me, and it never will be.", "WTF?  That's creeper logic:  \"I love her so much, so she should love me back!  Doesn't she know our love is meant to be?\"\n\nWe can't *obligate* anyone into loving us.", "I DO love her. I do not love her the same way. The love I have for her is more like what I have for some of my aunts. It's not as close as what I have for my parents or grandparents, for example. And I have one aunt who I am extra bonded with because she was super close to my mom and is so like her, so she feels like a part of my mom is still here. But I still care. I am glad she finally gets a kid who will love her the way she wants to be loved.\n\nI have been in therapy since I was 6. We have done family therapy. Therapy did not change how I feel. It just helped me express it in a way to them (at the time) that made things progress.", "I have seen some social media posts where people who struggled to have kids and finally have one get these special celebrations at Christmas.

He didn't say that to her; he said it to his demanding dad.  She eavesdropped; that's on her.", "I didn't say that to her. I had no idea she was even home. She was supposed to be out with the baby. I said it to my dad because he wanted to know why I felt like it was her first Christmas as a mom, and why I wanted a big deal made out of that for her. I wouldn't be as blunt with her, especially when she's a new mom.", "She wasn\u2019t supposed to listen to OP, so it\u2019s her fault for eavesdropping. OP told his dad his feelings.
