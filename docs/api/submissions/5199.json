My mom died when I was 5 and Jess wanted to step in and be regarded as a mom to me. She never pushed. I do want to say that right off the bat. But while I like her okay, I have never ever thought of her as my mother and I do not love her in the same way I love my actual parents. If I had to say I love her more like some of my aunt's than my parents. It's a very different way I look at her. But I know she has always seen me as her son. My dad and stepmom had a baby in September after years of not being able to and having a few miscarriages. This is her first official Christmas as a mom. Her family told my dad she should go all out and make it special for her since it's her first Christmas as a mom. He was offended and asked them about me, but I agreed and told him he should make this special for her. I told him she has her own kid after years of not getting that kind of love or relationship with me and it should be celebrated. He was mad and asked me how I could say this is her first Christmas as a mom when she has been raising me since I was 7. I told him it's because I will never call her mom, never love her like my mom and she will not be treated as my mom in the future. And that it will be different with her son (hopefully but I didn't say that) so she deserves to have some extra celebrating around the fact her dream came true and she can finally have that. He was SO mad at me for agreeing with her family.\n\nApparently my stepmom heard us all talking and she was so upset that I agreed with her family, and that I had told him to celebrate her first Christmas as a mom, that I considered this her first Christmas as a mom. She also heard what I said to him about why I felt he should. She cried to him for hours apparently about how she had two kids in her heart but only one would ever love her like that in return and how painful it is for me to regard her as less than a parent and less than a mom. So that made my dad even more angry and he said I should never have agreed with them and never have told him what to do for Christmas.\n\nIt's been a few weeks and my dad is still angry with me over it and there has been a lot of tension. He told me I was wrong and I was cruel to claim that for her after all those years and I feel bad because ever since she has been so much more quiet and almost depressed and I know my words were harder for her than her parents.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA: Just because this has come up a few times. I did not know she was at home. She was supposed to be out with baby when all this went down. I only found out when my dad came back even angrier and told me what she had said to him. None of us, as far as I know, were aware she was home at the time or that she might hear us.\n\n2nd ETA: I have been in therapy since I was 6 and we did family therapy together at a point and I was honest about how I felt and did so clearly but with help from the therapist. I think hope for her lingered though and that my dad believed it would change in time.", "created_utc": 1671541312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqnwfc/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_should_celebrate_his/", "score": 1666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're both kinda right.\n\nJess may see you as her kid and that is not only okay - it's great! Not every step parent feels like that towards their step child and not to be pushy, but that is definitely you're very lucky to have. So I can understand your dad as well. To him she filled a huge void that your mother left, so he probably feels that rejection the same way she does. It is indeed a cruel situation for Jess - but that doesn't make you an AH.\n\nYou've lost your biological mom and if you don't feel like anyone else can take that place - that is valid. You can't change what you feel.\n\nI think this whole situation is just sad. I would however say, that you may be able to find better words for Jess than the ones you used. That woman has raised you for years. Just because she can't take your mother's place doesn't mean that she isn't an important person in your life.\n\nThink about what hurts her... to her you are her first child. But is she really just anyone to you? Just your dad's *replacable* partner? Because I think that feeling must be incredibly hurtful to her. If that's NOT the case, then tell her what she means to you.\n\nYou don't have to apologize for how you feel, but you can find better words.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the award!", "NTA but maybe we should refocus on it being \u201cthe baby\u2019s first Christmas\u201d", "There are NAH\n\nIt hurt for her and your dad to hear, of course it did, but nobody will ever replace your mother and you can't force yourself to love her that way. This is just a really tough situation for all of you, that's all.", "NAH\n\nThere's a lot of differences in opinion here but in the end, you wanting to have your stepmom celebrate becoming a biological mother is a big deal. This discussion should stay between you, your dad, and your stepmom, leave the extended family out of it. \n\nPersonally, I see your point. Your love for Jess is different from how you love your bio mom and dad; it always will be that way. That may change over time, too. Jess being hurt by that is her WANTING to take your mom's place but knowing she can't. Being a stepmom doesn't get to come with any big expectations on your relationship with your stepchildren. You cannot expect to take the biological parents' place. Your dad is just caught in the middle and knows that getting mad at you is something he understands better than trying to change his wifes mind.", "NAH, she loves you as her own and you dont feel she is your mother. no one can ever replace her, and your feelings are valid. if anyones TA, its your dad for getting mad at you.", "NTA. You are not accountable for her feelings. We may love someone but there is no guarantee we will be loved back no matter how much we try and do.", "NTA-you can\u2019t help how you feel and your parental figures should be grown up enough to understand that. Your father\u2019s reaction is troubling (you\u2019re 16 and being honest with him-he should be open to hearing you), but your stepmom\u2019s is understandable. This is not anyone\u2019s fault; it\u2019s just how you feel. I would simply leave if all alone and move on. Behave daily as if nothing is wrong, get them both and your new sibling nice Christmas gifts, and enjoy the holidays with your entire family. All that said, be open to the idea that your stepmom may one day become your mom in your mind. Never say never. That\u2019s probably the only sentence you shouldn\u2019t have said. If it comes up in conversation again, make it clear that you do have love and appreciation for your stepmom.", "NTA. You don't see her as a mom and she should be fine with that.", "NAH.\n\nYour stepmother felt that she had done everything possible to show that she was a mother to you, and you felt distant and therefore unable to fulfill the desired role.  You felt that she was going to get something from having a biological child, that she didn\u2019t get from parenting you. She desperately wanted to believe that was not the case.\n\nYou had the best of intentions. You were giving advice, you feel obligated to share with your father.  She listened in and reacted immaturely, particularly given that she is the adult in the situation and you are 16 years old. \n\nUnfortunately, this kind of rejection can be very painful for a woman who has perhaps put a little too much of her identity into trying to be the best mother. Please have compassion on us women, we care a lot, and we can get attached to feeling that we have earned a certain role.  It\u2019s emotionally pressuring that she took this so personally in front of you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inauthentic. She really wanted to be your mom that much, and you just can\u2019t let her, and that\u2019s really sad, but it\u2019s also OK and your boundaries are OK and they should be respected.\n\nThe fact that she was eavesdropping needs to be addressed on its own. That\u2019s not right, and well, that\u2019s what you get when you eavesdrop. You hear shit that wasn\u2019t meant for you and that might hurt your feelings. That\u2019s on her. Again, she\u2019s the adult. You were sharing your honest opinion with your dad, your only living parent. You have the right to do that. You had the right to do that without her intrusion. She needs to handle her feelings and not take them out on you, especially if she thinks she\u2019s such a wonderful mother.\n\nRegardless of the real reasons that you don\u2019t feel close to your stepmother, you have the right to feel however you feel and you have the right to your opinions. You have the right to express your opinions confidentially to your dad. Your dad has the responsibility to provide you with the privacy to do so, if he wants to be a safe parental figure for you. Your dad and your stepmom also need to work out their emotional issues privately, rather than burdening you with this knowledge.\n\nIf you can get access to a therapist, I highly recommend one. If you don\u2019t feel safe with the current one, by the way, you can absolutely get another one instead. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly trying to be the adult in a situation where people aren\u2019t acting all that appropriately, and congratulations on that. It can be hard to maintain your boundaries when people around you have poor ones. I recommend that you be kind, but don\u2019t be too open with her. And really, have a private conversation with your dad about what he\u2019s going to do to make sure that she\u2019s not eavesdropping in the future.  I recommend that you mention to him that you were simply sharing your feelings at the time, and that what he does is his business. Nobody can control how you feel towards your stepmom. You are simply trying to make sure that she has all of her needs met. And then drop it.", "NTA", "NAH other than your overbearing dad, who believes it's acceptable to tell others how to feel.  Your feelings are entirely valid and don't let anyone pressure you into changing them; hers are too, but she's not entitled to anything you're not willing to volunteer.  \n\nWe define others' relationships to us, not ours to them (that's for them to decide).", "You've learned an important life lesson.

Jess can love you with all her heart and soul but that doesn\u2019t mean you owe her anything. Your parents are both overreacting and creating an issue when they should be planning and celebrating. Tons of kids resent their stepparents. Your Dad should be happy you and Jess have a friendship at all. You weren\u2019t even the one who called it her first Christmas as a Mom - her family did and you simply echoed it.", "NTA - it was a lose/lose situation and you were honest.  Someone could've/would've been offended either way you responded.", "NAH - No one can force themselves to feel anything, despite what some people seem to think. \n\nPeople have said it mostly already but I will add one thing, Jess had your little brother in September, so, chances are her body is still dealing with the hormone changes that being pregnant, having a baby and then not being pregnant anymore causes, one of the side effects is that some women can have an increased emotional reaction for several months after having a baby and I suspect that is at least partly responsible for how she reacted.", "YTA - what you failed to pick up on is that when her family made the comment about it being her first Christmas as a mom, she jumped to defend YOU. Her family was essentially drawing a line between the two of you, and she wouldn't let them toss you aside like that. She was honouring her role in your life, and yours in her life, by saying it wasn't her first Christmas as a mom. I even doubt that it was really about the mom TITLE so much as the mom ROLE (based on your own comments). \n\nYou don't need to assign her the mom title. She will never replace your bio-mom, who will always have that title in your life. However, by your own admission, she has been filling the mom ROLE for most of your life. THAT'S why this was such a slap in the face. You don't need to be any more affectionate or outwardly loving than you're comfortable with, but you can't explain away her years of dedication and love for you as anything less than what it was - her taking on the mother role in your life. So no, this is not her first Christmas as a mom. It's baby's first Christmas, which is how this whole thing should have been framed, but it is not her first Christmas as a mom and what you said was incredibly, incredibly hurtful. You owe her an apology.", "NTA. You have a good heart for trying to encourage the parental relationship your stepmom will (should) have with her own child. You are being brave and honest about your own feelings and you shouldn't be faulted for that.\n\n However, you may someday change your mind about how you describe your relationship with this woman. She may not be your mother, but those are often big shoes to fill. When you are older, maybe raising your children, you may look back and rethink your relationship as more parental than Aunt. It may be worth the effort now to try smoothing things over.", "I think you are NTA because Jess was eavesdropping and what you said wasn\u2019t meant for her. Also, she knows how you feel from therapy, so even if she is disappointed she shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is this \u201cgoing all out for her first Christmas as a mom\u201d. Did you get crappy presents from her? Did she cook regular day-to-day food? I\u2019m not criticizing you, but I want to know what more could she or your dad do that they hadn\u2019t done before with just you. Do you mean your dad should give her an extra special present?", "NTA. You\u2019re still a kid and (it sounds like) you\u2019re still dealing with a lot of complicated feelings.

Not saying your dad remarried too fast, just speculating that maybe somewhere inside your 9yo mind you felt like he did. \n\nIt sounds like your stepmom has been good to you and loves you.

It's sometimes one of the most unrewarding things. We always see posts of evil step-parents alienating their partners bio kids. I'm not saying you're evil or anything...\n\nBut I can't imagine being in her shoes and hearing that. Dedicating all their time and effort to someone that doesn't love them back. Looking at your post she seems to not just have loved you  but literally took care of you half your life with the only thing missing was the blood to be called a mom.... \n\nYou're entitled not to love people back, you're entitled not to call her mom but words do hurt and you knew that would hurt her. Sucks for her in this situation...\n\nI hope her kid they have fills the void you can't fulfill nd I hope you don't experience this as well if you ever decide to have kids or be a step parent one day.", "This is weird.

I don't think you are wrong for feeling this way at all, but I understand for them how these comments feel like back handed compliments.\n\nhave you considered that your family might be trying to make her feel like she didn't belong? that only now she has a family? Just because she's not your mom didn't mean she's not family. that's not a nice way to treat an aunt, either. Just some food for thought", "This is a tough one my dude. \n\nYour thoughts and feelings are completely valid - no one is ever going to replace your Mom. She will always have a special place in your heart. It sounds like Jess has given you a lot of space and has been caring and nurturing as well and I can see how she was hurt by your words. I think your delivery of the message it's what's at issue here. I think you could have conveyed your feelings without being as harsh on Jess as you were but I don't blame you for being blunt either. \n\nI think a way you be able to reconcile or at least try to mend the relationship with both your Dad and Jess is to explain why you feel this way. Losing your Mom at such a young age must have been very impactful. You could speak to that. Most importantly though, you do need to let Jess know how much you appreciate her, and that you care for her (if you do feel that way). She's probably feeling utterly abandoned by you right now and doesn't understand why you feel this way. \n\nHave you talked to a counselor or therapist about this? They might be better equipped to help you find a way to tell Jess you appreciate her for everything she's done while simultaneously explaining she'll never be able to replace your Mom. \n\nI'm sorry buddy, for everything you're going through.

I don\u2019t think you were wrong for agreeing that her family should go all out for her, just for the fact that she does now have her first biological child after having miscarriages, I just think it came off the wrong way.

I get that she wanted to fill what she saw as an empty space, but it wasn't empty. It was never empty, or vacant.

I love my SD because as an adult I realize how freaking tough it was to love me, to sacrifice for me, to put my needs above his own and get very little for it. I also developed a more comprehensive understanding of relationships as an adult, that you can love people differently, can value what they do for many reasons, can hold multiple ppl in the same spaces without disrespecting anyone.

I'm assuming that since you acknowledge that she treats you well and never pushed anything on you that you know she deserves more consideration than an aunty or uncle who doesn't wash your dirty undies.

It doesn\u2019t make this her \u201cfirst\u201d christmas as a mom, because to her, she\u2019s been in that role even if you don\u2019t label her that way. It had to be a kick to the gut to hear that, and her feelings of the situation matter. Her having a bio child doesn\u2019t suddenly erase you from her heart, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re suddenly booted out of being considered her child. It\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t see her as your mom, you\u2019ve made that clear to her but that doesn\u2019t have to change her feelings either. It sounds like she\u2019s been pretty respectful of your boundaries on the matter. But from the sounds of your post and comments I feel like you think your brother will suddenly make her not consider you as her own. Like you\u2019ll suddenly be forgotten about and honestly if she\u2019s as nice as you say, that probably won\u2019t be the case. However there might of been a shift in the relationship because of what you said. \nAnd just because I\u2019m curious, and I know you\u2019re only 16, but if/when you have children, will she be called some form of \u201cgrandma\u201d or will she not get that honorific?

So, as someone else suggested, shift the focus from it being her first xmas as a mom to it being the baby first xmas, which is true without being insulting to her feelings and without you having to keep stating she isn't mom to you.\n\nAnd do tell her that even if she isn't mom to you because you only had one mom, she is still family and you love her in that capacity. That she will forever be your half-sibling mom and your dad's partner and someone important to you that you can rely on. \n\nThat might not be everything she wants but it can go a long way to mend the fences.", "Kids at a certain age and maturity have some responsibility as well. This sub seems to think kids can't do any wrong. OP's life is objectively better having step mom in it vs dad staying single. I'm sure dad would have been fine by himself but having two capable guardians beats having one. Also the level of expectation people have about step parents in this sub. They should do all the work that a bio parent would have but expect nothing back for it. Who'd want to sign up for that?! \n\n\nOP is old enough to have some awareness of this and be more tactful to his step mom. I get a strong vibe of \u201cI don't really need her\u201c from some of OP's posts.", "OP explicitly says she never did that.", "Reading your post then your replies, it sounds like you go out of your way to make it known to her to your dad and everyone that she is not nor ever will be your mother. Your feelings are valid, totally fine but are you sure there isn\u2019t any other feelings there? Any feelings of resentment? If I was indifferent about someone, I would just let them do as they want. They want to identify as my mom sure idc. But that\u2019s me and I don\u2019t have a step mom to relate or have an opinion to that position", "OP is half my age. It's totally fine to not really know how to feel, or how to phrase things. It's also fine to not be ready (yet) for some of the thought process behind my appreciation for my stepmother!\n\nI was an adult when I met her. It was clear she would never become my 'second mom'. I had time to get to know her as she was, and to see her as the partner of my dad.\n\nI was able to see how happy she makes him. He even took her last name! My old Macho dad!\n\nI have a wedding picture of them framed with the family pictures. They are sitting on a bench, she has her eyes closed as she leans on his shoulder, and he smiles like the happiest man on earth.\n\nI love her a lot just for making him smile like this.", "My daughter has a step-dad she calls by first name. Sometimes she calls him dad.\n\nWe always encouraged her to pick what feels right to her.\n\nShe sometimes corrects when he's labelled as her dad, sometimes not.\n\nHer biological father doesn't mind. They are close friends even!\nWhen I asked 8 years ago if he would be fine of my new partner being a step-dad to her, his answer was (quote):\n\"Another adult who wants to share responsibility, and care for her? Why would I be against it?!\"", "The more, the merrier!", "It's all relative. For many years growing up, I was way closer to my aunt than my mom. She was my mom's youngest sibling, and she was only 14 years older than  me, so she was more like a sister. I told her all my secrets, we giggled over crushes and showed each other photos of guys we liked. I would say if you asked me when I was 16 if I loved my mom or my aunt more, I would've picked my aunt, hands down. My mom was not the best parent. In fact, I always say she never should've had kids. She was pressured by society to have them. She's much happier now that none of her kids are dependent on her anymore. I'm much closer to her as an adult than I was as a child. Some people are just not great parents. So just because someone thinks of a mother figure as an aunt doesn't mean it's a slight!", "It's valid to not see her as your mother but...\n\nPeople here are telling you to choose your words in describing your relationship and again you seek to minimise her presence in your life and declare her not your mother.\n\nIts a really unkind and hurtful approach. If you truly want to hurt her, continue on this path.\n\nIf that isn't your goal.\n\nPeople are telling you to look at the relationship you do have with her and tell her about what you value in your relationship.\n\nOthers in this thread are telling you a new mother figure does not replace your biological mum and you can accept and value what she brings.\n\nThe way you've acted means if you aren't trying to hurt her and do appreciate her role in your life, your now going to have to put effort in rebuilding that relationship.", "Hallmark started in the early 1900s as a greeting card company. They then expanded to have retail stores with cards and all sorts of little gifts and tchotchkes. They apparently started doing made-for-tv movies in the 1950s, but it became a much bigger thing in the last 20 years or so.", "It\u2019s also a retail chain of greeting card/gift stores.  \nAlso, fun fact, they own the Crayola brand (crayons, markers, arts and craft supplies)", "Being a step parent is extremely hard balancing act. I tried to act like an aunt rather than another mother, because I wasn\u2019t the mother. I gave love, guidance and tried not to overstep into the roll of a parent. I never once expected to be called mom. The problem here is that OPs stepmom decided she wanted to be mom and not stepmom.", "There is nothing to say she was eavesdropping. If they were speaking loudly in the same house, she might have just heard it. Overhearing does not always equal eavesdropping.", "Help?! She's been the second most important person in his life for the past 9 years! It's totally valid not to see her as mom. That's completely the child's choice. At a certain point though, if she's acting like a mother figure to you and doing a good job at it, and it goes on for years, you're being a dick by wutholding seeing her as a parent.", "If you hear someone having a personal conversation you walk away, that was on her, he thought it was just him and his dad, these doesnt even seem to be malicious intent in his words", "They already said in the post they do, just not like a mom.", ">At a certain point though, if she's acting like a mother figure to you and doing a good job at it, and it goes on for years, you're being a dick by wutholding seeing her as a parent.\n\nHardly.  No one should obligated to feel any particular way just because another person feels entitled to it.  This is especially true where the relationship is imposed on a minor who has no agency in the matter.", "Over time, real and active appreciation leads to a stronger kind of love than OP has expressed anywhere in this thread. Even if he doesn't see his stepmother as a mother, he would have stronger feelings than evidenced here IMO.\n\nAnd your electricity comparison is pretty apt because by golly, I'd bet money that you don't actually think about it much at all - certainly not compared to how often you need and use it.", "Depending on how loud they were talking, if the door was open, etc., she might have had to leave the house. With an infant. \n\nIt\u2019s not reasonable to assume you can have full volume conversations about someone who also loves in your house, even if you think they aren\u2019t there. You need to take precautions like closing the door or speaking quietly. It\u2019s a good lesson for OP to learn.", "Real and active appreciation does not lead to a stronger kind of love in all cases. I can appreciate people for things and actively think they're terrible people. This may be the case for you but not everyone has to conform to your way of thinking. \n\nI agree my comparison is very apt, thank you."]}
