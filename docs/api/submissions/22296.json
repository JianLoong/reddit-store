Just a phone call to come and do stuff. If I said I was in the middle of something and that I would be over in a few it wasn't good enough. All week I was subjected to my dad's crappy behavior and yelling and to my mom's outburst of anger and frustration. Never said a thing, just trying to be a good daughter.

I said I was heading out with a friend, which was met with a death stare. \n\nFriday afternoon I drove mom to my cousin's place to get that stuff printed. Around 8PM I said I'd like to head home so I could get some dinner. Mom was ready to go around 9:30PM when the place was already closed.\n\nThis morning I was awoken by a phonecall to come and get my dad some food. So I did. Got yelled at by both. So I texted Jack I'm taking time off and it's up to him. He sent back bunch of cry laughing emojis saying it doesn't work that way and that he's at a party. I told him he needs to sort it out.

But you do.  He's probably just protecting himself which he actually has the right to do, as do you.\n\nRegardless, your mom needs some external help and she's likely eligible for it.  Have a look at what is available in your area and there is probably more than you know about.\n\nIf your dad needs a higher level of care than your mom can provide (even with external supports) then your mom may have some difficult decisions to make.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire so that your dad can continue to live at home.", "NTA, do this more often.", "Please find some help.   Good on you to make your brother step up, I hope he does.   Next week it is time to sit down with mom and have a real conversation about assistance.  She will resist.  You will point out that you are getting old and it is becoming difficult for you to do it all.   Check with county services, they may be eligible for help through one of the agencies.\n\nDementia sucks, I know my dad had it.  My mom hesitated to put him in a special place.   I pointed out to her that dad barely recognized any of the kids or grand kids anymore, she was doing it all and it was killing her.  So soon, I would have a dead mom and a dad who had no idea who I was.   That was the gentle slap she needed to realize it was time to make sure he was safe and secure and she wasn\u2019t slowly dying.  My parents were your parents ages at the time.    There is no shame in asking for help.  There is no shame in putting a loved one in a place designed for those with memory problems.", "NTA but this is happening because you allow it. Everyone else in this situation is doing what they need to protect themselves but you. Jack doesn\u2019t want to have his life constantly interrupted so he says no or makes sure he isn\u2019t the reliable option by not responding immediately or consistently. Your mom recognizes that you\u2019ll never say no and that the fastest way to get what she wants is to call you. So she does. Meanwhile, you interrupt whatever you are doing for them, you make multiple trips so she never learns to consolidate her requests, you don\u2019t enforce boundaries about the time you have available to do what she wants, so you are tired and burned out. \n\nYou need to have a frank conversation with her to make clear that you are not going to be on call 24/7. Tell her exactly what you are and aren\u2019t going to do. Do not include Jack in this because he will gang up with your mom to pressure you to keep the status quo. If your mom sees how reluctant he is to help she will fight harder too because she\u2019ll see firsthand how difficult her life is going to be without you waiting on her each day. As for those boundaries? Maybe that means assigning one day a week or 2 hours a week that you come over and your mom can ask for whatever she wants. But that\u2019s it. She needs to plan, she needs to prioritize. And beyond that? It\u2019s up to her to figure it out. If Jack doesn\u2019t pick up? Not your problem. If he cancels? Not your problem.  You are not being selfish to say no from now on and you need to harden your heart because they will 100% blame you for not continuing to make their lives easier. There isn\u2019t going to be any sort of apology or acknowledgment that they are abusing your kind nature.", "You are absolutely NTA, Op, and from one daughter of parents who needed (wanted to some extent, at least in my case) this level of care, I get it. Your story touched a nerve as for years I was in your position until I set a boundary my parents (mother especially) did not like. Then it was my brother dropping everything at 8 pm to drive 20 minutes to get them subway.\n\nI thought about going into detail here, but this is about your situation and not mine. What I do want to say is that no adult child is required to care for their parents to this level. I get the sense from what you wrote there is a mixed bag of really needing help (covering things in plastic) and learned helplessness (printing out docs). The bit about having a man be present for the workers is something my mom did often. \n\nI can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you it is only going to get harder and more frustrating from here. Looking into a caregiver to provide relief would be something I'd strongly recommend. Not a nurse, but someone who can come in a few times a week to do a lot of the things your mom has you doing. Even just cooking and cleaning. I'd love to hear you say one day that there was a balance between quality time spent with your mom and time spent assisting her. I tried and was unable to get my parents on board with this, had to go almost NC with them for my own mental health, and, in the end, there was a lot of anger and hurt that I'm working on through therapy.\n\nI wish you the best, OP. Good luck.", "NAH.  You and your mom are overwhelmed and Jack has 3 kids.  All of you deserve downtime.  And to be honest it sounds like Jack is better at setting boundaries with the parents.  Your father clearly needs a lot of help, but you and your mom shouldn't be flagellating yourselves to give it to him all the time.", "NTA - you definitely need the time and space for yourself, but Jack will never step up. For one thing, you're \"the girl,\" so it's your job. For another, Jack seems to have perfected the \"I'm here to help when least needed\" skill, and creatively manages to avoid doing anything. He's completely unreliable. \n\nIt appears you've reached the point where you may need to hire professionals to come in and help your mom. One of the benefits from my dad's frequent hospital stays was that they assigned us nurses for at-home care for a few weeks for rehab. They would bathe him, feed him, change the sheets on the bed, and watch him so my mom could go to the store, take a shower, or go to church. Even simply sitting with him so she could get stuff done around the house was a huge help. \n\nI feel for you, as I was in a similar situation with my dad. I also think it's time for you to remove Jack from the list of potential help. It's adding a great deal of stress to your lives to always maintain that hope that Jack might man up this time and actually help, then experience the disappointment of another no-show. Just pretend he doesn't exist, because he won't get better. It will be harder to get your mom to come around to this way of thinking, but Jack's made it clear he wants none of this. Let him have what he wants, and remove that source of stress. You have enough. (I have a sister like this, and I can attest that it was better after we removed her from the list. Be prepared for Pikachu face, though, when they discover that they weren't \"trEatEd liKe FamiLy!\")\n\nGood luck!", "NTA - you are their child not their caretaker. It seems like a tough family dynamic all around.\n\nIn more practical things you can do today: if you are in the U.S. please consider going with your parents to their next GP visit. With dementia they should qualify for at least two visits per week from an in home caregiver. It\u2019s not a lot but it\u2019s a start. \n\nMaybe your brother can start ordering good and sending it to their home. It can be ready to eat meals from a supermarket or a restaurant. He can pay for a cleaning service to come in weekly, etc. His time would be super valuable but rather than judging him for not having it he can pitch in by providing the support services. \n\nTalk to him directly - you sound incredibly strong but even the strongest among us break eventually. You deserve some peace and space", "I might get downvoted here but you\u2019re kinda TA to yourself here.  You do not owe anybody all of this up and down and being at everyone\u2019s beck and call.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve been doing it, and resenting it, and then you explode and just stop without warning, you\u2019re kinda the asshole to yourself and definitely to your parents who don\u2019t have a second option (mistly because you\u2019ve never given them a reason to have to figure that out even if it should have been done).\n\nAnd of course your brother should have done more but randomly texting \u201cyour turn\u201d and being non contactable is bizarre: I sympathise, but if Jack doesn\u2019t show up, then what?\n\nESH - time to communicate and stop doing things you don\u2019t actually want to do \ud83e\udee0", "You have quit on your life to be your parents lifeline.

Your father won't know where he is and it's by far the kindest thing for your mother (and, by extension, for you and your brother too). Just because your father's mental and physical health is gone doesn't mean your life is gone (or your mother's or your brother's).

A PSW or other support staff can be a huge help with stuff like that, and give your mom an hour or so of time to herself. Ultimately this will make all of you less stressed and dad will be better taken care of. It might be what mom needs to realise she does need help with dad. Caretaker burnout is real, but she isn't helping anyone by paying it forward to you. \n\nI would sit down with your family and say \"I need a break. Jack, when is the best times for you to be available for mom if she needs some errands run?\" And then be firm. I wouldn't accept less than 3 days a week of \"off time\". If Jack can't fill one or more of those days, then looks like your mom needs to find someone else to help or she can write it down and get it done the next day one of you is available. \n\nSince you are not great at boundaries and you *and* your family are guilting you for not being on call 24/7, this time needs to be strictly enforced: phone off, on mute and in another room, you in another state, whatever. If the anxiety/guilt is too bad, take your dog on a hike a couple hours away, so that even if they manage to get ahold of you, you can honestly say you can't help. And then realise at the end of the day that even though you were not available that day, *nothing truly bad happened*. Everyone in your family is safe and as healthy as before, and your mom might be ticked but she won't disown you. \n\nI would also suggest therapy. You seem to feel responsible for holding your parents' life together even though you resent what it requires of you and don't seem to have had a great relationship with your dad even before all this. Maybe explore why you feel responsible for everything - are your parents truly so helpless that printing out a page of paper requires you to do it for them rather than let them figure it out themselves, or is it just easier? \n\nIf it helps, setting boundaries for people is a lot like setting boundaries for dogs. If you want your dog to stop begging at the table, stop feeding him every time he does.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to look at putting them into a home where people are paid to care for them. Your father can no longer care for himself, and your mom can\u2019t do everything herself either.it\u2019s good to help your parents, but it\u2019s also ok to have your own life.", "My aunt had the foresight to purchase long term care insurance for her and her husband. After she passed he ended up in memory care. Without the long term care insurance she purchased for them at 50 I have no idea what any of us would have doen with him.\n\nHer sister and her husband didn't purchase it and are paying through the nose for care.", "I agree with this.\n\nSometimes all of the \"back up\" has to step back and let Mom and Dad feel the weight of their responsibilities and the weight of \"no one can help\" in order to realize that they need to bring in actual paid help to relieve some of the burden.\n\nOP, this schedule and pace is going to make you ill. I'm not kidding. I was in your shoes and ended up VERY ill - think mono - because of the caretaking while having young kids and a job. \n\nIf you reach that point of burnout where your body is failing, or your mother does, neither of you will be any good to anyone. \n\nAs for your Dad's food  - look into meals on wheels.", "This. My SIL fought us tooth and nail in putting MIL into an assisted living facility. It was terrible - but the writing was on the wall that MIL's mental health was failing very quickly and we live 30 minutes away - just far enough to not be able to help at a moments notice. It took a serious fall and injury for her to go into a nursing home and that made the transition to assisted living seamless... my SIL was FURIOUS that we forced the issue but honestly? My MIL rode out covid in the assisted living quite happily - had she been home I don't think she would have made it due to the loneliness.\n\nOP, if there is ANY way you guys can afford it, it would be worth looking at either bringing in care or moving your father into an assisted living facility. Your Mom is exhausted. She needs someone to come to the house several days per week to help with your Dad. Look into whether medicare can help fund it.", "Lollll what a laugh, teens are ridiculous.\n\nNo matter that person's age mentally they definitely were not an adult \ud83d\ude02", "paintball and party sound like it was probably a kid's birthday party. If it was his kid, it was absolutely the right thing to do to prioritize that.", "Oh, I agree there are probably reams of data we're missing here, but all we have is the info OP provided. Given what we know her parents are needy, not necessarily manipulative. You have a point that we don't know the full history, but that goes both ways. From OP's perspective yes, Jack is a bit of an AH for not finding a way to help even if at a distance.\n\nI agree with you that they are being too reactive. That's why I think Jack need to make the arrangements for assistance. He sounds like the only family member who's got enough distance to see the problem and provide constructive assistance that does not leave him at his parent's beck and call.", ">No, OP is not free to do the same, because she is a responsible person and knows her parents cannot cope on their own.\n\nOr she is co-dependent.\n\nIf they can afford to replace windows then they can afford to hire a care giver.", "If Jack had her back, even if he knew his limits & knew he could not or would not help his parents directly, he would discuss this with OP & talk about why he wasn't helping & solutions to not leave it all on her. \n\nOtherwise he's like the person helping you carry a piano who drops their end suddenly & runs off. Both you & the piano get screwed in this scenario.", "Having so many needs pressed upon you sounds rough.\n\nHaving so much abuse, lack of kindness or gratitude, and hostility sounds super brutal. \n\nI'd start off by making a defining line, they can have one or the other, but not both. Help or harassment (bossing and yelling at me), but not both.\n\nNow they've grown accustomed to having their concierge and entitlement too, and it will be a difficult adjustment. I did this with my folks.\n\nRaised voices, commands, not listening back, arguing limits, I'd say goodbye and we try again the next day. Hang up or leave. Yes, things that needed done didn't get done as fast, but that was because they were belaboring the process by being disrespectful. \n\nI reminded them they brought me up that you treat people with respect, use manners and to stick up for myself. Still stands.\n\nThere is something called an extinction burst. It's like turning the ignition of your car. If it doesn't start right up, I guarantee you EVERYONE will try again. Every single person ever. Usually several times. When something that always worked before stops working, we humans add more energy to getting the old pattern to work before we will adapt and do something else. Moral of the story - it's going to get worse before it gets better. It is a natural process, but if you stick to your limits and be fair, it will work. No one stays in the car for 48 hours straight and keeps trying the ignition only. Hold through the extinction burst and make progress and be supportive when they change too. Offer constructive alternatives, offer compromise, and sometimes they're just going to hear no if they demand, and need to learn to cooperate appropriately. \n\nMake at least 2 days you are out of reach unless it's an emergency. Those days your brother can be the go to, or things can wait. Give yourself some relief. Maybe bro isn't totally unreliable, he just makes some room for his other priorities too and they resent that instead of respecting it and dump it all on you. You got the stink eye for not dropping everything for them instantly too, but that wasn't fair dear. If they can't appreciate all you do, be kind, patient, collaborative, and make your needs a portion of their priority too, then you'll need to work just as hard at ensuring that balance is met and enforced another way. \n\nYou're doing good, you made a very good first step. You still love them and will still contribute a lot of support to them, just don't sacrifice yourself to do so, find that balance. \n\nLike the cousins house, you had a chance to say, I'm leaving in X minutes, will take you home or cousin can take you instead, which will she choose? Make fair limits and give options that include you too. \n\nYou can still be good to them and be good to yourself too. It really is fair.", "If OP's parents have decent savings or a reasonable health plan, they may be able to find a combined-care community where Mom and Dad can still live together, but have assistance close by whenever it's needed, or where Dad can be in a memory-care unit that Mom can walk to from a small apartment unit.", "Sorry, but did you read where he said he was busy paintballing, and at a party? I have 3 children (and a mother with Alzheimer's that now lives in a facility) and I know for a fact he's using those kids as an excuse. He could definitely help more than he is. Of course they need to hire some assistance, and dad probably need to be placed in a facility, buy the brother is a selfish jerk who I'd bet doesn't even help his wife with the kids as often as he should...", "Depending on where they live some places can come after adult children for the cost of caring for their parents if the state is forced to fund it. That's not common though so he likely has no legal responsibility to care for his parents.\n\nWhy do I get the impression that he has an expectation that he will share equally in any inheritance though?", "This sort of thing needs to be talked about more.  I was my grandmother's full-time, live-in caregiver.   When I tried to tell people that she was getting increasingly cruel and abusive, I was told to stop exaggerating.  Trying to explain the issue of her breaking the dishes was immediately assumed to be a simple matter of getting clumsy in her old age, rather than deliberately throwing them on the ground because she thought I was taking too long to wash them. \n\nI just wanted to be able to finish eating my own dinner first, or wait for the pot from the stove to cool off.  She never considered this an excuse.  One time, she picked up a pot lid that had been left on the element (using a pot holder, ffs), and passed it to me when I was doing the dishes.\n\nShe was somehow able to turn on the charm when we had guests.  When I was finally able to convince the rest of the family that I couldn't handle her on my own, the woman who came to assess the level of care she needed completely missed the mark.\n\nThe very nice low-assistance home that allowed their residents some independence kicked her out after two days.  The one she was sent to after that was the kind that had codes to unlock the doors and enough staff to wrangle her.\n\nFun surprise: Her \"favorite\" attendant (aka the one she yelled for when she needed something) turned out to be a guy who bullied me in junior high!", "I assume he has a partner assisting with the childcare. Given his misogynistic attitude to providing care for his parents if his partner is female, he likely contributes the bare minimum there too.\n\nBrother is fine to abdicate his filial responsibilities if he sees fit. Provided he accepts he has no claim on any inheritance that maybe left. If he wishes to exploit his sisters child free status to his advantage it should come with a price attached.", "NTA. You can't help anyone if you burn yourself out, selfcare is just as important. Your brother absolutely is, he needs to grow up. Kind of sounded like he has three kids at home and is out partying? Is that the norm? Your mother I'd need more information on to judge, was she like this before or is she falling apart because the stress of caring for your dad is too much? They need an actual home care aid or your dad needs to go into a home, this whole situation is so unsustainable.", "INFO. Why couldn't the people doing the windows move any furniture or cover things in plastic? Are your parents too hardup to pay for this, or is it more a case of \"won't pay because daughter will do it\"? Enjoy your time off, sounds like you need it.", "NAH. Speaking as someone who took care of a grandparent with dementia for seven years, you're ALL doing the best you can but clearly at the end of your rope.\n\nMy years of experience as a caregiver lead me to working professionally in this field and I get it. There's stigma about putting a loved one in a nursing home. But your dad has a disease, and he is rapidly deteriorating towards a point where he will be a danger to himself. It will be less cruel to find a home for him now while he can still adapt to new living conditions than wait until the last minute when he's too far gone.", "OP, please read this and get help. You are at risk of burning out.", "They\u2019ll learn. And thank you for the heart, friend.", "Yes, and it means he still gets to be the good guy because he's pretending that he wants to help, but he's just too busy.", "Parents chose to have kids and looks after them, kids aren\u2019t under any obligation to help out their parents.\n\nI would help mine out rather than go to paintball but if someone doesn\u2019t want to then I don\u2019t judge them, that\u2019s their life and they\u2019re allowed to make their own choices. They don\u2019t have to put their life/their fun on hold to look after their elderly relatives.", "No I didn\u2019t miss it. I just think that he\u2019s allowed to want to go to a party or to paintball rather than look after his elderly parents. He doesn\u2019t have to help out. Would it be nice of him to help out with his parents? Yes of course it would be but he doesn\u2019t have to. And this Reddit is always full of people saying that no is a full sentence and you don\u2019t have to do things for other people if you don\u2019t want to but now suddenly we\u2019re demanding that this guy spend his evenings and weekends looking after his mum and dad?", "These are his parents. Decent people help their parents if they can when these type of situations arise. She, the sister, doesn't have to help either, but she does. No one said spend all his free time there, just help them out more often than he does. I'm sure if this were to happen to him he'd be pissed if his children did him the way he's doing his parents. But ultimately you're right; he doesn't HAVE to help. No one does. No one HAS to do anything. We can all be as selfish as we want to be in life. But if we wanna be like that, make sure we're willing to suffer the consequences, and there are always consequences for selfish jerks. Like, his parents might leave more money/stuff to the sister when they die so he better not complain. And, what's happening with his parents might happen to him so he better be okay when his kids don't want to help. As long as he (and people like him) deal with the consequences like a champ, no problems. There are usually enough kind and giving people around to pick up the slack.", "You & the OP seem to have different values and beliefs regarding the roles adult children play in providing for their sick parents /gen. Given that kids are expected to help out, there's no reason for Jack not to contribute. \n\nI agree with your last sentence. When I discuss misogyny, it is because of the logic in the comment I'm replying to."]}
