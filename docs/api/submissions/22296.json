Just a phone call to come and do stuff. If I said I was in the middle of something and that I would be over in a few it wasn't good enough. All week I was subjected to my dad's crappy behavior and yelling and to my mom's outburst of anger and frustration. Never said a thing, just trying to be a good daughter. Thursday evening mom called me to come help her move some stuff. I came, moved it and was told I can go back to work. I said I was heading out with a friend, which was met with a death stare. \n\nFriday afternoon I drove mom to my cousin's place to get that stuff printed. Around 8PM I said I'd like to head home so I could get some dinner. Mom was ready to go around 9:30PM when the place was already closed.\n\nThis morning I was awoken by a phonecall to come and get my dad some food. So I did. Got yelled at by both. So I texted Jack I'm taking time off and it's up to him. He sent back bunch of cry laughing emojis saying it doesn't work that way and that he's at a party. I told him he needs to sort it out.

But you do.  He's probably just protecting himself which he actually has the right to do, as do you.\n\nRegardless, your mom needs some external help and she's likely eligible for it.  Have a look at what is available in your area and there is probably more than you know about.\n\nIf your dad needs a higher level of care than your mom can provide (even with external supports) then your mom may have some difficult decisions to make.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire so that your dad can continue to live at home.", "NTA, do this more often.", "Please find some help.   Good on you to make your brother step up, I hope he does.   Next week it is time to sit down with mom and have a real conversation about assistance.  She will resist.  You will point out that you are getting old and it is becoming difficult for you to do it all.   Check with county services, they may be eligible for help through one of the agencies.\n\nDementia sucks, I know my dad had it.  My mom hesitated to put him in a special place.   I pointed out to her that dad barely recognized any of the kids or grand kids anymore, she was doing it all and it was killing her.  So soon, I would have a dead mom and a dad who had no idea who I was.   That was the gentle slap she needed to realize it was time to make sure he was safe and secure and she wasn\u2019t slowly dying.  My parents were your parents ages at the time.    There is no shame in asking for help.  There is no shame in putting a loved one in a place designed for those with memory problems.", "NTA but this is happening because you allow it. Everyone else in this situation is doing what they need to protect themselves but you. Jack doesn\u2019t want to have his life constantly interrupted so he says no or makes sure he isn\u2019t the reliable option by not responding immediately or consistently. Your mom recognizes that you\u2019ll never say no and that the fastest way to get what she wants is to call you. So she does. Meanwhile, you interrupt whatever you are doing for them, you make multiple trips so she never learns to consolidate her requests, you don\u2019t enforce boundaries about the time you have available to do what she wants, so you are tired and burned out. \n\nYou need to have a frank conversation with her to make clear that you are not going to be on call 24/7. Tell her exactly what you are and aren\u2019t going to do. Do not include Jack in this because he will gang up with your mom to pressure you to keep the status quo. If your mom sees how reluctant he is to help she will fight harder too because she\u2019ll see firsthand how difficult her life is going to be without you waiting on her each day. As for those boundaries? Maybe that means assigning one day a week or 2 hours a week that you come over and your mom can ask for whatever she wants. But that\u2019s it. She needs to plan, she needs to prioritize. And beyond that? It\u2019s up to her to figure it out. If Jack doesn\u2019t pick up? Not your problem. If he cancels? Not your problem.  You are not being selfish to say no from now on and you need to harden your heart because they will 100% blame you for not continuing to make their lives easier. There isn\u2019t going to be any sort of apology or acknowledgment that they are abusing your kind nature.", "You are absolutely NTA, Op, and from one daughter of parents who needed (wanted to some extent, at least in my case) this level of care, I get it. Your story touched a nerve as for years I was in your position until I set a boundary my parents (mother especially) did not like. Then it was my brother dropping everything at 8 pm to drive 20 minutes to get them subway.\n\nI thought about going into detail here, but this is about your situation and not mine. What I do want to say is that no adult child is required to care for their parents to this level. I get the sense from what you wrote there is a mixed bag of really needing help (covering things in plastic) and learned helplessness (printing out docs). The bit about having a man be present for the workers is something my mom did often. \n\nI can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you it is only going to get harder and more frustrating from here. Looking into a caregiver to provide relief would be something I'd strongly recommend. Not a nurse, but someone who can come in a few times a week to do a lot of the things your mom has you doing. Even just cooking and cleaning. I'd love to hear you say one day that there was a balance between quality time spent with your mom and time spent assisting her. I tried and was unable to get my parents on board with this, had to go almost NC with them for my own mental health, and, in the end, there was a lot of anger and hurt that I'm working on through therapy.\n\nI wish you the best, OP. Good luck.", "NAH.  You and your mom are overwhelmed and Jack has 3 kids.  All of you deserve downtime.  And to be honest it sounds like Jack is better at setting boundaries with the parents.  Your father clearly needs a lot of help, but you and your mom shouldn't be flagellating yourselves to give it to him all the time.", "NTA - you definitely need the time and space for yourself, but Jack will never step up. For one thing, you're \"the girl,\" so it's your job. For another, Jack seems to have perfected the \"I'm here to help when least needed\" skill, and creatively manages to avoid doing anything. He's completely unreliable. \n\nIt appears you've reached the point where you may need to hire professionals to come in and help your mom. One of the benefits from my dad's frequent hospital stays was that they assigned us nurses for at-home care for a few weeks for rehab. They would bathe him, feed him, change the sheets on the bed, and watch him so my mom could go to the store, take a shower, or go to church. Even simply sitting with him so she could get stuff done around the house was a huge help. \n\nI feel for you, as I was in a similar situation with my dad. I also think it's time for you to remove Jack from the list of potential help. It's adding a great deal of stress to your lives to always maintain that hope that Jack might man up this time and actually help, then experience the disappointment of another no-show. Just pretend he doesn't exist, because he won't get better. It will be harder to get your mom to come around to this way of thinking, but Jack's made it clear he wants none of this. Let him have what he wants, and remove that source of stress. You have enough. (I have a sister like this, and I can attest that it was better after we removed her from the list. Be prepared for Pikachu face, though, when they discover that they weren't \"trEatEd liKe FamiLy!\")\n\nGood luck!", "NTA - you are their child not their caretaker. It seems like a tough family dynamic all around.\n\nIn more practical things you can do today: if you are in the U.S. please consider going with your parents to their next GP visit. With dementia they should qualify for at least two visits per week from an in home caregiver. It\u2019s not a lot but it\u2019s a start. \n\nMaybe your brother can start ordering good and sending it to their home. It can be ready to eat meals from a supermarket or a restaurant. He can pay for a cleaning service to come in weekly, etc. His time would be super valuable but rather than judging him for not having it he can pitch in by providing the support services. \n\nTalk to him directly - you sound incredibly strong but even the strongest among us break eventually. You deserve some peace and space", "I might get downvoted here but you\u2019re kinda TA to yourself here.
