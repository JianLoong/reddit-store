{"id": 22296, "submission_id": "150avbg", "title": "AITA for taking a day off and letting my brother deal with our parents for once?", "selftext": "My (46f) dad (81) has dementia. He was always hard to deal with but now he turned into a mean old man, to put it nicely. So mom (75) has a lot on her plate. I am single and live close so I make sure to come by often, call, when I cannot come, and help in anyway I can (taking mom out on day trips, on top of helping with shopping and household chores). \n\nMy brother Jack (42) has three kids and lives about 15 minute drive by car. We both work from home. Jack mostly calls or comes only when he needs something. Mom has pretty much gave up on asking him for anything because he never has time or promises and doesn't deliver. Friday, she needed something related to dad's dementia printed out but didn't want to call Jack because \"He's driving his daughter to a doctor on Monday so I don't want to disturb him.\" \n\nNow onto the problem. My parents' house needed new windows and about a month ago the company mom hired finally told her they would start on Monday, July 10. So on Sunday the top floor of the house needed to be covered in plastic. I came back from vacation on Saturday to do it. Jack couldn't help because he had ~~stuff~~ paintball to do. At 8PM when everything was done he called to ask if we managed to move our parents' ginormous bed with attached nightstands out of the way. \n\nMonday morning Jack came to observe the workers because mom wanted them to see a man there. Tuesday I cancelled my plans to help my mom put the rest of the house under plastic. In the evening I asked Jack if he could come and help me move the grandfather clock. At first he said he couldn't, then said later. When he came he told me the clock is not heavy and why did I need help. \n\nAll week I was on call to get food, bring plates, move this, move that and each time I wasn't given heads up. Just a phone call to come and do stuff. If I said I was in the middle of something and that I would be over in a few it wasn't good enough. All week I was subjected to my dad's crappy behavior and yelling and to my mom's outburst of anger and frustration. Never said a thing, just trying to be a good daughter. Thursday evening mom called me to come help her move some stuff. I came, moved it and was told I can go back to work. I said I was heading out with a friend, which was met with a death stare. \n\nFriday afternoon I drove mom to my cousin's place to get that stuff printed. Around 8PM I said I'd like to head home so I could get some dinner. Mom was ready to go around 9:30PM when the place was already closed.\n\nThis morning I was awoken by a phonecall to come and get my dad some food. So I did. Got yelled at by both. So I texted Jack I'm taking time off and it's up to him. He sent back bunch of cry laughing emojis saying it doesn't work that way and that he's at a party. I told him he needs to sort it out. Texted mom to call Jack for help, that he knows about it. Turned off the phone. Taking my dog and myself for a stroll in the woods and possibly some swimming.

However, this situation is not going to be solved by sending a text and then turning your phone off.\n\nSad to say, but the permanent solution would be to move away.  Not driving distance.  I mean move somewhere that airplane travel would be required to facilitate a weekend visit.", "Update please", "NTA, but also please look into getting assistance if you can. Obviously your brother doesn't give a damn and won't help and you're struggling.", "NTA. However taking a break under the assumption that someone else creates a huge expectation that wont be met by your brother. While taking the break is good and healthy for you, it could be better to assess and tackle the real issue in this situation. The fact is, like other people have pointed out, that taking care of someone with dementia is very very difficult and has dire consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you do.  He's probably just protecting himself which he actually has the right to do, as do you.\n\nRegardless, your mom needs some external help and she's likely eligible for it.  Have a look at what is available in your area and there is probably more than you know about.\n\nIf your dad needs a higher level of care than your mom can provide (even with external supports) then your mom may have some difficult decisions to make.\n\nDon't set yourself on fire so that your dad can continue to live at home.", "NTA, do this more often.", "Please find some help.   Good on you to make your brother step up, I hope he does.   Next week it is time to sit down with mom and have a real conversation about assistance.  She will resist.  You will point out that you are getting old and it is becoming difficult for you to do it all.   Check with county services, they may be eligible for help through one of the agencies.\n\nDementia sucks, I know my dad had it.  My mom hesitated to put him in a special place.   I pointed out to her that dad barely recognized any of the kids or grand kids anymore, she was doing it all and it was killing her.  So soon, I would have a dead mom and a dad who had no idea who I was.   That was the gentle slap she needed to realize it was time to make sure he was safe and secure and she wasn\u2019t slowly dying.  My parents were your parents ages at the time.    There is no shame in asking for help.  There is no shame in putting a loved one in a place designed for those with memory problems."]}
