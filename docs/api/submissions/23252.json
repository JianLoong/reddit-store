My wife stuck with it for a few weeks but ultimately decided to quit\n\nLuckily, this wasn't too much of an issue for me. She's a nurse and frequently works much later than I do as my typical work day is from 6am to 2pm. So I would make my meal prepped meals for the week on on my off day and then I would make dinner like I did prior. When I meal prep, I make 6 days worth of 3 meals. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and just swap around lunch and dinner.\n\nLast week Thursday morning for work and planned on coming back Friday morning and stopping through home, grabbing anything I needed then heading into the office. This was known for weeks in advance, so I didn't spring this on my wife. I figured that she would be able to make sure, she and our kid got dinner that night and breakfast that next morning. The next morning, I'm running late and drive through home looking for my last breakfast and lunch for the week and they're gone. I don't have time to ask my wife, nor do I wanna wake her up early before her shift so I just go. I end up skipping breakfast and lunch. I get off of work and I'm starving and decide I'm just gonna eat dinner early and when I look for my dinner for that night, it's not there.\n\nThis is what set me off, when my wife gets home I ask her what's up and and she admits to eating the meals. I tell her that I had portioned out food for an entire day and and she ate all of it in a single night. She said it was my fault as I didn't make anything for her and our kid to eat and I just left the meal prepped things, so they had to eat those. We got into an argument and she told me I was being selfish. So now I decided that if I'm selfish for expecting her to feed herself for one night, I would just not cook anymore as I'm doing a lot of work for a selfish person. For the past week, I made my meal prep meals and store them at work and let her figure out what she wants do for dinner by herself. Of course I still cook for our kid, but only one portion small enough for him to eat by himself.\n\nI told her I would keep this up and that she should learn to cook for herself if she's not happy about it. She told me that she's too tired when she comes home from work to cook and that I'm being incredibly petty. I think I'm justified and I'm pushing her to learn a life skill she should have by now.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690468866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b3ohm/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_for_my_wife_anymore/", "score": 8185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he still the better cook? 100%. But I can handle my self and our 3 kids. She\u2019s the AH and needs to be called out for weaponized incompetence.

No one's asking for a 5 star 4 course meal.", "Hopping on this comment to note:  there's this whole thing throughout this thread -- this whole post, really -- talking about \"feminists coined 'weaponized incompetence' as a complaint against men\"\n\nCommenter u/hagholda has been particularly prolific in this sort of comment, but they seem to have deleted most of their thoughts on this.\n\nIn fact, this concept has been around a long time, probably forever. It's as simple as my husband wanting a sandwich and saying to me, \"Would you fix it, honey? Your sandwiches are so much better than mine!\" We both know what he's doing, and I love to spoil him, so there's no manipulation going on. And in turn, I remind him that he's \"so much better at taking care of the trash\" than I am.\n\nWhat we today call \"weaponized incompetence\" has also been referred to as \"strategic incompetence\" and \"learned helplessness\" and probably a lot of other things. ALL OF THESE TERMS MEAN THE SAME THING. It's not some newfangled thing that feminists have \"invented\" to bash men; it applies to EVERYONE.\n\nWhen I was in charge of hiring administrative staff at a company, and interviewing a candidate to work in our administrative area, which involved, y'know, typing and stuff:  general office work. She literally could not figure out how to press the \"copy\" button on the copy machine (or so she said!). And so, since she was the daughter of one of the C-suite executives, she was \"promoted\" to the fifth floor and became a much-better-paid analyst. (This sort of thing is why women are sometimes coached to pretend they can't type, or told they should not take a typing class -- that way they can't be relegated to a \"secretary\" job.)\n\nAnyway -- in the situation of this post:  OF COURSE the wife is exhibiting weaponized incompetence, AND strategic incompetence, AND learned helplessness. Barring learning disabilities, it's not hard to put a frozen dinner in the microwave. It's not hard to follow the directions on the back of a package. It's only a tiny bit more difficult to open a can, pour it in a pan, and heat it.\n\nI hope OP continues to let her make her own food.\n\nEdit:  a word", "Must remember that phrase!", "When I started living on my own in college I didn't know how to cook.

It\u2019s not the biggest deal in the world but the least she could have done was acknowledge that she selfishly ate his prepped meals, leaving him without food for that day and made no effort to replace those meals, then on top of that called HIM selfish for not having cooked meals for one night for a grown adult and that adult\u2019s child.

Individually I can cook each dish almost perfect, no problems there, but asking me to get them all cooked and ready at the same time, eh, nah. You get what you're given when it's ready", "My SO does every bit of cooking in our house.  I can cook okay but he prefers to bc he loves doing it.

Copying a story (that was probably also fake) and changing 1-2 details probably is a sign someone is trying to prove a point.

I was astounded when I heard that one, mostly that my sibling tolerated this behaviour for so long.  Literally anyone can toss some pasta in a pot and boil according to package instructions.  You do not need to be a chef or anything, you just have to fucking TRY.  \n\nBy the way, since they divorced, he somehow manages to feed himself.  Because of course he can.", "Agreeing with you and adding that she also could have ordered something"]}
