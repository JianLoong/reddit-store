Was this lady trying to transport it somewhere and got distracted by the second cat? But why not leave it in the house or the car?", "I think it's more a question of \"what idiot left a cat carrier unattended outdoors?\"", "NTA. Here's a story for you. A few years ago, when my fiancee and I were first living together, we lived in a duplex. After a while, a small, somewhat shaggy, collarless cat started hanging around our door and crying constantly. I fed her on the porch a couple of times, and she tried to get in, but I wouldn't let her. We'd seen other cats around (we lived opposite a large park) and they came and went (some were obviously feral) but this little one kept coming back at all hours. \n\nMy fiancee wanted to perhaps adopt her, and one night, the cat got past me and got inside. I thought, well I better check with the neighbors (who were pretty unfriendly) and the back unit said nope, they'd seen the cat around, but they didn't have a clue. Went to the fam in the duplex and the father was pretty hostile. 'Are you trying to steal my daughter's cat,' blah blah. Nope, I said, and caught the cat (not hard, she was sleeping on my couch) and brought her over.\n\nHe was a TOTAL dick about it. I pointed out, no collar, and also, looking a little unkempt. He snarled at me and slammed his door. Next time I saw the cat she had a collar and had been groomed, and she also didn't come around as much (still saw her outside on occasion). It was pretty obvious that he and his wife had decided that the daughter (about 9) was to be soleley responsible for the cat, and hadn't been doing a good job. I did get a half-assed apology from the mom for his behavior ('he was tired') but all he did from then on was glare at us.\n\nPeople sure can be jerks when they feel guilty.", "NTA.  You saved the cat, and it's not unreasonable to think that someone might've had the carrier in a pickup and it fell/blew off.  They could be a hundred miles away before they realized it, so taking the cat to a safe place and getting it chip-checked was very reasonable, and compassionate.", "YTA, you waited a whole 7 minutes and didn't make any attempt to ask where the cat belongs before you declared it \"abandoned\"? \n\nThat's a very short amount of time for you to basically have stood there without actually doing anything beyond just taking the cat home!", "I\u2019d be crying and thanking the person who saved my cat and offering them money. \u201cThank you so much, this was a complete accident, you SAVED MY CAT, you\u2019re a guardian angel, take this money. If you won\u2019t accept the money can I make you cookies? Can I hug you?\u201d while ugly crying.", "WTF is wrong with these people?", "What a psycho.", "Yeah, my kitty's carrier was once blown on its side as I was stding outside the vets and set the carrier down to open the door on a blustery winter day. Poor thing was freaked out. Fortunately the gabapentin was kicking in hard . . .", "I have a little pop up tent that I put my cat in when we're just lounging on the porch. But I'm always next to him and he's never unsupervised.", "Oh yes, all of this.", "Yup, IDENTICAL to mine. I would never leave my cat in this contraption on a very windy day.", "NTA\n\nYou could not just leave that cat in the middle of the road.  Nor alone in a carrier along the side of the road.  You looked for the cat's people and they were nowhere to be found.  You had *no way* to know at that point that it hadn't been intentionally abandoned.\n\nMy dad once saw a guy toss a little black kitten out of the door of his car onto the hot pavement outside a store.  He was horrified and livid and immediately scooped the kitten up and took him to the vet and home - he got the groceries later.  That cat is now a few years old, a bit of a pain in the ass, and *loves* my dad.\n\nYou had no way to know this wasn't the case.  It looked for all the world like it was!  Who, having had a cat carrier blown away, would not *immediately* chase after it?  How long had the cat been unattended in the carrier before it was blown into the street?  You can't just set them down and leave them.  She needed to get it into the car or whatever *before* bringing out the 2nd cat.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "Cats that aren't happy in those carriers can move the entire carrier with them quite easily.", "In Hawaii there's this infamous cliff known for having people pushed off it in a battle and my foster family took me up there once. The winds were so powerful it took all i had to not get knocked over. I can totally see a cat in high gusts of winds getting knocked around", "I held my cat in my lap but she was more interested in the outside scenery than anything and stayed out \ud83d\ude02 i love my cat because she's usually good about staying put when needed (when she's able to she's gone like the wind though) however her sisters aren't so they have to be put in. They like their carriers though so not much of an issue"]}
