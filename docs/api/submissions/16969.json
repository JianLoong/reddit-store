I locked him into my backyard and was calling the number on the collar.  No one was answering so I left a message.  \n\nWhen I went back outside a guy was at my fence screaming that I stole his dog.

I'm a truck driver with a riding cat buddy. I have to have a carrier in case we need to be out of the truck for whatever reason (repairs, breakdowns, etc) and I've been thinking about swapping over to one of those cloth type carriers to save space.
