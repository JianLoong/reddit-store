My brother from what I\u2019ve seen does not help out much; nor does he have a job.

When I\u2019m around my brother and his girlfriend sometimes the baby will be in their room crying and his gf will ask my brother to go see what the issue is and he essentially ignores her. He doesn\u2019t even respond to her or look at her. When he\u2019s asked to change a diaper I haven\u2019t seen him do that either. The only thing I\u2019ve seen him do is prepare a bottle. My other brother had a kid and definitely helped out much more so I had no problem watching their kid when they needed it. However if I\u2019m doing more work than the dad I don\u2019t think I should take the baby. I\u2019m not a mother for a reason and if I want my free time after school I will have it. They call me selfish and an asshole but I truly believe my brother should at the very least get a job and help with his child. I don\u2019t believe I am obligated to do so if he isn\u2019t even helping.

You keep living your life and moving ahead to your goals. Your brother's girlfriend needs to make some hard choices about her and her child's lives.", "NTA. There is a lot happening here, including that ten year age gap. Have you had a calm conversation with your mom about this? Since you're still in school, that should be your priority. Maybe an honest, calm conversation would help this. You could even say on X day(s) between Y and Z time, you will make yourself available to help if you're willing.

Finding a willing babysitter is part of being a responsible parent. It is nice if family helps out, but it isn't a requirement. No one should force anyone else to care for their children. \n\nThey call you names because they can't get you to do what they want, and they are angry. Apparently, they think they are entitled to your free labor.  They chose to become parents, you didn't. They are adults and should be able to find a willing babysitter on their own.", "Your brother sounds like a deadbeat.  That said, ask yourself \"is there a chance you'll want to have a relationship with this kid in 10 or 20 years?\"  If the answer is yes, start now.  The thing is, this kid is not just someone's chore, he's an actual, real-live human being.  Your brother is missing that.\n\nNTA though.  Seriously, dude is a deadbeat.", "Your brother needs to grow up", "NTA. Your brother needs to step up, and your mom needs to stop enabling his lazy ass.", "He sounds like a loser.
