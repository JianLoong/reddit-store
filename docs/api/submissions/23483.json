You are not the asshole for not looking after your siblings all the time, or for leaving home because you don't want to be the permanent babysitter/maid for your parents.\n\n You have a valid reason to be upset and frustrated with them, since they have been exploiting you, neglecting you, and guilt-tripping you for years. They have no right to expect you to sacrifice your own life, dreams, and happiness for their convenience. \n\n1- They have no right to deny you the opportunity to go overseas for a gymnastics program that you worked hard to achieve. \n\n2 - They have no right to call you selfish, when they are the ones who are being selfish and irresponsible. \n\nYou should not feel guilty or regretful for leaving home, or for ignoring their calls and messages.", "NTA you're a teenager that needs to become a teenager focusing on hobbies, sports, extra circulars, school and work. Not a babysitter and your parents seem to not understand that. If that were my parents I would have left as well.", "NTA. Your parents chose to have more kids. You did not. Your siblings are not your responsibility. Are you able to stay with your grandmother for the foreseeable future?", "NTA. Your parents chose to have 6 children so they are responsible for taking care of them. It is NOT selfish to want to better yourself or follow your dreams so dont listen to them. You are in no way obligated to play parent to your younger siblings. Reading the comments I see you may be looking at moving out.. this sounds like the best thing you could do as your parents clearly dont support or appreciate you. Congrats and good luck with your exciting opportunity!!", "NTA, go to your comp and rock it. I am so happy your grandma is there for you. I don\u2019t know what country you live in, so I don\u2019t know what Legal documents you have to prove your identity eg I D card or broth certificate etc. whatever they are if they are with your parents can you  or your grandma get them back safely?", "NTA. Congratulations on winning the spot in the competition! You must be really dedicated to be good enough to compete and win while having all your other responsibilities. Have the best time going. Stay living with grandma. Your parents will regret how they've treated you when they grow up.\n\nBe strong and live your best life. Please update when you win the competition!", "NTA.  Parentification is a form of child abuse.  You are not selfish for not wanting to essentially raise your siblings at 16.  It is not your job to provide all the childcare, that responsibility belongs to your parents.\n\nI have two younger brothers that are 5 and 6 years younger than me.  They were 10 and 11 when I was 16.\n\nI baby sat them occasionally (wasn't more than 2 times a week and usually only for a couple hours or so.), drove them to some soccer and volleyball things when my parents couldn't make it.  But that was it.  I still had time to do my own things with my own friends.  And my parents never assumed I would do these things, they always made sure I had the time and didn't have plans already made.  And they almost always paid me something for it as well. \n\nThis is what a normal teenager is usually expected to do with younger siblings, and some people would say even this was a bit much.  Thing is, I loved hanging out with my brothers, so it was never a hardship.\n\nSo you should not feel guilty for not wanting to be the parent to your siblings and wanting to have your own life. \n\nAt 16 most states recognize the right of the child to live wherever they want.  They won't force you to go back home if you want to live with your grandma.  As for going to the gymnastics thing, they will most certainly require permission from your legal guardian (which is your parents right now).\n\nYou should ask your grandma to see if she can get custody of you, or to help you get emancipated.  This way you wouldn't need your parents permission.", "Thanks for that, and it\u2019s all free like a scholarship type situation even the flights are taken care of, worse part is they knew I was applying for it in the first place.", "She\u2019s already told me to move in, her and my mum haven\u2019t been on the best terms for a while anyway i didn\u2019t know my treatment was part of the reason.", "Thanks for that, and I\u2019m definitely thinking about it just waiting to find out if I need a parental sign off for it.", "That\u2019s ridiculous, if they knew then that\u2019s on them. And as previously stated YOU didn\u2019t tell them to keep popping out kids like it was going out of style, and you also didn\u2019t ask to be born for the sole reason of childcare. \n\nIf your grandma is okay driving you to the airport and whatnot I think you should go. You too deserve to have somethings be about yourself. Unless of course you need parental consent due to your age.", "Ah amazing.  Read up in parentification and get your head round the fact that you did nothing wrong. It is not your job to look after their kids, right now, just look after yourself.", "You *will* need a parent or guardian permission to go.  Ask your Gran about it right away, so she can help you figure out what to do about that.  Do you have a passport, and do you have it with you?  You won't be able to go without it.", "She\u2019s already offered to drive, and that\u2019s a point I\u2019d need to look into it, I\u2019m pretty sure at 16 here I don\u2019t legally have to live with my parents anymore but I\u2019ll definitely have a look.", "I looked it up after you said it\u2026 \u201ccompulsive overworking\u2026 feelings of guilt\u2026\u201d few things here ringing a little close to home\u2026", "Idk where you live, but you don\u2019t legally have to live with your parents anywhere if it\u2019s an unsafe environment for you which you could make an argument that it isn\u2019t since they\u2019re leaving a teenager with 5 young children. \n\nBut in the US, depending on the state you may be considered an adult already, or you could get emancipated and live with your grandma more long term if she\u2019s okay with it.", "It will take time to get past, but you have a safe space now. Your parents may never realise what they are doing is wrong but it is. Just remember you did nothing wrong and you are not selfish.", "I just looked it up after 16 here there\u2019s no way I can be forced to go back to my parents as long as I have a safe place to go to. \nI\u2019d just need to call the program and ask if they require like guardian permission I suppose.", "Thanks you", "Did your parents sign anything when you applied? Some of these things all the permission forms come with the application (at least in the UK)"]}
