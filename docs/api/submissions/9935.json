In the interests of staying on decent terms, I pick up when my mother calls every other week, and I make small talk and answer questions to keep from starting a fight.

The trip went fine, and I didn\u2019t mention it to my mother.

You are not obligated to tell anyone what\u2019s going on in your personal life by any specific timeframe, or ever if you wish.", "NTA. When I was in my early 20s, my mother was the same way and always asked me to send her my flight info whenever I took a trip. It\u2019s a mom thing, I think. \n\nThat said, you are an adult. You don\u2019t have to check with mom before making decisions and your mother needs to remember and respect that she has raised a fully functional adult. I wouldn\u2019t be rude about it, but you can tell her that you are taking care of yourself just fine. \n\nOr, you know, send her small updates every now and then in order to keep the peace. I\u2019ve that as I grow older, my parents more and more often look to me to initiate communication or visits (as opposed to childhood, when it feels like mom and dad won\u2019t leave you alone for a second sometimes). It\u2019s a matter of making adjustments.", "NTA. Dear mom, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but if I was ok with you micromanaging my life I'd still be living at home.", "NTA. You are a financially independent adult with your own life away from your parents. Your mother does not need to be involved in your furniture buying decisions. According to her logic, you should be telling her every time you leave your house. There's an opportunity for bad things to happen anywhere you go, so her reasoning doesn't stand. \n\nShe needs to understand that you aren't a child anymore, and she isn't entitled to know every last detail about your life.", "You grew up. It happens. Your mother needs to understand that. Its not like she is calling her mom every time something happens. \n\nBut if you are feeling bad, and want to keep communication open with your mom, then sit her down and tell her exactly why you are keeping your distance. That she oversteps and tries to micromanage your life. And now that your an adult, you don't want to have to put up with it anymore. Let her know that you would be more open if she could just listen and not try to dictate what you do. That your are willing to include her more, but if continues to do so, then having low contact with her works best. Also that you may or may not take her advice on any given subject, but she has to know that it is just advice she is giving, and that when you tell her to back off a subject, she needs to. \n\nThis way she knows how much she is included is up to her and her actions. If can treat you with the respect of a grown child, then you two can have that kind of relationship. If she can't, then she is choosing to have a more distant one. \n\nNTA for living your own life.", "NTA\nIf you don't want to tell her something, you don't need to.\nYou are your own, grown up person and can handle things on your own :)", "NTA. You're an adult and are entitled to privacy and making your own decisions without your mother's input. It's understandable that you want to avoid your mother's micromanaging and potential conflict, and it's not your responsibility to constantly keep her updated on your life. However, it may be worth having a conversation with her to set boundaries and explain that you need space to live your life independently.", "NTA. Hell, I moved out of my house to divorce my ex-husband before I let my family know. It's your private business in what you wish to include them in, from gossip to shopping. That said, I do have kids. I tell them I won't judge them, but it would be cool if they let me know they're going to somewhere far away, or dating someone, just so I have a layout and digits. This is in case something happens and I can give that information to the police. I'm dead realistic.", " NTA. She is not the main character in your life you are. Keep strong and maybe stop answering all their phone calls, consequences of their own actions.", "NTA! I had a pretty good relationship with my mom when I was growing up, but by the time I hit my mid-20s, we were basically living in each other's pocket. Neither of us could do anything without the other one knowing about it. When she and my stepdad disappeared an evening a week somewhere and then later I found out they were taking dancing classes, like, for fun, **I** was hurt that she was keeping secrets. But she was an adult and she didn't owe me the information if she didn't want to tell me. And conversely, I don't owe her minute updates on my life, no matter how much she would love to know everything about me.", "NTA. Mom can focus on her own trips and computers. 25 yrs old and she wants to treat you like your 12 yrs old. If she keeps nagging you, you can reduce your calls to once a month. No need for guilt or any other feeling of not pleasing your mother.\n\nBecause, \"Who cares.\" You don't need to and don't have to. Dad is bugging you to talk to mom because he wants her off his back. In reality, he probably could careless if you spoke to her, if she would be quiet.", "Firstly NTA\n\nSecondly, i feel half the reason text messages exist is to keep the peace, by controlling in print what information you want to share.
