He has refused to leave our family home and so i had to leave with 3 kids youngest 10mo to stay with my mom. He is not happy and has told me multiple times he will not go to court or participate in the divorce proceedings. The kids and i are staying in one room but plan to take over a unit at my parents house in the next week (duplex) i obviously have to pay rent which is equivalent to our mortgage. When i was in my home B would pay the mortgage and i covered everything else (all bills, food, utilities and any other expense) which at times was a lot more than the monthly mortgage. I also pay the babysitter for our 10mo old. When we became separated and he refused to leave I left and he decided to quit his job so i guess he wouldnt have to pay any child support? I honestly dont know. I told him that since he is out of work for the foreseeable future (he is not looking) if he would watch our baby instead of having her go to the sitter, he said he would but he expected to be paid on the same schedule and amount as our babysitter, i think thats absurd and he shouldn\u2019t get a dime from me  to watch his own kid. he told me im a selfish B and an asshole for expecting him to do a job for free.

If you end up paying him for childcare I'd wonder if that could be taken as a relinquishing of parental rights. (Because parents don't \"babysit\", they parent.) Not sure if that's what you want though. Also, ask what happens if the mortgage is not getting paid, because it'd be terrible to lose that asset.
