The idea that parents have children simply so those children can provide and care for them later is wrong.", "NTA. I've had wrist surgery. No one had to wipe me.

Your mom can figure out how to do a lot of that stuff herself.", "I broke my wrist and still did everything myself despite my cast, I was even rolling sigarets after a couple days.\n\nAsking for some extra help around the house, maybe even help cooking, seems pretty fair, but her personal hygiene she should be able to manage by herself with only 1 working wrist, even if it's the non dominant hand. Muslims always wipe with their left hand, your mom can too. \n\nThere's special covers you can put on casts that make them water proof, mine was like 20 euro and I even used it to swim in the sea. Perfect for showers or baths.\n\nClothing you can compromise on, she can wear stuff that's easy to take on and off around the house, and family members can help her if she needs to wear something fancy.\n\nShe's not entitled to your help, but meeting each other half way sounds like the right thing to do, she's still your mom. But the extent of help with personal hygiene is not necessary whatsoever for that injury.", "I\u2019ve had surgery for carpal tunnel. Not the greatest for shits \u2018n\u2019 giggles, but showering and toileting were still accomplished solo.\n\nI also know of at least one person who had carpal tunnel surgery done on both arms at the same time.

It seems a little far fetched she has asked you to \u201cwipe her\u201d when she has another hand.

Your over reaction is probably way worse than the surgery and feel bad for your mom.", "NTA. I can only assume she has two hands - and can buy a bidet.

I ended up taking over the caretaker role and it destroyed my relationship with them. I was 21, working full time, and every second that wasn't work was spent bending over backwards for them. They didn't even appreciate it. I ended up accidentally walking in on them having a conversation about how I never did anything during their times of need when I held our entire family together all on my own. I promise you that if you get into that caretaker role, the same will happen. It isn't worth it, don't kill yourself over people who are just going to take it for granted.

Your mother only has one arm that is temporarily out of action due to the surgery, so she shouldn't require anyone's help to wipe her own ass, and her husband can help her shower if need be. There are people who are missing an arm entirely that can shower and wipe their asses just fine without help.

NTA.\n\nI'm a disabled woman in my 30's with two children (14m and 15f). I do not ever expect them to do anything that has to do with my care. Ever. If they want to help, great; I'm extremely grateful and appreciative of it. But to expect it of them? No way. I don't even feel comfortable asking them for help. My husband has had to become my caretaker and you know what? He says it's his responsibility, because not only is he my partner and he loves me, but he said \"in sickness and in health\" is something he takes seriously. Our kids didn't ask to be born; they didn't ask to be brought into this world. They didn't ask to be the children of a disabled mother. However, my husband signed up to care for and about me during my healthy times and disabled (I wasn't disabled when we got married, btw, but I was sick. He knew that one day it might get so bad that he'd have to take care of me and he's fine with it) and so that's *his* responsibility; not our children.\n\nI am always in awe and shocked when I hear of parents making their children take care of them because they don't want their spouse to cross over into the caretaker roll. I'm sorry, but it's okay for your child to? Even though your child didn't ask for any of this? No; that's not okay. Never.\n\nYou are NTA big time. Perhaps you ought to show your mother this thread. You are not her caretaker and unless *you* make your own unilateral decision that you *want* to be, it is incorrect and unfair to expect it of you. This is either her husband's responsibility or a professional caretaker.\n\nPlease don't let her bully you into this. You are not responsible for your mother's health or care. Yes, offering help every now and then is appreciated but it should never be expected. \n\nI'm sorry, I just cannot imagine asking my kids to do what my husband does for me. I can't imagine asking my kids to help me shower, or to help me get dressed... to administer medications and whatnot (especially suppositories). My husband does it because he loves me and he said that it's fair of me to expect it of him because he knows I'd do the same for him if the rolls were reversed.\n\nAlso, I had surgery on my hand after a bad car accident and it was immobilized in a cast for nearly two months (torn ligaments). I didn't need help wiping myself or anything else. I have one other working hand. This is like... weaponized helplessness. It's one hand. You have one other one that can wipe your own ass. It's so bizarre, hearing that people expect complete care after such a (in my opinion) minor thing. I've had 20+ surgeries, many of which were minor and many of which were major (like nephrectomy and hysterectomy and kidney reflux surgeries) and I've only ever *expected* help when my recovery completely immobilized and disabled me. After having my kidney removed, I couldn't move for months. But after my hand surgeries (I've had three)? It never even occurred to treat it even remotely similarly.\n\nSo bizarre. Good luck. And please, don't bend to her manipulations and boundary stomping.\n\nEdit: the hand I had surgeries on is my dominant one. My left one (that acts a bit... \"special\" when I try to use it) is fine. I'm not exactly the most graceful with it, but it gets the job done. Your mother has absolutely zero reason to expect this of you and absolutely no excuse to not want to do it herself.

I managed with the one hand.  For everything else, my husband would do the work.

No, of course not, but he did what he had to do.  \n\nI am going to assume your mom has two hands.

They're not hugely expensive, and will probably do wonders for her hygiene, as well.  Everyone's favorite online retailer carries quite a few models, including very cheap ones, and even some with remote controls.  (Yes, really.)

No one. Because it\u2019s completely unnecessary. The only way it would be is if OP\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have her other hand/arm and was physically incapable of doing things. She\u2019s manipulative, misogynistic, and entitled. Who the hell asks someone else to wipe their ass for them for no reason?", "She has a left hand. I\u2019d become ambidextrous before I\u2019d ask anyone to wipe my ass", "Even with that\u2026you have a whole other hand!", "\ud83d\ude02 I'm picturing a crowd of people holding plates standing behind you, yelling, \"I got it, I got it!\"  And pancakes sailing through the air.\n\nOP, NTA, why can't she use her other hand?", "Just because I changed my daughters diapers doesn\u2019t mean she has to wipe me when I have a perfectly good left arm. I don\u2019t ever want to put the burden of my care onto her, she doesn\u2019t deserve that.", "Yo, she's not TA for not wanting to do those actions. She's 19 years old, how many teens would be comfortable doing that kind of care? Not many.", "Wiping your mother because she does not want to use her non-dominant hand is not only unreasonable but extremely uncomfortable. OP is 19. She should not have to be a live-in caretaker for someone who sounds to be completely fine other than a broken wrist. If insurance wouldn\u2019t cover someone to do it because it\u2019s unnecessary I don\u2019t see why OP should have to do it. Honestly it kinda sounds like mom is giving OP a love test.\n\nAlso the baby comparison is stupid for a number of reasons but the simplest one is you choose to have a baby, OP didn\u2019t choose this situation and mom has many other options.", ">Having kids is one long poop parade it feels like.\n\nThis is entirely on the parents who choose to have kids. Just like cleaning up after a dog is a dog owner's choice when getting a dog. Parents sign up for \"poop parades\" and their kids don't owe them anything for it. Just because OPs mom decided to have a kid doesn't mean OP is obligated to wipe her mom's ass.", "I brought my daughter into this world. I owe it to her to clean her shit. She owes me, her mother, no such thing.", "And if this woman really couldn't wipe herself due to this surgery, that argument would be a better one.", "While I agree it's a little dramatic, I still think it's sad to deny help and talking about boundaries when it concerns health. Other than that, they could find a middle point, I guess. Let the mother see if she can do stuff with one arm or not and then decide how to proceed", "Right? She has a left hand, I'm assuming.", "Maybe she just doesn't know that yet and is thinking in worst-case scenarios. If you've never not had use of your wrists, and are worried about a surgery, you could easily spiral into \"omg, I'll need help wiping my butt\"", "That depends on the surgery or the level of pain you\u2019re in afterward doing certain things.  It may not be recommended but someone may need it if they can\u2019t physically do it themselves", "That was my first thought. If there is nothing wrong with her left wrist, the only thing I could see being a hassle depending on pain levels is washing her hair.", "THIS.", "This, exactly. Just because parents do parent things for their kids doesn't mean it works the other way around.\n\nOnly codependent people think that way.", "She has her husband. Does in sickness and health not mean anything any more?", "It's only one wrist, though. Presumably, she has another functional wrist that she can use to wipe her ass and do other things with. It might be difficult to write if her right hand is her dominant hand and do things that require two hands, but I'm pretty sure she can manage most self-care tasks.", "I had three pins and other various hardware holding my wrist and arm together, and I took care of myself just fine. Yes,  there's some pain,  but I personally feel this mother is just milking it for sympathy and entitlement.", "It's wrist surgery not open heart. There's no reason she can't stand in the shower with her hand bagged and outside the shower, and there's no reason she can't use her left hand to wipe her ass. Carpal tunnel doesn't put you on your death bed.", "Unless op stated somewhere else. People have 2 hands and this is one wrist.  She can wipe with the left hand.", "I'm assuming the mother has two hands here. So just because it may be her dominant hand doesn't mean she's an invalid either.", "And that can be done in the sink without anyone's ass having to come out if she does need help with it", "Bras are also a problem. but the pull-on type work. Not ideal, but better than nowt for a sizeable bust.  I know from experience,", "That's my thought there. Both arms ain't messed up, wipe with the other one. Had more than my share of injuries that made me do shit a bit differently till it healed up.", "I thought the same thing.... Does she only have one arm? (Possible, but not likely.) \n\nCan mom not purchase a toilet bidet attachment?", "Bidets are a gift to the world.", "My mom has 2 functioning arms. \nI think she had a bone fractured in her wrist. \nAfter this event, I didn't really talk with her, but if she brings anything up again, I will mention the toilet bidet. (I didn't know that these existed, so thanks for everyone in the comment section for mentioning it.)"]}
