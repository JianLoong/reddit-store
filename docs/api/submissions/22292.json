Your mother chose to have you. That does not obligate you to anything. \n\nThis will not stop here, but will only get more cumbersome as they get older. This is common in Asia and it's one of the things I disliked most when I was married to an Asian woman. The idea that parents have children simply so those children can provide and care for them later is wrong.", "NTA. I've had wrist surgery. No one had to wipe me. It would have been helpful for someone to tie the bag over my cast for a shower, but no one had to help me bathe. It's an inconvenience to have wrist surgery but it doesn't make you helpless.", "NTA tell her to use her other wrist.", "NTA. I live alone and broke my right arm (my dominant hand) and I did everything for myself. Also, I had carpal tunnel surgery on that same hand prior and managed to take care myself alone. Your mom can figure out how to do a lot of that stuff herself.", "I broke my wrist and still did everything myself despite my cast, I was even rolling sigarets after a couple days.\n\nAsking for some extra help around the house, maybe even help cooking, seems pretty fair, but her personal hygiene she should be able to manage by herself with only 1 working wrist, even if it's the non dominant hand. Muslims always wipe with their left hand, your mom can too. \n\nThere's special covers you can put on casts that make them water proof, mine was like 20 euro and I even used it to swim in the sea. Perfect for showers or baths.\n\nClothing you can compromise on, she can wear stuff that's easy to take on and off around the house, and family members can help her if she needs to wear something fancy.\n\nShe's not entitled to your help, but meeting each other half way sounds like the right thing to do, she's still your mom. But the extent of help with personal hygiene is not necessary whatsoever for that injury.", "I\u2019ve had surgery for carpal tunnel. Not the greatest for shits \u2018n\u2019 giggles, but showering and toileting were still accomplished solo.\n\nI also know of at least one person who had carpal tunnel surgery done on both arms at the same time. They managed their own hygiene. It took a bit of planning and thought, but it was doable.\n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. In your place, I\u2019d be at least dreaming of telling her to kiss my a$$ before I\u2019d consider wiping hers.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nI hope you can get out of that household soon, because you already know what they expect from you in the future.", "All I can say is \"I wish my mum was back for even 1 day, no matter what I had to do for her\".", "NTA. That's not a daughter's job. As for wiping her bum, does she have a left hand? If so, is there anything wrong with her left hand? Same for washing - she can hold a flannel or sponge with that same left hand.\n\nI think this would almost fit on r/entitledpeople.", "Nta. Tell her to buy a bidet. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. We don\u2019t need our kids to wipe our asses", "NTA. Get get baby wipes and a trash bag (so she doesn\u2019t flush them lol).", "NTA. A few years ago my mother had surgery on both her wrists. She continued to shower on her own and wipe for herself.", "NTA. My parents have each had multiple surgeries, on arms, back, and neck. Never once was I asked to wipe them. Assuming she has her left hand, she is completely capable of doing it on her own. And if she does need help, she either needs to hire a nurse or ask her husband.", "She can get a bidet installed on the toilette. She can get a temporary pole or handles in the tub to pull herself out. Home care could be asked to help where you can't.", "NTA \n\nMy mother also has the same expectation of me because I am \u201cthe girl\u201d. It is wildly unfair, and absolutely ridiculous.", "Info: did she actually ask you to wipe her ass or are you just assuming that's the case? Bc she has two hands after all and there are this things called bidet showers...", "YTA - grow up ,this is your mum , she may have asked you for a particular reason hence why not asking her husband. If the shoe was on the other foot I wonder how you would feel when your own mother turns you down in your time of need", "As long as she has two hands this is a very odd request, most people don't like the indignity of having someone else do their personal care even when it is unavoidable. NTA.", "NTA... she really cant wipe with the other hand? Its wrist surgery not open heart surgery... remember you are NEVER obligated simply because \"FaMiLy\"", "NTA, I had surgery on my right shoulder a few months ago to get a port. I wasn't able to put on a shirt myself, because I couldn\u2019t lift my arm and moving my hand also hurt a lot at least the firstfew days. Beside that, I did everything myself. And yes my right arm is my dominant arm. So doing everything with my left hand/arm wasn't funny, but it worked. \n\nI would understand if she's asking for help with part of the dressing and maybe cooking etc. But wiping her behind? Seriously? If she believes she is unable to do that herself, she should hire a professional caregiver for the time or stay at the hospital.", "NTA\n\nIt is one wrist and not both. And I would expect the husband to get the job of taking care of his injured wife, that how a marriage is supposed to work.\n\nI'd be uncomfortable as well but my mother would ever expect that of me and my siblings.", "NTA\n\nI go through phases of intense pain in BOTH of my wrists and besides help around my house - which I pay people for or kindly ask my boyfriend - I manage to do everything on my own. If it's just one wrist, she will be more than fine. If your relationship is good and healthy otherwise, I would try to figure out if this a desperate try at getting more quality time with you or to get physical affection and intimacy (would make sense if she's single and has been for a while).", "This is weird. I assume she also has a working left hand to wipe with.", "NTA. If she has problems with activities of daily living, she can work with an occupational therapist.\n\nThere are several tools that she can use (reachers, sponge on a stick, for example) that will help her as she recovers.", "My sister recently fell out of a 2 story building and broke her elbow and the top bit of her arm and fractured her collar bone.. the only thing I had to help her with was washing her hair and putting her dressing gown over her right side. Your mum is using this to make you her slave. Yes old(er)  people will struggle a bit more but jeezus having to wipe her ass because of a wrist surgery is laughable. She has another hand!", "NTA,as a mother I would cringe at the thought of my child, wiping my bottom. I\u2019d definitely use my left hand.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. My mom had carpal tunnel surgery and only had one operated on at a time so she could continue to wipe and shower. I helped with her hair and the housework. She was perfectly capable, and your mom can be too.\n\nEdit to say: if she needed extra help with showering or wiping, my dad did it for her.", "INFO: \n\nAre you an only child or do you have siblings who could help?\n\nDoes your dad work?\n\nAre you currently working or in school?", "NTA. She should hire someone to do the more intimate tasks. Family duty only extends so far and not to doing intimate tasks with an adult. Also, can't she just use her left hand?", "NTA that\u2019s a super weird ask with one hand still working", "I don\u2019t want to assume- but I\u2019m going to. She has two hands, does she not? She can wipe her own behind using her free hand. It is utterly bizarre that her expectations are that you wipe her bottom. Is it some kind of twisted power move? \n\nI don\u2019t need to use my dominant hand to wipe my behind. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\nI can see her needing help with washing her hair, which can be done fully clothed by hanging her head over the tub and using the shower head.", "NTA\n\nPretend you can\u2019t use your right hand, then go to the bathroom. You can still wipe with your left hand can\u2019t you? Of course you can and so can your mother. \n\nWhat she is suggesting is downright disgusting and I would even call it abusive. I don\u2019t know what she is thinking and how she treats you normally but this is not okay.  Do not do it.", "NTA", "She can use the opposite hand for doing everything. I just broke my arm and had to do it all with my left hand. I'm right handed. NTA", "Nta what she can't wipe with her left hand?", "INFO: Do you have other male siblings who she\u2019s not expecting to take care of her? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot missing here. If my mother needed help post-surgery, I of course would help her as her child regardless of my gender or her need. Unless your relationship is really strained and/or there is a sexist sibling dynamic at play, I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t help her.", "NTA.  She still has two hands, right?  You can also buy add on bidet toilet seats so she can power wash her ass when she's done.\n\nThere are many ways (as others have mentioned) that she can cope with her temporary situation.  \n\nWhat would she do if you weren't there?", "I had surgery on my right wrist and thumb (right is my dominant hand). I just used my left hand. I would be mortified to ask my daughter to wipe my butt.\n\nNTA.", "The wrist like one wrist? Doesn't she have a second hand?", "NTA.\n\n>as her daughter It Is expected for me to take care of her.\n\nIt is expected by her, not by you. No.", "NTA.  My husband just had shoulder surgery and I did help him get socks and shoes on etc, but we installed a bidet so that he could handle his biz alone.", "Btw. Why not the husband ?? For sick and no sickness ? If she has a husband why not ask him !?", "NTA\n\nThere aren't many kids that can take care of their parents with helping them with their personal care.. that includes wiping their arses no matter what their age.\n\nNo way I would ever do that for mine... just physically can't... and there's more backstory to that (nothing exciting).\n\nIf I was forced to... I can tell you now that it wouldn't be very pleasant for the recipient and the will be wishing that they hired someone to to their arse wiping.... and I'd be wearing 5 pairs of gloves and block out glasses so I couldn't see what I was doing!", "Jesus. I broke my arm at 61 and did everything myself\n Got pump shampoo to make it easier. Did track pants and t's so I didn't do buttons or zips. Basically didn't need an help at all and the last thing I'd ever ask my kid is to wipe my ass.\nSounds more like an excuse to be waited on all day. Let her hubby wash her and wipe  her. You help with meals making tea or whatever and keeping house clean. That's more then enough", "There are some things that you should step up and help with if living with her including cooking and cleaning and possibly tying sneaker laces etc. If she wants help bathing, tell her to put on a bathing suit and go out back and you will hose her down with the garden hose.  She can wipe her own ass. NTA", "She could start learning to use her other hand now. \n\nShe could get a bidet installed. \n\nIt\u2019s better for her to remain as independent as possible, honestly. She might need more help with putting on clothes, but toileting and washing might not be the challenge she thinks it is. \n\nShe could also be planning for food prep. \n\nNTA.", "Is your mother a fiddler crab?\n\nnta.  i pretty much do just that, but i also get paid enough to suppress the memories.  \n\n\"Am I The Asshole?\"  I know theres a joke in there somewhere, butt...", "NTA. Let hubby help", "NTA, that is beyond what you should be helping her with. Surgery on one wrist wouldn\u2019t make you need help with wiping and cleaning yourself either so this makes no sense unless she has kept herself in extremely bad health? Anyway if she needs those kinds of help she should hire someone?", "NTA. Is her other hand/wrist/arm not working? I can understand if this is her dominant hand she isn't used to using a different one...but I would be teaching myself how to do that rather than expecting my child to wipe my a$$.", "Probably yta.  It seems a little far fetched she has asked you to \u201cwipe her\u201d when she has another hand.  It\u2019s seems more likely she is a little frightened and it would be a relief to know that post surgery she will have support if she needs it.  Your over reaction is probably way worse than the surgery and feel bad for your mom.", "NTA. I can only assume she has two hands - and can buy a bidet. The idea children are there to take care of you no matter what is so gross. Fuck our own lives and boundaries, right?", "NTA. A couple of years ago I had a stroke which caused my brain to \u201ccut ties\u201d with my right hand. Meaning I haven\u2019t used it for 4 years now. \n\nI can wipe my bottom on my own and it was one of the first things they said I could do. Showering, I can do on my own with a chair. Like lots of people, sometimes we get incapacitated with broken arms, strokes/brain injuries etc, but always find a way around it. I promise, your mother can as well", "NTA\n\nShe has a husband, unless he's somehow mentally/physically disabled, I fail to see why he can't take care of his wife. This is a boundary you're not willing to cross, she cannot force you to do it.", "NTA. I'm right handed and twice in my life I've lost the ability to use my right hand, once when I was 13 major laceration to my right elbow and broke my right hand when I was 18. I did literally everything on my own. You have to learn to become a lefty for a couple months but it comes naturally pretty quick. The only thing that was hard was typing and writing. Most everything else can be done with one hand.", "Her request is bizarre.\n\nIt is reasonable that she may need help with dressing during the recovery period. Buttons, zips, etc. are tricky to do up one-handed. (Although, here's a tip: pull-on tops and elastic-waisted pants are your friend.)\n\nBut wiping one's ass is not an action that requires two hands.\n\nShe will still have one functional hand. Tell her to use it.", "There are many people who do not wish to do bodily care activities for parents. In that sense, NTA.\n\nYou have already suggested to hire helpers, which is something your mom could reconsider.\n\nYour Dad or other siblings could help if they are willing.\n\nTypically, everyone in the family can take turns, which may include you, so you don't have to do altogether.", "OMG yes....wtf", "I did tell her to do that, but she got slightly offended", "You're lucky, not all of us are so fortunate to have had such a good relationship with our mother.\n\nMine is still alive and I don't want to see her ever.", "I've both hurt my wrist a few times and had one c-section, but I could still wipe myself and wash up too. It sounds wild to me to ask your 19 year old to do those things for you when you have the other hand still? \n\nI agree with shirts. Perhaps when cooking a helping hand would be a good idea. But the other part is a wild request.", "Not supporting the mom but have you ever tried to wipe with your non dominant hand? It feels soooo weird and wrong and never clean enough (not that I think having another person wipe me is a better alternative tho). I guess there really is no win here \ud83d\ude02", "Right, when I was a kid I broke both my wrists at different times and I just used the other hand to wipe and brush my teeth. This is really bizarre!", "If she doesn't want to, she shouldn't have to. This is nothing less than disgusting, *entitled* behaviour from her mother! She's her daughter FFS - NOT her carer. I would do this for my mom (and dad) in a heartbeat, but that is MY personal choice. Everyone is different, and everyone has the right to choose. The mother is the AH here.", "As would any normal person...", "Ditto.\n\nBroke my wrist this year. Wiped my own ass, tyvm. Bought a silicone cover for my cast, showered solo. Wore leggings and t shirts or tank tops (no buttons or zippers). Made my own food, washed my own dishes. Survived. Mom isn't helpless. She can handle most stuff with minor accommodations.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely agree! I'd start using my non dominant hand for everything the moment i found out. OP don't help in any way you're uncomfortable with", "Her dominant hand is the right one. She's just not used to do anything with her left hand.", "She literally told me to help her wipe and shower... \nIt's not like I can enter her mind and know exactly what she meant by telling me that.\nI don't mind helping her get dressed or cooking food, which I already do.", "Then let her be offended. Your position is reasonable, and you are not responsible for her feelings.", "Bidet!", "Bidet!!", "Took care of myself after a total hip replacement.  Wrist would be easy.", "My dominant hand is currently broken. Learning to do things with my other has been difficult, but not impossible.", "She gonna learn today!", "Then she's about to get used to it, isn't she.", "Excellent time for her to start learning!", "Guess she better start practicing. NTA", "Welp there is no time like the present for her to learn.", "Then, nta.  That\u2019s a crazy over reach on your mom", "If it's the action your against them Yta. I am surprised more parents on here aren't sounding off. Having kids is one long poop parade it feels like. It's is a natural part of life  it drives me nuts to see dog owners not pick up after their loved animal since they fight the gross factor of picking it up or carrying it for extended period. I hope that was understandable I have a reading writing disability for lack of better term. NTA if it's your relationship that's the key factor. If she becomes unbearable or unbalanced under stress or pain or if your relationship isn't a close one and she is using this as emotional blackmail to force it if that makes sense?"]}
