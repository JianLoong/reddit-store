Muslims always wipe with their left hand, your mom can too. \n\nThere's special covers you can put on casts that make them water proof, mine was like 20 euro and I even used it to swim in the sea. Perfect for showers or baths.\n\nClothing you can compromise on, she can wear stuff that's easy to take on and off around the house, and family members can help her if she needs to wear something fancy.\n\nShe's not entitled to your help, but meeting each other half way sounds like the right thing to do, she's still your mom.

I promise you that if you get into that caretaker role, the same will happen. It isn't worth it, don't kill yourself over people who are just going to take it for granted.

NTA.\n\nI'm a disabled woman in my 30's with two children (14m and 15f). I do not ever expect them to do anything that has to do with my care. Ever. If they want to help, great; I'm extremely grateful and appreciative of it. But to expect it of them? No way. I don't even feel comfortable asking them for help. My husband has had to become my caretaker and you know what? He says it's his responsibility, because not only is he my partner and he loves me, but he said \"in sickness and in health\" is something he takes seriously. Our kids didn't ask to be born; they didn't ask to be brought into this world. They didn't ask to be the children of a disabled mother. However, my husband signed up to care for and about me during my healthy times and disabled (I wasn't disabled when we got married, btw, but I was sick. He knew that one day it might get so bad that he'd have to take care of me and he's fine with it) and so that's *his* responsibility; not our children.\n\nI am always in awe and shocked when I hear of parents making their children take care of them because they don't want their spouse to cross over into the caretaker roll. I'm sorry, but it's okay for your child to? Even though your child didn't ask for any of this? No; that's not okay. Never.\n\nYou are NTA big time. Perhaps you ought to show your mother this thread. You are not her caretaker and unless *you* make your own unilateral decision that you *want* to be, it is incorrect and unfair to expect it of you. This is either her husband's responsibility or a professional caretaker.\n\nPlease don't let her bully you into this. You are not responsible for your mother's health or care. Yes, offering help every now and then is appreciated but it should never be expected. \n\nI'm sorry, I just cannot imagine asking my kids to do what my husband does for me. I can't imagine asking my kids to help me shower, or to help me get dressed... to administer medications and whatnot (especially suppositories). My husband does it because he loves me and he said that it's fair of me to expect it of him because he knows I'd do the same for him if the rolls were reversed.\n\nAlso, I had surgery on my hand after a bad car accident and it was immobilized in a cast for nearly two months (torn ligaments). I didn't need help wiping myself or anything else. I have one other working hand. This is like... weaponized helplessness. It's one hand. You have one other one that can wipe your own ass. It's so bizarre, hearing that people expect complete care after such a (in my opinion) minor thing. I've had 20+ surgeries, many of which were minor and many of which were major (like nephrectomy and hysterectomy and kidney reflux surgeries) and I've only ever *expected* help when my recovery completely immobilized and disabled me. After having my kidney removed, I couldn't move for months. But after my hand surgeries (I've had three)? It never even occurred to treat it even remotely similarly.\n\nSo bizarre. Good luck. And please, don't bend to her manipulations and boundary stomping.\n\nEdit: the hand I had surgeries on is my dominant one. My left one (that acts a bit... \"special\" when I try to use it) is fine. I'm not exactly the most graceful with it, but it gets the job done. Your mother has absolutely zero reason to expect this of you and absolutely no excuse to not want to do it herself. Seriously, I'm just baffled by her expectations.", "NTA I broke both my hands last year, going over the handlebars of my mountain bike.

I managed with the one hand.  For everything else, my husband would do the work.  If chores needed to be done, he did those things either before he left for work, when he got home from work, or on the weekend.  Yes, this included cooking.  Was it easy on him?  No, of course not, but he did what he had to do.  \n\nI am going to assume your mom has two hands.  If she cannot use the other hand for whatever reason, suggest she get a bidet that fits over her existing toilet.  They're not hugely expensive, and will probably do wonders for her hygiene, as well.  Everyone's favorite online retailer carries quite a few models, including very cheap ones, and even some with remote controls.  (Yes, really.)  For everything else, the doctor is going to tell her to wrap the affected appendage in a plastic bag, as she would still be able to shower/bathe herself.  \n\nWomen are not caregivers by nature, that is a learned behavior that we are taught, through many ways, as we grow up.

I hope everything works out well for you! \n\nHopefully, they\u2019ll keep your mom in the hospital for long enough that the nurses and other staff (PT, etc) will have already taught her how to handle things for herself. \n\nAnd if it does come up again, maybe go to a pre-op appointment with her and ask the doctor or surgeon about home care? That way no one can accuse you of not caring or not trying or anything like that. You\u2019re allowed to care while not wanting to bathe and wipe your mother\u2014 they\u2019re not mutually exclusive.", "Around 10 years ago my mother got some serious complications after a routine surgery, she was in a ton of pain and pretty much bed ridden, has a to stay in the hospital for 3-4 months straight and even tho she COULD move her hands she couldn't stand up or phisically go to the toilet... I did stayed with her at the hospital several days and night and did wiped and bathe her several times, I believe it's up to each person, she wiped my arse for YEARS as a baby, I saw it as my turn to return the favor", "NTA. Do NOT cave, or you\u2019ll set a precedent that will follow you into elder care hell.\n\nI just. Dang. Jesus, lady, buy a fuckin\u2019 bidet.", "Had rotator cuff repair last November. Never once had my son wipe my ass or bathe me. He only helped get my shirt changed the first few days after and we worked it out where he didn\u2019t have to see my breasts. \n\nSounds like an excuse to be waited on. Have your mom look at EquipMeOT on YouTube. She has many videos on how to do things after surgery. By. Yourself.\n\nNTA for not wanting to help wipe your mom\u2019s butt!", "I think your mom is over estimating what her post op needs will be. I\u2019ve had shoulder surgeries and could still shower and dress and wipe myself. Only think I could do was put my hair up. It might be awkward for her to wipe lefty. But she can figure it out. My mom has also had several surgeries and needed my help post op. Never have I had to wipe her. Dress her yes, but never wipe her.", "It's just her right wrist?  How ridiculous.  NTA", "I would probably try to wipe my own ass with my elbow rather than expect someone else to do it.\n\nAnd yes - a bidet regardless of surgery.", "I don't get the whole \"daughter\" obligation. Is that a religious thing? Is your family super traditional? Because to me it seems like the guy who made a baby with her can get her dressed, I see more obligation in marriage than in daughterhood.", "You are an absolute asshole. Its your mother and you take care of her like everyone with a sick mother would. Thats what it meant to nurse someone.", "What the fuck. NTA. However, your mom is. It honestly just sounds like she is using her wrist injury as an excuse to be treated like royalty. You\u2019re not obligated to do anything like that.", "LOL at \"power wash her ass\"", "(gasp) her HUSBAND would have to step up and take care of his own wife. Good grief, how can the two of them be married and not automatically turn to each other rather than a child for intimate care help?", "This is honestly making me feel super creeps from mum", "[deleted]", "i would offer to help my mom in every way besides wiping her bottom. that\u2019s just nasty.", "she cleaned her ass when she was a baby who wants to wipe grown women shit?", "oh no! the mother did what you're supposed to do when you're an adult and have a child! op doesn't owe her mother that for doing what you're supposed to do for a child.", "yikes, seek help", "i still think op is right but her mum did wipe her ops ass and did so much shit for her as a newborn i dont think the request is that outlandish if the mum had broke both her hands", "She wiped your ass. I won't dump my parents in nursing homes for strangers to care for them. \nIt's the circle of life.", "Great clueless and unaware answer. Sounds like you\u2019ve been fortunate enough to not have to care for a parent or someone in need. You lucky.", "She owes nothing. But one day the roles switch. You won\u2019t understand until it\u2019s you and yours.", "So what, nothing matters anymore at all because people can lie?", "Same :). Well, I had help with shoes, the first days.", "I disagree that she is misogynistic. It\u2019s entirely possible that she is just more comfortable with another female helping her with these things.", "He can't touch his wife's butthole, don't you know touching butholes is gay? XD\n\nSeriously, why the fuck would you ask your kid when you got a wholeass man and another hand?", "well... ops mother isn't helpless. let's hope she grows into a parent that doesn't act like a helpless spoiled child :).", "That's the point - she's having wrist surgery. She has a fully functioning other arm-  she doesn't need her ass wiped. NTA", "What did she do when she saw you come back in? I'm sorry your mum did this to you. My mum died of pancreatic cancer and I was her carer for 14 months. She had tumours on her spine removed at one point and I had to help her to the toilet and shower. She had so many accidents and would cry as I cleaned her up. She would wipe herself on good days and on bad days I would. She wanted her dignity in death and having to ask me to clean her was such a sensitive and hard thing for her to do. I can't believe your mum would do that to you.", "Wow...what a manipulative a*hole you had as a mother.\n\nAlso, I don't get the part of she wanting you to dump your life and go with her when the most practical answer to that would have been taking her to your house to keep an eye on her. Like I undestand you not wanting them there 24/7 but it kinda sound like she was the one not willing to let her life behind to make her own care a little easier for her family", "She certainly is not helpless. They need speak to each other and figure it out. But running away from a scary thing will only mess the kid for the future. The mother sounds like she\u2019s having simple surgery and is also panicked. But avoidance doesn\u2019t work.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the thing! It\u2019s not us saying she *has* to take care of herself even though she\u2019s in serious need, it\u2019s us saying she\u2019s *not* in serious need with one good arm and a totally able spouse. Not the same.", "Yes it is. If you\u2019re not comfortable with your spouse doing exactly what they promised in your marriage vows, then figure out why that is and don\u2019t put your full (completely unnecessary) physical care on your teenager. And it also says specifically that it\u2019s because she\u2019s the daughter. Dad sucks too", "Handouts arent bad. Less debt for everyone is good, what are you on about?", "Might be a good excuse to buy her a bidet, anyways. There's plenty of models that mount to the toilet, and then just switch on. Make sure it's left handed, though.", "THAT is Socialist thinking, I am responsible for me & mine. I should not have to bail out you and other irresponsible spenders for your mistakes.", "Idk\u2026 There was a guy here on Reddit about ten years ago who broke his arm(s?) at 14. His momma thought he needed help lmao", "Same, when I was 15. Broke one wrist and sprained the other due to a fall. Was still able to wipe my own ass with the hand that was only sprained (the first week really sucked but after that it was ok).", "I appreciate your thoughts! Even though I will always have cancer, it's just the nature of my current beast, but I'm doing really well now!", "If youre in america you already are. Suck it buttercup. Im disabled and survive on govt programs paid for by taxes. Guess i should die huh (btw i have a degree and no collehe debt)", "Dear Pansy - You are correct but I do not have to agree with it. Good for you with no college debt - but no one I know agrees with our tax dollars paying off $10k in college debt for each applicant. Seriously though, that truly sucks to be disabled. Take care.", "THIS right here! I had surgery on both hands at once a couple of years ago. My sister came to stay with me to drive me from the surgery and then my dad came for the rest of my recovery. No way in hell was I asking them to wipe my ass. I installed 2 bidets (brondell had amazing ones) and never once did they have to help me, lol. My dad DID help me with cooking bc I couldn't chop things for several weeks or lift anything over 5 lbs. Then my oldest was home after a few days and took over cooking. I just went bra-less and wore loose clothing, so no one even had to help me dress. I DID ask for help from family during recovery, but I kept it reasonable and it was an *ask* not an *expectation* or demand.", "I had the same surgery.  I didn\u2019t have any expectations for my wife or children.  Yes some actions hurt but there was no way I was having any of them help me in the bathroom,", "Yes, you can hire someone for butt wiping. Find a home health nurse.", "She can hire someone to help her. Or... Just maybe... She can use the other hand for a while lol", "It's totally normal for a family member who is taking care of an elderly parent to do this if the parent is literally incapable of it. It's not normal when the parent has a perfectly functioning arm left and is not so enfeebled that she can't reach back there. I'm twice OP's age and my own parents are nowhere near the point where they need me to wipe their butts for them. OP is NTA and her mom is asking way too much for far too little of a reason. Also, if her mom were at that point, her husband SHOULD be the first person to go to for this.", "Ditto word for word on the first paragraph. Mums be slippin on that ice and shattering their wrists.", "NTA. Your Mom can wipe her own ass and wash herself. I get the feeling she\u2019s trying to find out how much care you\u2019re willing to provide in the future. Please do the bare minimum", "Same w my fianc\u00e9. Only extra thing I had to do was take him for the surgery and drive him home after because he wasn\u2019t allowed to drive himself due to the anesthetic.", "Kind of her fault that she wiped that person's ass though... I think that's the key difference. You don't owe your parents anything. Period", "a baby and a grown ass woman is different. babies can\u2019t do it, OP mom is more than capable of wiping her ass with her other hand & she has a husband who vowed to take care of her!", "How is it misogynistic wanting someone of the same gender to wipe your genitals? I\u2019m not sure if I missed a reply or if I\u2019m just clueless.\n\nThe mom is being absolutely ridiculous with her request. I\u2019ve had my entire left arm in a cast and needed 2 years of PT to have most of my range of motion in my shoulder, however at no point did I need help wiping my ass. \n\nIf my father needed it, I\u2019d get not wanting my mother doing it. We\u2019d both fucking hate it, but it\u2019d save him some self respect in his marriage.", "I fully agree, not all old people need to be cared in the way they imply unless they have a health issue or actual permanent disability that needs it.\n\nMy 80+ great aunt needed supervision and company, but she was able to bath herself, get up and down a set of stairs and even help with cooking until she died. My 86yo maternal grandpa still liked to work around his house and ended up lifting a half wall and fixing the house's sidewalk a week before dying.\n\nOn contrast to them, my paternal grandma needed of an aid after her parkinson got worse, and still with that, she wasn't bedbound and could fed herself.", "Exactly. My mother wanted me to take care of her on that level. I was not comfortable doing so. I never felt close to her or was comforted by her when I was younger and sick. She would not have done it for me even though she was a nurse. She only did when I was a baby and she was forced to do it. When I told her I\u2019m not wiping her butt, my mother was spiteful and told me it was because I was never a mother so I would never understand.", "That's completely different from demanding it. I got stuck with the responsibility of caring for my mom since I was 12 (now almost 26). Every decision I make (like looking at houses and apartments) revolves around her and the accessibility/location. I feel trapped, and unable to choose to live my life the way I want to. I almost married a guy from England just so I'd have an excuse to leave. \n\nNow that I'm getting therapy and attend a codependency support group, I'm putting in boundaries. Her physical disabilities are used as an excuse for me to do the cleaning, run errands, provide financial support, and anything else she decides on. I told her that between work and college, I would not have time to pick up her pills from CVS, and I got silent treatment from her for a week, until she needed my help with our cat having medical issues. That was the best week of my life because she wasn't constantly calling me to ask me to do things for her. \n\nI am not capable of providing the care/help she needs without sacrificing my future. If that is selfish, so be it. But children are not solely responsible for caring for their parents as they age. If they want to, and can, then great. But we need to stop shaming children who can't or won't do that. They are a separate human with separate needs and a separate life that should not revolve around an aging or ailing parent.", "Good to now I'm not just really inept!  And I hate to think what could happen while trying to change a wiggly toddler one-handed. Having had a wiggly toddler myself.", "I remember a few years ago my MIL cooked a very nice Thanksgiving dinner for 12 or 13 people, kind of spur of the moment. ( thanksgiving isn\u2019t as big a deal here in Canada.)\n\nShe didn\u2019t need any of us young whippersnappers ( 50s and 60s ) helping her. She was I think 85 at the time and she had a friend help her. Her friend was 94.\n\nThe dinner was great.", "This. I had surgery on my right shoulder, had to keep it as immobile as possible. Started practicing using my left hand weeks in advance. Same for eating.", "Sounds like she is looking forward to this opportunity to manipulate her daughter into doing her bidding.", "Both of mine were more than local too, and, in fact, I wound up going a day without pain meds due to a prescription date mess the second time, which was\u2026.not great, but not unbearable since they\u2019d numbed it pretty well in the OR. I was definitely fine to do all but write or use silverware  when my dominant hand was done, though!", "All I remember about my mom\u2019s ct surgery was that I had to write the cheques for her at the grocery store(yeah, loooooong time ago lol)", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I'm currently doing well and the cancer is stable.", "I had a full body arthritis flare a couple years ago and never asked my partner to help me wipe. I had to twist weird, and maybe asked him to help me stand up or sit down but never to finish"]}
