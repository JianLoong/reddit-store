I think those kids should all learn to mind their own business.\n\nI'm 40F and I have a son Jake 11M who has ADHD. He has treatment for this. We don't live in the US, ADA doesn't apply alas.\n\nOne of Jake's current issues is that he has frequent meltdowns at school because of his poor emotional regulation. This escalated when he changed schools last summer when we moved. We are working on this issue with the school and his doctor and therapists. There has been progress but it's still an issue.\n\nWhen he's overwhelmed and has a meltdown, he ends up screaming and / or needing to leave the room, occasionally throwing a book on the floor or something similar. Outside of those events he is a mild-spoken, polite kid who tries to be nice to everyone. Things that are upsetting but manageable to others can send him in a spiral. He doesn't have a good relationship with his peers because of that.\n\nThe class as a group discusses on a regular basis with their head teacher what to change for a better learning environment. My son is a regular topic of discussion. Apparently he has had outbursts because when he's visibly upset and cranky, the other students come up to him and ask him what is the matter with him, and after being asked by x different people he eventually melts down and yells at everyone to leave him alone. It\u2019s really hard for him to calm down after a meltdown and obviously it also disrupts the class including the people who didn\u2019t bother him.\n\nTheir solution to that is that there is a designated student each week that has the job of asking my son why he's upset and telling the answer to the others. My son thinks it's great because that means he won't be bothered by 10 different people until he's in crisis mode every time he has a bad day.\n\nI'm appalled, however, that the teachers can't tell the other students to just mind their own business. None of those kids are my son's friends, they politely tolerate him at best, and they shouldn't have an entire process to satisfy their curiosity about the reasons of my kid's emotional state. I think he's probably become the subject of a lot of classroom gossip because of his symptoms.\n\nMy husband says our son seems to be happy with this, that whatever works is fine, and I shouldn't interfere. I think Jake is happy to go from a really crappy situation to a somewhat less crappy one but he shouldn't have to put up with either. School is hard enough for him.\n\nSo WIBTA to tell the teachers this is ridiculous and they should tell their students to just not bother my kid when he's visibly upset.\n\nEdit: Everyone is saying it's fine because my son is okay with it but Jake was bullied a lot in the past and is still very rejected and isolated. He craves approval and would jump into a swamp for anyone who is kind to him for 5 straight minutes. That's why I still worry that even though he says he is okay with it, he just thinks he has to do this to make everybody not hate him.\n\nThe \"intervention\" of asking what annoys him does not occur when my son has a meltdown and disturbs the class, but when he looks upset and is still quiet and controlled. Once he has a meltdown he can't have conversations anymore. When that happens he leaves the classroom so he can calm down without further interrupting the class.", "created_utc": 1680261298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127htli/wibta_if_i_tell_the_school_im_not_ok_with_having/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He says that he is happy that only 1 person will ask him what is wrong and that can help him calm down sooner. While I understand you want them to mind their own business, that is difficult for them to do with 1 student having an outburst and then needing to take the time away from class to assist them.\n\nIn the end, let your son make the choice.", "I\u2019m also going with a light YTA. I agree they should mind their own business but they\u2019re kids. You have to look at it from their POV too. Your child unfortunately is having meltdowns, of course they\u2019re going to want to know why. Jake seems happy that this is going to be the new system so why not let him decide and if it doesn\u2019t work that can be addressed at a later time. If he decides he doesn\u2019t like that people want to know, he may not be suited to a mainstream school full of people who don\u2019t have meltdowns and are concerned/curious. People all throughout his life are going to be concerned when they see him having a meltdown, it\u2019s human nature. I think this is a great system which uses balance. They get to make sure he\u2019s ok, and Jake doesn\u2019t have to deal with 100 questions. They could even try to tell the children why it\u2019s happening and ask that they leave him alone completely which is another good option. You could suggest this rather than jumping the gun and suggesting the school are taking the mic. It\u2019s possible but it\u2019s also possible they\u2019re trying to take a balanced approach. But I just hope this doesn\u2019t turn into bullying. Personally, I\u2019ve never known bullies to check in on a victim. They\u2019re probably confused why it\u2019s happening and there needs to be more communication.", "Because your son himself thinks this is a good idea, and so does the teacher, and because the students are cooperatively working to help him and their class as a whole, yes, YTA here.", "YTA The teachers came up with an innovative solution that keeps your son from having a meltdown that he finds acceptable. This could even be a way for him to  improve his relationship with other students since he has a chance to talk with them one on one. \n\nOf course your son is the subject of gossip right now. He regularly disrupts the class and interferes with other students' learning. You are naive to think the students will not be curious and likely annoyed by this. \n\nIf your child has this severe of a problem, you should be happy the teachers found a way to keep him in a mainstream classroom.", "Soft YTA. I get wanting to protect your son, but he seems on board with this solution. Not only that, but it will also avoid one of his triggers. Why not give it a try and see if it works? If it does, great!

They have their learning interrupted.  They\u2019d have special procedures to follow when you son has a meltdown.  They are just kids trying to make sense of the world too, and trying to understand what it happening.  Sounds like they are trying to engage with your son, and some of them at least care enough to ask what is upsetting him.\n\nIt sounds like all the kids have figured out a process together that - most importantly -  your son is happy with.  Isn\u2019t that a good thing?\n\nYTA", "YTA. It is their business because it disrupts the class. Why not try working with them to help find a solution. If your son is happy with this why rock the boat?", "YTA. I do agree that those children should mind their own business, but what should matter most to you is what your kid feels. There\u2019s no guarantee that telling kids to mind their own business will work, and if this system works for your child then just go with it for his sake. If he changes his mind later and decides it doesn\u2019t work for him anymore then you can address the situation at that time.", "Also a soft YTA. Not only because you are not hearing what your son is saying but also because you are not trying to be constructive. when i hear that multiple kids ask your son what is wrong, I interpret this as a kind gesture by the kids in the class. They had also, as a class, observed that this is upsetting to your son and want to amend it. these are all messages that they care for your son, even if they are not close. Maybe, if you look at it in this light, you would be able to suggest a different question for the designated person to ask or ask your son what ideally he would like the class to do. i realize this is a difficult situation for you and your son, and i don't know all the details. \n\nhope everything continues improving.", "Your son is happy with this idea which is really all that matters.

If he has an individual education plan it should be addressed there with input from doctors and therapists.\n\n  I was an undiagnosed autistic kid in school in the 1960s. I remember very little from elementary school because my reaction was to turtle, to withdraw and forget.  There was serious trauma daily, but to those adults in my life, I was an odd kid, struggling but doing okay.  I was not anything close to okay. \n\nI was terrified every day, but that was just life. I didn't know it could be different. I learned that telling adults just made it worse, so, like most kids like me, I learned to act normal for defined periods of time.\n\nThis is to say, don't trust an autistic kid who says he's  fine.  When I got home from school I was fine. Sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of milk and some warm brownies, I was fine. And I was safe!  The last thing I wanted to do was to talk about the horror of school.  It was easier to say I'm fine.\n\nI wish his school had a quiet place for him to shake down in ptivate, or, better yet, with a puppy.  An emotional support animal might make a difference.", "As a kid who was too \u201cemotionally unstable\u201d because of adhd in school, Yta. Whatever works, works. Our brains love the attention and others understanding our mindset is very good. Having a chance to explain what\u2019s going on to people around him will help him figure out how to deal with it. I was just bullied, excommunicated, or alone because people were \u201cminding their own business \u201c and wanted nothing to do with me. This sounds like a wonderful cooperative way to talk about feelings and make everyone more comfortable.", "YTA. I understand the impulse to go mama bear mode in this situation, but your son likes the set up. His classmates are banding together to figure out a system that helps him. They recognized that having so many of them ask at once was overwhelming, and came up with a strategy to help. I wouldn't say this sounds like kids who barely tolerate him. \n\nDeep breaths, mama.", "I'm going to go with a very soft ywbta. How well do you know your son's teacher? What you've described it sounds like the students in your son's class are trying to help, they're expressing concern they want to know what's wrong it sounds like they're trying to be good people and that should be encouraged. And if they have found a working solution to try to help your son great. However given your comments about your son being bullied in the past in this potentially being a people-pleasing action on his part, you probably would not be in the wrong to express your reservations to the teacher in a form of \"I'm not sure this is the best idea, I'm not going to make a problem about it, but I would like you to keep an eye on things and make sure that this isn't devolving into a bad situation.\"\n\nOn mobile, excuse punctuation and grammar issues please", "Can\u2019t a teacher ask?\n\nSad to say it sounds like they already are gossiping about him in this current setting if that\u2019s what your worried about.  \n\nAnd if your son is okay with it\u2026isn\u2019t it okay?\n\nEdit: just to add I\u2019m leaning towards being on your side here, the teacher should stop bullying in have kids repeatedly ask.", "NTA\n\nTrying to imagine being cranky at work and all of my colleagues who I'm not close to feeling entitled to know why exactly. It's weird.", "Uff teachers ... \n\nWell I had my share of situations where I really thought why did this person think it's a good that he/she is a teacher. \n\nFor the moment I am with your husband though, that if your kid is OK you really should leave it at that. \n\nBut then you know your kid and maybe it's really like the lesser of two evils. In this case your kid might be OKish with it while in reality he is not or at least not really. \n\nI too think that people should learn that you do not have a right to know why someone is upset. And also kids must learn that. But the kids maybe come from a place where they think if they just knew what upsets your son they actually can improve the situation and make things better for him. Maybe they even discussed this and that's why it is OK for him. \n\nWhatever the situation is I'd try to be diplomatic still. Because right now while you do not understand why the teacher thought that this would be a good solution I cannot clearly identify if or if not the teacher did something wrong. It's still simple unclear. \n\nMaybe you start asking your son how they came up with this solution and if he feels really comfortable with this. If he really prefers to just be left alone I'd contact the teacher and have a talk on how this solution is not working for your son and they just have to leave him alone.", "YTA. If he is happy with this idea, nothing else matter.", "NTA - 100% get your point here about it being a slightly less crappy situation. \nThe school should definitely be coming up with better alternative ways to handle this.", "After reading some comments you made I think nta.  I think k ur son is thinking if my only options is 1 person or the whole class asking what's wrong then he would choose the lesser.  But would prefer to be left alone.

Everything possible is done to minimize the impact on the other students and the only thing asked of them is that they not unnecessarily needle him.

He couldn't think of the answer and the other kids got impatient (because the exercise required to pass the paper along to the next kid).

I do think that the teacher is doing something clever here - if one student is assigned to talk to him and then communicate his needs to the others, that puts them in the position of advocating for him instead of writing him off as weird. If that role gets passed from student to student, they will all learn how to communicate with him and probably develop some much needed empathy. It isn\u2019t really FAIR that your son has to be the one to help them learn empathy, but a lot of the time that\u2019s something that is disproportionately put on kids with disabilities, and he will be in the classroom with them anyway so having them learn could be a net positive for him.

This sounds like they approach him before he\u2019s disruptive/has a meltdown. Is he just being quiet/shut off?", "YTA. I have ADHD. I get having those meltdowns. I understood that my actions are my responsibility even if they come from a mental health place. If your son has issues with interacting with a group of people then it might be best to home school him and use after school activities to help him learn to control his emotions and socialize.", "I'm going to say NAH. \nYour school is trying to problem-solve and your son likes the idea. \n\nBut gossip can set a kid up for ruin. (And seriously,  why are kids doing this if they aren't trying to be friends?)\n\nI think it's better to offer a different solution, such as maybe a teacher asks him, or a student alerts a teacher that your son looks upset- the kids deserve to have their classes not be interrupted, so please try to approach this with a problem-solving attitude, otherwise you'll have a harder time with limiting solutions next time they come up with something.", "I don't think is ADHD, for what it's worth. are you sure there's not something else going on? autism?", "YTA \nI understand it comes from a place of love and concern but none the less YTA. You need to realize your son\u2019s outburst are traumatizing the other children. The class worked together to find a way to improve the environment for themselves but also a solution that helps your son. If he\u2019s already triggered and in a survival state having less stimuli will make it easier to pull himself back. This also allows the other students to understand what triggered him. They want to understand because they don\u2019t want it to happen. So don\u2019t say you do t understand why they need to know. They\u2019re in constant fear of his meltdowns and want to do their best to make it not happen. Stop and chew on that.\n\n\nETA \u201cnot\u201d in second to last sentence", "YTA.  Other students are showing concern for your son and working together to find a way to help him with bud issues. Their method allows them to 1) have one contact, so repeated questions won\u2019t further irritate your son; 2) lets them know what set him off do maybe they can mitigate the issue in the future or be prepared for a potential outburst (your son\u2019s outbursts effect more than just your son and if other students are sensitive to things being thrown or other aggression be it physical or verbal, they deserve any warning they can get): 3) expecting kids to mind their own business when their world gets torn apart by your son\u2019s behavior is unrealistic and they have every right to get information that might help them manage the situation in the future for their own safety; 4) this is a method that the person who has an issue, your son, agrees would help him.  Your son isn\u2019t the only victim at school.  Every kid that has class disrupted and is afraid of things being throw is a victim.  Climb outside your box and realize the rest of them are suffering too.", "Soft YTA - I truly feel for you, as a mother. You're protective of him and don't want him to be disrespected or intentionally \"othered\" even if he isn't fully aware of what's happening.\n\nHowever, we as parents have the job of preparing our children for the world and allowing them to be uncomfortable at times. This isn't about his ADHD and how you're managing that. It's about his interactions with classmates. They could have good intentions or they could just be looking to gossip. It's probably a mixture of both and you can't control that.\n\nFor those other kids and your son, learning to be in the same room and have positive interactions is imperative. This is why we changed the former system of segregated special education to integration. It's a learning experience for all.", "OP- what is your ideal solution to this scenario? Do you want the kids to ignore him screaming and not respond at all? Do you want the teacher to stop class and intervene by removing your son? Do you want the teacher to ignore your son while his classmates watch? What is your ideal handling of the situation?", "I was looking for comments like this. The way I understand it is that kids are coming up to ask him what's wrong if he is looking slightly annoyed? And OP talked to her son and he said in most cases when he looks annoyed he just wants to be left alone.\n\nSo why not just tell the class to leave him alone? Why does anyone have to ask at all? And if someone wants to check in, then it should be the teacher... \n\nI do however agree that if interruptions and meltdowns still happen fairly regularly when he is left alone that he may require more specialised learning/environment as it would be unfair to the rest of the kids.", "At 11 years old the other students should also be able to leave the kid alone and not bully him to cause meltdowns.", "NTA at all, maybe you should edit your post to make it clear that he himself has said that he wants to be left alone and is only accepting the proposed arrangement because he doesn't think being left alone is a realistic expectation (which it should be!).\n\nIn my completely unqualified opinion (I have no kids, am not a teacher, but I am autistic and had similar annoyances at school) I would suggest that the teacher speaks to the whole class about ways to show someone you care when they seem to be upset (invite them to join your game or sit with you at lunch, perhaps ask if they would like a hug) and also remind them that some people prefer to be given space when they're processing feelings. I would also recommend coming up with a simple **hand signal** that means \"I don't feel like talking at the moment\" - again, not singling out your son, but for anyone in the class to use - and make sure all the kids know that if they ask someone a question and they reply with that hand signal then they should respect that and leave them alone. (This is something that I would have found really helpful because for me it was always so hard to actually make words come out of my mouth when I was having a hard time.)", "Speaking as someone who, at 31, HATES being asked \"whats wrong?\" or \"are you okay?\" when I'm upset, YWBTA. Your 'solution' comes off as \"ignore it and it will go away\", which it wont. He might be able to cope better as he gets older, but having everyone ignore him will make him feel more isolated.\n\nAt the same time, it can be overwhelming to have so many people asking over and over again if you're okay, when you're not and you're just trying to manage and calm down.\n\nHaving one person ask him and relay that to others will help, it won't make him feel isolated and like no once cares (as being completely ignored would), but won't overwhelm him with 12+ people asking him over and over again if he's okay.\n\nYour son is okay with this idea, instead of shutting it down, talk to him and find a way of letting him know that if this system doesn't work for him, it is okay to stop using it and try to find a different method of management", "Asking what is wrong is not demanding. Jake seems okay with it and if anything, if he is upset, he should only be asked \u201care you okay/what\u2019s wrong\u201d and \u201cdo you want to be left alone?\u201d So he doesn\u2019t feel pressured to answer if doesn\u2019t feel comfortable to and it can be relayed to the class to give him space/leave him alone.", "I wonder if the plan could be modified to the one student asking your son \"Do you want to tell me what's wrong?\" Then son has agency and can answer yes, or no, and that's that.  And the class, for their part, has a plan that they can follow where they are part of working on the solution (their part is acknowledging that your son is having trouble and following their plan).    Also love the idea of a hand signal like mentioned upthread.  Like your son could put his hands on his ears to say \"not open for questioning right now/I am working on calming down alone\"", "Yep. What\u2019s wrong, how can we stop it and how can we prevent it from happening again?"]}
