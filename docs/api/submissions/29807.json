I had a very traumatic miscarriage at 3m in May of 2023 and after being so excited I was met with so much heartbreak. \n\nI have two healthy babies (5&3). My first two I had zero issues, healthy as can be.The third pregnancy started out the same and we were just over the moon. We told everyone and anyone pretty much as soon as I found out I was pregnant. When I miscarried, I was just bombarded with questions and condolences when all I wanted was to not talk about it. \n\nNow, my MIL and I don't have the greatest relationship. We've had some challenges over the last couple of years but never anything explosive. She's just a very cold person in general and also lives halfway around the world so we don't see or speak to each other much. Which is a bonus in my books. \n\nI've been with my husband for 10 years, i've tried to connect with her so many times in person and would call her all the time on video so she can interact with the kids. I just stopped trying after so many disappointing interactions. We didn't have a chance to tell her that we were pregnant with my first child because that opportunity was taken from us by my SIL. That's another story itself. With my second, we were excited to tell her and her reaction was \u201cthat's nice\" followed by a subject change. I was so hurt. \n\nWhen I was back home this past summer I told her about our miscarriage and she didn't even acknowledge it. She acted like she didn't hear me & immediately changed the subject. I am now almost 11 weeks. Close to where I was when lost my last baby. I told my husband that I don't want to tell any of our family back home. We both have all of our family living halfway across the world. I said I just wanted to surprise them with a photo when baby arrives and be like, surprise. This includes everyone. My family - His family. \n\nHe is adamant about telling his mom we are expecting and I'm really hurt by this. I told him multiple times I don't want anyone to know & especially his mom after her lack of compassion or excitement. Her reactions are always disappointing.\n\nHe said that he would tell her not to tell anyone but she can't keep a secret to save her life. She has told every family member and person she knows about a private health matter in my life from two years ago. I don't trust her with this news. \n\nWith this pregnancy, I feel extremely protective. I don't want to wave it around, I want to keep it private. It's hard for me to talk about this pregnancy or even be excited. Deep down, I pray that this baby is born healthy and happy. But to say things like \"I can't wait to snuggle this baby\" is really difficult for me because of the what if's. My miscarriage was extremely traumatic and l'm still not over it.

Seems like this is a deeper issue, though. Your husband really needs to acknowledge his mother\u2019s destructive behavior and adjust his attitude accordingly.\n\n*I say this as a man, with a very narcissistic mother, in a long term relationship. It took a lot of time and pointing out from my gf until I truly stopped gaslighting myself and acknowledged how toxic my mother is", "NTA. At all. A miscarriage is a traumatic experience and how you choose to handle your next pregnancy is your choice. I don\u2019t understand why he is adamant she know considering her underwhelming response previously. Have you asked him this?", "NAH- I understand both you and your husbands position. \n\nIf I may offer a piece for you though: Let go of any and all expectations with your MIL. Her reaction should not affect you so deeply. You have no relationship with this woman, so why are you giving her so much of yourself mentally and emotionally. Let her be cold. And know that the attitude she has halfway around the world WILL NOT affect you unless you allow it to. Stop letting her live in your head rent free.", "NAH I would find it very hard to keep a secret like that for 9 months. I sympathize with your worries but I do think there needs to be a compromise. Clearly your husband likes to talk through things like this, it might even help his grief. Stay strong and work together", "I think I\u2019m going light YTA. Don\u2019t tell anyone until 12 weeks? Totally reasonable? Don\u2019t tell anyone until 20 weeks? Also reasonable in the circumstances. Don\u2019t tell anyone until the baby is born? I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a reasonable demand of your partner. You\u2019re unilaterally deciding when you announce your baby, and you\u2019re not taking any of his input. Because pregnancy is a medical event for a woman, I\u2019m generally of the opinion that men should follow their wives\u2019 lead on the topic of announcing. But I think you\u2019ve taken it past the point of reasonability. \n\nRemember, the risks will never completely go away. Babies can die of SIDS. Kids die of cancer. Teens die in car accidents. There will never be a point where everything is 100% safe with this baby. However, after 12 weeks, your miscarriage risk drops* from 20-30% to 1-5%. After 20 weeks, your risk of miscarriage\u2014now stillbirth\u2014drops to approximately 0.5%.\n\nOf course, statistics aren\u2019t going to make your worries magically disappear. My oldest had a traumatic birth, and the doctors told me I had no increased risk of it happening again. While that was reassuring, I DEFINITELY still had worries going into my next pregnancy. I get it. But sometimes, you have to admit to yourself that your anxiety isn\u2019t rational, and it isn\u2019t fair to hold your spouse to the path your anxiety demands. \n\nI\u2019m not saying he should just tell his mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s earned that. I think whatever you decide on, it should be everyone or no one. But maybe you compromise and tell people at 20 weeks. Maybe even at 30 weeks. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make him go along with this plan to say, \u201cSurprise! Here\u2019s a baby!\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want that. \n\n*It\u2019s actually already decreased a lot. Each week of pregnancy leads to lower rates of miscarriage. I\u2019m just talking in large chunks for the sake of simplicity.", "NTA. You said you MIL shared a private health matter of yours to everyone just to years ago, you're right not to trust her to keep this private.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that your family and his might feel hurt and upset if you only tell them about the baby after s/he is born. It's your decision when you want to tell them, and you wouldn't be an asshole no matter what you do imo, but you should just have that in mind and be aware of it if you decide to wait that long to tell them.", "NTA. Miscarriages are traumatic and the next pregnancy can trigger PTSD. It\u2019s hard to feel excited with the worry that things can go wrong is hanging around the back of your mind, and everyone will expect you to be excited as if you haven\u2019t just had a miscarriage. Only tell people when you are both on board with telling people.", "INFO: You said you didn\u2019t want to discuss your miscarriage. But, you\u2019re upset MIL didn\u2019t discuss your miscarriage. What?", "Thank you so much for the comment, understanding and kind words!", "NAH\n\nBut FFS why was this not discussed and agreed upon before the fact?", "NTA- with a reaction like that I wouldn\u2019t want to tell her either. With the way you\u2019re feeling, the only reason to tell someone would be so they can support you no matter what happens and you know you\u2019re not getting that from her. The only reason she\u2019ll be happy you told her is so she can be the one with the \u201cgossip\u201d and have the opportunity to tell everyone herself. On top of that it sounds like she\u2019s the type of person to tell everyone in a smug way like \u201ccan you believe she\u2019s pregnant again?\u201d Or something along those lines. She doesn\u2019t sound like a good person who deserves to know especially before you\u2019re comfortable telling the world. She\u2019ll probably be mad that you didn\u2019t tell her right away but only because she wants to be the first to know everything, not because she plans on being a supportive and positive influence in your life. She doesn\u2019t deserve to know before you decide to tell everyone else. I wouldn\u2019t doubt it if your husband only wants to tell her right away for the fact that he\u2019ll get backlash from her for not telling her first. Just speculation but she sounds like the type. At the end of the day you\u2019re setting a boundary and he should respect that considering what you\u2019ve been through and how she reacted. There\u2019s an obvious reason you don\u2019t feel comfortable telling her too soon. But congratulations!! I hope everything goes smoothly and you have the happiest and healthiest little nugget in 6(ish) months \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.  Die on this hill, especially before 15 weeks.", "INFO aint she gon find out anyway?", "NTA. You do you.", "NTA, but if you can seek therapy and/or a support group to help with your (very reasonable) worries & grief, I think that would help you be able to hold all of these conflicting emotions at once (excitement, fear, worry, etc). You\u2019re not alone in these feelings & thats a lot to hold. \n\nYour partner could also use some therapy, & maybe some couples counseling. You both went through a very traumatic experience. It also sounds like he\u2019s used to being gaslit by his mom, & he wants something from her he just isn\u2019t going to get, which may be that he wants comfort & support from her, but hasn\u2019t been able to face that she just cannot give that to him", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly warm at all and has a bad history of sharing news that\u2019s not hers to share with others. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to tell her anything. Let alone the joy of a child which she would probably not react to well regardless. \n\nYour husband should support you in your decision here especially after going through the miscarriage. That must have been so difficult for you. Sure, he went through it as well, but the trauma of having to have your dead unborn child removed from you? He did not have to go through that. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through that again. No mother should ever have to experience that. \n\nHave a talk with your husband and tell him why after the traumatic miscarriage, you just no longer want to have the burden of telling everyone until the baby is safe and in your hands. If he can\u2019t understand the anxiety and trauma you face, he\u2019s the AH.", "First sorry for your loss and I hope you are healing from the miscarriage. My sister had one and it was devastating for her, and us as extended family.\n\nYoure NTA. Your MIL is and the sooner you cut her out of your life the better it will be. Or at least don't give her so much emotional real estate. She doesn't deserve it they was she has treated you.\n\nI wish you all the best with this pregnancy OP.", "NTA, I feel like this is very much a \u201cyour body your choice\u201d situation. Yes the baby is both of yours, but like the pregnancy is happening to you and you\u2019re entitled to set boundaries around it", "Absolutely, positively, without any reservations, you are NTA. I am a husband and I am angry with your husband for violating one of the most simple rules of husband behavior: it is our duty to prioritize and protect the physical and emotional health of our wife and children before anyone and everyone else. It\u2019s that simple. If my wife told me she couldn\u2019t deal with my mother knowing something, my mother would never hear a word about it. He needs to prioritize your emotional wellbeing. That said, if you are not in counseling or therapy, I hope you will consider it, for yourself and for your family. I do speak from the experience of losing a child, although mine died of cancer at the age of 18. On some level you know the pain of losing a child at any stage of development will never completely go away. But I\u2019m worried that your plan to wait until this baby is born to announce your pregnancy may be a little extreme. I understand the feelings behind it, but it involves a kind of denial and abnegation that has the potential to suck any possible joy and anticipatory excitement out of *this* pregnancy (for everyone). Obviously you are in a precarious condition and don\u2019t want to take anything for granted; also the pregnancy/miscarriage statistics are not particularly comforting for anyone, so that makes it doubly hard on you because of your recent loss. You may benefit from some outside help as you navigate this situation. Finally, if you want me to write more about why your husband *is* the AH, I could go on for another hour or so. I wish you the best and although I\u2019m not much of a pray-er, I do hope things go well and you find a way to lightness, comfort, and hope.", "I mean, as long as it's fair on all sides, NTA. Hubby should be listening to you.\n\nMaybe let him do a trial run. Tell her something small and maybe a little untrue, tell her she can't tell anyone. See what happens. If anyone outside of MIL mentions it, tell hubby, \"This was her chance and she blew it, no more information for her. If you tell her anyway, I won't be telling you anything either.\" Direct and blunt? 100% sometimes, you gotta be though.", "NTA\n\nIt's traumatic to lose a child, no matter if it was premature and parents have a hard time dealing with it.\n\nYour MIL seems to be a lil weirdo though. I understand your past experiences with her have been disappointing so the hesitation in letting her know about your pregnancy. \n\nBut I am not sure if you are putting your husband in a tight spot regarding with whom he is sharing the news regarding the pregnancy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also your husband's suggestion to tell his mom and expect her to keep the secret is equally unrealistic and naive. \nWaiting for both anomaly scans to complete at around 20 weeks is a reasonable compromise and an extension of the 12 week guidance. \nAll things considered, your lived experience means you can't be called an AH but if you stick to your guns your putting your husband in a pretty miserably difficult position to wait till the birth to share the news.", "Soft YTA. It is understandable that you feel differently this pregnancy after having had a miscarriage and not sharing the news until after you scan etc is completely normal. I hope once you get a little further into the pregnancy your anxiety will begin to reduce. When you can feel your baby move each day you will feel more reassured. However you need to appreciate your husband also lost a baby and is expecting another baby too.

I am sure I will get down voted for this but it\u2019s your husband\u2019s baby too. I can understand waiting until 20 weeks but it is strange to wait until the baby is literally born and just be like \u201csurprise.\u201d Do you think your other two kids aren\u2019t going to notice you getting fat, preparing a nursery etc and they are going to mention anything?", "YTA This isn't just your baby, it is his too.\n\n I understand the stress and worry of going through a pregnancy after a miscarriage. My first pregnancy ended in a missed miscarriage and I needed a DNC to remove the foetus. I was an absolute wreck during my second pregnancy and didn't trust my body at all. The worry eased slightly once I could feel the baby move, but that was a double edged sword, because I panicked if too much time went between movements. I just knew I was not going to feel safe until I had my baby in my arms. However, the thought of not telling my family and friends I was pregnant again, never entered my head. I did wait to the 12 week mark that time, as like you I had told everyone I was pregnant as soon as I found out first time round and having to tell people about a miscarriage adds to the heartbreak. But having the support of my friends and family helped me get through my pregnancy. When my fears and worries would start to overwhelm me, they were there to talk me down. \n\nWhat you are demanding of your husband is selfish. You are both pregnant and get an equal say in when you tell people. He wants to tell his mum, so you are going to have to come up with a compromise on when he can. Forcing him to go through this pregnancy with no support from family or friends is cruel. \n\n\nAlso, sending a message \"Ta Da, we've had a baby\" is NOT a \"cute surprise\".

I know that everyone is flawed and I try so hard to come into these feeling impartial\u2026 it just never, ever seems to disappoint? I think it\u2019s more their generation than anything, sadly. You are NTA at all here. Your husband is a silly boy if he can\u2019t look at his moms actions realistically. I am sending you so much love.", "Have you explained how hard it is going to be if he tells his mother now and you lose this baby too? Then he has to tell the entire family because she\u2019s told everyone. Doesn\u2019t he understand explaining the loss and having sympathy makes the loss even worse for you? Doesn\u2019t he care that it\u2019s not about his family versus your family, but the actual death of a child? Maybe explaining it in these terms will help him understand that you are afraid. If he is excited about this baby and wants to share the news, he has to wait to know that the baby will actually be born. This is harsh but he needs to be hit in the head with reality.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been badly hurt. That sounds like a totally  logical decision to me. You are carrying this child. Physically suffering the symptoms.

I mean she probably has done other stuff to make that the default lens you view her through, so I'm not saying she handled it well either, but maybe it wasn't intentionally malicious either, some people just don't express their feelings very well...", "NTA. I\u2019m very sorry about your miscarriage.", "NTA. I\u2019d be willing to die on this hill. It\u2019s a medical matter. You\u2019re dealing with a very recent trauma. Your husband needs to see a therapist and a marriage counselor.", "Is there a middle ground here?", "NTA\nCurrently 28 weeks after a loss last year and I want to punch people in the face when they tell me how exciting this pregnancy is.  I am fucking terrified. So I get that deep fear you are feeling. Ask your husband why he needs to tell her when she had nothing comforting or helpful to say to you. Tell him how you are feeling and ask him why he would want to make things more difficult for you by having to manage his mothers reaction as well. He should be supporting you here.", "I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it, OP, but you need some grief counseling to help you process your sadness, anxiety, and all the other emotions that you have after the miscarriage. You\u2019re asking your husband to keep a BIG secret for 40 weeks. What if one of your kids spills the beans on the phone with someone?", "While this baby is in her body, it\u2019s reasonable.", "This! Thank you for saying it!", "Did you not read the entire post?", "I ll say you are not TA. However as someone who went through lost like you did , I was provided with therapy as it's part of medical help where I live . Unfortunately only mothers have this, and it's understandable because our bodies go through change and physical pain. But until it happened second time I was not aware how much took mentally on my husband. He was trying to be strong for me but I found him once curled up crying. So although I understand truly how much pain you are going through, you have to understand that your husband is going through pain too, and how ever cold your MIL seems to you, maybe she is \"rock\" he needs to help him with this.

I understand you are protective, but your \"how cute\" moment will not be taken that way and right now your husband is communicating he is not ok with that decision for whatever reason. \nYes, your body, your rules and your MIL is a harpy. Not saying nothing against that or that Y T A, but if your husband is a great guy barring this and your MIL is effectively out of your life for practical reasons, why don't you compromise on a date? Like 25 weeks or something like that? That way he gets to tell his parents, you will be more \"statistically\" safe of any dangers and everything is more fluid. \n\nSometimes you can be right but finding a comprise is the best way to go for your own interest. And also try to send your husband to therapy if he has issues with his parents.", "I know people who announced after the baby was born. It was received with shock and deep upset by immediate family.

You have trauma relating to pregnancy now, and you are trying to exert control over the situation. \n\nHowever, I think forcing your husband to keep it a secret the entire pregnancy is not reasonable and Y W B T A for that. Waiting until 20 weeks? Or even viability at 24? Yes, that is more reasonable.\n\nI mean this in all kindness - you need to deal with your trauma rather than forcing other people to enable you. I strongly recommend getting counseling or therapy to help you get through. Because pregnancies can be stressful and scary, and by trying to pretend you\u2019re not pregnant (which I assume may be the case since you don\u2019t want to talk about it) is not a good way to cope.

It is incredibly strange and absolutely manipulative of your husband to insist on telling his family.  My read of this is that he is strongly bound by a cultural norm.  I get that.\n\nWhat isn't a cultural norm - and it SHOULD BE - is the fact that a miscarriage of a child that is very much wanted and loved before birth, is like experiencing a death.  The fact that this happens inside your body makes it unbearably horrible.  \n\nI am so happy for you that you're carrying another baby, but your anxiety is absolutely understandable.  You're still grieving the miscarriage.  Your husband likely doesn't appreciate how profoundly it has affected you.  I don't want to sound like a misanthrope, but men just can't appreciate what our bodies go through to carry a baby.  It is not their bodies and brains that go through the pains, hormonal and physical changes of periods, never mind birth.\n\nThere are in fact, many people and some cultures, that do not announce any pregnancy until well into the second trimester.  Even then, they won't have any baby showers or celebrations until after the child is born.   It is considered bad luck.\n\nMy husband I recently attended a 100 day birthday celebration, given by our Chinese friends, to mark the birth of their child.  This practise dates back to the days when the first 100 days after birth were most critical.  A baby that survived 100 days was most likely to survive into adulthood.\n\nI hope the scales drop from your husband's eyes so that he can see how much you are still grieving the miscarriage.  Another pregnancy does not replace the one you lost; they're not fungible.  I know you will never forget.  \n\nIf you can, please seek out therapy or a support circle of other women that have had similar experiences.  \n\nMay this pregnancy go well and may your baby be bouncy and healthy.   \n\nMay your husband come to understand that you just need breathing space and kindness while you navigate through the joy and terror of facing a pregnancy so soon after the trauma of such a loss.\n\nThis grandmother sends you hugs.", "Ask him what's important the feelings of his mommy, someone who dislikes you, was cold unfeeling about your TRAUMATIC miscarriage & can't keep a secret if their life dependened on it.

Let\u2019s say he tells his mother, against your wishes, who tells all of his family, who then tell your family, who blow up your phone upset that they were singled out not to be told. Then you\u2019re crying for days. God forbid, if anything happened to this pregnancy, you would always think your husband\u2019s betrayal contributed to it. \n\nNo one has a right to know about this pregnancy, except for you and him. Not your kids, not his family, not your family, and not friends.  \n\nYou want to retreat into your cave with your mate guarding the door, protecting you, and instead he\u2019s letting all the stress in. \n\nTell him that.", "Pleases leave him tho I manipulation", ">Not every deal-breaker has to be carried a \"boundary\".\n\n*Thank you*\n\nThat word is becoming such an overused buzzword that it barely means anything anymore. It's frustrating because it used to be a good way of communicating, but with people using it in every sentence (a \"hard boundary\" doesn't mean anything!!!) it's become virtually useless.", "Being that she's carrying the baby, it's her boundary to make. If she wants to make it a deal breaker, that's fine too.", "You need to challenge him about why he doesn't trust you. Lack of trust is by far the biggest issue here. That's what you need to get to the bottom of.", ">He said he\u2019s sure I will secretly tell my family which hurts me tbh. \n\nThat's extremely disrespectful.", "Well you CAN'T trust his mother. And you DEFINITELY CAN'T trust HIM", "Does he have any reason to believe that you would tell them or in the past have you relayed information to them that you were not supposed to? Has his mother told information to others when she was told not to? \n\nWhen you start showing  wont people know? And when the people in your life around you now (Neighbors friends coworkers) see your expecting would you be more open to telling your family members who live around the world?", "Exactly. As women no one needs to share the news of our pregnancies, our menstrual cycle, our menopause our gyno visits etc. Just because our vagina is involved does not make the medical info community property at the whim of the man who put his penis there.", "Yes technically it's her pregnancy with semantics and I'm sure there are some people who abuse the phrase 'our pregnancy' but it's more widely used for expecting parents and the emotioals and social side of pregnancy. Yes, the experiences aren't identical but it's unrealistic and cruel to expect him to be quiet until after the pregnancy. That's saying he needs to be a full and only support to OP and have no support himself. It will be even worse if something does go wrong.", "In this day and age we have all kinds of contraception. Accidentally getting pregnant when you are still emotionally distraught sounds a little dodgy. Also I know this is probably difficult to hear but almost 30% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. It\u2019s difficult and awful but it\u2019s the way of babies. Forcing your husband to remain silent about your advanced pregnancy seems manipulative. His mom probably reacted the way she did because miscarriages are a normal part of a woman\u2019s life. She\u2019s probably had one too. She didn\u2019t give you the response you wanted but that doesn\u2019t make her not worthy of knowing you\u2019re about to have a baby. Also.. families spill the tea about each other. It\u2019s normal. You\u2019re acting as if she maliciously slandered you when in reality she was probably worried about you. Your husband is right and you should get some therapy.", "Best advice so far!", "Bonus: every hour OP's husband spends in therapy managing his issues is one less hour each of his kids will have to spend managing his issues for him at adults.", "THIS. His lack of respect for you is sad. NTA", "I agree with you to a certain degree.\n\nBut I do not think the husband is wrong at all.\n\nHis way of processing and dealing with the past trauma is to share good news with others.\n\nOP feels differently.\n\nI think both are NTA.\n\nThe issue is how do they reach an acceptable compromise so neither feels resentment.", "It seems to me that it is OP that has the \"issues\", control being one of them.", "Its her pregnancy not his.he has no right to share her body or news about her body unless she wants it shared.  a man's grief over a past miscarriage does not override a woman's current stress in regards to a pregnancy she is currently carrying.", "Sorry husband needs to recognise that while his loss of his unborn child was traumatic for him, it's even more traumatic for his wife.\n\nTherefore once he gets the chance to step back and reflect on his emotions and the situation he must choose to put his wife over himself and not deal with his trauma by inflicting trauma on her.", "Has he already told his mother perhaps?", "Maybe he doesn't feel supported by you in regards to your family.....or his.\n\nI'm sure he also feels that if you were ever to divorce it will be because of your attitude towards his family.\n\nPerhaps, you are not so innocent but  the problem.", "You meant, traumatic miscarriage being one of them?", "One of the most clueless comments I\u2019ve ever read on here. And that\u2019s saying something.", "It's his child just as much as hers.\n\nHe can tell people he is going to be a father.\n\nHe does not have to mention her at all.\n\nWith her controlling behavior, I would not mention her, why spoil the vibe?", "Sorry but her trauma does not trump his.\n\nThey both suffered a tremendous loss and they both have different ways of dealing with and healing from that loss.\n\nIf sharing with his family helps him to heal and to focus on the positive, then that is what he must do for himself.\n\nIf not sharing with anyone helps her, then that is what she must do for herself.\n\nAre you saying that her trauma supersedes his?\n\nThey both suffered trauma.\n\nHe is not \"inflicting\" his trauma on her if no one discusses or mentions anything pregnancy or baby related to her.\n\nShe, however, is inflicting her trauma on him if she forbids the telling the good news to his family.\n\nShe is inflicting her trauma on him by restricting and controlling him, which is exactly what she is doing.", "Sounds like he's only the most caring person when it happens to be convenient for him.", "Perhaps she is stirring up the problems with his family.\n\nShe is up\\[set because MIL did not react according to OP's expectations.\n\nSome people do not know what to say or do when told news, either exciting or sad.\n\nAnd often do or say the wrong thing.\n\nOP is only concerned with her feelings.", "If he has, then everyone in his family would be blowing up OP's phone. His mother can't keep a secret to save her life.", "I know! And she has good cause not to feel comfortable sharing with mil. Totally legitimate.", "I mean the traumatic loss of their child.\n\nShe seems to only be considering her feelings, her loss and no consideration for the feelings of her husband, his trauma, his pain.\n\nOnly me......Me........ME.", "\ud83d\ude01 Then you should reread some of yours......\ud83d\ude04", "He's married. If he says he's going to be a father he is automatically outing HER pregnancy...unless he is announcing an infidelity.\nShe has the right to control info about HER body. Once a child is born he can announce it. But there is no child yet. There is a pregnancy which is HER body. Being pregnant by him does not give Him any rights or authority over her body. If he loved and respected her he would support her decision to keep her pregnancy between them and her doctors.", "They both suffered emotional trauma but she also experienced a physical trauma that he did not", "Those are two opposing reactions.  They can not operate at the same time.", "What? If he tells his mom, and because of his mom's problem with keeping secrets, EVERYONE is going to know.\n\nThis means questions about the pregnancy she's not ready to answer and worse still, having to explain TOUCHWOOD another miscarriage. This is 100% inflicting trauma on her, because guess who people ask about the pregnancy? The mom!\n\nThe best compromise is if his mom can just keep her mouth shut honestly.", "OP is only concerned with her feelings *about the traumatic event she suffered*. Let's be specific here. If OP's husband wanted to tell his mom for emotional support for him (because miscarriages can be hard on any parent, not just the mom) that would be different and would be worth discussing.", "You\u2019re just full of bad takes, aren\u2019t ya! (The answer is yes)", "No one is asking her to share with her MIL.\n\nHusband wants to share with his mother.", "Of course he has feelings. Doesn\u2019t mean he should completely disregard his wife\u2019s feeling. She was the one carrying the baby. She\u2019s the one who physically miscarried. You\u2019ve obviously never been pregnant.", "If there is no child yet, then what is all the trauma about for either of them?\n\nThe miscarriage would have carried no weight for either of them, right?\n\nBut there is a child and they both love the child already.\n\nShe is controlling her body.\n\nHusband is not claiming any rights over her body, \ud83d\ude01\n\nNo one needs to talk about her body.\n\nHusband can talk about his impending fatherhood.\n\nHe is excited about his child.\n\nIf OP loved and respected him she would support his decision to tell his family.", "Yes, they can.\n\nHusband tells only his mother.\n\nAnd wife tells no one.\n\nThey can each subscribe to his or her own POV.", "Well, Husband has said that OP will not keep the news to herself and that his wife will tell her mother and has stated so.\n\nThere must be a reason for him to believe she will spread the news and that he has said so to OP.\n\nSwearing MIL to secrecy is all that can be done.\n\nHusband has the right to confide in his mother.", "It's hard on both parents but here his way of dealing with the trauma (telling his mom) is creating more trauma for her (bad memories of previous miscarriage) so he'd better choose his wife over himself and get himself into therapy to deal with his trauma instead", "Nope, not bad takes, unbiased, objective takes.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I have not heard any thing awful from MIL, other than she did not exhibit the \"proper\" responses to the news.\n\nOP is upset because MIL did not behave as OP deemed fit.\n\nSheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.............................................................."]}
