I had a very traumatic miscarriage at 3m in May of 2023 and after being so excited I was met with so much heartbreak. \n\nI have two healthy babies (5&3). My first two I had zero issues, healthy as can be.The third pregnancy started out the same and we were just over the moon. We told everyone and anyone pretty much as soon as I found out I was pregnant. When I miscarried, I was just bombarded with questions and condolences when all I wanted was to not talk about it. \n\nNow, my MIL and I don't have the greatest relationship. We've had some challenges over the last couple of years but never anything explosive. She's just a very cold person in general and also lives halfway around the world so we don't see or speak to each other much. Which is a bonus in my books. \n\nI've been with my husband for 10 years, i've tried to connect with her so many times in person and would call her all the time on video so she can interact with the kids. I just stopped trying after so many disappointing interactions. We didn't have a chance to tell her that we were pregnant with my first child because that opportunity was taken from us by my SIL. That's another story itself. With my second, we were excited to tell her and her reaction was \u201cthat's nice\" followed by a subject change. I was so hurt. \n\nWhen I was back home this past summer I told her about our miscarriage and she didn't even acknowledge it. She acted like she didn't hear me & immediately changed the subject. I am now almost 11 weeks. Close to where I was when lost my last baby. I told my husband that I don't want to tell any of our family back home. We both have all of our family living halfway across the world. I said I just wanted to surprise them with a photo when baby arrives and be like, surprise. This includes everyone. My family - His family. \n\nHe is adamant about telling his mom we are expecting and I'm really hurt by this. I told him multiple times I don't want anyone to know & especially his mom after her lack of compassion or excitement. Her reactions are always disappointing.\n\nHe said that he would tell her not to tell anyone but she can't keep a secret to save her life. She has told every family member and person she knows about a private health matter in my life from two years ago. I don't trust her with this news. \n\nWith this pregnancy, I feel extremely protective. I don't want to wave it around, I want to keep it private. It's hard for me to talk about this pregnancy or even be excited. Deep down, I pray that this baby is born healthy and happy. But to say things like \"I can't wait to snuggle this baby\" is really difficult for me because of the what if's. My miscarriage was extremely traumatic and l'm still not over it.

Seems like this is a deeper issue, though. Your husband really needs to acknowledge his mother\u2019s destructive behavior and adjust his attitude accordingly.\n\n*I say this as a man, with a very narcissistic mother, in a long term relationship. It took a lot of time and pointing out from my gf until I truly stopped gaslighting myself and acknowledged how toxic my mother is", "NTA. At all. A miscarriage is a traumatic experience and how you choose to handle your next pregnancy is your choice. I don\u2019t understand why he is adamant she know considering her underwhelming response previously. Have you asked him this?", "NAH- I understand both you and your husbands position. \n\nIf I may offer a piece for you though: Let go of any and all expectations with your MIL. Her reaction should not affect you so deeply. You have no relationship with this woman, so why are you giving her so much of yourself mentally and emotionally. Let her be cold. And know that the attitude she has halfway around the world WILL NOT affect you unless you allow it to. Stop letting her live in your head rent free.", "NAH I would find it very hard to keep a secret like that for 9 months. I sympathize with your worries but I do think there needs to be a compromise. Clearly your husband likes to talk through things like this, it might even help his grief. Stay strong and work together", "I think I\u2019m going light YTA. Don\u2019t tell anyone until 12 weeks? Totally reasonable? Don\u2019t tell anyone until 20 weeks? Also reasonable in the circumstances. Don\u2019t tell anyone until the baby is born? I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a reasonable demand of your partner. You\u2019re unilaterally deciding when you announce your baby, and you\u2019re not taking any of his input. Because pregnancy is a medical event for a woman, I\u2019m generally of the opinion that men should follow their wives\u2019 lead on the topic of announcing. But I think you\u2019ve taken it past the point of reasonability. \n\nRemember, the risks will never completely go away. Babies can die of SIDS. Kids die of cancer. Teens die in car accidents. There will never be a point where everything is 100% safe with this baby. However, after 12 weeks, your miscarriage risk drops* from 20-30% to 1-5%. After 20 weeks, your risk of miscarriage\u2014now stillbirth\u2014drops to approximately 0.5%.\n\nOf course, statistics aren\u2019t going to make your worries magically disappear. My oldest had a traumatic birth, and the doctors told me I had no increased risk of it happening again. While that was reassuring, I DEFINITELY still had worries going into my next pregnancy. I get it. But sometimes, you have to admit to yourself that your anxiety isn\u2019t rational, and it isn\u2019t fair to hold your spouse to the path your anxiety demands. \n\nI\u2019m not saying he should just tell his mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s earned that. I think whatever you decide on, it should be everyone or no one. But maybe you compromise and tell people at 20 weeks. Maybe even at 30 weeks. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make him go along with this plan to say, \u201cSurprise! Here\u2019s a baby!\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want that. \n\n*It\u2019s actually already decreased a lot. Each week of pregnancy leads to lower rates of miscarriage. I\u2019m just talking in large chunks for the sake of simplicity.", "NTA. You said you MIL shared a private health matter of yours to everyone just to years ago, you're right not to trust her to keep this private.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that your family and his might feel hurt and upset if you only tell them about the baby after s/he is born. It's your decision when you want to tell them, and you wouldn't be an asshole no matter what you do imo, but you should just have that in mind and be aware of it if you decide to wait that long to tell them.", "NTA. Miscarriages are traumatic and the next pregnancy can trigger PTSD. It\u2019s hard to feel excited with the worry that things can go wrong is hanging around the back of your mind, and everyone will expect you to be excited as if you haven\u2019t just had a miscarriage. Only tell people when you are both on board with telling people.", "INFO: You said you didn\u2019t want to discuss your miscarriage. But, you\u2019re upset MIL didn\u2019t discuss your miscarriage. What?", "Thank you so much for the comment, understanding and kind words!", "NAH\n\nBut FFS why was this not discussed and agreed upon before the fact?", "NTA- with a reaction like that I wouldn\u2019t want to tell her either. With the way you\u2019re feeling, the only reason to tell someone would be so they can support you no matter what happens and you know you\u2019re not getting that from her. The only reason she\u2019ll be happy you told her is so she can be the one with the \u201cgossip\u201d and have the opportunity to tell everyone herself. On top of that it sounds like she\u2019s the type of person to tell everyone in a smug way like \u201ccan you believe she\u2019s pregnant again?\u201d Or something along those lines. She doesn\u2019t sound like a good person who deserves to know especially before you\u2019re comfortable telling the world. She\u2019ll probably be mad that you didn\u2019t tell her right away but only because she wants to be the first to know everything, not because she plans on being a supportive and positive influence in your life. She doesn\u2019t deserve to know before you decide to tell everyone else. I wouldn\u2019t doubt it if your husband only wants to tell her right away for the fact that he\u2019ll get backlash from her for not telling her first. Just speculation but she sounds like the type. At the end of the day you\u2019re setting a boundary and he should respect that considering what you\u2019ve been through and how she reacted. There\u2019s an obvious reason you don\u2019t feel comfortable telling her too soon. But congratulations!! I hope everything goes smoothly and you have the happiest and healthiest little nugget in 6(ish) months \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.  Die on this hill, especially before 15 weeks.", "INFO aint she gon find out anyway?", "NTA. You do you.", "NTA, but if you can seek therapy and/or a support group to help with your (very reasonable) worries & grief, I think that would help you be able to hold all of these conflicting emotions at once (excitement, fear, worry, etc). You\u2019re not alone in these feelings & thats a lot to hold. \n\nYour partner could also use some therapy, & maybe some couples counseling. You both went through a very traumatic experience. It also sounds like he\u2019s used to being gaslit by his mom, & he wants something from her he just isn\u2019t going to get, which may be that he wants comfort & support from her, but hasn\u2019t been able to face that she just cannot give that to him", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly warm at all and has a bad history of sharing news that\u2019s not hers to share with others. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to tell her anything. Let alone the joy of a child which she would probably not react to well regardless. \n\nYour husband should support you in your decision here especially after going through the miscarriage. That must have been so difficult for you. Sure, he went through it as well, but the trauma of having to have your dead unborn child removed from you? He did not have to go through that. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through that again. No mother should ever have to experience that. \n\nHave a talk with your husband and tell him why after the traumatic miscarriage, you just no longer want to have the burden of telling everyone until the baby is safe and in your hands. If he can\u2019t understand the anxiety and trauma you face, he\u2019s the AH.", "First sorry for your loss and I hope you are healing from the miscarriage. My sister had one and it was devastating for her, and us as extended family.\n\nYoure NTA. Your MIL is and the sooner you cut her out of your life the better it will be. Or at least don't give her so much emotional real estate. She doesn't deserve it they was she has treated you.\n\nI wish you all the best with this pregnancy OP.", "NTA, I feel like this is very much a \u201cyour body your choice\u201d situation. Yes the baby is both of yours, but like the pregnancy is happening to you and you\u2019re entitled to set boundaries around it", "Absolutely, positively, without any reservations, you are NTA. I am a husband and I am angry with your husband for violating one of the most simple rules of husband behavior: it is our duty to prioritize and protect the physical and emotional health of our wife and children before anyone and everyone else. It\u2019s that simple. If my wife told me she couldn\u2019t deal with my mother knowing something, my mother would never hear a word about it. He needs to prioritize your emotional wellbeing. That said, if you are not in counseling or therapy, I hope you will consider it, for yourself and for your family. I do speak from the experience of losing a child, although mine died of cancer at the age of 18. On some level you know the pain of losing a child at any stage of development will never completely go away. But I\u2019m worried that your plan to wait until this baby is born to announce your pregnancy may be a little extreme. I understand the feelings behind it, but it involves a kind of denial and abnegation that has the potential to suck any possible joy and anticipatory excitement out of *this* pregnancy (for everyone). Obviously you are in a precarious condition and don\u2019t want to take anything for granted; also the pregnancy/miscarriage statistics are not particularly comforting for anyone, so that makes it doubly hard on you because of your recent loss. You may benefit from some outside help as you navigate this situation. Finally, if you want me to write more about why your husband *is* the AH, I could go on for another hour or so. I wish you the best and although I\u2019m not much of a pray-er, I do hope things go well and you find a way to lightness, comfort, and hope.", "I mean, as long as it's fair on all sides, NTA. Hubby should be listening to you.\n\nMaybe let him do a trial run. Tell her something small and maybe a little untrue, tell her she can't tell anyone. See what happens. If anyone outside of MIL mentions it, tell hubby, \"This was her chance and she blew it, no more information for her. If you tell her anyway, I won't be telling you anything either.\" Direct and blunt? 100% sometimes, you gotta be though.", "NTA\n\nIt's traumatic to lose a child, no matter if it was premature and parents have a hard time dealing with it.\n\nYour MIL seems to be a lil weirdo though. I understand your past experiences with her have been disappointing so the hesitation in letting her know about your pregnancy. \n\nBut I am not sure if you are putting your husband in a tight spot regarding with whom he is sharing the news regarding the pregnancy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
