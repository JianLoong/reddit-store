{"id": 22466, "submission_id": "151wy3p", "title": "AITA for creating an unwelcoming environment for customers?", "selftext": "My SO and I have a new cafe together. SO manages the cafe, while I look after administration (generally away from customer interaction). We both work long hours and have barely enough time to do all our tasks.\n\nThe cafe has an outdoor area, and we have advertised the cafe as being dog friendly. The law states that dogs are allowed outside but not inside an enclosed space, which is the case for all other cafe and restaurant venues in our state. At our cafe, this makes ordering difficult for single customers with a dog because it can be awkward tying a dog to an outside table, especially if there is already someone sitting on it. We have a takeaway window that is accessible from outside, but it can be awkward telling customers to walk around to the side of our cafe with their dog to order for dine-in.\r  \n\r  \nSO and staff have been nonchalant about dogs entering into the cafe area (which is concrete floored) to order because of the above situation. I have not been approving because we have previously been cited by an OSHA Officer for having a dog inside another one of our venues.\n\nRecently, after a small (unleashed) dog entered the cafe and did its business on the floor, I got flustered and called the customer out (in view of other customers). The customer cleaned up part of the dog's mess, and I had to clean the rest of it off the floor (staff did not help), including disinfecting the floor. I have asked SO not to allow dogs inside (prior to this event and again after), and to train the staff accordingly, but have continued to see dog owners come to the counter inside to order.\r  \n\r  \nToday, while I worked on admin at the cafe, I saw a couple about to walk inside with their dog (on a lead), and so I jumped up from my work to tell them no dogs inside, and they could tie their dog to an outdoor (unused) table. This was in view of other customers yet again.\r  \n\r  \nSO was not happy and told me my behavior was embarrassing, awful, I should have stayed seated, and that I don't create a warming environment. SO said that he's been to other cafes where they let dogs inside for ordering, and that I can improve my engagement with customers and start at least by greeting them.\n\nI got upset at this and said that if he had shown me he could do his job, I would not have had to say anything. I told him that the fear of having OSHA catch a dog inside our venue (even if briefly while a dog owner was placing an order) makes me anxious. I told him that despite the number of times I have told him about this concern, I have seen no enforcement of the law, and that I don't trust him to do his job. SO got very upset, and told me he has been working hard, and said he feels like despite work long hours doing his best, he feels his work is not good enough for me.", "created_utc": 1689585938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151wy3p/aita_for_creating_an_unwelcoming_environment_for/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your SO need to sit down and firstly agree the process that you have in place.  Then work out a way to stick to it and back each other up.  \n\nYou\u2019ve provided space for people to bring dogs and place their orders outside if they have a dog.  Perhaps you need to consider making the ordering areas more clearly marked for customers and also make it clear that dogs cannot enter, before they are already inside the building.", "Nta. \n\nBut your cafe isn't doh friendly and if you stop advertising it that way the problems will stop. \n\nI work in a cafe that allows dogs outside but it's clear policy followed by everyone that they do not come inside. Never had a problem with people following the rules as long as they're clear and consistent.", "NTA.  You could never be the AH for firmly enforcing safety regs.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have a customer problem (well you do, but let's face it, every business does), you have a partner problem. If this is the law, and you've already received one citation for it, then it could potentially cost you a lot of money or even close your business down to continue to ignore the law. If you were an impartial business owner you would not want actions which risk your entire investment and future of your business.\n\nHowever, you can't act like a business owner, because your business partner is also your romantic partner and takes it personally and flips it around about how his work is not good enough. That's emotionally manipulation, he's trying to make you feel guilty and bad for criticizing a legitimate business element. You need to have a long discussion with him about the future of this business. If you cannot work together and agree on basic things like this, then it's going to destroy your relationship and your business.", "So, two things wrong here.\n\n1. You advertise as being dog-friendly, but your cafe isn\u2019t dog-friendly. If it was, your customers wouldn\u2019t have such difficulty ordering when they bring a dog.\n\n2. Your SO\u2019s job is to feed customers and give them a positive experience, not be the dog police in a, once again, \u2018dog-friendly\u2019 cafe. Moreover, it seems like your only interaction with the customers is negative.\n\nYTA. Stay in the BOH and figure out a solution to the dog-friendly problem.", "ESH, and by that I mean you and your partner. You have created a business and marketed it to a specific demographic but don\u2019t have the layout to give the customer what they expect based on your advertising. \n\nSo the customer is doing nothing wrong based on the info you\u2019ve given them, and are understandably disappointed/confused/upset when you come from the back yelling at them for doing what your advertisement said they can do. \n\nYou and SO need to get this sorted. Either stop advertising something you don\u2019t provide, or figure out a way to provide it within OSHA rules. \nWhy you don\u2019t have someone greet customers and take orders while they are outside is confusing to me as this would solve all the problems you\u2019ve presented. You say you have staff so train them correctly. \n\nAnd clarify you advertising that dogs are welcomed *outside* only so customers aren\u2019t blindsided when they arrive.", "ESH\n\nStop bickering & solve your problems. You don\u2019t have a dog friendly cafe. You have a dog friendly seating area. \n\nTying dogs to tables??? Not a solution. Hire a server for outside. \n\nEither figure out how to properly serve your customer or don\u2019t allow dogs.", "ESH. Honestly this is a business discussion. It sounds like you\u2019ll lose business if you do what you\u2019re doing. I suggest a sign saying you are pet friendly but accidents happen and you expect pet parents to clean up their kids accidents.", "Esh; how can you advertise it as dog friendly if your state law means you can\u2019t allow dogs inside? Doesn\u2019t make much sense. I know they can sit outside but the customer still has to come in to order and may not want to leave the dog outside or there may not be a free table", "Your cafe is dog friendly or it isn't. Yours clearly isn't if that's your attitude (laws aside).", "NTA."]}
