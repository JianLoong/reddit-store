SO manages the cafe, while I look after administration (generally away from customer interaction). We both work long hours and have barely enough time to do all our tasks.\n\nThe cafe has an outdoor area, and we have advertised the cafe as being dog friendly. The law states that dogs are allowed outside but not inside an enclosed space, which is the case for all other cafe and restaurant venues in our state. At our cafe, this makes ordering difficult for single customers with a dog because it can be awkward tying a dog to an outside table, especially if there is already someone sitting on it. We have a takeaway window that is accessible from outside, but it can be awkward telling customers to walk around to the side of our cafe with their dog to order for dine-in.\r  \n\r  \nSO and staff have been nonchalant about dogs entering into the cafe area (which is concrete floored) to order because of the above situation. I have not been approving because we have previously been cited by an OSHA Officer for having a dog inside another one of our venues.\n\nRecently, after a small (unleashed) dog entered the cafe and did its business on the floor, I got flustered and called the customer out (in view of other customers). The customer cleaned up part of the dog's mess, and I had to clean the rest of it off the floor (staff did not help), including disinfecting the floor. I have asked SO not to allow dogs inside (prior to this event and again after), and to train the staff accordingly, but have continued to see dog owners come to the counter inside to order.\r  \n\r  \nToday, while I worked on admin at the cafe, I saw a couple about to walk inside with their dog (on a lead), and so I jumped up from my work to tell them no dogs inside, and they could tie their dog to an outdoor (unused) table. This was in view of other customers yet again.\r  \n\r  \nSO was not happy and told me my behavior was embarrassing, awful, I should have stayed seated, and that I don't create a warming environment. SO said that he's been to other cafes where they let dogs inside for ordering, and that I can improve my engagement with customers and start at least by greeting them.\n\nI got upset at this and said that if he had shown me he could do his job, I would not have had to say anything. I told him that the fear of having OSHA catch a dog inside our venue (even if briefly while a dog owner was placing an order) makes me anxious. I told him that despite the number of times I have told him about this concern, I have seen no enforcement of the law, and that I don't trust him to do his job. SO got very upset, and told me he has been working hard, and said he feels like despite work long hours doing his best, he feels his work is not good enough for me.", "created_utc": 1689585938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151wy3p/aita_for_creating_an_unwelcoming_environment_for/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you were an impartial business owner you would not want actions which risk your entire investment and future of your business.\n\nHowever, you can't act like a business owner, because your business partner is also your romantic partner and takes it personally and flips it around about how his work is not good enough. That's emotionally manipulation, he's trying to make you feel guilty and bad for criticizing a legitimate business element.

Either stop advertising something you don\u2019t provide, or figure out a way to provide it within OSHA rules. \nWhy you don\u2019t have someone greet customers and take orders while they are outside is confusing to me as this would solve all the problems you\u2019ve presented.

Dog friendly means you have ways people can attend with your dog, but there are still limitations, because there are rules.
