I've seen a vegetarian get sick eating meat protein that they \\*wanted\\* to eat because their stomachs (or intestines or whatever) didn't handle it well after not having it for years.  I imagine your gut microbiome changes a lot when you eat no meat for years.  Maybe some enzymes that help break that protein down aren't there in sufficient amounts anymore?", "Speaking for myself my body knows when I accidentally eat dairy. But that is me. I\u2019m not sure on fish sauce since I ask questions or read labels before eating but some people don\u2019t realize dairy is non vegan when asked. \n\nI just correct them and deal with the stomach pain on my own without making a scene", "That's factually not true. People who don't eat meat for long amounts of time can no longer process meat proteins, and this is like a really foundational thing. Even just regular vegetarians who don't get small amounts of residual product because they're really careful just can't eat meat without being really sick for a while.", "I think it depends on how you got there though. I have a friend who has a very visceral reaction to knowing they\u2019ve eaten an animal product, because they were conditioned as a young child to believe that if they did so, they were responsible for animal torture (shown slaughter house videos as a kid along with being told it was their fault). \n\n\nSo perhaps you\u2019re referring to your first 21 years, and you overcame the same type of upbringing, in which case, I am legitimately happy for you.

Your gut biome can adapt if you cut something out long enough) and more just genetics", "I commented this earlier but I was vegetarian for like 7-8 years and then ate a bacon cheeseburger.

I don\u2019t like to order fish because it\u2019s not sustainable but in no way does that make me biased against those who do?

Flour gonna have some ground up for sure and any derivative like bread.\n\nHell I ate a bug on a walk earlier today just because I was talking.\n\nNot vegan, but I have food intolerances that I check before eating anything I didn't make.

If you can't see how you're being self-righteous or judgmental in return, then I can't help you. Because all of these people have probably had encounters with vegans that probably made them think of them in unfavorable terms. I have anemia, I have to eat red meat every couple of weeks or I get really sick, and when I pointed that out to a vegan once, he said people like me should \"just die\" to weed those kinds of diseases out because there was no use for us in this society.\n\nSo yeah. Vegans kind of do it themselves."]}
