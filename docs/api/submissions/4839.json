And I started following transgender people on YouTube to make sure i know their struggles and thoughts, I want my son in my life. \n\nWe talked about how things will change and he eventually broke down crying. It was a very hard talk so I didn't blame him, I let him cry but eventually he said that he hates his mother. Apparently she had caused much more of a ruckus, saying how he's a girl and just confused, and turned to screaming and ignoring him when he tried to talk to her about it more. \n\nI was livid and disappointed in my wife. Our son was everything to her and she always said she'll be there for him no matter what. \n\nSo after he calmed down, I wanted to cheer him up and took him to buy some guy clothes and even a buzzcut. It was a long day but full of laughs and I felt more connected to my son than ever. He even posted some pictures of us at McDonald's together after his \"makeover\".\n\nSo, I get back home and my wife is crying and angry at me. She says I'm \"feeding her daughter's delusions and turned her into an ugly monstrosity\" I tried calming her down so I could get things under control and maybe make her open up, but she kept screaming and eventually it resulted in a big argument and I ended up storming out. \n\nI haven't told my son yet, I don't know how it'll affect him but things are very tense in the house right now.

You see, parents are supposed to put their kid's happiness and health first, not cling to an antiquated version of the \"perfect child\" (for context, we have a child going through a similar thing so I know what you're dealing with! )\n\nYour wife needs some serious counselling and you might want to consider removing your child from the home (if possible) to protect their mental health, because what your wife is doing is abuse.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and please don't burden your son with the details of his mother's response to his makeover. It is probably clear enough anyway. \n\nYou can try couples counseling to see if you can get your wife on board with her new son, but sadly this does sometimes lead to divorce. Good for you for supporting your child.", "NTA. As someone who is trans, thank you, from the bottom of my heart for being there for your son and prioritising his wellbeing in this. I guarantee that day you two had will be a memory he will cherish for the rest of his life. You did the right thing by listening and supporting him to make the changes he wanted.\n\nSadly, opinions like your wife's are all too common. I hope that time will help her to get over the shock and come around, but I suspect not. In the meantime, I'd suggest doing everything you can to protect your son from having to hear her opinions and possibly also trying to direct her to some of the resources you found that might help her to understand what he's going through. Unfortunately, if she's unable to put her own feelings aside and support her son, you may need to consider divorce because he deserves to feel safe in his home. \n\nUltimately though, it's clear you love and care for your son and that's the most important thing. Having even one supportive adult can make a world of difference and that you're doing your best for him is fantastic. You've got this!", "You are definitely NTA. Thank you for supporting your son. If you divorce (I wouldn\u2019t blame you) you\u2019ll be able to provide a safe place for him.", "NTA your wife needs to get a grip. This stuff can be hard on parents but what she said about him being delusional and turning into a monstrosity was on another level. \n\nDid you ever explore her feelings about these things before? Or did she ever give any indication she didn\u2019t agree with someone being transgender? If her reaction is this strong then I don\u2019t know if there was ever going to be any way for you to handle this situation that wouldn\u2019t set her off short of also rejecting your son. \n\nI\u2019d give her some space to process but if she really can\u2019t see past this to support your son then I would probably go forward with the divorce idea.", "NTA I'm glad you are there for your son and supporting him on his journey. He's 20 I think he can have a decision on how he wants his hair. As well as being an adult he can make his own decisions in his life in general. I'm sorry that your marriage is falling apart but if anyone is being a monster it's his mother. I understand how hard it can be but his transition isn't about her but how he feels. Instead of empathizing and wanting her son to be happy she's just being transphobic. I wish you and your son all the best.", "NTA. You have your priorities straight.", "NTA whatsoever. \n\nOnce your son's mother reads all the studies about how gender affirming support reduces your son's risk of *suicide* she won't be so worried about pronouns and haircuts. Good lord!", "NTA. It's just a haircut. Cis women get buzz cuts, too. Hair grows, it's all temporary. \n\nListening to your kid with your full attention and heart, that's permanent.", "NTA. Your son trusted you enough to confide and tell you how he wants to continue his life which means he\u2019ll be happy doing and being who he wants to be. You supported that and also did/are doing your best to understand him. \n\nThat means A LOT because some parents may have hard times connecting with things and would rather not deal with it, unfortunately. \n\nAs for mom, based on her reaction, I\u2019m not surprised your son doesn\u2019t divulge into his life and choices with her if it\u2019s causing nothing but backlash and judgmental behavior. So, it\u2019s probably a good idea you don\u2019t tell your son about her outrageous reaction. He\u2019s had enough of that and deserves to be treated like a person.", "you are an amazing father. i'm sure that your son is grateful for your support. if anyone is TA here it's your wife, you are in no way an AH. if your wife doesn't make an effort to at least broaden her horizons and try to support your son and learn it's completely understandable why you would want to divorce her. you are making a real effort to understand your son and i am sure that he will appreciate that forever. W dad", "NTA you sir are an awesome parent and at the end of the day screw your wife, it's not a bout her it's about your son and how he feels, all you did was listen and helped him feel more comfortable. I would divorce her and take my son with me. Also have my award you deserve it and  just keep being there, listening, talking and being the awesome dad that you are. Hope your son is OK", "NTA good on you for supporting your child in feeling right in his skin. You're a good Dad.\n\nI hope your wife's reaction is simply grieving the life she was expecting with her child, and that she'll eventually come around to loving and supporting the man your son is becoming.", "NTA. You sound like an amazing dad. Your son is very lucky to have you. I would\u2019ve already served up the divorce papers to wife if I was you.", "Nta. Thank you for showing your son support. Now you will need to actively defend him from your wife. Or soon to be ex wife if it comes to that. Be the bodyguard he needs right now.", "You are such a good dad. My dad tried to physically fight me when I came out. 100000% NTA.", "If there's an ugly monstrosity, it ain't your son.", "NTA. Your son is an adult. He doesn\u2019t need moms approval to get a haircut. He opened up to you about something that was likely not easy to talk to you about and you responded with support and love. \n\nI think you should have expected your wife\u2019s reaction based on what your son already told you. So maybe you could have had a conversation with your wife. I\u2019m assuming she saw the photos that your son posted and that\u2019s why she was upset when you got back home? So maybe there could have been some conversation first. But in any event - you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your wife\u2019s reaction should have been how you reacted: maybe you don\u2019t totally understand something - but you are trying to, and doing your best to be supportive and loving your child. \n\nCalling your own child an ugly monstrosity?? That\u2019s messed up.", "You\u2019re an amazing dad and anyone would be lucky to have you. Thank you for being there for him! There is no way in any universe that you could be an asshole absolutely not. Your wife might be struggling with it or she straight up is against it either way she needs to sort it out she is by the sounds of it going to lose both her husband and son at once", "Your wife is a massive AH here, don't blame you for considering divorce.", "Family therapy asap.", "1000% NTA. Honestly, you demonstrated the perfect way to react to a child coming out to you as trans. Seriously heartwarming stuff. Your wife on the other hand is the AH. You were both surprised and confused by this news. Look at how differently you two are reacting. You put your shock and confusion aside to support your child and learn, while your wife opted for rejection. Plus, your son is an adult; he can look and be anyway he wants to. Maybe you can help your wife cope with this. I wish you luck.", "Omg NO! Big NTA. You did the right thing. Your son is 20. He knows who he is. Your wife doesn\u2019t get to dictate his life as an adult. Maybe if he was 12 then it could have been a more gradual transition with therapy etc, but at 20 he was obviously ready. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "Sir! No! You are so very NTA! Do not doubt it. That's how you are supposed to react to your kid coming out as trans. You did good. Your son is a lucky man to have you for a father. Warms my heart.", "You are absolutely NTA. The fact that your son knew he could come to you about this says so much about what kind of a parent you are. Good on you for doing your best to understand what he\u2019s going through and doing some of your own research so that he does not feel alone in his journey of self-discovery. I\u2019d suggest a serious talk with your wife in which you try to find out why she\u2019s feeling how she\u2019s feeling, but I\u2019d also like to say that you should *not* ask your son to make concessions to her, of any kind. He is who he is. Your wife\u2019s feelings cannot change that, and if her feeling do not change at all and she cannot pull herself together enough to remember that your son is still her child then divorce may end up being an option. Keep your son safe and make sure he feels seen and listened to throughout this process. Good luck to the both of you and again, you\u2019re doing a great job.", "NTA at all!

It's extremely telling that one parent was able to handle this situation with a calm, mature discussion and yet the other *immediately* resorted to screaming and throwing insults.", "I want to say that this random internet stranger is really proud of you (and your son). It can be hard to have something like your view of someone\u2019s gender challenged  and instead of digging your heels in, you recognised you weren\u2019t equipped enough to understand, took steps to help yourself understand all while affirming your sons gender.  When it comes to your wife, I think the key question is \u2018if she can only love your son when he fits her idea of who he is, does she really love your son?\u2019 And if she can\u2019t accept him and you stay with her, realise that to your son, you\u2019re tacitly agreeing with her good luck", "Hugs for you and your son.

Trying to support your kid while your spouse says such hateful things? I can't imagine. It would be an automatic deal breaker for me.

You and your son need to start reading up on hormone therapy and transgender psychology so maybe you can help your wife understand better that your son is not delusional!!
