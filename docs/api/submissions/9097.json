There\u2019s probably a good chance he had no clue that he was giving you awful presents.", "NTA. Though if you haven\u2019t, having a talk with him about him being not great at gift buying would probably be wise.", "NTA. Return the favour and gift him stuff only for the kids. See how quickly he changes his tune then", "NTA, but can I make a suggestion as an alternative - discuss with him buying an experience for you both.\n\nMy wife and I haven't bought each other Christmas gifts in a decade and instead, buy a night away in a nice hotel where we can have a nice meal and a romantic evening together away from.the kids. Perhaps an alternative like this might suit you both?\n\nException to the No-Gifts was 2020 when it seemed likely that we wouldn't actually be able to get away anywhere so we  bought each other things we specifically wanted (I got a record player, and she got jewellery and a fitbit)", "NTA at all and honestly to me it\u2019d be liberating to focus on my own gifts on gift giving occasions like say it\u2019s your birthday, go out and get yourself some gifts you\u2019ve been looking forward to. On Christmas get yourself some gifts you\u2019d be happy to open. Just because your husband sucks at gift giving doesn\u2019t mean you need to be stuck with shitty gifts.

To add insult injury they're appliances he wants and I've told him I do not want because we don't have room for them. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI finally lost it on him this year. It's just better not to try than to do something like that.", "NTA. I feel you. I try so hard to find the perfect gift for my husband and he never tries. He will buy a card (probably day of holiday) and write a note inside telling me to take a spa day or w a picture of something I wanted and he was too lazy to order. I have never once redeemed these gifts bc it hurts my feelings. This year at Thanksgiving his entire family was discussing gift lists and what they get their spouses. Someone asked me and I straight up said in front of everyone he never buys me Christmas gifts.  Ever.  And our kid now askes why mom never gets anything. He was mortified. Then I said I'm not getting you anything this year so you see how I feel. Cue Christmas and he went to his stocking and empty.  Not a single thing for him.  He handed me my stocking and for 2 seconds I felt bad. Then sure enough there was a card w a picture of earbuds I wanted that he waited too long to order. I haven't ordered them and won't, bc I'm still hurt that he can't care enough to order one thing on time for Christmas. Crazy thing is he hasn't even noticed I'm still using my over ear old ones. Sorry for the rant.  Good luck.", "YTA. But not for what you think. It sounds like you receive love by thoughtful presents and he doesn't. You have different love language and you cutting this off will cause problems in the future. You deserve to feel loved in your relationship.\n\nCommunicate and let him know this wasn't okay. Then work towards a solution so this doesn't fester and ruin your relationship. Maybe he needs someone else to help buy the gift. Maybe he has to buy something off the list. But work together instead of cutting it out of your relationship.", "YWBTA talk to him about your feelings and make sure he understands. He might think he's being practical or funny but he's not. I'll be honest i came here expecting to lay into you from the title thinking he gave you gifts that were \"too cheap\" or what not but this is different and my judgement is a very soft ywbta not a firm one.", "YTA you shouldn't be giving to receive.

Your expectations vs his. Best of luck!", "Just buy 2 or 3 nice things, including a good one. Hand them over and he'll be relieved that bday, mothers day, anniversary are all set and that you'll like it.  \nDon't take it too personally.  They can't be good at everything.  \nOccasionally if we're out and I spot something,  I just mention it as a put away gift and they're good with it.  Try it sometime.", "I bought myself one of the pairs of rain boots I sent him and fan girled out over them when I got them.", "A year or two ago I did talk to him about it. I straight up told him that a gift for the kids is not a gift for me. This was after the Christmas of me getting taco holders because the we would all enjoy them (then a couple of days later, they were used and the kids and him had them, but there wasn't enough for myself). Meanwhile that year he got his friend a really nice and thoughtful present, so I know it's possible. He claimed then that he didn't know what to get me. I started sending him links to things after that. It's obviously still happening.", "I think this is a great idea, definitely time for OP and husband to have a real and honest conversation about this. The thing that concerns me is how insulting the gifts are (half being for the kids is bad enough as is). He is limiting OPs identity to only motherhood, and while that\u2019s obviously incredibly important OP is also a fully actualized person with their own interests and wants. The fact that OP was specifically telling the husband what they want and still getting bad gifts\u2026. That\u2019s a terrible look for the husband. Time to consider therapy and potentially throwing the whole husband away.", "Thanks, I do love the idea of the experience gift. Funny thing was that was on my list to him. I may have to push that option for the two of us.", "This, if not OP should talk about it. However I have heard several times from mums that after having kids they get gifts for the kids. So OP should already pit her foot down on those too.", "A couple of years ago I told him after a particularly bad year of gift giving that resulted in the kids and him using the gift for me, and myself not getting a chance (three dino taco holders when there were four of us, as I was getting the kids ready, he got his and used the last one). I told him them and it was decided that I send him a list. I sent him links to three options for one item(so he could still surprise me), and the link for the tickets, etc. Don't even know if he checked them out.", "My links were \"here are three rainboot options for you to choose from for me, here's this other item, etc.\" Do you consider that hinting? Now I am second guessing myself. I thought I was being direct. Also, clapping while saying \"I want tickets to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway next year\" for a month at him. Thought a nice date night would be perfect.", "I am laughing right now. The biggest thing I asked for and what I wanted the most was to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway. I sent him the link, and actually clapped after every word \"I want to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway next year\" at him probably about ten times in late November and December. I loved the idea of a date night (we love close and it's not a crazy amount for us). I thought an experience for just the two of us would be perfect. Great minds there.", "Thanks. We did have this conversation a few years ago and that's when the idea of lists came in. It kind of worked depending on the holiday, but now he's apparently just ignoring it. You're right though, it's not the value. One of the items on my list was chapstick for my stocking so I wasn't the only one with nothing in my stocking again (that I did plan ahead for and threw a candy cane in), so it's the thought about me, not the price. Sounds like talking to him again is in order.", "Thanks, the sad thing is we talked a few years ago about this issue. That's when it was decided that I would send him links to what I would like. I think part 2 of that conversation is in order.", "That's a great idea. I can try it. He wasn't a fan of single item lists when we talked before because he doesn't like me knowing exactly what I will get, which is why my list had some options for most things on it. I may just have to do it myself.", "So he can give good thoughtful gifts, he just doesn\u2019t care about doing it to you. He\u2019s basically saying he doesn\u2019t give a shit about you or your feelings, unfortunately.\n\nStop buying him nice things, get him stuff for the kids. If he can do it to you, why can\u2019t you do it to him?", "He's showing you everything you need to know.  OP are you paying attention?", "Maybe a refresher course in that regard sounds appropriate. Blokes are often hopeless buying gifts for significant others. Good luck Jenzebel1"]}
