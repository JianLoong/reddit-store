Liking gifts does not make me materialistic or a bad person. \n\n2) gifts aren\u2019t a \u201ccheck the box\u201d kind of thing. For a gift to be good it needs to show that he both understands me and thinks about me. It should be something that I would truly desire but not feel ok about splurging on for myself. To help with this I encourage him to keep a note in his phone and every time I mention something I would like throughout the whole year he adds it to the list (sometimes with my prompting) so that when it comes time to buy the gift he has a list of good ideas.\n\n3) procrastination is the enemy of good gifting. I got him to set reminders in his phone a month before Christmas and birthdays. \n\n4) if you complain about how stressful it is to have to buy me a gift, any goodwill you earned by getting the gift is immediately negated by making me feel guilty for wanting to be given a thoughtful gift. \n\n5) thoughtful gift giving is a SKILL that takes time and energy. Women are often taught this skill by their mothers while men are not taught it. You have to go out of your way to learn it if you weren\u2019t taught how to as a child. \n\nNow.

Unfortunately, some people are lazy and do not like shopping at several different websites. It also seems like he got you something he thought you needed (the tray for microwave), not things you wanted. He might be the type of guy that likes to gift a solution to a problem. I do agree with everyone else that the book was in poor taste and he probably didn't think clearly on how you might feel about it. I do hope you both find a solution.", "NTA, I never liked the idea of giving presents to adults.", "YTA because you would be doing yourself a massive disservice if you stop the gift giving. Buy gifts for yourself. Happy birthday hubby, here is a new dress. I thought that you would enjoy watching me wear it.", "NTA putting gift money towards a vacation is a great idea, but I would make sure that he knows it\u2019s because his gifts are so thoughtless and hurtful", "She gave him a, wish list with rain boots and a few other things she wanted and he ignored it", "Thank you so much. I'm debating showing him this so he can see it's not just me thinking this. It may be the wakeup call he or I need.", "I think we are siblings. You just exactly explained how my mind works and I even have a list on my phone for everyone when I get an idea. He would 100% make fun of me in a playful way for this, but I am definitely showing him this. He has compared me to Leslie knope before with gifts and binders, etc. This is perfect.", "So fun story: I bought myself one of the things on my list. I made a big production of getting them (rainboots), trying them on and showing how cute they were. Posted how I finally found the energy to treat myself to something just for me. Got good traction with our friends. It may have sunk in, but I am not sure.", "A friend got me this book when I had PNA. It was a cute gift, but certainly not appropriate unless you have that kind of mindset. I'd go the petty route though, and buy him only things for the  kids or like innaproptrate gifts. Be petty af!", "In that case if you've already talked YWNBTA", "Screw birthday, valentine's day is coming up!", "I agree. My husband is like this too. We have been together for 20+ years. It doesn't get better, it only gets worse. You should think hard about how much you are willing to put up with and deal with. NTA", "Ha, at the time, four. He got three.", "That's pretty sexist of you tbh. Men can be totally adequate gift givers; not holding them to task just bc of their gender and allowing them to be inconsiderate assholes is gross.", "This has to be a fucking joke. He\u2019s deliberately mean to you and for some reason enjoys insulting you.", "Counselor was terrible i see why you stopped", "He wasn't at all like this. When we were dating he got me a huge chocolate bar, like 5 or 10 lbs of good chocolate (he hates chocolate and I love it). That was 100% a gift for me. Things started going downhill after the first kid.", "No I\u2019m not talking about just gifts. Did this man actually care for you?", "Yes. It comes through daily at different times. Either that or I still have the ability to make him smile like that.", "I don't buy things for husband anymore and I didn't tell him I was stopping, I just did it. He's never been good at gifting even when given a list of things to choose from he'd go off list and screw it up. I just buy myself my presents now and he doesn't get presents, he's welcome to buy his own. I spent many wasted years on awesome gifting for him.\n\nNTA tell him he can buy his own things from here on out and also you won't be putting his name on gifts for the kids unless he's actively involved in them. Husband's don't deserve to just show up Christmas morning and be just as surprised with what the kids are getting as they are!", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was a long con of his to get this result. This is over the top weaponized incompetence. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s too cheap and lazy to use your list so he ignores it and buys the cheapest, easiest thing. \n\nGo ahead and buy some of that stuff for yourself since he refuses. And give him crappy gifts like a child\u2019s bike helmet and a book about lousy gift givers", "I solved this by buying myself something I liked, showing him what he got me and then thanking him for it. Win-win.", "It\u2019s about the gifts, but not about the gifts.  He\u2019s showing you he doesn\u2019t care about you.  He has no respect for you.  Is this really how you want to live?  Life is short.  Don\u2019t waste with someone who refuses to be a true partner.  Find someone who loves you and treats you well.", "For Valentine\u2019s Day buy him something you want\nEdit NTA", "NTA my mom had this problem, stepdad gave her a blender and she cried because it didn't feel personal, it was a gift for the house and prior years she had gotten similar appliances. I told her she should use it in her room and not share. She ended up loving using the blender to make smoothies, but he doesn't get to use it, and I don't use it out of respect that she wanted a gift just for her. That worked out, but I think for this you just need to suspend gift giving or make it money only.", "Better, tell him you will get your own gift as he has no clue what a gift is.", "Buy yourself a really nice gift. Somthing you\u2019d love. Have it wrapped beautifully and addressed to you.\nGet a box big enough for the wrapped gift. Put the gift in the box, wrap the box and put your husbands name on it.\n\nWhen he opens the box. Take the gift and thank him profusely. \nA full day at the spa for you, and a hand written note declaring he will be minding the children for a weekend while you are pampered should be appropriate. \n\nSince the best gift (according to him) is clearly a gift to someone else. And since your gifts are for the kids or the family as a whole, his must be meant for you.\nHe won\u2019t have a problem with it /s\n\nNTA - your husband is being an AH. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s a bad gift giver, he just doesn\u2019t value you, but needs you to be craving his approval.\n\nIf he was simply a bad gift giver, he would have selected one of the many things you explicitly asked for. Not doing so and sending you a bad mom book, and a microwave plate is cruel and him playing mind games.", "OP I really need you to understand that your husband isn't stupid, he knows exactly what he's doing. Don't be a doormat. At the very least you should stop spending your money on him.", "NTA. But yourself a gift!", "I\u2019ve always hated the mentality around gifts that you should just be happy you got anything. If my partner gave me a material reminder that they didn\u2019t listen to me or care, I\u2019d be really hurt and upset.\n\nYWNBTA. Use his gift money to get yourself the things you want instead.", "Info: Does he hate you or is it just indifference? He doesn't seem to know or understand the person he's living with.", "I\u2019m sorry your dealing with someone who won\u2019t put in the effort you will, it\u2019s not a money thing it\u2019s a he doesn\u2019t care thing. I would let him know it\u2019s not acceptable and it goes beyond being bad gifts, and too him being a bad partner. He can do it right this Valentine\u2019s Day if he doesn\u2019t after your talk. I suggest an exit plan.", "I've never understood partners making \"jokes\" at the expense of the people they're supposed to love.", "The only way out is through. He bought you a tray for the microwave? He gets a cover. He buys a book about bad moms, you buy him a book about bad dads. He gets bottle warmers and diaper pads. Call his bluff.", "Wait, so they used your gift to make a meal that didn\u2019t even include enough for you??? \n\nOP, my dear friend, please consider that not only do you deserve better, you might also want to think about what your kids are learning from this pattern of behaviour. If you have boys, they\u2019re learning that it\u2019s okay to treat their partner like shit. If you have girls, they\u2019re learning that it\u2019s okay for their partners to treat them like shit. \n\nI\u2019d be really thinking if those are the lessons you want your kids to be growing up with.", "Has he ever prioritized you or does he always just use stuff for you as an extension of stuff for himself? What does he do that makes it worth being married to this man?", "I hate to say this but something is very wrong either with your husband or your marriage.  He got his FRIEND a nice and thoughtful present, which 100% is disrespectful to you as well as a slap in the face. I don't think that the conversation you need to have is about presents...\nYou know him better than I do, but if it were me, I'd dive as deep as possible to find out what was really going on. \nI was married to the AH of the century, but he still got me presents that I wanted. \nI think that you have your work cut out for you, especially if he used to give you nice gifts...\n\nNTA", "Valentine\u2019s Day is right around the corner, why wait for his birthday?", "Oh my god that made me laugh \ud83d\ude02", "There was enough food. There were dino holders that hold the tacos upright. There were only three of those, so mine ended up just on the table. Those ended up in the garbage after.", "To be honest, this is not about you suggesting good or bad things. What he really is communicating you're not worth the effort. \n\nNTA", "My husband made a list of random things I mention I want throughout the year on his phone and surprises me with them. It's not hard, it's not HIM getting the gift, so what that he thinks they're stupid ideas YOU think they're good gifts", "Okay so your husband does not make gift giving a priority, or even close to it. The question is, does he make *you* a priority in other ways? \n\nMy husband and I don't do much in the way of gifts, but we've talked about it and we're not hurting each other's feelings. So I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with skipping gift giving if it's handled well.", "My husband is generally pretty unimaginative with gift giving (although he has had the occasional flash of brilliance). He, in turn, tends to be pretty critical of what I get him (it's not EXACTLY the right model...) or never wears it, or whatever. So our solution now is to unsentimentally just buy whatever we want together and then toss them under the tree (or not), or give each other \"coupons\" (for a thing, a trip, or whatever). Boring? Maybe. But we get what we like and want, and we both get to use our respective gifts! NTA.", "I dunno the first 25 years of marriage he only bought me stuff I picked out myself.  Which was ok because it was stuff I wanted.  These last 5 years? I give him ideas and don't go with him shopping.  I think this last year's gifts were some of the best: 3 new PJs (soft and warm) and 3 pairs of cute socks.   Yeah, he also bought me some rings and a toaster oven/air fryer but the former was a combo XMas and anniversary gift while the latter is more of a family gift. But the socks and PJs? Yeah, made my heart melt all over again.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in this, OP. And it\u2019s not petty, so don\u2019t let anybody dismiss or belittle you by telling you it is. I\u2019d be so hurt. \n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t like gift cards either, but my husband does. When he specifically asks for a gift card, that\u2019s what I get him! Because his gift is about what HE wants, not about what **I** want.", "Nothing more personal than a microwave dish, apparently\u2026", "Or you can give him pull ups for his next birthday...act like a toddler...", "Ah okay. Well, that doesn\u2019t really change my point, unfortunately.", "Speaking generally as a man.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see how husband could be an awesome partner in other respects if this is his attitude about gifts. OP should think about whether she is ok being in a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t care about how she feels and who makes no effort to make her smile.", "I think you\u2019re right, but it\u2019s so depressing that you are. In the age of online wish lists, nobody has ANY valid excuse for being a bad gift giver. Nobody. Because it\u2019s as simple as, \u201cHere is my wishlist\u201d and \u201cOkay! Great, I\u2019ve bought 3 things from the wishlist and *know* she\u2019ll like those.\u201d Many places will even do the wrapping for you, for god\u2019s sake. \n\nEven my 70 year old father-in-law, who routinely posts private messages to his public wall on Facebook because he can\u2019t figure out how to use the website, has managed to master the art of overcoming his bad gift giving skills by asking everyone for a wish list instead. ALL you have to remember to do is order the stuff, and if you struggle with that (as I do), that is why God invented phone calendars with pop up notification reminders. \n\nThere is just absolutely no excuse. OP\u2019s husband just plain doesn\u2019t care *at best*; at worst, he\u2019s being a jerk to her on purpose. Either way, her situation is just\u2026sad.", "To be on par with his gifts she should give him something for the kids and a toilet bowl brush (or something equivalent for around the house). Maybe even get him a pair of silly cartoonish underwear in a size too small, since he\u2019s obviously not a man yet.", "I\u2019m so angry on OP\u2019s behalf. Come on. Nobody is THAT clueless and incompetent. He\u2019s doing this on purpose to be mean.", "Hold yourself to a higher standard. Don't weaponize your incompetence. If giving appropriate gifts is a struggle for you, go out of your way to fix that, don't just shrug and go \"oops uwu\" and continue to give shitty gifts.", "Sounds to me like the parents are the entitled ones and you're just projecting either bad parenting habits or childhood bitterness at not doing the same thing onto me tbh.\n\nPeople do get me things I like now, and everyone is happy, and I am genuinely grateful for those gifts, instead of the performative gratefulness you're encouraging me to perform.\n\nEdit: Also, you don't get to talk about a lack of consideration for other people when you blatantly discard what a child actually wants vs what you want them to have. This is extremely selfish behavior.", "Lol, okay.", "Have you ever had to provide for a family? There\u2019s such a thing as wants vs needs and sometimes choices need to be made when you are the person paying the bills.  Most parents want to indulge their kids\u2019 wants but have to prioritize their needs.  And some parents indulge their kids\u2019 wants too much and create entitled little beasts who grow into entitled adults who don\u2019t see the value in appreciation, compassion or even just realizing they aren\u2019t the star on everyone else\u2019s stage.  \n\nWe aren\u2019t going to agree on this.", "Two things:\n\n1. As sad as it is when someone used to be really kind and great, you have to focus on how they treat you NOW, not how they treated you 10 years ago.   \n2. It\u2019s very common for men to become abusive or neglectful, or just plain stop trying, after they figure they\u2019ve got you \u201clocked down\u201d. This often occurs after marriage or after the birth of a child. In other words, they figure you\u2019re stuck now and can\u2019t/won\u2019t leave, so they don\u2019t have to bother keeping up the pretence of caring about you anymore.", "Sounds like he just wanted kids, not a wife and family.", "Then don't give your kid a thing they need and frame it as a gift. Definitely don't pretend that it's something they should be grateful for. Entitlement goes both ways.", "So a kid should unwrap nothing at Christmas and the next day the parents should hand them the new shoes they need because they outgrew their old ones?  People who grew up or raised a family hand to mouth know this firsthand.  But most kids love their parents and appreciate that they are doing their best and trying. \n\nI promise you there is nothing entitled about providing for a child, particularly a greedy or ungrateful one.  Entitled would be demanding exactly what you want and having a tantrum until you get it like Veruca Salt.\n\nI want an oompah loompah, Daddy, and I want one right now!!!"]}
