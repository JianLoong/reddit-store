And of course the bigger picture might be scary ie. you realize your husband doesn't really care about you (just a hypothetical) or maybe you realize you're really tired of putting in more work than a person who should be matching your pace. All in all everyone isn't good at everything some people are bad at math, some people can't sing and some people are terrible gift givers.

Depending on what he gives you, bring out the appropriate set for him.  If he gives you crap, give him the crap set. Act like nothing is amiss.

I did it exactly this half a year ago, finally. I was sending him the exact link until then, and he would buy one thing, but without ever going the extra mile and always fearing he was doing wrong, without enthusiasm you know. I was let down each time, he was having a hard time each time and let's be honest, it's one of its few flaws: he's bad, bad, bad at gifts giving.\n\nBut he does all laundry, taxes, finds a good restaurant to go out, think about what we could do next school holidays, cleans the whole house on Saturday morning.\n\nSo you know what? I will be better off without gifts and let downs, we can still gift each other randomly during the year if we feel like but no expectations whatsoever for Christmas and birthday and it's soooo liberating!\n\nGifts are meant to cheer you up, if this is not the case find another way to tell each other how much you are important.", "NTA, my wife and I also don\u2019t give each other presents.

Mine isn\u2019t an ass generally but he is a horrible gift giver. After years of thoughtless gifts (many of which he pretended were for me but kept for himself) or insulting gifts (a meal plan subscription of food I can\u2019t eat, given to me because I didn\u2019t have dinner ready when he wanted it), one year literally a dustpan\u2026 Then he started exchanging gifts my parents got for our family, without asking me.\n\n\u2026  I started buying my own gifts.

I feel your pain. My ex bought \"me\" a waffle maker for Christmas because he liked waffles.  He wanted me to make them because he realized using=cleaning, and that sucked.  The next Christmas I got the greatest hits of some shitty band he liked.  I sold both in the yard sale I had shortly before I left him.", "I think some people are going too far implying that you shouldn\u2019t be with your husband over this. If it\u2019s the book I think it is, people often recommend this for moms postpartum. \n\nMy dad is the absolute worst gift giver. One year, he gave my mom a toothbrush. (Just a regular toothbrush, not even electric.) Another year, he gave her a leaf blower so she \u201ccould do more yard work\u201d. Yet another year, he gifted her singing lessons. He apparently got these ideas because my mom said she needed a new toothbrush, wanted something to make yard work easier on her back, and that she wished she could sing better. \n\nMy dad is fabulous in every other way. We all try to help him out now, and I send him things around my mom\u2019s birthday and their anniversary saying, GET ONE OF THESE.

I'm sorry if that is harsh, but you gave him more than enough in ideas and he ignored every single one of them. Why does he feel like he knows more about what you want than you? Why is he acting like now your whole being is just being a mom? Why isn't he treating you like an individual?\n\nThis is bigger than just gift giving, girl. NTA, but take time to reflect on this relationship.", "NTA, you should talk about it. My husband is difficult to buy for never gives me ideas. So instead we set a budget and buy gifts for ourselves. It\u2019s not a surprise Christmas morning but it makes me happier to get exactly what I want. He likes it because the pressure is off him to figure something out.", "My husband used to be a terrible gift giver. For example a politicians autobiography because I read books and Back to the Future boxset because I mentioned I hadn't seen the third movie. Another time it was a military style jumper because it was designer. He was trying to get something I would like and failing. We resolved it by me giving him a wish list. Over the years he has got better and now he gets me stuff off the list as well. \n\nI say this because this is what it looks like when someone loves you and genuinely wants you to have something you like. They get it wrong, but they are trying. \n\nYour husband is not trying. He isn't giving you a single thought and is just getting you a token present for Christmas. The sort of thing you would do if you got a colleague you don't care for in the secret santa draw.\n\nIf he's remorseful,  go for the wish list so he can learn to do better. I wouldn't stop buying gifts for each other as that's sad. Getting a thoughtful gift is very special and you shouldn't miss out.

Sounds like maybe Phantom of the Opera? It doesn't seem to me like you were dropping hints. You were pretty direct about what you wanted. I've gotten theatre tickets the past two Christmases as gifts and all it took was me forwarding the link one time. Last year I got to see \"Tick, Tick, ... boom!\" by Johnathon Larson and this spring we're seeing \"Whose Live Anyway?\" *Please* get yourself tickets to phantom. A microwave tray and a book about horrible moms was just in poor taste.", "If your husband was just a bad gift giver, there would be lots of options. Having a shopping day together where you each pick things out and buy them, ending gift giving, taking a trip together, etc. But he\u2019s not a bad gift giver. He gives thoughtful gifts- to other people. He is telling you over and over with his actions that he does not value you. He may try to explain it away, but the long and short is that you have fully communicated with him how this makes you feel, he continues to do it, and it\u2019s not the only way he shows his lack of interest in your feelings in your marriage.
