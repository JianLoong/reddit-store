He will buy a card (probably day of holiday) and write a note inside telling me to take a spa day or w a picture of something I wanted and he was too lazy to order. I have never once redeemed these gifts bc it hurts my feelings. This year at Thanksgiving his entire family was discussing gift lists and what they get their spouses. Someone asked me and I straight up said in front of everyone he never buys me Christmas gifts.  Ever.  And our kid now askes why mom never gets anything. He was mortified. Then I said I'm not getting you anything this year so you see how I feel. Cue Christmas and he went to his stocking and empty.  Not a single thing for him.  He handed me my stocking and for 2 seconds I felt bad. Then sure enough there was a card w a picture of earbuds I wanted that he waited too long to order. I haven't ordered them and won't, bc I'm still hurt that he can't care enough to order one thing on time for Christmas. Crazy thing is he hasn't even noticed I'm still using my over ear old ones. Sorry for the rant.  Good luck.", "YTA. But not for what you think. It sounds like you receive love by thoughtful presents and he doesn't. You have different love language and you cutting this off will cause problems in the future. You deserve to feel loved in your relationship.\n\nCommunicate and let him know this wasn't okay. Then work towards a solution so this doesn't fester and ruin your relationship. Maybe he needs someone else to help buy the gift. Maybe he has to buy something off the list.

I straight up told him that a gift for the kids is not a gift for me. This was after the Christmas of me getting taco holders because the we would all enjoy them (then a couple of days later, they were used and the kids and him had them, but there wasn't enough for myself). Meanwhile that year he got his friend a really nice and thoughtful present, so I know it's possible. He claimed then that he didn't know what to get me. I started sending him links to things after that. It's obviously still happening.", "I think this is a great idea, definitely time for OP and husband to have a real and honest conversation about this. The thing that concerns me is how insulting the gifts are (half being for the kids is bad enough as is). He is limiting OPs identity to only motherhood, and while that\u2019s obviously incredibly important OP is also a fully actualized person with their own interests and wants. The fact that OP was specifically telling the husband what they want and still getting bad gifts\u2026. That\u2019s a terrible look for the husband. Time to consider therapy and potentially throwing the whole husband away.", "Thanks, I do love the idea of the experience gift. Funny thing was that was on my list to him. I may have to push that option for the two of us.", "This, if not OP should talk about it. However I have heard several times from mums that after having kids they get gifts for the kids. So OP should already pit her foot down on those too.", "A couple of years ago I told him after a particularly bad year of gift giving that resulted in the kids and him using the gift for me, and myself not getting a chance (three dino taco holders when there were four of us, as I was getting the kids ready, he got his and used the last one). I told him them and it was decided that I send him a list. I sent him links to three options for one item(so he could still surprise me), and the link for the tickets, etc. Don't even know if he checked them out.", "My links were \"here are three rainboot options for you to choose from for me, here's this other item, etc.\" Do you consider that hinting? Now I am second guessing myself. I thought I was being direct. Also, clapping while saying \"I want tickets to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway next year\" for a month at him. Thought a nice date night would be perfect.", "I am laughing right now. The biggest thing I asked for and what I wanted the most was to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway. I sent him the link, and actually clapped after every word \"I want to see Phantom before it leaves Broadway next year\" at him probably about ten times in late November and December. I loved the idea of a date night (we love close and it's not a crazy amount for us). I thought an experience for just the two of us would be perfect. Great minds there.", "Thanks. We did have this conversation a few years ago and that's when the idea of lists came in. It kind of worked depending on the holiday, but now he's apparently just ignoring it. You're right though, it's not the value. One of the items on my list was chapstick for my stocking so I wasn't the only one with nothing in my stocking again (that I did plan ahead for and threw a candy cane in), so it's the thought about me, not the price. Sounds like talking to him again is in order.", "Thanks, the sad thing is we talked a few years ago about this issue. That's when it was decided that I would send him links to what I would like. I think part 2 of that conversation is in order.", "That's a great idea. I can try it. He wasn't a fan of single item lists when we talked before because he doesn't like me knowing exactly what I will get, which is why my list had some options for most things on it. I may just have to do it myself.", "So he can give good thoughtful gifts, he just doesn\u2019t care about doing it to you. He\u2019s basically saying he doesn\u2019t give a shit about you or your feelings, unfortunately.\n\nStop buying him nice things, get him stuff for the kids.

Blokes are often hopeless buying gifts for significant others. Good luck Jenzebel1", "NTA My husband and I stopped exchanging gifts a long time ago ( married 40+ yrs) - it's hard picking just the right gift. I'm an avid knitter and I love stuff related to it, but I'm very specific as to what I want, ditto for him. What we have done for years is we give a card or small gift on the holiday/birthday and then make a day just the two of us. We go out to lunch and buy what we want. This works great after Christmas because everything is on clearance, you really get a lot of bang for your buck. And no one has to return anything.", "NTA, especially as you say in the comments that he's able to give thoughtful gifts to others. And you're taking guesswork out by explicitly telling him what you want. My hubs is a terrible gifter, but he knows how to order off an Amazon wishlist. Or to talk to my family members, etc. I mean, your husband could just give you cash and let you buy your own gift if it's soooo hard, but instead he has to get terrible things (the taco holder that only he and the kids could use is just awful, along with the things in the original post)? No more gift may work, but do you think you'd be happy with never getting anything? Could the two of you agree on a dollar amount per event and you buy your own gift?", "Stuff like this is why I no longer take gifts from people.\n\nI'll take money and that's it. I don't turn down handmade items out of courtesy, but I don't like getting gifts I won't enjoy. Too many people got me things they wanted me to have, instead of things I wanted. It took throwing actual powerful fits as a child for 2 Christmases/birthdays in a row to get my family to stop using those days as an excuse to buy me clothes.

They just thought it was cute, and I made it as ugly as possible for them.)\n\nWhen I was a teenager, they started giving me money, and I would show them what I bought for myself and thank them for the gift.

There are some great ideas in this thread and I hope that if you try them they work, but you shouldn't have to crowdsource ideas from strangers to get your husband to show you the same level of consideration he's showing his friends. He's capable of buying thoughtful gifts, you've given him ideas and he's choosing not to.\n\nHe's choosing not to. \n\nIf he was buying awful gifts for everyone, I would be far more on-board with helping him figure out gift giving. We're not born knowing how to do it, not everyone is naturally good at it, no shame in learning! But. He can do it for people who aren't you. I think that's the conversation to have.", "My wife and I stopped trading gifts many years ago. \nWe have one bank account and every income goes to that and every expense comes out of that.  What\u2019s the point of to give and receive gifts?", "NTA, but perhaps you suggest instead of exchanging gifts,the two of you share an experience, ie fancy restaurant, weekend getaway, concert etc.  Maybe even take turns picking the event.", "NTA\n\nhave a proper communication about this issue again, to the core that these \"so called presents\" are not funny at all and are actually hurting not only you but your relationship with these \"presents\", does it not create issues with how you love him if he's being cruel like this? \n\nOr you could go the meaner route, buy him a fucking cruel present and say it's a joke present. \nNonetheless, ynta", "Oh, poor oblivious dumbass, bless his soul. Tell him you'll get him gifts and instead, ask him to put some money aside each month and let you spend it on yourself when it's your b-day. \n\n\nIf he's good at something, tell him to gift you something in that area. If he's good at woodwork, maybe build you something cute/useful each time.... although better useful...cuz from that book I can tell he has the heart for the cute but not the brain for it.", "NTA.", "NTA he will likely be thrilled. Either that or set up a wish list for him to use", "NTA - I realized early on in my relationship that it\u2019s easier for me to get his gifts and my own, then I get exactly what I want. I\u2019m pretty picky and a control freak, so I worked out best for everyone.", "NTA. it may be a reflection on the family dynamic he grew up in. I have heard worse.. one being 3 magazines with the receipt  still inside the bag. Have a  talk with him and go over expectations. ..he may be clueless.", "are you married to MY husband? \ud83e\udd23", "Ugh Im having flashbacks to my ex, who only bought ME gifts for HIMSELF (I got a sleeping bag for Valentine\u2019s Day one year because he liked camping.)\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.

I prefer experiences anyway.", "I think that takes care of the actual gifts, but the problem is she feels unloved and disrespected by her husband. Just getting herself things isn't going to fix that.

I keep wishlists on Steam and Amazon, and people who actually care about me either get me cash or something off one of those.\n\nOP is valid for wanting gifts she actually wants, and it's telling when her partner won't do that for her.", "Ok so let's run an experiment.  For the next gift giving occasion, tell him directly what you want verbally and in writing...be crystal clear.  Tell him multple times but especially weeks and one week before the day.  DO NOT get him any thoughtful gifts.  Then prepare yourself for whatever comes.   \n\nIf he goes the crappy gift route then there's your undeniable proof of what he's been passive-aggressively telling you all along......that he doesn't really care about you and then you'll have to face a truth you've been trying very hard to ignore. If he actually gets what you asked for (which I seriously doubt) then you can use that moment to express how what he does makes you feel.", "THIS \ud83d\udd3c", "Once my kids became teens, I would give them money for xmas and bdays unless there was something specific they wanted.  They definitely preferred it over me trying to come up with gift ideas they may not want.. saves alot of grief."]}
