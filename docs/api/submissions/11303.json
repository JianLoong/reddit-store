For me it's the ordinary ebb and flow of legal practice, and for her it's some overlap between the freelance work she used to do and the full-time job she recently got. But what it comes down to is that we're each working 60-80 hours a week in general.   \n\n\nOur daughter will turn 5 shortly, and we'll be holding a party for her at our place. Based on experience, there's going to be a great deal of panic cleaning to get the house up to the completely spotless standard that's all DW will accept whenever anyone not a member of our immediate family is going to set foot inside. Neither of us is really up to this, but I'm the only one who realizes it.   \n\n\nI raised this with her and proposed all of the following:   \n\\- Hiring a maid service to come and clean up the house. (We can afford this) \n\n\\- Taking some friends up on offers they've made to help with house things.\n\n\\- Paying one friend, who has also offered and who is in money trouble, to help with the cleanup. \n\n\\- Having her mother or my mother (who will both likely attend the party) help out beforehand, which they'd both be happy to do. \n\n\\- Accepting a lower standard of cleanliness since we're pretty much just inviting 4 and 5 year olds and their parents, all of whom I'd expect to be quite understanding about the state of a house with small children in it. \n\n\\- Holding the party somewhere other than in our house.   \n\n\nShe refused all of these. She said \"we can handle it.\" So I told her that there's no \"we.\" I'm not ready to spend a whole day deep-cleaning our house, and so if she's going to refuse any outside help whatsoever and also insist on her usual high standard for guests, she'll be the one bearing the consequences of that, not me. We have a... well, not exactly a schedule, but a system ... for ordinary household chores, and I'll abide by that, but there's no space in my life right now to undertake this project on top of that. She's furious with me and told me she can't believe I'd punish our little girl and our guests just because I'm mad at her for not accepting any of my suggestions. She said \"is it that important to you to be right?\"   \n\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677770842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g5h8j/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_lift_a_finger_to_get_the/", "score": 621, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it's not \"we\" can handle it ourselves. It's either she cam do it on her own or she can accept outside help. \n\nHonestly though, she's the one punishing y'alls kid.

Also, family or friends might expect you and your wife to be social--have a chat, share a drink, etc.. Or might bring family r friend dynamics into the mix which takes time and energy to deal with.

It's like magic, you don't have to do anything but suddenly the house is clean.", "You know, this reminds me of a Simpson's episode, where Marge gets a promotional voucher for a free professional cleanup.\n\nShe then proceeds to clean up the house with manic detail so when the housekeeping service ladies arrive they will find absolutely nothing to clean (because, according to Marge, they gossip to one another about the levels of messiness they find at customers' houses).\n\n[https://youtu.be/I-ZzYCtMPgA?t=55](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/7c9895b1-56ef-4d33-98dd-9ae62bccca9f)\n\nOP is NTA for proposing several workable suggestions what would solve the problem.", "You can come close to having it all, but you sure can\u2019t do it by yourself and realizing that is is an additional step toward wisdom.", "This is 100% what I would have done too. I\u2019m Autistic and ADHD. Accepting help is more stressful than doing it myself till super early in the morning.", "I understand where OP is coming from and I don\u2019t think he is the AH. I think there should be more understanding of why it\u2019s so hard to accept help.", "Ignore that person. you are NTA. You offered various reasonable alternatives which would benefit you both. I don\u2019t see you wife\u2019s objections to these.\n\nps I am not that persons description of most redditors.", "think the key part there is knowing limits and accepting those limits", "Would a person who really wanted to make his life easier choose to work 80 hours a week like OP and his wife do even though they can afford not to?\n\nI think at least some people work hard to earn a lot of money specifically because they have neuroses associated with money and with spending it.  For example, in most circumstances I feel too guilty to pay someone else to do something I could have done myself, regardless of how much money I have and how unpleasant the task is.  I keep thinking about how much my family needed the money when I was little.", "Indeed. As my partner puts it: if you're lucky, you can reach a point in life where your time is much more scarce than your money. At that point, it's well worth paying people to do things - as a rule, if they do the thing for a living, they're generally better (and faster) at doing said thing than you would be anyway.", "Once, my mom had to take a final early in the morning, so my dad was responsible for getting me to school. I was 6.  He broke a brush trying to untangle my hair and dropped me off at school in pajamas and with half a hairbrush still stuck in my hair.\n\nPeople talked about \"how dare *her mother* send a child to school like that. Can you believe *her*?\"\n\nI'm glad that's changed.  My dad learned to brush my baby sister's hair about 5 years ago.  She was the last of his many kids and was in high school, but he learned.", "She is interpreting (probably subconsciously) OP's suggestions as criticism.", "No, I think that falls under the heading of 'managing the household'. Within this mindset, you may get help from the kids, your partner, etc, but a) what they do is under your direction (you have to request the help, and tell them what to do, and b) the shame and criticism of having a less than spotless household will always fall upon you, not the kids/partner.", "This.  I had a friend that would do house cleaning on the side because it was easy money.  She said they would invariably clean their house ahead of time, and her doing it again was a snap, lol.", "This is basically why I haven't hired a cleaning service.  My mom used to clean houses and definitely talked shit about anyone who had neglected something. Old lady with a bad hip? \"OMG, you wouldn't believe how *disgusting* her baseboards were.  It was like she hadn't cared enough to move her furniture in years! Some people...\"  Later on, she had a cleaning lady, and they'd sit and gossip about my mom's friends' houses that the cleaning lady also worked on.\n\nThe shit talking was nasty.\n\nAnd now my mom thinks I should hire someone to clean my house to give me a break.", "Your sarcasm, particularly given the sincerity and detail provided by OP, is unwarranted. \n\nYou do you, but it's not a good look.", "I've just gotten to that point and after decades of being an incredibly slack house cleaner and often being embarrassed at the state of my home, I now have someone come in every 2 weeks. \n\nThe utter relief and confidence in my home I have now is amazing. I swear I will work hard forever to be able to continue to afford it. \n\nOP, I think there's something deeper going on here. Women are socialised to believe that we have to \"do it all\". Instead of approaching this as a hard-line for you, remind her she's not failing for getting help... she's leveling up and learning to delegate.", "Don't feel guilty or be afraid to spend money for those things! The people out there whose families desperately need money are exactly the ones who need someone like you to be willing to pay for their services. They are the ones working the unpleasent jobs that others don't want to do.\n\nAs long as it is not exploitive and the workers are getting a fair wage their should be no shame in hiring services.", "It\u2019s possible that the person we hire to clean our house every 2 weeks talks shit about the state of my house, but why would I care? Let her say anything she wants, we don\u2019t have friends in common and if her friends think my house is messy it will never affect me in any way", "Man, that sounds really tough. I\u2019m sorry.", "That explains it quite well.\n\nThat method may get the deep cleaning done, but probably spends 2x the time and energy of more methodical plans of attack.\n\nIt does suggest another possible reason why she may be resistant to getting outside help to clean (beyond some of the more obvious ones already touched on elsewhere).\n\nStress from dealing with people who clean in a more focused, complete this task then move on fashion. The ones who can just put those toys aside and will worry about putting them away until after the current task is done.\n\nSometimes cleaning and organizing creates temporary \"messes\". Those temporary messes may not bother the methodical cleaner. They know they need to deal with them, when they'll do it, and put it out of mind until then.\n\nIf those things trigger her into wanting to deal with it immediately, having someone else creating the \"messes\" and not dealing with it now could be stressful, even if subconciously. Wanting to deal with, but not wanting to push the other person aside (especially if its her mom) but its there and crying out for attention.\n\nAfter enough experiences of it that could become a \"I just don't want to have others help me clean\" thought/mindset.", "I aspire to reach that point. \n\nMy friend\u2019s mom always told us \u201cno one is going to make life easy on you. If you can do something to make it easier for yourself, do it and don\u2019t feel bad about it.\u201d", "Yeah I just became kind of nuts (mainly about my kitchen) after living in a place that had a roach infestation for 10 months. I still kind of panic when I see them outside and once when there was one by our door.", "There is no credit. Only blame.\n\nThis is a thing that most women understand implicitly and most men will say they don't understand... until they meet a woman who doesn't pick up after them and then they act confused.", "Me tooo!! I\u2019m autistic and ADHD.", "Same. Like wtf, isn't this how all people clean? Yeah sure, you end up having the contents of 5 drawers scattered across the house, and a bunch of piles at one point or another, but you've gotta trust the process.", "She's absolutely right.", ">so this time husband is expected to have her back.\n\nAs opposed to all the other times, when he's doing chores for her front?", ">Are you projecting something that I'm missing here?\n\nI'm \"projecting\" their second reply. The one in which they explain how this mindset does not in any way prevent them from expecting help from a man. Because he's an \"ally and part of the household\" therefore it's his duty to help his wife uphold her perfect hostess image. Hardly what I'd call \"forced to Cinderella\". Unless you think the husband plays the role of the mice and birds who help her clean in some versions of the story...", "In that case they did also explain that even when the husband helps, any criticism tends to fall solely on her head lol", "I feel the need to let you know that as a mum of 4 if my husband offered to hire a cleaning service to do a deep clean before a party at our house I would probably cry. But in a \u201cI\u2019m so grateful, thank you for seeing me and the hard work that I do\u201d way. And then I would probably repay him with things that aren\u2019t appropriate for polite conversation. As it stands I still get the house deep cleaned before a party but because I tell my husband it\u2019s happening. And I don\u2019t do birthday parties at my house because it isn\u2019t worth the stress and extra cleaning. I will happily pay a facility to do all that for me and just show up with a cake and loot bags. You are very much NTA.\n\nEdit to say I HIRE someone to deep clean. I don\u2019t have the capacity to do that and keep 4 kids alive and happy.", "Do it! I struggled with all the steps to hire a cleaning service for several reasons. Finally one day I got tired of my own rationalizations in my head. When I saw a post on the local resident's page on FB, I told myself I would message one service that was recommended.  Just message them. Then see how it goes. Luckily the lady was super sweet,  had a good offer, told me exactly what needs to be done and what could be done once she saw the house. She now comes in monthly and my life is so much easier! \n\nBite the bullet and make the call or send the message. You don't have to commit right away anyways!", "Very gracious comment, I'm just not quite sure why you think steak dinners and watching action movies together are inappropriate for polite conversation ;-)", "Is *that* what the E stands for?! \ud83d\ude02\n\nwtf \ud83e\udd23\n\n\"Chuck E. Cheese\" sounds exactly like someone who owns a pizza joint for kids. Charles Entertainment Cheese sounds like Esquire should be at the end, he reminds anyone who leaves it off, and he wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near pizza.\n\nFor some reason I cannot stop laughing\n\nNTA OP, maybe check out reservations at places and present her with prices vs. the cost (in personal energy, time, etc)?"]}
