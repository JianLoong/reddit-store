For me it's the ordinary ebb and flow of legal practice, and for her it's some overlap between the freelance work she used to do and the full-time job she recently got. But what it comes down to is that we're each working 60-80 hours a week in general.   \n\n\nOur daughter will turn 5 shortly, and we'll be holding a party for her at our place. Based on experience, there's going to be a great deal of panic cleaning to get the house up to the completely spotless standard that's all DW will accept whenever anyone not a member of our immediate family is going to set foot inside. Neither of us is really up to this, but I'm the only one who realizes it.   \n\n\nI raised this with her and proposed all of the following:   \n\\- Hiring a maid service to come and clean up the house. (We can afford this) \n\n\\- Taking some friends up on offers they've made to help with house things.\n\n\\- Paying one friend, who has also offered and who is in money trouble, to help with the cleanup. \n\n\\- Having her mother or my mother (who will both likely attend the party) help out beforehand, which they'd both be happy to do. \n\n\\- Accepting a lower standard of cleanliness since we're pretty much just inviting 4 and 5 year olds and their parents, all of whom I'd expect to be quite understanding about the state of a house with small children in it. \n\n\\- Holding the party somewhere other than in our house.   \n\n\nShe refused all of these. She said \"we can handle it.\" So I told her that there's no \"we.\" I'm not ready to spend a whole day deep-cleaning our house, and so if she's going to refuse any outside help whatsoever and also insist on her usual high standard for guests, she'll be the one bearing the consequences of that, not me. We have a... well, not exactly a schedule, but a system ... for ordinary household chores, and I'll abide by that, but there's no space in my life right now to undertake this project on top of that. She's furious with me and told me she can't believe I'd punish our little girl and our guests just because I'm mad at her for not accepting any of my suggestions. She said \"is it that important to you to be right?\"   \n\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677770842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g5h8j/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_lift_a_finger_to_get_the/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it's not \"we\" can handle it ourselves. It's either she cam do it on her own or she can accept outside help. \n\nHonestly though, she's the one punishing y'alls kid.

Her own controlling tendencies very likely set up that tacit understanding, but that doesn't mean you have to conform.\n\nThat's a very long way of saying: if you want to hire a cleaner, hire one.
