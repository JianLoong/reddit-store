Why does this need to be an all or nothing, match our devotion or you're terrible type of situation?\n\nStart establishing firm boundaries with these people. Good luck.", "NTA - on vacation, you should feel like you can relax, but it sounds like it would cause issues if you stayed in the house with the rest of your family.", "NTA\n\nYour family (hubby, you, and baby) your rules.\n\nCousin-in-law needs to revise their empathy training. Nitpicking is unnecessary and hurtful.\n\n\"Medical field\" doesn't give them the right to bully you.", "OP, Your top priority is the welfare of your child. Your other top priority is your own welfare, as a responsible parent. Please assert your need for the welfare of your nuclear family. You can always stay later or arrive earlier if you wish to spend more time with family. Your husband can likewise visit earlier or later. You are working and also need time to actually relax on vacation. Give yourself permission to be kind to yourself.", "NTA.  Make sure that husband gets on board with the hotel idea.  There is no reason for you to endure the disrespect and ridicule that family members have shown to you.  If he won't agree then have a relapse and stay home.  Sorry if my comment is too extreme for you.  It's what I think and that's what you asked for.  Be happy.  You deserve it.", "NTA  Your immediate family deserves its privacy, either at home or a hotel.

I wouldn't even call it selfish to want to be able to take a break from them on your vacation.", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL's cousin may mean well, but her constant critiques and safety recommendations are unnecessary and adding to your stress as a new mother. And to hear that she and your MIL were talking about you behind your back is a complete violation of trust. \n\nAs for the vacation, it's understandable that you want to stay in a hotel to have some privacy and space for your family. It's not like you're completely skipping out on spending time with everyone, you're just choosing to have your own accommodations. Your FIL's poor health is concerning, but your mental health and well-being should also be taken into consideration. Your husband may feel torn, but he should also understand your perspective and work with you on a compromise that works for everyone.", "NTA- older people need to start realizing that younger folks can make their own decisions and handle things in ways that work for them. And it is way too intrusive that the cousin even has an opinion on what you do as a parent and they should not be discussing it. It sounds like a super rough time after birth and it is totally ok that you feed your child with a bottle.", "NTA - You have every right in the world to want some distance from your MIL and her obnoxious relation.  Attending the gathering, but having your own space is the best compromise.  Your husband needs to polish up his spine and tell MIL that her buttinski buddy needs to keep her trap shut and her opinions to herself or there are going to be changes coming.  And you should not be shy about shutting down commentary in your presence.  \"Anyone who feels entitled to denigrate my parenting efforts in the face of the struggles and challenges I have had is not someone I have any interest in spending time with, so baby and I will be going back to our place until you learn some manners.\"", "NTA - Begin untangling yourself from your MIL and the aunt. MIL isn\u2019t as kind as you assume. I\u2019ll bet you some of those pesky opinions are actually hers but she uses the aunt as a scapegoat. They are intermingled and they both suck.

Yikes... some of the in-laws sound a bit problematic.", "NTA. Why would FIL poor health require you to stay in the rental home?  No reason you can't get a hotel room, to have your own space to go to when baby needs to nap etc. Space is good ;)", "Ask them what the data is on mothers who are made to feel like shit? \n\nNTA", "NTA. If she truly works in the medical field, what on earth gives her the right to criticize you and call you a lesser-than mother for....... What, agreeing to mutilate your own body in order to give your child the best chance at life, and then contracting a dangerous infection as a result of said sacrifice?? What????? If anything, that makes you so much more of a good mom than if you had decided to try and force vaginal birth to the detriment of your baby.  And if you had to supplement with formula after the fact because of your physical condition, whoop-di-do. What of it? Would she prefer your baby starve while you recover?  As long as you are not actively threatening the safety of your baby, she can keep her mouth shut.  Personally, I'd have no issues directly telling everyone why I'm not willing to share a house with her and anyone who has a problem with it can get over it, but I'm also really not one to shy away from conflict, sooo...... Totally get it if that's not your M.O.  Either way, do not feel guilty for protecting your own peace and sanity regarding your family.", "NAH: (Well except for that \"aunt\"... but I think you need a whole other post on that topic).  \nSeems quite reasonable that for your first family vacation you would like to spend it with just your family... but I also see everyone wanting to be together (hence the reason your husband is torn).\n\nGiven that you're still willing to spend some time with everyone during the day, it seems quite reasonable that you also want to be able to have some private family time together.\n\nThe only other thing I can think to bring up is whether there is a financial NEED for your family to contribute to the cost of this house?  If so, I can see why everyone is pressuring you.
