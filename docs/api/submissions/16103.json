People forget that the siblings of disabled kids are still children themselves, and they should not be expected to be more mature and self sacrificing than any other kid. I know you're legally an adult now, but 19 is still very young. It's ok to be upset about your situation. You haven't even complained about your sister once in this post, just your parents treatment and expectations of you. \n\nAlso, your parents don't get to decide for you that you will be your sisters full time caretaker in your adulthood. It might not even be the best thing for her, if you end up feeling burnt out and resentful. There are alternative options where your sister will still be taken care of, just maybe not identically to how your parents invision it.", "NTA, but your issue is with your parents and not your sister. It's not her fault that she is disabled and she doesn't deserve your resentment. Your parents do. \n\nYou did not choose to have a child, and you are not her parent. Your parents can not expect you to take on such a huge responsibility unless you *want* to. Your sister deserves a caretaker who is fully committed to her care, and if you're not, they need to make other arrangements. \n\nYour parents also need to find a way to balance the needs of all of their children rather than neglecting you and your brother to put all of their energy into your sister. I can only imagine what it is like to parent a special needs child, but they have two other children they chose to bring into the world and who need them.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that your parents expect you and your brother to give up your life to be her carers, makes it clear that you are parentfied.\n\nthey don't see you see their kids, just her carers, and you don't hate your sister. you hate how your parent's actions make you feel about her. you know there is nothing you can do about it\n\nwant some advice, and I'm going to be harsh \n\ngo to college and work your ass off, and get your brother out of there as soon as possible, let him live with you  when he is in college, and go low contact. make it clear, that neither of you will go down this road\n\nmake sure he has his plan in action and ready to go\n\nyou are not heartless, and your parents suck for even consider guilt-tripping you", "Hell no you ain't. That's their child not yours. That's your sister. Love her, help her, but live your life.", "NTA. I think the feelings you are expressing are entirely normal in a situation like that and shouldn\u2019t be deemed as \u201cheartless.\u201d At the end of the day you are entitled to your own life and shouldn\u2019t have to revolve it around your sisters needs, neither should your brother. I think family therapy sessions would be incredibly beneficial for everyone, especially your little brother since he is still so young.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t her parent, and you and your brother deserve to be taken care of and celebrated equally. You have no responsibility to her after they pass, that\u2019s on them to create proper arrangements. The only thing I hope you are able and willing to do is take your brother out sometimes so he can get the attention he deserves too. Best wishes!!", "NTA it's normal to feel resentment what would make that a yes is if you took it out on her or your parents.", "NTA. That's a really difficult situation and of course I couldn't call you an asshole for feeling the way that you do. I work with carers, most of them feel this way at least some of the time. Young carers have it especially tough because it's such a huge responsibility at an age where they need people to look after them and not the other way around.\n\nThe state should have disability services that support people to live independently to their families, that are of good quality and provide disabled people with the best life. But I'm aware that's often not the case in many countries. It leaves families in this horrible predicament where the responsibility falls on them to care, even if they aren't trained or supported to know how to provide care, even if the person they are caring for would prefer to be more independent to their parents or siblings.\n\nAs a starting point I would have a look at what options there are for respite or weekend day programs that could be appropriate for your sister. That way your family could make some one on one time with your brother. I'd also recommend looking into whether there are programs for young carers where you live. Where I live there are some great programs that provide young people in similar situations as your brother with free counseling, group activities and camps. It might be really nice for your brother to meet other young people who are in the same boat. You could also access this sort of support for yourself if you wanted to.\n\n19 is very young to be thinking about providing care to another human being! I think it would be fair if you told your parents, whenever conversations about your sisters future come up; that's really far down the track, none of us can predict what's going to happen in 10 to 20 years time, it really doesn't make sense for us to plan this out now. For now I just need to focus on school and working towards establishing a career. Let's have this conversation when I'm independent enough to live out of home and care for myself, let alone care for my sister.\n\nI'd also give the same advice to you. You dont need to worry about what might happen decades from now. Your thoughts about it may or may not change over time. In a few decades there could be other options for your sister too.", "NTA it\u2019s ok for you to let your parents know that they have to find other options for care for your sister after their death - although, since it just causes an argument, you don\u2019t have to hammer on it now. You can probably wait another 30 years before it becomes important. Don\u2019t base your life around her care.", "NTA. It is very challenging to have a family member with special needs, and all  your  feelings are valid.  Of course you love her but she does require resources and attention and time. I wish you parents would listen to you without judging you. Just remember that they are terrified that something happen to them and she's mistreated because she's vulnerable, and they want family that loves her if they can't be there. They didn't plan this for their family and you know that they have days they feel resentment over the loss of a more average family life. If you haven't , a support group for siblings of special needs children could help you see your feelings are valid and give you a place to vent and to learn how to express yourself to your parents so they understand where you're coming from. It would feel like a daunting future , but it's not likely to happen, so plan for the life you intend", "NTA. They should have made sure that they spent time with and made sure you and your brother were ok.", "NTA. Your parents are the AHs here. They are neglecting you and your brother. Please make sure you are there for your brother when you can because he will probably be the one that will suffer the most from this situation", "No verdict. This is normal and above the subs pay grade. Getting these feelings out to a therapist may help.", "YTA because your sister didn't do anything wrong dude. She's a kid. Come on. Use your head. The person you're really mad at is your parents. Maybe you should try to talk to them and express your feelings and see if you can't work something out?", "No. I have a sibling with similar feelings. It comes with the territory. You want your own life and you want some attention. That's natural. Just work through it. You may not end up with the life you want, but caring for her wouldn't mean that life couldn't be enjoyable. It's a lot funner when lived with others in mind anyhow.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I (19F) get annoyed because since she has been born everything is about her and has affected me and my brother (8M) and im afraid he will become a glass child. obviously I love my sister but I do resent her sometimes not because of her disability but because all of my parents time and energy goes into her to the point that we are never seen or celebrated. Basically everything that they do has to be revolved around her. I am in college and plan on moving out soon but I worry for my brother since all hes ever  known is this life.  The main issue now for me rn is that my parents say that when they die one of us (most likely me) will have to be her primary care taker. i know it sounds selfish but I dont want to have to base my entire life around her needs. Whenever I say this to my parents they say that im heartless. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Resent your parents all you want because this is ABSOLUTELY their fault. She can't help having a disability. You have a right to feel how you feel, but it's just misplaced resentment. You may want to go to therapy to help with this.", "NTA. Your parents should have already done this for you and your brother, but  \u201c[Sibshops](https://siblingsupport.org/sibshops/)\u201d might be of some help. \n\nThey\u2019re a chance to meet other kids with disabled siblings and provide support and a chance to discuss their own feelings.", "NTA - but don't resent your sister, resent your parents. It is their responsibility to plan for her care once they are unable to care for her.\n\nTake care of yourself and look out for your brother. You sound like a good sister.", "NTA. No you\u2019re not the asshole for resenting your disabled sister - it sounds more like you resent the circumstances and not the person honestly; you\u2019re entitled to live your life how you want and shouldn\u2019t have to ideally be put in this situation at all - it\u2019s not a fair one for sure. \n\nIf you\u2019re taking suggestions, you might want to consider hopping onto r/ relationship advice to figure out how to be there for your brother and deal with your relationship with your presents and younger sister. Hope everything turns out well, but I do want to make clear that you as a person aren\u2019t responsible for making sure everything in your family goes smoothly, obviously, but if you do want to make steps towards managing it it might be worths eking more advice \n\nHope that helps some :)", "Low key parentifying her too with this advice...\n\nShe shouldn't have to be her brothers caregiver either.", "But aren't you suggesting here that she should be responsible for her brother? \n\nOP, until you decide to commit to a partner or have children, you are not responsible for another human being unless you choose to be. Take care of yourself first, and then see if you have the means and energy to help anyone else. Good luck!", "Op is NOT an A H for resenting her sister. She sees her as the reason for their parents neglect. Her mark maybe off but her feelings are valid. Her parents are in the wrong. We cannot forget that Op is a child just like the younger brother and they still need their parents. A little empathy will go a long way", "Just accept the life you don't want but yes, work through it. It is funner when lived with others in mind\n \nAlso explain all that to the 8 year old. I'm sure this your sunny disposition will get them through it all", "150% disagree with you. They still need to parent the other 2 children, they chose to bring them into this world. Plenty of other parents with disabled kids make it work, no reason these guys get a free asshole pass.", "Nope. OP\u2019s parents should understand that they chose to have three kids so they have an obligation to give time and attention to each of them.", "you're right OP shouldn't be someone needs to be looking out for the brother since the parents don't seem to care\n\nthere is only a year between the younger siblings, so his entire life would have been taken up with his sister's care, it's harsh. but can you imagine your entire life playing second fiddle to a sister, with needs? it's unfair, and it's unfair that two children may love their sister, but due to the actions of their parents can't help but feel resentment.\n\nend of the day, someone needs to look out for the 8 year old, since the parents clearly don't", "no of couse not, but let's face it. when op goes to college, an 8-year-old will feel isolated with the parents only focusing on one child. you think an 8-year-old, isn't going to struggle with that? \n\nwith that isolated feeling, and parents telling them \"oh when we're gone, you have to be your sister's keeper\" the parents clearly have shown their true colours, but even expecting this, and not working out a plan for the sister, if anything does happen to them whilst ignoring OP's feelings and guilt-tripping them. and a child is further down on the list \n\nthe kids who don't have their parent's affection and attention unless they have to be carers for their daughter, are going to have to be each other's support in all of this. because OP's parents only give the attention to one child \n\nalso op,at some point are you going to send this to your parents", "But directing your anger at an innocent child is AH behavior. It doesn't mean OP is a big mean bully or anything like that. I say this very gently. But in my honest opinion the misplaced anger is not good. Telling someone when their behavior is wrong doesn't mean you lack empathy for them.", "The eight year  old  won't  be  tasked with  her care once the parents  are gone. OP will unless he decides to send her away to a mental institution or similar care facility.", "I agree with you. But neither you and i know if the parents neglect the other kids or not. I understand she feels this way and honestly the parents should do everything to let their other kids feel appreciated as well, but obviously the autistic kid needs more attention", "Yes I'm sure the autistic kid needs more attention, but from reading the article this girl seems to feel invisible and unloved, unimportant. They need to get it together or both the kids will go NC and it will only be their fault. I can't even imagine feeling like your only importance to your parents is someday taking on care for the sibling. And if they had worked to create a more loving environment, maybe older sister would be more into that idea. Clearly they have failed."]}
