Then complains when you do. She hasn't really got a leg to stand on here. \n\nPlus she's being a hypocrite. So she's allowed... alone time but no-one else is? Lol no.\n\nGotta admit your parting shot made me laugh. Probably not a sensible thing to argue over but very justified.", "You offered to get the kid a room? You're the good guy here. Do your thing.", "Dude you\u2019re NTA. You were polite about it and explained you wanted your own room, besides, what 16 year old boy wants to share a room with their uncle for a trip? This boy is probably very thankful that you even paid for it. If she\u2019s gonna be rude, ask for your money back that you spent on her son.", "NTA, why the f is it that if you are single everyone thinks it is your duty to watch their gremlin be it at the pool or share a room with them so the birthers can have free time to themselves.  When I go on vacation it is to relax and not be the nanny.", "So she wanted the kid out of her way so she could have sex with her husband and called you depraved because you said he couldn\u2019t sleep in your room because you wanted to have sex? \n\nHave her look up hypocrisy at some point please?\n\nNTA", "As one of 14 siblings and the only one without kids, NTA. Siblings start thinking we\u2019re built in babysitters, and while I will watch a kid for an emergency, it\u2019s not my job to make arrangements for them on a day to day basis or for a vacation. Were you harsh with your sister? Absolutely. But you were downright Emily Post level considerate when it comes to a brother/sister argument.", "NTA Maybe a little harsh or rash, but all in all you seem to be in the right\nEdit: The last line may have been a bit too far though", "NTA. You do you OP! \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, your sister was out of line pushing her nephew on you. If she thought he needed supervision and accused you of being a lowlife, how could she then be ok with him staying with you for three days. The hypocrisy is strong with her.", "NTA keep being the cool uncle, later on in life when shit goes down he\u2019s gonna come running to you and not them", "NTA. I think you weren't super polite about everything but you don't have to be. You bought the room and you set clear boundaries. I think what you did was okay and if she didn't want  her son to have the room to himself then she should have let her son stay with them. I think you gave him an enjoyable experience anyway. What else are family members for lol", "NTA. She\u2019s not only acting entitled and nasty but you told her what you were going to do and she still wanted her kid around you for her own convenience. She needs to get over herself and accept that she won\u2019t always get time away from her kid and people aren\u2019t ready made babysitters. You even did her and the kid a favor by giving the kid his own space.", "NTAH. You have the right to have your own room, but she can at least ask you for the idea, and of course you can refuse. You were more than gracious in offering his own room but of course they declined. I personally believe family should be able to compromise but I would say that your sister might be an asshole for calling you out with a great compromise. Her kid her problem though in the long run.", "NTA.  But now I'm interested in the \"debauchery \" that took place.  Could we get a list or what?", "She could have gotten him a connecting room. That is exactly why those exist. NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. This cracked me up.", "ETA; but mostly your sister. I completely understand that he\u2019s 16 and probably mature enough to stay in a hotel room by himself. At 16, I know I didn\u2019t need a babysitter. However, your sister asked you if he could stay with you; nothing wrong with asking. You say no; nothing wrong with saying no. Your nephew is not your responsibility. You paid for your room to enjoy. It should\u2019ve been left at that and she shouldn\u2019t have called you disgusting, etc. She sounds pretty entitled at this point. If she wanted alone time with her husband, she could\u2019ve purchase a room joint to hers in advance. \n\nIt was really generous of you to offer to pay for a separate room for your nephew, but because your sister wasn\u2019t comfortable with her son staying alone you shouldn\u2019t have went against this.I understand your sister being upset that you had lied but the name calling is completely immature. Obviously, at the end of the day, your nephew is completely fine and he enjoyed himself.", "Ehhh NTA for not wanting to share a room. \n\nBut! Y T A for being in Ann Arbor.

While it might seem generous that you paid for a separate room for him, if his mom didn\u2019t want him in his own room, you shouldn\u2019t have done that either just declined entirely and stayed out of it.

We could be wrong. Perhaps they met on her 19th birthday, still kinda inappropriate. It's not just the age gap, it's the fact that she was so young"]}
