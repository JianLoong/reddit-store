He fucking lied man.", "[removed]", "What makes you think they sneak \ud83d\ude0f.", "I could see that, for sure. I guess it seemed like OP is \"proud\" or at least doesn't care about being called a dirtbag, so I was expecting him to explain something more scandalous. Could definitely be I just wasn't reading between the lines enough, and if he's using the D.E.N.N.I.S. System, that definitely does make him a dirtbag. Otherwise, though, he's just being a single dude", "That's a neglectful parent who dumps their responsibility on others and hold them responsible for their own actions. She should look into the mirror before opening her mouth.", "You\u2019re assuming a whole lot from literally knowing nothing about these people.", "Pre-kids, I might have been willing to agree to sit for 17 close kids *if I'd been asked beforehand* but simply randomly throwing your children at someone without prior agreement? No. \n\nPost- kids, the idea of shoving my offspring at someone who doesn't expect them and doesn't want them is even more bizarre. If I trust someone enough to leave my kids with them, then I also respect them enough to oh idk, ASK THEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.\n\nYour siblings got off lightly.", "We call it \"craft herpes\" where I'm from.", "You have no idea when they met, and also maybe no idea what grooming means", "It doesn't  say she doesnt have another child who  didnt come.  OP probably watched his sister get pregnant.", "What? How would that make the nephew 26?", "maybe she should\u2019ve done a better job watching her own damn kid \ud83e\udd37", "He did say no, and that's when the mum was mad that her brother wanted to have sex on a vacation. \n\nShe doesn't sound like the sort of person who is reasonable and takes no for an answer.", "trying to pawn your kid off on someone else so that you can fuck on vacation and guilting that person for not wanting to be more responsible than you are on your shared vacation isn\u2019t exactly not harm.. also the kid is 16. you think he isn\u2019t aware that three adults are fighting over who has the right to not be around him the most?", "He told her up front he was paying for a room for the nephew.\n\n\n She was just happy to not have the responsibility of her son and push that responsibility onto her brother.", "And then\u2026?", "And did what with them?", "Bot.", "This is a partial copy/paste of someone else's comment  (not sure how to link).", "Yeah same, I was also expecting something more. Maybe he also grew up in a way where he genuinely internalised that casual sex is a dirtbag move. Who knows", "That's an intro to psych level understanding of neglect", "He lied to her. Is she irresponsible for trusting OP?", "This isn't an assumption lol. The fact that she didn't know her son was sleeping alone in a room shows that she didn't pay attention to him at all. That's not an assumption, that's literally what this means.", "She's not allowed to judge other people when her husband and her own choices are questionable.

That makes them both assholes in my opinion.", "It\u2019s just that you\u2019re going against the popular opinion I guess.

She isn\u2019t pushing anything on him. Just say no. Then say no again! I thought you men were all confident.", "I'm hoping the monsters were loaded with sugar and dumped on the parents on Sunday evening.", "The original comment this bot copied: \n\n> Exaclty. One weekend about five years ago my siblings dumped all, at the time, 17 kids on me. Without asking, with no warning (cause they knew I\u2019d say no) and went out of town together. So on Sunday I loaded the lil monsters up with \u201cGo juice\u201d (Redbull mixed with Mtn Dew) and all but emptied Walmart\u2019s candy aisle. Then I sent them home. They\u2019ve never pulled another stunt like that since.

Good on OP for not letting that dictate his life, was just sad to see he thinks that makes him a dirtbag.\n\nAgain, provided that he doesn't think he has to trick women into sleeping with him, out of a misguided belief that no woman will have sex if she doesn't believe it will lead to commitment. A misconception that is not unthinkable given the views he presumably grew up with, I guess..", "What?", "She is irresponsible for not providing him a room before and deciding that her brother can babysit while she has sex then getting angry because the brother wanted sex too", "So she can abuse op again for saying no?", "She ASKED him to watch the kid. He lied and said he would. If OP didn\u2019t lie presumably the nephew would\u2019ve just stayed with his parents.", "If they both weren\u2019t mega assholes it would just end at no. But they hate each other so much I guess they can\u2019t have normal conversations. So yes she sucks and so does he. ESH", "He said no, I'm having sex. \n\nShe got annoyed because it ruined her sex plans.\n\nHe couldn't be bothered arguing with someone who can't organize her son's own sleeping accomodations properly \n\nShe then didn't check until the last night, because of her plans at night. She didn't want to be a mother that weekend, she was only thinking of her own debauchery"]}
