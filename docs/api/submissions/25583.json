It made for an interesting childhood and definitely gave me a certain sense of humour lol my brothers would rip the shit out of me if I did something like this after being told very specifically not to", "You're buying into the lie told by Big Science that Earth is round /s.\n\nIt's just luck that sis didn't take off her life jacket, stand on the seat waving it to let people know where she was. She was wearing a life jacket. Lie and tell me she was wearing a life jacket.", "Yeah but if OP could still see her that wasn't the case. Also i don't know if a random jet ski excursion like this can go far enough from the shore to hide it or if it's more something that happens to full on ships in the middle of the sea.", "Some of these replies are downright cruel. Why would you *laugh* at someone who is crying and shaking after a scary experience, even if they made a dumb mistake? That\u2019s so mean and I\u2019d never do that to someone. This sub is so vile and toxic.", "It\u2019s the ocean, not a swimming pool. She could have easily drowned or been killed by a shark. If it weren\u2019t for the Coast Guard she could be dead. And you\u2019re sitting there giggling at her ordeal. \n\nThere are stories of people falling off cruise ships and surviving, and their stories sound completely terrifying. \u201cJust float on your back\u201d doesn\u2019t help ease their terror. Being trapped in the open ocean is extremely dangerous and not everyone survives it.\n\nEdit: guy replied to me then blocked me? Lol. Well, I can see your reply anyway if I log out. Here\u2019s my response: \n\nOh yeah I\u2019m being \u201cdramatic\u201d because I\u2019m showing a little sympathy to a young woman who had to be RESCUED BY THE COAST GUARD and almost drowned. Just because you can swim doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe so far out at sea. That\u2019s why even strong swimmers sometimes drown if they\u2019re pulled out too far. How do you live laughing at other people\u2019s expense?", "Now I\u2019m just picturing her on a stupid jet ski zooming out to sea way too fast, in a straight line, super determined look on her face, while everyone is standing on shore like \u201cha ha, look at her go! Oh, boy. That TINA is such a CARD! She\u2019s coming back though, right? Like she\u2019s going to stop now and turn around. Oh. Huh. Look at Tina go\u2026 She\u2019s getting smaller. Wow Tina\u2019s in the ocean. Oh she\u2019s gone.\u201d \ud83d\ude2d", "Not at that distance.", "There should be a sub-Reddit with these comments for easy referral (and stealing)", "And OP said one of the guards just rode the jetski back to shore lol", "Because they didn\u2019t laugh at her when she was cry and shaking. They laughed at her when she tried to regale them with the tale, like it was some epic thing that happened to her when if she had turned her head at any point in the hour waiting for the coast guard, she\u2019d have realised land was right there", "She literally had the jet ski. I\u2019ve been in open water, if you can\u2019t even swim or float, you have no business doing anything in the water without a lifevest. I\u2019m assuming she had one or she knows how to swim. Do you know how slim the chances are of being attacked by a shark? How do you live being this dramatic? Yea I blocked your dramatic ass lmao", "Tide pods are mainly orange. That means they taste like oranges. I ran out of oranges yesterday and I need an orange for breakfast. I only have one pod left, so I guess I can do laundry tomorrow.\n\nI am so getting into Mensa this time.", "Look at the mother. Freaking out, and then coddling her poor little baby. They've been taught that if they just sit down and start crying and screaming that someone will solve their problem.\n  \nI bet this behavior has been the same with her and her mother since she was a baby. She cries, mommy comes to the rescue. Never had to solve her own problems.", "That explains it. Sister is a Sim.", "damn. thank you for sharing", "Me too! My shoulders are shaking and my dog is like bro.", "We cannot know her eyesight, her mindset, the weather conditions, tide direction, local currents or the time of day/direction of sunlight. And at the end of the day, it doesn't actually matter.\n\nThe original point I was making to the second commenter in this thread doesn't hinge on whether or not she could see land. It's the fact she was out of her depth in deep water, couldn't get back to shore, and her relatives couldn't get to her. She was not in a place of safety. \n\nThat doesn't change the fact that she's at fault for the situation and OP should be able to point that out (though I personally would have done that without making a joke out of her foolishness). It just means that there was not \"no danger\" as the first commenter asserted.", "But the people on the shore could see her"]}
