I'm going say NTA.", "NTA. On a completely unrelated note, have you heard of the Darwin awards?", "NTA. Sort of funny if she is an adult. I don't understand why she didnt ride the jetski back to land. Sounds like she doesn't have the best common sense and I'm not trying to poke fun.", "Nta.\nIf you chose to laugh at her for no reason, I'd say you were an asshole. But her trying to pretend as if she didn't almost get herself killed deserves to be laughed at and called out.\n\nI'll never understand why people don't treat oceans, lakes, and boats, with respect. People can and do lose their lives on the ocean all the time, even when they aren't being morons. The water is unforgiving.", "NTA\n\nYour sister got lost due to her own dumbassery. It's funny and she was being incredibly stupid and over dramatic.", "INFO: Is the jet ski okay?\n\nAlso NTA and as a sibling I would be using navigation error for so many things from now on. Perhaps for the holidays you can buy her a nice compass.", "NTA. This is hilarious. If you do something stupid, your siblings are going to laugh at the consequences.\n\nI didn't get \"lost at sea,\" but when I was younger, I was left in the water with my uncles jetski and told to stay with it while he had to go do something. I didn't like the feel of seaweed on my legs, so I sat on it and proceeded to not pay any attention till I heard him calling my name and realized I had floated away. I got towed back by a helpful kayaker. I thought it was way funnier than my uncle did.", "NTA. Oh boy, I\u2019ve always wanted to say this on Reddit: play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that arrogant people with zero skills or common sense are always the ones that get the most upset after they get themselves into trouble because they refused to listen to people who actually know what they\u2019re talking about. Zero sympathy. Hopefully your sister quits the victim act soon and realizes she should just be embarrassed about being such a cocky fool.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister was an irresponsible ass and was lucky she survived. Hopefully a learning experience for her.", "NTA your sister bad decisions almost made her shark food", "NTA. When your siblings screw up it\u2019s funny as long as there\u2019s not real trauma.

It was caused entirely by her making a series of incredibly stupid decisions, and being completely unaware of her surroundings.
