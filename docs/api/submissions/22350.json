My parents had me and my twin brother late (infertility). And they were filthy rich. \n\nOne thing they always made clear was that if they knew one of us was dating men, they would write us out of the will. \n\nI've known I was gay since I was 10, but I didn't want to lose my fat heritage so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nMy brother was the opposite, he decided to come out when he left for college and, sure enough, my parents disgraced him. They literally gave him money to cover all his college expenses until he graduated and they  never spoke to him again. \n\nMaking it clear that at no point I agree with this, but I didn't say anything because I'm simply not on good terms with my brother.\n\n I have autism and ADHD, and so I have a lot of difficulties, unlike my brother who was the brightest of the family (my parents' words). This directly impacted the relationship between me and him, because I was the \"defective\" son that my parents could not return to the factory and my brother always abused that. \n\nAfter my brother came out, I became the favorite son and even dated some women at the time to take the pressure off. \n\nMy parents passed away in October and November last year. In their will 75% of all their money was mine and my brother kept 25% (the minimum allowed by law). My brother tried to object, but my parents did something very detailed so he wouldn't have a chance. They didn't say why in the will it would be annullable, they just made their wishes clear.\n\n I don't agree with their motivation, but my brother had to just keep his mouth shut for a few more years and he probably would have gotten the 75% instead of me. Making it clear that 25% is a lot. \n\nAfter years of never having even been with a man, I finally decided to come out and I'm in a serious relationship. \n\nMy brother found out through some mutual friends and he basically called me saying that I had betrayed my parents all these years to get half of his share and that the minimum, ethically, was to give him his deserved share, because I only earned it by lying to them.\n\n I denied it, saying that I just had no reason to come out if I know there is a lot of money on the line and if he hadn't thought about it, it wasn't my fault. \n\nSome friends and family are criticizing me for this, saying that I should do right in light of my parents' motives. \n\nSo... AITA? Btw I'm clear with the law.\n\nWe don't have a relationship, we just have the same blood. My brother is the same person as when I left the ICU after 30 days of covid (before he came out), he didn't even send a message asking if I was okay. The same person who called me stupid/retard for failing a year at schoo. lThe same person who said I was the defective child my parents can't return AND CAN'OT put up for adoption because they're religious.

OP, while I understand that you didn't want to be disowned, the fact is, your brother did not deserve to be treated badly by your parents. Your parents were major homophobic AHs, and they ruined their relationships with you and your brother thanks to their fanatical religious beliefs. Money is one thing, but now that both of your parents are dead, your brother is the last surviving member of your immediate family. Do your really want to ruin your relationship with him over money? Your brother deserves to have at least half the money, so don't be a greedy jerk. I hope you will eventually reconcile and apologize to your brother in the long run, because he is just as much as victim as you are.", "YTA\n\nOf course you're clear within the law, but that's not why you came here.\n\nBut are you really here asking if you're not the asshole because you were smart enough to trick someone in to giving you money and that you \"deserve\" the money for being smart enough to lie?\n\nAlso, you definitely are an asshole for dating those women just to complete your cover story.\n\nYour parent's behavior was reprehensible, but you're not doing too hot yourself. You don't have to give your brother any money, but you know more of it should be his, because you are honoring the reprehensible will of bigots.", "YTA", "YTA because you're a liar. Your brother called you on not coming out so you would get the money, and you denied it to him. But you admitted it to us.\n\nThe will is valid so you're not obligated to give your brother anything.

At the end of the day, it will have been the former. Your brother lived honestly, you did not.

It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s not about 75% or 25%. It\u2019s the fact that you enjoy that you became the better son even though you were a closet gay. Good job for being able to hide yourself in order to profit from it but your brother wasn\u2019t afraid to hide who he was.\n\nOn the other side of this your brother is the AH as well because he probably thought he still was some golden child. He came out, was \u201cdisowned\u201d but still had his college paid for and got 25% of the money. He probably sees you as a hypocrite because you were gay as well and despite him being favored for so many years, you got the bulk of the profit. He also put you down over those years that once he was out of the way it probably changed you as a person to feel appreciated for once. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019s written that you get 75%. So that\u2019s that. You\u2019ll be set for many years. You endured hiding yourself to appease your parents, but\u2026 mostly for profit sake. I just have to wonder, after everything you and your brother went through with parents who wished you weren\u2019t gay, don\u2019t you think you two have common ground?

You\u2019re grown now and I wonder if the past can be left in the past.", "Everyone saying OP is the asshole but.. he was being abused by his brother.. OP and the brother knew about how the parents were. OP played the long game. Guarantee it hurt him to have to pretend to be something he wasnt.

Who are you to morally abuse him after he has been his whole life, and abused by his dipshit brother, who couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants long enough. YTA for not understanding the game of life.", "By will, the person can leave up to half of the inheritance to the person and the other half to the heirs. By will I have 50% and as an heir, 25%.", "Your brother is paring for years of bullying. If he\u2019d shown love and empathy towards you, neither of you would be in this position. I\u2019m sorry you lost your whole family. Enjoy your money. NTA", "No he showed cowardice and greed.", "Yep, this is a remix of the one with \u201cOliver\u201d and his \u201cally\u201d sister. Yawn.", "His brother has bullied him all his life, didn't care about him when he came out of hospital. There's no relationship. He doesn't owe that abuser anything.", "Well it wasn't a \"death sentence \" for him and it's his story, not some other gay man's story.", "Exactly. How can he ruin a relationship with his brother when the brother didn\u2019t even treat him well.  He was hospitalized and he didn\u2019t even bother to check in on him.", "He already told you he was a liar so how you going to believe his sob story.", "Did you miss the part where the brother treated OP like crap?? Op owes him NOTHING", "His brother is an entitled ablest jerk, who made fun of his disabilities, I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s gay I wouldn\u2019t have given him money if both us were straight I\u2019d tell him to go fuck himself", "if he was truly owed it would\u2019ve been given to him! should\u2019ve played his cards right", "This. You played the game of life and won with the money. Not your fault, \u201cthe golden boy\u201d, didn\u2019t understand the rules.", "Yes!  Conned those homophobic fuckers!", "So his \"golden child\" brother who bullied OP most of his life gets a pass? Why the heck didn't the brother put HIMSELF in OP's shoes.\n\nYou are disgusting!!", "Good response. It's the resentment that really gets me. Both of them experienced being the \"golden child\" but OP chose to pretend to be straight and put his life on hold for this future payday and it must've really pissed him off that his brother was living the life he wanted.", "He DIDN'T date men. Loophole unlocked, top score acheived... golden child is just salty cuz he lost the spotlight over the brother he was as much of an AH to as the parents", "Surprised I had to scroll this far for this take. The whole family sounds like AHs.", "Scapegoat Op is lucky to be done with the brother that played up being goldenchild.", "He didn\u2019t cheat shit. He fucked over bigoted boomers and got money they left to him. He followed their instructions until they died. My family doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m Bi, it\u2019s none of their fucking business \n\nNTA but he should probably share some more money with the brother.", "It wasn't about courage at all? Brains beats brawn. It took strength for the brother to come out, but it took brains for op to say silent", "I think you're absolutely right. OP and his brother need to attend some therapy and counseling, and hopefully, they will repair their relationship.", "Again, what country ? That sounds like a crock.", "Maintained a lie to be filthy rich.  What a classy person", "His parents were the abusers. They were the ones to isolate his brother. Pretending to be someone you\u2019re not to get a bigger cut of inheritance is low, which is why I said he\u2019s not entitled to share. But given all the trauma in their lives, I would try to mend things.", "He did. \n\nHe said \u201cafter years of not having been with a man, I finally decided to come out and am in a serious relationship\u201d.", "No it took cowardice to stay silent.", "Lol imagine thinking someone\u2019s sexuality is information you or anyone else is entitled to", "Yeah after they parents are fucking dead. They don\u2019t get a say once they\u2019re dead", "He knew that speaking up had consequences. Are you are saying it's cowardly to not come out to your parents?"]}
