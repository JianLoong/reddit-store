{"id": 22350, "submission_id": "150uvag", "title": "AITA for not sharing my inheritance with my brother after coming out as gay?", "selftext": " I came from an extremely religious and conservative family. My parents had me and my twin brother late (infertility). And they were filthy rich. \n\nOne thing they always made clear was that if they knew one of us was dating men, they would write us out of the will. \n\nI've known I was gay since I was 10, but I didn't want to lose my fat heritage so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nMy brother was the opposite, he decided to come out when he left for college and, sure enough, my parents disgraced him. They literally gave him money to cover all his college expenses until he graduated and they  never spoke to him again. \n\nMaking it clear that at no point I agree with this, but I didn't say anything because I'm simply not on good terms with my brother.\n\n I have autism and ADHD, and so I have a lot of difficulties, unlike my brother who was the brightest of the family (my parents' words). This directly impacted the relationship between me and him, because I was the \"defective\" son that my parents could not return to the factory and my brother always abused that. \n\nAfter my brother came out, I became the favorite son and even dated some women at the time to take the pressure off. \n\nMy parents passed away in October and November last year. In their will 75% of all their money was mine and my brother kept 25% (the minimum allowed by law). My brother tried to object, but my parents did something very detailed so he wouldn't have a chance. They didn't say why in the will it would be annullable, they just made their wishes clear.\n\n I don't agree with their motivation, but my brother had to just keep his mouth shut for a few more years and he probably would have gotten the 75% instead of me. Making it clear that 25% is a lot. \n\nAfter years of never having even been with a man, I finally decided to come out and I'm in a serious relationship. \n\nMy brother found out through some mutual friends and he basically called me saying that I had betrayed my parents all these years to get half of his share and that the minimum, ethically, was to give him his deserved share, because I only earned it by lying to them.\n\n I denied it, saying that I just had no reason to come out if I know there is a lot of money on the line and if he hadn't thought about it, it wasn't my fault. \n\nSome friends and family are criticizing me for this, saying that I should do right in light of my parents' motives. \n\nSo... AITA? Btw I'm clear with the law.\n\nWe don't have a relationship, we just have the same blood. My brother is the same person as when I left the ICU after 30 days of covid (before he came out), he didn't even send a message asking if I was okay. The same person who called me stupid/retard for failing a year at schoo. lThe same person who said I was the defective child my parents can't return AND CAN'OT put up for adoption because they're religious. And many worse things.\n\nMy parents' motivation was terrible, but I don't want to help someone who was terrible with me", "created_utc": 1689476472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150uvag/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my/", "score": 1493, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP, while I understand that you didn't want to be disowned, the fact is, your brother did not deserve to be treated badly by your parents. Your parents were major homophobic AHs, and they ruined their relationships with you and your brother thanks to their fanatical religious beliefs. Money is one thing, but now that both of your parents are dead, your brother is the last surviving member of your immediate family. Do your really want to ruin your relationship with him over money? Your brother deserves to have at least half the money, so don't be a greedy jerk.

You don't have to give your brother any money, but you know more of it should be his, because you are honoring the reprehensible will of bigots.", "YTA", "YTA because you're a liar. Your brother called you on not coming out so you would get the money, and you denied it to him. But you admitted it to us.\n\nThe will is valid so you're not obligated to give your brother anything. It would be a nice gesture, but you don't like him, so I suppose you wouldn't do that...but, you're the one who'll have to live with your conscience. You must have some doubts or you wouldn't have posted here.\n\nOf course if yr parents knew about you they wouldn't have left the $$ to you either...one could say to really honor their wishes, you should give away 50% of yr inheritance so that you only get 25% like yr brother.", "Did your parents have a problem with you or your brother *being* gay, or just knowing about it? At the end of the day, it will have been the former. Your brother lived honestly, you did not.

It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s not about 75% or 25%. It\u2019s the fact that you enjoy that you became the better son even though you were a closet gay. Good job for being able to hide yourself in order to profit from it but your brother wasn\u2019t afraid to hide who he was.\n\nOn the other side of this your brother is the AH as well because he probably thought he still was some golden child. He came out, was \u201cdisowned\u201d but still had his college paid for and got 25% of the money. He probably sees you as a hypocrite because you were gay as well and despite him being favored for so many years, you got the bulk of the profit. He also put you down over those years that once he was out of the way it probably changed you as a person to feel appreciated for once. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019s written that you get 75%. So that\u2019s that. You\u2019ll be set for many years. You endured hiding yourself to appease your parents, but\u2026 mostly for profit sake. I just have to wonder, after everything you and your brother went through with parents who wished you weren\u2019t gay, don\u2019t you think you two have common ground? And a gesture with the money could bring you two together again? You\u2019re grown now and I wonder if the past can be left in the past.", "Everyone saying OP is the asshole but.. he was being abused by his brother.. OP and the brother knew about how the parents were. OP played the long game. Guarantee it hurt him to have to pretend to be something he wasnt.

Their motivation for dividing the inheritance unequally also seems unethical. \n\n- Regardless of the parents' actions, the two brothers should try to treat each other with compassion. Holding grudges about childhood conflicts will only breed more resentment. \n\n- The inheritances were likely substantial amounts of money if 25% was still \"a lot.\" In the interests of family harmony, it may be good to split it more evenly, even if not required legally.\n\n- That said, the brother who came out earlier did directly ignore the parents' wishes, even if those wishes were problematic. The other brother kept his sexuality private longer at personal cost. It's understandable if he feels entitled to the larger share.\n\n- There are good arguments on both sides here. My inclination would be to compromise and split it down the middle, but reasonable people could disagree. Open, non-judgmental communication between the brothers is most important.\n\nThis is a ethically complex situation stemming from the parents' discriminatory views.

Also I feel like you\u2019re assuming I\u2019m straight by wording this the way you to did to which I say: you\u2019re making your own assumptions about him and me and everything else on this thread just like everyone does. If his family and friends that have heard more and are privy to more angles of the *whole* picture are reproaching him, then I feel like it\u2019s likely he\u2019s trying to put himself in the best possible light here on reddit to get NTA votes but I\u2019m sorry, his story didn\u2019t convince me. I\u2019m not saying he wasn\u2019t bullied but he\u2019s making a lot of assumptions about *his* brother also. Not that it excuses his brother\u2019s behavior, however, it\u2019s commonly known that ADHD and autism are often genetic so it\u2019s totally possible his brother has stuff going on he doesn\u2019t know about too. Regardless, based only on what he\u2019s said himself, OP is a liar, manipulator, and a user of women *at best*.

I have no sympathy for this guy dating women so he doesn\u2019t blow his cover to ensure that he gets the inheritance.", "Exactly. Dude knew he had a bunch of cash coming his way. Maybe the number is a few zeroes smaller\u2026 my assumption from the post is that 25% is a life changing amount of money.", "the only correct answer here is ETA. the brother for abusing his favourite child status, op for all of those disgusting remarks proving he's greedy, and the parents for obvious reasons. sounds like an exhausting family", "Sorry, what's the danger you're referring to? They still paid for the out brother's tertiary education.\n\nThe OP did what he did for more money, not because the family would do anything dangerous to him.\n\nIf the parents were absolutely loaded then 25% is probably a substantial inheritance and the out brother is probably well off now. But OP didn't want to just be well off, he wanted to have more.\n\nOpinions on OP aside, it boils down to OP wanting to have a relationship with his brother or not. It's his decision.\n\nEdit - just wanted to add that OP has changed his original post without saying so, my posts are in regards to his original post which had no mention of his brother's supposed abuse.", "straaaiiight up. all these Y T A s having zero idea what it means and how it feels to HAVE to protect your own sexuality against bigoted family. i had to do the same most of my adolescence and i'm not getting shit out of it lmao. i would have 10000% kept my mouth shut for YEARS longer if it meant a fat payout from monsters. these fucking people", "While the brother certainly did/said some mean things, I\u2019m not seeing what is cut someone out of the will-worthy here. Take it from someone who actually has an abusive brother\u2026calling someone stupid and saying they should\u2019ve been adopted, while very mean and should never have been said, are pretty common things for brothers to say each other (depending on the age, but from the sound of the things the brothers don\u2019t seem to have been on good terms for a while). The worst thing presented here was not checking up on him in the hospital, but considering they don\u2019t have a relationship by OP's own admission, why would he? \n\nI'm willing to change my opinion if there is more evidence, but based on what's been presented, all OP has going fir them is \"the law doesn't require me to\".", "I don't.

Saying that OP \"showed restraint\" by pretending to be someone he's not and suggesting he was rightfully rewarded for it is gross.\n\nOP made the decision to hide who he was for the money.

Saying he \"conned his parents\" is weird.
