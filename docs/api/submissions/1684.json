You usually have to clean the room afterwards again anyway. Plus, I like to give them space when they're hanging out. So I said it wasn't a good time.\n\nShe was really surprised and asked why.

I know it doesn't bother her, but I'm responsible for this child, so I can't in good conscience pressure him to stay outside. We talked about it for ten minutes, and finally I just said that it wasn't a good time and she needs to respect that.\n\nShe started to cry, and I felt really bad.

I told her she was welcome to come to the party, but she said she couldn't because she had to be at church all day. I said she could come during the week, although I know it's hard for her to make it on weekdays, and she knows I know that, so that suggestion just offended her, and she said I was being a bitch.\n\nHonestly, I still feel bad about it. Maybe I was just being neurotic. It is possible to clean a room with other people in it, I just wanted to make things easier for me.

There are plenty of other rooms you could have cleaned while the older boy was visiting his mother.  Also, when they visit, I highly doubt they trash the place.\nAnd guess what\u2026 a birthday party\u2026 messes places up.\nYou claim to want to do what\u2019s best for the children\u2026 seeing their parents, who are not abusive, is best.  Yet you withheld that to clean.  Seriously? Wtf is wrong with you.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s interesting how she said she can\u2019t because she\u2019s at church all day. If she\u2019s so upset about it, what about making her child a priority and not church? NTA.", "NTA  it is unreasonable to expect you to be able to accommodate last minute requests like this.  You had plans. You are doing the mother and her son a great service fostering him and allowing her access most of the time. She is being ungrateful and presumptuous to expect you'll always be able to accommodate her with little notice and no regard for your own plans.", "NTA -\n\nYou have a loving heart and are trying to help these children and their families. That you are respectful of the social worker's time and this mother is a credit to you as well. \n\nI am sorry the Mom reacted this way and you are owed an apology.  It is NOT up to her to dictate what a good excuse is - you were busy - end of story. You are NOT beholden to her to give her an explanation, but were gracious in doing so. You are not required to drop everything to accommodate her...and I suspect you have done just that more than once.\n\nShe called you at the last minute wanting to come visit her child - it's not like you cancelled a pre-scheduled visit.  I am sure it was disappointing to her that you were not available for this visit to happen, but what she said to you was WAY out of line.  \n\nShe has apparently had some issues with making good decisions - and obviously that hasn't changed because she wanted you to allow her to still visit after you said no, and then said they'd stay outside in the cold (not good for the child either) then kinda threw a tantrum b/c you said \"not right now\" when before you've always said yes.  She is trying to manipulate your caring, loving heart. She doesn't respect that you've allowed her to have your phone number AND know where you live. \n\nYou have a soft heart - but just in case something else happens or this turns into something bigger you need to document this interaction as well as report it to the social worker.  \n\nThe social worker needs to tell her to apologize, sincerely otherwise no more calling you directly or coming to your home.   The Mom needs to realize she is NOT the one in charge here.  Please do not allow her to make you feel bad about this!! You did NOTHING wrong in trying to get things ready and nice for another foster child to have a lovely birthday when he does not get the choice of being able to visit or contact his family.", "Is it possible she wanted to see him before his birthday; that you celebrating it instead of her had her feeling resentful?

Your need to clean a room was prioritised over a mother seeing their child they love. Do you even care about this child or is it just a paycheck for you? Is keeping his mum he loves and must miss terribly from spending time with him really the right thing to do here. \nShe called you a b*tch because that\u2019s how you acted in that moment."]}
