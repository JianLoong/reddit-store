The person giving birth has full say as their body and life are on the line. You\u2019re supposed to go through labour and delivery and then be overrun with people while your perineum is stitched  and you\u2019re bleeding profusely whilst sitting on ice packs after how long in labour?\n\n\nEveryone can take several seats, you and your partner and your baby are the ones that matter. Hold that boundary.", "NTA\n\nHaving a baby come out of your literal vagina can be as private of an affair as you need it to be.\nThere is no need for bystanders if you're not comfortable with it.", "NTA. Giving birth is the toughest and the most vulnerable situation most of us will ever be in. We need the conditions to be as favorable as they can possibly get. This includes removing all stress factors that can be avoided, including having people in the waiting room. They don't even need to know when you go into labor, TBH.", "NTA. Birth is a major medical event. Nobody after having any type of surgery has family and visitors barging in the moment they enter the recovery room. Your focus after delivery should be on recovering from birth and breastfeeding. You need time to ensure both you and baby are stable and okay and to let the nurses do their assessments and checks. I am currently pregnant and plan to do the same thing as well. I don\u2019t want the pressure of knowing there\u2019s a bunch of people in the waiting area that want to see the baby asap. And that\u2019s really what it is- they want to be first to see the baby and ogle over it and it\u2019s not really about you or the baby\u2019s wellbeing or nobody would expect that. Plus with cell phones now there\u2019s no reason people need to wait in the hospital while a woman gives birth, it\u2019s easy to update family now and let them know when you\u2019re ready for visitors. Plus women get discharged pretty quickly now after delivery so there\u2019s almost no point. It\u2019s not like our parents\u2019 time when women had to be admitted for 4 days after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.", "NTA. Good on you for setting this boundary now before you're dealing with the stresses of being pregnant.", "NTA \n\nGrandparents can ask the mother to be if they may be in the delivery room or waiting area, but they are not guaranteed a seat (so to speak). It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s up to the birthing parent and they\u2019re partner to decide, and this is a decidedly 2 yes/1 no situation. I can\u2019t imagine trying to love  on the baby that just came out of my body while the grandmas fight over who gets to hold the baby first and who the babies look like more \ud83d\ude44\n\nFWIW, a few of the hospitals near me have a 2-person max limit for people witnessing the actual birth. I had a friend put me down as her #2 because she knows I go out of my way to not visit  Moms and babies at hospitals to begin with there. There was no way I was going to be there for the delivery \ud83e\udd23", "Edit: Thank you for everyone who\u2019s commenting, I\u2019m just kind of lost in this situation and have been thinking about the hypotheticals a lot lately. I wanted to clarify a couple of things, first being that my mom is known for steamrolling people. The word \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t in her vocabulary and she\u2019s not used to hearing it often so when I do say no or set boundaries it\u2019s always followed by \u201cbut what if we..\u201d or \u201cwell what if I\u2026\u201d no is never enough. She will pick at people and guilt trip until she gets her way. Because of that I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve had to be an asshole on MANY occasions and put my foot down, but I didn\u2019t think this was one of them. They asked about my friend, I told them what was going on and how upset she was by their parent\u2019s reaction, then told them my own POV and that I agreed with her decision. I honestly didn\u2019t expect my parents to react in that way considering there\u2019s a general understanding of how strained our relationship is overall. I\u2019ve known for a long time that I wouldn\u2019t want my mom in the delivery room with me and that it would make me feel extremely stressed. I just assumed that she would understand that because that\u2019s not the type of relationship we have. I had just never considered how I would want to approach having family in the waiting room until recently, and honestly I don\u2019t like the idea of it because it makes me uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want to purposefully hurt anybody or exclude them, but I also want to put myself/my partner first when that day comes.", "NTA\n\n60 + Grandma here. You are not wrong, and the entitled attitude is not generational. Grandparents do not have rights. They earn the privilege of a relationship with these little humans with their actions.\n\nBut remember, if we love our children and do our best as parents, we will love and care for these little ones just that much more. Good parents are their children's #1 fans. And these precious little humans come from you!", "NTA.\n\nDeliverying a baby is a medical procedure, not a spectator sport.  You and the medical team need to concentrate on you having a safe delivery, not on placating people who are more concerned about their own feelings rather than your health and that of the baby.", "NTA. Grandparents have no right to be there unless they\u2019re invited by the person giving birth.", "NTA - your kid, your rules", "You are super mature picking a hypothetical fight. Keep it up.\n\nYta", "YTA,  It really feels like you set a boundary to piss off your family off.  I think you have a crazy idea of what its like post birth with the family.  Yes there is a moment where your parents and siblings might be in the same room as you, but then they are usually ushered out, and usually just a mom or sister will stay if wanted, if not its just you and the partner.  Family usually waits outside for when needed.  A lot of new mothers will want their mother there, even if not in the same room, just knowing they're in the next room will bring comfort.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a life or death event and the only people that need to be there are the mother and her support team - the doctors and nurses, and her partner, friends and family ONLY if they are part of her support network.\n\nI'm very close to my mother, aunt and Dad, so I would want them there because I can trust them to keep an eye on the baby to make sure it is alright, on my partner to make sure he is alright, and on me to make sure I'm alright while I am drugged out of my mind and stressed out.\n\nNot everyone has that close connection to their family. You should ONLY have people that are part of your most inner circle with you. If someone causes you any stress or you feel you can't close your eyes and trust them not to be up to drama with your brand new baby, then they can wait until you are fully recovered.", "NTA.... but you gave no indication that your parents were unaccepting or had any problem with this position.", "NTA.  First, you are never an asshole for your emotions.  They just are.  It's only behaviors that can make a person an asshole.\n\nSecond, the \"birth as a family party\" idea seems to have gotten out of hand.  Started out back when I had my daughter (mumble-mumble years ago) as a matter of the father coming in as a coach and support, particularly for natural childbirth.  Now it seems that it's supposed to be entire families and live streamed, I suppose with everyone expected to all wear lime green for the bride's pho -- excuse me.  I got off track.\n\nGiven their expressed ideas of what they are entitled to, it will be safest to simply not tell them when you go into labor.  After the baby is born, the initial bonding begun, then you send out the notifications and a photo of the three of you waving.  They'll be pissed.  Tough.  Life's like that.", "NTA. Childbirth is not a spectator sport. If you live in a jurisdiction with grandparents\u2019 rights, they mainly acquire them by being in the child\u2019s life. That\u2019s something you can control. And it definitely doesn\u2019t apply to labor and delivery. I would tell them you feel the same way about parents and in-laws who try to invade a woman\u2019s privacy.\n\nWhen I was in labor, the last thing I wanted was distractions. I needed to focus on me and what was happening with my body. Having someone else in the room besides my husband would have been awful.", "That's not what grandparents rights are, at all (your parents' version I mean). LOL. NTA", "NTA.  This is a private moment between husband & wife.  There's no need for the grandparents to be there during the delivery.   I remember when I had my first.  I asked no one to come to the hospital until I was ready to invite them.  As I'm being wheeled into the delivery room, I see my inlaws.  I was livid.  I asked one thing & they couldn't respect me enough to wait for the invitation.", "NTA.  You can't really keep them from coming up and hanging around the hospital and maybe getting a peek at the baby through the windows.  But you can absolutely control who comes in to see you.  You just need to be on the same page with your partner.  When my wife had my son, it was a c-section and her recovery took a minute.  I showed off the baby to family through the windows of the maternity ward and kept them informed of what was going on.  They didn't come to my wife's recovery room until she was good and ready to have visitors.  Everyone was totally fine with that.  Your parents can just back up.", ">NTA - giving birth is not a spectator\u2019s sport.\n\nI head somewhere that every extra person in the delivery room adds an hour to the birth.  If your parents and your partner's parents invade, that's an extra 4 hours in labour.\n\nAlso, the nurse in my prenatal classes also told us that the experience of childbirth influences the ability to bond with the child.  A bad birth makes it harder to bond with your child.\n\nHaving your parents and ILs in the delivery room will not only add significant time to your delivery, but potentially permanently harm your relationship with your child.  This is definitely a hill to die on.", "Never feel bad for telling a selfish person to back off. You will be bleeding, in agony and vulnerable as hell, equal parts likely to be traumatised as well. Who knows what your future babies situation would be as well?\nIt\u2019s not selfish to put the welfare of yourself and your newborn ahead of your parents.\nPlus it\u2019s not like your mother wasn\u2019t there for your own birth.

If she isn\u2019t someone who will lower your blood pressure then don\u2019t let her near you until you\u2019re good and ready for mind games (when you\u2019re at that stage of having kids).\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her your trauma for her entertainment. Everyone has a different relationship with their parents. You know yours best.
