It feels like he is using the sister's schooling as an excuse to not have to finance the wedding just because he hates his future DIL.", "I didn't promise the amount of money though. I could give him a dollar and call it keeping my promise if this is what matters", "I\u2019m willing to bet this \u201ceducational opportunity\u201d was only discovered after the wedding was announced. OP just doesn\u2019t want to pay for the wedding and is, retroactive to the promise given, finding a more \u201cnoble\u201d use for the money just to defend their actions.", "Two things can be true", "Of course he is. If I had to guess, the reason he doesn't like the fiance is because he knows she sees what a puffed up little man he is and doesn't give him the unqualified respect he thinks is his right as the patriarch of the family.", "Why not both?", "Yes she is suddenly starting highschool", "Dick move", "That's an AH response if I've ever heard one.", "Did you promise to give \"some money\" or to \"pay for the wedding\"? \"Pay for\" generally means cover costs... honestly, even if you did choose your wording carefully so you could be deceitful about it... still YTA", "Yeah, I'm sure that'll smooth things over.\n\nLook, if you're really ready to torch your relationship with your son just because you don't like his wife, go ahead.  Just don't be surprised when he no longer cares to include you in his life.", "Using technicalities to weasel their way out of something is typically a pretty clear sign someone knows they are the AH and are just trying to manipulate the situation for the best results for them.", "So you won\u2019t be paying for her wedding then in the future, right?", "But you knew your daughter was super smart and would benefit from a private education for a long time. Did you not prepare for that? It appears that there\u2019s a pretty wide age range between your kids so how did it not occur to you that one of older kids would get married while their little sister was still in high school? Did you warn your kids this could happen? That\u2019s what I mean by convenience. Your daughter\u2019s education isn\u2019t an unexpected expense so it\u2019s going to be very hard for your son to believe that the reason you\u2019re not paying for his wedding is because you have to pay for his little sister\u2019s private school.", "\u201cShe is suddenly starting highschool\u201d \n\nWas this a surprise? How is it sudden you had like 14 years to prepare.", "Suddenly?  As in unexpectedly?  She skipped straight from kindergarten?  Or did high school naturally follow in the order one would have expected it to?", "You think I didn't send the rest of my kids to school?", "Even if she could skip grades, the parents have ultimate say over whether they will, so still ways to figure it out.", "Did you pay for them to go to this expensive high school?", "They didn't get accepted", "Then you didn't plan accordingly and are now the AH. She didn't \"suddenly\" start high school you knew she would be going. Now you've decided to punish one kid for something unprecedented and reward your other child with their promised money."]}
