Maybe then you\u2019ll understand how I know something that was plainly stated \ud83d\ude44.", "For sure, he\u2019s free to show his favouritism amongst his children. Now they all know where each one stands with daddy dearest. Though it was a promise to all his children, he\u2019s not legally liable. However, he\u2019s not free from the social consequences of breaking his promise to his son when he already fulfilled it for other siblings.", "He doesn\u2019t have the money for his daughters wedding just yet it seems. He has enough for one of the two things. What if the daughter really does need the help to get into a good college to secure her future? Should that just get ignored because he made a promise about a wedding? What about the sons responsibility to be compassionate towards his sister in need? There\u2019s options here. When he has more funds again, maybe he can help his son in a few years and help them set up a savings for their future family, or vacation, or whatever. I also don\u2019t like that he talked about the fianc\u00e9, but I\u2019m thinking more about the daughter. I\u2019m a daughter, and I put myself in her shoes.. what if I really needed the help? Should my parents just ignore that so my older brother can have a wedding?\n\nCircumstances change. Promise get broken. Maybe the father just doesn\u2019t make quite as much money anymore. I\u2019m sure if there was enough to go around to all of his kids all at once, he would. He sounds like a caring father over all. We don\u2019t know what obstacles there were but we know life happens. And sometimes hard decisions have to be made. I feel for the guy.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, she probably just has her own mind.", "\u201cNo, you may not speak to me that way\u201d would be more than enough for OP to confuse for being egotistical.", "RIGHT?! Is she egotistical, or is your misogyny  showing?", "Like actresses being \"divas\" might be code for not putting up with pervert producers", "Future DIL probably doesn\u2019t put up with his BS.", "Or she has good boundaries and stands up to him and he REALLY doesn't like that.", "Nah his replies show he has favoritism and clearly likes daughter more than son.", "Ok smartass. Obviously it said he promised. Does it tell you why? Does it tell you what brought up the promise? Doesn't say if he was asked to pay the first time then promised to the others? \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "Same. My EX FIL told me I have their last name now and that I needed to act like it. \n\nTook mine back", "She probably also already has had to call him out for AH behavior before now.", "Yeah he said that but I too think he doesn't like/prefer his son at all", "You forget the this is reddit the first thing they do is play the race card.", "You think it\u2019s a large assumption that OP knew that kids go to school?", "I take \u201cinsufferable and egotistic\u201d to mean that she\u2019s not a doormat and sets healthy boundaries.", "For argument\u2019s sake a parent can\u2019t know years ahead that he\u2019d have a prodigy that would benefit from an above average education. Right?\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry you can\u2019t go to the Academy that\u2019s super hard to get into but you qualify, I promised your older sibling I\u2019d use all that money on a two-day ego boosting event for him. Them\u2019s the breaks.\u201d", "Stealing? No. It's his money not the sons.", "1) If weddings were just a two-day ego boosting event, then wouldn\u2019t the argument be that OP should not have paid for ANY of his children\u2019s \u201ctwo-day ego boosting events\u201d?\n\n2) OP would not know that his daughter qualifies for the private school until he decided to have her apply for it. He also said his other kids \u201cdidn\u2019t get in.\u201d Therefore OP already had the POSSIBILITY of getting into private school in mind for a long time. This was not an unexpected situation.", "Also, it is your fault for making a promise and then not saving for two things you planned on paying for. Nobody is going to tell you your daughter's education is less important than a wedding party, but you should've planned for both of you planned on getting the clout of making a promise to your children.", "Enormous YTA, doesn't love his 3rd kid as much as the others, daughter is the fave.\n\nAlso you can do both things. Take out a loan or borrow money from family for your daughter if the school is that important to you. Does she even want to go to the expensive school?", "Whoah....wait just a minute here...\n\nI think it's worth exploring how much money we're talking about here\n\nAnd yes, OP was stupid to make an open-ended promise.\n\nHowever, If we're talking about a 5-figure wedding, I think any parent has a right to put the brakes on the spending. \n\nAnd anyway, \"helping\" leaves a lot of latitude.\n\nMoreover, youngest child shouldn't have to wind up the loser because of an expensive wedding.\n\nNTA...with the caveat that I don't believe you can't send youngest to school AND kick in some funds for the wedding.", "Also, why was there not a single pot of money divided by four for all the children?  If your son were marrying a woman you liked you'd still have the dilemma of giving it to the son and have nothing available for your daughter. \n\nYTA no matter what decision you make!", "So just forgetting a promise made and showing favoritism is ok? As a parent? That\u2019s a pretty fucked up mentality and example to set for your children.", "I suspect this isn't the first time he's treated his son like a second class family member.", "My FIL hated me. I married his only son and for some reason, he hated me. I\u2019m a positive, smart, beautiful woman who loves his son. So, long story short, my FIL died (I knew him for 15 long insufferable years). We never got to bury the hatchet. I never got to tell him how I felt, how the emotional abuse damaged me. The exclusion crushed me. The passive assertive comments and being ignored. \n\nI\u2019m going to suggest you explore why you despise this person your son chose to spend his life with. I\u2019d encourage a licensed therapist to help you dig into that. \n\nAnd I\u2019m going to say what I never got to say: I love your son and I\u2019m a great person. I have value. I am smart. My husband is very successful because I am the person behind him doing all the other stuff that allows him to shine. Judge all you want. I\u2019m not going anywhere. \n\nOP, YTA. You\u2019ve permanently ruined your relationship with your son and future DIL.", "Yes I thought the school was an excuse too.", "Logically speaking wouldn\u2019t you rather help your child get a better education rather than spend it all on a single night and forfeit your other child\u2019s chances at a better education? I agree OP is TA but seriously, what makes more sense from a rational point of view. Blowing a bunch of money on a party or paying for a child\u2019s education.", "Him being an AH for reneging on his promise and her being egotistical aren't mutually exclusive. Both of those things are totally plausible. Everyone assuming that his reservations with the DIL are unfounded just because of this situation shows how one dimensionally people think", "I\u2019m just waiting for the AITA from the son years from now regarding his wife being egotistical and y\u2019all piling up on her \ud83d\ude02 Sometimes a carrot is a carrot- stop projecting.", "Or he\u2019s the insufferable one and fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t put up with his BS.", "I think your conjecture is a huge stretch. We don\u2019t need to make up reasons to vilify OP and are supposed to make the judgment prima facie. \n\nMaking up a side story to call people racist or bigots is pretty serious.", "Except his son. If that was EVER a good relationship,  it definitely won't be after this.", "You sure have a talent for jumping to baseless conclusions. You dreamt up this whole storyline off of almost no information about the son and DIL's relationship. Either you have a wild af imagination or you really like making assumptions", "I think spending a lot of money on a wedding is wasteful. But that's not even remotely relevant. OP made a promise to his children. OP made large financial contributions to the other kids, but now refuses to for one of them.\n\nThe fact that OP is in the comments mocking the entire situation, makes it all the more clear this has nothing to do with doing what is logical.\n\nOP is just a raging asshole.", "They\u2019re projecting their own biases all over the place. It\u2019s frightening that they may someday be on a jury", "I think you\u2019re taking this too seriously.  This is AITA, not a court of law, and as we can\u2019t hear from the DIL then all we can do is go on the information given.\n\nAnd on the information given, OP was never going to pay for this wedding, broke his promise to his child, is playing favourites and making up reasons to explain his shitty parenting (ie the DIL is insufferable and egoistic, which could absolutely mean \u201cshe won\u2019t tolerate my bad behaviour\u201d).\n\nCourt* rules:  OP, YTA.\n\n*My opinion", "People here absolutely love jumping to conclusions and forming the wildest narratives without any sort of corroborating evidence.", "Crazy, isn\u2019t it?

Although, if I were the son, I wouldn't invite you to the wedding lol", "NTA\n\nPay for daughters school and start saving for sons wedding.

You go by what is presented- there are people making up entirely unfounded storylines of racism and misogyny (which is clearly undermined by valuing an education for his daughter) and so on.\n\nPrima facie is simply Latin for \u201con its face\u201d and isn\u2019t limited to a courtroom but rather is used in scenarios where one reads and draws conclusion. \n\nAnd frankly: if you think making up claims that somebody is a racist (which is a huge deal) is not that serious, then I think you\u2019re not taking it seriously enough."]}
