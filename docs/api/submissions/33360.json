I was baby wearing an infant and doing this with small hand clippers. Nothing large was removed by any measure. Calling what I did \u201cdestructive\u201d is a stretch. However, I can accept wrong and I won\u2019t be doing it next year. \n\nI feel like I should have thought this through better, but I\u2019m impulsive and now here I am.

One tradition I had with my mum growing up was going and collecting branches in the forest to make a Christmas wreath with.\n\n I am now grown with two kids of my own and I haven\u2019t made a wreath in years. I decided on a whim to take hedge trimmers to the park with us to collect branches so we could make a wreath. My (27f) daughter (2f) loved choosing the trees to take branches from and collecting them after I trimmed them. We had a great time. There was barely anyone else at the park and I really didn\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. Super wholesome fun and the wreath turned out beautifully. \n\nMy mother in law came over and complimented our wreath. My daughter was so excited to tell her we made it! I told my MIL what we did and where we got the branches from. She kind of shrugged it off and continued playing with my daughter. After the littles went for their naps my MIL gave me a hard time for taking branches from a public park, that it isn\u2019t like the forest and civilized people just don\u2019t do these things. She went on to say that it was illegal to do so and I was lucky nobody called the police. I was so confused. I hadn\u2019t thought there was any possibility that it would be illegal to mildly trim a few trees for a Christmas wreath. \n\nI am realizing now that i hadn\u2019t really thought it through and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m an ass for going into a public park to trim trees to make a wreath.

You not seeing it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.", "Most parks that are considered a state park are going to have similar rules. They're taken very seriously and you can get in significant amounts of trouble for tampering with the landscape not limited to littering, graffiti (including carving initials into trees for example), or other tampering with the flora/fauna in the park.", "There probably is someone like that and you just don\u2019t see them", ">  none of our parks are curated to the degree proposed\n\nYour personal opinion of the trims don't determine whether something is yours or public.", "I can guarantee that there's a Parks Department, Department of Natural Resources, and/or Department of Environmental Management that takes care of trees in your public spaces.", "We do.", "Imagine if everyone did what you did. Are you capable of that?", "A *foot*? Listen, you've clearly gotten the message so I promise I'm not trying to pile on, but to give you some perspective: a tree is considered \"fast-growing\" when it puts on two or three inches *a year*. A foot is multiple years of growth.", "If it\u2019s near a playground you and your neighbors are paying for the maintenance of that park. It\u2019s there so that everyone can experience a little bit of nature.\n\nIf you wouldn\u2019t take branches off of the tree in front of the public library you can\u2019t take branches here.", "Then, in general I'd say NTA.\n\nBut, if it is actually against local ordinance, then I'd say a bit, only because teaching your child to break the law isn't great, but I'm sure you could find an area near by that you could do that in.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "what happens if everyone does this?", "Yeah, that's not what I'm taking about. Maintenance is different from curation. Obviously people are making sure that the public green spaces are accessible and safe. No one is going around trimming trees for symmetry except in manicured and curated parks. That's the extent of my comment.", "What are you even talking about? I didn't make a comment about whether someone is entitled to take cuttings from public trees.", "That is a good point! Most of the pieces were much shorter than a foot, but all of them would have been more than a years worth of growth. I wasnt trying to do damage, but that is a good thing to point out. Thank you.", "Just because something isn't illegal it's ok?", "This is about property rights, not a question about environmentalism.
