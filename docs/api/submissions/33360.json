Thank you to those who kindly put me in my place, I clearly needed it. No thank you to those who were cruel and excessively rude. That was entirely unnecessary. I understand why trimming trees in a park is not something that I should be doing and it is not something I will be doing again. I grew up in an area with an abundance of trees and I guess that has led me to take them for granted. Something I will be reflecting on, as I think of myself as a considerate person and I would like that to continue, however in this instance I clearly did not embody that characteristic. I will be working on that. \n\n\nEditing to add: It was not entire limbs of the tree I was taking off, small pieces from the end of branches. I was baby wearing an infant and doing this with small hand clippers. Nothing large was removed by any measure. Calling what I did \u201cdestructive\u201d is a stretch. However, I can accept wrong and I won\u2019t be doing it next year. \n\nI feel like I should have thought this through better, but I\u2019m impulsive and now here I am. I grew up in an area with lots of community forests. One tradition I had with my mum growing up was going and collecting branches in the forest to make a Christmas wreath with.\n\n I am now grown with two kids of my own and I haven\u2019t made a wreath in years. I decided on a whim to take hedge trimmers to the park with us to collect branches so we could make a wreath. My (27f) daughter (2f) loved choosing the trees to take branches from and collecting them after I trimmed them. We had a great time. There was barely anyone else at the park and I really didn\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. Super wholesome fun and the wreath turned out beautifully. \n\nMy mother in law came over and complimented our wreath. My daughter was so excited to tell her we made it! I told my MIL what we did and where we got the branches from. She kind of shrugged it off and continued playing with my daughter. After the littles went for their naps my MIL gave me a hard time for taking branches from a public park, that it isn\u2019t like the forest and civilized people just don\u2019t do these things. She went on to say that it was illegal to do so and I was lucky nobody called the police. I was so confused. I hadn\u2019t thought there was any possibility that it would be illegal to mildly trim a few trees for a Christmas wreath. \n\nI am realizing now that i hadn\u2019t really thought it through and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m an ass for going into a public park to trim trees to make a wreath. My MIL certainly thinks so.

Think of a public park as belonging to your entire community, and think about what would happen if everyone did what you did.

Lots of other options.", "YTA. Former Park Ranger here. In the park systems I\u2019ve worked for, everything is protected. You should take nothing but photos and leave only foot prints.

Would there be any trees left in the park after a couple of years?\n\nIn my case, living in a city of over a million people, the answer would be no, of course not.

The idea of it being okay to just take it upon yourself to remove pieces of the park is ridiculous to me. Those trees are not mine to harvest from, and I would definitely be TA in this situation. \n\nBut, you might live in a smaller town with an enormous park.
