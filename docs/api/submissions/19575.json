My sister and I are usually very close. Both Jill and Nick are autistic.\n\nFor her 8th birthday Jill asked if she could have a party at our house because she has made friends at school this year, something she has had trouble with. I agreed and she invited 10 of her classmates. She also asked if she could invite her cousins and I agreed. She really only wanted Lily there, but she wanted to also invite Fin and Nick so they didn\u2019t feel left out. Fin didn\u2019t come, but my sister basically forced Nick to come because he doesn\u2019t usually get invited to birthday parties and social gatherings. He arrived in a Jedi costume (it was not a themed party) and my sister said it was the only way he agreed to come. I told her I didn\u2019t have a problem with it. He spent the whole party pretending to be a jedi, and interrogated a few of the other kids about being part of the empire. Jill told me that she didn\u2019t like it, and I asked my sister if she could talk to him. She did and he settled for a very brief period, but every time we would play a party game he would take over by loudly drawing attention to himself. When we sang happy birthday he caused a scene by throwing a tantrum by saying this party was stupid and so was everyone here. Jill cried and I asked my sister to take him home.\n\nShe later called me and told me I was cruel for making him leave, that I of all people should understand how much he struggles because I\u2019m autistic (though diagnosed in adulthood). I told her I do understand, but that he ruined Jill\u2019s first ever friend party, made the other kids upset at points by insulting them, and threw a tantrum when things weren\u2019t about him. I told her I know he struggles and doesn\u2019t understand but so does Jill, and I have to look out for her and that he won\u2019t be invited to future birthdays for a while.

My child is on the spectrum (he\u2019s a young adult now). I think autism does not excuse rotten behavior.  Parents need to stop acting like it does. \n\nWhen he was a baby (crawling and his first words) we were at my mother\u2019s house celebrating somebody\u2019s birthday.  The whole group was seated on the living room floor in a big circle. I called him over to come get cake/ice cream. He ignored me. (He was across the room from me, but directly in front of my sister). I repeated myself and he gave me one of his special \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 figuring I was too far away to immediately react. \nMy sister reached out and gave the rear end of his diaper a thump. He whirled around looking at me, trying to figure out how I had done that from all the way across the room. It was so funny & cute.

Being autistic does not excuse poor behaviors or lack of parenting your sister seems to do.", "YTA\n\nyou could use this as a teaching moment, you can talk it out with your sister instead of telling her son he's not welcome. your his family,have his back.", "He didn't even want to attend. He was obviously out of his element and he tried to make that clear. This was not the right party for him and his mother maybe should have known that.", "NTA this 100 percent. Your daughter is struggling herself. Although you may feel for him right now she needs to be your first priory.", "He originally didn\u2019t want to attend I don\u2019t think, but my sister wants him to have the ability to take part in social situations with other kids which I definitely do understand. But I don\u2019t think forcing him was the right thing to do either.", "I came looking for this take in the comments. \n\nHopefully once everybody's cooled down the OP can have a discussion about future parties with her sister and nephew. He definitely needed to leave, especially since he hadn't wanted to come in the first place, but banning him from future parties is too much. Kids change as they grow, and autistic or not, banning a kid for being disruptive at one party is too harsh.", "I agree with this. It was absolutely correct to remove him from the situation, especially as it was upsetting the child whose party it was, but permanently banning him isn't addressing the underlying cause: him being young and neurodivergent and not having the proper impulse control or social boundaries due to those things. Don't punish Nick for his mother not parenting him properly. Set boundaries on not dragging him along to social gatherings you're hosting if he doesn't want to (because that's another aspect, kids are already prone to tantrums when they're forced to go somewhere they don't want to be) and when he is to be removed before it gets to a point of escalation, and his parents have to be responsible for him and intervene when needed without being told. While his behavior was definitely an issue, it's a parenting problem at the root of it", "I am also autistic, I understand that he doesn\u2019t understand and I don\u2019t blame him for that. I should have been clearer that when I asked my sister to intervene I didn\u2019t ask her to ask him to stop being a jedi, I didn\u2019t have a problem with him pretending to be a jedi or being dressed up, other than initially being concerned the other kids might make fun of him. I asked her to intervene because he made a few of the other kids upset during some of his interrogations\u2019 of them because of some of the things he said (things like calling them stupid etc) not because of being a jedi. And because him loudly drawing attention to himself when he wasn\u2019t center of attention was upsetting Jill, which again isn\u2019t really his fault but Jill also doesn\u2019t really understand, and was understandably upset because she just wanted to play party games with her friends and eat cake. \n\nI don\u2019t think Nick is to blame, and neither is Jill. I do think my sister should have done more before the party because she knows that he doesn\u2019t understand, but I think what happened was that she didn\u2019t prepare at all and just was so excited he was invited to a social event that would have kids around his age that he wasn\u2019t related to that she assumed this would help him understand social situations more. Her only experience with autistic people before Nick was me, and I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until my late 20s because I learned very young how to be very good at masking. I think she thought that he would just automatically learn to integrate, which of course didn\u2019t happen.", "I mean, is it really up to her to \u201cteach\u201d to her sister who btw is an adult and older, has two kids more than OP and didn\u2019t listen to any advice OP gave her during the party regarding parenting her son after he insulted other kids, made Jill cry on her birthday party and threw tantrums? Of course he doesn\u2019t know better because he is 9 and also autistic, but that\u2019s when mom should step in and guide or redirect him!\n\nNTA", "I do understand her wanting him to go and get better as being social but she\u2019s not parenting very well if she isn\u2019t correcting the behaviors right away.

He needs time to figure out what works for him in social situations and my sister and BIL need to work with him on that, which will obviously be harder for him. It\u2019s definitely not his fault, but continuing to invite him will make it harder for both him and my daughter until he has adjusted and figured that out. I don\u2019t want my daughter to resent her cousin, and I also don\u2019t want my nephew to be made fun of and bullied by other children because of things he doesn\u2019t understand.", "Right now, it's more that your sister needs to do more to keep him from being such a disturbance that he ruins it for the other kids.

We may not understand how to navigate social situations as easily as neurotypical people, but that's no excuse for your sister to not parent. \n\nI was literally thanking my mother today for very specific instances in which she did just that (before we knew I was autistic). It's not Nick's fault if he doesn't know something is inappropriate. It is his fault if he doesn't stop. It's your sister's fault if she doesn't parent.

I would suggest having a family party where it\u2019s just a smaller hang out and then a separate friends party.", "This. As an autistic adult the problem person in this is the sister who forced her child to go to something he didn\u2019t want to go to and obviously didn\u2019t want to stay at.

What your sister needs to understand about her son, is that he *told her* what he wanted and he didn\u2019t want to go to the party.

There are more people than in other circumstances and it\u2019s very likely to be overstimulating which isn\u2019t a good combination. She should have removed him or offered him the chance to go home prior that. There was no reason she couldn\u2019t have dropped Lily off to enjoy the party without her and Nick being present if you\u2019d have been okay with it. Lily is family not a stranger and clearly wasn\u2019t disruptive to the party.", "Tldr : don\u2019t punish nick by not letting him over bc your sister doesn\u2019t help, set boundaries like not letting him over, or removing him from the room.
