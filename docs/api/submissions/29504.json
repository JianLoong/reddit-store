No Parent should EVER be manipulating another persons child, full stop and a comment about a recently lost and loved family member going to hell is manipulation. \n\nI would first try and find compromise with son, plan events in public spaces as opposed to a home, host the child at your home, and say something to the friends mom.  Let her know that while you were comfortable with your son being exposed to some religious ideas at your home, that you have to draw a line at speaking negatively about YOUR FAMILY MEMEBERS to the son because that isn't her place and frankly causes more trauma than helping and that while you support the friendship, until your son is a little older and is more objective, you are going to have to keep their playdates to school or public/group outings. \n\nIf she is steadfast in her ways, then maybe navigate cutting contact with the friend outside of school, but phase it.

You need to speak with the other mom in this case and let her know that, while you respect her opinions, it is not her place to push her religion on your son.  If she gets defensive ask the other mom if they want you talking about atheism to her son.  Her behavior is offensive at best in this case.  If she refuses to respect your point of view it's absolutely reasonable to say that you don't want your son going over there.", "That has always annoyed me. When people claim people are going to hell because they didn\u2019t follow a specific religion. If God 100% exists I doubt he would exclude someone because they didn\u2019t follow his religion especially since his poor communication is what helped create the other religions in the first place. \n\nWhen people say this I want to look at them and say so your child who could of died the moment of birth would be in hell right?  That such a sweet innocent baby who didn\u2019t have time to be baptized is suffering right now according to your logic.  I never say it but I always want to.  \n\nFor all we know this reality we live in is hell. We died on some other reality and got sent here without remembering the past.  I mean who is to say that the fictional stories we write are glimpses into what our world used to be and that\u2019s why we crave magic stories or horror stories. We want to live like we once were and this boring life of doing the same thing day in and day out is hell.\n\nThat above is just a joking theory not a fact.  We don\u2019t really know anything beyond what we know.  Religion could be true or it could be utter bs.  I say we stick to what we can validate in reality such as exploring our oceans rather than condemning someone we never met to a place that might not exist. \n\nAs far as what you are asking.  NTA . The other mom went too far and I would definitely want to keep away from her myself.  However you could of phrased this a bit better. \u201cHoney from now on I want you to spend time with your friend here ok?\u201d If your son asked why just responded, \u201c it\u2019s still so soon since aunt passed away. I would feel a bit better having you around more.\u201d  \n\nIf the other mom asks why be honest.  \u201cI understand you are religious and I can respect you following that.  However my sister only passed away this year it is still very fresh wound for us. What you said about my sister to him was inappropriate to say to a grieving kid.\u201d", "NTA. This woman is not only lying to your son but making him feel like shit. I\u2019m an atheist and I would be furious if someone told my child that their loved one was going to hell.

But her religion tells her to traumatize your child. \n\nThey can be friends at your house or school, but not where her ridiculous beliefs can poison his mind. Religion is fine.

You can mention you have no problem with your son\u2019s friend but what his mom said has made you very uncomfortable. You are happy he talked to you about it and are happy to talk about similar issues in the future, but you want to minimize him being in a position with his friends mom or at their church where he needs to defend himself or his beliefs. You can tell him that is has nothing to do with a lack of trust or doubt in his ability to handle things. Your job as a parent is to advocate for him and protect him, and you wouldn\u2019t be doing your job if you let him be in those types of situations.\n\nYour son may have some ideas about how to move forward that didn\u2019t occur to you.

Yeah, I'm a religious/Christian person and I think that's as TERRIBLE thing to say about someone's relative who passed. She was wayyyyy out of line spouting her (bad) theology in such a hurtful way.

Although I do think you should not let him go over there, you somehow need to understand the logic of it and show him that you still want him to be friends with the kid, so your son doesn't start to resent nad hide things from you.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to have all the facts before deciding whether or not to believe in something.\u201d\n\nTrust me, he\u2019s not getting all of the facts at church.", "NTA\n\nYou are right to protect your son from this toxic and abusive person.

The only thing I would say is that your son is going to be exposed to stuff in life. You can't protect him from it forever and learning how to deal with different (and sometimes judgmental) viewpoints is a skill he'll have to develop. I'm not sure it's worth blowing up an important friendship for him. I would definitely talk to the mom, though.", "ESH except the kids here.\n\nWhen I was a kid, one of my friends had a mom who was super-protestant.

Keep in mind that I'd estimate a good third of the town was Catholic- this was New Jersey- so in a way I admire this woman's confidence.  But it didn't really do me any harm, just made me go \"huh, Jack's mom is kind of nuts\".\n\nSo your son's friend's mom is obviously a piece of work, and I think telling your son he's not allowed to see her again is valid.

To me, it means 'complete'. Obviously at 10 there's a very different set of conversations that's appropriate than when your son's 16, but I do think in the US at least, it's really important to have a truly unbiased discussion of religion. Think of it like psychic vaccines. I've had a lot of conversations with my kid about all this for years, it's important. Same as making sure your kid isn't vulnerable to MLMs, and knows how to pick healthy friends and (later) romantic partners.\n\nAn unbiased view of Christianity means understanding the good, the bad and the ugly. I personally still ask WWJD even long after leaving the faith, Christ's worth knowing. I've personally known people who've survived a lot of hardship and made very hard, healthy decisions all because of their faith. I've also seen tremendous amounts of judgement, even from people that should know better, even when it's not Christlike. Christ himself had a lot to say about the Pharisees, and there's a lot of Pharisees out there these days. This all together is the unbiased perspective.\n\nIt's hard to find good friends, if your son's friend is a good person and it's just your son's friend's mom that's a problem, why not just invite over to your house? I think you're definitely justified in not wanting your son over there, but if you DO allow him to go, you'll need to start having a lot of conversations to arm him against what he'll find there. Either road is warranted, but think hard about this. These kinds of decisions are going to be enormously impactful on the future of your son's life, and on the future of your relationship with him. Keep calling in outside opinions and maybe talk through this with a therapist if you have/can get one. It's not a decision that should be made in the heat of the moment. Maybe even tell your son directly that you need to take two weeks to think this over and then have a conversation with him about what you'll be doing in the future about this.

Set boundaries (maybe only have them hang out at your house) and keep communication open. \n\nWhile I dont think he should spend time at their home (mom was WAY out of line; seems itching to indoctrinate), in general, I think it's actually a good thing to learn to work through difficult theological situations like this. Being able to be confronted with someone else's beliefs (even repugnant, cruel beliefs), think about it, feel it, and then choose to accept or reject it... It's good critical thinking practice for him and gives you a chance to have meaningful conversations with your son so he can choose what he believes as he grows up. Just like you did here, by talking it out and pointing out the fallacy in a wonderful person going to hell. Your son processed it, thought about it, and agreed that it didn't make sense. That's actually really huge, and I'm impressed with you both!\n\nI grew up very, very, VERY Mormon, but my parents divorced, and my dad left the church. I had several friends' parents ban them from hanging out with me at all because my dad now had coffee and alcohol at his house (even though he never drank around us; everything was locked away). I was a sinner by association. It hurt so much to lose friendships I treasured over the religious views of the parents involved. Don't do this to your son. Please.\n\nETA: Changing my vote to NTA.

It'd be kinda shitty to tell your son he can't see his friend outside of school and offer no alternative. I still don't think you're TA though.
