I'm not sure if this is true for your mom, but I realized that my mom wasn't capable of being the mother that I wanted. She's not capable of being emotional available, of being supportive or of not being judgemental. Knowing that, I can manage my own expectations and how I interact with her. It sucks but it doesn't leave me open to her letting me down again and again. You don't deserve this, and it isn't your fault. Some people just aren't capable of being mothers even if they gave birth. If you want to tell your mom how you feel, then I'd suggest writing a letter first.

My dad lived about 30 minutes away, and she had to suddenly move an hour and a half away. She still worked in my town, and would stop by for a brief supper every now and then, but I was low-key guilt tripped about wanting time with her when she had to hurry back. (My now-step-dad had a stroke and was in a rehab center and visiting hours were short. He had no one, so she had to be there).  \n\nI got her reasoning, but I was 17 and basically living alone the last 2 months of high school and the summer before college while also taking care of our slowly-going-out-of-business dog business. \n\n\nI harbored a LOT of anger and resentment and to be honest my trust in her is still a little shakey. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t talk to her much. But it didn\u2019t help. Because in her mind, and I\u2019m sure in your mom\u2019s mind, she did the right thing and it was the only option to her and I just had to understand it and I was mature enough to handle it. \n\nBasically- it really sucks and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. They shouldn\u2019t have left you. \n\nIgnoring your mom probably won\u2019t help any, yet I don\u2019t blame you in the slightest. If she seems open to your point of view, try sharing it? \n\n\nFor me, more than anything I missed my mom. She was my best friend. So ignoring her because I was hurt just caused me more hurt. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same with you, but maybe think on that. \n\nI hope this makes sense.
