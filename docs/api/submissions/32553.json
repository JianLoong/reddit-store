She came in the late in the evening and she was so exhausted that she just talked a bit and slept. The next day she went to see her aunt K because her cousin was getting married and she was helping with the planning me being part of the bridal team I had to get my hair and nails done so I didn't get to spend time with her.\nThe next day was the day of the wedding so we were both busy. Monday morning we were so exhausted but it was my dad's sister's birthday so we had to go to that in addition to seeing some other relatives during the day. \n\nTuesday was the day she had put aside to spend time with me throughout the day but she cancelled that because her being a pastor Aunt K called her asking her to preach at a memorial that morning as well as other people who wanted to see her in the afternoon and that evening so she called a cab for me that morning saying that she would see me that evening even though I had a feeling she wouldn't, and guess what... I was right. She came back so late that I fell asleep and only saw her the next morning for only afew hours and she had to go see my partenal grandparents who live very far from the city and I couldn't go with her because I had online lessons, again promising to come back early that evening this time she didn't, she slept at my martenal grandma's place only coming back today at 9pm. She's graduating tommorrow and I won't be able to attend because of my online test and a few importent lessons which are lasting the whole day. The next day is my martenal grandpa's memorial and then she leaves on Sunday early in the morning.
