Most of the time there are countless ups and downs when it comes to building a career or getting an education\n\nThe whole point of my comment is that no matter the context, OP shouldn\u2019t be inserting herself into his life as she has no business telling him what to do. It\u2019s not her life or her boyfriend. He\u2019s an adult, he can make his own decisions and form his own path in life. The world isn\u2019t black and white", "Yup, oh look at your daughter doing so well, continuing her education, oh but woe is me I don't have anyone paying for my education anymore. \n\nOh your going on a trip, I want to go abroad, but oh, woe is me, no one will pay for it", "There are plenty of examples of people not getting a ROI on a degree, which in that case was a waste of time.", "There are plenty of examples of people not getting a ROI on a degree, which in that case was a waste of time.", "People typically take longer to get their degrees because of other responsibilities, like family or jobs. This BF seems to have nothing else to do.", "But what do all of those things have to do with the OP being a jerk to him at the party?", "I remember a post about how a grown man had been doing to school for over 20 years, and was using it as a job, because he kept taking the school\u2019s portion of a government scholarship for aboriginals. \n\nHe had a partner that was unemployed as well. He was able to keep doing it because the school wasn\u2019t advertising the scholarship, so no one else was applying for it. It must have been a sizable scholarship if 2 adults were living off of it for 20+ years. \n\nMakes me sad to know it all went to some grown man who didn\u2019t want to get a job, rather than some \u201cup and coming\u201d teenager.\n\nOP admitted they weren\u2019t living great, and pretty much had the bare minimum, but neither of them had *any* drive at all to get actual jobs.", "From your mouth to God's ear.", "Calling OP a hypocrite with a useless art degree is not respectful. It's a personal attack. Retaliating to that is not unreasonable.", "I'm not sure why everyone on reddit seems to believe that people will only talk about  the person being celebrated 100% of the party. I have literally never been to a celebration where other people's personal lives were not brought up.", "Lol", "Exactly!\nThat's  why I said by itself, this would be fine. But when put in context, he's clearly just lazy and entitled", "O.p. wasn't the jerk. \nThe guy acted inappropriately. A party for your s.o. isn't the time or the place to talk about your personal problems. All of those thongs, coupled with the guy's behavior at the party, show that he's selfish and self-centered, entitled, and a leech.", "I used to babysit for a Native American lady who seemed like she was a perpetual student. She\u2019d study for x degree and get x far before deciding to switch majors and study something else and might switch majors again after getting far. At one point she got a degree, started working only to quit and go back to school.\n\nHer schooling was free because she had a high enough percentage of Native American blood. I will admit that I wasn\u2019t fond of her habit of switching majors seemingly at the drop of a hat.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right.  I forgot about the hypocrite part\ud83d\udc4d", "Right, I was agreeing with you but wasn\u2019t clear!", "So someone probably asked the guy what are you doing for school next semester or how is your major going.  The topic of his schooling was going to naturally come up therefore the topic of his parents not paying was going to naturally come up.", "No problem, I've goofed up in posts before. Thanks for acknowledging.", "Oh yes, you were clear. I was just expanding. We're good.", "And you learn to deflect that question in order to not take away from your partners celebration dinner.", "It's more than just the school comment. The o.p. cited other things that happened during the dinner. If your s.o. is celebrating something, you don't hijack attention. Grown-up Behavior 101.", "Or perhaps assholes don\u2019t need to make asshole comments and the brief aside would naturally run its course.\n\nLook at the dad jumping in after the OP makes his jerk comments to deflate the situation.  The OPs dad recognized his son was being an asshole.", "Or perhaps someone needs to remind Jack the world does not revolve around him and he shouldn\u2019t be expecting handouts from his girlfriends family. \n\nDad was right to jump in, only to prevent a full blown fight at a special day for his child. I don\u2019t see anything where Dad thinks OP was wrong for what he said though. I\u2019m pretty sure he sees what a leech Jack is and hopes that his daughter starts to see the light as well."]}
