He's got his associates degree at this point, and it doesn't seem like he and his girlfriend are married or even splitting life expenses, so his current status isn't something to vilify or interrogate for any material reason. The sky isn't falling. To see him as worthless or \"dead weight\" is very much elitist, and to chastise him is not OP's place. OP picked a fight when it sounds like this guy was just sharing about what was going on in his own life - he's considering studying abroad, he's unsure what's next for him, and so on. All of his seemingly neutral behaviors were cast in the worst possible light in the post because OP judges him negatively as a person. \n\nIf the girlfriend has a problem with her partner's behavior or his life decisions, she is an adult woman and has full capacity to advocate for her own wants and needs. To pursue conflict and chime in (uninvited and repeatedly) about someone else's life like OP did is not socially appropriate for an adult.", "I'm an office manager at a veterinary clinic. I still paint, so it's not like I never use the degree. I just don't make any money from it. I've sold two paintings in the last four years (not counting family), so I'd say it's officially a hobby, not a career, at this point. My job isn't so bad though. I get to meet lots of animals. Sometimes I even paint them, lol. It is what it is.", "Exactly. People who are highly motivated in life. \nHe won\u2019t hold a candle to any of them.\nEyes will be opened.", "Same here, 5.5 years to finish a 4 year degree because I became severely depressed during the pandemic. It sucked and set me back a lot. I go to one of the best schools in the US, was always a top student, and then it just burned me out like crazy. A lot of my friends who are also 22-23 were affected in the same way. I had two friends spend months in the psych ward. Honestly you\u2019d be surprised how much it affected our generation; I know just as many people who graduated late as on time, and at a top school where the students are not the type to \u201clollygag.\u201d To say it\u2019s a red flag is really insensitive to mental health issues and how detrimental they can be", "I would be the first person to criticize the fact that our system pushes people to \u201cmake a choice\u201d about their life before most are fit to do so, so please save your assumptions and criticisms of me. I asked you a basic question and it\u2019s uncivil for you to attempt to disparage me before you even begin.\n\nYou\u2019re right that it doesn\u2019t make Jack \u201cless\u201d simply because he hasn\u2019t figured out his way yet.\n\nTheres a huge difference between someone not finishing their degree because they aren\u2019t sure what they want to do and have switched majors, and another if they are not making a legitimate effort to achieve a goal. I\u2019m not saying this is a case of one or the other, but you can\u2019t either because the story doesn\u2019t give enough reliable information to know. You don\u2019t actually know if Jacks lack of a degree is because he is finding his way or if it\u2019s because he lacks ambition.\n\nOP called him worthless in the heat of the moment in response to him calling her art degree useless. Does that make him elitist too?", "No shame in that, honestly. Office manager is a pretty odd career for him to try to knock, which is exactly what I suspected. I hope you\u2019re doing well and I really hope your sister doesn\u2019t derail a bright future trying to take care of this guy.", "Best of luck to you if you decide to go back in the future. Sixteen years elapsed between my first college class and my last one, but I finally did it. :)", "My first sentence was only meant to imply that I didn't feel optimistic about changing your views since they seemed staunch. I can see how it could have sounded hostile but that was not intentional. I'm sorry about that. \n\nCan't say for sure about the other guy. I really only know enough to speak on OP's perspective as it is written here in his own words. You asked me to explain what was elitist about the post in my eyes though, and I did. What were your thoughts about my final note re: the sister's agency as a factor in the appropriateness of OP's behavior?", "Now kiss", "I agree, im currently going into my 4th year of community college, still planning to transfer out. Its not easy and can be really rough, so when reading this I empathized and could see where he was coming from. I think it was poor timing to bring this up sure, but everything else and all the treatment towards him for being in his situation just lacked empathy imo.", "When Jack makes a point to turn the conversation to his situation repeatedly, despite the best efforts of others in the social gathering, then he is making it their business.", "Lol 17 downvotes. What a bunch of well-mannered redditors we have on this thread.", "\u201cHey Jack, excited for next semester?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned, my parents can no longer help me and I had planned to study abroad, now my plans are up in the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you have a job by now?\u201d\n\nIts normal to ask people about things, and since this couple had been together for years, his gf\u2019s parents are like second parents to him, so hes going to be honest. Do you really think any human being would like, stand up and announce to everyone what was going on? Read between the lines, brother already dislikes boyfriend and isn\u2019t even attempting to sound balanced.", "It seems Jack didn\u2019t learn his parents\u2019 lesson by bringing it up and keep guilting his in laws to see if he has leverage to get them to fund him.", "The only person he should apologize to is his sister no one else", "There are caps on what you can get and usually it\u2019s 5 years for a 4 year degree", "It\u2019s the worst, I have 7 downvoted because I have the audacity to not shit on a guy for taking extra time to get a degree, like piss off\ud83d\ude02", "Assuming he was just sharing something about his life to people he presumably considers to be like family, YTA. If he was passively asking for money, as some other commentators are assuming, then NTA.\n\nAlso, 23 is young in our (assuming this is the US) culture, and it takes some people a while to get started. I had a bunch of majors in college. I was waiting tables after college and making like 25k a year. Now I\u2019m in my 40s and make several hundred thousand dollars a year. Give the kid a break.", "YTA. Your sister nor the rest of your family had an issue with it so why are you so pissed? He's distraught about his future and you dismissed it as a sob story. Of course it's not the best time to bring it up but sounds like you don't like the guy. You were unnessarily confrontational and rude, it's so obvious that you overreacted. Some people change their majors and it takes them longer, it's ok. It's crazy how you think a 23 yr old guy is worthless because he doesn't provide. You thought he was taking the spotlight from your sister so you decided to create more drama? You're weird", "Also dad changed the subject. Probably because she was being a prick and he didn\u2019t want it to get any more awkward.", "And as Ive mentioned in several replies, if he had 5 years of school so far, covid hit during his sophomore year and took away his full junior year. His \"senior\" year was likely his first full year of real school since he was a freshman. SINCE 2018.\n\nSource: I had my graduation (circa 2022) on youtube sitting on my couch wearing nothing but my graduation robes (unzipped) and eating scrambled eggs. My partner now works in higher ed and she still sees the repercussions from covid", "How did you come up with that based on the info we have? This is pure delusion", "Yeah, it took me 7 years to complete a 4 year nursing degree but I also had 3 medical leaves of absence during that time. It looks bad on paper but there's a legitimate reason it happened that way. This guy just seems to be slacking with no direction.", "We don\u2019t want him. Speaking for every country that he isn\u2019t in.", "The guy has no funding for either his ambition to complete his degree or to study abroad. What are his responsible solutions beyond getting a job? What is the appropriate response to an adult who lacks money for what they want to achieve?"]}
