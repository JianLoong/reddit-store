She has been dating \"Jack\" (23) since high school. He has been in college for five years now, changed his major twice and only has an associates. We were having a dinner to celebrate my sister, and my whole family was there. Jack decided to tell everyone at my sister's dinner that his parents told him they wouldn't pay for his schooling anymore.\n\nMy sister started to comfort and reassure him. It pissed me off that she had to do that at her own party. I told the boyfriend I could help him with his resume, but he said he didn't need to work on his resume since he didn't have his degree yet. I asked what exactly his plan was, and he said he didn't have one yet.\n\nI changed the topic to my sister's upcoming trip she's taking with her friends. Jack then uses this to transition to talking about how he wants to apply to study abroad but is not sure how he will pay for it. I said I've always found the best way to make money is with a job. He glared at me, and my dad changed the topic.\n\nAfter dinner Jack came up to me and asked if I had a problem. I said I didn't appreciate him tainting my sister's event with his sob story about how he couldn't get a four year degree in five years. He said I was a hypocrite with a useless art degree that doesn't even use my degree in my job. I said that's irrelevant because I *have* a job and he should probably fucking get one too, because my sister is a student and can't afford to carry his worthless ass.\n\nHe called me a self-righteous prick and left. I've been thinking about it, and I think I overreacted, and I could have just blown him off and not talked to him when he came up to me. I doubt cussing at him is going to convince him, so I probably shouldn't have done that.", "created_utc": 1690641444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ctvgh/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_boyfriend_he_should/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His announcement was out of place.\n\nYou offered to help him, and then changed the subject. Bf chose to bring the attention back to himself.\n\nYour talk with bf about his behavior was after the party, in private. You did not over react.\n\nBTW: your art degree isn't useless, because it is a college degree. Most jobs specify the need for a college degree but don't care about the major.", "NTA. Sure you didn't under react?", "Definitely NTA! I would've been the same way honestly. He needs to grow up and get a job if he wants to pay for something he wants to do. I can't believe he tried to diss you too! Many people have jobs that don't relate to their degree.", "NTA, art degree is pretty useless and you proved that by having a job nothing to do with your degree and thus wasting, presumably, your parents money. But, as you said. Irrelevant.   \n\n\nYou're not wrong that he tainted your sisters day by making it all about him, and youre right in that he should get a job if he wants to study abroad etc. Hopefully your sister wises up to the type of guy he is, seems like he isn't able to stick to things and is very indecisive. Plus a bum.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t know where you live, but in the U.S., it\u2019s not even remotely unusual to take more than four years to get an undergraduate degree, and changing your major\u2014something a lot of people do\u2014can mean new prerequisites.\n\nHis timing may not have been great, but it sounds like he\u2019s dealing with a major financial issue. You could have been more compassionate by saying nothing.", "YTA. It\u2019s none of your business what he does in life, he\u2019s not your boyfriend. And you just proved yourself a hypocrite by criticizing him for not using his degree when you yourself didn\u2019t use yours. Again, not your money or your life so it\u2019s none of you business nor your responsibility to scold him like you\u2019re his mom. If your sister has issues with it, that\u2019s her problem. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re forcing yourself into his personal business when you aren\u2019t his girlfriend", "YTA and you're also a snob.", "NTA - you're sticking up for your sister's best interest.  Had Jack not pivoted the celebration to him (selfish), it never would have happened.  He appears very entitled and selfish (at least in the way it was portrayed in this post), so calling him out wasn't a bad thing!", "Can I call you a righteous AH?? I mean yeah, you escalated and came at him. But god it sounds like he needed to hear it. And your sister sounds like she's looking through rose tinted glasses, thinking all the red flags are just flags. \n\nGood on you for standing up to your sister. I'd be really curious to know what your parents thought? Did they think he was an ass? Were they secretly happy you knocked him back? \n\nESH (but also yay!! Good for you!!)", "NTA his parents are tired of his shit. Your sister should drop that anchor before he pulls her down.", "NTA\nYou did not overreact. \n\nHe was selfish in diverting attention from your sister to himself. Red flag.\n\nHe refuses to work. Red flag.\n\nHe's taking a lot of time to finish his degree. Red flag. \n\nHe's rejecting any actual help so that he can continue to play some sort of victim. Red flag. \n\nHe obviously was fishing for money. Red flag.", "Sounds like you were pissed off at Jack for doing the same thing you did, cause a lot of drama at your sisters party. ESH", "You could have handled this better at least in my opinion", "YTA.  Even if jack needed to heat that message, it was a dick move to hijack your sister\u2019s party as the forum to tell him that. I assure you, you tainted your sister\u2019s event far more than he did.", "NTA. He definitely seems like he\u2019s hoping for a handout. Pretty inappropriate of him to bring that up when you guys were celebrating your sister. He should get a job. Millions of people have gotten jobs while in school to help pay for their education. And considering study abroad when he has no funds for his education? Lmao", "YTA\n\nYou were hostile to him first repeatedly, then he wanted to talk to you about why you treated him that way, and you were even more aggressive, so then he became aggressive back.\n\nYour sister's family (which includes you and his parents) might become his family in the future too. I think it's ok if he wanted 30 seconds to talk about his parents no longer paying for his education and to get some emotional support or a listening ear. He might marry your sister in the future and become your brother-in-law!\n\nYou were hostile and aggressive towards him, but I get it, you don't like that he has taken 5 years and still only has an associate degree, doesn't have a job, and is still working on completing a 4-year bachelor's degree. Your sister just got into med school, so I get that you probably don't think he is good enough for her. But she is the one who gets to decide on her own life partner.", "NTA.\n\nHe's clearly trying to steal the spotlight by doing this:\n\n>Jack decided to tell everyone at my sister's dinner\n\n>Jack then uses this to transition to talking about how he wants to apply to study abroad but is not sure how he will pay for it.\n\nWhat's he trying to achieve by talking about it again and again at a party that was meant to celebrate your sister?\n\n>I was a hypocrite with a useless art degree that doesn't even use my degree in my job.\n\nA degree is better than no degree.\nA job is better than no job.\n\nNTA at all mate. Her boyfriend is a piece of work.", "y\u2019all both seem sensitive as hell", "YTA", "Two inappropriate assholes. I'd say E S H, but your sister and father, and others appear to have behaved reasonably throughout. \n\nYes, the BF is a whinging, party-dampening soul-suck of a self-centred human in his behaviour at the party. No dispute. I'd bet he's unaware of just how much of a soul-suck that behaviour truly is.  \n\nYou, OTOH, appear to have chosen your language specifically to confront. Knowing it's a celebration for your sister, you decided it's appropriate to respond with slings and arrows instead of simply shutting it down. And you could have shut it down.\n\nBoth of you need a reality check. Neither his entitlement nor your contempt needed to be present in the moment. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And apparantly never had to work so this is a huge and maybe even very sudden change.\n\nHe is emotinally charged and you poked until he was set off basically.

At least I couldnt, no matter how hard I worked. So the bf's concerns are genuine although his timing is a bit sketchy. Was he hoping for pity money?", "bro he hardly even has a degree, which his parents paid for, he has no plan moving forward and he\u2019s whining about not being able to afford it when he has made zero effort TO afford it himself all at his own girlfriend\u2019s celebration party. he is TA", "The final conversation happened privately, so my parents don't know about it.

He kept moping about not having money.

Personally, if I was the one being celebrated, such as when my friends had a celebration dinner for me, and if another friend was going through something - I would want the friend to feel comfortable bringing it up so that we can give her/him emotional support too. It doesn't take long and I would want my friend to feel better.", "I agree mate. But in this context Jack did try to get a degree but changed majors twice and couldn't get it in the end. Tough luck for him but he didn't have to look down on someone that does have a degree and call it useless. He just comes off as jealous and petty.", "Jack is a loser.
