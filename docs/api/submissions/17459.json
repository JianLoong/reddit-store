I\u2019d wear that all day. I\u2019ll be like, finally, someone recognizes that I\u2019m special!", "NTA. She was being a Karyn. You did a kind gesture and the kid\u2019s day probably would of been made with that sticker.", "NTA.  Someone must have put sandpaper on her toilet seat that day.  She was just looking for a reason to be grouchy or was just having a bad day, or something.  People in the supermarket gave my kids similar stickers in the past, and I always knew they were just being friendly.  Plus, my kids loved getting them, lol.", "NAH (with an asterix)\n\nYou are not the ahole giving a sticker - it was meant as a nice thing.\n\nI don't think mum was the AH **only** because it could be that the kid does have some form of disability. It could be that others have used \"special\" in a derogatory way. It could be that they only just got a diagnosis and it's still raw. Or she could just be overly sensitive.", "NTA, kids love stickers. \n\n(also, I'm assuming here you're confused about why the parent was upset: special gets used as an insult with reference to special education aka classes for people with primarily learning disabilities)", "NTA. That Mother SUCKS. Kids Love STICKERS. Source. Have Kid. Kid Can Read. Kid DOES NOT CARE WHAT IT SAYS. It will be stuck and torn off in less than a Jeopardy episode.", "NTA. Her perspective is that that term is (often?) used as a euphemism for children dealing with cognitive and physical challenges (which in and of itself is not insulting anyway!). But I think it was pretty clear you didn't intend it that way and your coworker is correct: some people are just A.H.s", "NAH", "NAH but a misunderstanding\n\nYou understood 'special' to mean a good thing.\n\nThe mother understood 'special' in the sense of 'special ed.' \u00a0= learning disability, she saw it as a slur.", "I think she's just upset that she didn't get a sticker too. NTA", "NTA\n\nCoworker nailed it. Some people are just assholes.", "NTA. Our son has been already diagnosed with speech delay and we will see what will be final diagnosis, he's to small so he might grow up from it as late bloomer, might be slightly on autistic spectrum. He's definitely quirky non \"standard\" child. I would laugh my ass of if he cames with sticker like that. \"Yes kiddo, you are special\"...Love him the way he is.", "Well.... you do know what is usually meant by a child 'being special', right?", "NTA  kids like stickers. If you gave them a price tag they'd probably be happy. Mom seems like no joy to be around", "NTA. You were obviously not labeling the kid.", "I used to give stickers to cool kids when I worked in the butchery department of a supermarket.\n\nI\u2019m going with NTA but I can see how a parent may be offended if they are over protective of their offspring.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Last time, I thought to offer them to the adults as well, and they were all so happy to take one! Adults deserve stickers too :)", "My kid likes to collect stickers and put them all over her drawers.

Any opportunity to cause a smile, laughter, or even a snicker should be seized upon. Kudos to that counselor."]}
