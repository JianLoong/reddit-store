When he came home we learned he has been leaving and coming back before we do to collect the cash. Also got the kids to lie, I am extremely pissed. So he can\u2019t pay us back since it\u2019s over a 1000 bucks that he doesn\u2019t have. \n\nSo he has to at least babysit for free 10 times to make up the money or get a job and pay it all back.

Basically they'd game the grading system by scoring high early on, then not give a fuck later on in the year and get OK grades.  Their average in the end would still be good enough to maintain their grades and ranking.  A lot of AP kids even collaborated together to do homework and tests for efficiency; (for tests some were brazen enough to talk in code).  It got to a point that teachers adopted a new policy where if they had proof of \"coasting\", and they'd warn us every year, if they had proof you were, you'd fail.

Some parents (like you) are just terrible in how they punish. Do you think the money will make him see the consequences?\n\nThere is no way to reasonably calculate what amount he cheated on so this entire punishment about paying back money is a dick move.\n\nFind another non-monetary way to punish him like showing him documentaries about accidents which happened with unsupervised kids.\n\nYou greedy people seem to be more concerned about being cheated out of some money than about making the kid learn something.\n\nYTA", "I don\u2019t know - I feel like if there were a fire in the house, the 16-year-old would be more likely to be rational and get all the kids out.

Seriously.", "Plenty of people go to college and work part, if not full, time. 5 AP courses are way easier than actual college courses. He can make it work, his school work will be fine.

And that should be part of the punishment anyways.", "I took a lot of AP classes too. When I was your son's age I got arrested and was given 100 hours of community service.

The 100 hours definitely didn't come out of my school time, I just didn't see my friends for three months.\n\nI may have gotten arrested, but I didn't ENDANGER CHILDREN.

Someone could have literally died because he decided to be irresponsible. As parents, you have to give some kind of consequences for that, and limiting it to him paying back the money he effectively stole from you is incredibly kind on your part. In most households, that kid would be lucky if he was allowed to leave the house/have a phone/play a videogame at any point between now and his 18th birthday, getting a job is tame af XD", "NTA, but you're causing your own problems.\n\nYou can't force kids to do jobs they don't want to do and expect it to go smoothly.

You are making him \"pay back\" some of the money. He chose the punishment. For me, the kicker is him making 8 and 10 lie for him. That's the dealbreaker in the trust relationship.

He needs to know there are consequences to cheating your employer.\n\nNTA", "AITA Think you are asking a kid to look after kids. Hugh ask. The lying is one thing that should be addressed. He is stupid and does stupid things. He is young. Look at things from his perspective. He might just miss the money. It was a job, fire him for failing to preform that job and make that clear. Yes he needs to learn about work.", "NTA for the punishment. \n\nThe bottom line is that your son stole from you. In ANY other job, if you get paid for a job and you don't do it, that's fraud/theft/whatever. Just because he is your son doesn't mean that it should be swept under the rug, as he will learn that this is okay. He's 16 -- FAR too old to think this is okay. \n\nYou gave him a choice on how to pay you back, and he is the one that chose to do the babysitting. I am not sure what your aunt thinks is unfair about this. I would recommend checking in to see if she has the full story, as opposed to him crying that \"my parents are forcing me to babysit my siblings for free!\" \n\nHowever, if he has already proven to you that he is not responsible, I would be very careful as to whether or not he might do the same thing, or something similar, like ask a friend over to watch them instead.", "NTA, and I\u2019m going to agree with many here and say the punishment should be get a job and pay it back. You should also explain that if this were to happen in the real world, that\u2019s a criminal offense (embezzlement) and he could end up in some serious hot water.\n\nMe, I don\u2019t pay my 17 year old an hourly rate to watch her 10yo twin siblings. None of my kids get an allowance or charge me for any chores. I ask her to watch them and that\u2019s that. But I also pay her phone bill, car insurance, gas money, etc. I don\u2019t mind giving my kid\u2019s spending money if they\u2019re going somewhere.

I doubt that any 16 year old would go along with being forced to work, if anything they would say \u2018okay\u2019 and then go hangout with friends while you think they\u2019re working.", "Making this the punishment puts your kids at risk. I agree that he needs to be punished, but sticking them with a resentful teen who has shown a complete disregard for their safety I think is a HUGE mistake. \n\nYTA", "NTA, but your remediation plan doesn\u2019t sound good. No longer permit him to babysit, even for free, and make him pay you back by getting a job outside the house.", "You seem hung up about the money. I would be hung up about leaving an eight and 10 year old without any supervision. That\u2019s what I would be concerned about. \n\nI like the idea of him not babysitting anymore because he broke the trust.", "Free babysitting?! So ready to come down on one way but after hearing it definitely NTA. He scammed $1000 from you. Glad you're making him get a job outside the home where if you actually skip work they fire you.", "If you commit fraud and get caught, you should have to make restoration. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't trust him to babysit again, so glad to see edit. Plus he will see just how good a gig he had before he fucked it up. \n\nYounger kids probably need some kind of punishment here too, 8 and 10 is plenty old enough not to lie about something like this. Not saying go medieval on them, I know how much power and older sibling can have, but this should be addressed too.", "NTA. Get cameras. \n\nAn 8 and 10 year old are okay on their own after school but isn\u2019t ideal but if they have a way to communicate with an adult, it\u2019s generally fine. You have to be the judge of your own kids though.", "Perhaps three kids is extravagant?", "ESH. Maybe you should pay someone who is trustworthy though, because if he wouldn\u2019t even watch them for 20/hour, what do you think he\u2019ll do for free? Even less.", "YTA - kid already left them alone. 100% would have him scrubbing the toilets and doing laundry or whatever else before I have him watch my other kids again.", "My other concern is he got the younger two to lie.  That\u2019s something you don\u2019t want the younger kids doing as someone could put them in danger and they might think it was okay to lie to their parents.  Parents need to discuss it with them and possibly punish them for the lying.  Obviously it depends on how brother got them to lie, bribe, threaten, etc. can\u2019t punish them if they were threatened.", "He also shouldn't be allowed to pick his \"punishment\", Like doing what you were paid for is punishment? \"Fine, I pick babysitting because getting fired for not doing my job might show up on my employment record.\"", "[removed]", "Read the post, trigger happy.

That's like the easiest job in the world - and he still couldn't do it?  Maybe you should make him get a minimum wage job so he can realize how good he had it before he broke your trust.  Nip this entitled behavior in the bud.", "A lot of kids that age spends some hours alone after school, and that is after getting themselves home. It just depends on the country and the individual kids. \n\nSo while the 16 yo was in the wrong (collecting money he did not ear, getting the littles to lie to the parents etc), it's unfair to say he left his little siblings in danger unless they are too irresponsible to be left alone or the area is dangerous.", "When he was supposed to be babysitting, he was able to go out and blow money. Could have spent most of that time studying at home, unless 8 and 10 have particularly special needs. \n\n\nAlso, the \"punishment\" (ie: reasonable, natural consequences) can be modified. He can get a job. He can work regularly, and pay you the money he owes. Even if he literally takes home $50/week, that's half a school year. But if he's working hard at his job, and working at academics, but seriously struggling, you can always modify the agreement. Let him quit and pay back the rest with a summer job.
