When he came home we learned he has been leaving and coming back before we do to collect the cash. Also got the kids to lie, I am extremely pissed. So he can\u2019t pay us back since it\u2019s over a 1000 bucks that he doesn\u2019t have. \n\nSo he has to at least babysit for free 10 times to make up the money or get a job and pay it all back. He was pissed but chose the babysitting. We will be randomly checking in with him during it.

So I came for this subreddit\n\nEdit: Some of you made a really good point, he is getting a job and not babysitting. Even if we check on him the trust isn\u2019t there.
