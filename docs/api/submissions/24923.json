Basically they'd game the grading system by scoring high early on, then not give a fuck later on in the year and get OK grades.  Their average in the end would still be good enough to maintain their grades and ranking.  A lot of AP kids even collaborated together to do homework and tests for efficiency; (for tests some were brazen enough to talk in code).  It got to a point that teachers adopted a new policy where if they had proof of \"coasting\", and they'd warn us every year, if they had proof you were, you'd fail.

You sound really judgemental \"Just dont go out\". Ew.", "Yeah, let's mess with my child's education because he was a teenager and made a teenager choice, if a job will mess with his education then that makes it YTA, you don't mess with things like that. Make him work off the debt in chores and not babysitting like yard work and shovelling snow raking the yard. Hell even washing the car. As long as it doesn't mess with his education.", "NTA", "Call forwarding would be my concern.
