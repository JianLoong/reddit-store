It absolutely 100% sucks. I asked for their help renting a room elsewhere and they refused because \"we have 2 empty guest rooms; take your pick and save us money.\"\n\nThey started seeing e/o when I was 17 and it hasn't gotten any better. I just try to avoid them as much as possible, but it doesn't work because they are always yelling at me over dumb shit.\n\nFor example, the SO walked into my room to tell me something and then started lecturing me for how messy it was and how I needed to get my hair out of the sink and shower drain. The SO has also yelled at me to sleep at 11:30 PM because I need to be in the office by 7 AM for work.\n\nAdditionally, last week, I got sunburned and when I came back and tried to put some aloe vera on the burn, I was lectured for not wearing sunscreen and \"how dare I be so careless when they had to cut out 10 skin cancers last week?\" Like for Pete's sake, take a chill pill please?\n\nWhat's the worst above all is that somehow, my 15 year old brother is super buddy buddy with the SO. To CLARIFY, my 15 y/o brother doesn't live with my parent and their at all; he lives with my other parent and visits us during school and summer breaks as my parents live 6 hours away from each other.\n\nHOWEVER, my brother and my parent's FaceTime and call every other day and I have no idea why, as I can't even stand talking to the SO for longer than 2 milliseconds.\n\nI demanded that my brother tell me why he is so close with this person for no reason at all and he said, \"Because she's chill, hilarious and fun to talk to and we have a lot in common,\" which I call BS on because I am super chill and close with my bro and yet can't stand this lady at all.\n\nI told him to please see the light, and somehow that information was divulged to my parent and their SO and now I'm in hot water with not just my parent and their SO but also my other parent.", "created_utc": 1667573717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym15bu/aita_for_telling_my_sibling_to_please_see_the/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
