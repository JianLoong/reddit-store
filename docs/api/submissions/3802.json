She felt that waxing enough to where you were at a point of having finer, often lighter, hair growing in more slowly from retarded follicles was more economically manageable for most people- especially since you can learn to do it at home. \n\nShe was correct. At that point I had already paid through the nose for 6 sessions for my face and 5 sessions for my armpits. I\u2019m still happy with the reduction on my face, but it never did fully remove all the hair.

The only removal process that is closest to being permanent is electrolysis, and even then hormones shifts can activate dormant follicles and cause you to need to go and get those fried, but at least that is super targeted and less irritating/sensitizing to your skin. If you get to a point with the at-home ipl that you\u2019re mostly content, I\u2019d just stick with that, or supplement in a bit of waxing. I\u2019m looking into an at-home ipl, but also trying to save for potential electrolysis($$$$). Oh, and consistent waxing for a while did retard my armpit follicles way more than the laser did, with the regrowth still much less to this day.", "It might be this that smells so bad. My freshman college roommate had 3 abortions over the semester, which would be fine (if irresponsible), had she changed the little trash can under her desk where aborted baby blood was chilling on used pads. By the end of the year I was doing everything I could not to sleep in my dorm room, and my mom visited and sprung for a hotel for me the last week of school after she walked in and gagged.\n\nIt is a special kind of rancid metallic smell.", "You are correct. Idk what culture this bs is from then.", "I know, I've been there. I was not allowed to renew a lease when my depression was at its worst because my apartment could have been featured on hoarders. I would also argue that's not high functioning even though just like you, I was in college and working on my bachelor's. Someone who hasn't showered in 4 months isn't high functioning. If we were talking about a few days, even a week, sure, but we're talking about 4 months of built up stench. Regardless, it doesn't change the judgment,", "I got so grossed out by her description my high ass almost down voted \ud83d\ude02 I had a friend who almost always smelled fishy and would not shower more than four times a month and she had a steady boyfriend and I do NOT know how he did it \ud83e\udd72", "I don\u2019t care what people use if it works. My Dad had an allergy to many scents and used that crystal thing- he re-applied a couple times a day and was fine.\n\nAlso, it drives me crazy because baking soda, cornstarch etc are all chemicals. Also breast cancer runs in my family, and aluminum and deodorant doesn\u2019t cause cancer.", "Our bodies are made up of chemical molecules down to its DNA lol"]}
