Not dormitories, but private apartment complexes that lease to college students. You don't always get to choose your roommate in these sorts of apartment complexes. It's more like, they're renting out rooms in apartments.", "I put up an add and she was the best choice. Granted, i didn't know about her wash fobia", "Irrelevant when it begins affecting others to this extent.", "They don't but i have a bunch of stuff in my room to make it smell good because boy.... Ain't good otherwise", "Lack of hygiene to that degree is a really concerning sign that points to mental health problems.  Does she have family that you can call?  She's at the age where most mental illness strikes.", "Not the culture spin lol. \n\nI know some cultures and people are less likely to wash daily than others, but even that usually means they shower every 2-3 days, not never in months. Gross", "We had a co-worker that was transferred to our enclosed office (cash office, department store), she wore nice clothes, jewelry but she stank so bad, she made it worse by dousing herself with perfume, so she stank of body odor and perfume, if I stood next to her I would hold my breath but it didn't help much. It was explained it was a culture thing but the stink was unbearable, I don't remember how long she was in our office before being transferred out but one day in our enclosed office for hours was too much, I just remember how awful the smell, because it was the cash office we had no windows to air out the room.", "It's not a culture thing.  I honestly think she has some kind of mental disorder.  Someone needs to contact her family.", "The fact that that was her reaction instead of, you know, just showering is killing me lol.", "Then call her a stank ass female dog right back. She sounds like a nightmare to live with. Kick her out and tell her to go stay with the people who are giving you a hard time about throwing her out. See how long THEY put up with her funky behind spreading her stank all over THEIR house.", "But did she wash her ass?", "Bad hygiene can be a sign of anxiety or severe depression.", "Maybe she often gets bit by dogs on these runs and has hydrophobia?", "She's culturing something for sure... A full world of it, like the dudes in the locker from MIB. I'm hitching just from reading this post.", "vinegar tends to work really well as well as vodka! just buy some cheap stuff, put it in a spray bottle and it usually works good, tho i will admit i have never tried it for 4 month long nasty hygiene", "I NEED to know what she said after seeing this post its eating me up lmao", "I call BS on that. WTF is the \u201cculture\u201d she is claiming it goes against? Definitely NTA. Roomie has serious mental issues.", "What culture?", "What hobo culture?  She's a dirty ass liar.", "That's horrible. Idk if they still make them but Oust had these little automatic fans that really helped me. That and Ozium. Lots and lots of it", "I\u2019m sure bacteria is all over her body. And I thought my son smelled bad during puberty.", "omg i didn't even think of her periods,,, ewww", "My mom had a coworker like that. She referred to the smell as \u201csweet booty\u201d", "THIS!", "Same", "I had a dog growing up and she never smelled", "Pinesol too. Leave a bowl out", "Had an ex who was an alcoholic. He showered but didn't believe in deodorant. That was fun in 35C 100% humidity weather...", "I think it\u2019s the opposite. Most people need deodorant.  Almost every person I\u2019ve met who has said they don\u2019t need deodorant smells bad.  Unless you\u2019ve got the ABCC11 gene you should definitely wear deodorant.", "And the stench would abate, but, it never did.", "And these people saying you\u2019ll interfere with her studies as well; how is anyone able to sit next to her in a lecture ?! I\u2019m baffled it hasn\u2019t been addressed on campus.", "You should have just taken a hose and sprayed your housemate down lmao", "Something might've been wrong then more than the deodorant..", "Is that the dry earwax gene? My husband has it, and genuinely never stinks. I surreptitiously sniffed him before we dated because I knew he biked to work and all I smelled was clean laundry. Me, I gotta wear anti-persistent, or my pits will stink.", "Agree! Those saying deodorant is unnecessary most likely reek.", "I'm saying they don't need it every single day for most, not that you don't need it at all. If someone's room is nauseating it's not showering.", "Something that lives / grows in a petri dish.", "You need a combo of genetics and a healthy diet and minimal substances to smell good without deodorant. \n\nMost people who don't wear deodorant aren't usually taking care of themselves great in other ways which makes their body odor worse.", "Yupppp!  It\u2019s mostly East Asians that have it.  My Korean friend has no body hair and no bo.  I however am a smelly hairy Sasquatch.  I\u2019m very jealous of her for that.", "Don't forget the extra towels and bathroom products.", "Even showering with water would help.", "if she actually care about cleanliness/hygiene, showers with water twice a day probably will help to wash the odors away. But it's been months, it's time for soap. I guess she just doesn't care about hygiene.", "Now I'm jealous of her too. I take hidrogymnastics classes and SOMEHOW I manage to sweat my forehead so abundantly that it gets in my eyes and burns, I live in constant war against my hairs everywhere (they don't allow dogs in the pool, so I'm very careful, don't want to be chased with a broom only for them to find I'm actually human and not a massive poodle) and I forgot deodorant only ONCE in my life and it was traumatic enough. \n\nYou and me, the cursed sasquatch sisters \ud83d\ude2d", "only if after being served an eviction notice the tenant does not leave. 24 hours to 20 days is the time frame that's legally required based on province and what infraction was the cause of said eviction notice."]}
