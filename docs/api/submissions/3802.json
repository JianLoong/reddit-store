Seriously if it's that bad then no NTA in anyway shape or form.", "NTA.  What does Christmas have to do with this?   If the woman stinks so bad that everyone is offended, then she has to go.   What disease might be caught from someone's lack of hygiene?", "NTA.\n\nLet her stay 2 nights with anyone who thinks you are being inconsiderate.", "NTA. This young woman is horrible.

Hopefully this will be a learning experience for her. You are not responsible for how long the landlord gave notice for.", "NTA\n\nDo these friends actually hang out with her? Invite them over and see how they feel then. The timing isn't great, I'll grant, but in a lot of areas with the layout of semesters it seems like it actually would be good timing depending on when the term ends. I bet if you did as they said and waited another month they'd come up with some other excuse for you to keep suffering.", "NTA - you spoke with her about it on multiple occasions, eventually gave her an ultimatum, and when she didn't change her behavior, you followed through. \n\nYour roommate might require some mental health support - this is pretty extreme behavior. Are you in college too? Consider consulting with the health services team about ways you might connect her with support. The student's association at her college might be able to help her find alternate housing, too. Good luck.", "NTA, and that\u2019s beyond disgusting. You did the right thing.

It's a really shitty situation because yeah, asking for her to be evicted is insensitive, it seems she has some kind of mental health problem if her hygiene is that terrible, but you can't live like that and you did try to discuss it with her and made it clear this was your next step, so she shouldn't be surprised.", "NTA. So gross. She deserves it.", "Nta", "You're NTA for being disgusted or expecting a roommate who takes care of herself but if she's on the lease with you she can't be evicted without you being evicted. It's impossible to evict just one person on a lease, everybody on the lease is legally the same entity. And the landlord can't just \"throw her out\". That would be an illegal eviction. You have to go through court to evict somebody. There is probably a mental health element to this as well.", "NTA you are not evicting her, the landlord is.", "There is a literal mental disorder people have that  they don't bath. Later for her", " She's lived here for 4 months and she never showered . Add the morning runs..... She smells really bad", "It is that bad. She's lived here for 4 months and she never showered .

OP is doing her a favor lol", "They came over and complain about the smell once . Never put foot in my apartment after that", "She says it's a culture thing", "I had my friends over once and their reaction was \"wtf is that smell? You live here?\" Safe to say they never came over again.", "Yes i am in college but it's not a mental issue she says it's her culture the stops her from washing.", "My friends came over once and never again. Reason? The smell.", "She says is a cultural thing to not wash", "I'm the one on the lease since I've been here for 4 yrs. She signed a living agreement with me.

Lol", "What culture doesn't partake in hygiene exactly?
