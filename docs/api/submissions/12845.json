My sister, Angela (24F) was born addicted to substances, so she ended up living with her grandparents. We were raised more like cousins than sisters and have never really been close. My mom and I moved around a lot and I rarely saw Angela, but when I did, she was usually unpleasant to me. She got a lot of things I didn't (college fund, summer camp, new car, etc.), and she made that clear.I left home when I was sixteen and Angela was nine and we kept in contact for a few years but eventually fell out of touch. We only reconnected after our mom's death, approximately 3 years ago, and even now we only talk every couple months. \n\nAngela ended up becoming a mom pretty young, and she has a three year old son named Peter.  She has been on and off substances for years and is not able to support herself. Her grandparents have cut contact with her for the most part due to her lifestyle, and she has been moving from boyfriend to boyfriend since her son was born. A couple days ago, I got a call from Angela for the first time in almost eight months, saying that her boyfriend is in prison, and she is being kicked out of their apartment since she can't pay the rent.\n\nShe says her grandparents aren't answering her calls and begged me to let her and Peter move in until she can find another place. I absolutely don't want this. My wife and I currently have two children   \n(5 and 2), and I can't have that lifestyle around them. On top of that, my wife struggles with health issues, and I am a caretaker for her as well as our children. I do not want to be a caretaker for Angela too. I told Angela this, but she said that she and Peter were going to have to live in a homeless shelter if I said no. Other than her grandparents, I am the only family they have.  \n\nI don't want Peter to suffer for something he didn't do, so I agreed that he could come live with me until Angela got on her feet. Angela became very upset when I suggested this and said that I was trying to separate her and her son. She has not spoken to me since then, even though I have called multiple times to make sure she is okay. I don't know where she is right now or what is happening. I love my sister, but her moving in would disrupt my whole life.

If that person is an addict, that's just another good reason not to want her around your young family. Your life is important.

Many, many people wouldn't even be willing to do that.\n\nYour first job is to protect your children, and Angela has not proven herself to be a safe person to have around them. Your offer to protect her son from homelessness and from her lifestyle is incredible.\n\nI hope you continue to keep an eye out for him, even if she declines your help right now.\n\nYou may be able to find outside resources involved to intervene in Peter's situation. At only 3 there's still time to make sure he doesn't follow your sister down this road. She would be mad, but...that little boy needs help.\n\nSend you all the good thoughts.

When my BIL was in jail, he wanted his drug-addicted gf and their son to stay with us. We refused her but said nephew could stay, which they declined, saying the same thing as your sister. If she wants to keep her son out of a shelter, she'll take you up on your offer and figure out something for herself.", "NTA. It's a really sad situation for all involved, but you are reasonable to have boundaries against having an addict in your home, and it was kind of you to offer to house and care for her son. I'm sure she hates the idea of separating from her son for any period, but taking it in the direction of 'you're trying to separate me from him' as if you have some agenda here speaks to her mental health more than anything. I hope she'll take you up on it...obviously a three year old is better in a caring family member's home than a shelter.", "NTA  \nI don\u2019t think you are an asshole for putting your own family first. It sounds like this would not go well at all. I think it was very kind to offer to take your nephew in, but it sounds like your sister is not interested in what is best for him, but what is best for her.  \nI would try to find out why the grandparents have cut contact with her. Do you know why her bf is in jail?", "Nta you did what right for your family and offered to protect her kid she choose not to choose her child well being over her own that on her", "NTA. It sounds like Peter really needs a stable home life and you can provide him with that. Even if your sister doesn't see it right now, I hope she comes to understand and agrees to have him stay with you. Really hope things work out that way, OP", "NTA\n\nVery tough, but is what it is.  If this is about her son and not her, she'll let him stay there while she finds somewhere else to crash.  I understand her resistance, I couldn't imagine being in that spot.\n\nYou don't owe them anything.  You're trying to help.  Maybe it's not enough, but it's what you're willing to do.\n\nWouldn't it be nice to have a more stable social safety net?", "NTA.\n\nGiving your nephew some true stability and consistent care is a huge undertaking, and I applaud you for suggesting this to your sister.\n\nAs for your sister, she needs a serious wake-up call regarding her lifestyle choices. I would tell her flat-out that she needs to quit the drugs and learn how to be an adult before you become a real part of her life. IMO, she's not reading the situation she's in correctly, and doesn't understand how close she is to losing her child to CPS. \n\nTalk to her as if you were her mother. You are her older sister, so you would be correct in taking this tone. \n\nSubstance abuse is brutal, and your nephew's early life continues to be brutal. Is he in school yet? All of this moving from one unsure situation to another must be tough.", "NTA, your offer to house her son was a generous one. It's sad, but you cannot let an addict into your house. You need to protect your wife and kids.", ">I can't have that lifestyle around them\n\nWhat specifically can you not have around them? Is your sister currently using substances? Is she still associating with people involved in whatever the BF did to land in jail?\n\nI'm not saying take her in, but I am saying you seem to be making assumptions.

And when you talk about her \u201clifestyle\u201d that\u2019s the fallout from an addiction that she had literally no choice over. \n\nStill NTA, but I think there are some unfair things going on in the way you think about your sister, and probably also in the way she thinks about you. She likely sees you as the lucky one who got to live with your mom, and bragged about other things to compensate.\n\nEdited to add : based on my paragraph above I also suspect that the thought of being separated from her son is even more upsetting for her than it would be for the average parent because she was separated from her mother", "NTA.

You weren\u2019t born addicted to drugs, I\u2019m assuming since you would have mentioned it, which makes it less likely you\u2019d become addicted later in life. \n\nI don\u2019t say any of this because it means you should take your sister in.

So they should let multiple kids live with an addict? And endanger those kids? And possibly kill them? They should enable an addict by proving to her that she doesnt have to care about anything or should change because her family will always help her out at the end When she fucks everything up? They should put pressure onto the SICK wife and husband CARETAKER to always have an eye on the kids to be sure that they arent in danger because of her? They are also expected to deal with an addict in general in their home?
