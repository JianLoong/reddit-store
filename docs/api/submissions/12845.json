She got a lot of things I didn't (college fund, summer camp, new car, etc.), and she made that clear.I left home when I was sixteen and Angela was nine and we kept in contact for a few years but eventually fell out of touch. We only reconnected after our mom's death, approximately 3 years ago, and even now we only talk every couple months. \n\nAngela ended up becoming a mom pretty young, and she has a three year old son named Peter.  She has been on and off substances for years and is not able to support herself. Her grandparents have cut contact with her for the most part due to her lifestyle, and she has been moving from boyfriend to boyfriend since her son was born. A couple days ago, I got a call from Angela for the first time in almost eight months, saying that her boyfriend is in prison, and she is being kicked out of their apartment since she can't pay the rent.\n\nShe says her grandparents aren't answering her calls and begged me to let her and Peter move in until she can find another place. I absolutely don't want this. My wife and I currently have two children   \n(5 and 2), and I can't have that lifestyle around them. On top of that, my wife struggles with health issues, and I am a caretaker for her as well as our children. I do not want to be a caretaker for Angela too. I told Angela this, but she said that she and Peter were going to have to live in a homeless shelter if I said no. Other than her grandparents, I am the only family they have.  \n\nI don't want Peter to suffer for something he didn't do, so I agreed that he could come live with me until Angela got on her feet. Angela became very upset when I suggested this and said that I was trying to separate her and her son. She has not spoken to me since then, even though I have called multiple times to make sure she is okay. I don't know where she is right now or what is happening.

Help how you can while not letting her live with you.", "It sounds like OP is concerned primarily about the well-being of everyone under 10 who would be affected by Angela moving in. \n\nI have relatives more stable than she is that I would not have taken in when my own kids were that young, because it wouldn't have been good for one or more of my kids to have those particular people living in the same house with them.", "Very valid", "Maybe. Or maybe she's crashing at a friend's, or sleeping rough, or hopped a bus to a different town entirely.\n\nIf she shows up at the shelter with a kid in tow, if there is danger the shelter will call CAS. But until OP has at least some idea, it's just wasting their time", "It feels like you\u2019re trying to argue that the difficulties of a child who was exposed to drugs in utero with a stable childhood is at a greater disadvantage than the child who was raised by the same woman, who was actively using and did not provide a stable environment. Please forgive me if I\u2019ve misinterpreted your argument, but this just isn\u2019t something I can agree with.", "Not at all, but thank you for seeking clarification. I am arguing that we are lacking crucial info about whether Angela truly had all the resources (treatment, recovery,~ therapy, et al) she needed to overcome her addictions, so it's not really fair for folks to assume she's just being lazy. I'm not comparing OP to Angela. Just that we need more INFO.", "If she was born addicted, the hospital would gave detoxed her. There would not have been treatment and recovery for her. Therapy would be an issue that we don't know about. But it's not like she stayed at addict from birth through childhood. It's not so much that she needed help overcoming her addictions when she was with the grandparents so much as her needing therapy to process all her ACES. Regardless, it's not OPs responsibility to provide for that now. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, do not let this person into your home.  Aside that your plate is full, she\u2019s still making terrible choices.  I\u2019d even hesitate to take in Peter knowing she\u2019d try to weasel her way in.  \nI think it was good you offered to take him but her reaction just shows she wants to use you.\nGood luck.  Tough situation", "NTA:  she\u2019s made her choices and has to live with them.  Her son hasn\u2019t made any choices (he doesn\u2019t have any power).  You made the correct decision to offer to her son but not her.\n\nYou could try CPS, let them know you are willing to welcome her son in your home.  They may have resources that you do not.\n\nI am not surprised she isn\u2019t answering her phone, it has likely been disconnected if it hasn\u2019t been paid.\n\nI am sorry for your sister.  I have cared to drug addicted infants in the nursery.  They suffer tremendously as they withdraw", "NTA!", "NTA. I think it\u2019s generous of you to offer to take your nephew. Absolutely stick to your guns on this. Angela has brought this on herself. Under no circumstances should you enable her by letting her stay with you. Her grandparents already understand this.", "NTA I was in Angela\u2019s shoes not the substance stuff but the homeless with a child part, and I see her side and yours you aren\u2019t obligated to house people who would bring drugs into your home no matter what the circumstances and I get her desire to not be separated from her child but you gave her a choice she can have him stay with you and visit until she\u2019s in her feet or they can go to a shelter and I have lived in shelters with my daughter and people with kids get priority over single people so much so that she may possibly get a lot of help from the government through the shelters resources so as bad as it sounds her keeping her child with her at a shelter may actually be her best option as much as it sucks I hope she gets the help she needs and that someday she\u2019ll understand and you guys may have a better relationship then", "NTA\n\nYou can't risk your own children for your sister even if you were like twins and very very close let alone.a sister you're not close too\n\nYOUR KIDS COME FIRST ALWAYS\n\nYou offered to take nephew if she put her kid first she would've accepted\n\nNTA", "Call CPS on someone you don't even know the location of? They can't track down someone who doesn't have a permanent home and house hops. For all anyone knows her sister may be dead off somewhere from an overdose or in a situation with some bad people. When a woman with a kid is on the streets on there own, a lot of people will try to exploit both the woman and child. A lot of people also get trafficked that are in that vulnerable of a state.", "Unfortunately, brains exposed to substances in utero are never going to work as well as brains spared that. Angela likely had many struggles due to this. I'm a therapist who works with kids- my kids who have in utero exposure are my saddest cases- lots of impulse driven behaviors, struggles with cognitive function and not responsive to many standard parenting approaches. Parenting them is parenting on hard mode.", "I totally get that, which is why I'm not arguing that OP should take Angela in. I just think the way OP refers to her is a bit harsh", "Yep. This is very critical- impulsive behavior often is part of having in utero exposure, along with poor working memory. I'm a therapist and work with kids and my in utero kids are so tough- sweet kids, but hard to help and hard to parent. Angela likely had poor chances from the get-go and sadly, I'd bet her kid has had in utero exposure as well if family patterns hold.", "[removed]", "\"Separate me from him\"? Who are you referring to?", "Her ACES score is definitely up there. But again, I'm not arguing that she is OP's responsibility. I just feel bad for her, cause she got a shit lot in life", "NTA", "What struck me is the mention from OP that \"Angela had a lot of things I didn't\" , while Angela was probably envious of the sister who got to live with their mother. \n\nBoth children were dealt bad cards, but sharing their mother's lifestyle probably served as a deterrent from bad choices for OP while Angela couldn't help following her example.", "u/Elctronne350 is a comment stealing bot. Original by u/owls_and_cardinals", "NAH. You offered something reasonable considering your own situation.\n\nBut she also responded in the way I would expect someone who was separated from their parent(s) at birth to react when someone suggests they leave their child behind.\n\nSince you weren't close you likely have no idea how it affected her to grow up with two old people instead of a parent. It doesn't surprise me she turned you down and the no contact/loss of trust seems within expectations too.", "Considering she was taken from her mom, yeah, I\u2019m sure that was touchy. And painful to hear and register that she\u2019s making the same mistakes. NTA.", "Nta if she moves in it's probably going to be a long time before she moves out junkies always have this victim mentality and a horrible sense of entitlement where they'll try emotionally manipulate you so they get their way...she can go to a shelter and get on welfare and secure housing maybe even get a job", "I swear some people will rather let their kids suffer then temporarily leave them in a better place until they get their lives together. \n\nI can only imagine how hard it would be to separate yourself, but letting your own selfishness/ego get in the way instead of trying to put your kids in a better situation even temporarily is crazy to me.\n\nI don't have kids so I can only imagine choosing to be in a situation like that and how hard it would be.....", "You are wise not to want someone on substances around your wife and children. You did a generous thing offering to take her child. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAt all. That is not something you want your children around and you have the right to say no.", "True....", "Do you think 1 month is enough time especially for someone who's on and off?", "Wait what was their comment, because if their point is the sister should be shown sympathy for her current circumstance then they are right. The sister was BORN ADDICTED TO DRUGS. And it looks like nether the mother or grandparents did anything about that. Show OP take his sister in, NO he's right not to. But a lot of the comments seem to be glossing over the born an addict thing. I mean the sister has never had a heathy or even normal brain chemistry."]}
