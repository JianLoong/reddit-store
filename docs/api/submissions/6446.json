He\u2019s grown up with basically just me and a small apartment for the first year of his life, and we\u2019ve both bonded more than I ever have with any other pet; we both love to go on motorcycle rides, me driving and him riding in a backpack pet carrier. Just like when I come home, when I pull out the backpack he\u2019ll give an excited squeak and run over to me. Recently my girlfriend, who also has a new kitten, has moved in with me. She also loves her kitten, would never do anything to hurt it, like me, or scare it ever.\n\nI would say my girlfriend takes a very soft motherly approach to raising her kitten, and I would say I take a more firm fatherly approach to my cat Leo. The problem, to my girlfriend, comes when I greet my cat. After work I\u2019ll come home and, in a playful tone, say various phrases to Leo like \u201cHey Leo! Have you gotten significantly more obese since I\u2019ve last seen you?\u201d (He\u2019s still very slim, and more active than ever with the new kitten in the house.) Or \u201cSup Leo. Do anything productive for society today? No? Didn\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite fat bitch today?\u201d \u201cYou run into a wall while I was gone? You look significantly more ugly.\u201d Various, rude phrases, but always said and meant in a friendly, happy manner to my cat.\n\nMy girlfriend always gets so upset at this though. Like, genuinely angry that I am insulting my cat and \u201cbullying\u201d him. I know pets can learn their names, can learn words and phrases, but I tell her that Leo would not understand English to such a degree to be saddened by these greetings, especially when presented in such a happy manner. And it\u2019s not the swearing that annoys her, she swears at things more than I do. She just gets genuinely offended when I direct it towards Leo, and angry that I find these interactions with my cat so amusing.", "created_utc": 1672814208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102wbx1/aita_for_verbally_abusing_my_cat/", "score": 549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was at my lowest, I was very sensitive to tiny affronts. My low self esteem would force my mind to do all these mental gymnastics until I was taking something normal and twisting it into something either directed at me, or a part of someone\u2019s deeper personality. If your girl struggles with insecurities, it might be causing her distress hearing you say those things. It can be jarring for someone in that state to hear negative things in their loved ones voice. I was always so worried that I was ugly, stupid, overweight, and that everyone was just too nice to tell me. Hearing a trusted, beloved partner voice my insecurities, even though they weren\u2019t directed at me, would give me a knee jerk response. \u201cIf they\u2019re saying those things then they think they\u2019re bad, and I think I am those things so they must secretly hate me. I bet when they\u2019re talking to the cat, they\u2019re actually talking to me.\u201d It\u2019s illogical, not true, and no amount of affirmation would fix it because it was all me. I was the one that couldn\u2019t handle a normal situation, but I didn\u2019t have the self awareness or mental fortitude to recognize what was happening. I could be 100% off base here and your GF is just weird and doesn\u2019t want you to hurt a cats feelings, but I doubt that. we all know in our human brains that I could call an animal \u2018useless dumb ugly idiot\u2019 all day and they wouldn\u2019t know I was insulting them. I don\u2019t have any advice because it\u2019s a her problem. If she is insecure that way I am assuming (again, could be wrong!) she is the only one who can change, which comes with a looot of hard work. Worth it, but it\u2019s not easy.

If she did understand any language, it was English not German\n\nMy mom got so mad at us when she learned what it meant ... but then after she had her own place and took the dog back she had forgotten what it meant and started using the nickname because the dog loved it.", "I used to sing a song to my cat (Whiskers) that went \"Whiska is my babyyyy and he's really fat!\" He used to be a big chonk but as he got older he slimmed down quite a bit.", "[removed]", "Lol! I love this!", "We would always ask our dog if she wanted to be eaten for dinner and she would get super excited. She also really loved the name \u201cGrover Cleveland\u201d for some reason. OP is NTA, animals are dumb and they don\u2019t understand what words mean, just the tone and what context the human uses it in.", "I tell my cats I'm going to put them in the stew pot.", "Orange cats and bearded dragons share the same braincell? This would explain so much.", "We just got two siamese kittens (a bonded pair). We named them after a pair of cartoon villains because they are little shits. They will entangle themselves in your legs (I once went down like a bag of bricks - no injuries), jump on your back when you're looking in the fridge, knock every single thing off shelves. We call them all sorts of horrible names while we cuddle and spoil them to death, and tell them if they do it again we're going to throw them out the window. They really, really don't care.", "I always felt cats have a British accent\ud83e\udd23", "Why use word when meow do trick?", "Who knew all cats were French?", "Well if the gf thinks a cat is the same as a child she probably shouldn't have either.", "> I'd guess\n\nI'd stop.", "He keeps telling us to build a wall between us and the neighbours.", "I had a Pom years ago who was convinced her name was Dammit Darcy! because she was the wildest puppy in the world. It became a huge joke for my entire family and she was the most beloved little dog ever.", "I call mine \"mutt\", \"dog\", \"fatty\", \"fat boy\", \"beast\", \"puppy\". My husband tells him he has a girth certificate and it's just round. He also asks the dog what he (the dog) will tell the vet when she asks him why he's so fat.", "Yeah that\u2019s my impression of how they learn words. I use the Towelie voice from South Park and shake the cat nip. Now I don\u2019t need to shake it bc they come running when I say \u201cyou wanna get highhhhh?\u201d \ud83d\ude39", "Same!!", "I think the bot posted to the wrong post! \ud83e\udd23", "Now I understand why it seems so rare that my orange cats get their turn with the brain cell.", "Cats can sometimes learn to understand words in a very limited way, if a certain word is always spoken in a certain situation (Pavlov response). So the cat might learn that \"fatty catty\" means \"I won't give you food\", because /u/partofbreakfast always says it when they won't give her food.\n\nBut she can't connect \"fatty catty\" to \"I'm being fat-shamed\" because she doesn't know what fat-shaming is.", "My cat Al's full name is Big Al Bubba Butthead since he acts like one much of the time since he is a cat.", "From another Australian: same.

We've just started the new food. We're on the \"mix it in slowly\" phase. But the problem is, I have 4 cats, whom I've been talking about on this thread. Spike the beautiful dumbass, Bella the evil genius, Mimi the geriatric tortie grande dame, and Merch, the massive tabby who has the build of a feline John Cena and will destroy any food put in front of him. So we're currently in the stage where Mimi will gingerly pick out the \"good food\" and then Merch just comes along and hoovers up the rest.\n\nIn a few weeks if she's not eating it, I'll try something different."]}
