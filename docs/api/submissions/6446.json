He\u2019s grown up with basically just me and a small apartment for the first year of his life, and we\u2019ve both bonded more than I ever have with any other pet; we both love to go on motorcycle rides, me driving and him riding in a backpack pet carrier. Just like when I come home, when I pull out the backpack he\u2019ll give an excited squeak and run over to me. Recently my girlfriend, who also has a new kitten, has moved in with me. She also loves her kitten, would never do anything to hurt it, like me, or scare it ever.\n\nI would say my girlfriend takes a very soft motherly approach to raising her kitten, and I would say I take a more firm fatherly approach to my cat Leo. The problem, to my girlfriend, comes when I greet my cat. After work I\u2019ll come home and, in a playful tone, say various phrases to Leo like \u201cHey Leo! Have you gotten significantly more obese since I\u2019ve last seen you?\u201d (He\u2019s still very slim, and more active than ever with the new kitten in the house.) Or \u201cSup Leo. Do anything productive for society today? No? Didn\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite fat bitch today?\u201d \u201cYou run into a wall while I was gone? You look significantly more ugly.\u201d Various, rude phrases, but always said and meant in a friendly, happy manner to my cat.\n\nMy girlfriend always gets so upset at this though. Like, genuinely angry that I am insulting my cat and \u201cbullying\u201d him. I know pets can learn their names, can learn words and phrases, but I tell her that Leo would not understand English to such a degree to be saddened by these greetings, especially when presented in such a happy manner. And it\u2019s not the swearing that annoys her, she swears at things more than I do. She just gets genuinely offended when I direct it towards Leo, and angry that I find these interactions with my cat so amusing.", "created_utc": 1672814208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102wbx1/aita_for_verbally_abusing_my_cat/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend needs to lighten up and grow a sense of humour. We currently have a 7 month old cat, who is a bit of a terrorist, like they are supposed to be at that age. I regularly tell him that I'd whoop his ass for biting my toes, if it weren't for the fact that his ass is so tiny that I can't find it. Guess what? He couldn't care less. And I love him to bits!", "NTA your saying it in a playful tone so the animal will not know what your saying to it at all lol. As long as the cat seems to still love ya your good ha", "NTA he's a cat- they understand tone and volume and will recognise specific words (if I say \"pets\" or \"cuddle\" my girl is in my face in an instant purring like a motor) but do not understand when you insult them in a normal voice.", "NTA \n\nI have many derogatory names (said affectionately) for my cats.", "I have a friend whose mother dealt with the frustrating, colicky sleepless nights of her infancy by cooing softly to her:\n\"Does my sweet girl want to go to the orphanage?

I do believe that animals, especially cats, understand more than they get credit for, but a lot of that comes from the tone of our voices and HOW we say things. Check out the \u201cBilli Speaks\u201d videos on YT.)\n\nI even jokingly threaten to \u201cbeat your butt\u201d when they get into mischief, but I would never hit or intentionally hurt my cats. And I would physically fight anyone else that tried.", "You, too, banter with your cat! It's a mark of great friendship to lovingly take the piss out of someone and let's not pretend that cats wouldn't say worse things to us lol. They can pick up on tone, so he definitely knows whatever you're saying is being said with affection - if he's listening to it at all! \nSounds like you make great effort to give him a happy, exciting life and he loves you too, but I had to laugh when you specified that you drive, not the cat. Have you never let him try?\n\nNTA, but if there's a cat in motorcycle photo, that would really cement my decision.

Your girlfriend isn't worried that you're hurting your cat's feelings; she's worried that someone she loves can say mean things in a humorous tone, and is probably unsure if this means you insult other people in your life the same way.\n\nI'd guess she's probably got some other trauma or concerns related to past verbal abuse (of her, or someone she cares about). It's not a big ask to change the kind of nonsense you say to your cat, and while it's your choice, consider: it's a small amount of work that will probably put her significantly more at ease around you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
