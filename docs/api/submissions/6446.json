He\u2019s grown up with basically just me and a small apartment for the first year of his life, and we\u2019ve both bonded more than I ever have with any other pet; we both love to go on motorcycle rides, me driving and him riding in a backpack pet carrier. Just like when I come home, when I pull out the backpack he\u2019ll give an excited squeak and run over to me. Recently my girlfriend, who also has a new kitten, has moved in with me. She also loves her kitten, would never do anything to hurt it, like me, or scare it ever.\n\nI would say my girlfriend takes a very soft motherly approach to raising her kitten, and I would say I take a more firm fatherly approach to my cat Leo. The problem, to my girlfriend, comes when I greet my cat. After work I\u2019ll come home and, in a playful tone, say various phrases to Leo like \u201cHey Leo! Have you gotten significantly more obese since I\u2019ve last seen you?\u201d (He\u2019s still very slim, and more active than ever with the new kitten in the house.) Or \u201cSup Leo. Do anything productive for society today? No? Didn\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite fat bitch today?\u201d \u201cYou run into a wall while I was gone? You look significantly more ugly.\u201d Various, rude phrases, but always said and meant in a friendly, happy manner to my cat.\n\nMy girlfriend always gets so upset at this though. Like, genuinely angry that I am insulting my cat and \u201cbullying\u201d him. I know pets can learn their names, can learn words and phrases, but I tell her that Leo would not understand English to such a degree to be saddened by these greetings, especially when presented in such a happy manner. And it\u2019s not the swearing that annoys her, she swears at things more than I do. She just gets genuinely offended when I direct it towards Leo, and angry that I find these interactions with my cat so amusing.", "created_utc": 1672814208, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102wbx1/aita_for_verbally_abusing_my_cat/", "score": 1475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was at my lowest, I was very sensitive to tiny affronts. My low self esteem would force my mind to do all these mental gymnastics until I was taking something normal and twisting it into something either directed at me, or a part of someone\u2019s deeper personality. If your girl struggles with insecurities, it might be causing her distress hearing you say those things. It can be jarring for someone in that state to hear negative things in their loved ones voice. I was always so worried that I was ugly, stupid, overweight, and that everyone was just too nice to tell me. Hearing a trusted, beloved partner voice my insecurities, even though they weren\u2019t directed at me, would give me a knee jerk response. \u201cIf they\u2019re saying those things then they think they\u2019re bad, and I think I am those things so they must secretly hate me.

I was the one that couldn\u2019t handle a normal situation, but I didn\u2019t have the self awareness or mental fortitude to recognize what was happening. I could be 100% off base here and your GF is just weird and doesn\u2019t want you to hurt a cats feelings, but I doubt that. we all know in our human brains that I could call an animal \u2018useless dumb ugly idiot\u2019 all day and they wouldn\u2019t know I was insulting them. I don\u2019t have any advice because it\u2019s a her problem. If she is insecure that way I am assuming (again, could be wrong!) she is the only one who can change, which comes with a looot of hard work. Worth it, but it\u2019s not easy.
