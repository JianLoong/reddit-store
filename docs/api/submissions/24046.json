I work for a famous news corporation; I won't say the name for privacy reasons. I'm contracted to work 40 hours a week full-time but sometimes I will work 60 hours a week. The hours are mainly 9 to 5 but sometimes you'll have to work the odd weekend or do some night work. The 60 hours can include travelling to and from places all over the country and getting all necessary jobs done as you can't take it home with you (I will explain why in a bit).\n\nAt work there was an unexpected meeting, if there's an incredible meeting, something significant is happening, and it will be a busy time. As I was in the panel, we were informed of the work that was about to happen and that the result would last x amount of days and the first draft must be in by y date. As it was an important project, the boss said that anyone who has any upcoming annual leave needs to push it back a bit. We were informed of the deadline and that's where my sister and nephew come in.\n\nMy nephew's first birthday is on the 19th of August when the deadline is. Because it was on a Saturday my sister, we'll call \"Katrina\" (31F) and her husband \"Daniel\" (31M) decided to throw a first birthday party on the day of his 1st birthday as it was the weekend. I had some annual leave from the 19th to the 20th, but it had to be pushed back to meet the deadline. Once I got home from work, I called my sister to explain the situation. I told her that an important project had come up at work, and we'd been asked to postpone any annual leave before or on the deadline. I informed her the deadline is on my nephew's first birthday, and I can no longer make it as I shall be at the office working.\n\nSister asked me if I could work from home by bringing the laptop to her place and position while attending my nephew's first birthday. Firstly, that's not a good idea. Secondly, I explained to my sister that the work laptop and phone of the news corporation have to stay inside the building unless we're staying overnight somewhere for work and that our phone must stay on so they can track us for our safety (Most news corporations do this). We're not allowed to take them home. \n\nAfterwards, my sister called me names, bitching and moaning at me. She then went on Facebook and did a long post about how I'm not coming to my nephew's 1st birthday. Her best friends, \"girlfriends\", as she called them, were saying I'm nothing but a complete asshole, and her reply was to agree with them. I don't see what the issue is as it is his first birthday and there's loads of birthday to come, plus he won't remember his first birthday. I think I may be the ahole here because she's upset that I'm not going but then I wonder if she's over reacting.

Most first birthday parties are really parties for the parents.", "NTA. I can't stand it when people act like someone's job is just some cute little hobby they do for fun and can blow off at any time with zero consequences. It's not (for most people). It's literally your living. I would be tempted to ask your sister if she'd be willing to financially support you if you became unemployed. Maybe that will keep her quiet.", "NTA. The party is for the child, who will not have a clue as to who is there.  Your sister is an ass.  Send a gift to shut her up and do your job.", "NTA. You have work commitments that easily come before a birthday for someone who will never remember it. They are acting like little brats.", "NTA. My kids grandparents haven\u2019t come to parties simply because they got great flight prices for that weekend for an adventure. But they come see them whenever they can and that\u2019s what counts. Sister should get over her self.", "Sorry, but she's the AH here, not you. She acts as though your inability to make it were a mortal sin. \n\nIt isn't It's work, it's your living, and, as you point out, the infant won't know what's going on, anyway.\n\nOn the contrary, she thinks this is HER birthday do, and you're flouting her demands that you be there or else. She is entitled and narcissistic and if I had a sister who did that to me, I would go NC on her till she repented of her selfish attitude. \n\nThis demented lashing out at even close relatives who can't be at someone's beck and call is just outrageous.\n\nNTA.", "As a journalist who works for a news corporation, NTA. Clearly you don't WANT to miss the party, and I can only imagine how important the story is for people to drop everything", "NTA. I know that a kid's first bday party is a very big deal, but your sister went way too far with the attacks. \n\nOn a side note, you might want to consider looking for a new job. Shit like this will happen again and you will find yourself being alienated by your family/friends.", "NTA but your decision is worth thinking about. At the end of the day, would you rather do your job or be a beloved part of your friends\u2019 and families\u2019 lives? My Dad is like you. He loves his job, he\u2019s good at it, and it\u2019s beneficial to society as a whole. But he never hesitates to take time off for big family events. You can do your job any day, but you only have one shot to give the people you really care about your full love and affection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
