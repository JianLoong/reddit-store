The role was well paid but focused on providing the practical side to the theoreticals that they learnt at Uni. They were given one day off per week to attend Uni, and more during exam season. After a few inconsistencies, I did a bit of digging on one trainee. It turned out he had faked his college attendance, and actually never started the course at all despite being accepted. He lied to everyone on site and spent his day off playing video games. This was nearly two years into a three year program. He had to be walked off site because otherwise the site men, who'd done his work on his days off and supported him feeling\"stressed out\" by study, would have beaten the crap out of him. He was taken into a meeting and given immediate dismissal - which is a very rare thing in the UK. It was fraud and gross misconduct and I still have no idea how he expected to function after the traineeship ended and he was in no way prepared for the role after.", "Sounds \u201cpro corporation\u201d\u2026?
