I have asked the shops around and they all said that he's a stray, and he always asks for food from them as well. I decided to post about him online and managed to find someone who is willing to adopt him.\n\nOn the day that I was supposed to bring the cat to the new owner, the security guard at my place made a scene and yelled at me about how he wants to keep the cat there to chase away the mice. I asked if he ever feeds the cats and he said it was none of my business (although judging by how hungry he is everytime I feed him I can tell the security never feeds the cat, and I never see him feeding the cat ever). He was adamant about not letting me take the cat.\n\nWhen I left work at the end of the day, the cat followed me to where I park my motorbike, which happened to be away from the security's sight. I took the chance and put the cat in the carrier, and drove him to his new owner. \n\nMy colleagues who left after me said that the security was not happy, and he kept using bad words to talk about how I took the cat away, claiming that even though he doesn't own the cat, I have no rights to take him away. \n\nAm I The Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679060074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tra5x/aita_for_sneaking_a_stray_cat_away_from_the/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He probably has already imprinted on you.", "You can never be an asshole for rehoming a neglected animal.", "NTA. He said that he didn't and doesn't own the cat. There were no signs of him taking care of it. No one mentioned it belonging to the company. \n\nThe guard just liked the fact that the sustenance hunting the cat had to do to stay alive made his job easier.  How cruel.", "NTA all day long.

Hunting cats are not normally ravenous.", "NTA. You did the right thing by finding a good home for this cat. The security is an A H. If he is so worried about mice then there are other ways to get rid of them. Heck he did not even feed this poor cat.

The cat is MUCH better off having a home now. I'd go tell that security guard off.", "The security guard was being a real asshole. If he had said he fed the cat and showed you where he kept the water dish, then you wouldn't have taken the cat.\n\nAt the same time, I'm not sure that you should have given the cat to some random person on the internet without checking into that person. At your workplace, the cat had his space, he had his feeding (through you) and wasn't being used as a bait animal. There was no pressing need to re-home the cat. I don't know how much checking you did on the new owner.\n\n(BTW, all feral cats eat quickly so the food gets 'et before the raccoon shows up for his portion.)\n\nI really don't know how much checking you did on the new owner you found on the internet, so I can't make a judgement at this point.", "If the cat was an effective mouser he wouldn't be hungry. \n\nSo the cat was doing nothing productive. The security guard is just... Let's just leave it there.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I say this because there is value in giving a properly feral (but still spayed and immunized) cat a chance to play mouser in an industrial/agricultural building/area. Because that kind of cat doesn't want too much/any human contact. It's more of symbiotic relationship.\n\nBut a cat who is friendly and is not truly feral and lacks the instinct to mouse should be homed asap.", "You deserve congrats.", "NTA The cat needed a home. I bet the security guard did nothing to care for him. Just ignore him.", "NTA.   The cat is better off having a home.
