I asked if he ever feeds the cats and he said it was none of my business (although judging by how hungry he is everytime I feed him I can tell the security never feeds the cat, and I never see him feeding the cat ever).

If he had said he fed the cat and showed you where he kept the water dish, then you wouldn't have taken the cat.\n\nAt the same time, I'm not sure that you should have given the cat to some random person on the internet without checking into that person. At your workplace, the cat had his space, he had his feeding (through you) and wasn't being used as a bait animal. There was no pressing need to re-home the cat. I don't know how much checking you did on the new owner.\n\n(BTW, all feral cats eat quickly so the food gets 'et before the raccoon shows up for his portion.)\n\nI really don't know how much checking you did on the new owner you found on the internet, so I can't make a judgement at this point.", "If the cat was an effective mouser he wouldn't be hungry. \n\nSo the cat was doing nothing productive. The security guard is just... Let's just leave it there.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I say this because there is value in giving a properly feral (but still spayed and immunized) cat a chance to play mouser in an industrial/agricultural building/area. Because that kind of cat doesn't want too much/any human contact. It's more of symbiotic relationship.\n\nBut a cat who is friendly and is not truly feral and lacks the instinct to mouse should be homed asap.", "You deserve congrats.", "NTA The cat needed a home.
