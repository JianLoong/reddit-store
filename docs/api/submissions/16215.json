Of course, she was understandably upset. We talked about this, and the main reason she was upset was because it felt to her like I didnt include her in my decision, and that I was super impulsive. She also told me that it hurts not being able to have the capabaility of traveling with me. I told her that I understand, and I\u2019m sorry for being selfish, but I wanted to take this urge to travel solo even though she couldn\u2019t come. I also let her know that we can travel to other places in the future when circumstances allow us to.

For example, if in the times you\u2019ve talked about Japan with her in the past she has also said it was her dream to visit there, then you\u2019d be an AH.

You are your own person and can make that choice. You do not need her permission to use your money or your leave time to do something nice for yourself.\n\nAre you in some way neglecting your relationship to go on this trip? Are you choosing to do this instead of a more affordable trip that you both would go on, or are you using up your leave time so you won't be able to spend time off with her?

Japan is not that expensive if you travel wisely.\n\nWhen I had been together with my now husband for one year he paid for an 8 months long trip to 11 countries in South East Asia. He wanted me to join, I was a broke student doing my thesis and said yes, I want to come, but don\u2019t have the money. He just paid.

But had no interest. I also spoke about that Japan trip for ages. So he was not included. Oh yes, a few weeks before he started with \"If you really want to have me he will come with me\". But I did one of this \"If you want to have me\" vaccations with him and it was a nightmare. So I decided to let him stay at home and fullfill my dream instead to drag around somebody who has no interest in visiting Japan and want to have for each step a pad on his head, as he \"is just there for you\".  The vaccation without him was much more fun.", "NTA\n\nYou two are not married. Not everything you do has to be about the two of you.  Understandably she is hurt & you should definitely smooth things over.  \n\nBUT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nThis was something you were specifically planning for yourself, long before her. You always wanted to go. And while it does suck that you took the leap without her, you are also entitled to travel solo. Which I get that. Because you would also have to coordinate the details of the trip with what she wants as well. And sometimes that can cause friction in relationships.\n\nHave you ever traveled with her to other cities? You really should do that before planning an out of Country trip to see how you two handle the details of planning excursions, dining & accommodations.\n\nWhen I was saving & planning to move to California from my old Southern state, SO many acquaintances were hinting at coming with me. One girl blatantly stated that she just HAD to get out of there. And I pointed out that this was MY solo move & that I am not responsible for her desire to leave the State. I told her to save her money & plan like I did.\n\nSo, I feel the same is in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t have to delay something you have always wanted for someone else\u2019s sake. What if she NEVER got the money saved? Or ended up spending it on something else & then still expected you to wait until she saved again.  Or, lied about the amount & you end up footing the bill for both of you in a foreign country? \n\nNah, go have fun.

Kinda like finding Taylor Swift tickets but only one available and snapping at the opportunity.\n\nBut as you read the rest of the post, you are describing you just want to travel to Japan solo and there's other trips you'll be more than happy to take her on. So it really didn't matter if you got a deal or not, acted quickly or not, you wanted this trip solo and from the post it didn't seem that you told her that. OR you lied and created the impression you wanted to go to Japan with her and have since changed to want a solo trip, or used that as justification/an excuse for the solo trip.

Not asking for a permission per se, but just like to make sure if she really won't go with you- something simple like \"I find this ticket here with as much price, and I really want to go. Do you want to join me as well?\" Even if you know she can't, I think it's just a nice gesture to still consider her as well (in this scenario, since you don't really plan for a \"solo travel\" qnd don't seem to mind either if she joins you up).\n\nI read the NTA answers here too, some that giving you their (or relative's) experiences regarding the same case, how the partner doesn't seem to mind it and so on. And of course those are valid too, but I'd like to add that every person is different- what might be okay for them maybe not for your girlfriend. You know her better; you know why she's upset, and I still think that her feeling is valid in this scenario.\n\nShe's not wrong for feeling left out because you did not invite him when the actual plan is really made, but I don't think you're wrong either for wanting to go to Japan nevertheless- especially since after the incident you did try to accommodate your girlfriend as much.\n\nMy suggestion is not to cancel the plan, but talk with her and make sure that you understand and accept each other's intentions/feelings (ot maybe re-invite him once again in case she can arrange things to still join you.

When you're so committed to someone (5 years!) and you decide by yourself to go on a trip that your girlfriend can't afford, instead of making a plan with her to save money and go next year, for example, you show her very clearly that she's not a priority to you. A week long trip to Japan (that you could do at a later time WITH your partner) is more important to you than what your partner wants and more important than travelling and doing things with her.  \n\nI'm in a quite serious and very loving relationship and me and my bf want to be lifelong partners to each other. If something like this happened I'd be devastated, both because I would have really wanted to go, but mostly because it would mean he doesn't care about me as much as I do about him and as much as I want my partner to care.", "So you\u2019d be just fine with your SO of 5 years merrily going off on a vacation you\u2019ve both talked of by themselves?

And the holidays were my birthday or our anniversary holidays. Unless it matched what they wanted 100% I ruined it, despite paying for it all. That's why I'm giving some breathing space to OP.\n\nFrankly I view it now as a healthy thing to holiday separately. I wish I'd insisted on it for myself before recently (do now).

Id be pissed even when my hubs and i were bf/gf not living together if he didnt at least tell me about it before doing it....like....wtf...it isnt even about asking permission...its about sharing his interests with her and maybe even seeing if she wants to go with...or explaining like \"hey...ive always dreamed of this since i was a kid and i kinda just want this to be a me trip...but i wanted to at least talk to you about it first\"", "Yeah, he starts out with it being a purely financial issue, but then ends with \"i just really want to enjoy it by myself.\"  GF was never getting an invite.", "Yeah, I really hope that most people posting on this sub appreciates that a large chunk of commenters/voters don't appreciate nuance and think being a detective means pulling conclusions out of thin air as if Sherlock Holmes could have done that without being written by the same person that created his reality.", "One week.\n\nGood for him. Go for it. Have a FABULOUS trip.", "This isn\u2019t about how long he\u2019s leaving, or if he wants to travel alone.

If they were really cheap, maybe she might have managed to pay for them, too. Or you could have lent her a bit of money or she could have borrowed a bit from her parents or siblings.

I helped him get his stuff together before he left and spent time with him, I didn't call him names or get angry at him.

He has more vacation time than I do, I fully expect him to do a solo trip sometime when I can't go. It's fine.
