I had this intense urge to travel to Japan this year and I was actually telling her to come with me a few times, but she told me that she couldn\u2019t afford to travel to Japan yet. \n\nWhen I got the chance to buy cheap roundtrip tickets, I informed her briefly but I went ahead and booked for myself. Of course, she was understandably upset. We talked about this, and the main reason she was upset was because it felt to her like I didnt include her in my decision, and that I was super impulsive. She also told me that it hurts not being able to have the capabaility of traveling with me. I told her that I understand, and I\u2019m sorry for being selfish, but I wanted to take this urge to travel solo even though she couldn\u2019t come. I also let her know that we can travel to other places in the future when circumstances allow us to. I truly understand where my girlfriend is coming from\u2026 Now i feel really guilty of what I\u2019ve done and I\u2019m thinking of not going anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s really tough for me because of course, I want to share these experiences with her but I also wanted to really pursue this trip for myself, even though I\u2019m alone.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 24M, she\u2019s 25F - together for 5 years now.

Maybe with an actual discussion you and your girlfriend could have found a way she could go with you. Relationships are meant to be a partnership. You discuss and make decisions like this together. You don't just book tickets for yourself and say bye bye I'm off for a few weeks/months.", "YTA.\nNot for wanting to travel solo. That\u2019s understandable, and I know many people who traveled solo even once married. \n\nYou\u2019re the AH for how you went about it and not having a collaborative discussion. \n\n\u201c hey, you know I wanted to go to Japan for years. There\u2019s a great deal right now and I want to be able to take advantage . This is a country I would love to just explore solo since it\u2019s been on my bucket list for so long. Also - I know that right now it\u2019s not a great time for you to be able to join with me. I was thinking of going X to Y. What do you think?\u201d", "INFO: could you have helped her pay for it? I mean youve been together 5 years\u2026 so youre obviously serious?", "YTA. If they're really so cheap then maybe they're cheap enough for her to be able to afford the trip? Or maybe you save enough to be able to help her out with the cost? Or maybe you just wait - Japan isn't going anywhere and cheap tickets will come around again. Agree to start saving maybe. So many better ways of handling this than how you did.  \n\n\"I also let her know that we can travel to other places in the future when circumstances allow us to.\" Circumstances that are now less likely because you've splurged on a trip for yourself?\n\n\"It\u2019s really tough for me...\" Doesn't seem like it was tough at all. You saw the tickets and bought them with barely a second thought.", "YTA. If you\u2019re doing better financially, why didn\u2019t you use your \u201ccapability\u201d to buy her a ticket? And for the love of god, communicate. \n\nAlso, just go on your trip. You probably killed the relationship anyway.", "YTA. \n\nPut yourself in her shoes. You\u2019ve booked this big trip on a whim, knowing that she can\u2019t afford to come with you. You\u2019ve then said that *hopefully* you\u2019d be able to travel to other places in the future, when circumstances allow. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not surprised you feel guilty. And my advice would be to postpone things. \n\nBecause given all of this, are you likely to even enjoy the trip anymore? Or will you just feel guilty the whole time?", "is it wrong of you to book a ticket to your dream trip on an impulse? not necessarily. is it an asshole move to do it without telling your girlfriend of 5 years who has expressed support and a desire to share your life/big moments with you? yeah. you're not wrong to want to take this trip but YTA for how you went about it.", "YTA. You\u2019re been with someone for five whole years and you just \u2026 up and decide to take a week-long trip abroad alone with zero discussions ? \n\nThat\u2019s what single people do. No one in a committed relationship would ever behave this way. Some couples *do* go on solo trips, but there is *always* a discussion.", "NAH\nYour not an asshole at all, you wanted to do something really badly and your doing it. Japan is a beautiful place. I also think you handled the conversation with your girlfriend very well by telling her that you guys can take plenty of trips together in the future. Your girlfriend has the right to feel the way she feels as long as it\u2019s not impeding your life and decisions at the end of the day it\u2019s your life and your money and you can do what you want with it.", "Lol youre going to ditch your gf of how many years to spontaneously go to another country for how long?

I don't get all ytas. You told her already, you have the money. She's maybe jealous and projecting. That's valid but shouldn't stop you from going.

Travel now, as much as you can, while you're young with nothing holding you down and while you have the disposable income! Enjoy!", "If this was a woman booking tickets to her dream destination the comments would be yass queening her decision to the moon and back.

YTA", "YTA. You have been together for 5 years and do this?  Just break up if she\u2019s not important to you.", "NTA - while I understand her being upset you shouldn\u2019t exactly feel guilty. You can travel alone, and while I get she would want to be included and it can be rough to see others get to do things you can\u2019t, that is not your fault.", " NAH. Yeah that will feel tough on her. Feeling \u201ctogether\u201d is part of a relationship, so if this challenges that feeling, I feel bad for her. However no one is an AH.", "I am on the fence here, gonna go with NTA because you told her it's your dream and I understand you mentioned the deal you got. \n\nHowever, from now on, you  have to realize that being with someone might limit these solo travels.", "NAH.\n\nsucks that she can't afford it, but amazing for you! I've always wanted to go too and have heard it's amazing.\n\nAlso my brother did this with his girlfriend (now wife) with Japan also and she didn't care. He also like.. didn't mention it to anyone at all haha. I remember asking his wife to talk to him cause he wasn't answering his phone and she's like 'oh, he's just gone to Japan for a week' ..as ya do.\n\nThey were able to travel together at a later date and have done some amazing things both together and seperately. They're settling down now but I think it's so cool they encouraged each other and experienced so many things prior to settling down.\n\nEnjoy your trip! How exciting.", "NAH, and you\u2019re not an AH at all, assuming you painted a complete picture. For example, if in the times you\u2019ve talked about Japan with her in the past she has also said it was her dream to visit there, then you\u2019d be an AH. But it sounds like she would be up for going, not that it was important to her.\n\nHave fun on the trip.  I hope she doesn\u2019t try to make you feel like shit for going without her.  But if she does, don\u2019t bring her back a souvenir.", "NTA\nYou probably could have gone about this differently but I wouldn't say that following your passions is a bad thing", "YTA since you knew she really wanted to come but simply couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nTaking solo trips in a relationship is fine but you acted pretty selfishly here. You\u2019ve shown her clearly that your priority is yourself and your own happiness over hers, so don\u2019t be surprised when she acts the same way.", "NTA - you have to grab opportunities when you can because there's no guarantee you will be in a position to do so again. It's unfortunate that she can't afford to travel there at this but (it sounds like) you're not married or engaged so you're not spending your (i.e. joint money) on a single trip (i.e. just for you). Unless you're almost engaged or have been together for a good couple of years, she is just your gf. Though you could still go on a special separate trip even if you married, though that would be something to then discuss with your partner.", "NTA. Your GF wants to share those moments with you as well so her feelings are justified. But you finally got a chance to fulfil your dream. You should absolutely go for the trip and enjoy to the fullest.", "I mean you have been talking about this with your gf. She clearly wanted to go with you but it was bit too expensive to her. You could have saved up with her so you could both go together. I get that this has been your dream but you were bit selfish with how you handled this. Just dropped her off.\n\nMaybe you guys are really young and have not been together for that long and then I can understand this. But if you're both working adults who live together then I would say that YTA.", "INFO how long have you been together? If it's only a few months you're definitely not in the wrong. If it's longer you still might not be.", "NAH. You did at least briefly discuss it before getting the tickets, and it's something you've told her multiple times over the years that you want to do. It's sad that she can't go too, but a one week trip shouldn't be a big deal.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to do *everything* together.\n\nThere is something you wanted to do so you did it. You are your own person and can make that choice. You do not need her permission to use your money or your leave time to do something nice for yourself.\n\nAre you in some way neglecting your relationship to go on this trip? Are you choosing to do this instead of a more affordable trip that you both would go on, or are you using up your leave time so you won't be able to spend time off with her? That is the only way that I could see you having at all messed up, and even then only in the limited context of priorities.", "INFO: How long have you been together? Do you live together?", "I saw a similar post recently except the genders were opposite. The guy didn't want the girl to go without him but it was her dream for the longest time. Follow your dream. You can always travel together another time.", "I just don\u2019t understand why when you got this overwhelming urge to travel to Japan this year you didn\u2019t sit down and talk to your girlfriend and make a plan to help her save?\n\nInstead of just spontaneously buying a ticket? I understand taking advantage of the deal but why not buy an extra ticket and have her pay you back when she can?\n\nI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re and AH because you should be able to do your own thing. I do think you\u2019re an idiot in this situation though.", "YTA. Want to travel alone? Fine, do that. But you don\u2019t get to talk about this trip as a partner activity and then act surprise when she is upset that you\u2019re going without her.", "Info: You said you informed her briefly, how brief was it?

I understand that she\u2019s disappointed, but so long as she doesn\u2019t beat you over the head about it, she\u2019s not really an AH (which is why I say NAH instead of NTA). \n\nBut no, you are not an AH either. Solo travel can be awesome, and this sounds like it\u2019s more important to you than it is to her. You can share a similar trip with her down the road, but unless y\u2019all are sharing finances, etc. or you had specifically promised to wait to go with her, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for this.", "YTA.

Japan is not that expensive if you travel wisely.\n\nWhen I had been together with my now husband for one year he paid for an 8 months long trip to 11 countries in South East Asia. He wanted me to join, I was a broke student doing my thesis and said yes, I want to come, but don\u2019t have the money. He just paid. I pitched in 1500 us dollars, which was all I had and he paid the rest. (I don\u2019t even know how much the backpacker trip ended up costing.) \n\nWell, it was a great test if we were working out as couple bc 8 months on the \u201chighway\u201c will def show every side of both parties.   \nIf you are serious with her you need to figure out how to include her. (I started paying 1/3 of  trip costs after I got a job.)", "INFO:  you said that you talked to her briefly before purchasing them, but what was the convo like?\n\n\"Hey there's a great deal I want to take advantage of\" and she said ok? \nDid she ask you to pay and she'll pay you back? \nDid she ask you to go next year with her and she'll save the money?\n\nI feel like that convo changes everything about my vote. \n\nYou're NTA for travelling at all. \nBut you can be an ass if she specifically mentioned a solution for you to travel together and you ignored her.", "NTA - My husband, at that time boyfriend, was capable of paying the trip himself. But had no interest. I also spoke about that Japan trip for ages. So he was not included. Oh yes, a few weeks before he started with \"If you really want to have me he will come with me\". But I did one of this \"If you want to have me\" vaccations with him and it was a nightmare. So I decided to let him stay at home and fullfill my dream instead to drag around somebody who has no interest in visiting Japan and want to have for each step a pad on his head, as he \"is just there for you\".  The vaccation without him was much more fun.", "NTA\n\nYou two are not married. Not everything you do has to be about the two of you.  Understandably she is hurt & you should definitely smooth things over.  \n\nBUT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nThis was something you were specifically planning for yourself, long before her. You always wanted to go. And while it does suck that you took the leap without her, you are also entitled to travel solo. Which I get that. Because you would also have to coordinate the details of the trip with what she wants as well. And sometimes that can cause friction in relationships.\n\nHave you ever traveled with her to other cities? You really should do that before planning an out of Country trip to see how you two handle the details of planning excursions, dining & accommodations.\n\nWhen I was saving & planning to move to California from my old Southern state, SO many acquaintances were hinting at coming with me. One girl blatantly stated that she just HAD to get out of there. And I pointed out that this was MY solo move & that I am not responsible for her desire to leave the State. I told her to save her money & plan like I did.\n\nSo, I feel the same is in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t have to delay something you have always wanted for someone else\u2019s sake. What if she NEVER got the money saved? Or ended up spending it on something else & then still expected you to wait until she saved again.  Or, lied about the amount & you end up footing the bill for both of you in a foreign country? \n\nNah, go have fun. Tell her you are sorry & that this is too big of a trip for a first time traveling together.  Tell her to look at other places and/or Countries that either she can go solo or that you two can go together.", "Info: what does \u201cinformed her briefly\u201d mean?

It was not done to exclude her, she can't afford it yet meaning they will be able to take that trip once she can. OP is not going with someone else, he's not out to party in Vegas for a week, I could be wrong but he's most likely going there alone to eat sushi, watch sumo, check out Gundams and sleep in a capsule hotel. \n\nIf OP's partner knew about this passion and dream, it's ok to be taken aback and because she was not included but, knowing OP's dream, its pretty bad that she didn't understand it and made it about her instead of encouraging OP even if she couldn't make this trip.   \nshe made OP feel bad about it because she is not ready for it financially.   \n\n\nINFO : How did you describe this trip to her?
