She also told me that it hurts not being able to have the capabaility of traveling with me. I told her that I understand, and I\u2019m sorry for being selfish, but I wanted to take this urge to travel solo even though she couldn\u2019t come.

You are your own person and can make that choice. You do not need her permission to use your money or your leave time to do something nice for yourself.\n\nAre you in some way neglecting your relationship to go on this trip? Are you choosing to do this instead of a more affordable trip that you both would go on, or are you using up your leave time so you won't be able to spend time off with her?

Japan is not that expensive if you travel wisely.\n\nWhen I had been together with my now husband for one year he paid for an 8 months long trip to 11 countries in South East Asia. He wanted me to join, I was a broke student doing my thesis and said yes, I want to come, but don\u2019t have the money. He just paid.

But had no interest. I also spoke about that Japan trip for ages. So he was not included. Oh yes, a few weeks before he started with \"If you really want to have me he will come with me\". But I did one of this \"If you want to have me\" vaccations with him and it was a nightmare. So I decided to let him stay at home and fullfill my dream instead to drag around somebody who has no interest in visiting Japan and want to have for each step a pad on his head, as he \"is just there for you\".  The vaccation without him was much more fun.", "NTA\n\nYou two are not married. Not everything you do has to be about the two of you.  Understandably she is hurt & you should definitely smooth things over.  \n\nBUT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nThis was something you were specifically planning for yourself, long before her. You always wanted to go. And while it does suck that you took the leap without her, you are also entitled to travel solo. Which I get that. Because you would also have to coordinate the details of the trip with what she wants as well. And sometimes that can cause friction in relationships.\n\nHave you ever traveled with her to other cities? You really should do that before planning an out of Country trip to see how you two handle the details of planning excursions, dining & accommodations.\n\nWhen I was saving & planning to move to California from my old Southern state, SO many acquaintances were hinting at coming with me. One girl blatantly stated that she just HAD to get out of there. And I pointed out that this was MY solo move & that I am not responsible for her desire to leave the State. I told her to save her money & plan like I did.\n\nSo, I feel the same is in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t have to delay something you have always wanted for someone else\u2019s sake. What if she NEVER got the money saved? Or ended up spending it on something else & then still expected you to wait until she saved again.  Or, lied about the amount & you end up footing the bill for both of you in a foreign country? \n\nNah, go have fun.

Kinda like finding Taylor Swift tickets but only one available and snapping at the opportunity.\n\nBut as you read the rest of the post, you are describing you just want to travel to Japan solo and there's other trips you'll be more than happy to take her on. So it really didn't matter if you got a deal or not, acted quickly or not, you wanted this trip solo and from the post it didn't seem that you told her that. OR you lied and created the impression you wanted to go to Japan with her and have since changed to want a solo trip, or used that as justification/an excuse for the solo trip.

Not asking for a permission per se, but just like to make sure if she really won't go with you- something simple like \"I find this ticket here with as much price, and I really want to go. Do you want to join me as well?\" Even if you know she can't, I think it's just a nice gesture to still consider her as well (in this scenario, since you don't really plan for a \"solo travel\" qnd don't seem to mind either if she joins you up).\n\nI read the NTA answers here too, some that giving you their (or relative's) experiences regarding the same case, how the partner doesn't seem to mind it and so on. And of course those are valid too, but I'd like to add that every person is different- what might be okay for them maybe not for your girlfriend. You know her better; you know why she's upset, and I still think that her feeling is valid in this scenario.\n\nShe's not wrong for feeling left out because you did not invite him when the actual plan is really made, but I don't think you're wrong either for wanting to go to Japan nevertheless- especially since after the incident you did try to accommodate your girlfriend as much.\n\nMy suggestion is not to cancel the plan, but talk with her and make sure that you understand and accept each other's intentions/feelings (ot maybe re-invite him once again in case she can arrange things to still join you.

We obviously discussed it and made sure we were aligned on expectations and timing, but I'm so glad my wife's mindset was never \"you're not allowed to do things without me.\" Because if that were the case I would've never gone anywhere since she also did med school and residency. \n\nI wildly dislike this idea that we are required to do literally everything with our spouses. My wife and are partners, not ants in a hive.", "Haha I'm just saying that direct communication always sounds nice on Reddit but it's not always so simple, especially in relationships.\n\nAnd I wouldn't exactly call this follow-up question the worst case scenario.", "I don\u2019t understand this\u2026you stopped working to accompany your husband who travels for work? Lucky you! But how is this relevant?", "I'd get it if it had been a year or less of dating but after 5 years how can you go on a vacation without your SO just because they can't afford it? OP said he makes more than her. Is it his plan to travel solo for the rest of their relationship every time he wants to go somewhere she can't afford instead of splitting costs based on income?", "But he did speak to her prior, and she said she couldn't go, not she could only go if tickets were X amount.\n\nSo he proceeded on the basis of what she told him, which is that she couldn't go, period.", "Well, a this point i whould go with eigther nta or esh. I mean, both lacked communication. He could have talked better about the trip he wanted to do prior, and she pretty much ignored his wich to travel he mentioned multiple times. I mean, she always blocked off with later, can't afford it now. Everyone who experienced that before knows it sucks. She could have said that she whould love to do this together and work out a savings plan to be able to do it in a year, or if not possible tell him to go ahead.", "I\u2019m actually going on a week long trip without my husband later this year. I asked him if he wanted to come, he said no. I asked if he knew of any plans which might conflict with that week, he said it should be fine. So I went ahead and booked and he told me to enjoy my trip with my friends. \n\nCommunication is an amazing thing.", "Exactly this!", "Ok, but again, \"I want to go on a trip, you should come with,\" \"no, I can't\" is the discussion.  He had that discussion.  She said no.", "He said he did talk to her and that she can\u2019t afford to come. So he has accepted your pretentious pretense and in fact done so, probably a lot less sassily. \n\nI\u2019m reality off she can\u2019t afford to come for 1 week she\u2019ll be fine and they can always go back once they have the money.", "I don't see where OP says they live together or have any shared responsibilities.", "Not sure why you would say that. Our relationship is exactly the opposite of that.", "flex about what? he described relevant details to the story", "He told her before he booked it. And if it was a week, and my boyfriend found a cheap flight and needed to book it asap and told me after why would I care? He saved money and is going on a trip he really wants to go on.", "Sure, but if he had started with open communication and she responded unreasonably, OP would be NTA. That\u2019s not what happened.", "Uhm no\u2026I don\u2019t accompany him. I stay home and make sure our children, animals and house stay alive. Point being he clears his trips with me even tho he knows I\u2019m going to be ok with it.", "Yeah I think it\u2019s a pretty gentle YTA because it\u2019s just a bit inconsiderate (considering that it\u2019s only a week) and I\u2019m not gonna sit here and act like he should entirely pay for her or anything, buuuuuuut at the same time, I am someone who\u2019s in a 2.5 year relationship myself and if my boyfriend did this I\u2019d be *pissed*, and he wouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s an AH move. He should definitely have spoken to her about it first. It\u2019s not like Glastonbury tickets or something, it doesn\u2019t get sold out in mere seconds.", "I went on two vacations last year without my husband or children. It was awesome. Mainly because we could t afford to all go and my. Brother graduated, and the other was my \u201cprize\u201d for making it through a really really hard basketball season where my husband was gone almost everyday.", "If my partner told me he wanted to go somewhere for a vacation and I said I couldn't go, then he booked the trip anyway, I'd be hurt. That is something that should require a discussion. 1) does she want to go? Did he even ask? If she doesn't want to go, then he should still actually tell her he's planning to go himself before he starts making actual plans. If she does want to go, then move on to 2) how much time does she need to be able to save to go? And 3) what's the budget so she can actually figure out how long she needs. You don't just up and leave your partner of 5 years without explanation, you talk to them and figure things out like a grown up.", "If my partner told me he wanted to go somewhere for a vacation and I said I couldn't go, then he booked the trip anyway, I'd be hurt.

You don't just up and leave your partner of 5 years without explanation, you talk to them and figure things out like a grown up.", "Agreed, but OP left out a few key points here that you and your husband actually *did* do - he didn\u2019t talk to his girlfriend about it properly before booking the tickets, it sounds like they discussed it way before when it was a hypothetical concept, but he basically just steamrolled her a bit when it came down to the reality. Apologies if that was the exact point you were making - I absolutely agree that communication is the issue here, not him going on the trip solo!", "Honestly, it really isn't complicated. Just communicate and respect each other's feelings and you will have an amazing relationship 99% of the time. My husband has also done solo weekend trips, and it's never been an issue. But yeah, he's always talked about it with me first, and my answer, has always been \"have fun.\"", "He talked to her before he found cheap tickets, not after.", ">When I got the chance to buy cheap roundtrip tickets, I informed her briefly but I went ahead and booked for myself. Of course, she was understandably upset. We talked about this, and the main reason she was upset was because it felt to her like I didnt include her in my decision, and that I was super impulsive.  \n\n\nNo he briefly told her and then just booked tickets for himself.  He really didn't take her into account at all. The girlfriend isn't saying she wont be okay for a week. She is saying it would have been nice to have been involved or at least consulted. You know generally what you do when you are in a long term relationship. You make decisions together.", "You were right when you said once THEY have money because at the moment it doesn't seem like they've combined finances. After 5 years of dating though, I couldn't imagine going anywhere without my spouse because she couldn't afford it. If we still couldn't afford it after dividing up the costs based on income, we'd come up with a plan to go together some time in the future.", "L", "notice the words \"most likely\"? yeah. they've been together for 5 years, it's reasonable to assume they share at least some responsibility together.", "OP mentioned they talked about it and the potential for her to come. He expressed he wanted her to come with but she can't afford it. He should still be able to live out his dream vacation. If he would have booked the vacation without any discussion of her ability/desire to go I would be with you.", "He did ask.  Read the submission.\n\n> I had this intense urge to travel to Japan this year and I was actually telling her to come with me a few times, but she told me that she couldn\u2019t afford to travel to Japan yet.\n\nHe listened to what she was telling him, believed her, and stopped pressuring her to do something she couldn't afford.  Wow, what an asshole.", "No, it sounds like OP has been dreaming of this trip forever and they\u2019ve probably had this conversation a plethora of times. And at a certain point OP finally decides to make his dream a reality after talking about it for so long. Yah talk to your GF about it, but at a certain point everyone has personal agency and has to do what they want. OP is NTA and you can tell because the sympathy felt for upsetting his GF. \n\nA text saying \u201cI found cheap tickets for my dream trip and I\u2019m booking it\u201d is plenty to get a conversation going and then GF can contest if she wants then. If not contested and he bought the tickets then she throws a fit because \u201cshe wasn\u2019t consulted\u201d than she\u2019s just being childish. \n\nLiving together or not, it\u2019s about OPs dreams and his GF should fully support them. Imagine dating someone for 5 years and telling them \u201ctake me with you or else don\u2019t live your dream\u2019. I\u2019d never tell my girlfriend if 9 years anything of the sort let alone a spouse or anything like that. Childish.", "No, he said he wanted to go that year, she said she couldn't afford to go THAT YEAR. He could have figured something out with her for another year, or at least bothered to ask if she was okay with him going on his own or if she wanted him to wait until she could afford it.", "She never said she didn't want to go, she said she couldn't afford to go this year. To me, that implies that they should create a savings plan and go another year, not that he should just up and leave without another word.", "No it sounds like he found cheap tickets. Briefly let her know then booked a round trip for himself without even waiting to have a discussion with her.  That's childish. \n\nHe could have actually talked to her about it. He even says the girlfriend is upset because he didn't discuss it with her. That's the whole problem. He did what he wanted without consulting the person her has been in a relationship for 5 years. \n\nIts bloody selfish to not even consult with your partner and just do what you want.  Imagine dating someone for 5 years and not even thinking about their feelings when you selfishly book a trip without actually talking to them.", "He said \u201cI informed her briefly\u201d meaning he told her about the cheap tickets. And I\u2019m sure OP is more aware of his finances than you are of his, he probably knew the resulting convo would lead to his dream vacation being out on hold out of guilt. \n\nI may be inferring too much there. \n\nEither way, the reality is he DID tell GF about the tickets according to his post so the whole \u201ctalk to your GF before doing things\u201d argument is invalid. \n\nOP, NTA", "Told her, not had a discussion with her. Then jumped and booked tickets for himself only,  after 5 years of being with someone.  Even if he knew the results of the convo you still have to have it. You don't just decide on your own  \nOP YTA", "you're both losers", "If they\u2019ve been dating for 5 years they\u2019ve had this discussion before and she should have been expecting this to be on OPs plate. If it truly is his dream to go to Japan she is standing in the way simply because she didn\u2019t get to tell him no. This situation could have been avoided if OP had a heart to heart and explained they would be going back in the future when affordable, maybe. But either way OP is not the asshole for booking his dream vacation after telling his partner he found tickets finally cheap enough for him to do it. Maybe it is a little selfish of him, but it\u2019s even more selfish for GF to hold him back from his dream trip. \n\nMe personally I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it without my GF, but OP may be different than me. \n\nOP is NTA and GF is NTA \n\nCommunication is key and so is a mutual understanding as well as maturity."]}
