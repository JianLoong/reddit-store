She also told me that it hurts not being able to have the capabaility of traveling with me. I told her that I understand, and I\u2019m sorry for being selfish, but I wanted to take this urge to travel solo even though she couldn\u2019t come.

You are your own person and can make that choice. You do not need her permission to use your money or your leave time to do something nice for yourself.\n\nAre you in some way neglecting your relationship to go on this trip? Are you choosing to do this instead of a more affordable trip that you both would go on, or are you using up your leave time so you won't be able to spend time off with her?

Japan is not that expensive if you travel wisely.\n\nWhen I had been together with my now husband for one year he paid for an 8 months long trip to 11 countries in South East Asia. He wanted me to join, I was a broke student doing my thesis and said yes, I want to come, but don\u2019t have the money. He just paid.

But had no interest. I also spoke about that Japan trip for ages. So he was not included. Oh yes, a few weeks before he started with \"If you really want to have me he will come with me\". But I did one of this \"If you want to have me\" vaccations with him and it was a nightmare. So I decided to let him stay at home and fullfill my dream instead to drag around somebody who has no interest in visiting Japan and want to have for each step a pad on his head, as he \"is just there for you\".  The vaccation without him was much more fun.", "NTA\n\nYou two are not married. Not everything you do has to be about the two of you.  Understandably she is hurt & you should definitely smooth things over.  \n\nBUT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nThis was something you were specifically planning for yourself, long before her. You always wanted to go. And while it does suck that you took the leap without her, you are also entitled to travel solo. Which I get that. Because you would also have to coordinate the details of the trip with what she wants as well. And sometimes that can cause friction in relationships.\n\nHave you ever traveled with her to other cities? You really should do that before planning an out of Country trip to see how you two handle the details of planning excursions, dining & accommodations.\n\nWhen I was saving & planning to move to California from my old Southern state, SO many acquaintances were hinting at coming with me. One girl blatantly stated that she just HAD to get out of there. And I pointed out that this was MY solo move & that I am not responsible for her desire to leave the State. I told her to save her money & plan like I did.\n\nSo, I feel the same is in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t have to delay something you have always wanted for someone else\u2019s sake. What if she NEVER got the money saved? Or ended up spending it on something else & then still expected you to wait until she saved again.  Or, lied about the amount & you end up footing the bill for both of you in a foreign country? \n\nNah, go have fun.

There's a reason.", "YTA for my communicating to her you want to travel solo. \n\nAt first the way your post reads, it gives the impression that you saw cheap tickets, capitalized on the deal and since she doesn't make as much didn't have time to discuss if this was something she wanted in on but you wanted to ensure you got yours. Kinda like finding Taylor Swift tickets but only one available and snapping at the opportunity.\n\nBut as you read the rest of the post, you are describing you just want to travel to Japan solo and there's other trips you'll be more than happy to take her on. So it really didn't matter if you got a deal or not, acted quickly or not, you wanted this trip solo and from the post it didn't seem that you told her that. OR you lied and created the impression you wanted to go to Japan with her and have since changed to want a solo trip, or used that as justification/an excuse for the solo trip. If you wanted a solo trip from the beginning, YTA for not communicating that too her. If you wanted to go to Japan with her and booked hastily and are willingly to have a great time solo, YTA for completely disregarding her and behaving like you were not in a relationship.", "YTA. I was with you until I saw you guys have been together 5 YEARS. Are you kidding me\u2026\u2026.is there no way you could have helped her out a bit financially so you both could go? Like wtf. Lots of people would even let their friend borrow money if they needed it but your GIRLFRIEND OF FIVE YEARS YOU couldn\u2019t offer up any money to help her out so she could come with you? Come on man. I don\u2019t think you ever wanted her to come to begin with. Just admit it.", "Wtf is wrong with you? YTA", "YTA.  But you\u2019ll only realize this when she does something like to you.", "YTA. Not for wanting to travel alone. The way you went about it was immature.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been with her for a couple of months and aren\u2019t serious, you\u2019ve been together for 5 years. It\u2019s kind of shitty to just leave her behind because of a whim.", "Can you go? Sure, should you expect to have a gf when you return? Not necessarily", "YTA this is the kind of story that ends in her realising youre not the right guy and moving on while youre away without letting you know. It doesnt sound like a partnership situation if you do stuff like this, so dont expect loyalty back...", "YTA. You\u2019re just wasting her time. A partner would have discussed this decision first. Either you\u2019re immature, don\u2019t care much about her, or both.\n\nAlso, one week in Japan is like nothing. It\u2019s almost a waste of time and money. At least 2 will be travel days, right? Are you even going to see more than one area? If this is really your dream, shouldn\u2019t you have planned better? You could have saved a trip fund, with your partner ideally.", "YTA. I would be appalled if my husband gave me such little heads up on such a big decision. Traveling solo is great, but so is effective and thorough communication in your adult relationships.", "NTA.\n\nThis was not an impulsive decision. You have told her numerous times before this was your dream. When cheap tickets come up, of course you should buy them. Deals like those don\u2019t come around often. Sure, it would have been nice if the cheap tickets had come at a time when your girlfriend could afford them too, but that is ultimately NOT your problem. You are under no obligation to pay for her trip.\n\nYour gf is projecting her upset at not being able to go on to you. That is unfair and manipulative.", "NTA !", "NTA   \nI totally understand how you feel.   \nGo on your trip and enjoy it. People CAN do stuff on their own. Its ok.   \nNot only that, but you're young, and you're not married. Enjoy YOUR time as much as you can. You don't even know if you're going to end up with this girl forever.   \nYou need to make memories. Have experiences. Live life. See the world. And you don't need anyone's permission to do it. Don't live life with regrets.", "soft YTA. \n\nI think when you\u2019re in a long term relationship with someone and have spoken about things you want to do together, it\u2019s kinda sucky to randomly go ahead without them. \n\nHowever, it seems like you wanted to do this forever and I encourage people to try do what they dream of! Nothing wrong with solo travel!\n\nIf I was your girlfriend, I think the way you handled this would be something I look back on after we\u2019d broken up. An amber flag.", "NTA. Sounds like you set expectation for some time. Go have fun. Life is already too short not to fulfill a dream. When she does the same down the line be happy for her and support her choice.", "Either soft YTA (for the way you handle the ticket deal) or NAH (for your desire and also how you handle things AFTERwards, but perhaps leaning to NAH.\n\nAs the others have mentioned, it's 100% fine for you to solo travel or to have as much desire to go to somewhere- which in this case Japan.\n\nBut although you can afford it and your girlfriend has told you that she's not capable for it just yet at the moment, I think it'd be nice to actually talk with her before making the final decision by yourself. Not asking for a permission per se, but just like to make sure if she really won't go with you- something simple like \"I find this ticket here with as much price, and I really want to go. Do you want to join me as well?\" Even if you know she can't, I think it's just a nice gesture to still consider her as well (in this scenario, since you don't really plan for a \"solo travel\" qnd don't seem to mind either if she joins you up).\n\nI read the NTA answers here too, some that giving you their (or relative's) experiences regarding the same case, how the partner doesn't seem to mind it and so on. And of course those are valid too, but I'd like to add that every person is different- what might be okay for them maybe not for your girlfriend. You know her better; you know why she's upset, and I still think that her feeling is valid in this scenario.\n\nShe's not wrong for feeling left out because you did not invite him when the actual plan is really made, but I don't think you're wrong either for wanting to go to Japan nevertheless- especially since after the incident you did try to accommodate your girlfriend as much.\n\nMy suggestion is not to cancel the plan, but talk with her and make sure that you understand and accept each other's intentions/feelings (ot maybe re-invite him once again in case she can arrange things to still join you. Leaving while she didn't agree with somethig from your trip will leave a bitterness in your mouth, but not leaving will also make your heart heavy since this is what you've been dreaming of; so sit together and talk about it.", "NTA. She can\u2019t go. It stinks. Really it does. But you might not get a chance again to do this. Go.", "NTA. She can\u2019t afford it, hadn\u2019t started saving up, you\u2019ve been mentioning to her that you want to go\u2026 don\u2019t feel bad", "1 wk is useless.", "NTA. Women come and go, but memories of this trip will last a lifetime. You two aren\u2019t married, and you\u2019ve brought it up a bunch of times in the past, and she did not commit to it.\n\nYou found the right deal and jumped on it. Thats not impulsive, you have a track record of thinking about this trip and took advantage when you could.  \n\nGo on your trip OP. You don\u2019t want to look back and be disappointed later. Its much harder when your older, potentially have a family, etc\u2026", "NTA. Enjoy your trip!", "NAH.  You did misstep by not having a grown-up discussion beforehand and letting your GF know you were planning a solo trip to Japan, etc.  It is ok for couples to travel apart, and cost and time off work is a concern for most people.  It's ok for your GF to be upset at not going with you too.  My SO and I have taken separate trips, go to functions separately sometimes, communication and respect etc. are key.", "NAH-you can travel solo and she can be a little hurt that you didn\u2019t include her in the plan. It doesn\u2019t make anyone the asshole. My husband and I both travel solo a lot due to responsibilities at home that make traveling together difficult. \n\nWe did travel to Japan together, and the flight was the least expensive part of the trip-just fyi. Hotels were the most expensive part-and eating out got expensive fast too. So if money is an issue for her affording flights, it would be a bigger issue when it comes to affording the actual trip overall.", "NTA", "I can tell people will give you hell, but my man! Japan! I'd go in a heartbeat!! I know what it's like to have a dream destination because I also wanna go to the Big J, so for me NTA, this is YOUR dream, it doesn't mean you don't love her or that you don't like her, but we shall not wait for others to fulfill our dreams! you can go to other places with her!!!  1000% NTA, go for it dammit!!!!!", "INFO: what do you mean by \u2018I informed her briefly?\u2019 This is such a bizarre way to phrase it I almost didn\u2019t even ask.", "NTA\n\nThere are a bunch of controlling folks in this thread. My partner and I have been together for 3 years now and lived together for 2 of those years. \n\nIn our relationship, she is the one who has more ability to travel and I go with her when I'm able. Early this year, she went on a solo trip where she was gone for a month  while I stayed home and it was no big deal. And next week, she is heading out for a week without me.\n\nI wish I could travel more, but my current financial situation doesn't allow it as often as I would like.

Not weeks and not months. Girlfriend can accept the fact that OP wants to live his life.", "I mean - couldn\u2019t she still book a ticket if she wanted to go? He\u2019s just going for a week. He should definitely tell her that he\u2019s going but this is not something that he needs to ask permission for.

It\u2019s normal to be disappointed but it\u2019s not on OP to manage those feelings", "Seriously. If you care about someone enough, you want them to have a little fun in their life too. When I was two years into a relationship with my bf he couldn't afford to go to Greece with me, so I covered what he couldn't. He helped me out when I needed some procedures done (cosmetic, but my insecurities regarding it were making me depressed) a year ago. If you are serious about a partnership, you shouldn't only think about yourself.", "This is what gets me, how serious the relationship is.

Also, they've been together 5 years, this isn't some fling. Would he really not be willing to cover some of the cost for her? \n\nYTA OP", "That's the part that got me too.

While it sounds like it could've been discussed differently, it also sounds like it was at least discussed and shouldn't be such a surprise - though that doesn't mean she'll feel great about it.\n\nMy BF went on a Solo trip to another country for a month, and while it was slightly different because I was capable of joining, it was important to him to.do it solo for personal growth reasons. We had open honest communication about the fact that I could be happy for him while also being sad for me that I wasn't going and tried to come up with ways to mitigate that. (E.g. getting to enjoy touching base with him while there and hearing the stories throughout...but also an agreement we'd do a trip together after he got back.)\n\nNTA OP - but please try and see if she's open to owning her feelings about it, respecting your choice, and finding a way to celebrate this with you even though she isn't going. It can even be a case of it making a.future trip for the both of you even better because you'll have some ideas of how it is there.\n\nBut 100% still go.
