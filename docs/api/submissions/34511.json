I am about three months out from my last chemo session, and about a month and half out from my last surgery Post chemo, I was, and still have a very hard time with my energy levels. Subsequently, i have gotten into sedentary hobbies IE video games, reading and writing, since i can do them even when my energy dips.\n\nMy younger sister (19F) and I got into a fight over what was honestly incredibly stupid, but she has always been quick to anger, and I was already in a poor mood, so my attitude didn\u2019t help. (i\u2019ll give details, but they don\u2019t feel relevant) She has also been one to snap very aggressively when angry, but she made a comment that I have deemed too far.\n\nShe called me a \u201clazy piece of shit\u201d because I didn\u2019t do much physical these days, and still haven\u2019t gotten a job post chemo. she shouted out me about how i needed to get off my ass and get a job, and stop being a lazy bum. She told me i don\u2019t do anything, just sit at home all day and be lazy. when i pointed out that all of this was because my body is still recovering from being racked from chemo, and she said that it was \u201cmonths ago\u201d (3 months) and that i needed to stop using it as an excuse to be lazy. I told her (well i was yelling - admittedly) that it wasn\u2019t that long ago, and that it takes a very long time to recover from chemo, and i probably never fully will. she didn\u2019t think this was a real answer, and just told me that i should be \u201cover it\u201d by now. \n\ni feel like this doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it is important to note that all throughout my treatment i have really struggled with my lack of ability to do anything. I have felt so useless and weak, and i have pushed myself farther than i should have, and got myself sick over it, too. I decided to listen to my body and rest when i need to, which seems like a lot to her, i guess. but i don\u2019t enjoy this. All of my hobbies pre-chemo were active, riding horses, running, hiking, archery, and i can barely do any of them. I constantly feel like a useless unproductive slug, and to have her say that has mentally fucked me up. \n\nI always blamed my sisters nasty comments on her age, or the fact that she\u2019s the youngest and got no parenting, but she\u2019s getting older now and this comment feels inexcusable. Even at 19 i never would have dreamt of saying that to someone in my position, and I honestly feel like I can\u2019t forgive her . At least, not unless she gives me a genuine apology, which she has no intention of doing, in fact she doubled down on her statement s.\n\nMy family thinks i\u2019m over-reacting, and that I shouldn\u2019t burn down our relationship over this, They think its just unnecessary discourse, but i can\u2019t get over it. she knew what it meant, and still doesn\u2019t care.

Surround yourself with people who encourage and motivate you. Not bullies and tyrants.", "NTA. I have ME, which chronically puts me in about the same place as you energy-wise, so I get it. It sucks so bad. Comments like your sister\u2019s are cruel and meant to hurt. She went out of her way to attack you at your most vulnerable, and it wasn\u2019t just an off-the-cuff reaction\u2014she went on at length to make sure you felt degraded. Someone who takes that much time to do that much harm doesn\u2019t deserve to be forgiven without a whole lot of work on their part.", "NTA I'm sorry about your diagnosis. Chemo is absolutely brutal. Different cancer, but I had severe anemia and required a transfusion after chemo. Even then after completing chemo and surgeries, it took a few years to get back to anything close to normal. And you're right, chemo has long term effects. Cancer fatigue is insidious. And it's very much real. It's also something that noncancer people don't understand well. They always think well its over, you should be fine now. There are lots of studies about cancer fatigue. Show these to your family. And work with your dr and consider connecting with a patient support group for ideas to lessen your fatigue. Your sister was out of line. She is also young. So I wouldn't fault you for putting some distance there between you now, I would encourage you to keep that door a little bit open for the future. Besides not understanding the medical issues you have, she may also be struggling with her own fear about your health and maybe some jealousy (attention). That's not your problem to fix, but  hopefully she'll mature and outgrow that. Best wishes to you in your recovery.", "NTA.  \n\nWith the recovery from cancer/chemo you effectively have a chronic illness right now. You\u2019re not being lazy - your body is working really hard to try to get better and recover.

The attitude is absolutely disgusting, and she absolutely does need to apologise for it. \n\nJust remember that she is the one burning down your relationship here - not you. Your family should be horrified that she\u2019s harassing her sister recovering from chemo, not defending her.", "NTA but i will impart on you what I have learned throughout life.  Forgiveness is not for her.  It's for you and your sense of peace.  You can forgive her and still be upset with her behavior and set boundaries for your relationship with her going forward.  Forgiveness doesn't mean she gets a free pass to treat you as she has.  Given all you have been through, it may be what you need to get past it and let the incident (not her behavior) go and move forward through your recovery.  Best of luck to you and I hope your treatment plan is completely successful.  I hope you hear these words... No Evidence of Disease.", "NTA. She does not understand exactly how devastating chemo is. It can take up to a year to feel anything remotely like your old self. She\u2019s being an ignorant teenager. She should try learning a bit about what her big sister has been through.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry you've been hurt. Her remark was uncalled for. I can only assume that she's a bit jealous that you aren't \"doing as much as her\". This is a HER problem. \n\nBe kind to yourself and your body.  Look up the 'spoon theory'.  It helped me understand my body better when I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that changed my life. You don't have to explain it to her, but you do need to explain it to yourself. You shouldn't be feeling guilt about what's happened and how you need to handle it going forward.", "NTA. You don't have to forgive her if she hasn't apologized or even shown remorse. I think people should be accountable for their actions and if she's going to say hurtful things like that, your not wanting to be around her is just a natural consequence of her actions. If your relationship means so much to her, then she should be the one to make amends. \n\nBut not forgiving someone doesn't mean that you have to stew over things or be bitter. Reassure yourself that you're doing the best you can and try to move on.", "NTA, info: do you know if she ever informed herself about your disease and the therapy? Does she actually know what a chemo actually is, how it works? That it destroys cell, not only bad but also healthy ones, that the chemo damaged your whole body? I mean informed or not, she was in the wrong. If she didn't know and actually thought you are just lazy by talking about something she doesn't have a clue and if she knew even more. \n\nIf a person who was as active as you stops to be active after an aggressive treatment a normal thinking person should be able to get that you aren't able to do so yet again. But while it's not an excuse for her behavior, consider that she maybe just don't want to see that you are still weak from cancer and chemo, because it is scary as f*** if your bigger sibling who used to be active and full of energy is suddenly weak and vulnerable. It shows your sister that you and also all other of her loved ones aren't save from diseases and even death. You could have died,  all of you can possibly get ill(again). That is scary for all of you. If you would be able to be active again it could be a sign for her that you are healthy again, that you are done with being ill. Is she in therapy? Of course you were the one who had cancer and suffered the most of all, but still she had suffer too.

Perhaps she is struggling to understand the real toll this has taken on you and is struggling to marry up the active strong ind\u00e9pendant you, with the recovering you. \n\nNone of this is an excuse to be rude and yell at you instead of talking to you, however 19 is still young and developing and sometimes regulating our reactions are still difficult when dealing with fear and anxiety. \n\nTBF she could also just be being a rude A, but I\u2019ve often found that masking vulnerability in asshole behaviour can be a go to for youngsters, especially when they feel thier feelings don\u2019t matter on the face of something/someone much bigger than them.", "NTA cancer survivor here and I can tell you it can (hopefully it won\u2019t but it can) take years to recover or get to your \u201cnew normal\u201d.

People will say to you \u201coh I thought you were over that\u201d like as soon as the needle comes out your arm on your last session you are magically healed. People can be incredibly ignorant and down right rude about it and you don\u2019t need that to come from family who should be doing nothing but supporting you.", "NTA. Three months after chemo? That's practically recent enough to be measured with a stopwatch. A lengthy recovery is normal. Also, I hope you beat the cancer and fully recover.", "NTA. I get that she's young, etc, and every other excuse people are throwing out, but the thing is what she said was absolutely asshole behavior, as is your parents defending her. How many times have her comments been swept under the rug?", "Muscles lost cannot grow magically in 3 months. The doctor can tell how much time would be needed for recovery based on the amount of physiotherapy done. OP's sister has no idea of what OP has been thru. Also in the precarious state that OP is feeling, it is unlikely that a doctor will give permission for her to work in a job.", "Armchair psychologizing here. I think sister's comments stem from something more than being pissed that OP can laze around while she has to continue doing her own stuff. I think it stems from a genuine fear of death, both OP's and inevitably her own. OP's illness is probably the first time she's seriously had to worry that someone she loves might die. Death is for old people. To be faced with mortality at 19 or 21 is very scary, and fear makes people angry.\n\nThe chemo was supposed to 'fix' OP and make everything go back to normal, like it never even happened. But OP isn't back to normal, and her new sedentary pursuits are proof of that. OP may never be back to 'normal', and that too is very scary for little sis, so she's trying to bully OP into being her old self again. If OP gets back to her active hobbies, then everyone can pretend that the scary bad stuff never happened.\n\nOP, you might want to have a serious conversation with your sister when both of you are in a better place. Ask her why it angers her that you're not pursuing your old active hobbies. Would she be this angry with you if you weren't back to running and horseback riding because you just had a baby? You might also suggest a few therapy sessions for your sister. This is her issue, but it's affecting you.", "I\u2019m a 28 year breast cancer survivor it takes a while.

You are right: at 19 she is too old to be getting away with making such a nasty comment. I had chemo many years ago and never recovered to my previous energy levels, so 3 months is nothing.

Anyone telling you that you need to move faster is just an insensitive person, ignore them. \n\nAs for your sister, she will never understand what you are going through as she is determined not to.

The disease & the meds I take make me sleepy. zofran turns me into a zombie \u2026\u2026. I\u2019m awake but I just sit there wanting to go to sleep. At best even with my new narcolepsy medication I\u2019m alert for only 8 hours. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThe good news if you are really nauseous from your meds you have a reason to eat lots of juice, ice cream, plain tortilla chips, wheat thins & original flavor Pringles go down pretty well. No idea why ice cream works but it does.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It works really well even on my I can barely keep juice & crackers down days.", "NTA\n\nHer not apologizing is not okay. Her commenting on your state when she knows what you went through, then continuing to stand by it is not your fault, she should apologize.", "IIRC the rule of thumb for chemo recovery is two months for every month of treatment.  So, a year and a half for OP.  \n\nOP, you are NTA, but your sister sure is.", "Her sister sounds ignorant & lacks empathy", "I watched my father deal with chemo during his unsuccessful battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.\n\nMy reaction to OP's sister's behavior would get me banned from this sub if typed out, and possibly violate several laws of man and God.", "Sister sounds *jealous* and lacks empathy.", "Agree completely. It's a very scary thing to face at any age, let alone during your teenage years. \n\nI suggest OP take her sister with her to her next appointment so she can ask questions and hear what the doctor recommends. Instead of holding on to the anger, maybe have discussion above and come up with a game plan to gauge what you can and can't do each week. Have her walk with you three houses down and back to see how you fare (with doctor's approval, of course). Getting her involved in your recovery can not only open her eyes to what you're going through, but can also make her feel as if she is part of the \"curing\" of your cancer.", "Yep. Sister is being one of those people who think being disabled is a treat where you just get to be lazy around the house all day, rather than recognizing that having the ability to make a choice about what to do with your life, including work, is it's own privilege.", "I think sister is upset that she isn't the center of attention."]}
