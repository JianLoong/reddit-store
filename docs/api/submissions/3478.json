{"id": 3478, "submission_id": "z7g5j0", "title": "AITA For Making My GF Leave Her Family\u2019s Party?", "selftext": "Before I start, I\u2019ll get out the way that I was a little shit when I was younger. I\u2019ve learned better now but sometimes my past haunts me. Also, as it\u2019s important, my dad would always refer to anything pink as \u201csissy.\u201d He did it so much that I associated sissy with pink. Not saying it was a euphemism for gay but it was something I picked up on and adopted.\n\nWhen I (26M) was in HS, I used to make jokes at the expense of others. I liked making people laugh and apparently making jokes about other people always worked.\n\nThis kid Greg (26M now, 17 at the time) wore a bright pink bookbag with flowers and had the name Marissa on it. I would always talk about him wearing a sissy backpack and it made others laugh. Eventually he started laughing so I thought he was okay with it.\n\nFast forward to now I\u2019m with my GF Kate (25M) and I love her to death. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and I want to get married to her. We went to her family\u2019s Friendsgiving party (Thanksgiving dinner the weekend before Thanksgiving with close family friends; it\u2019s catered) and I saw Greg there. I went up to him and asked if it was Greg from HS, the one that wore the sissy backpack. In hindsight, I should not have addressed him like that. He looked at me weird but gave me a look like he recognized me and turned to Kate and asked if I was her boyfriend. She confirmed it and he said he hopes she doesn\u2019t have children with me because they won\u2019t have hair. My hair is thinning and is a sore spot for me. She took him to the side to talk to him and came back to me and told me that I used to bully him about his dead sister\u2019s backpack and he never forgave me for it. I felt bad and attempted to talk to him but he would just walk out whatever room I was in.\n\nThe rest of the night was weird because I felt alienated and I was embarrassed. I told Kate we needed to go. She didn\u2019t want to but understood why.\n\nI know I was TA when I was younger but AITA now?\n\nI realized I didn\u2019t put this in here; Greg and Kate weren\u2019t friends in HS but became friends in college. They kept in touch ever since they graduated but weren\u2019t the friends that hung out all the time.\n\nEdit: I've read the comments and adding this edit. Greg transferred to our HS junior year so no one knew him nor did he really talk to anyone to know the story. I didn't even realize I was bullying him because he seemed to laugh at our \"jokes.\" The teasing occurred for about a week before we moved on but I realized it had an impact on him. You all are absolutely right and I'm TA. No one ever called me out for my lack of sensitivity so I'm always finding myself saying reckless shit. I don't mean to use the term sissy as a derogatory word but now I understand that my humor isn't the good/appropriate humor. I genuinely feel bad for what I said, I thought we were just chumming it up because he **seemed** cool about it in HS. Thank you all for your...direct words and I'll make it an effort to do better.", "created_utc": 1669687486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7g5j0/aita_for_making_my_gf_leave_her_familys_party/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hmm, yes, it\u2019s tough to see how you could possible be the asshole in this situation.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You used this re-introduction as another opportunity to bully him 8 years later. Think of how differently the convo may have gone if you had enough awareness or remorse to start off with a sincere apology (I\u2019m not even factoring in the deceased sister part of this, which is terrible). Not that he had to accept your apology, but it would have been the right thing to do.", "Yep... YTA.  You bullied someone grieving a dead sister.  Then you use your Daddy issue to justify the behavior.  Then you traumatized this again.  Just be glad you got off easy with a swipe at your thinning hair.", "YTA. He took one dig at you and you wanted to leave a party. After you made a dig about him. Think about how that felt for him when you did it multiple times in HS. I have zero sympathy for you. Not one iota.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYou were uncomfortable because you were confronted with the consequences of your cruel bullying.\n\nGreg clearly was hurt by your mocking, and frankly doesn't need to forgive or interact with you. You were an abuser. His reaction was rude, but also not unreasonable being confronted.\n\nYou were further rude demanding your GF leave the party. She was not at fault, you were", "YTA.   Yep, you are still an AH.   Your opening comment \"....sissy backpack....\" plus forcing your girlfriend to leave her own family's party are both well into AH territory.", "YTA and I think you know that. You should worry less about your thinning hair and more about what comes out of your mouth.", "Yta bc you just are", "YTA. I swear all bullies go bald. It\u2019s universal karma.", "YTA. You had to know better.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t learn better. Now you\u2019re a big shit.", "YTA still all these years later.", "You're a child stuck in an adult body. You're also a bully, to the core, and it has never gone away. People might change when they grow up, but it looks like you haven't. I feel bad for Greg, because that backpack was a memorial to his sister. Maybe, instead of being a little brat, you should have not mentioned the backpack at the party. \n\nYTA, and a bully. Grow up.", "YTA. You\u2019re comfortable bringing up his \u201csissy backpack\u201d but you got all butt hurt when he pointed out your sad little receding hairline. Get over yourself.", "YTA now for referencing the actual thing you bullied him over", "The whole story is how you bullied Greg in HS and you inappropriately asked him about his backpack when you saw him at the party, but the question tries to make the conflict about making your gf leave the party soon.  Nice try.  YTA.  If you can, contact Greg about making amends.  Realize that it won't be an over-night thing.", "YTA. Oh boo hoo you faced some consequences for being a bullying asshole to a kid who lost his sister, my heart fucking bleeds for you. God forbid you feel a little bit awkward at an event.\n\nSounds to me like Greg's not the fucking sissy here. Man up and apologise, if he (understandably) doesn't want to see you face to face then have Kate tell him you want to apologise, write him a letter or email or something. Assuming she still wants to be with someone who did that, anyway.", "YTA- \n\nYou weren't just an AH when you were a kid... You're literally still an AH calling people insults well into your adulthood. And then when it's pointed out what an AH you were and are, you're embarrassed and demand your partner leave her family's holiday party because you metaphorically soiled yourself in public... \n\nLet me reiterate. This is a current behavior you've described, not a past one. YTA. And every day you're either going to need to dedicate yourself to not being an AH or you're going to get dumped... Because she should dump you for this.\n\nAnd if someone i was dating walked up to someone at my holiday party they had tormented for years and said 'hey you're (insert insult)' they'd be dumped there and then and ubering home and out of my life.", "YTA.  Your past behavior is what made it a bad night for you.  You asked your GF to make a sacrifice to alleviate your discomfort.  But the one who should have paid a price for your past misconduct is you.  Suffering through the embarrassment and alienation for one night (feelings you no doubt caused Greg in the past) was frankly the very least you should have done.", "YTA. \n\nA bald asshole.", "YTA, and I hope you have a super lumpy, bumpy head when you go bald.", "Lol what? You\u2019ve clearly learned nothing considering rather than apologize for treating him poorly you  continued treating him poorly.", "YTA. No question. Who internally acknowledges that they 'used to' bully someone, and then when they see them nearly 10 years later continues to bully them.", "YTA still\n\nYou should feel uncomfortable. Greg didn't  have to accept your apology...not that you truly offered one. You KNEW better than to greet him that way. \n\nNone of this is about Kate. None of it is about him insulting your hair.\n\nYou are simply and AH and are trying to avoid the consequences of being an AH.\n\nWrite a letter to Greg with genuine remorse and understanding of what a disgusting thing you did making fun of and bullying a guy carrying his DEAD SISTER'S backpack.\n\nIf you can't do some soul searching and see how utterly horrible you were in HS, don't even try to apologize.", "YTA\n\nYou were a little shit when you were younger, you've owner up to that. The only thing that's changed is your size. And apparently also your hairline. Too bad it's not your cruelty receding instead.", "YTA, you reap what you sow. Your job now is to apologize PROFUSELY every chance you get, and even then if Greg continues to not want anything to do with you that is his right considering what you put him through. You mocked someone with no consideration for what they were going through. Glad you have seen the error of your ways, but that doesn\u2019t undo the harm you caused along the way.", "You\u2019re still a little shit, YTA.", "The fact that you couldn\u2019t man up and take your lumps and stay at the thing that was awkward because you made it awkward by being TA and instead made your gf leave because whittle ol you felt awienates\u2026 YTAx2", "YTA. For so many reasons. All of the reasons, really. Did you honestly need strangers to tell you that? Sort yourself out and grow up.", "YTA. Are you Greg I went to high-school with? Would have been better than Greg with the Sissy backpack. You are an adult now you should have filtered your words.\n(How big was your high school? In mine im sure Everyone would have known that Marissa was his sister.)", "How do you manage the brain gymnastics to make yourself think you're not an immature bully? Holy shit YTA , in so many ways.", "I don't think this post is about you making your girlfriend leaving the party.  There are advice subs where you could ask the real question.", "YTA because you haven't changed.  You intrigued about the situation by calling it a sissy back pack as an adult.  If you had been sincere you would have said \"Hey I uh think I recognize you.  Did you use to have a pink back pack with a girls name on it?\"  You resorted RIGHT back to your bully mentality at 26.  Turns out the kid was grieving none the less.  Why would he give two shits about listening to your apology as an adult baldie.", "YTA and a really bad one too she needs to leave your kid ass", "YTA. Do you want to change? Start apologizing, start wearing pink, get therapy, read about the struggles of other kinds of people. Get a friend who will smack you against the head when you say something grossly insulting. Don't say anything you think is funny. Write a deeply apologetic letter to Gary about how wrong you were both in high school and at the  party, express regrets only,  get your letter read by your therapist before you send it. Don't expect forgiveness. Part of your redemption will be accepting that your victims do not owe you forgiveness. Also,  apologize to your gf and hope she can tolerate you while you work on yourself.", "YTA for being oblivious. None of the stuff you even said was funny to be laughing about anyway, so you\u2019re also TA for having a shit sense of humor", "YTA...and your thinning hair is your karma for still being a huge AH. At 26? Ouch. Looks like Greg came out on top here. Well at least we know he has something up top", "\"Hey guys don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not a bully anymore!\" Then proceeds to bully the man", "That was a \"joke\" from 9 years ago, my guy. From the way you described events here, I assume you two weren't friends in high-school so, I don't know what would possess you to start a conversation that way. Also, it's not your girlfriend's fault you were an asshole teenager and, it came back to haunt you. You could've left by yourself if you were that uncomfortable. \n\nYTA.", "Hahahah!!  Yes YTA and Greg got you bad in the best way possible.  Leave him alone and try to be better", "YTA and I hope she sees it sooner than later", "Start by apologising to him", "YTMA\n\nAs someone who was severely bullied in highschool, I absolutely feel for greg. You probably triggered bad memories for him upon realizing who you were to him in high school.\n\nHim \"laughing\" at your joke wasn't him being \"okay\" with it. It was him trying to supress the humilation and embarassment he felt in that moment by pretending what you said was \"funny\", when internally, it absolutely wasn't.\n\nI hope you apologize to Greg personally, but before you do, make sure he's okay with having you contact him. Greg is well in his right to be angry and distant with you. \n\nAnd I hope to the power of the universe that you teach your future children to be all kind and all loving towards others.", "Some bullies never change. You don\u2019t need others to call you out. You are 26. You know what you did then was wrong. But that didn\u2019t stop you from doing that again in this thread. \n\nYou bullied someone this week because they used their dead sister\u2019s backpack! \n\nHonestly if you aren\u2019t already time for some self reflection. You are 26. Don\u2019t blame your cruelty to others on your upbringing. I was 11 when I realized that just because other people hurt me didn\u2019t give me the right to hurt anyone. You are 26 and you are still blaming the way you hurt people on others. It\u2019s passed time you learned to take responsibility and do what it takes to break whatever cycle you are in. I was 11. You are 26! Do better today than I did when I was 11!", "YTA. Here\u2019s a free tip: just because you didn\u2019t know the backstory behind something or someone doesn\u2019t make it ok for you to make fun of it/them.  Greg could have carried the backpack around because he simply liked the colour and you still would have been a major AH for bullying him. \n\nIt sounds from your edit you at least are willing to do some self-reflection which is a start. I suggest you check out your country/region\u2019s anti-bullying organization to educate yourself on the long term effects of behaviour like yours. Maybe get therapy to undo some of the harmful beliefs your father instilled in you as well.", "Oh no boo hoo your bullying came back after so many years to bite you in the ass lol.", "Lucky Greg didnt give you a two piece and a biscuit. Yta", "YTA in high school and you\u2019re still an AH. Instead of growing up and striking the word \u201csissy\u201d from your vocabulary, you continue to use it at the age of 26. Instead of trying to make amends with Greg, you try to run from the situation. I would not be surprised if your GF decides to dump you.", "You asked him is he was the Greg that wire the sushi backpack. Yea, YTA. Not just in the past, but now, actively. You need to leave him alone and just realize that you were and always will be a bad person.", "I think you are mistaking \u201chumor\u201d with being a fucking bully. YTA", "OP, I read your edit and frankly I don't believe you. you spent the whole first paragraph of the post talking about how you \\*used\\* to be a bully and you learned homophobia from your dad but now you know better. you claim you've gotten better, but the first thing out of your mouth was to refer to his \"sissy backpack\"? you only made the joke for a week in high school, but somehow it was so deeply ingrained in you that the first thing you remembered about him was the \"sissy backpack\"? we all see through you. you were a bully then, and you are a bully now; only now you don't have the social capital to pull it off. your first move at this party was to try and insult Greg, but when he gave it back to you you felt \"alienated and embarrassed\". \n\nalso, I don't buy that you've made it 26 years without realizing that the word sissy has been weaponized against gay men and women. you know full well that is a derogatory term, it's not your \"inappropriate sense of humor\", it is homophobic and you absolutely know it.

You dont go remind someone about bullying them like it wasnt a big deal. You dont tell your gf it's time to go when she doesnt want to leave. It doesnt sound like you have learned from the past.

No, bullies just want a target, any target, and a perceived weakness. \n\nGreg doesn't have to explain himself or justify his existence or choices to get himself exempt from bullying.

If it hadn\u2019t been Greg he bullied, it would have been someone else.", "When I said \"society\" I wasn't talking about Greg, I was talking about people like you who expect the bullied person to take control of the situation when they are just trying to fly under the radar for their own safety. \n\nBullying can escalate when the victim fights back. It takes other people to set the perpetrator straight.", "You are still blaming the victim of the bullying not only for their own bullying but that of other people? Just stop. It\u2019s not Greg\u2019s job to fix the OP.", "I tried telling my bully to fuck off and leave me alone. Know what it did? Nothing, except I got in trouble alongside her for using the F word. \n\nSchool administrators are notorious for siding with the bully and enabling this behaviour to continue.", "Bullshit especially in this particular situation.  OP would be expelled from the school if it continued after he was confronted.", "People like Greg are why people like OP make it to adulthood the way they are.  I was like OP.  I got my ass kicked, I ended up growing up faster than he evidently has .", "So go to other people.", "Granted, my experience isn't the end all be all, but if kids in my school were as capable of being that cruel, it's not hard to think that it could happen elsewhere.", "It is in no way that simple. Not even close.", "NOW it makes sense why you hate people like Greg.", "Greg is not the reason that OP is and continues to be an asshole. It\u2019s not Greg\u2019s responsibility to make sure OP grows up to be an upstanding citizen. We all carve our own paths, and OP chose to take massive shits all over his and then act surprised by the smell.", "So you were a bully, and you are still blaming the victim for \"making you do it.\"", "Soft people make hard times", "You\u2019re right. And luckily that\u2019s where OP ended up.  Lots of other times OP like people end up in positions of power and authority.  Imagine the level of shit OP would\u2019ve felt if Greg had spoken up. Especially in front of everyone.  Based on how he felt when he finally did find out,  it could\u2019ve had a profound effect on him.  The bottom line is that ignoring bullying perpetuates it, and it sucks for whoever the victim is, but you can\u2019t ignore it.  So yeah, I do hate people like Greg because while they don\u2019t have a responsibility they do have an opportunity to possibly prevent someone else\u2019s future suffering", "I find it really odd that you're blaming people who are bullied for why bullies turn out to be AHs.  It's an attempt to absolve people like you from responsibility.", "So you\u2019re projecting on Greg.\n\nBullies purposely choose to go after people who won\u2019t be able to stand up to them. It would take the sport out of it if they actually played fair. And what about all of the adults in OP\u2019s life? His family and his teachers? Why are they less responsible than a self-conscious teenager? You\u2019ve been watching too many teen comedies if you think it\u2019s so easy to stop bullying.", "Because change is only a result of consequence. It doesn\u2019t just happen.", "They aren\u2019t. OP acknowledged he got his asshole behavior from his schmuck father.  They aren\u2019t off the hook at all, they suck.  As for the teachers it\u2019s unlikely they knew.  I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not that far removed from high school to think that any teacher I ever had would\u2019ve ignored someone saying they are being bullied over their dead sisters backpack.", "I\u2019m sure Greg going to the teachers to tell on OP would have ended very well for him.\n\nI have several friends in various levels of the education system, and the amount of red tape involved in dealing with any situation involving students is staggering. And that doesn\u2019t even take into account the roadblocks OP\u2019s parents could have thrown in the way. Then you have the classic he said/he said. I highly doubt OP would have owned up to it. \n\nOn top of all of that, I have a really hard time believing Greg was the only victim. So what happens with the others if they don\u2019t have a dead sister?", "YTA. Eight years later and you did it again! You\u2019re still behaving like a creepy bully. \n\nThen you insisted (bullied) your girlfriend leave her family party because you felt alienated! Boohoo! \n\nKudos to Greg for getting some satisfaction. \n\nYou should seek professional help. A therapist can help you determine why you act the way you do. Why you feel the need to embarrass, belittle, bully\u2026others.", "YTA You were uncomfortable for part of an evening because of your past actions. You bullied others in hs, making their lives shitty for far longer. You literally asked him if he was the same Greg, followed by the derogatory word, from hs. Are you ok?? Get over your feelings because you deserved it and think about others for once.", "YTA for being a past and current bully and for making your girlfriend leave her family's party. Yeah you were embarrassed, guess what? It's called the consequences of your own actions for being an asshole and a bully. You're lucky that you're coming out of this with a girlfriend at all. \n\nGet used to having no hair and no girlfriend.", "Lmaoo I'm dying! Greg pointing out OP's very evident bald spot ONCE hurt OP sooo much that he wanted to leave \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm curious, since OP wants to /likes to make people laugh and people tend to laugh at others, how many times has he made his bald spot the butt of a joke?", "\"I've learned better now.\"\n\nNo, you haven't.\n\nAnd I can almost guarantee that Greg's comment about your hair stems from the effect that his bullies had on him; my bullies caused me to develop a vengeful, vindictive streak that didn't exist prior to my harassment at school. I developed a very cruel tongue that even today I am sometimes shocked at how quickly my thoughts about people,  usually bullies,  veers into hateful intent.", "Yta", "[removed]", "Years later and still YTA", "Karma's gonna track you(r hairline) down, step by step, from town to town. Honestly, the universe would rather go pink than go bald, you donkey.", "My god dude get some self awareness! WTAF? \n\nGreg laughed along with you so you wouldn\u2019t see that you were hurting him. You must be really blind and super immature to have not realized that by now. \n\nYTA times a million. Bullies suck.", "YTA, are you trash from HS the one with the balding head? Most people grow up, but you are still 12.", "YTA.   And it is time you unlearn the toxic mean behavior that your father showed you. You can't go around projecting that on everyone around you because you don't want to face your own pain.", "So you bully this kid in high school, bring it up as an insult as the first thing you say to him at this party, and then you have the gall to be offended and want to leave when he makes one dig at you? YTA - how are you anything but?", "Yeah you were and are but I can't help but point out that if he had just said it's my dead sister's bag and I carry it with me to remember her he would have taught you and your idiot friends a much needed lesson and shut that crap down immediately.", "lmaoooo YTA. you\u2019re a homophobic, misogynist and clearly have not learned anything from your bullying past. in fact, you still are a bully. try holding yourself accountable and take responsibility for your actions rather than blame people for not calling you out.", "I bullied kids in middle school, but one especially. I sent an apology via Facebook once. She didn\u2019t accept it and I didn\u2019t expect her to. The damage doesn\u2019t go away. Especially while you\u2019re still bullying. YTA. Do better.", "YTA, then *and* now.", "YTA. You recalled him by the insult, that doesn\u2019t indicate that you\u2019ve changed as much as you think you have", "YTA, you\u2019ve never grown up from high school apparently.", "Why would you think you weren\u2019t the asshole when you straight up returned to the bullying?\n\nYour edit is nonsense and you know it. He eventually laughed at your jokes to get you to stop. You know he wasn\u2019t ok with it.\n\nYTA", "Yta ask your gf for his email and send a goddamn apology to the man. Please have some review the apology before you send. You seem \u2026 tone deaf.", "Sounds like you made a lot of Greg\u2019s time in HS uncomfortable and embarrassing. Least you could have done was sit with your shame and embarrassment for one night so your gf could have a good time. \n\nYTA", "Hey OP, karma is a bitch isn't it? \nIn Chinese there is a saying: \"Good deeds yield good consequences, bad deeds yield bad consequences. If the consequences haven't arrived, it's simply because it is not the time yet.\"\nLooks like you got your time.\n\nI do commend you to at least feel embarrassed and shameful so all is not lost. If you didn't even feel those you would be considered beyond repairable.\n\nBut honestly now you do have to tread carefully with your gf. Greg has planted a seed in her recognizing how much of an AH you are. Now you could only try to show your gf via actions that you were just stupid and not an AH at the core. The first thing you do that shows you are an AH your gf would be reminded what you have done to Greg and dump you.\n\nAs for Greg, you owe him a sincere apology. He doesn't have to forgive or forget but you still owe him one.\n\nI guess you were posting here as a mean to be scolded since you are aware how much of an AH you are, so YTA", "YAH, but so is everyone else dragging you in the comments right now when you\u2019re putting in an effort to self reflect. People on this sub love to get on their high horse when the OP is clearly in the wrong like none of their shit doesn\u2019t stink. Trying to get your gf to leave was cowardice,  but it was also cowardice for Greg to not at least try and hear out your apology, especially when almost a decade has passed and you are just now finding out the backpack was his dead sisters. How tf did that shit not come up way back then?? Stay strong and move forward. Using your gf as a liaison to buffer an apology so he can at least know how awful you feel is a step in the right direction cause it sounds like Greg will be at a lot of friendly events in the future and it\u2019s better to squash this bug sooner.", "\u201cOh hey, you\u2019re Greg from high school right? I\u2019m sorry I was such an asshole to you about the bag you carried.\u201d\n\nBoom, not the current asshole.", "That explains sphinx cats", "NGL when Greg said OP\u2019s (prospective) kids would not have hair, I thought they\u2019d pull out all their hair from having a bully as their dad", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You\u2019re the ax in this scenario. \n\nYou give a long-winded explanation (read: excuse) as to why you used to be a bully. What you don\u2019t really explain is why you used what you now know to be derogatory language *again.* And to the same person you said it to to begin with. Or one of them, at least. I\u2019m assuming there were more. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much you can do to salvage things with Greg. What you need to worry about right now is your relationship with Kate.

Especially because you doubled down to Greg's face about the backpack as an adult. I'm glad you're wanting to grow as a person but I think you have a little ways to go yet.", "No, you hate that you were shown to be a bad guy.", "Greg\u2019s backstory doesn\u2019t matter.

Are you aware that it's from a work of fiction? Did you know that the \"soft\" it's referring to is the softness of decadent high society and not, say, trying not to get bullied by the knuckle dragging goon squad?
