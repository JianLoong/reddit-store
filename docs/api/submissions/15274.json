If you actually did use the ticket, that might complicate things though.", "\"It's your fault you decided to go on vacation and got robbed and drugged, so you owe us for a ticked we bought without your approval!\" Yeah definitely NTA because you said your peace and they refused to listen to you and now they're blaming you for your predicament.", "NTA - quite frankly, your family has victimized you a second time. The forced this ticket on you, told you not to worry about it, and are now emotionally blackmailing you to pay them back. Just awful of them.", "NTA but your parents are. If they really do not want money to ruin the relationship and they mean it that money is not an issue because they were worried, they should stop pestering you about that money. They are so contradicting themselves. It's them who are risking your relationship over money, not you.", "NTA.\n\nThey completely ignored you saying NO to this.\n\n\"Principle\" has nothing to do with this. You could have remained until your planned return. They ignored this, making you not responsible for the cost.", "NTA  \n\n\n  \nif you are buying something and want to be payed back always confirm that the person will pay you back before buying something espcially when they are inssting they do not need or want it", "Not the Asshole. \n\nThey bought the ticket without your permission. You told them you didn't want it. To top it all off, they said,\"don't worry about the ticket\" which any person would take as,\"you don't need to pay us back\".  \n\nYou already had a ticket to go home and they buy you this one making that ticket useless. If they keep bugging you about it, ask them to pay you back for the ticket that you bought and then never used because of them.", "NTA.  So their way of caring for you after you got robbed is robbing you off more money, that\u2019s ridiculous.  They can\u2019t do something for you under the pretense of caring for you, and hold it against you later.   You didn\u2019t ask for their help, they insisted on you to take it and went behind your back to buy it for you.  This should no way fall on you to pay them back.", "NTA entirely, your family making you pay for something you didn't want and they bought without your consent (even if you used it after to appease them) is really shitty move.", "NTA. Don't pay them back and try to find a way to move out as soon as you can.", "NTA. \n\nSo your family bought a ticket without your approval, didn\u2019t tell you of the cost, and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it\u201d, then they say you \u201cshouldn\u2019t ruin the relationship over money\u201d? \n\nI\u2019d remind them that you were content to wait out a week before your return flight. You did not ask them to buy the ticket, and when they offered, you said no. \n\nAs for it being your fault for travelling alone\u2026 how callous are your family exactly? This is abhorrent to me. It\u2019s victim-blaming. You were drugged and robbed. FFS your family should be ashamed of themselves. It could happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. It was **not** your fault that this happened. \n\nReiterate it as many times as possible to them that you did **not** want the ticket they bought. Counter every argument of theirs with it. And when they say \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t ruin the relationship over money\u201d, you need to say the exact same thing back to them. \n\nIf this happened to someone in my family, I wouldn\u2019t force the ticket on them. But if they wanted to come home early, I would book the ticket and **not** ask them for the money back. It would be more important to me that they were home safely.\n\nEdit: typo", "Oh Wow! NTA.\n\nYou repeatedly said you would be fine. You NEVER said you wanted them to purchase the ridiculously expensive ticket.\n\nThis would be my hill to die on. NO, No principal - no repaying of the money.", "NTA\n\nYou got robbed twice.", "Info - Are you of the age of majority? If so, do you live with your parents AND pay market rent such that you could live on your own as a real independent adult? If you don\u2019t, what continued decision making authority have you expressly or impliedly given to your parents for still depending on them to subsidize your room and board?", "I'd go with NTA, but... you used the ticket they bought! I know, parents can be too pushy sometimes and we would do anything to stop them nagging.\nYes, you told them not to worry several times, and they decided to go ahead and get it anyway. Since they said not to worry about it, you probably wanted to calm them down and agreed to use a \"free ticket\". And now they want you to pay them back, which is understandable from their point of view. What did you do with the plane ticket you already had for your return? Did you get a refund or you lost it?\nClarify the situation with them. And maybe offer to pay for a third of it?", "You told them no and they insisted and did it anyway. Sure, you could have still said no, refused the ticket and let them figure out if/how they can get a refund on their own. And now that you know that when dealing with your family, even in emergencies, that they expect repayment or restitution in some fashion based on their principals,  you should probably take that into consideration when/if you ask for help again. At the very least ask about expectations up front.  But you had had a traumatic experience and weren't thinking about all the details and neither were they, you both wanted you to just get home to safety. So for thinking it's unfair, NTA.\n\nHowever, just because it is a crappy thing to do to you, the truth is you did use the ticket and if they want to be repaid, you should do so. You were going to foot the bill for this experience one way or another, either by staying in hotels for another week alone and feeling unsafe or by getting on a plane asap and being back home to process and handle everything with support and safety.  What happened on your trip wasn't your fault but in life there is always a risk of being saddled with unintended or unjust consequences that you will have to deal with.", "> I 100% refused the ticket\n\nIf you used the ticket, then YTA.

At least we didn\u2019t drug you.\u201d", "There\u2019s other parts of the \u201cAsian\u201d thing you are referring to. Namely filial piety which includes express and implied continued obedience to your parents even in adulthood to an extent that may surprise many Westerners. But paying for college, extracurriculars and room/board for Asian kids even as adult inherently comes with strings attached. You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too by not recognizing there are reciprocal obligations for this \u201cAsian\u201d thing. I would say ESH since if you want to truly exert your autonomy in the classic Western individualist cultural way then you have to stop taking adult support from your parents. Leave the nest. Legions of NA and European boomers subscribe to the \u201c18 and out the door\u201d mentality but the flipside is no real implied cultural obligations to obey them as adults."]}
