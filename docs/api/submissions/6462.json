There are some that are to mark milestones and other fun stuff in my life. My mom died when I was 8 and my dad remarried when I was 11. My stepmother came into the marriage with three daughters of her own who were all younger than four at the time. I think they're all fine but I am not especially close to them.

My stepmother told her daughter's about it and for the last three years they have expressed wanting to get a charm added to represent them too.\n\nThe thing is I don't want to add people who are not all that special to me on it. I don't feel like adding four charms out of obligation is fair to anyone. Last month it came up a lot because I didn't go home to my dad's for Christmas this year, and my stepmother had told me she wanted to get me charms to represent her and her girls. I told her I still didn't want to add them. She snapped and told me I was hurting their feelings and they will notice the next time they see me that I still haven't added any of them. She also told me her feelings are hurt because she has considered me her daughter since she married my dad and I still don't regard them as close enough to get a charm. \n\nMy dad asked me what the deal was with adding them and I told him it wouldn't be done because I want to, and I have always liked keeping it for the most special people and things to me. He asked if I thought there would ever be a time where I would consider them special enough to me to add them and I said I didn't really see a day for that. He told me he understood and he would talk to his wife. But then days before Christmas she asked me if I had changed my mind and told me I am being unfair and terrible to her girls.

Entitled people are not charming and therefore should not be represented with a charm.", "Nta. They are being awfully weird and obsessed about YOUR bracelet.

You get to put whatever you want on it and I'll NEVER EVER EVER have an opinion about it bc that's how reasonable ppl behave\". Id redirect to them every time they brought it up. It had nothing to do with you, never has, so save your troubles for something else. I wear it not you so stop thinking about it. The more you push the more I feel alienated from you bc you are trying to control something that has nothing at all to do with you. So sorry they are being so weird.", "NTA. It's your bracelet. Aside from the stepmother forcing you, what would merit adding your stepsisters onto your bracelet? That is up to you.", "NTA and I also would not get another bracelet for them. Why? It would still be similar. She doesn't care about stepmom and stepsiblings that much. Just say no and if she ever gives you Charmes either don't take them or of she pressures you to take them just don't put them on the bracelet.", "NTA\n\nYour charm bracelet your choice no discussion to be had", "NTA. Why can't people just be left alone? It's your bracelet. You know who's special to you. She has major issues and she's trying to include her children to try to justify her need for validation.", "NTA.

She cannot force a relationship you don't feel yourself", "NTA\n\nYour bracelet you should be able to choose.\n\nI would tell her and her daughters once they die that you will add a charm for them - similar to what you did for your sister.", "NTA.   \n\n\nNTA particularly as the charm bracelet has accurred such significance over the the last decade and a half. I'm very sorry to hear of the passing of your mom and your sister.   \n\n\nI do have a couple of ideas for you, if you are fond of your step sisters. As the charm bracelet is so meaningful to you (rightfully), perhaps you could buy them each a charm bracelet (I know that these bracelets can be expensive, and you are pretty young yourself, but given the situation and meaning of the gift, your dad may be willing to help foot the bill). This way you can show your stepsisters that they are important to you and that you are fond of them. It will also grow in significance to them over the years, and help them understand why not every person or event gets a charm.   \n\n\nAlternatively, if you think your step-sisters would enjoy a bonding activity with you, perhaps your dad could take the three of you shopping for a charm bracelet for your stepmother. You could add something very simple, like the birthstone of the month she and your dad married, or if that idea is uncomfortable, her birthstone or a favorite flower. Something along those lines, just personal enough to show that you know facts about her, if nothing else.   \n\n\nIf, despite the recent nagging she's be decent to you over the years, I think one or both of the above would be a kind gesture. She's not wrong in thinking that it may seem like a slight to your step-sisters, and she certainly seems a little hurt here.   \n\n\nWhatever you decide, however, NTA.", "INFO: are they expecting you to buy these charms yourself?\n\nIf she's willing to buy the charms then maybe let her. Then you can slip them on when you go over?", "NTA.\n\nI'd word it this way. Your mother gave you the bracelet and it's a memory of what you have with her.\n\nConsider if you'd be open to a second charm bracelet for your new family and wear it when you go to your father's house. \n\nYou might also consider not wearing the bracelet around your father's house.", " NTA - its your bracelet and it has its own meaning to you, you said no and your step mom should move on. \n\nHowever, what you said to your dad is a little disconcerting. He clearly respects your decision but to say in essence, you will never be open to a close relationship with these people\u2026? That seems like an active choice to keep yourself permanently closed off from them.", "NTA but maybe try to compromise? Like having another bracelet for the step family or something? Like just say this is the bracelet you are currently wearing you want to remember the dead cause they truly always live on in  our hearts just like memories. Then hopefully they will understand and not complain about that one bracelet and it sappy enough that well you might have just made Christmas lol", "NTA. Unless you are adding other charms that are clearly less meaningful. Like an ice cream cone because you kinda like ice cream and it's cute. But even then it's a mildly jerk move. \n\n\nI would suggest another type of jewelry like matching necklaces or birthstone rings for your step family. Something that can be meaningful to you all that doesn't infringe on your mom's memory.\n\n\n This is a really sad story for everyone. As a step mom I know how hard it is to love someone who even subconsciously will always feel like you are trying to replace their mom. I'm sure she thinks that she is blending everyone together and making you all sisters. Showing her natural daughters that they are just as special to you as your blood sister and mother.  I'm sure your step sisters who are 12? And younger? All look up to you as what they want to be like ( Even if they don't show it). They probably see you as their sister since they were so young. But she's applying too much pressure and making you feel like they aren't special at all. \n\nI know that was a guilt trip but you should do something else with them to show them they are special to you. Because they want to be your family even if they are approaching this the wrong way. Do something together that won't contaminate your special bracelet with your mom and I think you will realize that they mean something to you in a different way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
