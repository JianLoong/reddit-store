But hearing aides are nothing to be ashamed of, they would show that you are taking proper care of yourself and responsibility for your issues. It's something I would personally really respect. You should also know that people of all ages have hearing aides. I've seen toddlers with hearing aides. I empathize that even the more subtle ones do risk being noticed, but if you don't look old then you could just be someone who got hearing loss from an accident or even from birth.   \n>  \n>What does make you look old is repeatedly telling people to repeat themselves and yelling about it. This draws a ton of attention to your hearing loss beacuse you are so loud. I think you may not realize how loud you are anymore due to hearing impairment but you could not be being any more obvious about it if you tried. Even people who weren't looking at you are going to know. Also, handling by repeatedly asking others to repeat themselves and yelling does make you seem like an old man. I've never seen a child or young person with hearing loss act like that, only old people. Your behavior is a pretty clear sign to everyone standing in earshot that you're experiencing a slow decline and either still in denial about it or don't have the money to take care of yourself properly.   \n>  \n>I'm very sorry to tell you this as I know it's harsh. But I think you should know that your current behavior is very noticeable and it's embarrassing. You would stand out a lot less and seem less like an old man in decline if you just wore hearing aides.   \n>  \n>But it's not just about how you are making yourself look or making our family look. It's also about how you are making everyone feel. First, I think you're making things worse for yourself. You care causing yourself needless daily struggles and frustrations. I don't want every day to be extra hard for you.   \n>  \n>You're also making your wife and children's lives worse every day too. You're making our day harder and causing us stress by being unwilling to take basic care of yourself and taking that out on us. Repeating things multiple times a day every day is annoying and wastes our time. But much more important then that, you're not the same Dad you used to be. You are less patient and you yell at us all the time when we aren't able to repeat things fast enough for you. I also can't even hold a normal conversation with my own father anymore. I just feel so disconnected from you, like I'm losing the good parts of our relationship and instead I'm just being yelled at. It makes me really sad.   \n>  \n>I miss the Dad who I could talk to. I miss the Dad who could listen to me when I needed him or just wanted to share something with him. I miss the Dad who was \\[so much fun/whatever you can say that's true/nice about his old temperament\\] and who I didn't worry would yell at me.   \n>  \n>Please Dad, I'm begging you to get hearing aides. Get them for yourself, get them for your family, and get them for our relationship. Get them so we can look up to you and respect you.   \n>  \n>Your loving Daughter, OP", "I'm petty, I would say that he already looks old because that's how being old works. \ud83d\ude02", "My experience is that hearing aids have gotten much better in the last few years.

They're good technology but they can't replicate natural hearing.
