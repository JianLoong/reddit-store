Your mom is an and enabler. Hearing aids have come a long way and many are so small you can\u2019t tell you\u2019re wearing them. Also do some research on the connection between hearing loss and increased risk of dementia. I had a family member with the same issue and when she finally went to the dr about it he explained the risks. That\u2019s what finally got her to get them and wear them.", "NTA. He could be fixing it but he refuses for stupid reasons. He could be gracious about not hearing you but he yells at you for stupid reasons. You owe him nothing.", "I don't think you're being an asshole for not repeating yourself to your dad. It sounds like you've been patient and understanding for quite a while, and it's time for him to get his hearing checked out. Maybe you could suggest that he get a hearing aid as a birthday present for himself, so he doesn't feel like he's getting old.", "NTA simply because he\u2019s the one who started treating you poorly about it to begin with. If he were nice about asking you to repeat yourself, it would be different, but he\u2019s not and you\u2019re fed up with it, which is entirely fair.", "NTA. I'm a 26 year old woman, and I have hearing aids. They're barely noticeable, and my hair is up most of the time due to work, so they're not hidden.", "NTA. If he wants to be part of conversations it\u2019s on Him to make sure he\u2019s able to participate. \n\nHe\u2019s actively choosing his vanity over your comfort and his own ability to hear you. So it can\u2019t have meant much to him to actually hear you sine vanity is more important.", "NTA - My husband (46m) desperately needed hearing aids and I was repeating myself constantly. I made a rule - I will say it once and repeat it twice, for a total of three times, but that\u2019s it. \n\nLife is vastly improved since he got the hearing aids!!!", "NTA. Your dad is being hard-headed. It's not your fault he doesn't want to get hearing aids.", "Have you thought of writing him a note saying you acknowledge how frustrating it must be to be losing his hearing. And how that frustration is making him turn into a bitter, grumpy old man, even when he isn't. Add that if it were you,you would miss the sound of your loved ones voices, and using a hearing aid would be a small price to pay. I hope things get better. NTA.", "NTA. But it sound like you could of handled it a little kinder. But nonetheless. He does need hearing aids. Maybe it\u2019s time for a heartfelt family meeting. On a side note. I don\u2019t know if your dad has been hearing aid shopping as of late. But, they\u2019re not what they used to be. They\u2019re very discreet, and not even noticeable these days. He might be thinking they\u2019re like how they used to be. Clunky and obvious. \u2014have a chat with him.", "Let me preface this with the fact that I'm a dad with a hearing issue and I struggle with hearing aid issues. \n\nI don't think you're being an asshole. I think you're dealing with a guy who is struggling to come to terms with a steadily worsening disability. He's being unfair to you and you're having a very natural reaction. I do not think you should feel bad about it. \n\nThat said, I know exactly what your dad is struggling with. My hearing is steadily worsening. My wife and daughter struggle with repeating themselves so often. My daughter sometimes gets very frustrated and will just go \"Nothing. Nevermind!\" when I don't hear her the first or second time. I see the look on her face and how frustrated she gets and it legitimately breaks my heart and makes me hate myself and what's happening to me.\n\nLosing your hearing affects everyone around you and it becomes really hard for everyone to deal with sometimes. \n\nAnyway, I think you're right to be angry that he won't even attempt to try the hearing aids. It really sucks not always being able to hear the own daughter's voice.", "As a hearing aid user, hearing aids don't always solve the problem.  What hearing he has will be amplified, what's gone is gone the way of the dinosaurs.  If anything hearing aids can come with there own issues, more prone to ear infections, learning maintained, if the moulds in the ears are slightly off, boy can they hurt, learning to clean them, getting used to the white noise can lead to feeling sick, very sick.\n\nHowever, because as I have mentioned above, you can do things so you don't have to repeat yourself a 1,345,271 times.  When talking look at the person, make sure you pick the best that they can hear, also looking at the person can help.\n\nJust for info, its not fun admitting that you need a disability, hearing aids don't \"fix it\".", "Heh. When my family was going through this, my dad would get REALLY mad. One time the whole gang was at their house, and he got mad when one of my brothers was basically doing what you're describing. He huffed off into the living room. The rest of us were sitting at the kitchen table and the conversation turned to some pickled herring my brother had brought. My dad yelled from the living room, \"my hearing's fine!\"", "Younger than your dad and I have hearing aids. A nice set at Costco is $1500, warrantied for 3 years. Essentially a dollar a day. His call. You\u2019d really need to be looking for them to see them", "NTA you don't have to rearrange your entire speaking patterns and wear out your voice shouting everything so an old guy can try to \"look cool.\" He's doing himself a disservice anyway--when the brain can't hear there is less engagement and nerve connections start dying off. He's killing his own brain.\n\nAnd yours too from frustration. =P", "No judgement. As someone who went thru this situation, you're fight a losing battle. Hearing aids aren't covered by insurance and good quality devices are quite expensive. You're not going to convince your father to get them. Your tactic will not work.

Either way, it's a waste of your time.", "INFO: Are you a minor?", "I think it\u2019s important to be patient with our loved ones and try to understand their needs.

My mother was like this about her cane. Refused to get a cane, refused to get a cane, refused to get a cane.

Man she glared at me so hard when I said that.)\n\nWith that said, has your father been to the doctor? I know this sounds stupid, but I do know multiple people who thought they were losing their hearing, but it turned out that their ears were clogged with wax.

Talking slowly, looking at them, and also standing just off to one side to speak to there best side all can help.  The thing is people think hearing can be down to age, and there is a stigma to hearing and age.\n\nOn a personal note I worked in a nightclub, and a engineering workshop, that's where mine was effected.\n\nOne way you could sell the hearing aids is does he wear glasses, well his earing aids are like his glasses but for his ears.", "NTA. If you were a minor, for safety reasons, you might have to repeat yourself when he asks where you're going!!

I wonder if he realizesd not getting hearing aids while it may look better is hurting his family relationships. :/", "Then write him a letter. Tell him everything you said here. Tell him how his shouting at you makes you feel. But also empathize. Hearing loss is a big deal. It's very hard to cope with it, especially since hearing is something that we regularly take for granted. His anger about it probably isn't about looking old as much as his own mortality is staring him in the face, and the hearing loss is the stark reminder of his body betraying him. That's heavy. So while you are frustrated, remember that he is loosing a lot more than you. Another issue is something that someone else pointed out, and that's the cost. Most hearing devices are very expensive and he may be concerned about that. In which case, you and your family should come up with a way to help him get them. AND make sure that he understands that he is worthy of the expense.", "Is he aware he is yelling or does he think he has raised his voice slightly but him not hearing makes him yell louder then he thinks\n\nYour not a real asshole though just wrong in this scenario I can see why this would be frustrating that he needs help and refuses to get it", "YEA ACTUALLY (I might tell him that next time)", "Not to mention if you are out in public and have to speak loud enough that it draws people's attention,  that would be more embarrassing than his vanity.", "That\u2019s probably it \ud83d\ude2d", "He is supposed to wear glasses but also hates wearing them because he hates how they look.", "He gets this grumpy look on his face and then goes \u201cI didn\u2019t fucking hear you\u201d so I\u2019m 99% sure he is yelling at me.", "Twice, at least, because he won't hear you the first time.", "I mean, you should."]}
