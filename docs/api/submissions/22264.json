This draws a ton of attention to your hearing loss beacuse you are so loud. I think you may not realize how loud you are anymore due to hearing impairment but you could not be being any more obvious about it if you tried. Even people who weren't looking at you are going to know. Also, handling by repeatedly asking others to repeat themselves and yelling does make you seem like an old man. I've never seen a child or young person with hearing loss act like that, only old people. Your behavior is a pretty clear sign to everyone standing in earshot that you're experiencing a slow decline and either still in denial about it or don't have the money to take care of yourself properly.   \n>  \n>I'm very sorry to tell you this as I know it's harsh. But I think you should know that your current behavior is very noticeable and it's embarrassing. You would stand out a lot less and seem less like an old man in decline if you just wore hearing aides.   \n>  \n>But it's not just about how you are making yourself look or making our family look. It's also about how you are making everyone feel. First, I think you're making things worse for yourself. You care causing yourself needless daily struggles and frustrations. I don't want every day to be extra hard for you.   \n>  \n>You're also making your wife and children's lives worse every day too. You're making our day harder and causing us stress by being unwilling to take basic care of yourself and taking that out on us. Repeating things multiple times a day every day is annoying and wastes our time. But much more important then that, you're not the same Dad you used to be. You are less patient and you yell at us all the time when we aren't able to repeat things fast enough for you. I also can't even hold a normal conversation with my own father anymore. I just feel so disconnected from you, like I'm losing the good parts of our relationship and instead I'm just being yelled at. It makes me really sad.   \n>  \n>I miss the Dad who I could talk to. I miss the Dad who could listen to me when I needed him or just wanted to share something with him. I miss the Dad who was \\[so much fun/whatever you can say that's true/nice about his old temperament\\] and who I didn't worry would yell at me.   \n>  \n>Please Dad, I'm begging you to get hearing aides. Get them for yourself, get them for your family, and get them for our relationship. Get them so we can look up to you and respect you.   \n>  \n>Your loving Daughter, OP", "I'm petty, I would say that he already looks old because that's how being old works. \ud83d\ude02", "My experience is that hearing aids have gotten much better in the last few years. I\u2019ve been hard of hearing since birth (age 35). Hearing aids when I was a kid just made sounds louder. The hearing aids I have now actually make sounds \u201ccrisper,\u201d for lack of a better word. And they absolutely make a difference for me. \n\nI also have completely-in-the-canal hearing aids, and most people don\u2019t even know I wear them unless I tell them. \n\nAs the industrious flightless bird above stated, hearing aids do not completely solve everything. But for me, they make a huge difference, and I would never not have hearing aids. \n\nPeople of all ages wear hearing aids. Hopefully your dad will be willing to try them eventually. His own quality of life would most likely improve.", "Looking at him is pretty important.\nI've lost the hearing on one side and have tinnitus.\n\nIf people are in front of me, I can see their mouth and have a much better idea of what they're saying.\n\nI have a friend that has issues looking at people's eyes and I struggle so much understanding her \ud83d\udc94", "You don\u2019t have any empathy for him though? People getting old and not accepting the consequences of getting old is a well documented thing that happens. People get therapy for it, it\u2019s not just a mean old man being stubborn because he hates his kid. \n\nThe best course of action is for the kid to repeat themselves, whilst pushing the father to get help for his hearing and for the issues he has, not to seek internet validation.", "First of all, can we please stop thinking of 60 as old? And no, I don't have much sympathy for someone who berates and yells at his own child over a condition he can at least improve. Dad needs to manage his own frustration with his limitations if he's not going to take advantage of anything that can help.", "Maybe yell it \ud83d\ude43", "Text it to him so he can read it.", "Yta. Do some research to help your dad. Aging is sucky, sad, hard to come to terms with and just plain fucked up. Having their butthole of a kid refuse to simply repeat themselves must hurt. There are small hearing aids that are hardly noticeable. Perhaps he only remembers the large ugly ones from back in his day. Try to understand and I find that speaking to people kindly helps disarm them especially when they feel understood", "I bet when you do say it loud enough for him to hear he gets defensive and insists you don't need to yell at him.... I swear everyone who's hard of hearing in my family does this and it drives me nuts.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I\u2019d probably be whispering things at him and smiling and nodding and walking off!", "\"I don't want to seem old!\"  \n\n\n\"...dude, you qualify for senior citizen discounts.\"  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA I'm 25 and I'm considering getting a hearing aid and idgaf about looking old. Stand your ground", "The dementia risk is real. \n\nAs is the loneliness and isolation - it's hard to maintain friendships when you can't hear your friends.", "He has a choice: look old or sound like T A", "My mom just got them and unless you were really looking for them you'd never notice", "This is an insanely elaborate way to handle the situation \ud83d\ude02 the note is one thing but the cards??   No offense meant, perhaps I was raised with a family less flowery with our affection", "It really is. My mom can only hear from one ear and even that is spotty. She's loud AF 24/7. Hearing aids won't work for her since she's missing the ear drum on the one side and only has a partial in the other ear. She's determined to get by with reading lips instead of learning ASL or looking into a cochlear implant. \n\nShe can't hear herself so she just yells all the time thinking she's talking normally. She also cranks the TV or radio to max volume. Like she'll park outside my house and I can hear every word of her radio program from inside my house. \n\nI also work with a local school for the deaf and hearing impaired as an art instructor. The kids are sweet and creative but I have to protect my own hearing because they get loud or play music so loud it makes your chest thump. Feels like being at a concert in front of the speaker system."]}
