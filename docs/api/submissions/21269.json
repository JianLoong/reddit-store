My grandfather passed when I was 11 or 12 and left all the grandchildren $1000 to get when they turned 18. I knew about it when he passed and forgot about it. Several months after I turned 18 I remembered and asked my mom how to get it. She said she took it out and used it to pay bills. \n\nWe were a working class family. My mom was a single mom who didn\u2019t have the easiest time (she\u2019s always made maybe 30kish) but did not have to pay rent because we lived in and she inherited my grandfathers SFH when he died. Or for our insurance as that was through our father. She also got good child support. So the only real costs were utilities and food etc. she was also a heavy smoker (although she quit) of both cigarettes and weed (still smoked daily) which is a big part of the grudge because for as much as we struggled her addictions didn\u2019t help. We couldn\u2019t afford nice things but we never had problems getting food on the table.\n\nShe is nearing retirement age and has literally no savings, only a pension. Her and the siblings have been reaching out to me to try and get me to help pay for repairs on the house, bills etc. the only thing I\u2019m paying right now is part of the phone bill because I\u2019m still on the plan. This has all started after I got a decent $80k job.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to help more than the bare minimum because my mother literally stole that money from me. I don\u2019t know how she got it out of the bank but she did. If she was going to get evicted or had medical bills or something I would help, but they are pressuring me to help with everything.\n\nIn my mothers defense, I was a NEET/failure to launch case. I didn\u2019t have a job nor was I in college and lived at home until 21. I\u2019m doing well for myself now but it took moving off to college to get here. She needed the money more than me. If I got it when I was 18 I likely would have spent it on video games. What bothered me was the fact that she took the money without permission or even telling me until I asked about it. Similar things on a smaller scale have happened either then or later, like lending a sister $100 and then her refusing to pay it back because I \u201ceat food that she buys.\u201d\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that sister (33f) is currently living at home and helps my mom out. She is not paying rent but helps with bills groceries etc. She makes about 40-50k and thinks that because I make the most of all of us I should help out more than I currently do (phone bill). Part of my worried for helping out more than I do is that the money would go to either my mom\u2019s addictions or sister\u2019s whims. Last time I visited she had a huge tv and some fancy new appliances. They want my help but they definitely do not need it. Sister also thinks that because she is helping by being at the house that she shouldn\u2019t have to help as much financially.", "created_utc": 1688429082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pzaf7/aita_for_holding_a_grudge_against_my_27m_mother/", "score": 768, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So he doesn't get to complain that his mother used his money to pay for a fraction of his food, when he would've spent it on useless stuff (by his own admission).", "Wow, thanks for your sage council, stranger on the internet. I will surely plan my life around your wise words.", "Where I live, 80k you're fine renting or buying a condo as long as you don't have a family.

You'll hear the same thing from them in 20 years or so, maybe it'll have more impact then.\n\nAnd now you have two opposite councils from strangers on internet. Whatever the contrary child will do now, I wonder...", "He said he was out of school and unemployed, and that he would have spent the $1000 on video games. It's not that far of a stretch to assume he was spending most of his time playing. I could be wrong about that, but it doesn't actually matter. He was legally an adult, he was capable of working, yet chose not to contribute to the household, and expected his mother to support him. She got child support while he was a child. Those payments would have stopped when he turned 18.\n\nHer addictions don't change the fact that she provided for him, even after he turned 18 and refused to get a job for the next 3 years.", "If my kid never moved out you bet I'd use inheritance from their grandparents for cigarettes and weed", "Oh no, his mom used some of her money to enjoy herself and relax and didn't put every last cent to raising her child. What a monster!", "to be fair I'm talking AUD but it's embarassing to say how much I make (sounds like a lot) and I can rent an apartment fine but I can't save at all and am close to paycheck to paycheck. It's the one thing that makes me want to settle and just date someone that I don't mind too much :(", "And she\u2019s lucky that he didn\u2019t have her arrested for theft and embezzlement \n\nyour point is pretty much moot and in some states child support payments go past 18 and judging someone for not being in college immediately when they hit 18 when not everyone is emotionally or mentally prepared for college at 18 says a lot about you", "He was literally a child my point stands \nAnd now also refers to you as well", "Yeah, she is and she didn\u2019t just use some of the money she stole all of it. She wasn\u2019t entitled to that money she embezzled it from her child, and you have the audacity to sit there and defend her and not only defender speak about it sarcastically and condescendingly\u2026.", "That must suck, the housing prices here have tripled or quadrupled in the past 20 years which isn't a good sign either", "Not everyone is mentally or intellectually suited to college at any age. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But if someone is not emotionally mature enough to get a job at 18, or 19, or 20, then they cannot be expected to be treated like an adult. You're infantilizing yound adults and that says a lot about you.", "What lol? OP said the 1000 was used for bills.\n\nYou were the one complaining that the mother had the audacity to use some of her own income on enjoying herself and relaxing by smoking lol", "They are still children at that age\n\nLike seriously the brain does not come close to finishing development until the age of 25. You\u2019re over simplifying a very complex matter, and seem to be speaking from a place of emotion, rather than fact\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re also entirely ignoring the crimes of the mother, which is the entire point of this reddit whether he should help her not after she stole from him, and committed a crime against him. Stick to the point don\u2019t get distracted.", "You need to read things thoroughly before commenting. The OP said that when the grandparents pass 1000 was left to each of the kids and that the mother use it all for bills or so she said.\n\nYou really need to read before commenting because you\u2019re missing everything that everyone is stating", "The fact that the brain is still under development doesn't make it impossible for a young adult to work. That's a fact you seem to be incapable of comprehending. \n\nWe don't know the legal setup of this inheritance, so we don't know whether the mother committed a crime by using this money to pay for OP's food and bills. If the money was left to her with the instruction that it should be given to her son, then she can argue that it did go to the son. In the form of free room and board that he got as an adult. \n\nSpeaking from a place of emotion, am I? Let me tell you a little about my place. One of my parents stole a lot more from me than OPs mother did. Including spending my grandparents' monetary gift to me when I was a child (way under 18). This parent did pay for part of my upkeep while I was in college (no tuition), which is what my grandparents had wanted the money to be used for anyway. The difference is that my grandparents' gift was worth more than anything my parent paid for me after I turned 18. And I was in school the whole time, way past the point when they stopped any financial support. OP's situation is different because he did nothing with his life for 3 years, lived for free off his mother, yet still thinks she owes him that crummy 1000$.", "You need to learn to speak clearly and not change your argument.\n\nThere are different points to this post. 1 point is that 1000 was taken to pay bills. Another point, that you were addressing, was that the mother is not broke because she bought weed and cigarettes.\n\nI was addressing the second part. You know replying to your arguement saying if you don't have much money you are still allowed to enjoy yourself and can buy weed without being a monster.\n\nNow you're changing the argument saying \"but she stole 1000\". That wasn't what you were talking about in your post I replied to.\n\nYou can still debate certain points of a post and not agree with it all, you know?", "OK I\u2019m not gonna have a discussion with you if you\u2019re gonna not re-things properly and then put words in my mouth that I never stated learn to read things properly and then maybe people will discuss things with you in the future", "Also, thank you for proving me correct with that overly long, emotional statement that has no bearing to the conversation and just proves that you truly are speaking from a place of emotion", "And my comment was based off of your lack of reading of the entire post. I didn\u2019t make any points. I was debating your non-points and your inability ability to read the post properly before commenting on it", "I am speaking clearly, and I never changed my argument\n\nI\u2019m not gonna repeat myself because you didn\u2019t care enough to read the first time and clearly not again the second time or third time", "Nta", "YTA. Rent costs for the time that you were 18-21 would've been way above 1000 bucks. If you're counting, and you are, you're the one that still has open debts to settle. Just because she never asked you to pay something you could not, doesn't mean you're not indebted to her. You got something you couldn't afford, yet desperately needed free of charge from her.", "NTA-we found out the hard way that when you help someone, they will expect it all the time. Paying bills should be the responsibility of the people living in the house, especially when they could afford it.

In all likelihood though, your siblings are already planning on persuading your mom that they should have the house your grandfather left your mum when she's gone and you won't need a share.    Money and greed divide so many families.", "Nta they are using you, they can budget and figure it out since your sister is living there", "NTA. You don't live with your mom so you don't have to pay for anything. Your sister is working and live with mom and obviously saved money. Unless your sister moved out and cannot support your mom and she is too disabled and unable to care for herself you don't have to do anything for the.", "ESH. Besides the 1000$ being taken , was she a bad parent? It sounds like you had a hard working parent who supported you from 18-21. Would she have continued to support you if you chose to continue that lifestyle. If you were in need of money would she drop money for you. Did she use that money to help support you and your siblings. Did she ever apologize? If she was honestly making 30k a year (idk how much child support is).

Did your other siblings get their inheritance?\n2. Other than bills/groceries, is your sister currently doing housework/caretaking that is in place of rent? Ex. Specifically things that she would not have to do if she were living alone?\n\nCurrently I think ESH\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter what you would\u2019ve done with the money, it wasn\u2019t your mom\u2019s choice to make without at least telling you first (asking would\u2019ve been better, but at least letting you know she needed it was necessary). Also, plenty of parents let kids live in their house after turning 18 without paying rent and given your sister\u2019s situation we know your mom is included in this; if that\u2019s on offer and there isn\u2019t an initial agreement to pay rent, it\u2019s not fair to hold it over your head forever or retroactively use it as justification for taking money.\n\nHowever, even if it wasn\u2019t her right to take it, not contributing to post-retirement care is definitely something that will hurt (potentially ruin, depending on what your family is like) your relationship with your mom and siblings, and it sounds like she likely spent that money on taking care of you in some capacity. So to hold a grudge over $1000 and potentially ruin your familial relationships seems very not-worth-it to me if I\u2019m understanding right. \n\nI do think it\u2019s different if 1. your other siblings all got their inheritance (it has no bearing on the retirement contribution choice but she should pay you back if your siblings got their fair shares) and 2. if your sister is mostly living there for free because she wants to/without caretaker responsibilities in any capacity (in that case, that is her home and she should be funding repairs as the person living there, IMO)", "Info: What is NEET?

A job, an internship, a gap year of travelling, studying, team sports... It really doesn't matter what you do as long as it's a) in the budget and b) you're actually gaining life experience and not just character levels in WoW. \n\nFor OP, it wasn't in the budget to do whatever and he didn't gain life experience. So, failure to launch. Which OP straight up told you, all you had to do was trust that they admit that because they've already done the self-reflecting and improved their life. Sugarcoating the truth OP already knows benefits no one, as anyone who has had to crawl out of that pit will confirm. It sucks and the people that actually help you get your life on track are the ones that don't sugarcoat anything and straight up tell you to do something with your life or drop dead so you don't burden others with your existence.", "I would need more info on that, I don\u2019t think most adult children want to move in and take care of their parents even if it is rent free.

She appropriated his savings to pay for his expenses and that still came out several thousands short. She'd have to \"steal\" a lot more just to recoup his expenses as a NEET.", "Regardless of your incorrect opinion, and for the, I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve said it now she still committed a crime, and it\u2019s not up to her how to allocate funds that do not belong to her"]}
