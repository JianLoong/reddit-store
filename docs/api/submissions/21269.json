My grandfather passed when I was 11 or 12 and left all the grandchildren $1000 to get when they turned 18. I knew about it when he passed and forgot about it. Several months after I turned 18 I remembered and asked my mom how to get it. She said she took it out and used it to pay bills. \n\nWe were a working class family. My mom was a single mom who didn\u2019t have the easiest time (she\u2019s always made maybe 30kish) but did not have to pay rent because we lived in and she inherited my grandfathers SFH when he died. Or for our insurance as that was through our father. She also got good child support. So the only real costs were utilities and food etc. she was also a heavy smoker (although she quit) of both cigarettes and weed (still smoked daily) which is a big part of the grudge because for as much as we struggled her addictions didn\u2019t help. We couldn\u2019t afford nice things but we never had problems getting food on the table.\n\nShe is nearing retirement age and has literally no savings, only a pension. Her and the siblings have been reaching out to me to try and get me to help pay for repairs on the house, bills etc. the only thing I\u2019m paying right now is part of the phone bill because I\u2019m still on the plan. This has all started after I got a decent $80k job.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to help more than the bare minimum because my mother literally stole that money from me. I don\u2019t know how she got it out of the bank but she did. If she was going to get evicted or had medical bills or something I would help, but they are pressuring me to help with everything.\n\nIn my mothers defense, I was a NEET/failure to launch case. I didn\u2019t have a job nor was I in college and lived at home until 21. I\u2019m doing well for myself now but it took moving off to college to get here. She needed the money more than me. If I got it when I was 18 I likely would have spent it on video games. What bothered me was the fact that she took the money without permission or even telling me until I asked about it. Similar things on a smaller scale have happened either then or later, like lending a sister $100 and then her refusing to pay it back because I \u201ceat food that she buys.\u201d\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that sister (33f) is currently living at home and helps my mom out. She is not paying rent but helps with bills groceries etc. She makes about 40-50k and thinks that because I make the most of all of us I should help out more than I currently do (phone bill). Part of my worried for helping out more than I do is that the money would go to either my mom\u2019s addictions or sister\u2019s whims. Last time I visited she had a huge tv and some fancy new appliances. They want my help but they definitely do not need it. Sister also thinks that because she is helping by being at the house that she shouldn\u2019t have to help as much financially.", "created_utc": 1688429082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pzaf7/aita_for_holding_a_grudge_against_my_27m_mother/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dear OP if you are making $80k take yourself off of the family plan and tell your siblings that your mother has stolen money from you as well as others, she never invested in her own future due to mismanagement of funds. Let them know that you will gift her a one time payment of $ (whatever you are comfortable with) and that is it. Tell them that you will not budge from this position and if they hound you on it you will contribute nothing. \n\nOP, your mother violated your trust and threw you under the bus because you \u201care her food.\u201d Yes, she provided for you but that was her job and responsibility as a mother!!!!!!!! Don\u2019t let anyone gaslight you into believing otherwise.\n\nLive your life and donate $1,000 in your grandfather\u2019s memory to a deserving high school senior or a niece/nephew who needs help.

The feelings following a violation of trust are not unique to Op.\n\nI've seen a will similar to your situation. Something like, \"To my son Joe, I bequeath the money he's already stolen from me. The amount I would have left him would have been substantially larger, but he made his own choice.\"", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to maintain your moms home.

No giving $200 for utilities, you get the logins and pay the bills directly.

And between 18-21, your mom spent way more than 1k to feed, clothe and house you.  At the time she used it, you were a 12-13 yr old kid and might not have seen the full financial picture.  So might be time to let that go and accept the money was used for you, even if it wasn\u2019t for a luxury item you wanted.", "So you live elsewhere and pay rent and your sister lives at home, makes 50k but isn't paying rent and pressuring you instead to pay money to your mother?\n\nNTA. tell her to pay rent and help fix the house.", "Uhhh. Living at home at 21 is not failure to launch lol", "INFO: if your mum COULD (and did) pay you back, would all be forgiven?\n\nIt's not failure to launch to not have a job before 21 lol.\n\nIt sounds like you're convinced your mum stole your money to fund her addictions instead of looking after you. Hard to know exactly where the money went. If I had to choose to hold onto inheritance money for my child and let them starve/go cold, or spend the money on food and bills, I don't think I could hold onto the money. A situation that overall sucks. But I know I would try to give the money back someway in the future.", "If she spent it on bills, she spent it on you.

Also, just because they have appliances doesn\u2019t mean they are rich.\nLike maybe they needed a new appliances? \nI mean people do buy things, maybe they got the tv used or financed it for small monthly payments.

Your $1000 was spent on the food and other items you used during that time.", "YTA, it's $1,000 man, nothing compared to the amount she has invested in you.

Based on my experience I think middle class and wealthy have very different expectations about the financial support/obligations between young adults and their parents. And even many of those who believe indefinite financial support to be a parental obligation would still insist their young adult child do insist they take some course of employment or training. \n\nWhat is unclear:  OP, how did mom express herself during and immediately following the years of support over 18? Was she completely ok with it, or did she at times (or frequently) plead with you to contribute? To me it\u2019s a big difference between suddenly springing a sense of indebtedness on you vs. if she was actually complaining the whole time but you weren\u2019t listening. \n\nI understand there was no communication about the stolen money but was there other communication about money and household expenses? \n\nI only hear that she should have been able to make ends meet.
