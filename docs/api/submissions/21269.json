My grandfather passed when I was 11 or 12 and left all the grandchildren $1000 to get when they turned 18. I knew about it when he passed and forgot about it. Several months after I turned 18 I remembered and asked my mom how to get it. She said she took it out and used it to pay bills. \n\nWe were a working class family. My mom was a single mom who didn\u2019t have the easiest time (she\u2019s always made maybe 30kish) but did not have to pay rent because we lived in and she inherited my grandfathers SFH when he died. Or for our insurance as that was through our father. She also got good child support. So the only real costs were utilities and food etc. she was also a heavy smoker (although she quit) of both cigarettes and weed (still smoked daily) which is a big part of the grudge because for as much as we struggled her addictions didn\u2019t help. We couldn\u2019t afford nice things but we never had problems getting food on the table.\n\nShe is nearing retirement age and has literally no savings, only a pension. Her and the siblings have been reaching out to me to try and get me to help pay for repairs on the house, bills etc. the only thing I\u2019m paying right now is part of the phone bill because I\u2019m still on the plan. This has all started after I got a decent $80k job.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to help more than the bare minimum because my mother literally stole that money from me. I don\u2019t know how she got it out of the bank but she did. If she was going to get evicted or had medical bills or something I would help, but they are pressuring me to help with everything.\n\nIn my mothers defense, I was a NEET/failure to launch case. I didn\u2019t have a job nor was I in college and lived at home until 21. I\u2019m doing well for myself now but it took moving off to college to get here. She needed the money more than me. If I got it when I was 18 I likely would have spent it on video games. What bothered me was the fact that she took the money without permission or even telling me until I asked about it. Similar things on a smaller scale have happened either then or later, like lending a sister $100 and then her refusing to pay it back because I \u201ceat food that she buys.\u201d\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that sister (33f) is currently living at home and helps my mom out. She is not paying rent but helps with bills groceries etc. She makes about 40-50k and thinks that because I make the most of all of us I should help out more than I currently do (phone bill). Part of my worried for helping out more than I do is that the money would go to either my mom\u2019s addictions or sister\u2019s whims. Last time I visited she had a huge tv and some fancy new appliances. They want my help but they definitely do not need it. Sister also thinks that because she is helping by being at the house that she shouldn\u2019t have to help as much financially.", "created_utc": 1688429082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pzaf7/aita_for_holding_a_grudge_against_my_27m_mother/", "score": 361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
