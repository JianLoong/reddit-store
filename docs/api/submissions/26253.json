Let your friends loan their car to her.  It's your policy and you are sticking to it.  Your friend is not entitled to your car and should not be offended at a \"no\".", "NTA. Insurance issues aside, what happens to your transportation if she is in an accident? How do you get around while she has it, and if she wrecks it? If she is in a tight spot to replace her car, how does she replace yours? She can rent one, take a bus or Uber, or one of those people saying you should loan it can loan her theirs. Or you and other friends could drive her some of the places she needs to go.", "NTA. There are all sorts of legitimate reasons why you shouldn\u2019t lend someone your car\u2026liability being high on the list.  But I\u2019m curious.  What would you be using for your own transportation needs while your friend had your car?  Were you just supposed to do without so she could have a car?  It doesn\u2019t matter if your circumstances don\u2019t require you to use your car every day (perhaps you WFH), you\u2019d still have errands and such to take care of.  You\u2019re not required to totally inconvenience your own life to make life more convenient for a friend.  \n\nAs for all the friends saying you should help her out in her time of need, ask them what days they\u2019ll be lending their own vehicles to do the same.", "NTA \n\nYou have made a sound decision based on objective observations. A person shouldn't lend anything without considering what they will do if they don't get it back. An item of clothing or a pair of shoes is easier to live without than a car. Money is another thing you shouldn't lend unless you're willing to take the hit if you aren't paid back.\n\nYou aren't willing to be in the position of not having a car in case something bad does happen. Your friend is certainly not in a position to replace your car if something happens to it while she has it. She can't even replace her own car. To be blunt, your friend shouldn't have asked for your car. It's not fair that she put you in this position where you had to say no. A real friend would not do that. They would wait for the offer of help and not jeopardize the friendship like this.\n\nIf the mutual friends think you're wrong, why aren't they volunteering their own cars or paying for a rental?", "NTA Being a good friend does not make someone entitled to your belongings.  As a rule of thumb, it\u2019s wise never to loan something to someone that you can\u2019t afford to go without.  I would consider your vehicle to fit this category.", "NTA. She can go rent a car", "NTA. Its your car. My friend wont let me even drive her car while shes in it", "NTA It's your car and you can do with it what you please (not to mention insurance issues with that). Also, why did she immediately ask to borrow your car and not just catch rides? My first thought would have been to ask friends if they'd be okay driving me places and in return I'd chip in for gas (or use Uber and/or Lyft if needed)", "NTA - she promised to cover any damages or expenses. People say that casually, underestimating that it can possibly run in to the thousands if not uninsured. If she\u2019s got that kind of money, why not just get another car? She definitely has options other than borrowing your car, and this reeks of entitlement.", "Nta. Why risk it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
