Which is okay with me going and paying my part, but that\u2019s why it seems more like a night out together.\n\nI see your point. But honestly, I don't think it's a bad plan for a late BP.\n\nYour friend has had a very quick and small wedding with only family. I don't think she'll mind of doing something pretty \"usual\" for her late bachelorette party.\n\nIf you think it's not bachelorette enough, you can still think of one thing to do that can fit the theme of the weekend, like watching wedding theme movies (4 weddings and a funeral, or something like that) while eating cake.\n\nOverall I'll say NAH. Your common friends wants to do something for your married friend, you don't want to. I think it's just people disagreeing with each other.\n\n>And yeah there definitely is saltiness in general about it from not being invited to the wedding and trying to plan it already a year before so you\u2019re not wrong haha!\n\nI can emphasize with that. But considering it was something done very quickly, with only close family, I don't think you should take it personally.\n\nTo quote one of my close friend when she told me I wasn't invited to her wedding: \"It is something very small with close family only. If we invite friends then we'll also have to invite more family and then it is not a small wedding anymore\"."]}
