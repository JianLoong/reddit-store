But honestly, I don't think it's a bad plan for a late BP.\n\nYour friend has had a very quick and small wedding with only family. I don't think she'll mind of doing something pretty \"usual\" for her late bachelorette party.\n\nIf you think it's not bachelorette enough, you can still think of one thing to do that can fit the theme of the weekend, like watching wedding theme movies (4 weddings and a funeral, or something like that) while eating cake.\n\nOverall I'll say NAH. Your common friends wants to do something for your married friend, you don't want to. I think it's just people disagreeing with each other.\n\n>And yeah there definitely is saltiness in general about it from not being invited to the wedding and trying to plan it already a year before so you\u2019re not wrong haha!\n\nI can emphasize with that. But considering it was something done very quickly, with only close family, I don't think you should take it personally.\n\nTo quote one of my close friend when she told me I wasn't invited to her wedding: \"It is something very small with close family only. If we invite friends then we'll also have to invite more family and then it is not a small wedding anymore\".", "NTA \n\nIf she wanted the bachelorette party experience she should have made time for it, or done it close and soon after.

If she wants the experience, she can foot the entire bill as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "NTA\u2026your friend is no longer a bachelorette.  She is married.  Hence, now a girls weekend.", "NTA.  And most people who go to the bachelorette trip are invited to the wedding (and know that they are).

That night was the only time I told them my true feelings. (Because how you live the house on a break and then come back engage?!?) and I let it be. They told me it was going to be a long engagement. They then move in together and started their adult life.

Turns out true definition eloped. (Woke up said why wait and did everything as quick as possible). Had 2 witnesses which was their siblings. I was hurt but then I realized it wasn\u2019t about me.

They did have re-do ceremony that I was invited to and I did attend. \n\n\nIf she is really your friend, sometime you have to realize that it\u2019s not about you but about the both of you finally celebrating her marriage.

I\u2019d remind her that I wasn\u2019t invited ti the original wedding, but would pretend to be curious when her \u201csecond marriage\u201d was occurring. \n\nYes, that\u2019s petty but deserved. She\u2019s not a bachelorette and even if she was, since you weren\u2019t invited to her wedding you have no obligation to give her a gift of any kind.", "NTA.\n\nThe whole \"second wedding\" thing that has cropped up particularly in the wake of Covid has gotten so ridiculous. This is no exception. She is not a bachelorette. She has not been for over a year. If she wanted to do this kind of event, and particularly if she wanted other people to pay for it (which they are already not obligated to - that's a lot of money to spend on someone else's life choice, and not everyone can!), she needed to do it when she was actually single. The way so many people are demanding two versions of everything (or do-overs) and expecting people to go along with it when it isn't even the \"real\" event the second time, just because the original wasn't big or satisfying enough, has really become narcissistic. \n\nNo, you're really not wrong about this. You're right, it is essentially a regular girl's night. That's fine, but call it what it is, and everyone can decide whether they want to participate and pitch in fairly if so, but there's no reason to center it around the \"wedding\" of someone who has already been married for a good while.", "NTA.

There's nothing wrong with meeting up for friends but she was offered the chance for a get together \"party\".

You weren't even invited to the wedding.  I think this was a weird suggestion, especially a year later.  You also already offered one back then, and she missed out rushing through everything.", "NTA. Seems like a money grab after the fact.", "Meh, split the cost evenly between everyone. Tell her friend that it\u2019s a sweet idea, and sweet of her to do the planning, but you feel like this makes more sense. NAH", "NTA and having it after the wedding doesn\u2019t even make sense.", "Precisely. The friend is no longer a bachelorette, you were never a bridesmaid, and you weren\u2019t even a wedding guest. Friend gets to pay for her own trip.   NTA", "Love this!!", "Go back and read it again the friend isn\u2019t asking it\u2019s a friend of her friend", "Yes! mainly it was so they could move in together and get more government aid for college by a certain time", "This!", "I misread I guess.  Had it as 4 people.", "I don\u2019t think you caught the part where its not her asking it\u2019s s friend of hers either", "She's not even the one asking to pay for this bachelorette, it's other friend asking.", "Calm down", "Really agree with this, think this sub needs to internalise the \"there doesnt always need to be a bad guy\" tho", "NTA. Especially with only 2 people paying. I would even agree to that under normal circumstances, let alone if it is in no way connected to the wedding.\n\nRule of thumb: if you can't afford to travel for your bachelorette party, you have to do something smaller. It is jot in you to oay for half her holiday!", "NTA", "NTA that is so tacky. Having a tiny wedding or elopement means foregoing a lot of the traditions. She can have a honeymoon a year later. She can even throw a full reception a year later. But she can\u2019t pretend to be an engaged woman a year later. Her friend should chill out.", "NTA - she\u2019s not a bachelorette.", "NTA, and it's bizarre to think that a bachelorette party for a married woman makes any sense at all.\n          \nIf you didn't make the cut for the wedding, you're not really her best friend even if she was yours. Save your money and move on with your life.", "NTA", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t invited to the wedding (idc about the circumstances as to why you weren\u2019t invited) and it\u2019s no longer a bachelorette party.  It\u2019s a girls weekend.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not close enough to be invited to the wedding, you\u2019re not close enough to have to pay for her \u201cbachelorette\u201d weekend. Also since she\u2019s married, you are right - it\u2019s just a girls trip. Everyone should just pay for themselves.", "NTA. Absolutely NOT TA.", "She\u2019s already married *and wants party now*?", "Not in my book. Why call it this when she's been married for a year?  It is such nonsense. NTA", "There is no such thing as a \"late bachelorette party\"; this has been made up because someone - either the bride or the friend - wants a weekend away and they couldn't call it a party with only the two of them.  Don't give them any money, don't go.  Almost anything associated with a bachelorette party would be cause for marital strife and you don't want to be stuck in the middle of the drama.  NTA and don't cave.", "NTA, tell the mutual friend that you will catch up on the next wedding. They were going to break up, then moved forward suddenly for government aid? It's not going to last.", "Oh god I used to work with someone who had the constant attitude that nothing could just happen, it always had to be someone's fault. \n\nLike if we had a site visit that was called off because of the rain, he'd say something like \"Eric decided to do it today. But I heard Joanne say that yesterday would've been better. This is on Eric\" No one cares, Steve!", "NTA She blew her opportunity to have a pre wedding event. There is nothing wrong with friends getting together to do something, but expecting them to pay for her part at this point is pretty entitled.", "ESH\n\nHonestly it's cheeky to do it a year after the wedding. This is just simply a girls night out!\n\nBut you're upset and in a way punishing her because you wanted to be a part of the Wedding and she had just family. It's not like she left you out and invited other friends, she just had her family there.", "NTA", "Nta.  This is  free vaca grab..", "No bachelorette for a bachelorette party. Forget it. NTA.", "NTA. She isn't a bachelorette. If she hadn't rushed her wedding, she would have been able to have these things.", "NTA - but have you talked to your friend about it? Does she support this idea or is it just this other friend pushing it?", "NTA - the friend asking you to pay half because she is gifting the trip to the bride is TA. It would be a different story if the two (+ the friend who dipped) had decided together to gift her a vacation. But to plan a gift-cation and expect someone else to help pay is not ok.", "NTA you\u2019re absolutely correct it\u2019s a girls outing.", "op=NTA\n\nno one is obligated to pay for a bachelorette party let alone one that's NOT for a bachelorette.", "Why are you so salty about not being invited to the Wedding? She only had family. If my best friend decided to get married, but wanted to keep it super small and just do family, I would be fine with it, to me it's weird when people get upset over not being invited to a super small just family wedding, like they take it so personally.", ">Within a year of dating and I say fast because in May 2022 she was thinking of breaking up with him. Then got engaged a month later\n\nNAH. Wait for the divorce party!", "Based on the fact that she married a guy she was about to dump two months prior? I say just tell her you\u2019ll pay for the bachelorette party before her next wedding. \ud83e\udd2a", "NTA, especially in this economy", "I wouldn\u2019t pay a dime for it. She\u2019s been married a year for crying out loud!!! If the one friend feels so obligated then let her pay for it. I really don\u2019t understand these questions, there\u2019s a great word in the English language, NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!", "NTA\n\nAsk if she'll re invite you to the wedding!", "It's not a bachelorette party. She had a chance to have one and she said no. \n\nNTA", "Your \"Best\" friend didn't have you at her wedding.  Your best friend doesn't call you much.  Your best friend wants a free weekend paid by others.   God save us from wedding drama and fake friends.", "NTA for so many reasons. What a dumb ask", "Going slightly against the grain here: Nobody'sTA\n\nIf it's labeled a bachelorette party/weekend/whatever, the bride shouldn't pay anything (even post-wedding). \n\nHer not inviting you to the wedding is 100% grounds for you not wanting to participate in any bachelorette activities though. \n\nI think you gotta choose one or the other but you can't have it both ways.", "NTA - it's not a bachelorette party.. it's a vacation", "I used to work with someone who acted like everything was happening to her personally. Raining? Messed up just her day. Out of the muffin she wanted? The universe planned that, paying attention to the bran muffin supply and making sure it was one short because that's the *one flavor* she was craving.", "NTA.", "NTA she chose to turn down your offer at the appropriate time. I\u2019d be interested to know from which party the suggestion came from. Is it the other friend\u2019s suggestion or the married friend\u2019s suggestion?", "NTA...a \"late Bachelorette party\" isn't a thing. She's not a Bachelorette any more. The whole point of that old and tired tradition was to unwind the bride and groom before they commit their lives to each other. That's done. That's past. Her time to do it was within the month of engagement. She lost her chance. Split that shit amongst everyone who is going including her.", "Nta", "NTA      Im not American,  so i can say this.    What is it with this entitled bachorette thing?  So much money spent by others in ridiculous places at ridiculous costs.  She's not even  married anymore ffs.", "Can't be a bachelorette party when she is not a bachelorette.\n\nFor real, a whole year later and she thinks she is gonna get a party? nah, that is like celebrating your 30th birthday when your are turning 31.\n\nHave a girls night if you want, but yeah, that ship has sailed. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "That is so bizarre and no I wouldn\u2019t give a cent. 1. a bachorlette party is only for those in the bridal party and since your best friend of 15 years didn\u2019t even consider including you, in her special day you aren\u2019t obligated to go, let alone pay for this. And it\u2019s a year after the wedding? That in itself is so strange. This is a girls weekend not a bachorlette party."]}
