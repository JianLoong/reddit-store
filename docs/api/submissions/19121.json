The wedding was so fast that I wasn\u2019t even invited to it and it was a small thing for hers and his family only.

Which is okay with me going and paying my part, but that\u2019s why it seems more like a night out together.\n\nI see your point. But honestly, I don't think it's a bad plan for a late BP.\n\nYour friend has had a very quick and small wedding with only family. I don't think she'll mind of doing something pretty \"usual\" for her late bachelorette party.\n\nIf you think it's not bachelorette enough, you can still think of one thing to do that can fit the theme of the weekend, like watching wedding theme movies (4 weddings and a funeral, or something like that) while eating cake.\n\nOverall I'll say NAH. Your common friends wants to do something for your married friend, you don't want to. I think it's just people disagreeing with each other.\n\n>And yeah there definitely is saltiness in general about it from not being invited to the wedding and trying to plan it already a year before so you\u2019re not wrong haha!\n\nI can emphasize with that. But considering it was something done very quickly, with only close family, I don't think you should take it personally.\n\nTo quote one of my close friend when she told me I wasn't invited to her wedding: \"It is something very small with close family only. If we invite friends then we'll also have to invite more family and then it is not a small wedding anymore\".", "NTA \n\nIf she wanted the bachelorette party experience she should have made time for it, or done it close and soon after. Not sure why the rush, sounds to me like it was just impulsive. To not invite people and then expect a bachelorette party a YEAR later is a little rich to me. If she wants the experience, she can foot the entire bill as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "NTA\u2026your friend is no longer a bachelorette.  She is married.  Hence, now a girls weekend.", "NTA.  And most people who go to the bachelorette trip are invited to the wedding (and know that they are).  Here, she didn\u2019t want to share her wedding with you, so an post-wedding bachelor party where you have to pay for everything is crazy.\n\nI would honestly just say you won\u2019t be able to go and leave it there.  They can just do their own thing and manage it on their own.", "Even if it was a true bachelorette party, you can't just ask someone to pay like that. NTA", "NTA\n\nBachelorette parties are for *bachelorettes.*\n\nAs in, unmarried people. \n\nThat ship sailed a year ago. \n\nAlso, asking someone you didn\u2019t even invite to the wedding to pay for your bachelorette party? Rude.", "NAH it's not the bride demanding anything or even her idea, the other friend who's planning this had the thought to make it a nice gift. You said no, perfectly reasonably. Nobody is an AH in this situation.", "Lol\u2026 NTA.. the Bachelorette ship has sailed", "NTA: tell her if she invites you to the wedding you will pay half the weekend cost.", "NTA. It\u2019s a year later and you weren\u2019t even invited to the wedding", "NTA, in all of the bachelor parties I have been to, the one getting married still payed for themselves. I\u2019m sure in some friend groups, they might pay for the bride/groom. But in no way is that the norm. On top of that, you\u2019re correct, it is just a random girls trip. She isn\u2019t a bachelorette and didn\u2019t invite you to the celebration of her getting married. She missed her opportunities for you guys to celebrate her.", "There is no such thing as a \u2018late bachelorette\u2019.  It\u2019s a girls weekend. NTA", "NTA - The audacity of the request is mind blowing.", "NAH- I basically been in the same situation, my BsF/roommate has been talking about breaking up with their spouse for months, took a \u201cbreak\u201d some things happen, bsf came back engaged. That night was the only time I told them my true feelings. (Because how you live the house on a break and then come back engage?!?) and I let it be. They told me it was going to be a long engagement. They then move in together and started their adult life. We still talked hang out and such but was easier to have time for when we lived together\u2026 one time we went out for their friends birthday and I said something something your partner oh I mean fianc\u00e9 and they were like don\u2019t you mean husband/wife. Turns out true definition eloped. (Woke up said why wait and did everything as quick as possible). Had 2 witnesses which was their siblings. I was hurt but then I realized it wasn\u2019t about me. So we went to a concert the next weekend to celebrate. They did have re-do ceremony that I was invited to and I did attend. \n\n\nIf she is really your friend, sometime you have to realize that it\u2019s not about you but about the both of you finally celebrating her marriage. You don\u2019t have to pay for the brides half. But stop calling it a girls night. Put on the stupid cheap slash and go along with the toast to the bride and/or what ever else that you all will do. Offer to by a drink or 2. Or change the setting to someone appartement and spilt the cost of drinks and pizza!", "Nta she's not unmarried or a bachelorette anymore..... So she just wants a party that others will pay for. \n\nWhy would you when you didn't make the cut for the wedding.", "NTA- I got married 14 years ago and didn\u2019t have the time or money for a bachelorette weekend (I graduated from college the weekend before I got married) so maybe my friends should pay for me to go on a trip somewhere. Lol. People are fucking weird.", "NTA", "NTA this is silly. Go LC with these \u201cfriend\u201d", "NTA. This isn't a Bachelorette. It's a random girl's night. She got married so quickly there wasn't time\n\nHer friend is ridiculous to expect to split the married friend's share.", "Especially with no invite to the wedding. OP is right this is just a girls night out"]}
