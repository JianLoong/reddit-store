She knew what she was doing and could have opted to not get clothing if she doesn\u2019t like your style and have gotten you something else. Being raised to not show dislike for a present is really only applicable if someone really thought you would like the gift not because they intentionally got you something you wouldn\u2019t like", "NTA \n\nI think that when you give someone a gift you have to think what the other person would like, your mother gave to you something she would like to see on you, instead of something you would like, it was selfish, in the other hand, I understand her reaction, when you are raised in one way it's difficult to see the situations of life with other lense, maybe you should talk with your mother and explain your feelings.", "NTA , as a goth and black sheep of the family ive been there done that. You dont have to change who you are to suit anyone. Your mom offered to return them so she had no right to act indignant towards you for accepting her offer ! Had she not offered ,id say just do the usual obligation to thank and move on . Ive been gifted terrible sweatshirts from my mother in law for 20 years. You think people would get the point we...

Why don\u2019t you list charities to donate instead of asking for gifts!  YTA.", "I\u2019ve worn dark clothing since I could afford to buy my own (around age 14 when I got my first job.) I only wear bright-ish clothing to award ceremonies where I\u2019m being featured, and it\u2019s usually just a bright accessory with a dark base. Hope that helps!", "NTA. If you had said you only have been wearing black for a few years and that you used to wear bright clothes, that would at least have been your mom buying something FOR YOU. A past version, but still.  \n\nBut as it's been *half your life*, there was no reason for someone, especially your MOM, who would KNOW what you like and don't like, to buy you things you don't like.  That's not her giving you a gift. That is her saying, \" you shouldn't dress the way you like, but like this, the way **I** think you should like, because I happen to know better than you, and what you like doesn't matter\".", "NTA at all!!! I've been wearing black since I was in single digits, very vocal about what colors I like to wear, and was ignored for decades. About 15 yrs ago I stopped arguing. Now when gifted clothes everyone knows I won't wear (like the color pink. It actually makes me want to vomit if I wear that color, no offense if you like it.) I immediately hand them to someone in the room I know would love it and say \"Oops! Looks like someone mislabeled this one!\"", "NTA. \n\nGirl, take those clothes and sell them on Poshmark or Ebay.", "Nta. I\u2019ve had something similar happen to me. Every present was bad. I sucked it up and pretended for them all until I got to the Amazon gift card. Legit she gifted me the same mug as the year before and I hated it then and never unboxed it and yep got it again. Smiled through it. Amazon gc was the breaking point though bc I\u2019ve HATED Amazon for 15-20 years. My sibling was like \ud83d\ude31 when I got it. It\u2019s very well known how much I despise Amazon. I was like I appreciate the money, but I just can\u2019t accept this. My nephew was like I\u2019ll take it and I was like well I won\u2019t so\u2026 it made things uncomfortable. Sounds ridiculous to most that use Amazon regularly, but in the past 20 years the only things I\u2019ve bought on there were for my nephew bc his mother decided last minute to go to florida for Xmas the year after my brother died so I needed the gifts asap before they left. Only one came on time. Fuck Amazon. Fuck shitty gifts. Cash is always good. I remember when I was younger working for barnes & noble my mom convinced my uncle to not buy me a B&N gc. He bought me a wawa one and I was like so instead of buying me books he bought me cigarettes and gas? That\u2019s fun to tell him.", "My sister used to do this to me. Bright yellow shirts and pink sweaters, both colors I detest. I wouldn\u2019t say anything after opening them but damn if I\u2019d take them. I would just leave them with her and if she brought it up that I did I would claim ignorance just like she did when I used to bring up that she knows I don\u2019t like them. Took a few years but she finally stopped. \nLeave the gifts with your mom at her house with no comment. If she mentions it just say thank you but nothing else. \nSometimes petty deserves petty. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThose weren't gifts. Those were critiques in wrapping paper.\n\nJust going to note that the kind of people who use gift-giving occasions to passively-aggressively insult recipients are also the kind of people who demand that people be \"grateful\" for their \"gifts\" and must pretend to like the festive insults being given to them so as to not \"ruin the holiday\" and/or \"hurt people's feelings\". My liberal use of scare quotes may clue you in to the fact that I think these people are manipulative assholes and have no respect for their conveniently self-serving etiquette demands.", "NTA\n\nAs a Goth myself I find it ridiculous that people want us to change who we are just to suit them. \n\nIf you don't want to wear the colouful clothes then give them back to your mum as well. You should't feel forced to wear something you don't want to just because someone gifted it to you.\n\nIt's also her fault for giving you something you never even wanted in the first place", "She's mad at you for accepting when she offered to return gifts she bought knowing you wouldn't like them. What a strange reason. NTA! \n\nMy best guess is that she was hoping you'd finally change your style to what she wants in order to be polite to her. You've done nothing wrong for sure!", "NTA. I'm very picky about what clothes I wear, and I'm very straightforward with my family that I prefer not to receive clothing as gifts. It sounds like you need to adopt that particular policy in the future since you obviously have at least one person who is entirely willing to disregard any concept of personal fashion to dress you up to *their* liking rather than *yours*. Also, regarding your mother's reaction: she should understand that straying from the provided list is a risk that has every chance of backfiring. You made your wishes known and she ignored them. That's her fuck up, not yours.\n\nIf It makes you feel any better, I also got a shitty clothing gift this year. I asked for nothing from my in-laws given that we have a rather strained relationship on account of my mother-in-law's history of abuse towards my wife, so she gave me what she always does: clothing that is so significantly and obviously oversized (like 3 sizes too big) that I can only assume it to be a passive-aggressive comment about my weight. Given that she's verbally sniped about my wife's (her *daughter's*) weight many times before, this would be par for the course. She fucking *sucks*.\n\nClothing gifts are honestly just lame. Give me booze over clothes any day - even if I don't like it at first, I'll forget by the end of the bottle. \ud83e\udd23 Also, dressing in all black with chains is the shit. Goth never goes out of fashion \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udda4", "\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA and I would be leaving them all with her. That's the only way she (hopefully) won't do it again.", "NTA I had similar arguments with my mother about clothing... back when I was a teenager. She eventually gave up and now gets me things I like", "Remind your mother that in the future any attempt to change you without your expressed consent that you have three options \n\n-Return to sender/gifter\n-Donation \n-Trash/rag pile", "NTA.  Next time buy her all presents you would like but she wouldn't.", "NTA - if someone buys a gift with good intentions and genuinely thinks you\u2019d like it it\u2019s polite to pretend to be happy and just sell it on / return it to the store quietly after the festive season. If someone buys something out of spite balls to that be as rude as you want, if they want to use the holiday as an excuse to be unkind then they have to deal with the consequences", "Total NTA.\n\nMy mom used to do this shit often, minus the holidays. I\u2019ve been wearing black, t-shirts, jeans, hoodies, chains and sneakers since I was 15. I haven\u2019t deviated much, except to occasionally add a bright sweaters or whatever I have to wear for work. \n\nA few years ago, she gave me some white, sleeveless, peplum dress with a mesh top (I have nothing against mesh, just dresses), and I sold it to someone I met on tumblr. When she asked me if I still had it, I lied. Most of the stuff she or my grandmother gives me now usually ends up in a donation box if I can\u2019t sell it. \n\nYour mother is doing this because she doesn\u2019t approve and wants you to dress in her preferred method. She can kick rocks for that. Next time, keep it and sell it. It\u2019ll be a few extra bucks in your pocket. And if she ever finds out and gets pissed, maybe she\u2019ll learn to stop wasting money trying to change people."]}
