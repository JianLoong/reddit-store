I actually won't put what I think about Jill and I certainly won't put what I think of your parents for treating you like a servant who doesn't have any rights or deserve privacy in your own room", "Nta you didn't cause a miscarriage by leaving an abusive situation. 1) miscarriages that early on in pregnancy are relatively common (that's why it's recommended to not announce you're pregnant until after the first trimester) and 2) even if it was due to stress and not something wrong with the fetus (which is very common in early development and leads to most miscarriages) the added stress wasn't your fault. She's lashing out in an effort to make you feel guilty and come back to being her unpaid childcare and punching bag. I'm so happy you were able to get out of that living situation and I hope you have the space and support now that you need to heal from such awful treatment at the hands of your \"family\". You didn't deserve to be put through any of that and none of it is your fault. Also I want to point out how brave you were in reaching out to your brother to let him know what was going on, as someone who's been in abusive situations before I know how hard it can be to speak up about it and recognize that you deserve better, so being able to get yourself out of there at such a young age is huge", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault that she miscarried. It happens all the time. If Jill couldn\u2019t handle being pregnant again then she shouldn\u2019t have gotten pregnant a second time. There were other adults living in the home that could have helped her but didn\u2019t. So they caused her to miscarry too?", "NTA. Stay with Tom and don't look back. She didn't miscarry because of you. She just wants to get revenge on you because now she has to take care of her other child. Just block everyone taking her side, they are wrong and know it.", "NTA. You are not to blame for the miscarriage. You did not cause Jill or anyone else in your family this stress. They created this stress by choosing to regard you and treat you in this manner. This stress is of their own creation. You leaving is a natural and understandable consequence of their actions. \n\nI cannot imagine what you have had to endure throughout your life.

All of this sounds abusive. \nHowever, that being said, something tells me we are getting the light/abridged story of everything that happened between you and Jill & your parents, and it sounds like battles, hurt and retaliation, a lot of toxic stuff. I\u2019d encourage you to examine any patterns so the echoes of that don\u2019t bleed into future relationships.", "NTA. This is complete bullshit. In no way did you cause this.

Stress doesn't cause miscarriages. With the amount I went through in my last pregnancy, if stress caused miscarriages then I wouldn't be looking at my sweet boy now. People have multiple children all the damn time without miscarrying because nobody else was taking care of their older children. At least 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage sadly, its just a sad fact of life. You didn't cause anything. They were abusing you, they still are. They are gaslighting you hard!

Just awful.\n\nNone of this was normal so please be glad you are away and try learn the healthy way families work so you can escape this pattern.", "That is not medically accurate at all, they\u2019re just jerks looking for someone to blame and, given how they already treat you, it\u2019s not a surprise at all. \n\nFor instance removing your door over snacks? Seriously, wtf? \n\nCut \u2018em off, stick with your nice brother and live your best life without them.", "NTA. There is no way her miscarriage was a result of your leaving and if you had stayed she would have still miscarried. It's not your fault. It was going to happen.

Maybe he couldn't sooner, maybe he thought you weren't treated as badly as he'd been.

So you not being around for a month, affected her *that* much that she would miscarry? First of all, the only way you can miscarry due to stress, is *extreme* stress. Extreme meaning, the loss of a loved one, homelessness, etc. Not just because you have an argument with someone over spicy food that you've hid and they move out.\n\nYou didn't do this to her, she's just blaming you for it because she doesn't have you to wait on her hand and foot anymore like a butler.", "NTA at all and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Block all of them as much as possible.", "NTA!!!!!!!\n\nAm I correctly reading that she was only 2 months pregnant and the stress of taking care of *her own, first born* child made her miscarry?", "Don\u2019t let her grief be misplaced on you. I had \u201cIrish\u201d twins ( 11 months apart) and though it was sooooo stressful I was fine.", "You are NOT the reason she had a miscarriage!! Sadly, these happen to women. I am truly sorry for all you are going through. Stay away from them. Try to keep all the things people are saying out of your mind. It\u2019s simply not true.\nNTA", "I\u2019m sorry, she blames you for her miscarriage because you weren\u2019t there to raise her own child? And you are a child? Wtf. \n\nNot the asshole at all. You have zero obligation to take care of anyone. If she miscarried it\u2019s becAuse the fetus wasn\u2019t developing properly.  These people are toxic as fuck and feel free to go no with them. You are not responsible.", "NTA", "\nYou have the right to your opinion. But, after hearing from numerous people that it's my fault and  from my other brother that it's not my fault, I'm looking for clarification from people who have no ties to me or my family so I can get an unbiased opinion.", "So.. NTA. At all.", "Exactly. This gaslighting. There are literally a hundred reasons she could've miscarried, especially at this stage of pregnancy, and all of them are more likely to be the cause than the father's sibling moving out.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She had no reason to go in my room, which was on the opposite side of the house from her room and the bathroom. So I thought it would be fine. I don\u2019t think she was high risk as she just carried on with her life as normal", "Thank you for your opinion", "Tom said I could live with him as long as I want.  I appreciate your opinion.", "You could say that. \n\nOr you could say that considering how poorly people understand even the most basics of human reproduction, it\u2019s totally feasible for a 17 year old to believe that he was responsible for a woman\u2019s miscarriage.  \n\nSadly, also feasible that a 20 something year old woman thinks her miscarriage was caused by a bit of stress over spicy noddles and other snacks.", "I have to admit it's my first too spicy ramen, Store 24, miscarriage post. I wonder if the pregnant woman eating for two gobbling up all the food will resurface as well. And the tried and true, red wine and the wedding dress. Oldies but fakies", "Your opinion is welcome, but it doesn't really help me. Why do you feel this way about my post?", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  I guess you never know...but Lol I have to admit that reading this post, I was like yeah, not sure this is real. The spicy ramen was what also made me start doubting.", "I\u2019m planning on staying with Tom.  Thank  you for your opinion", "Thank you for your opinion. I do understand that grief is crazy.  Even though I don\u2019t like her I hope she really doesn\u2019t blame me.", "Thank you for your opinion.", "My aunt had 12 and no miscarriages.", "No it\u2019s not your fault. If that was the case no single mother would ever manage to have a 2nd or 3rd child. Miscarriages just happen. Trust me as someone who has gone through it.  \n\nThe doctor explained it as sometimes if it happens in the first trimester it is usually  just natures way of dealing with a pregnancy when the fetus isn\u2019t developing as it should. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault and there is nothing that could be done to prevent it.  \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up over it. It was absolutely not your fault.", "Acrylic paint is non-toxic - it was fine.", "OP you are NTA. I have a child and had a miscarriage when he was 6 months old, should I blame that on the stress of taking care of him? Of course not. It wasn't your fault at all. Miscarriage happens, usually because of biological reasons, not because a grown woman has to actually act like an adult and parent her own child. You did nothing wrong and shouldn't be worried about this in any way. I am glad that you are going to keep staying with your brother because the rest of your family is toxic. Another thing you should look into is possibly therapy for how your parents treated you. You may not think it bothered you that much, but sometimes it will come back later on.", "She would have miscarried anyway and you still would have been blamed. There was no escaping that , You were their scapegoat that escaped! Stay with Tom. They can find a new goat.", "The \"too spicy ramen\" and the door being removed because of hiding snacks was what really got me. OP flew too close to the sun on these.", "I mean I\u2019ve seen pregnant people eat way worse from cravings.  If you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ok. I wouldn\u2019t if it wasn\u2019t my life.", "Good for you!", "She probably does hon, because it's easier than blaming herself.\nAs it was easier to plan her family counting on forcing you to care for a family you didn't choose to have.\n\nDoes it take a village to raise a kid? Yes. But it's not a conscription, people help because they love you and the baby, and because you are grateful. They are entitled to say no for whatever reason.\nI didn't even wake up my husband for snacks at 2am! Wouldn't dream of bothering anyone else.\n\nNTA and not your fault! I'm glad you have Tom", "It does not matter. She is not being rational with her blame.", "She might blame you because she is a selfish person that needs some one to blame. But it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that she had a miscarriage. Not yours, not hers. \n\nNow it is her fault that she is an unpleasant person. And if she can\u2019t handle her own kid with out abusing her sister in law, she shouldn\u2019t be trying for a second. \n\nHopefully Tom and his gf can help you get over this awfulness", "Of course. Her miscarrying has nothing to do with you sweetheart. Keep your head up and don't let them make you feel guilty for nature taking it's course. Hope you find peace with this.", "Her miscarriage had nothing to do with you", "That\u2019s great for her.", "And the acrylic paints", "I mean you believe what you want. I\u2019ve had my door taken away for way less.  I like spicy food and I guess  she didn\u2019t think they were spicy. I really can\u2019t say what goes on in a pregnant person head.", "Agreed on all counts.", "\nI mean, I enjoy painting. I don't know what it's like to be pregnant, but I do know that everyone reacts differently to smells. I guess she didn't like the smell when she came in my room, and my paintings were more than likely drying, so it would smell like wet paint."]}
