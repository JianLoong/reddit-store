So I decided to make appointments for the weekends and the Mondays (because my mom is also free on Monday) at different bridal boutiques. until I discovered that a specific store had my dream dress. I tried to make an early reservation but sadly they were fully booked on the weekends in the month of February and they were closed on Monday. If I were to go in march I would have been a bit too late. \n\nSo I decide to make a reservation on a week day. My mom is a teacher, right from the start she thought I was overreacting to the whole wedding dress appointments. In her opinion I should wait till I \u201close some weight\u201d from now till July and then go dress shopping. \n\nI called and asked if she could make it on Wednesday maybe take a day off or leave a bit earlier than usual. She wasn\u2019t up to it and told me to go with my mother-in-law. \n\nThe moment I tried on the dress I video-called my mom. She stayed online with every other dress I tried on. Then I found the ONE! i was in love and I could instantly see myself wearing it on my wedding day. I ended up saying yes to the dress. My mom was not having it. She started crying saying \u2018weren\u2019t we planning on going to other boutiques to see other dresses\u2019 and \u2018how could I say yes to the dress without her there\u2019 \u2018how I should have made an appointment when she too was available\u2019. Not to mention how the dress is too expensive, even though I\u2019m the one paying for it . Mind you I tried to be considerate and make reservation that would work with her schedule but everything was full and every other day she wasn\u2019t available. besides to go in march is just a huge risk because the dress might not come in time.  \n\nso after explaining to the woman at the shop that whole situation, she agreed to schedule another day to reenact the yes moment but with mom being there. However mom got mad and said \u201cwhat\u2019s the point you already chose a dress it\u2019s not like my opinion matters.\u201d I have no idea what to do, this should have been my moment to be happy and excited but it turned bitter because of my mom. \n\nAlso her constant nagging about my weight and how I should lose 7 kg to look best. I would have made a scene if she was there in person, I held my tongue when she mentioned my weight during the call because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. She keeps holding that one comment I made about how I\u2019m going to look after myself, try eating better and exercising above my head the whole time I regret telling her about my plan at this point. And now she is hurt and doesn\u2019t want to talk. \n\nAnyway, Reddit, am I the asshole for following my heart and saying yes to the dress when my mom was not physically with me ?", "created_utc": 1675949258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xuqgx/aita_for_buying_a_wedding_dress_when_my_mom_was/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
