So I decided to make appointments for the weekends and the Mondays (because my mom is also free on Monday) at different bridal boutiques. until I discovered that a specific store had my dream dress. I tried to make an early reservation but sadly they were fully booked on the weekends in the month of February and they were closed on Monday. If I were to go in march I would have been a bit too late. \n\nSo I decide to make a reservation on a week day. My mom is a teacher, right from the start she thought I was overreacting to the whole wedding dress appointments. In her opinion I should wait till I \u201close some weight\u201d from now till July and then go dress shopping. \n\nI called and asked if she could make it on Wednesday maybe take a day off or leave a bit earlier than usual. She wasn\u2019t up to it and told me to go with my mother-in-law. \n\nThe moment I tried on the dress I video-called my mom. She stayed online with every other dress I tried on. Then I found the ONE! i was in love and I could instantly see myself wearing it on my wedding day. I ended up saying yes to the dress. My mom was not having it. She started crying saying \u2018weren\u2019t we planning on going to other boutiques to see other dresses\u2019 and \u2018how could I say yes to the dress without her there\u2019 \u2018how I should have made an appointment when she too was available\u2019. Not to mention how the dress is too expensive, even though I\u2019m the one paying for it . Mind you I tried to be considerate and make reservation that would work with her schedule but everything was full and every other day she wasn\u2019t available. besides to go in march is just a huge risk because the dress might not come in time.  \n\nso after explaining to the woman at the shop that whole situation, she agreed to schedule another day to reenact the yes moment but with mom being there. However mom got mad and said \u201cwhat\u2019s the point you already chose a dress it\u2019s not like my opinion matters.\u201d I have no idea what to do, this should have been my moment to be happy and excited but it turned bitter because of my mom. \n\nAlso her constant nagging about my weight and how I should lose 7 kg to look best. I would have made a scene if she was there in person, I held my tongue when she mentioned my weight during the call because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. She keeps holding that one comment I made about how I\u2019m going to look after myself, try eating better and exercising above my head the whole time I regret telling her about my plan at this point. And now she is hurt and doesn\u2019t want to talk. \n\nAnyway, Reddit, am I the asshole for following my heart and saying yes to the dress when my mom was not physically with me ?", "created_utc": 1675949258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xuqgx/aita_for_buying_a_wedding_dress_when_my_mom_was/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave her multiple options but nothing was good enough, she seems like someone who really like to be the victim. And then dragging you down by all the weightloss comments.

You found your dream dress and you don\u2019t even get to enjoy it like you planned because your mom is trying to sabotage your happiness. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond in trying to include her in the dress shopping, going so far as to be ready to reenact the moment, none of which you are obligated to do anyway. As much as your mom may think otherwise, this isn\u2019t about her. Congratulations on finding your dress!", "NTA....but wow....your mother has issues.  I am afriad this might just be the start of her issues with the wedding.

Your mom is T A and it's just a dress. Don't let her dampen your joy with her crazy expectations and negativity.", "NTA. Your mum is being completely unreasonable and over dramatic.

She should be happy for you for finding a dress you love.", "NTA\n\nIf it was just about being there she shouldn't care about whether or not her opinion matters. In fact, she shouldn't care much about that at all. Choosing a wedding dress is about you and YOUR wedding. That and her other comments make your mother seem entitled.", "NTA.

Just because she has this imaginary scenario of you losing weight & finding an off the rack perfect dress days before your wedding doesn\u2019t make it true. With the way the supply chain is now you were very smart to shop early. You did your best & she was there on zoom.

Ignore her pouting and jabs about your weight.", "Nta, live your life, your mother is toxic.", "NTA Don't let her ruin it by making it all about her. Waiting to lose weight is just a way to manipulate you into letting her be there, if you wait till July she can go to the appointment.
