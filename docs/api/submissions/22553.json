I had spoken to my parents on the phone before and shared some advice I got here. Yesterday we visited them to talk further. I actually didn't want to tell about the threats and messages I received, but my husband said my parents had a right to know. So he told them. And my mother got so furious, I was even a little scared of her. \n\nMy parents called my brother and demanded to speak to him. He usually brushes off any conversation unless he wants something. But not yesterday - my parents gave him (a German proverb) an enema, I've never eseen anything like that. They told him and held things up to him that had happened in the last 13 years, some of which I didn't even know. First of all, how his ex keeps lying and slandering to get her will and how my brother - often a victim of these slanders himself - is just completely useless. Yes, my mother called my brother useless. My brother didn't even get a word in, but he was visibly shocked to realize that he, too, had been lied to and manipulated by his ex (honestly, how stupid can you be?!). In the end, my parents told him he had the choice: grow a pair (I NEVER expected to hear that phrase from my mom. Ever!) and start being a father to his kids, or live with it that he does not get a lot of inheritance and that the money for his children is divided between the remaining grandchildren. It wasn't his money at any point, so he shouldn't whine or pretend he'll get something if his ex gets his hands on the money.\n\nAfter that, my parents called his ex. In a 3 minute conversation they told her that how my parents distribute their wealth is none of herbusiness and that if she tries to keep the kids away from them they will sue for access (grandparents rights). \"We have enough material that can be used in court\" - at that moment I really thought, my mother is now opening up to us about her past as a secret agent or something. Then they hung up, the ex sat there glumly and had nothing to say.\n\nMy parents told me that they had been documenting all conversations and lies for years because sooner or later they expected this kind of behavior. They showed me some examples and apologized for putting me in this situation. My parents told me that they still wished for the girls to get their money and that they would figure something out. I offered to keep my promise, because I love the girls and my parents.\n\nIn the end we all cried a lot but honestly I got some new kind of respect for my mother. She's a badass and I never knew.", "created_utc": 1689669940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152strj/update_aita_for_not_siding_with_my_brother_over/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Wow, OP's mom is awesome!", "OP your mom is officially a venerated badass and deserves something saying so imo \ud83d\ude02 I'm so glad your husband had your back and you told your parents.

You will never be the A-H for that.\nNta always", "~~That just links back to this.~~\n\nFixed by Goodnight. :)", "Fixed - thanks for the heads up!", "Nice! Thanks. :)"]}
