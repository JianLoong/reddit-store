My department has 6 members in total. We had a new colleague join our department a few weeks ago, we\u2019ll call her Jenny. I would say Jenny is a pretty friendly person, I personally think that in terms of creativity and overall work ethic, she is a pretty good fit for the team and an overall great addition.\n\nMy company operates in an office building where there is a foodcourt on the lower ground floor, comprising of about 8 or 9 stalls that serve different types of cuisine. My team has made it a habit to have lunch here, mostly for the sake of convenience and to cut cost, as the food served in the food court is generally a lot cheaper and affordable.\n\nOn Jenny\u2019s first day, I suggested that we offer to buy her lunch anywhere she\u2019d like, as a way of welcoming her to the team. Everyone agreed and so we let Jenny decide where we would all have lunch that day. Jenny chose a somewhat bougie cafe, about 15 minutes away from the office. The food was average and it costed us about thrice as much as we would usually pay at the food court.\n\nFor a few days, Jenny would try to persuade us to follow her to other similar cafes, because  she said she is used to eating in places like this. We were hesitant but gave in to avoid any awkwardness. During her second week here, she tried to do the same thing again, so we decided to have a discussion with Jenny and explained to her that the meals were too costly and we didn\u2019t find it necessary to spend that much money for lunch everyday on mediocre food.\n\nWe eventually convinced her to check out the foodcourt, but she didn\u2019t like it. She hated everything about it, especially the \u201ccheap and ugly\u201d vibe and refused to come back. Next day, we asked her if she would like to join us for lunch at the foodcourt, but she rejected our offer and said she would order in instead. We told her she\u2019s welcome to join us at the foodcourt with whatever she\u2019s ordering from UberEats, in case she wanted to chat with us. Jenny informed us that she would prefer not to go back to the foodcourt and expressed that she felt pressured everytime we offer.\n\nWe understand and mentioned that we wouldn\u2019t disturb her by asking anymore. The following days, we would say goodbye to Jenny and go to the foodcourt without inviting her. Yesterday, she made a formal complaint to our HOD and HR, saying that she\u2019s been very stressed lately because of how toxic her team is, how she felt like she was being bullied by us and that we were intentionally making her feel like an outcast by not including her in our lunch plans on purpose.\n\nI\u2019m being called in tomorrow for a meeting with our HOD and HR, and I genuinely want to know if it\u2019s possible that we did do all of the things she said we did, because I\u2019d like to apologise to her if I\u2019m in the wrong here.", "created_utc": 1677489286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d7fw0/aita_for_not_inviting_a_new_colleague_to_lunch/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once you've been contacted by HR/HOD do not approach Jenny unless another peer is with you to witness the conversation. She has set up a hostile situation. She is essentially saying, \"If I don't get my way then your team is toxic and a bully.\" \n\nShow up to this meeting with the outline of dates/times/locations/names and how you personally, and as part of a group, communicated with Jenny.  Use this post as an outline and include her quotes. You did not exclude her from your lunch plans. Meet with your peers since you all need to explain your actions in a comprehensive manner.  Jenny knows how to blow-up a team. She did the damage, not you (collectively) & per your comments, she may (or not) have a history of doing so. Best to you.", "You can tell HR that you are NTA. \n\nYou tried to be welcoming and went out of your way to try her suggestions. You didn't like them, as is your right. She tried your suggestion and didn't like it, as is her right. Everybody can eat where they prefer and since the majority of the team prefers the food court, it's only logical that you go there. The fact that she is missing out on social interaction is unfortunate but not your fault. \n\nThe fact that she is being such a crybaby about this issue, though, might be a red flag of how toxic she is going to be down the line.", "NTA. Jenny sounds bougie and spoiled and entitled AF", "NTA - Unsolicited advice: When you talk to HR, keep it to the facts and try to leave emotions out of it. If y'all cohesively tell a similar story and don't act out emotionally, she will likely be emotional (based on the limited info you provided) and give HR a better understanding of the person they're dealing with as long as the HR team is competent at their jobs. Jenny sounds like the problem. Also, moving forward, put whatever interactions you can with Jenny in writing and keep it hella civil.

If it's the latter , anticipate your team's mojo and workplace morale to be turned upside down. People like this feed off of workplace tension and dramatics. Got any intel on why she left her last position? I wouldn't worry though - if your HR department is experienced then they've seen this before and will likely snuff it out with a meeting that should've been an email. Always remember that HR is there to defend the firm - not the individual employee, and she filed a complaint against her entire team about something petty in just a couple weeks of being hired on. \ud83e\uddd0 Defend yourself by expressing your good intentions and that should be the end of it.\n\nGood luck OP.", "If you aren't paid by your company for your lunch break, please remind them that any working obligations end as soon as your break starts. But to be accommodating to all of your team, you consistently asked Jenny to join you for two weeks straight until she told you to stop because it felt like you were pressuring her. So all you are doing is following her wishes to not be disturbed on her break.", "NTA. Jenny is shooting herself in the foot by going to HR about such a trivial issue. HR is there to protect the company from lawsuits, not to further Jenny's best interests. She has now identified herself as a troublemaker and a threat to the company, and will forever be viewed that way by the higher-ups.\n\nLunch breaks are personal time, technically speaking. You can spend them with anyone you want, at any venue you want. You and some of your coworkers had already set up a lunch routine before Jenny entered the picture, based on cost and convenience. This routine was acceptable to those who chose to participate voluntarily. Others were free to make a different choice.\n\nYou invited Jenny to join, but she freely chose not to be part of your routine, based on her personal preference. There shouldn't be any problem here. Again, your lunch break is not company time. \n\nI doubt if there are any federal or state laws governing how people spend their lunch breaks, so HR is not going to appreciate Jenny filing a complaint about this issue. She is wasting their time and dragging them into unnecessary turmoil over something she should have been able to handle herself, as a mature adult.", "NTA.\n\nShe is the only toxic person in this story.", "Please give an update after the hr meeting, i'm too invested in this story, I want to know how it ends \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nShe made a formal complaint to the HR without previous talking to you or your HOD? It doesn't seem like a good fit for the team in terms of work ethics.", "NTA. You did everything you could. She clearly communicated she didn't want to go to the food court again. So be it.", "This is why I can\u2019t be bothered with coworkers", "NTA. If this is an accurate depiction of events then you absolutely haven\u2019t excluded her or created any hostility towards her.  Explain in the same detail and sequence to HR.", "During our lunch on her first day, Jenny mentioned she hops jobs a lot, because she\u2019s always looking for new challenges and opportunities. Starting to think this might not be the case.", "You stated what I was thinking, \"...a RED  FLAG of how toxic she will be in the future.\"", "Also point out she expressly said she felt pressured every time she was asked so she was told they would not ask anymore.", "We don\u2019t really use our GC for things like this, it\u2019s mostly used for updates about projects or clients. All of our invites have been irl, because all of our work desks are beside each other. I\u2019m more concerned about the part where she said we bullied her, according to our HOD, she mentioned that we ridiculed her and word by word mentioned that she isn\u2019t invited to any of our lunches.", "I don\u2019t think we would ever consider the rotation. Most of us on the team are unfortunately tight with money either because of rent, car payments or family. We eat at the foodcourt everyday because an entire meal is like 6 bucks with a drink included.\n\nHer cafes are about 30 dollars in total, for a dish and a drink. To pay that much once a week seems like a total waste of money, especially if the food isn\u2019t even above average.", "Stick with you gut on this one.  It sounds like an ongoing problem she has fitting in.  If people don\u2019t fit in with her she sees that as rejection.  It\u2019s thought, but NTA", "Or she is always looking for new places to act challenging.", "well, maybe the first part is, heh", "A little bit sus", "Well it\u2019s 5:1. Have each team member tell HR she was invited to eat in food court where you normally do but she refused and said not to bring it up again.", "That makes sense.  That's a lot of coin just to throw down on work lunch, which is what most people try to save money on if anything.  It seems your new colleague is also a bit out of touch and can't relate if she can't see how others may not want to spend $30 a day on lunch."]}
