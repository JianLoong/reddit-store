Since she never liked animals, my gf and I (22M) went and assessed the situation. They were only around 4 weeks old, far too young to be separated from their mom. We encouraged my sister and her family to leave the kittens alone. Despite telling them they were too young, she contacted our cousin who had interest in the kittens and ending up taking two of them for themselves.\r  \n\r  \nWe continued to monitor the remaining two. My sister made several remarks that really made it seem like she did not want them around, claiming that she doesn't like animals, that she and her family were allergic to them, and that they could not adopt them. We mentioned several times that we might likely have to give the kittens to the Humane Society near us.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a few days we came to the conclusion that the mom cat was not around, as both of them were losing weight. My sister asked us if they could be adopted by someone they knew, so that my nephews could visit them. I told her yes, but they need to be fostered for a few weeks first.\r  \n\r  \nThis morning we called the Humane Society and they agreed to take the kittens in today after hearing about their conditions. My sister did not object, and she and my 4yo nephew came along. On the car ride home, my nephew seemed to be feeling better but my sister started to cry. At home, she and my mom started berating me saying that I didn't give them enough time to process all the choices, and that they would have been willing to foster the kittens for a few weeks.\r  \n\r  \nI said that we told her our plan for a few days now, but she claims that she was busy working so she didn't have any time to think about it. I also mentioned how she wanted nothing to do with them, but now she claims they could've kept them in their insulated garage and fed them. I argued back that she doesn't have the kittens best interest in mind; she just wanted to keep them so that she can give them to someone she knows and visit them when her nephews wanted to without any of the responsibility of raising them.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked when she agreed, and that she didn't see anything wrong with that; that no one was being taking advantage of because the kittens would still be willingly adopted. We went in circles arguing for a bit before she started saying that I had guilt tripped her into letting them go in the morning and pressured her, and that I was putting the kittens before her mental wellbeing.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I didn't see any reason to keep arguing anymore because it was never really about the kittens (which she agrees on!) and that whether it was right for me to make an executive decision like that. I have her blocked now while we both cool down about the situation.\r  \n\r  \nMy gf and I feel like we made the right decision, but my family keeps insisting that I should have given them more time to think and not have been so rushed and forceful.

They need a heat source (less so than younger kittens) but an insulated garage is not it. They need to be weighed before every feeding to make sure they are gaining weight. In short, they are a LOT of work. The ONLY reason I can foster is because I work from home and don\u2019t have kids. \n\nTwo days was a long time to wait and see if mom showed up (I don\u2019t blame you, you didn\u2019t know).

You've clearly stepped over your sister's wishes, even after she let you know her own preferences for the kittens. She may not have been clear, but she did express interest in fostering them. You decided what was best without giving her time to consider it. She's family, you owe her at least that much consideration. Maybe she wasn't going to be the world's best pet owner, but she wanted to make her kids happy. Instead, you unilaterally decided what would happen.

I currently had a littler of 4, now a litter of 3. They were also born in a garden and initially found without mum, who had rejected them (although we did find her). Often when mum rejects there is a reason why.They've needed emergency medical care on 3 separate occasions (they're 5 weeks atm). They had a birth trauma and it was expected there would be some issues, but they also picked up a parasite. They need feeding 6 times a day at 4 weeks and can dehydrate really quickly. This isn't about your sister and she shouldn't have separated them or waited so long to get someone external to assess the situation. \nI've done animal rescue for a while now and it can be really emotionally overwhelming, which if you sister is feeling it upset atm, it could be because of that. If she wants to adopt the kittens she can do so after they've had medical care, but you don't play around with life.\n\nTo add. My kittens could have been all saved and healthy if the lady who found them had given us her address so we could assess the situation, instead of leaving them in a deadly situation- she also couldn't decide if she wanted to give them up or not, and played with their lives, which has caused severe medical complications and life long issues for them.", "[removed]", "Honestly you're right.
