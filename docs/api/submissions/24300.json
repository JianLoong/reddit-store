Numerous times.  \n\nThe big question is, why suddenly does he want back in?? That\u2019s the question I would be asking.  \n\nI would definitely be having that conversation with my brother and the way he is behaving. \n\nI think it presumptuous to assume that his daughter would be treated equally since she is basically a stranger.

You called him out on his behavior.\n\nHe was gone for almost 20 yrs, and now expects to be treated like family.  It doesn't work like that.  You have to earn your place, regain the trust of those you ignored.\n\nFor whatever reason, he has returned.  He is not being feted like the prodigal son, and others are naturally wary of his claiming to be family again.\n\nI doubt others in the family think you were wrong is calling him out\n\nNTA", "Nta. You used his logic and words against him.", "YTA \n\nHe probably doesn\u2019t have any other family or they don\u2019t want him. Probably why your brother had to adopt him in the first place. Then in spite of the way he acted as an angsty teen trying to make sense of his life, he runs back to the only people who he can consider family.

It does suck if the daughter heard you say that. Was there any particular incident that happened that and caused him to reject the family ?
