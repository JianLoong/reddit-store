{"id": 1454, "submission_id": "ymk9t5", "title": "AITA for exposing my mothers financial situation to my siblings and telling them not to give her money?", "selftext": "So I (26 F) have exposed to my siblings that my mother (50 f) has stolen money from us to help pay her mortgage and told them not to pay my mother any money as she owes all of us back for other loans on top of the 6k she stole.\nWe have a trust account, not technically a legal trust but a bank account managed by my mother now that my father has passed away. The account is to help us with things like buying a house or getting a car and we each roughly have 10k but it\u2019s an account where it locks for a certain period of time and yields a decent interest rate so you get it all back plus the interest after the lock in period. This means there was about 56k total in the account as of the last period. I am in the process of buying a house and when I asked for my money my mother confessed she had taken all the interest that had accrued to help pay her mortgage (roughly the 6k). Her reasoning was that I would have agreed to help anyway since she is my mother and she intends to pay us all back. I have since found out she has borrowed a significant amount from one of my more vulnerable siblings (20 m) and she gave roughly them $1000  to help move but they had to pay her back asap. They called me crying because they were having some financial issues themselves and by giving my mother the money they would have to do without money for food or heating. I ended up telling them to tell her to shove off as they owe this sibling in particular around 10k alone (I was not previously aware of this amount until the sibling called crying) and the money for the move can be taken as a partial payment toward that. Here is where I might be the asshole, the sibling was aware of the trust account and considered using some of their money to pay her back which is when I let it slip that she has already helped herself to it. I waited till I got all my money out of that account before confronting her and demanding she tell the truth to the others and now there is some infighting where some of my siblings agree that mother should never have borrowed money or taken from the account and others say we are being unreasonable and we should help our mother because she raised us and we can\u2019t let her become homeless. It may also be important to note that some of the siblings are completely broke and live in the house with my mother. I fully acknowledge we should not have kept lending her money when it was clear she would never be able to pay it back but I think that by helping herself to our account she went too far.", "created_utc": 1667623109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymk9t5/aita_for_exposing_my_mothers_financial_situation/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother should not be demanding to be paid back asap. The $1000 could be taken from his share of the trust, hence he doesn't need to pay it back.\n\nDeal with your own finances.
