{"id": 1454, "submission_id": "ymk9t5", "title": "AITA for exposing my mothers financial situation to my siblings and telling them not to give her money?", "selftext": "So I (26 F) have exposed to my siblings that my mother (50 f) has stolen money from us to help pay her mortgage and told them not to pay my mother any money as she owes all of us back for other loans on top of the 6k she stole.\nWe have a trust account, not technically a legal trust but a bank account managed by my mother now that my father has passed away. The account is to help us with things like buying a house or getting a car and we each roughly have 10k but it\u2019s an account where it locks for a certain period of time and yields a decent interest rate so you get it all back plus the interest after the lock in period. This means there was about 56k total in the account as of the last period. I am in the process of buying a house and when I asked for my money my mother confessed she had taken all the interest that had accrued to help pay her mortgage (roughly the 6k). Her reasoning was that I would have agreed to help anyway since she is my mother and she intends to pay us all back. I have since found out she has borrowed a significant amount from one of my more vulnerable siblings (20 m) and she gave roughly them $1000  to help move but they had to pay her back asap. They called me crying because they were having some financial issues themselves and by giving my mother the money they would have to do without money for food or heating. I ended up telling them to tell her to shove off as they owe this sibling in particular around 10k alone (I was not previously aware of this amount until the sibling called crying) and the money for the move can be taken as a partial payment toward that. Here is where I might be the asshole, the sibling was aware of the trust account and considered using some of their money to pay her back which is when I let it slip that she has already helped herself to it. I waited till I got all my money out of that account before confronting her and demanding she tell the truth to the others and now there is some infighting where some of my siblings agree that mother should never have borrowed money or taken from the account and others say we are being unreasonable and we should help our mother because she raised us and we can\u2019t let her become homeless. It may also be important to note that some of the siblings are completely broke and live in the house with my mother. I fully acknowledge we should not have kept lending her money when it was clear she would never be able to pay it back but I think that by helping herself to our account she went too far.\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sorry everyone this is long and I have clearly left out some info regarding where the money came from and my own circumstances that some people have asked about so please feel free to take this into consideration or not.\n\nThe money was left to myself and 2 other siblings over 10 years ago when a family member died. My father has been dead for many years already and this money did not come from him and these issues with taking money have existed long before then.\n\nI have had some issues in the past with family trying to manipulate my and retaliate which is not a good reason to wait until I could access my money and As I mentioned in the post I agree that doing so would make me at least look like an asshole.\n\nMyself and my 2 other siblings agreed to share the money with the other 2 as an equal split on the basis we would use it to contribute to a house deposit or vehicles if we need, since I want to buy a house I am accessing mine now.\n\nMy mother and one of my siblings together own 2 businesses that make decent money and I know this as they are connected to the actual legal trust we have of which I was a director but I decided to remove myself from this trust a while ago because I didn\u2019t want anything from my family and my other siblings could use the money more.\n\nMy life is in no way funded by \u201cdaddies money\u201d as he and my mother were dirt poor when he died and there was nothing to inherit. I have been finically independent since the age of 16. I honestly didn\u2019t think that any of this was relevant and thus why I didn\u2019t include it.", "created_utc": 1667623109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymk9t5/aita_for_exposing_my_mothers_financial_situation/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be wrong to withhold it.  You advised them not to give her money, but they can do whatever they want.", "Edit: OP has made an edit on their post elaborating since I initially wrote my comment, so I don't get why you're downvoting. Financial abuse of parents is very common, hence why I wanted more detail. OP has clarified, and obviously my comment is not reflective of the updated information.\n\nYou're 26 years old. 99% of adults your age do not have a trust fund from Daddy. I understand that your father has passed, but I don't understand why you are being financed at your age.\n\nYou also say that you have siblings still living with your mother, and she needs this money to literally keep a roof over her, and your siblings heads. If your father was alive they would be splitting their finances together, and paying their mortgage together, not financing their grown adult, independent children.\n\nIf your father left you all 10K each, I don't understand why you don't have a formal trust fund, instead of merely a back account. Even if he died intestate, you would draw up a formal, legal agreement with lawyers. Did your father just have some money in a bank account when he died, and you all decided you were entitled to it, and divided it as 10K each? You sound a bit domineering OP. You're dictating to your other siblings, and telling them to tell your mother to shove off. She literally has children reliant on her. I wonder if you, and your siblings thrust this arrangement onto your mother, rather than it being your father's instructions, or wishes.\n\nThe situation with your vulnerable brother is difficult. Your mother should not be demanding to be paid back asap. The $1000 could be taken from his share of the trust, hence he doesn't need to pay it back. However, I feel that we're not getting the full picture regarding any of this. I think you're leaving information out.", "ESH \n\nYou had a moral obligation to inform everyone about your mom's financial situation and the missing money, since you knew about it. You protected only your own interests. \n\nWho is the Executor of the Trust money? Someone needs to take over to protect everyone's assets and make sure your mom won't be left homeless. Do something asap.", "INFO: When you say she borrowed this money from your brother, do you mean that she borrowed it from his trust money, or he lent it to her out of his own pocket?", "NTA. Your mother is a thief. She took money that didn\u2019t belong to her and she knew it was wrong, that\u2019s why she hid it from you. You did the right things informing your siblings. If she needed money she should have approached her children, explained her needs, and asked for help.", "He lent it out of his own pocket", "Hi there, thank you for taking the time to reply and offer your option. I am in no way arguing with what you are saying I agree that I should have handled this situation better and clearly I need to add more context as I did not provide an accurate picture of my circumstances. I will make an edit to clear this up as I have been financially independent since 16 and the money is not theirs nor an actual trust but money left to us from a different deceased relative over 10 years ago.", "Okay. This sounds really bad.\n\nIf she was using some of the trust money (from her and dad) to cover expenses because your dad's early passing created unexpected hardship, and she was being open and honest and at least a little apologetic, that would be one thing.\n\nThat's not what this sounds like.\n\nIn my experience, people who \"borrow\" such large sums of money (especially from their children) tend to turn into bottomless money pits. There always seems to be another excuse or \"exceptional\" circumstance around the corner that tugs at people's heartstrings, and people end up giving them a little more, and then a little more, and then just a tad more just to get her through this hard time, and before they know it, they're broke just like the person they \"lent\" the money to.\n\nYou had a moral obligation to tell your siblings about your mom's suspicious relationship with money before they got sucked in like your brother. You fulfilled it.\n\nSounds like you have your money, so your siblings are free to make whatever decision they want with the information you gave them. If they think you're an AH for trying to protect them, so be it.\n\nNTA", "Okay, this changes the perspective a lot. It's a difficult situation. You're not responsible for your mother's financial situation. If she borrowed the money temporarily and intends to pay it back, the situation can be salvageable. However, this  is money left to you by a relative. I know you've taken your share, but it might be best for your siblings to take the money they're entitled to individually and put it in their own personal bank accounts. If some of them want to help your mother out with the mortgage, they can do this whilst maintaining control of their own finances.", "Thank you for replying, I still 100% agree it was a dick move on my part to wait to get my portion out first and I guess part of me still wanted to try and confront her first and I let my anger get the better of my and I may have made it worse (this the post right? Haha) and I hope that we can collectively figure out what to do now. I really don\u2019t think that my mother would be so spiteful to hurt anyone intentionally but I do worry that because it\u2019s such a sensitive issue it could go bad.", "I guess I was initially skeptical because there are so many cases of financial coercion, and financial abuse of parents. The extra info cleared everything up.\n\nYou say your mother has two business that make money. I wonder why she can't keep up with the mortgage. Maybe she needs help with managing her finances.\n\nUltimately, it's your money. It was left to you. Hopefully, you and your siblings can work this out."]}
