My child only slept in 2 hour stretches at 2 months, which is normal.

You will have a new baby and your wife will still be recovering from the birth. And babies can come late and C-Sections are a thing so she could be recovering from a C-Section that happened only 6 weeks ago. \n\nHowever, it seems like your family hasn't actually said anything to you and have accepted your decision.

But as someone who works extensively with birthing families- those first 6-8 weeks are also crucially formative moments in how OP and his partners family life will unfold. The support that his wife will get from him during that time- especially during a holiday time, will make a difference in their relationship. It will affect how she feels postpartum, it can affect their feeding journey, it can effect her chances of developing postpartum depression.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to dismiss the early postpartum period as no big deal, especially in the states where it\u2019s considered normal ish to return to work at 6weeks pp, but I cannot emphasize enough how important that time is.\n\nOP- NTA.

You could always quarantine yourself before going around the little one just to be safe. \n\nYou could catch a cold / the flu just making a run to the store.", "That\u2019s up to him and his wife to discuss. Postpartum isn\u2019t the same for everyone.", "NAH\n\nThis sounds like a judgment call to me. 2 months after giving birth is a rough time.

Hope all goes well!", "This is just it - between cold, flu & covid, it just seems like it\u2019s a big risk for a newborn.

Just too many unknowns under the circumstances.", "Yeah, if a medical professional is providing rationale not to attend, I'd listen to the professional.  I'd arrange with a family member a zoom call or maybe record a special message that could be played by for your brother?", "It makes the venue cheaper but travel more expensive for everyone else. Even if you didn\u2019t have a newborn at home, I\u2019d understand bowing out but with sickness, massive travel, and how huuuge the wedding is (maybe they could\u2019ve saved money via 100-200 less guests?), it\u2019s absolutely reasonable to not want to expose your kid to that, even indirectly.", "Very valid point and a lens through which I wasn't assessing things.

Not to mention that a last-second flight to rush home for an emergency would be impossible to get at that time of year -- and the good chances of a snowstorm snarling up the air traffic system would make it doubly so.\n\nIf they persist, point out that choosing to hold a wedding during the Christmas/New Year holiday period guarantees that it's not going to work for everyone, and it's fine that they chose to do so, but they have to accept it gracefully when people decline to attend -- especially when those people have a newborn baby who is vulnerable to viruses picked up during air travel, and a wife recovering from a traumatic medical event.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go. Stay with your wife and child. She will appreciate you being there for her and your baby. It\u2019s a long distance trip. It probably will cost a lot of money.

It seems like most of the people who fly end up getting sick and of course at any large gathering picking up a bug is a huge possibility. \n\nYou sound like a fine husband and will soon be a great Dad! Congratulations.", "Listening to your health professional is *always* a reasonable course of action. It sucks that you won't be going, but it really is the right decision.", "Appreciate the feedback. I want to start off my new role as a father on the right foot and not by putting baby or wifey at risk of getting sick", "As much as they knew my wife was pregnant there is a bit of a misunderstanding/misalignment on what my brother feels is safe/possible and what we feel is safe/possible. \n\nMORE INFO: my sister is pregnant, due just before the wedding, and is in South Korea and my brother still asked her if she would make the wedding/said if everything goes well, you'd be able to come, right?", "Ahh. Poor brother has no idea . I guess he's not a father yet?    You are making the best decision for you and your now family.  \n\nSee if it's possible to set up some face time or phone chats during various times even just real quick ones.", "Yeah, he's a couple years younger and not a father yet.
