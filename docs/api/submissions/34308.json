That's a major red flag right there. It's natural for you to feel uneasy about this revelation. Making a scene might not be the best solution, but you absolutely have the right to discuss your concerns with him and reevaluate the dynamics of your relationship. Don't downplay your feelings \u2013 they matter. If he values your relationship, he should be willing to address your worries.", "YWBTA if you caused a scene instead of just breaking up with him, which you should do if you're not happy being his second choice.", "Absolutely not. \n\nMajor red flags that he is openly telling you he would jump at the chance to date Amy, and the only thing that\u2019s stopped him is Amy\u2019s lack of interest.\n\nYou deserve better than this. A partner should love you and only you, with no consideration for dating anyone else. The fact he has a backup list is a major ick.

Did you ask him straight up if he would want to be with her if they were both single or did he just randomly tell you?

Personally I'd say ok, if you want to be with her instead of me then bye, don't be someone's second choice.", "No way. You want your BF to settle. He needs a kick up the arse- you need some security and value. You are worthy! Now move on from him.", "Don\u2019t make a scene, it\u2019ll make you feel more shitty than you already are feeling and you don\u2019t deserve to feel like that.

If he said it without prompting and just came out with it, then it\u2019s a red flag and you should have a quiet and serious conversation about what you both want.", "OP YWNTBA normally people don't look at their current partner and go \"man if I were single and she was single we'd date\" that is an odd thing to say to your partner.  We all know if we were single we'd date other people.  I wouldn't say start a fight but sit him and down and talk about it because it's concerning enough for you to run to the internet.  If he doesn't take your feelings seriously that's a whole other problem.", "Yeah, definitely bring this up with your bf. Like what the hell, does he have a whole list of potential partners? Sounds sketchy to me. But also try not to start a fight over it...maybe just calmly talk about why you're feeling uncomfortable and see where it goes from there.", "ESH. \n\n>It came about because I was stupid enough to ask \n\nIt's good you see that, because it's never smart to ask a question that you know has an answer you will not like.\n\nBut if he had a bit more sense, he'd have said  *I only have eyes for you* or something of the sort instead of feeding your insecurities.", "Honestly, you sound pretty justified in feeling jealous and insecure. Not gonna lie, your bf's history with Amy is sketchy AF. But making a big scene about it might not be the best move either. Maybe talk calmly and try to understand where he's coming from?

Just break up.\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to expect a certain, high degree of loyalty from a boyfriend or girlfriend who might become a future partner/spouse. That\u2019s what healthy relationships are about. When someone does something that casts doubt on their commitment to their current partner, and the partner objects, it\u2019s easy to brush this off as jealousy. In fact, this isn\u2019t jealousy. It\u2019s a recognition that your partner isn\u2019t living up to the commitment level you expect and deserve. Your boyfriend has let you know that he\u2019s settling for you because he can\u2019t get Amy. So what if he says he\u2019s over her!\n\nYou deserve better. You won\u2019t get it by making a scene. Just quietly break up with this boyfriend and move on. Nobody good is going to ask you out while you are in a relationship with him, so free yourself to find someone for whom YOU are his first choice.", "Bro what did she do \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "There is little point in making a scene. I mean, he chose you to be with, right? Yeah, he had a crush on Amy for a long time and if you weren't in the picture he might still be trying something. But you know what, YOU ARE the one in a relationship with him. Just focus on that.\n\nAnd stop indulging in extended conversations with him about his past exes and crushes. Talk about what you two like about each other. It's like you two are trying to stir up drama otherwise.\n\nThere is no fight here.\n\nYWBTA to start one.\n\nEDIT: if you DO feel like he doesn't really love you, that's a different matter entirely. Then you can decide to leave. Still no fight necessary.", "ESH apart from maybe Amy who has no interest in your bf by the looks of it.\n\nBasically why are you even having this discussion? He sucks for entertaining it and talking about other women with you. You suck for being jealous of a hypothetical situation which will never happen.\n\nNot to get all internet advice default but you probs need to break up. This doesn't end well for anyone. Apart from maybe Amy. She's hot and doesn't seem interested in this.", "Id say YTA\n\nI understand your insecurities but the point is he isnt single. As a guy I understand what he means which is which girls are 1 and which girls are 0. \n\nGirls do these all the time too. They can still have objective discussion about men and women even if they are in a relationship. \n\nAs long as he likes you now and not her I think thats what is most important.", "Small YTA but yeah. Everybody can find other people attractive, and consider they would be a great sexual or sentimental experience, and it's absolutely okay as long as they don't act on it if they are in a relationship. So basically your man was just honest and you're pissed at him for that ? Chill lady.\nI get that you're jealous and it rubbed you the wrong way but are you telling us that you NEVER find other men sexy or attractive, not even the clich\u00e9s like Ryan Gosling and others ?

Y do i think hes answer came from a question you came up with?? Does not make sense for him to randomely jus say something like that. Correct me if im wrong but did you ask him who he would date if he was single, nd when he refused o reply u kept asking?

It's not all too dissimilar to saying that he thinks his friend is attractive. \n\nIt is however definitely a red flag and something that you should keep an eye on.
