Not because of the gifts, but because of your elitist attitude. You're acting like a GED and community college are something that should be looked down upon and view/treat his accomplishments as lesser than your niece's. Get over yourself.", "This is a fine line you're walking here.  It will look like major favoritism to your family with what you did.  Dismissing another person's achievements because of your personal bias is not encouraging.  Think about the situation if you were in his position.  How would you feel if a family member barely acknowledged something you achieved,  however small it was?", "NTA. She is your niece and goddaughter\u2014so your relationship is different, hence a bigger gift. You gave her stepbrother/your step-nephew/your nephew-in-law a graduation gift, too, but it is understandably different because that\u2019s a different (more distanced) relationship. Did your sibling\u2019s in-laws do the same for your niece?", "YTA. Not everyone immediately knows what they want to do in life. Maybe try encouraging this person rather than completely dismissing his journey. The fact that this person was floundering and then was able to turn around and take steps to figure themselves out shows amazing commitment and should be rewarded JUST as much as your niece. What won't help is unsupportive people like you clearly demonstrating that you think they are a lesser person.", "You\u2019re technically NTA since you aren\u2019t your nephew\u2019s godparent. I\u2019d expect a godparent\u2019s gift to be a bit on the higher end compared to what they give other kids with whom they don\u2019t have that association.\n\nBut your attitude does make you an A. Your every line about your nephew sounds like solid dislike.", "NTA. You rewarded your niece for a hard-earned achievement. Your nephew did not accomplish the same achievement.", "YTA.\n\n40$ gift card is a bit hurtful, couldn't even think of something more personal to along with it?\n\nof course your blood relative and god daughter will get a bigger gift, but damn thats too drastic. Also knowing a kid for 7 years is a huge amount of time, 11 to 18 is all their teenage years.\n\nPoor kid, probably got a lot less support during his formative years and constantly got emotional neglected from this family, now he has no confidence on his skills or talents, and gets punished for that and labeled as not being worth the investment on his future.", "YTA for your elitist attitude, and a $40 gift card is so cheap and impersonal compared to what you gave your niece that it's worse than giving him nothing. You even diminish its value - sentimental or otherwise - in your own post. Are you going to tell him to be grateful for your generosity, too?", "YTA, it's favouratism and it's also (intentionally or otherwise) hurtful. Instead of helping your nephew (don't be gross and point out the specifics of his lineage) celebrate his success, you're turning it into a snub. That's a pretty sucky way to treat someone who went to the effort of getting his GED and is at least trying classes.\n\nIf you looked at this situation from the outside, who do you think would benefit from more encouragement, more help?", "Yta you old wench", "YTA. Have you offered to help him out or are you content to just judge him from a distance and punish him for not being as academically gifted as his sister? It's one thing to get someone a nicer gift than someone else but there is a HUGE difference between a new computer and a gift card.", "NTA. You're not their parent. You don't owe them equal treatment. Your niece's step brother probably has relatives from his bio parents' side. Do they treat your niece as if she were their blood? Do they give her the same attention and gifts that they give him?", "NTA\n\nYou might be accused of playing favorites, but it seems she is deserving of the gift due to her accomplishments, coupled with the fact that it will be essential for her subsequent education.  I'll pontificate that your choices were appropriate for both.", "Education isn\u2019t for everyone. Some people are just not academic and for your nephew that may be the case. It\u2019s wonderful that your niece graduated with honors but it\u2019s also wonderful your nephew passed his GED.  I just don\u2019t see the point in comparing or even looking down on him. There\u2019s so many factors that can impact ones ability with education and it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t end up incredibly successful. Him not knowing what he wants to do at his age is absolutely fine - there are people that are in their 30\u2019s still figuring it out. \n\nNTA because you can buy whatever gift you want. I recommend going easier on your nephew though.", "NTA for giving a god daughter a more significant gift but your attitude towards your nephew-in-law makes you an asshole for sure. He got his GED and he plans to go to community college, seems like a solid plan.", "NTA. You gave her a tool she will need to be successful in the program of her choosing. She is your God Daughter and your neice.\n\nYour nephew -- you've known him 7 years and it sounds like he's been kind of drifing. You gave him a perfectly appropriate gift for someone who is more distant from you and for someone who didn't have the same goals or drive.\n\nLook, gifts are not equitable but the boy is the equivalent of a family friend's child. Not your God Daughter. There is a difference and that difference is significant. Especially when it comes to purchasing gifts and money spent.\n\nThat said, back off of him on his drive. I went straight to college with lofty goals. My brother was a lot more like your step nephew... he is wildly successful in his chosen career and also a professor in it.", "YTA.   I can't believe people say otherwise.   Just bc he only has a GED & no concrete plans, you are just casting him aside.   Not knowing him but 7 years means he doesn't have to get an equal gift, but an expensive laptop for 1 and $4pl0 for the other?!?     If I was your sibling, I'd be furious.  If their roles were reversed, what would you do??", "NTA for gifting your goddaughter a significant gift\n\nYTA for your attitude more than your token gift re her step bro.", "You\u2019re joking right? Of course YTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA mostly because you have a different relationship. If it was me I'd give the kid $100 instead of $40 (what does $100 even buy anymore \ud83d\ude2d) and if he asks about the laptop say it was a tool for your niece. Consider contributing to a laptop for him if he actually starts needing one for school.", "YTA the only thing your nephew will remember is the disparity.", "NTA.  It is perfectly reasonable for you to define what kind of relationship you have with people.  If you have a close relationship with your niece and you consider him to be your brother's wife's son that is OK.  I think it is insane that people think you are required to create a familial relationship that just isn't there for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let's not do anyone a disservice by pretending otherwise.", "A GED is no worse than a high school diploma. The idea that it is is just elitism stemming from the idea that a GED is something failures and less-thans do. It could be argued that a GED is more indicative of ability than a HS diploma because while a teen will get arrested for skipping school, nobody forces anyone to take the GED. \nLet\u2019s not do anyone a disservice by pretending a GED isn\u2019t a signifier of hard work and dedication."]}
