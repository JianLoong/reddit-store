She knew about the affair and obviously has known for a while and only pulled that out as a blackmail card with her father.\n\nYou need time to get yourself together, cope with what is happening and deal with the betrayal of your husband and your daughter.  Personally I'd kick your husband to the kerb.   \n It's obviously been going on for a while as your daughter knew about it.  \n\nYour daughter is 20.

She is old enough to understand how this would upset and affect you, and she made the childish choice to keep it a secret from you. \n\nHowever, there is obviously more going on in your relationship with your daughter, possibly stemming from you trying to control her such as no tattoos. There is a reason why she did not have the loyalty or compassion to tell you about the affair. \n\nDump the husband, work on the relationship with your daughter when you are ready to forgive and move forward.", "NTA \nYour daughter did not tell you about your husband\u2019s affair.

There is simply not enough information here that implies that OP would stop paying her daughter\u2019s college fees if she got a tattoo. She told her daughter that she cannot get a tattoo until she is ready to support herself. The daughter might not have a job. The daughter might be a careless spender and the parents are trying to teach her how to budget and save. \n\nOP has found out about the tattoo AND that her daughter knew about the affair but selfishly kept it a secret because of tattoo, and she has not stated that she is going to stop paying for her college fees.

But no, she simply used the situation as a change to blackmail for her own gain and I can definitely see why you would be mad at her.", "Wow, with a daughter like that you really don't need any more enemies.\n\nShe is clearly manipulative.

We would need OP to provide more info to clear this up.\n\nAnother thing that makes me think that OP isn\u2019t blackmailing her daughter is that in her post, OP didn\u2019t state that she wasn\u2019t talking to her daughter because she got a tattoo. She\u2019s not talking to her daughter because she kept the affair a secret from her for selfish reasons. Obviously she\u2019s going to care more about the affair than the tattoo, but I feel like if she was that controlling, then she would have mentioned it in there somewhere.", "If you are over 18 and want to be supported and have your college education paid for, it\u2019s not a horrible burden to have to agree to some house rules. If you don\u2019t like those rules, you can support yourself and get all the tattoos you want.", "You mean the daughter that knew about an affair and didn\u2019t say anything about it until it could be used in her favor for blackmail? That doesn\u2019t sound manipulative at all to you?", "The adult daughter knew of the affair before getting the tattoo and chose to use it against her dad rather than tell her mom.", "That was a hypothetical? I asked OP what the consequences were because if they were severe enough, then the daughter may have felt trapped and agreed out of desperation to protect herself. In that case, mom should not be viewing her daughter as a conspirator (imo).", "Maybe they didn't really have good relationship to begin with. Atleast with these rules it doesn't sound like it. I get that she's upset about this. But I see it's the father being manipulative and ruining the family.", "I said OP is NOT the asshole for refusing to talk to her husband.  But her daughter is a completely different story.  She cannot police her daughter\u2019s relationship with her dad, so long as nothing wrong happens.\n\nAs for the tattoo thing\u2026 nobody has any clue how safe tattoos are.  Ink pigments have been found in lymph nodes.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it later came out that tattoo ink is a known carcinogen.", "I don\u2019t say it\u2019s always like that and that it\u2019s the case here, but well, it is so often. I understand the pain and feeling of being betrayed. But I smell something fishy, since the husband cheated and the daughter apparently found it very easy to cover for him. I don\u2019t think OP gives us the whole truth (or is able to do so).", "Not just facts: He blackmailed his own daughter without telling you. Was he right? No, but it's not just about him being selfish, it's about coercing and manipulating his own father. And if he can do that in this situation, he's become that dynamic. Have some sympathy", "My parents and 3 out of 4 siblings (basically all my brothers lol) tried talking me out of getting my first tattoo, which is a medical alert tattoo, because their understanding of tattoo studios was that it is run by gangs and MCCs and they are unclean and unhygienic places. Now whenever they find out about a new tattoo, they just roll their eyes and think I influenced my older sister and our youngest niece into getting inked lol.\n\nBut I have to say in this case, that OP's daughter definitely takes after her father.", "[deleted]", "That is what I was thinking. The more controlling and manipulative the parents are, the more likely their children are going to hide their life and information and be manipulative and controlling themselves back towards the parents. The mother created a daughter who doesn't come to her.", "Oh okay. I didn't know, I'm sorry for my ignorance", "I didn't know, I'm sorry for my ignorance", "I didn't know that, I'm sorry. Ive learned English through mostly American books, so i didn't know much about the alternative spellings. I didn't mean to be rude", "That\u2019s honestly fascinating. I\u2019ve never seen it spelled that way as an American", "But she obviously has if mummy dearest didn't know about it", "So here's how I read it - OP is willing to pay for education but only if the daughter follows all her rules. Daddy has been living under someone so controlling for so long that there was a release in someone that wasn't. Daughter recognised that and so didn't tell OP. Dad and Daughter have a mutual understanding of how bad OP is and so keep a secret for each other. I doubt Daddy was actually ever gonna tell OP about the tat", "Considering how crazy controlling OP is with someone else's body, this post gives you a peek at how she is with other stuff too... I wouldn't have told her either. Not my circus, not my monkey.", "Which means that at some point the trust in the relationship got fucked.", "Oh fair enough, sorry a lot of the comments are just straight up reading the text and seeing she's cutting off funds. Yeah I definitely agree that if parents had said anything that would potentially ruin her life over a tattoo, then NTA, she gotta look out for  herself", "but u voted for y-t-a overall so ur logic is:\n\nscolding daughter for tat + refusing to talk to daughter + husband for covering up cheating makes OP more of TA than daughter and husband actually covering up cheating\n\nsorry if u dont know how the voting works ! just reminding u in case thats rly how ur mindset is !", "Your post is confusing. The husband did not blackmail the daughter.", "It says nothing about losing financial help. It says they are funding her school and they want her to be financially independent before she got a tattoo. No paragraph says that she was going to lose financial support", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I'm not sure WHAT you're seeing coz sure while the comment about financially support her and not getting the tattoo are in the same paragraph, they're not linked? Like it's two completely different thoughts", "The daughter isn\u2019t the OP though.", "[deleted]", "Sorry I realized I somehow commented on your post and not the one intended. V sorry.", "He'd go running to tell her just coz they said don't get one and, despite the affair, she's his wife and coparent so they share these things? My mom was gonna tell my dad when she found out about my tattoo and there was literally no blackmail involved... honestly feel like we need to wait for OP to actually straight up say what the consequence was coz we're both assuming at this point \ud83e\udd72", "[deleted]"]}
