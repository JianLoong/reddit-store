Ever since then, I've been having whirlwinds of emotion where I am completely fine and other times where I have been breaking down.\n\nEarlier today was one of those moments. I was already on the brink of tears, about to sob and then my Mom came in to visit and to comfort me (I do not live with both my parents, its a mutual shared custody thing). \n\nI ended up sobbing pretty loudly when she held me and my dad obviously heard because a few minutes later while me and her were cuddling on the couch my dad ended up coming in and just not saying anything THEN ended up shouting at us saying he didn't feel loved, he was hurt, etc.\n\n I am so grateful for my Dad, and I know he has gone through a lot. But it was my Mom who showed up to hug me. If it had been him, I would've cried too. I don't blame him for being angry, but he shouldn't have taken that anger out on me when I was still mourning. \n\nI feel even more like shit then I already did to be quite honest and he hasn't come in yet as he normally does and apologize. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671195655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zne58h/aita_for_grieving_with_my_mom_instead_of_my_dad/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are your own person, he doesn't owe you.", "NTA - your father should not use a vulnerable moment to make it about him.

He definitely overreacted about something this small, compared to the loss of a beloved pet.", "NTA he probably felt you were choosing favorites but if he had been there then it would have been him. He needs to get over his feelings of anger towards his divorced wife and care for you like a parent would.", "NTA.\nReally, you sound like normal, and also your mother does. Your father screaming because HE DOESN'T FEEL LOVED sound really, really weird. He sounds like a jealous toddler, if I'm honest. The grieve was about your guinea pig, but he was seeking atention, and, now, your mother and you are sadder, but IT'S ABOUT HIM. I'm talking on my experience, and some people show their sadness by screaming and yelling to other people, many times under unreasonable reasons. This is a really toxic way of dealing with emotions.\nThen, you're allowed to be angry with your dad, and seeing his flaws, and be pissed by them. You don't need to point how grateful you are for what he had done in your life and almost repent from ranting about a clearly inapropiate reaction from him.\nFinally, sorry for your loss. You sound like a nice person.", "NTA and your dad sounds like he needs to be in anger management classes.

However, I would bet he's less upset about the guinea pig and more upset that he's by himself. He's handling that with absolutely zero tact and grace, since he could just come over and join you on the couch. He's not a total asshole, but he's the most asshole-adjacent in this story.", "NTA but there is a major underlying issue with your parents that's being expressed through the death of your pet. Perhaps your dad is grieving the loss of his family.", "NTA at all.  I'm very sorry for your loss.....know that it gets better over time...\n\nYour dad is a narcissist.  I know because my dad is one.  It's always got to be about him.", "NTA - losing a loved one is an extremely painful experience.  It\u2019s okay to need comfort from a particular person and not another. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nI also have Guinea pigs and I know that when losing one you\u2019re whole life changes as the daily routines you have for them aren\u2019t there. I wish I had some magical advice to make you\u2019re pain better and the best thing I can say is, take each day as it comes. Don\u2019t feel rushed to put away your little ones things. Ask for help when the time comes, and if you need to take breaks while doing it that\u2019s okay. \n\nGuinea pigs are very demanding and rewarding lil gremlins. I don\u2019t know if we are allowed to post pictures on AITA and if I could I\u2019d send you all the pictures I have of my gremlins if that would bring you comfort. Please know you\u2019re lil one loved you and had an amazing life, you took such good care of them living till 4 and half means they had a long and full life. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your dad is insecure. It's pretty mean to be shouting at you while you're so upset about losing a pet. He owes you the apology, not the other way around. People who are grieving need comfort as it comes and your mom was there at the right moment.\n\nYou clearly care for your dad a lot, even though he seems to have some issues. Maybe once you're back to feeling yourself you can let him know about the things you're grateful for and that you do love him.", "NTA. Your dad is jealous, but it's not your job to be attentive to him when you are grieving. In fact, he should be the one showing you some compassion.", "NTA, and frankly Dad is seriously out of line trying to make your grief about HIM.\n\nSounds like there's deeper issues between him and your Mom they need to work on", "This is the correct take on this post and on many others.", "I could not imagine doing that, I\u2019ve been in this situation where a Guinea pig has died and the idea of yelling at any of my family members \u201cI DON\u2019T FEEL LOVED\u201d is wild to me. \n\nSir, you need to step out of the room and re-enter when you get a grip. Like homie a precious little angel has crossed the rainbow bridge and your 15 year old child is getting a first hand experience of what death looks and what a dead body feels like now is not the time to be having a level 10 attention seeking meltdown.", "There has been quite a lot of loss this year for both of us.

I can't understand why that would be how he would react. It is absolutely bizarre. Like, a little brother? Sure. Father of the emotionally distraught teenager? No way dude.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Guinea pigs are so sweet. Your dad sounds like he has 0 empathy and a strange need for attention :/", "Those losses are hard, definitely. However he\u2019s an adult and a parent and there is no excuse for him making you into his emotional scapegoat. He needs therapy to sort his feelings out, and you have every right to set personal boundaries. You deserve respect as his child and as a human being. \n\nShame on him. You are NTA."]}
