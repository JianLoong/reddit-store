It is a manipulation. You asked him to get away from your door and he said \"no\". He wants to invade your space and make you feel like you shouldn't defend yourself or set reasonable expectations for his behavior. Ignore it. Screaming at him might not have been the best move cuz you've just given him what he wants - confirmation that he lives rent free in your head - but you're NTA. Document your creep neighbor's behavior, be calm and clear that you don't want him on your property, and invest in a \"no trespassing\" sign. Go to the cops every time you catch him on your property.", "NTA - you should feel safe where you live.  Either he doesn't know he's making people feel unsafe and you've educated him (he knows) or he's hurt because someone called him out on being a creep and he's embarrassed.\n\nMen like this count on people not wanting to embarrass them and then on them feeling bad after doing it.  Don't feel bad.  Hold you head up high and get a T-shirt that says \"You're a creep, leave me the F alone - yes, this means you Mr.L\".", "NTA, but I\u2019d report him to the police because his behavior is escalating. Stay safe!", "NTA\n\n>>blocking my door, so I couldn\u2019t come in MY house, this ticked me off. I screamed at him all he responded with was \u201cno.\u201d\n\nUhh yeah not okay. Don\u2019t feel bad at all dude sounds like a creep.", "NTA.\n\nCall the cops, get a restraining order.", "NTA. He likely would have kept being a creep if you hadn't made a scene. Him acting \"sad\" doesn't mean shit - a lot of creepers get away with it by making their victims feel bad about standing up to them.", "NTA but you need to follow through on your threat to call the police - he\u2019s playing a power game in trying to freak you out and invading your space and he now knows it upsets you so he will continue and possibly escalate this behaviour until someone gives him reason to stop it. Clearly he isn\u2019t going to listen to you so you need to call in more power to your assistance to make those boundaries stick.\n\nAlso: make sure you have a doorbell cam and record any instances of creepy behaviour in a paper diary with dates, times and the nature of the creepy interaction, and keep a photograph backup of the diary so that if his behaviour escalates or he attacks someone other than you, you already have evidence to present to the authorities if needed.\n\nSorry to sound all alarmist about this but\u2026 if other people saw fit to warn you then he\u2019s already sufficiently unafraid of the consequences to make his creepiness known to the entire neighbourhood, and you have to wonder what else he might do when he thinks he can get away with it.", "NTA.  He was seeing how far he could push your boundaries and who knows how far it would have escalated.  Plus he is a well known creep in the condo association.\n\nGood for you for protecting yourself.  It was really disturbing behavior you described.", "NTA, the guy wouldn't let you in your own home! Now I wonder if he has some mental health issue or is just a creeper.", "NTA - Document all the times he harassed you and report them to the management office or HOA whatever be the case.  If he persists call the police and report him for stalking and then go get a RO on him.  You do not have to put up with his criminality.", "NTA, but for your safety, please document any time he harassed you in any way. Dates, times, and where it happened. If you can take pictures or videos of any time he tries to interact with you, it'd be for the best.  If you ever need to show proof that he's been harassing you for an extended period of time, these are things you will need. Be safe OP!", "NTA. Do you have any sort of association where you live? Obv. neighbors have been powerless to affect this creep's behavior. This is a dangerous situation for you, & pls lock your door & windows at all times. I would go down to the cop station in person, file a report, get a copy, & see what they advise. The Creep is leveraging your age against you. Ffs, he's 62 & you're 20, so he thinks you'll be too wimpy & will let him slide like everyone else has. You did the best you knew how in the moment by yelling at him, & I'm sure he was quite pleased to get such a big reaction out of you. Listen, this is exactly how abusers work, going out of their way to play the pity me card. He's acting outrageous, so do not fall for it. If he knocks on your door with a little gift as an apology, or tries to engage you in conversation, say no. End of story. Don't feed him the energy he so desperately wants from you. He knows what he's doing bothers you & everyone else. It's how he gets off on a daily basis. Pls put safety measures in place. Sorry to say, too, at times the only solution turns out to move. You may end up choosing that route.", "NTA.\n\nIs it possible for you to get security cameras? He wouldn't allow you into your home and was peering through your window. This is harassment and you can absolutely (and definitely should) get a restraining order. Don't feel bad for him at all.", "Why does management allow this guy to continue?  NTAH.", "NTA and I would strongly advise you to talk to your landlord if you\u2019re a renter about them allowing you to break your lease and cover the cost of you moving to a new place. Your life is worth more than whatever it costs to get out of this situation.\n\nI had something pretty similar happen to me but I owned the condo and the stalker creep lived in a condo that his family owned. I called the police, I got the HOA involved multiple times and because they were an owner there was nothing I could do. I moved out and rented the condo out until I could sell it.", "NTA, but this may not be entirely his fault. If he has a medical condition, this could be a symptom. Dementia has a way of making people turn into a totally different person. My BIL is DD, and he would do something like this as a joke. It's not funny, but he doesn't understand that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
