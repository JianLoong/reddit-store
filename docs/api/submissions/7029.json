There's definitely something that you're not seeing here - you're not seeing that your boyfriend is an asshole.", "NTA. If my boyfriend disregarded my feelings and asked if I was just going to sit there and pout, I would have returned it too. You have no obligation to give someone a gift, especially after they've treated you poorly.", "He's showing you who he really is if he can't wait long enough for you to explain a situation before he blows up completely out of proportion to the issue. \n\nReturn the key and his things in a box while you're at it\n\nNTA", "Nah f this guy. Don\u2019t move in with him. Luckily he showed you himself before you\u2019re stuck with him \nNTA", "NTA, but do NOT move in with this guy unless you want to be berated on a regular basis. He is not mature enough to be in a relationship if he can\u2019t control his emotions.

I woulda straight up started crying if my lady surprised me with a brand new console.\n\nsuper glad you returned it and hope you got your money back. he can show a little bit of gratitude for you. you should def considering moving on bc if he\u2019ll scream at you for this, he\u2019ll scream at you for something else. don\u2019t move in with someone that doesn\u2019t appreciate you. keep your head up friend!!", "he showed you who he really is, please believe him.\n\nNTA", "Do yourself a favor and reconsider moving in with him.

You might want to observe hia behaviour a bit more before moving along with your relationship. If he acts like this now and you're crying, the future will only get worse unless his attitude improves.", "NTA.  I wonder why he freaked out over you being at his place without him.  Sounds like he might have something he\u2019s trying to hide.\n\nPlease rethink moving in with this guy.  You deserve better.", "NTA- don\u2019t move in, he showed himself\u2026..", "NTA\nHe's shown you that he's quick to anger, capable of making you cry, and also calls your crying pouting. He doesn't seem to understand emotions enough to control his own, or to care about your feelings. IMO a boyfriend like that isn't worth the heartache", "NTA\n\nYou were doing something nice for him and he didn't even give you the chance to finish what you were saying before he blew up at you.", "NTA. He completely overreacted to you grabbing his old XBox. He *gave* you a key. If you overstepped by bringing his old system to your place, he could have let you know in a hundred different ways that don't involve berating or belittling you. His reaction to the gift and comment about pouting are just the icing on the cake. That's *not* how a man treats a woman he loves and respects.", "NTA DTMFA", "NTA. Please really think about if this is behavior you are wanting to live with", "Nta, what you are not seeing is abuse. I don't know all your dating history but for him to go from 1 to 100 in an instance not apologist after he majorly screw up is suspicious.", "YNTA\n\nMan he wasn\u2019t even mad about you going in the place so if that\u2019s not what he\u2019s mad about idk what he\u2019s mad about.

Info: Does your boyfriend normally blow up at you if you touch his things?", "Oooh red flags everywhere. Run, OP.", "A little yes but I\u2019m going with nta bc his reaction was way out of place. I said a little bc you shouldn\u2019t have taken his system out of his place without his permission. With that said I want you to stop and think about this. He made a rash decision before knowing the facts and blew up. Really blew up. This, to me, is a red flag. Your relationship is him blowing up then getting mad at you when you aren\u2019t ok with his reaction.", "NTA and consider yourself lucky; you got a very clear preview of your future. Please don\u2019t let him convince you that his behavior was an isolated incident. Continue the relationship if you want, but press pause on moving in \u2013 even if you\u2019ve already ended your lease.", "NTA \n\nhis response was way out of line.

And seriously rethink dating him.", "Wow he behaved so poorly then tried to blame you for your reaction. Y T A if you move in after that display\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nBut you spelled EX-boyfriend wrong.", "Hm. Just a friendly caution to think about why you have the need to rush and move in together?

Sounds like she will be walking on eggshells and be the object of his anger quite a bit. Even if my boyfriend did something like touched my things that I didn't want him to I would ask politely. The yelling and not letting her talk in her own home is so manipulative. Most people can tell when someone is doing something nice or trying to do something sweet and romantic. He isn't even interested in what sweet thing his girlfriend is doing. He is only interested once she says she bought him something. I wonder why she felt she needed to buy him that.

It's like 85% on second kid and 15% on the first kid.  \n  \nHe blew it way out of proportion, but you also shouldn't have gone into his apartment and messed with his Xbox.", "Sorry this model is non returnable, you can either throw it in the trash or try to give it away, too defective", "I think she accidentally got the boyfriend at the jerk store. Common mistake.", "I mean even if you are firm on the opinion that she shouldn\u2019t have entered the place they are about to live together in, he could have easily said \n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t appreciate you going into the apartment and grabbing my things. Why would you do that?\u201d And she would have explained and from there he could have told her whether or not he\u2019s setting the boundary of her not touching his things in their shared space.\n\n\nBut cursing and screaming at your partner for that really tips the scale to them being the bigger ah. Since he hadn\u2019t set that boundary I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an ah unless she knew he didn\u2019t want her to touch his stuff and did it anyway.", "I disagree that it's 15% the kids fault. We could also make the false comparison that the girl in a bathing suit is 15% responsible for being raped because she knew men would want to look at her the same way the kid knew it would stir something up. That's not how the world works. HE calls it \"OUR\" home, she has a key, they agreed to live together. Even in the case of yea it's his space and his stuff, he had no right to belittle her. Ask her not to do it in the future, yes. Ask her why she did it, yes. Be upset, yes. But scream and not let her explain and continue to belittle and cuss her out and then not apologizing when the reason was in your favor and then making it so she's still the bad guy is bullshit and I think you know that, you either know that and are the victim, or you know that and you're the one that's done it. Or you wouldn't be defending blatant abuse over a slight misunderstanding."]}
