I have been taking care of my siblings since I was 8 years old, simply because we have shitty parents. Our mom is an abusive narcissist, and our dad is a passive aggressive drunk. I've been responsible for the lives of 3 children since I was a child. I love my siblings nonetheless.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my brother came to me and begged me to let my mom come and stay with us for a few week because she had recently became homeless. I was reluctant, but reality is my brother pays bills here as well and even though I don't have any love for either of my parents, I would never strip away the love my siblings have for them. As you can imagine, living with an abusive narcissist always ends bad. Despite making things unbearable since the moment she came. But last night was the last straw for me. My fiance or I make dinner every single night, and we all sit down and have dinner together. I made dinner last night and told my mom that it was ready, she got up and got in my face about how \"she doesn't feel loved here, and how I'm a shitty child\" and saying things to my younger siblings, that I won't even repeat. There was a lot of back in forth, but ultimately I got back in her face and told her she is a shitty mother. Told her how I've raised her kids for her, reminded her how 13 year old me and my 11 year old brother would have steal food from the store to feed our sister because she  chose a man over us and abandoned us. Told her how I sacrificed my life because her and my dad were shit parents. It ultimately ended with a lot if back and forth and me telling her she had 3 days to get out. I'm morally struggling mostly because of some of the things I said to her, I wasn't trying to be an AH but just years of everything broke me down.

She should have been a better parent.", "NTA - You tried to do the right thing, and unfortunately, your mother has thrown this back in your face.

Your siblings are extremely lucky to have a stronger older sibling as thoughtful and as caring as you are.\n\n>she got up and got in my face about how \"she doesn't feel loved here, and how I'm a shitty child\"\n\nRediculous comment.

You\u2018re setting reasonable and necessary boundaries to ensure your family\u2018s safety, and the AH in this story is clearly not you but your mother. She\u2018s awful and needs to face the consequences of her behavior.", "NTA, I'm sorry for your tough circumstances OP. If she can't appreciate you giving her a roof over her head, then it's her own fault. In the end it is your house and you can generally decide what goes.\n\nAlso, your mother definitely needed to hear that she was a bad mother.

You don't owe anything to someone who abuses you.", "Absolutely NTA, your mom and dad are awful people and deserve no sympathy from you, your mom is an abusive narcissist and your dad is a f*#king drunk, they deserve to be homeless after what they put you and your siblings through.\nOP you and all of your siblings obviously get 0/5 asshole points.\nBoth your mom and dad get the rare full 5/5 asshole points.", "NTA\n\nIf you're such a shitty child, then she doesn't need your help.\n\nTell your brother you understand he loves her, but you cannot live with her. She made her choices and needs to deal with the consequences.", "NTA. She's ungrateful and needed a reality check. People who will say you should never talk to your parents that way have never known parental abuse. You have a big heart for allowing her to stay out of respect for your siblings' contribution to rent and their relationship with their mother. \n\nMaybe what you said was better left unsaid, and I understand how you can feel bad about throwing dirt on her face, even though she provoked you. She is still your mom, and you will always feel attachment to her, but until she starts acting like an adult and humbling herself, then she gets to lie in the grave she dug herself for years. She might change, but rn it doesn't seem like she cares about anything but herself. You're doing what's best for your family.\n\nSorry about all this OP. Parents suck sometimes, and narcissists are extremely hard to deal with. You seem like a great parent/sibling, and I hope your lives  continue to get better from here.", "[deleted]", "NTA. OP you have put up with her shit for too long. You have taken care of her own children because you have a good heart and love your siblings. Your mother is not entitled to your love because she never gave you any. \n\nYou can't be TA for feeling how you are feeling, it is completely justified. She needed to be told how irresponsible she is, plus she is at your home.\n\nAlso, you should talk to your brother, let him know that from now on if he wants to have a relationship with your mother he can do it but without bringing it to your home. You need to set your boundaries and explain the reasons of it. You are not going to make your mother's life hell, but you deserve peace, and having someone so toxic around will bring all your home down, tensions, discussion everyday. \nYou have every right to start over, to build a healthy family environment, snd if she is an obstacle, cut her out.", "NTA, if your such a shitty child then your Mother needs to find her own way and not rely on you.  Your brother needs to know that narcissists do things only to feed their own needs and once he serves no useful purpose to her, he's on the shit list too.  I don't blame you for throwing her out.  She got 3 days more from you than she would have from me.", "Nope. She needs to go. NTA. I would have had her leave immediately.She is a grown adult and can figure it out. Your young siblings need protection. You are an amazing sister and human..", "Of course NTA. You were absolutely right to put her in her place.", ".....\n\nNTA, sorry.\n\nI believe in the situation you described, where your mother called you a shitty child and verbally abused minor children in your care (yes, your siblings), it was necessary for the children's well-being for you to go ballistic and insult your mother terribly right back, to reduce the possibility that they would believe your mother. It's a closer question than I'm entirely comfortable with, because she's their mother as well.\n\nThe 3-day notice to leave? Not inappropriate at all. She may not have squatters rights for two weeks depending on where she is, 3 days is a reasonable amount of time given how short she was with you, and her continued presence is a long-term danger to the children.", "So what's life been like since your brother and \"mom\" moved in next door?

I seriously doubt anyone else in the entire world has done anywhere near as much for her as you have. \n\nI have a similar type of family and I have spent years in therapy trying to move past it but something I learned is that when you are a child and forced to be responsible for adult things, you tend to spend the rest of your life believing that you are responsible for everyone, especially the parent(s) who put that on you.
