My fianc\u00e9, Adam, passed away three years ago. I (26F) have since married my husband, Benjamin (27M). Two months ago, we moved Adam's mother, Catherine, into the guest house on our property.\n\n Benjamin was initially enormously apprehensive about this, particularly given the strained dynamic between him and Adam. After much discussion and one massive argument when I picked my timing poorly and we were both too emotional, he understood my reasoning and fully agreed with this idea. He did express concerns that he simply wouldn't have anything in common with her: he's a city boy through and through whereas Catherine comes from a very traditional rural area. \n\nThe whole arrangement has worked out well: Catherine is very independent and there are some days that we barely notice that anything has changed. She is a great addition to the local community and has a much fuller life now, so she is delighted with how things turned out. I feel much better now I know she is supported enough not to worry about her quality of living. And Benjamin... \n\nAs it turns out, he and Catherine get along absolutely fabulously. You would think that they were old friends, or that she is some favourite aunt: he enjoys spending time with her and has expressed that he is very glad things worked out this way. He will walk with her, he will recommend her new books, and he will listen to her talk about Adam endlessly, and has said he rather enjoys hearing about him from someone with whom he is less emotionally entangled compared to me. For example, they play chess together almost every weekend. \n\nNeedless to say, I am feeling rather smug about it all (he knew what I was like when he married me).  For Christmas, I have got both Benjamin and Catherine several gifts of their own. I have also got them a new chessboard for their weekly games, which I think is very pretty. Benjamin had expressed before that he worried Catherine didn't have enough of her own things with her, so I think this will be a nice decorative piece as well. Would it be a total AH move to add a note to the tag on the gift saying something about \"I'm not saying I told you but checkmate\" or should I just let it lie and be content everything seems to be working out great?", "created_utc": 1670986070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlfa8z/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_told_him_so/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
