Yet my wife doesn\u2019t care and keeps doing it because she says it\u2019s her house too. The final straw happened when our child was sick in bed and she brought a friend in her room unannounced which only added to the frustration.

Luckily, the internet was only just becoming a thing! :S At 16 I decided, legally, to get the doctor to prescribe me meds (for endometriosis) she had previously forbidden, she threatened to sue the doctors.

I don't believe any child should have the door closed in case of emergencies you need to get to her fast. Unless taking a shower in the bathroom. If she leaves the timeout spot you have to start the time all over again. I hope eventually she starts understanding you don't argue with parents. also if she starts crying make sure to reinsure that you love her no matter what. Make sure she apologize at least I'm sorry not a whole explaining the situation. Once this is done a few times things should calm down. The wife does need to chill out and be more natururing and loving towards her daughter. Yelling doesn't solve anything it just makes things worse.

As soon as a child is old enough to start doing things for themselves, like changing and putting themselves to bed, they need to be able to have a level of privacy. The level.will only grow as she gets older.\n\nYou are stuck in a very hard place, however you have an opportunity to teach both of them how to deal with things like this. Do not back down from your wife on this. All she is going to accomplish is having your daughter resent her, end up going NC and it may effect your relationship with her as well.\n\nIt's also a teaching moment for your child on how yo deal with disrespectful and stubborn people when you're not at a point that you can go NC. Don't allow her to back down either. Teach her how to approach the situation in a more level headed and calm manner. It's going to be hard, hormones are going to be a thing soon and the emotional aspect of it, but it will be a good lesson in the long run. There are ways to set boundaries and stand your ground without completely loosing your mind.\n\nI think some of the issue is her age, she's still a young child. Which means your wife probably isn't viewing her as an individual person. Instead she still views her as her child. 8 is a little young for a lock on her door, but at the same time given the circumstances it may not be a bad idea. \n\nAs a kid I never really had an issue with things like that. I am an only child and my patents hardly ever just barged into my room, if they snooped they never said anything about it (other than your room is a mess clean it up). However, I had a lock on my bedroom door, idr how old I was but I know I was younger then most people would consider doing it for their own children. Part of the reason was the house was old and doors wouldn't always stay shut. My dad put up a little hook/latch lock. I can't think what it's called rn, but it's 2 peices one has an eyelet the other is a hook that goes into an eyelet, easy to get thebdoor open if absolutely need to but enough of a lock that people can't just open the door on their own. This may be a compromise (for you and your daughter, your wife will not approve I'm sure) with the promise that you will consider a better lock when she gets older. This very well may cause more issues, but it may also force your wife to start respecting your daughter as a growing individual and not just a child. \n\nThe petty part of me wants to be like, tell your daughter to start barging in on your wife. A \"treat people how you want to be treated\" tactic. But again, that's probably not the best course of action, especially with an 8 year old.\n\nINFO: Your wife says you're giving your daughter an authority complex? Does your daughter have any issues respect authority/rules/directions from you or any other authority figures in her life? I of course mean outside what would be considered a normal level of boundary pushing for a growing child. If not, next time your wife brings the \"complex\" issue up, point this out. Point out that the only one your daughter has a problem with is her, and it's due to the lack of respect she is shown. She is 8, not 2. She is only going to get older, need more privacy and need to be seen and treated like an actual person, not property. It's your daughters house too. \n\nIt sounds like you are doing the best you can to navigate these issues. You are trying to be supportive of both of them, you're just stuck in the middle. Which is another thing I think you should talk to your wife about. Talk to her about how her treatment of your daughter affects you, and your relationship with both of them individually as well as a family.

My mom is like your wife. She doesn't have any regard for our privacy as a child up until now. I'm already 21 and sometimes my mom would enter the comfort room while I'm in to tell something. she thinks it's normal since we're both girls but I'm not comfortable with that set-up even if I had told her a million time to wait until I'm done. When there are visitors, she often told embarrassing stories about me and like your wife, shows everything we had. As a child, it affected how I view things and it fuc Ked me up. So please stand stern for your child.", "NTA dude it actually sounds abusive to me how your wife use your daughter. Like the fact that she truly believes that the 8-year-old should have no rights, and was willing to wake up a sleeping sick child to invade her personal space with a stranger who was just going to walk in there and talk shit when this child was vulnerable and had no means of escape, sounds emotionally abusive.\n\nI really think you need to demand that your wife goes to therapy, with you telling the therapist exactly what the issue is, because your wife is a problem you need to put your foot down and defend your kid. You cannot allow your wife to do this to your kid, you need to step in. And I mean that, there are way too many people who just don't do anything to fight for their kids when their kids deserve to be fought for. If not you, who?\n\nYou should also get internal locks for your kids door. She shouldn't have to have that, but since your wife truly cannot respect her space, you need to give your daughter the ability to section herself away until your wife either changes, unlikely, or you and your wife are no longer together", "NTA ... Agree with you 100 percent. Of course your daughter is going to get mouthy if her mother is constantly ignoring her boundaries. Everyone deserves the right to set their own boundaries, especially children. They need to learn that their boundaries are important.  Your wife is teaching your daughter that her \"consent\" doesn't matter. That's going to lead to bigger scarier issues later in life. \n\nAlso we live in covidworld. If anything the past 3 years taught us we should be more considerate not to spread illness of any kind to others if it can be helped. \n\nWhy either of them wanted to risk it is so dumb to me.", "had to sign in to write this comment. \n\nmy mom was like your wife\n\nI no longer have contact with my mom", "NTA at all! Wife needs some therapy or something. Never understoid why parents cant resoect their childs privacy. Bringing a stranger into the kids space is awful. Get you and your daughter out!! Keep her safe!", "NTA. you\u2019re putting your child first as any decent parent should. your wife was wrong & should worry about your daughters privacy. she also shouldn\u2019t be showing off the house like that either because it\u2019s no one\u2019s business on how the inside of bedrooms look like or closets either for that matter. i feel so bad for your daughter, but props to you for understanding your daughter & listening to her while also trying to knock some sense into her mother.", "NTA but your wife really is. Respect is a two way road.", "> She believes I\u2019m giving the girl a complex and teaching her to have no respect for authority. \n\nShe is teaching your daughter that it is permisible to have her boundaries abused. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right. You do have to give it to get it even with children. It is earned not freely given. Her and her mother will never get along. I hate to say that but it\u2019s true. Your wife sees her as an object not a human. She she\u2019s her as something to be controlled and not a living being needing guidance. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still married to this woman. I refuse to stay w anyone who doesn\u2019t respect my children.", "INFO: Does your wife even *like* your daughter? This is awful behavior for a caregiver.", "NTA.  When I see my adult friends disrespect their children, I never think of them the same way again. Ever. Your wife is a problem. This is NOT going to become easier when your daughter becomes a teenager. Maybe this is a good opportunity to start on family therapy.", "Look up maternal narcissism, this has the tall tell sighns lf it\nNTA", "NTA. Kids deserve private spaces too. Plus it\u2019s also your house, so you should have a say in whether someone is allowed in her room or not.\n\nAlso, imagine if she was changing and your wife brought a stranger into her room. Imagine if she mentioned that to a teacher, or someone at school overheard her talking about it. That could potentially end badly for your family.", "NTA. You are 100% correct! She IS teaching your daughter that her feelings and privacy don't matter. She's teaching her all the wrong lessons about consent as well. She's teaching your daughter that her home isn't her home which is totally backwards! Even if your daughter doesn't pay the bills it's still her home! Your wife has no respect for your daughter and that's not ok. I'd be getting my child away from her ASAP!", "[Helpful resource to show your wife](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child)", "NTA. Your daughter deserves privacy in her bedroom. Your wife either learns to respect that or you should get her a lock.", "My best friend's parents are like your wife. They don't treat her as a human and yet expect her to worship the ground they walk upon and be at their every beck and call. Needless to say she's going no contact with them as soon as she moves out.", "NTA and your wife absolutely IS teaching your daughter that her privacy, boundaries, feelings, ect. don't matter. Your wife's take on your daughter's autonomy is potentially harmful to her development. Imagine that she grows up to choose relationships where she's disrespected and disregarded, all because her entire life your wife told and showed her that's what she deserved/how she should be treated.", "Absolutely NTA!!! \nReading this story brought back memories of how my mum disregarded my privacy as a kid (nothing as crazy/constant as this story but the one that stands out was literally calling every member of the family to tell them I got my period at age 13) and it just means I now don\u2019t trust her with big things until well after they happen.", "NTA but you really should\u2019ve taken a firmer stand a long time ago. Your wife is by far the biggest AH here for disturbing a sick child who was trying to rest. And it\u2019s also inappropriate for her to bring someone the child doesn\u2019t know well into the child\u2019s bedroom while the child is resting. Really weird of your wife.", "NTA\n\nSo in 10 years are we going to hear from your wife when daughter goes off to school that her daughter never calls to talk to her and no clue why?  \n\nI agree with you. \n\nYour daughter has feelings, opinions and ideas.  \n\nDo I think an eight year gets to run the house?  Nope. \n\nDo I think an eight year asking if her door is closed to please knock and give her a chance to respond?  Yes.  \n\nDo I think an 8 year old can tell a parent they can\u2019t come in?  No but if there has been a melt down and the child needs to chill I think it is reasonable to ask for 5 or 10 minutes for them to recover. \n\nI do think it was exceptionally rude of your wife to barge into you daughter\u2019s room especially when the child is sick. Pretty sure there is nothing so jaw dropping unique that it justified this.   \n\nWish you luck getting this turned around.", "NTA - keep doing what you're doing. Your daughter needs to know that someone is around to advocate for her when anyone (including her mother) makes her feel uncomfortable in any way. I wish you were my dad growing up.", "This is crazy! Your wife doesn\u2019t respect your daughter, her privacy, or her space! Your daughter is going to be out of there so fast if your wife keeps this up.

I can't even...", "Maybe the daughter is yelling out of pure frustration from having her needs so obviously disrespected and ignored, rather than yelling because of some inherent character deficiency? The \"mother\" here does not seem like she is concerned with her child's welfare.", "Honestly, kids need boundaries more than anyone so they learn what it means when their boundary is being crossed and how to handle it. And then we have adults who have a healthy understanding of how boundaries work because of how they were raised.", "Exactly, the idea of not giving a kid any boundaries can be unhealthy or outright dangerous. It's not something you mess with just for a question of pride.\n\nI grew up with a toxic mother, and other generally disrespectful family members. When I found myself at the hands of an abuser I just immediately accepted that I couldn't do anything about it because he was bigger and older. Bad times for everyone.", "I started knocking on my kids\u2019 doors when they were 2-3 yrs old. Never had a problem with them walking in on me. They knew to knock first.", "It\u2019s definitely one of the reasons I\u2019m NC with my mother who would still be barging into my room TO THIS DAY if I wasn\u2019t NC. (Staying there for holidays in my 20s was horrendous)", "Right? \"Daughter is sick so I won't be showing you that room\" is easy to say, matter if fact why of are you showing people your private quarters? Bedrooms are strictly off limits unless okayed by everyone who occupies it", "So do I.", "Unfortunately, my 1st 3 children all learned the hard way at that age to knock and wait for response before entering.  So when the 4th (who is also the last) was that age, she was about to make that mistake and all the kids started yelling, \"DON'T DO IT!!!  Do not turn that knob!  You do not want to see what is on the other side.\"  My husband and I were laughing so hard that we couldn't tell them it was safe to come in that time, lmao.  NTA, OP.  Mom has to teach respect to get respect.  Simple as that.", "I only did it once and it was a nightmare. All three kids got locking doorknobs the same day!", "*opens bedroom door* \"And this is where the magic happens!\"", "When I first bought my house I gave close friends and family a whole house tour but that's before the bedrooms became lived in with untidy closets and clothes waiting to be put away.\n\nFor a general visitor they see the public rooms.", ">I have never had a house tour that includes the bedroom. To me that is private space and I would feel weird as an adult going into someone's bedroom.\n\nI totally agree with you.  My very best friend purchased her house in the country during the Spring 2022 season and I wasn't able to visit until the mid Summer.  Because we are close like sisters, she kept insisting that I tour her house without her.  I had to insist that she takes me on a tour because I felt uncomfortable entering into private spaces (her bedroom/master bath) alone.  Then she wanted to show me her daughter's bedroom and was knocking on her door to let us in.  I told her to please stop because Lynn deserve her privacy and if Lynn wanted me to see her bedroom, she would give me the tour herself.", "I hope she screamed bloody murder when they walked in.", "Regardless of who's paying, I think when you decide someone will be living with you for the foreseeable future, you have therefore decided \"your\" house is now a shared space. Be it a roomie, a partner, or a being you created. And you should be especially aware of that if the other didn't have a say in the matter.", "It's worse as a teen, any time I tried to show interest in my mother's hobbies after years of being at each others throats. I was \"stealing her life's work\". I was just a doll/plaything to be shown off and if I didn't stay within what she wanted I was stuck running to dad for support so I was constantly in the middle as an only kid. Oh the screaming matches we'd get in... and loved to threaten to call the cops on me if things weren't going her way", "I\u2019m sorry we had the same mother"]}
