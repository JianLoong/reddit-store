But anyways, my kid was upstairs in her bed. Said she had just fallen asleep when her mom and the friend walked in unannounced, turned all the lights on. My wife was giving her friend a tour of the house. That is one thing I cannot stand, my wife feels the need to show everyone every single room, closet, even the inside of the fridge. Upstairs is the bedrooms and her office. There\u2019s really no for visitors to go up there, unless it\u2019s her office. \n\nMy kid was embarrassed, she knows the friend but not that well enough.

Few hours later the friend left and my wife and daughter went at it. She told her mom, she doesn\u2019t want people in her room and especially when she\u2019s in it. My wife bickered that it\u2019s her house, not our child\u2019s so she doesn\u2019t have a say. \n\nI 100% sided with my child on this one. I asked my wife what if our kid was changing her clothes and you just walk in with your friend, completely unannounced.

My wife again threw around \u2018it\u2019s our house I don\u2019t need to knock to open the door\u2019. My argument was, IT IS HER ROOM. Her privacy is just as important as our privacy, even though she\u2019s a child. Wife said this is a perfect example why our child has no respect for her, because I always side with her. So I said you have to give respect to get respect. She believes I\u2019m giving the girl a complex and teaching her to have no respect for authority.

Yet my wife doesn\u2019t care and keeps doing it because she says it\u2019s her house too. The final straw happened when our child was sick in bed and she brought a friend in her room unannounced which only added to the frustration. I stuck up for my daughter and reminded my wife we have both asked her to stop doing that.

Second for bringing a complete stranger into the child's room while she is sick and/or sleeping.  Third, for exposing said person to whatever the child has without warning them that there was a sick person in the house.  Because I am hoping so much that an average person would hastily decline to be exposed to a sick child in the midst of all the viruses that are currently rampaging.", "NTA, and it sounds like your wife would benefit from a parenting class and maybe some therapy. I always think that when people flip because \"they weren't respected\" it actually stems from a deep shameful feeling of not being worthy of respect and this is why it triggers them so much. If she doesn't figure this out her relationship with her daughter will never be easy.", "If a friend of mine did this to their kid I would lose a lot of respect for them. As the friend I would be spending a lot of time reconsidering our friendship and whether they are usually this rude, controlling and disrespectful of others.", "this mom sounds like my mom lmao", "My family was renting a house once for vacation, and we have family friends in the area and they spent the day with us. Somehow this ended up with the mom (a little older than my mother) giving a tour of the house to *her* friends while everyone else (ie my family, and her adult children) was out getting food while I was in the living room. I was pissed. Ground floor and outdoor area, fine. The rooftop balcony? Go for it. The bedrooms, where we weren\u2019t expecting anyone else to go into? Not cool. Luckily I was downstairs and not taking a nap.", "My son (13) had to put a note on his door for his visiting grandparent. Knock before entering and wait for a response. They were in to talk with him about every 10-15 minutes interrupting homework and talking with friends.\n\nI think he learned from me. I respect his privacy, knock & wait for a response. Its simple and it helps to build MUTUAL respect.", "I really like this approach. I think it\u2019s respectful and healthy.", ">NTA. Your daughter was sick in bed, she's not a display piece for your wife to show off.\n\nThis is at the heart of the wife's issue here. **She doesn't think of her child as a separate person with her own wants and needs; she thinks of the child as a narrative prop in The Grand Story of Her.** I would bet all the \"dramatizing everything\" reactions come from the wife being unable/unwilling to admit that she's mostly mad at her child for not being s good prop and keeping the story going as the author/mom intended. And the fact that the kid is mouthing off shows that the child has already learned being polite and civil isn't getting her boundaries respecting -- she's insisting on her personhood in the only way she knows how.\n\nThe OP's wife needs a parenting class or something. She's broken the parent-child relationship with her consistent depersonalization and disrespect, and she needs to do the work to earn back any trust or respect. **NTA**.", ">  Number two, your wife needs to knock. Number three, your daughter is 8. She should not be talking back to her mother. \n\nSo are you saying that even though the mom was in the wrong, the daughter should not have argued with her?", "I think we have the same mother. Lmao.", "I had to look back at how old this daughter is.....yep I read it right-  8 years old!!!  what the......    I don't think I ever thought it was an option to argue with my Mother at that age....lolll\n\nBut I will say Op and wife better get on the same page quickly or that 8 year old is going to be a nightmare 16 year old.\n\nEdit to say - Op's wife really needs to lead by example though.  Do as I say and not as I do never works.", "I\u2019m saying, that what I take from the post, is that the mom and daughter go at each other.  The daughter did not say anything at time of entry, but yelled later?  I don\u2019t believe an 8 year old child should be talking back to either parent, but, yes, the mom is in the wrong.  The whole dynamic sounds wrong and that is why I suggested therapy.  It is not the child\u2019s fault, but the fault of both parents for setting up this dynamic and it has been going on for 8 years, so all the child knows.  I think they all need intense therapy or you know we will be seeing a post from the child in future years.", "OMG are we all long lost siblings!?", "My father, an abusive man by most modern standards (and some older standards) and wouldn't have tolerated any mouthiness, still would have knocked before entering my bedroom.", "[deleted]", "There is a difference between talking back and defending yourself. I don't see the daughter being at fault here at all, and neither is OP for defending her. This is a hill I would die on. The wife is definitely the AH."]}
