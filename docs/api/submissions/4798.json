The two often have very different stories of what happened. \n\nFew days ago I was at work, our daughter stayed home from school because she\u2019s sick. Wife is a SAHM, but also is a hobbyist writer. She had a writer friend over, she hadn\u2019t been to our new home yet\u2026which isn\u2019t really new we moved in 5 years ago. But anyways, my kid was upstairs in her bed. Said she had just fallen asleep when her mom and the friend walked in unannounced, turned all the lights on. My wife was giving her friend a tour of the house. That is one thing I cannot stand, my wife feels the need to show everyone every single room, closet, even the inside of the fridge. Upstairs is the bedrooms and her office. There\u2019s really no for visitors to go up there, unless it\u2019s her office. \n\nMy kid was embarrassed, she knows the friend but not that well enough. Plus this lady is very critical when it comes to children, she thinks they\u2019re all lazy. If it was my wife\u2019s mother for example, that would have been completely different and our kid wouldn\u2019t have been bothered. Few hours later the friend left and my wife and daughter went at it. She told her mom, she doesn\u2019t want people in her room and especially when she\u2019s in it. My wife bickered that it\u2019s her house, not our child\u2019s so she doesn\u2019t have a say. \n\nI 100% sided with my child on this one. I asked my wife what if our kid was changing her clothes and you just walk in with your friend, completely unannounced. She has specifically asked previously not to bring people into her room, yet my wife continues doing it. My wife again threw around \u2018it\u2019s our house I don\u2019t need to knock to open the door\u2019. My argument was, IT IS HER ROOM. Her privacy is just as important as our privacy, even though she\u2019s a child. Wife said this is a perfect example why our child has no respect for her, because I always side with her. So I said you have to give respect to get respect. She believes I\u2019m giving the girl a complex and teaching her to have no respect for authority. I think she\u2019s teaching our kid that her privacy, feelings and requests don\u2019t matter.

This makes not only my daughter uncomfortable, but myself as well. Family is one thing but when it\u2019s friends, I don\u2019t think they should be going in our bedrooms to take a look. I\u2019ve asked my wife to exclude the bedrooms, my daughter has clearly been upset in the past when her room is put on display. Yet my wife doesn\u2019t care and keeps doing it because she says it\u2019s her house too. The final straw happened when our child was sick in bed and she brought a friend in her room unannounced which only added to the frustration. I stuck up for my daughter and reminded my wife we have both asked her to stop doing that. She doesn\u2019t see the issue though, and says I\u2019m teaching our kid to disrespect authority.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So, yeah, she's the AH because she doesn't care about your daughter's privacy. \n\nI have an 8 year old, too, who's become more private over the last year; she closes the door if she's changing or going to the bathroom.

You say their stories are different and I'm believing that your wife treats your daughter badly and that's why they fight constantly \n\nYou are definitely NTA. \n\nI'm a petty ass person so since she seems not to understand or respect that value of privacy, to get my point across I would start barging into her office for stupid ass reasons. I'd barge into the bathroom when she's in it for no reason as well. Why because somethings actions get your point across better than words ever will.\n\nWhat your wife is pulling will alienate your child and as soon as she can she will be gone! Or it will have horrible effects where people will stomp all over your child and she'll accept it as normal because it's what happens at home. She'll accept being disrespected, she'll accept being treated like crap, she'll accept having no privacy.

Your wife was wrong to just go into your daughter's room without knocking and for doubling down on her disrespect for your child. But do you notice how you belittle your wife here?

I think it can been seen in her eyes as you away pick ur daughter side, I mean you did say your not home often to see what happens but, your wife is dramatic. Which show you do think ur wife is in the wrong a lot of the times. Your daughter constantly disrespect her is another issue. I understand this case and I do t even view it as disrespect but, to it to be a problem to the point it\u2019s happening a lot is not ok. However about instead of yelling, talking to them about what the issue is. You said you don\u2019t witness a lot of these fights so, try an figure out what the issue is. However your Wife is AH for not giving her privacy.", "You and your wife are both AH. Your descriptions of your wife are very belittling and judgmental, and I assure you that your daughter picks up on that, even on a subconscious level.

I wasn't thinking about it being combined with showing people the whole home and the way he talked about that. Showing people the whole home isn't weird. I love seeing other people's closets (if they're comfortable showing me). Gives me ideas for how to organize mine sometimes. The inside of the fridge bit is weird if true (unless they have a fridge with very unusual features), but I suspect an exaggeration on his part. Showing people bedrooms is expected on a house tour, though not when they're being used or if the person whose room it is says no."]}
